    "the antennae ( modeled by toomre & toomre 1972 and barnes 1988 ) are the nearest pair of colliding galaxies involved in a major merger ( @xmath4  = 29 mpc , for @xmath5  = 50 ) .",
    "hence , this system provides a unique opportunity for getting the most detailed look possible at the consequences of a galaxy merger as evidenced by induced star formation and the conditions in the ism .",
    "each of the two colliding disks shows rings of giant h  ii regions and bright stellar knots with luminosities up to @xmath6 ( rubin et al 1970 ) , which are resolved with the _ hubble space telescope _ into typically about a dozen young star clusters ( whitmore & schweizer 1995 ) .",
    "these knots coincide with the peaks of h@xmath1 , 2.2@xmath7 , and 6-cm radio - continuum emission ( amram et al 1992 ; stanford et al 1990 ; hummel & van der hulst 1986 ) , indicating an intensity of star formation exceeding that observed in 30 doradus .",
    "co aperture synthesis maps reveal major concentrations of molecular gas , including @xmath82.7@xmath9 in the region where the two disks overlap ( stanford et al 1990 ; wilson et al 2000 ) .",
    "a recent k - band study derives ages for the star clusters ranging from 4 to 13  myrs , and measures high values of extinction ( @xmath10  mag ; mengel et al 2000 ) .",
    "x - ray emission from the antennae was first observed with the _ einstein _ ipc ( fabbiano et al 1982 ; fabbiano & trinchieri 1983 ) , with a luminosity of @xmath11 , larger than the average x - ray luminosity of normal spiral galaxies ( e.g. fabbiano 1989 and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "more recently the antennae have been studied with the rosat pspc ( read et al 1995 ) , rosat hri ( fabbiano et al 1997 ) , and asca ( sansom et al 1996 ) .",
    "these instruments reveal different emission components , including soft gaseous emission , which read et al suggested may be connected with a bipolar outflow , and harder emission .",
    "the 5  resolution rosat hri image reveals very complex and intricate x - ray emission , clearly dominated by components associated with the recent star formation activity , and suggests both an exceptional population of super - luminous point - like sources ( 3 were detected with @xmath12 ) , and a possibly extended and filamentary hot ism ( fabbiano et al 1997 ) .",
    "in this paper we present the first results of a deep  acis ( garmire 1997 , weisskopf et al 2000 ) observation of the antennae .",
    "the spatial resolution of  is 10 times superior to that of the rosat hri , allowing us to resolve the emission on physical sizes of @xmath13  pc , versus the @xmath14  pc resolution possible with the rosat hri . with this resolution",
    "we can easily detect individual x - ray sources and image in detail the spatial properties of more extended emission regions . at the same time",
    ", acis allows us to study the x - ray spectral properties of these sources and emission regions , providing additional important constraints on their nature , something that was not possible with the hri .",
    "here we summarize the overall results , as they pertain to the general morphology of the x - ray emission and to the detection of the different compact and gaseous x - ray emitting components .",
    "a detailed analysis of the point source component of 4038  will be presented in zezas et al ( 2001 , paper  ii ) .",
    "a detailed spectral analysis of the diffuse component and a multi - wavelength comparison of the ism will be presented in fabbiano et al ( 2001 , paper  iii ) .",
    "was pointed to 4038  on december 1 , 1999 , for 72.5  ks with the back - illuminated acis - s3 ccd chip at the focus ( observation i d : 315 ) .",
    "acis was at a temperature of -110 c during these observations .",
    "the satellite telemetry was processed at the  x - ray center ( cxc ) with the standard data processing ( sdp ) system , to correct for the motion of the satellite and to apply instrument calibration .",
    "the data used for this work were processed in custom mode with the version r4cu5upd6.5 of the sdp , to take advantage of improvements in processing software and calibration , in advance of data reprocessing .",
    "verification of the data products showed no anomalies .",
    "the data products were then analyzed with the cxc ciao software .",
    "ciao data model tools were used for data manipulation , such as screening out bad pixels , and producing images in given energy bands .",
    "the april 2000 release of the acis ccd calibration files ( fef ) was used for the analysis .    in preparation for further analysis",
    "the data were screened to exclude the two ` hot ' columns present in acis - s3 at chip - x columns 512 and 513 ( at the b and c node boundaries ) . besides causing stripes in the image",
    ", these hot columns contaminate the source spectrum at the low energies ( near 0.2  kev ) , as can be seen from fig .  1 where we show the integrated source count spectral distribution before and after the screening .",
    "no screening to remove high background data was necessary : the light curve extracted from an area of 7  arcmin@xmath15 showed a constant count rate of @xmath16 cts  s@xmath3 , consistent with a low - level background radiation .",
    "after completion of this work , the reprocessed chandra data products became available . while these data are generally consistent with those used in this paper , and therefore our results and conclusions stand , the aspect calibration was improved giving an improved absolute source position with 1@xmath17 error of 0.6 .",
    "the r4cu5upd6.5 data instead have an absolute position error of @xmath18 , which we have estimated by using stars in the field detected in x - rays .",
    "the revised absolute positions are consistent with our astrometry .",
    "we have used the latest and best chandra positional information for our comparison with other positional information ( optical , co , rosat hri , h@xmath1 ) later on in this paper .",
    "2 shows the full - band ( 0.1 - 10  kev ) acis - s3 field including the antennae galaxies .",
    "the data here are shown without any processing , beside that described above .",
    "it is clear that the emission is complex , consisting of diffuse emission regions of varying intensity and sizes , and of a number of bright point - like sources . on fig .  2",
    "are displayed a number of regions .",
    "the polygon , surrounding the emission area associated with the antennae galaxies , was chosen to be inclusive of the area covered by the optical images of these galaxies ; this region was used to extract the total source counts and spectral counts as discussed later in this paper .",
    "the circles surrounding this polygon are the background extraction areas for these estimates .",
    "point - like sources were excluded from the background areas ( dashed circles ) .",
    "3a displays an adaptively smoothed image of the full - band acis image of 4038 , generated with the ciao task _ csmooth _ , which adjusts the smoothing kernel in order to preserve a constant s / n across the image .",
    "each pixel in the input image is smoothed on its `` natural '' scale , in the sense that the smoothing scale is increased until the total number of counts under the kernel exceeds a value that is determined from a preset significance and the expected number of background counts in the kernel area . in our case ,",
    "_ csmooth _ was set to perform the background calculation locally .",
    "the smoothing function we used is a variable - width two - dimensional gaussian and the s / n was set to range between 3 and 5 over the image . in fig .",
    "3b we also show an outline of the optical image of the interacting galaxy disks ( white contours ) , the positions of the two nuclei ( ` x ' ) , the positions of peaks of the co distribution , indicating the areas of highest obscuration ( crosses ; stanford et al 1990 ) , and circles representing the source extraction areas of the three possibly point - like sources detected with the rosat hri ( x-3 , x-11 , x-12 ; fabbiano et al 1997 ) . comparison with the rosat pspc , asca , and einstein images is meaningless given the significantly lower resolution of these telescopes ( see fabbiano et al 1997 for a comparison between rosat hri and earlier , lower angular resolution data ) . in general , however , our results confirm early findings pointing to a complex x - ray emission field .",
    "the x - ray image shows clearly a number of bright point - like sources , extended emission associated with the numerous star - formation regions in the two disks and with the nuclear regions , and lower surface brightness emission associated with the entire stellar system , and possibly extending beyond it .",
    "4 is a true x - ray color image , where red corresponds to 0.1 - 2.0  kev , green to 2.0 - 5.0  kev and blue to 5.0 - 10.0  kev .",
    "images in each of the three bands were adaptively smoothed , as described above . to produce this figure ,",
    "the three images were then combined using the ciao tool _",
    "dmimg2jpg _ , which makes a color jpeg image ( or eps ) from three image files .",
    "this color image shows that the bright point - like sources have harder spectra than the diffuse emission : they appear white , implying that they emit in all three energy bands , with the exception of a ` blue ' heavily absorbed source , in the area of most intense co emission ( stanford et al 1990 ; see fig .",
    "3b , also note some ` green ' emission nearby , also indicative of x - ray absorption ) .",
    "the diffuse emission instead is softer ( red in the image ) , but it also shows some harder areas , for example in the vicinity of the nucleus of ngc  4039 ( the southern galaxy ; see fig .",
    "3b for the position of the nucleus ) .",
    "5 shows the spectral distribution of the detected counts from 4038 ( black ) , the coadded spectrum of detected sources ( blue ) , which is dominated by the luminous point - like sources , but includes a few faint , possibly extended sources ( see below ) , a representative bright point - like source spectrum ( green ) , and the spectrum of the diffuse emission ( red ) , obtained by excluding the contributions of point - like and small - scale extended sources from the image .",
    "the area used for the extraction of the integrated galaxian emission is shown by the polygon in fig .",
    "6 ( also fig .  2 ) .",
    "the background counts were derived from the circular regions marked in fig .",
    "the detected source regions that were subtracted from the overall source area are shown by circles and ellipses in fig .",
    "the four largest ellipses ( dashed in fig .",
    "6 ) indicate the presence of diffuse and possibly complex emission , and were excluded from the spectral count extraction .    a detailed discussion of source detection and point - source spectral analysis is given in paper ii .",
    "we find that there is a range of source spectra , but the most luminous ones tend to be quite hard .",
    "this is consistent with what is shown in fig .  5 , where the point - source subtraction results in the lack of emission from the higher energy channels .",
    "the spectrum of the diffuse emission has features pointing to the optically thin thermal emission of a hot plasma ( fe - l complex ; mg  k@xmath1 ; si  k@xmath1 ) .",
    "note that in fig .  5 the integrated galaxian spectrum becomes noise - dominated",
    "around 5  kev , while the coadded and individual bright source spectra are still significant at higher energies .",
    "this is because the general integrated spectrum is derived from a large area , that becomes background dominated at the higher energies .",
    "the individual detected - source counts instead were extracted from the small source areas of fig .  6 .",
    "we detect 48 sources at the 3@xmath17 level with ciao _ wavdetect _ , using scales from 1 to 16 pixels ( 0.5 - 8  ) ; 43 are detected in the 0.1 - 10.0  kev band , 2 only in the 2.0 - 4.0  kev and and 3 only in the 0.1 - 2.0  kev band ; 10 of these 48 sources can be identified with small - size features of the extended emission regions , while the rest appear point - like .",
    "the latter include all the bright sources visible in the images we have shown earlier in this paper .",
    "point - like detections range from 10 to 2063 counts per source , and account for 35.6% of the entire 4038  counts in the 0.1 - 10.0  kev band . in the ` soft ' ( 0.1 - 2.0  kev ) band point sources",
    "produce 31.5% of the total emission whereas they dominate the x - ray emission in the ` hard ' band ( 2.0 - 10.0kev ) , accounting for 81.4% of the total . at a distance of 29",
    "mpc , the ` point - like ' individual sources have an intrinsic luminosity ranging from @xmath19 to @xmath20 , where we have used a 5  kev bremsstrahlung model with galactic neutral hydrogen column density along the line of sight ( @xmath21 ) for all the sources detected in the 0.1 - 10.0  kev band , and spectra suggested by the spectral analysis ( paper  ii ) for the soft and mid - range detected sources . since these sources are likely to be absorbed because of the dusty environment in the host galaxies ( most remarkably , the ` blue ' source in fig .  4 ) , or may have some intrinsic absorption , these luminosities are likely to be lower limits to the real emitted source luminosities .",
    "full details of the source detection analysis and results are given in paper  ii .",
    "three point - like sources were reported by fabbiano et al ( 1997 ) from the analysis of the rosat hri image .",
    "of these ( see fig .",
    "3b ) , source x-3 is coincident with a  source ; x-11 includes both a bright  source and diffuse emission ; x-12 includes 2  sources .",
    "note however that the rosat positions may be affected by a few arcseconds aspect uncertainties , and also by the fact that the rosat hri sources were detected with 20 - 27 counts , which also include sizeable contributions from whatever else is in the source region . under these circumstances",
    "the source centroid would not be very accurate , because of detection statistics , and would also be biased by the surrounding emission .    the great majority of the detected point - like sources",
    "are associated with 4038 .",
    "using the  deep field ( giacconi et al 2000 ) estimates , the number of background sources expected from a comparable area ( @xmath22  square arcminutes ) is 1.7 at our soft band ( @xmath23kev ) flux threshold of @xmath24 . in this band",
    "we detect 34 point - like sources . at our hard band ( @xmath25kev ) flux threshold of @xmath26",
    ", we expect 1.4 background sources , and we detect 20 sources in the antennae . given the presence of extended emission local to ngc  4038/39 , we estimate that our source detection completeness limit is a few @xmath27 .",
    "the _ chandra _ images show extended emission features with sizes ranging from a few arcseconds ( few hundred parsecs ) to scales of the order of the entire galaxian system or larger .",
    "a complete study of the spatial and spectral characteristics of this emission requires a better calibration of the low energy response function of _ chandra _ acis than was available at the time of the present work , and so will be deferred to paper iii .",
    "we can still , however , summarize the principal characteristics of this emission .    as mentioned in @xmath282.2 , 10 of the relatively small - size sources detected in the antennae are not point - like .",
    "some of these sources are easily identifiable as peaks of the diffuse emission component within the antennae ` heads ' .",
    "these extended bright emission regions have luminosities in the @xmath29 range , assuming a thermal raymond - smith spectrum of kt=0.8  kev and galactic line of sight @xmath30 .",
    "the two nuclear regions are among the extended sources . at least in the case of the southern nucleus",
    ", the emission temperature may be higher that that of the emission associated with star forming knots in the arms ( see fig .",
    "4 , the x - ray color map , that shows some ` white ' in the southern nucleus area ) . assuming a thermal spectrum with kt=5  kev and line of sight @xmath30",
    ", we obtain luminosities of 1.3@xmath31 and 1.5@xmath31 for the northern and southern nuclear regions respectively .",
    "the nuclear regions may be 40% fainter if the emission is significantly softer ( kt@xmath32 ) , as it is more likely to be the case for the northern nucleus .",
    "we examined the acis image in the soft band ( 0.1 - 2.0  kev ) for evidence of the large scale galaxian outflow ( or halo ) suggested by read et al ( 1995 ) on the basis of the low angular resolution ( @xmath825  ) rosat pspc image .",
    "while our results are very preliminary and need to be confirmed with a proper spatial / spectral analysis of the extended soft emission ( paper iii ) , we note some low surface brightness , but significant , emission extending mostly to the south of the optical body in the acis image .",
    "this is shown in fig .  7 , where we display the results of an adaptive smoothing of a wide field section of the acis - s3 chip , with the data previously binned by a factor of 2 , resulting in 1  image pixels . analysis of the raw data shows that the x - ray surface brightness excesses seen in these regions range from 40% to 10% over the lower surface brightness ( background ) areas in the image .",
    "these excesses can not be explained with instrumental non - uniformities , because the maximum _ expected _ excursions from similar areas are of 5% at the most , based on the instrumental quantum efficiency uniformity map and mirror vignetting . in the south , for the same spectral assumptions as those used for the soft diffuse emission within the antennae , we estimate a luminosity for this very extended low - surface - brightness component of @xmath33 , assuming a raymond - smith spectrum with kt=0.8  kev and @xmath34 .      with the same spectral assumptions as above for the different galaxian components , the total ( 0.1 - 10 )  kev luminosity of 4038   is 2.3@xmath35 .",
    "the total point - source contribution is 1.1@xmath35 , roughly half of the luminosity , and the thermal extended components ( including the nuclear regions ) account for the remaining 1.2@xmath35 . considering the amount of guesswork involved in earlier estimates , that did not have the benefit of s resolution , these estimates are in general agreement with those of fabbiano et al ( 1997 ) .",
    "the  observation of the antennae demonstrates how exceptional the x - ray emission of merging galaxies may be , in comparison with that of individual relatively undisturbed spiral systems ( e.g. fabbiano 1989 , 1995 ) . in the antennae",
    "we detect a population of super - luminous discrete x - ray sources , a very luminous hot ism , and two bright complex starburst nuclear regions . while these components were suggested by the rosat hri observations ( fabbiano et al 1997 )",
    ", it is only with the combined subarcsecond spatial and spectral resolution of acis that we can firmly establish their presence and properties .",
    "8 shows the luminosity distribution of ` point - like ' sources detected in the acis observation , compared with the upper end of the luminosity distribution of x - ray sources ( most likely accretion binary systems , xrbs ) in m31 ( from _ einstein _ , trinchieri & fabbiano 1991 ; note that given the distances of the two systems , the physical resolution of the  observation of 4038  is within a factor of 2 that of the _ einstein _ hri of m31 ) . in the case of",
    "4038  we plot two histograms , coresponding to two different choices of @xmath36 : the filled one for @xmath37 , and the dashed one for @xmath38 .",
    "the m31 and the 4038  histograms have been arbitrarily plotted in different scales , for ease of display .",
    "the point of this comparison is not to compare the total number of fainter sources in the two systems , since the different incompleteness biases prevent it .",
    "however , in both cases , there are no such effects at luminosities higher than a few @xmath39 .    in m31 , and the milky way ( e.g. watson 1990 ) , xrbs have luminosities consistent with the eddington limit of @xmath40 solar mass accreting object ( @xmath41 ) . in the antennae instead we find 14 - 8 ( depending on @xmath36 ) sources with luminosities of @xmath42 or above , reaching as high as @xmath43 .",
    "one of these sources ( x-3 ) was detected , as possibly variable , with rosat ( fabbiano et al 1997 ) .",
    "super - luminous ` super - eddington ' sources were detected in some nearby galaxies prior to  ( e.g. fabbiano 1995 ) , and for some of them at least there is spectral evidence of accretion disks from asca , pointing to a black - hole binary counterpart ( makishima et al 2000 ) .",
    "these sources tended to be associated with star - forming regions , but they were rare , and the lack of angular resolution allowed the possibility of bright clumps of x - ray sources in most cases .",
    "what we see now is a population of these sources in a single galaxian system . as discussed by fabbiano",
    "et al ( 1997 ) , their large x - ray luminosities exclude that we are seeing the integrated stellar coronal emission of the star - forming knots .",
    "these luminous sources have hard spectra , reminiscent of galactic xrbs , very unlike the thermal spectra of the more diffuse emission regions ( figs .  4 , 5 ; paper  ii ) .",
    "given their luminosities , that are comparable with , or exceed , the total integrated luminosity of m31 , it is unlikely that they could be clumps of ` normal ' xrbs .",
    "we would need a few tens to a hundred neutron star binaries ( the entire x - ray emitting population of a normal spiral galaxy ) , clustered in areas with 100  pc typical sizes .",
    "if these sources are single xrbs , their luminosities suggest 10 - 100 ( or larger ) @xmath0 black - hole counterparts , unless they are all beamed .",
    "the detection of soft excesses in their spectra ( as in the sources studied by makishima et al 2000 ) would favor the black - hole hypothesis .",
    "this will have to await the soft - band calibration of acis .",
    "it is possible that at least some of these super - luminous sources may be very young supernovae ( e.g. schlegel 1995 ) .",
    "future monitoring of the antennae is needed to verify this possibility .",
    "any detection of variability , other than secular fading , would point to xrbs , e.g. as in the galaxy holmberg - ii , where the compact object is estimated to be a @xmath44m@xmath45 black - hole candidate ( zezas , 1999 ) , or as recently reported for m81 x-9 ( la  parola et al 2001 ) .",
    "similarly luminous sources , albeit in smaller number , are detected in m82 with .",
    "in m82 , the detection of variability ( kaaret et al 2000 , zezas et al 2000 , matsumoto et al 2001 ) demonstrates their xrb nature .",
    "the presence of a copious number of these superluminous sources in galaxies undergoing violent starbursts , such as 4038  and m82 , and their absence from more settled galaxies , with an older stellar population , suggests that they are short - lived objects .",
    "this may be consistent with a fast - evolving massive black hole binary hypothesis .",
    "this scenario has an interesting corollary : if what we see in the antennae today was the norm at the epoch of galaxy formation , then any spiral galaxy , such as our own milky way , may have an invisible population of massive black holes , the remnants of primordial massive stars and of spent super - luminous xrbs .",
    "a number of these systems may have sunk to the nucleus ( tremaine et al 1975 ) and contributed to the formation of massive nuclear black holes .",
    "however , it is also possible that the compact conterparts of these superluminous sources are more modest black holes , with masses in the range of galactic black hole binaries , if mild beaming is allowed .",
    "these possibilities will be discussed in a future paper ( king et al 2001 ) .",
    "superluminous hard sources in distant young galaxies may also be an alternate explanation for the hard deep survey sources identified with galaxies with no sign of activitity and explained with obscured agn ( hasinger 1999 ) .",
    "in the antennae , the integrated luminosity of superluminous sources is @xmath46 .",
    "their contribution to large galaxies in formation may be substantial .",
    "the  acis data reveal a spectacular and varied hot ism that had been only glimpsed at with previous asca and rosat observations",
    "( samson et al 1996 ; read et al 1995 ; fabbiano et al 1997 ) .",
    "while a detailed analysis of this multiphase ism will be reported in a follow - up paper , here we note that a comparison of the  image with the archival hst wfpc-2 h@xmath1-filter image of 4038  ( fig .",
    "9 ) suggests an interesting and intricate picture of the multi - phase ism .",
    "the x - ray data in fig .  9 were smoothed with a 2-pixel ( 1  ) gaussian , to retain the small - scale details .",
    "the x - ray contours are overlayed onto the h@xmath1 image .",
    "we used the reprocessed  data with the latest improved absolute position for this overlay ( see  2 . ) , which agrees with our astrometry based on field stars detected in x - rays .",
    "however , we have no way to check the astrometry of the h@xmath1 image with the available data .    although there is a general similarity between the distributions of hot and cooler ism , the two are not identical .",
    "we find regions where h@xmath1 and x - ray emission are both enhanced , e.g. regions e and b , where the x - ray and h@xmath1 peaks pretty much coincide , suggesting that the h@xmath1 and x - ray emitting gases are finely intermingled , but still retain their different temperatures .",
    "a similar situation is observed in the nuclear outflow of m82 ( e.g. watson et al 1984 ) .",
    "but we also find h@xmath1 cavities that correspond to peaks of the x - ray emission , suggesting a number of ` superbubbles ' , where x - ray hot gas appears to fill a hole in the h@xmath1 emitting - gas distribution ( regions a , b , possibly c , d in fig .",
    "typical diameters and luminosities of these h@xmath1-bound hot regions are @xmath47  kpc and @xmath48 .",
    "these superbubbles are extraordinary , if we compare them with already studied superbubbles in the more nearby universe .",
    "their x - ray luminosities are a factor of 10 - 100 larger than those of the gaseous emission of the 30 doradus nebula in the lmc ( wang & helfand 1991 ) , and of the superbubbles in m101 , that have typical luminosities of @xmath49 ( williams & chu 1995 ) .",
    "assuming temperatures of @xmath50k and spherical emission volumes of 1.5  kpc diameter , we derive typical masses of hot gas in these regions of @xmath51 .",
    "the nuclear regions of the two galaxies ( see   2 . ) also appear associated with extended thermal features , as had been suggested by fabbiano et al .",
    "there are two extended emission regions in the vicinities of the northern nucleus ( ngc  4038 , see fig .  3 ; region f in fig .",
    "the southern nucleus ( ngc  4039 ) is embedded in extended soft emission , but it may contain an harder emission peak ( figs .  3 , 4 ) .",
    "future spectral analysis of the acis data may help unravel this source .",
    "note here that there is a slight displacement between some x - ray and h@xmath1 features ( e.g. , regions f in fig .  9 , near the northern nucleus ) , that may be due at least in part to the compounded uncertainty of the hst and chandra astrometry .",
    "however , in other cases ( e.g. region e ) , x - ray and h@xmath1 peaks pretty much coincide .",
    "some of the hot x - ray emitting regions in the ism , and the nuclear regions themselves , may give rise to hot gaseous outflows , like those witnessed in nearby starburst galaxies ( e.g. ngc  253 and m82 , fabbiano & trinchieri 1984 ; watson et al 1984 ; fabbiano 1988 ) .",
    "the luminosities of the hot gaseous regions in the antennae , and therefore their thermal energy content , are comparable to or larger than that of the hot gaseous component of the nucleus of ngc  253 .",
    "region b in particular shows x - ray emitting plasma surrounded by a shell - like h@xmath1 structure at the base of what may be a local ouflow , as suggested by the presence of radial tendrils visible in a close inspection of the h@xmath1 image .",
    "the large - scale n - s extent of the x - ray surface brightness (   2.3 ) suggests the presence of large - scale hot outflowing ism out to @xmath52  kpc ( in projection ) from the galaxy disks .",
    "the  acis data of the antennae galaxies offer an excellent example of what high ( sub - arcsecond ) spatial resolution , joined with spectral capabilities , can achieve in the x - ray band .",
    "we have discovered a population of extremely luminous point - like sources , with x - ray luminosities well in excess of the eddington limit for 1  @xmath0 accretor , suggesting a young population of @xmath53(a few)@xmath54 black hole binaries , which are not seen in more evolved stellar populations , such as those of the milky way and m31 .",
    "we detect soft thermal emission , pointing to a varied hot ism in these galaxies , presumably powered by the intense star formation .",
    "features of this hot component encompass superbubbles associated with the star - forming knots , circumnuclear features , and an all - pervasive component , extending farther than the stellar bodies of the interacting galaxies and pointing to a galactic scale outflow .",
    "this is our first report of these data .",
