    "the direct observation of the orbital reflection @xmath33 @xcite using resonant soft x - ray scattering technique at the mn @xmath0-edges shows that the oo develops at @xmath15225 k and persists down to @xmath1520 k , with a small change in the gradient of the observed intensity below @xmath15100 k. comparing refs .",
    "@xcite , it seems that the oo causes an occurrence of the co and subsequently drives the formation of the long - range _ a_-afm spin ordering .",
    "the breakdown of co is due to the ferromagnetic spin couplings in crystallographic _",

    "in addition , the change in the temperature - dependent integrated intensity of the charge bragg ( 0 0 2 ) reflection at the la @xmath23-edges [ fig.[temdepen](a ) ] seems to be inversely correlated to that of the oo reported in @xcite , indicating a possible competition between them .",
    "therefore , complicated cooperation and competition between spin , charge , orbital and lattice degrees of freedom exist in double - layered lasr@xmath2mn@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "it is interesting to explore the reasons for the huge resonant enhancement of the charge bragg ( 0 0 2 ) reflection at the la @xmath1-edges .",
    "this peak is allowed for the tetragonal structure of this compound .",
    "the observed intensity in resonant soft x - ray scattering is mainly determined by the anomalous atomic scattering factor of the resonant atoms .",
    "this factor is a function of the incident photon energy _",
    "e _ and can be expressed as @xmath34 , where the imaginary part @xmath35 is related to the absorption coefficient and the real part @xmath36 can be deduced from @xmath35 through the mutual kramers - kronig relation @xcite .",
    "the x - ray absorption spectrum of this compound at the la @xmath1-edges needs to be measured for a quantitative calculation of the anomalous scattering factor .",
    "the anomalous atomic scattering factor shows a tensorial character and its anisotropy is mainly related to the distortion of the local environment . during the resonant soft x - ray scattering process , in principle",
    ", the excited electron is sensitive to any anisotropy around the absorbing ions , e.g. , the anisotropy of charge , orbital , spin or lattice .",
    "there are two types of distortion related to the mno@xmath37 octahedra in manganites : ( i ) one is the jahn - teller ( jt ) distortion that is inherent to the high - spin ( _ s _ = 2 ) mn@xmath7 ions , resulting in different mn - o bond lengths , which is accompanied by the oo of occupied mn 3__d _ _ orbitals ; ( ii ) another is the cooperative rotation corresponding to the mn - o - mn bond angle and tolerance factor , leading to lattice modulations and forming the octahedral tilt - ordering ( to ) .",
    "an octahedral to of pr@xmath38ca@xmath39mno@xmath40 and lamno@xmath40 @xcite was observed by tuning the incident x - ray energy to the @xmath41 , and @xmath27 absorption edges of pr and la , respectively .",
    "the structural data of lasr@xmath2mn@xmath2o@xmath3 as a function of temperature was not completed @xcite and the existing structural parameters were strongly challenged by the single - crystal study @xcite .",
    "the tetragonal symmetry ( @xmath42 ) of lasr@xmath2mn@xmath2o@xmath3 determines that the out - of - plane mn - o - mn bond angle along the _ c _ axis is 180@xmath19 and the jt distortion size which is defined as the ratio of the averaged apical and the equatorial mn - o bond lengths is close to unity down to 10 k [ fig .",
    "[ structures](c ) ] .",
    "thus no octahedral to exists in lasr@xmath2mn@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "however , the distortion mode developed for the mno@xmath37 octahedra based on the mn - o bond lengths indeed exists [ fig .",
    "[ structures](b ) ] , which was confirmed by a raman spectroscopy study @xcite .",
    "raman spectroscopy is a very sensitive probe of the local and dynamical structural changes .",
    "this scattering method can be used to study the complex interplay of lattice dynamics with ordering parameters in manganites . in @xcite , the major intensity of out - of - plane spectra",
    "was assigned to this stretching mode [ fig .",
    "[ structures](b ) ] and is independent of temperature .",
    "in addition , two tiny intensities in out - of - plane spectra were attributed to the raman allowed modes in the original structure : atomic motion of la / sr ions along the _ c _ direction . moreover",
    ", the rest appreciable intensities were thought to be from the activated modes , i.e. , the coupling between lattice distortion and co / oo . this octahedral distortion mode has little effect on the local crystal environment of la1 sites that locate at the center of four double - mno@xmath37 octahedra [ fig .  [",
    "structures](c ) ] , while it has a profound effect on that of the la2 sites due to the asymmetric action .",
    "indeed , based on the reported structural parameters at room temperature @xcite , the calculated local distortion sizes of la1 and la2 sites by fullprof suite @xcite are 3.2 @xmath43 10@xmath44 and 1.4 @xmath43 10@xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the strongly produced anisotropy of la2 sites may lead to the resonant enhancement of the charge bragg ( 0 0 2 ) reflection at the la @xmath1-edges .",
    "in addition , the observed competition between oo and temperature dependent integrated intensity of the charge bragg ( 0 0 2 ) reflection is in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite .    to summarize",
    ", a systematic resonant soft x - ray scattering study at the la @xmath1-edges on the possible lattice modulations and at the mn @xmath0-edges on the _ a_-afm structure in lasr@xmath2mn@xmath2o@xmath3 has been accomplished . at 15 k , well below @xmath46 @xmath15160 k , dramatic enhancements of the charge bragg ( 0 0 2 ) and the afm ( 0 0 1 ) reflections at the la @xmath1- and the mn @xmath0- edges were observed , respectively .",
