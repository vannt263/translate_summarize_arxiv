    "chemical reactions are frequently being used as case models to elucidate generic and rich mechanisms of spatiotemporal dynamics , such as the turing instability , spiral wave dynamics , bistability , spot replication  @xcite ( and the references therein ) by providing insights into mathematical mechanisms ( e.g. , linear , nonlinear , absolute , and convective instabilities ) that give rise to pattern selection  @xcite . among the more popular and exploited reactions are belousov - zhabotinsky and chlorite - iodide - malonic - acid ( cima )  @xcite . besides interests in chemical controls  @xcite , these reactions are also used as case models for biological and ecological systems , examples of which include morphogenesis , cardiac arrhythmia , and vegetation in semi - arid regions  @xcite .    an intriguing type pattern formation phenomenon ,",
    "demonstrating stationary spatial localization embedded in an oscillatory background , has been found experimentally in cima reaction  @xcite .",
    "such localized states have been observed in one- and two - space dimensions ( 1d and 2d , respectively )  @xcite , and attributed to a turing core emerging in a hopf background oscillating with a phase shift of @xmath0 , a behavior that is typical in the vicinity of a codimension-2 bifurcation  @xcite , a.k.a .",
    "flip - flop _ behavior or `` 1d-_spiral _ ''  @xcite .",
    "the 2d localization was attributed to the phase singularity that forces a vanishing hopf amplitude ( i.e. , pinning phenomenon ) and thus in turn emergence of a turing state  @xcite . in the mathematical context",
    ", it was shown that the spatial localization in the 1d hopf - turing bifurcation  @xcite bears a similarity to the spatial localization mechanism in systems with a turing - type ( finite wavenumber ) instability due to the homoclinic snaking structure  @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we focus on spatially localized comb - like structures in 2d , see for example fig .",
    "[ fig - multiple](a ) .",
    "we show that these localized states emerge via an alternative pinning mechanism over a much wider range of parameters and specifically , in a region where 1d homoclinic snaking is absent .",
    "we exploit the context of frequency locking and show that the hopf - turing localization in 2d further extends the resonant behavior outside of the resonance tongue  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the rest of the introduction section , we briefly discuss the phenomenology of spatially extended hopf - turing patterns and their impact on the 2:1 resonance outside the locking region ; in section  [ flipflopdynamics ] , we overview the 1d flip - flop localization and show numerically that planar 2d comb - like localized states exist in a wide parameter range where flip - flop behavior is not present ; in section  [ comb - like - states ] , we provide an alternative mechanism for localized comb - like states by deriving and analyzing three amplitude equations that represent a hopf mode and two perpendicular turing modes ; then in section  [ spirals ] , we exploit these insights to explain the comb - like spiral core ; finally we conclude in section  [ sec : concl ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "to capture the emergence of the turing core embedded inside a hopf spiral we start with a pure hopf spiral wave obtained for @xmath1 , as an initial condition .",
    "as for the planar front case ( fig .  [ front ] ) , direct numerical integration of   for @xmath2 shows formation of a turing spot inside the core due to the vanishing amplitude of the hopf amplitude within that region , see fig .",
    "[ spiralsdft ] . also here",
    ", the turing spot size increases with @xmath3 as expected .    to quantify the size of the turing core , we use again dft for each grid point within a window of 128 time steps , where each time step is made out of 100 discrete time iterations .",
    "consequently , each grid point corresponds to a 128-dimensional vector with the amplitude calculated from dft , where only the elements with the highest amplitude value are selected , as shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ spiralsdft ] .",
    "the frequency contrast allows us to define a criterion for the width ( @xmath4 ) of the turing spot .",
    "the spiral core width is found to agree with results obtained via the planar front , as shown fig .",
    "[ fig - ytwidth ] . in the depinning region above the stationary hopf - turing front condition @xmath5 , the spiral core expands by invasion into the hopf oscillations due to the dominance of the turing mode and the domain is filled with a periodic pattern ( not shown here ) .",
    "in summary , we have presented a distinct pinning mechanism for 2d spatial localization that is associated with the emergence of _ comb - like _ structures embedded in a temporally oscillatory background .",
    "these spatially localized states emerge in a planar form inside @xmath0 phase shift oscillations ( fig .  [ front ] ) or as a spiral wave core ( fig .",
    "[ spiralsdft ] ) .",
    "the mechanism requires coexistence of periodic stripes in both @xmath6 and @xmath7 directions and uniform oscillations , a behavior that is typical in the vicinity of a codimension-2 hopf - turing bifurcation . unlike the homoclinic snaking mechanism that gives rise to localized states over a narrow range of parameters about a stationary hopf - turing front in 1d ( a.k.a .",
    "flip - flop dynamics )  @xcite , the comb - like states are robust ( i.e. , do not require any maxwell type construction ) and exist over the entire coexistence range as long as the hopf state is dominant over the turing ( @xmath2 ) , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig - multiple ] and  [ fig - ytwidth ] .    in the context of 2:1 frequency locking , the comb - like states correspond to spatially localized resonances that further extend the frequency locking regime outside the resonance tongue .",
    "notably , localized comb - like states have been also observed in vibrating granular media and referred to as `` decorated fronts ''  @xcite .",
    "however , in these experiments they seem to form near resonant patterns and thus , their formation mechanisms may be unrelated to the hopf - turing bifurcation .    to this end",
    ", we have presented a selection mechanism that allows us to understand and robustly design spatially localized reaction - diffusion patterns in two dimensional geometries  @xcite .",
    "specifically , these results reveal the origin of intriguing spiral waves with stationary cores that have been observed in cima  @xcite and suggest the formation of localized resonant patterns outside the classical 2:1 frequency locking region , as such in the case of periodically driven belousov - zhabotinski chemical reaction  @xcite .",
