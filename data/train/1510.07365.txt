    "euclidean spacetimes are analytic continuations of lorentzian ones .",
    "this complex rotation of the time coordinate to imaginary values yields many insights into the quantum nature of space and time .",
    "euclidean methods are motivated by the formal similarity between the propagator for quantum mechanics and the partition function in statistical mechanics .",
    "results obtained by euclidean methods agree with those obtained by completely different techniqes , examples being the hawking temperature and entropy of black holes@xcite .",
    "@xcite for an discussion of euclidean methods and path integrals .    in the usual approach ,",
    "we identify a time coordinate @xmath0 and perform the replacement @xmath1 . in quantum field theory in flat space - time , the time coordinate of an inertial observer is usually selected for wick rotation . in a general curved spacetime , there need be no preferred time coordinate . in stationary spacetimes , the killing vector @xmath2 does give us a preferred notion of a time _ direction _ , but does not in general give us a time coordinate .",
    "one can use a time function @xmath0 partly defined by the condition @xmath3 .",
    "but , if @xmath0 is a time function , so is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is any function constant along the integral curves of @xmath2 .",
    "coordinate wick rotation in @xmath0 and @xmath6 give us different metrics which in general are complex .    in the special case of static spacetimes ,",
    "the killing vector @xmath2 is hypersurface orthogonal and determines a time function via @xmath7 , where @xmath0 is determined up to affine transformations @xmath8 , with @xmath9 constants .",
    "these transformations commute with wick rotation and result in the same euclidean metric in transformed coordinates .",
    "this permits us to define coordinate wick rotation ( cwr ) for static spacetimes .",
    "a good example is the schwarzschild exterior , where the timelike killing vector is hypersurface orthogonal .",
    "the method results in a real euclidean metric and correctly gives the thermodynamic properties of the schwarzschild black hole . except in special cases @xcite like static spacetimes , the procedure does not result in a _ real _",
    "euclidean metric .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to explore wick rotation in the tangent space , using a tetrad frame .",
    "wick rotation in flat space involves not only rotating the time coordinate , but also correspondingly rotating tensor field components to imaginary values . in theories with spinor fields , wick rotation also entails rotating the spinor fields @xcite . as is well known , in order to handle spinors in curved spacetime , one has to introduce tetrads .",
    "one might as well formulate wick rotation in the tangent space from the beginning using tetrads .",
    "as we will see , our method leads to _ real _ euclidean metrics .",
    "we do not need a globally defined time coordinate , but can make do with slightly less structure .",
    "what we _ do _ need is a local notion of `` time '' in each tangent space : a timelike , future pointing vector field @xmath10 . in the special case that @xmath10 is killing ( @xmath11 ) and hypersurface orthogonal ( @xmath12 ) , these local notions of time mesh together to give a global time coordinate and our method reduces to the usual wick rotation",
    ". we shall also be interested in black hole exterior solutions , where the timelike vector field becomes null on the boundary .",
    "indeed this is the most interesting application of euclidean methods . in this case",
    ", we shall also require that the integral curves of the timelike vector field lie in the exterior region .    in section",
    "ii , we describe the formalism we use and in section iii , apply this to some simple two dimensional examples to illustrate the difference between coordinate wick rotation ( cwr ) and tangent space wick rotation ( tswr ) .",
    "we show that unlike cwr , tswr yields real euclidean metrics . in section iv , we apply tangent space wick rotation to the kerr black hole , arrive at a real euclidean metric and compute the hawking temperature .",
    "section v is a summary .",
    "let @xmath13 be a lorentzian spacetime .",
    "the real metric @xmath14 i , j=0,1,2,3 can be locally expressed in real orthonormal tetrads @xmath15 g_ij = e^a_ie^b_j _ ab , tetrad1 where @xmath16 is the minkowski metric .",
    "the tetrad fields uniquely define the @xmath17 connection 1-form @xmath18 via the cartan structure equation : d e^a+a^a_be^b=0 spinconnection suppose now that we are also given a timelike future pointing vector field @xmath10 .",
    "let us choose an orthonormal tetrad frame so that @xmath19 , which is normalised to @xmath20 .",
    "( our metric signature is mostly plus ) .",
    "a wick rotation in the tangent space consists of the replacement @xmath21 , which of course results in a real euclidean metric . _",
    "ij = e^a_ie^b_j _ ab = e^0_ie^0_j+e^1_ie^1_j+e^2_ie^2_j+e^3_ie^3_j tetrad2 and the cartan structure equation yields a euclidean @xmath22 connection @xmath23 , which differs from the lorentzian connection only in that the space - time components in the internal indices are multiplied by @xmath24 : @xmath25 if @xmath26 and @xmath27 if @xmath28 or @xmath29 is @xmath30 .",
    "( @xmath31 vanishes since the connection preserves the minkowski tensor @xmath16 ) .",
    "thus the holonomy of the wick rotated frame is just the wick rotation of the holonomy of the lorentzian connection .",
    "the relation between the euclidean and lorentzian metrics can also be expressed without reference to frames : _",
    "ij = g_ij+2u_iu_j , ger where the reality of @xmath32 is manifest",
    ".    an interesting application of wick rotation is a black hole exterior @xmath33 , the region from which escape to infinity is possible .",
    "this region has a null boundary @xmath34 , the event horizon , which has signature @xmath35 . the null boundary @xmath36 is ruled by null generators .",
    "we suppose the black hole exterior is axisymmetric as obtains for the kerr metric and indeed all stationary black holes .",
    "since we require that @xmath10 is a timelike vector field whose integral curves remain in @xmath33 , it follows from @xmath37 that @xmath38 must approach a null generator of @xmath36 on the boundary .",
    "let us choose a @xmath10 timelike everywhere , but degenerating to null at @xmath36 .",
    "we can also choose it to agree with the coordinate time translation at infinity . performing a wick rotation leads to a euclidean metric in the bulk .",
    "but at the horizon , we find that each null generator @xmath39 of @xmath36 projects down to a single point @xmath40 in the euclidean space .",
    "a timelike curve @xmath41 that just grazes the horizon close to @xmath39 must therefore correspond to a closed curve encircling this point .",
    "this demands a periodic identification of the ends of @xmath41 in the euclidean space and thus an identification of the whole space by an isometry . in order to avoid a conical singularity at the image of the @xmath39",
    ", we must demand that the wick rotated holonomy of the null generator be trivial . indeed , that the holonomy is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a generator in the lie algebra of @xmath22 . as we will see",
    "this condition will give us the hawking temperature of the black hole .",
    "in this section we describe two simple toy examples to bring out the difference between cwr and tswr . these are all essentially two dimensional examples , in which the calculations and visualisation are easy . of course we must replace @xmath17 and @xmath22 above by @xmath44 and @xmath45 to make the correspondence with the two dimensional case .",
    "these are all cases in which both methods cwr and tswr are possible , ( because in two dimensions , stationary spacetimes are also static ) . but to make our point we use non static painleve - gullstrand coordinates .",
    "consider rindler spacetime ( with @xmath46 an arbitrary positive constant , @xmath47 ) ds^2=-g^2r^2dt^2+dr^2 rindler the cwr replacement give us ds^2=g^2r^2dt^2+dr^2 eucrindler the horizon at @xmath48 is a null curve that goes over to a point in the euclidean spacetime . requiring the absence of a conical deficit at @xmath48 fixes @xmath49 to be a periodic coordinate with period @xmath50 .",
    "this gives the correct unruh temperature @xmath51 .",
    "consider now the metric ds^2=-dt^2+(dr - v(r)dt)^2 pgr where @xmath52 and the range of coordinates is @xmath53 .",
    "( one can cover rindler spacetime with two coordinate patches , the painleve form for @xmath54 and the rindler form overlapping with it and continuing to the region beyond . ) in these coordinates , the metric appears stationary and not static , because of the presence of the cross terms @xmath55 .",
    "in fact , the metric ( [ pgr ] ) is simply a part of rindler spacetime ( [ rindler ] ) expressed in painleve - gullstrand coordinates , which are non singular on the horizon , @xmath56 .",
    "the coordinate transformation @xmath57 , where f(r)=-1/g[+-(1 + ) ] relates the two metrics ( [ pgr ] ) and ( [ rindler ] ) .",
    "if we were to use cwr and replace @xmath0 with @xmath58 in ( [ pgr ] ) , we would get a complex metric from the terms linear in @xmath59 .    however using tswr",
    ", we set @xmath60 , @xmath61 and the euclidean metric has the real form ds^2=dt^2+(dr - v(r)dt)^2 epgr    cc    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]      + ( a ) & ( b ) +    the line at @xmath62 is a null generator of the horizon and goes over to a point in the euclidean spacetime .",
    "this also removes the `` kink '' in the horizon at the origin of minkowski space . from ( [ spinconnection ] )",
    "we work out the lorentzian @xmath44 connection as a =- v(r)(dr - v(r)dt ) k , [ aexpression ] where @xmath63 is the boost , the @xmath64 pauli matrix @xmath65 , which generates the group .",
    "computing the holonomy of the lorentzian connection along the null curve @xmath62 , we find h(a)==holonomy where @xmath66 is the range of the integration .",
    "we require that the holonomy of this null curve when continued to euclidean values be trivial .",
    "i.e. we impose the condition -(v^2(r)) /2=2[vsqeq ] or @xmath67 as before .",
    "very similar considerations apply to the schwarzschild metric . by",
    "spherical symmetry , this is essentially a two dimensional situation ds^2=-(1 - 2m / r)dt^2+(1 - 2m / r)^-1 dr^2 + r^2d^2 sch cwr results in a real euclidean metric@xcite and the correct hawking temperature @xmath68 .    however , if we present the schwarzschild metric in painleve - gullstrand form ds^2=-dt^2+(dr - v(r)dt)^2 + r^2 d^2 pgs with @xmath69 the cwr would result in a complex metric .",
    "but if we set @xmath70 and then compute the euclidean metric , it takes the form ds^2=dt^2+(dr - v(r)dt)^2 + r^2 d^2 epgs the computation of the holonomy is then idential to the earlier case .",
    "we find that ( [ aexpression ] ) is still true , but now with @xmath71 .",
    "the condition that the euclideanized holonomy of the null generator is trivial gives us again ( [ vsqeq ] ) . using the new form of @xmath72 gives us the correct hawking temperature .",
    "in both the above examples , it was possible to transform to static coordinates and use cwr rather than tswr .",
    "the spacetimes were static , but viewed in non static coordinates .    in both these examples",
    ", we had a lorentzian manifold which was geodesically incomplete .",
    "geodesic completion of the lorenztian manifold would result in recovering the full spacetime - all of minkowski space in the rindler example ( 3.1 ) and the maximally extended schwarzschild spacetime in ( 3.2 ) .",
    "however if we perform a wick rotation , we get a euclidean metric which is also geodesically incomplete .",
    "completion then leads to a smooth riemannian manifold , _ provided certain global identifications are made_. these identifications involve modding out by an element of the isometry group and leads to a periodic time coordinate and a well defined temperature .",
    "the euclidean completion of the schwarzschild exterior has no counterpart of the schwarzschild interior or the curvature singularity .",
    "we now deal with the kerr metric which is genuinely non static .",
    "in fact , the situation is slightly worse : the metric is not even globally stationary , since the killing vector which is timelike at infinity turns spacelike in the ergoregion .",
    "we apply the same procedure , by computing the holonomy along the null generators of the kerr horizon and requiring that its euclidean continuation be trivial .",
    "the computation of the holonomy is entirely straightforward if a little tedious . for clarity ,",
    "we supress the details and present only the starting point and the final expressions .",
    "the calculation is aided by explicit formulae given in chandrasekhar@xcite , whose notation we use below .",
    "the useful short forms @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are standard in the kerr metric .",
    "note however that our metric signature is opposite to ref.@xcite .",
    "the kerr metric in standard boyer - lindquist coordinates is described by the null tetrads @xmath76 from which we find the inverse metric g^ij=(-l^i n^j",
    "-n^i l^j+m^i|m^2j+|m^i m^j)/2 kerr    the null generators of the event horizon at @xmath77 are tangential to @xmath78 . we transform from null tetrads to minkowskian ones by the transformation @xmath79 . writing @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is a parameter along the null generator , we need the integral _ 0^n^i a_i^a_b = n^ia_i^a_b , [ integral ] along a stretch of the null generators of the kerr horizon , where @xmath18 is defined by ( [ spinconnection ] ) . this matrix @xmath82 is a @xmath83 matrix @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the eigenvalues of this matrix are @xmath87 corresponding to eigenvectors @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath89 generates the transformation f = k , where @xmath63 is a boost @xmath65 in the @xmath90 plane .",
    "the @xmath91 plane is left invariant by this transformation .    from the condition of trivial euclidean holonomy we find",
    "= 2we can express the parameter @xmath81 in terms of @xmath66 the @xmath0 difference between the endpoints of c    _ 0^n^t d==eliminating @xmath81 in favour of @xmath66 gives ^-1=t_h= where all quantities are evaluated at the image of the horizon .",
    "this expression gives the correct hawking temperature .",
    "coordinate supressed for visualisation .",
    "some generators of the horizon are shown in red and a timelike curve just outside the horizon is shown as a thick green line . in the euclidean spacetime",
    ", this curve must be compactified to a circle . ]",
    "geometrically , the kerr exterior @xmath33 is a geodesically incomplete spacetime , since there are infalling geodesics that leave @xmath33 within a finite affine parameter ( or proper time ) .",
    "completing @xmath33 would lead to the maximally extended kerr spacetime @xcite .",
    "if we euclideanise the kerr exterior , along the lines above , we find again that the euclidean metric is also geodesically incomplete .",
    "the completion of the euclidean metric gives us a smooth euclidean manifold provided certain global identifications are made .",
    "all the points along a null generator of the horizon have to be identified as a single point in the euclidean manifold .",
    "thus the euclidean image of the @xmath92 kerr horizon is just an @xmath93 , which has codimension 2 .",
    "geodesics which meet this @xmath93 normally define a planar geometry very similar to the @xmath94 plane of schwarzschild .",
    "the requirement that the holonomy of a small circle encircling this point is trivial gives us the hawking temperature .",
    "whether or not one wants to consider complex metrics is largely a matter of taste . especially in dealing with the kerr metric and the newman - penrose formalism ,",
    "considerable use is made of complex analytic techniques .",
    "while these techniques have their value , the physical interpretation often demands that we deal with real metrics .",
    "it is entirely possible to use cwr to analyse the kerr metric , by going into the complex domain .",
    "our main point here is that a real domain analysis is also possible .    in the lorentzian kerr geometry , the horizon has topology @xmath95 , where @xmath96 represents the null generators . in the euclidean version",
    "the image of the horizon is an @xmath93 embedded in four dimensional euclidean space .",
    "since @xmath93 has codimension two , the picture is locally as shown in fig .",
    "1b , where the @xmath93 is represented by a point .",
    "timelike curves in the lorentzian geometry that graze the horizon map to curves encircling the horizon . a timelike three surface with topology @xmath92 just outside the horizon ( @xmath97 slightly positive ) maps to a three manifold of topology @xmath98 , which encircles the image of the lorentzian horizon .",
    "as would be expected , the region within the lorentzian horizon disappears entirely in the euclidean description .",
    "one sometimes writes cwr as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 varies from @xmath30 to @xmath101 and interpolates between lorentzian and euclidean manifolds . in the case of tswr",
    "we would have @xmath102 .",
    "the main difference is that cwr complexifies the manifold , while tswr complexifies the ( tetrad ) fields living on the manifold .",
    "if @xmath103 is hypersurface orthogonal ( @xmath104 ) , one may try to view this as complexifying t , the time coordinate .",
    "however , this interpretation works only if @xmath105 is killing . otherwise the metric would also have @xmath0 dependence and we would need to complexify @xmath0 in the metric functions as well .",
    "tswr works even when @xmath38 is neither killing nor hypersurface orthogonal over the manifold",
    ".    one may wonder about the role of @xmath38 and the arbitrariness involved in the choice of @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath38 provides us with a local notion of ` time ' , which in semiclassical gravity determines a division of modes into positive and negative frequencies .",
    "( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite which deals with field theory near a boundary . )",
    "note however , that it is only the behaviour of @xmath38 in the neighbourhood of the black hole horizon that enters into our discussion . in this neighbourhood",
    ", @xmath38 is essentially equal to the vector field whose integral curves are those of a locally non rotating observer",
    ". the arbitrariness in the choice of @xmath38 away from the horizon does not affect the calculation of the hawking temperature .",
    "another situation in which the cwr fails is the black hole interior .",
    "this region is not static even for the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "however , the geometrical ideas of this paper still apply .",
    "let us supress the angular coordinates for simplicity .",
    "the region has a singularity at the origin and a null generator of the horizon at @xmath106 .",
    "the null generator becomes a point in the euclidean spacetime .",
    "spacelike _ curve just _ inside _ the horizon must therefore encircle this point .",
    "the requirement of trivial holonomy yields the same value for @xmath66 as in the exterior . in this case",
    "the entire exterior region disappears from the euclidean description .",
    "we have a euclidean disc , whose centre is the image of the horizon and the singularity runs around the rim of the disc .",
    "the corresponding picture for the kerr case is far from clear . even for the schwarzschild interior ,",
    "the physical interpretation of this euclidean picture is unclear .",
    "we have shown that wick rotation does not need a global notion of time .",
    "a timelike vector field is enough .",
    "such a vector field induces a local notion of time in each tangent space . in static situations these local notions of time",
    "mesh together to create a global time coordinate , but there are interesting situations where this does not happen . in black hole exteriors , where there is a null boundary , the idea of wick rotation in the tangent space can be used to derive real euclidean metrics . the condition",
    "that the euclideanised holonomy of the null generators of the boundary be trivial ensures that there is no conical singularity in the euclidean space and correctly gives the hawking ( or unruh ) temperature in the examples we have considered .",
