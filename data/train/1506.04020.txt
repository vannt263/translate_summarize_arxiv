    "the nonlinear gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , as a mean - field theory , has been the dominant tool in describing the dynamics of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in ultracold atomic gases  @xcite .",
    "however , we face a quandary when the mean - field dynamics of a bec becomes dynamically unstable or chaotic  @xcite : on one hand , one may regard this instability as an unphysical artifact resulted from the mean - field approximation , since the exact dynamics of a bec is governed by the many - body schrdinger equation , which is linear and thus does not allow chaos ; on the other hand , the dynamical instability was observed in experiments  @xcite and it has been proved with mathematical rigor that the gpe describes correctly not only the ground state but also the dynamics of a bec in the large @xmath2 limit ( @xmath2 is the number of bosons )  @xcite .    our aim in this work is to resolve this fundamental dilemma .",
    "our study shows that the mean - field theory ( the gpe ) is only valid up to time _",
    "h = n + o(n ) , [ eq : timescale ] where @xmath1 is the lyapunov exponent of the mean - field dynamics and @xmath3 is a constant that depends only on systems . with this time scale ,",
    "the dilemma is resolved : on one hand , in the large @xmath2 limit ( @xmath5 ) , @xmath4 goes to infinity and thus the gpe is always valid just as proved rigorously in ref .",
    "@xcite ; on the other hand , the time @xmath4 increases with @xmath2 only logarithmically and it is not a long time for a typical bec experiment .",
    "for example , for the system studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , the lyapunov time @xmath6 ms .",
    "as the number of atoms in a bec prepared in a typical experiment is around @xmath7 , we have @xmath8 ms . as a result , the dynamical instability or",
    "the breakdown of the mean - field dynamics can be easily observed in a typical experiment as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this time scale @xmath4 is essentially the ehrenfest time , which is the time that the correspondence between the classical and quantum dynamics breaks down  @xcite .",
    "the usual ehrenfest time @xmath9 , where @xmath1 is the lyapunov exponent of the classical motion and @xmath10 is a typical action  @xcite .",
    "the similarity is due to that the gpe can be regarded as a classical equation in the large @xmath2 limit  @xcite .",
    "therefore , our result paves a way to experimental investigation of a fundamental relation in the quantum - classical correspondence  the logarithmic behavior of the ehrenfest time  as @xmath2 can be varied in experiments .",
    "we cast the quantum dynamics onto the particle - number phase space ( pnps ) , which is a rearrangement of fock states . in this phase space , for a nearly coherent state and in the large @xmath2 limit , quantum many - body dynamics is equivalent to an ensemble of mean - field dynamics .",
    "when the mean - field motion is regular , mean - field trajectories will stay together and the bose gas remains coherent .",
    "if the mean - field motion is unstable or chaotic , mean - field trajectories will separate soon from each other exponentially , leading to decoherence of bose gas and breakdown of the mean - field theory .",
    "so , there are two distinct types of quantum dynamics , whose difference can be characterized by the quantum fidelity for one - particle reduced density matrices .",
    "we investigate the ehrenfest breakdown numerically in the system of a bec in a triple - well potential  @xcite , which may be the simplest bec model that embraces chaotic mean - field dynamics . with this model , we verify numerically the ehrenfest time and show that our quantum fidelity can well capture the characteristics of two different types of quantum dynamics .",
    "the mean - field instability or breakdown has been discussed in literature  @xcite . however , a general and explicit relation between mean - field chaos , number of particles and breakdown time is still lacking . and in pnps",
    "not only such breakdown can be understood intuitively and quantitatively , but the significance of a local phase structure is also apparent , distortion of which leads to decoherence .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that many quantum systems become classical in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "a dilute bose gas belongs to this class of quantum systems : its dynamics becomes classical and it is well described by the mean - field gpe in the large @xmath2 limit . in this section ,",
    "we introduce pnps , where this quantum - classical correspondence in the large @xmath2 limit becomes transparent .",
    "any quantum state @xmath11 of a system of @xmath2 identical bosons with @xmath12 single - particle states can be regarded as a wavefunction @xmath13 over an @xmath14-dimensional lattice space , which we call particle number phase space ( pnps ) , via ( ) _ i = 1^m , where @xmath15 s are entries of the @xmath12-dimensional vector @xmath16 , @xmath17 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 . and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the creation and annihilation operators for the @xmath22-th single - particle state , with @xmath23 = \\delta_{ij}$ ] and @xmath24 .",

    "of course for any finite @xmath2 , the integral should be interpreted as summations over all @xmath16 in pnps .    as an example of our particular interest",

    "in such case , we say @xmath31 ( an @xmath12-dimensional vector with @xmath32 as its entries ) is the mean - field state of the su(@xmath12 ) coherent state @xmath33 .",
    "it is straightforward to show for this coherent state @xmath33 x_i = |_i|^2,(x_i)^2 = |_i|^2 ( 1 - |_i|^2 ) / n,[eq : width ] which indicate that the coherent state @xmath33 corresponds to a localized distribution @xmath28 in pnps that peaks around @xmath34 with a vanishing spread at large @xmath2 .",
    "and the wavefunction @xmath13 in pnps has a phase structure . for any @xmath16 and @xmath35 in pnps , ( ) - ( )",
    "= n _ i = 1^m ( x_i - y_i)_i ( 2 ) , [ eq : phase ] which shows a wavevector @xmath36 : @xmath37 .",
    "this phase structure is important as it will give us an estimate of the time @xmath4 in our later discussion .",
    "it is worth noting that when @xmath38 , there is no limit of the wavefunction @xmath13 because its wavevector @xmath36 diverges .",
    "overall , we find that the coherent state corresponds to a single - peaked wavepacket with plane - wave phase structure in pnps . in the following ,",
    "we shall discuss quantum dynamics in pnps and its relation to the mean - field dynamics .",

    "we are especially interested in the dynamics of a nearly coherent state @xmath42 , which satisfies the following two conditions :    ( _ i _ )  the distribution @xmath43 is localized such that @xmath44 for all @xmath45 ;    ( _ ii _ )  a local wavevector @xmath46 exists in pnps and varies insignificantly over a scale of @xmath47 , i.e. , @xmath48 for all @xmath49 .    with these two conditions and keeping only finite terms in the large @xmath2 limit , an approximate ( to @xmath50 ) eom for @xmath42 in pnps can be derived ( see eq.([approx ] ) in the appendix ) .",
    "mathematically , there are @xmath51-function solutions to this eom ( eq.([approx ] ) ) : (; t ) = _ i = 1^m ( x_i - x^0_i(t ) ) .[eq : delta ] in these @xmath51-function solutions , @xmath52 , @xmath53 satisfy the following equation i _",

    "conditions ( _ i _ ) and ( _ ii _ ) reflect our expectations of nearly coherent states ( see eqs.([eq : width ] ) and ( [ eq : phase ] ) ) .",
    "the existence of @xmath51-function solutions corresponds to the established result that for any time @xmath55 , when @xmath38 , coherent states at @xmath56 stay coherent when @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "the results above can be interpreted as follows : at large @xmath2 , for any initial state satisfying the two conditions , its time evolution may be regarded as the superposition of mean - field dynamics of @xmath51-functions , since any function in pnps can be decomposed into a superposition of a cloud of @xmath51-functions ! this is similar to the quantum dynamics of a single - particle wavepacket in real space : it can be regarded as a cloud of classical particles and each of them follows the newton s eom .    as the quantum - classical correspondence between a quantum wavepacket and a classical particle will break down at the ehrenfest time , the correspondence between one state in pnps and its mean - field description  one @xmath51-function solution ( see eq.([eq : delta ] ) )",
    " will also fail when the mean - field trajectories of the @xmath51-functions in the cloud diverge .",
    "the breakdown time @xmath4 can be estimated using a conventional strategy in quantum chaos as in ref .",

    "we have t + t + ( + ) n.[eq : check ]    the ehrenfest time @xmath4 in eq.([eq : timescale ] ) is obtained with @xmath62 , which is independent of @xmath2 or @xmath1 .",
    "numerical verification of this relation will be presented later .",
    "note that it is well - known that the quantum - classical correspondence may last far beyond the ehrenfest time ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "similarly , it is possible that the mean - field theory remains valid even after our first estimate @xmath63 ; this interesting and special topic will be left for future study .",
    "we now illustrate our results with an example . consider a bec in a ring - shaped triple - well potential  @xcite . under tight - binding approximation ,",
    "the second - quantized hamiltonian is ( as a specific case of eq.([eq : hamiltonian ] ) ) = -_1 i , j 3^i j _",

[ eq : mf ] shown in fig.[poin ] is a poincar section of the above mean - field dynamics , where two kinds of motion are evident : the central regular region is surrounded by a chaotic sea .",

    "the quantum dynamics of this model can also be computed rather easily .",
    "the evolution of @xmath28 in pnps is plotted in fig.[fig : schematic ] , where two types of quantum dynamics are clearly observed . in fig.[fig : schematic ] ( a , b ) , an initial coherent state , which is a gaussian - like wavepacket in pnps , shows no significant expansion or distortion during dynamical evolution . in fig.[fig : schematic ] ( c , d ) , the situation is drastically different : a similar - looking initial coherent state expands and becomes dramatically distorted after a certain time .",
    "the difference is caused by the fact that the initial state in fig.[fig : schematic ] ( a ) corresponds to a mean - field state in the regular region in fig.[poin ] while the one in fig.[fig : schematic ] ( c ) corresponds to a mean - field state in the chaotic region .",
    "it is obvious that the mean - field theory can not describe the dramatic quantum dynamics shown in fig.[fig : schematic ] ( c , d ) .",

    "@xcite , a remedy was tried unsuccessfully to bridge the gap between the mean - field theory and the exact quantum theory . in this work",
    "we have shown that there exists a general time scale @xmath4 in terms of lyapunov exponent and number of bosons beyond which the mean - field theory fails . in the following",
    ", we shall introduce a quantum fidelity to distinguish the two types of quantum dynamics shown in fig.[fig : schematic ] without using mean - field formalism , and confirm the time scale @xmath4 numerically .      to quantify the loss of coherence in the quantum evolution as shown in fig.[fig : schematic ] ( d ) ,",
    "we introduce the following quantum fidelity @xmath72 for one - particle reduced density matrix ( rdm ) @xmath73 and @xmath74 : _ q ( , ) ^. [ def : many ] for a quantum state @xmath75 , its one - particle rdm can be explicitly written as _",

    "therefore , before the ehrenfest breakdown @xmath72 essentially captures mean - field characteristics , especially the lyapunov exponent , which distinguishes regular and chaotic mean - field trajectories .",
    "the numerical simulation aims at verifying our theoretical understanding as discussed : for a coherent initial state , at the beginning the mean - field dynamics agrees with the quantum evolution , producing even the same growth of discrepancy between states ; however , long - time exponential growth is not allowed by quantum mechanics , so there exists an ehrenfest time @xmath4 beyond which the mean - field and quantum correspondence fails .",
    "such a failure is due to the decoherence of quantum states ; the breakdown time @xmath4 is given in eq.([eq : timescale ] ) . in the following",
    "we provide numerical evidences for our theortical understanding .",
    "we choose a coherent initial state @xmath82 with one - particle rdm @xmath83 , whose corresponding mean - field state is @xmath84 .",
    "then we slightly perturb the mean - field state into @xmath85 , and generate the corresponding coherent state @xmath86 and rdm @xmath87 .",
    "next we observe the evolution of quantum fidelity between these two states , which allows us to calculate the lyapunov exponent .",
    "of course , @xmath88 and @xmath89 evolve according to the mean - field equations eq.([eq : mf ] ) , @xmath75 and @xmath90 evolve according to the quantum hamiltonian in eq.([eq : hamiltonian ] ) , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are obtained from @xmath75 and @xmath90 , respectively . @xmath93 and @xmath94 are shown in fig.[fig : lyapunov ] ( a ) , where we see that the mean - field fidelity @xmath95 coincides with @xmath96 for small @xmath97 , as expected .",
