    "during last decade the intricate energy spectrum of two - dimensional electrons subject to both periodic potential and a perpendicular magnetic field , has been studied theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the first experimental observation of the splitting of magnetic levels into subbands in an @xmath2-type heterojunction at the presence of a surface superlattice was observed for the first time in@xcite .",
    "the effects of magnetic subbands formation have also been studied in , where the magnetotransport in the structures with a surface superlattice was investigated . however , the analysis of the experimental results was based on theoretical models which do not take into account the effects of an electron spin - orbit coupling .    in a profound paper by thouless , kohmoto , nightingale and den nijs@xcite an explicit formula for the hall conductance of 2d noninteracting electrons in a periodic potential",
    "was derived . as it was found in@xcite ,",
    "such a system has integral values of the hall conductance in units of @xmath3 if the fermi energy lies in a gap between magnetic subbands .",
    "this result has a topological nature and , as it was mentioned in many works , does not depend on the detailed structure of the potential@xcite .",
    "the theoretical studies of the magnetotransport in 2d electron gas in the presence of so coupling demonstrate that in high magnetic field where the integer quantum hall effect is observed , a sufficiently strong rashba constant creates new plateau in the hall resistivity and splits the sdh peaks of @xmath4@xcite .",
    "later@xcite the spin hall conductance of 2d electron gas with rashba so coupling was calculated .",
    "in particular , the resonance increase of spin hall conductance was predicted when two energy levels cross each other at the fermi level .    in our previous work@xcite the harper - hofstadter problem for two - dimensional",
    "so coupled system subject to a periodic potential and perpendicular magnetic field was investigated .",
    "we have analyzed analytically and numerically the magnetic bloch states of 2d electrons subject to both periodic potential of a lateral superlattice and perpendicular magnetic field under the conditions when the so coupling and zeeman term are taken into consideration .",
    "also , the spin density distribution in the elementary cell is obtained and the average spin polarization in a state with given quasimomentum is calculated .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the quantum hall effect in 2d electron gas with so rashba coupling arising from inversion asymmetry subject to both periodic potential of a superlattice and a uniform perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the calculations were carried out for two semiconductor systems with weak and quite strong so interaction .",
    "the zeeman effect for electrons was also taken into account . as was established , the hall conductance quantization rule depends on the system parameters at fixed magnetic flux per unit cell of the superlattice and changes at the moment when the neighboring magnetic subbands touch each other . as we will see below , in the system with a weak so coupling when the so and zeeman splittings are smaller than landau level splitting due to the action of periodic potential the neighboring magnetic subbands are overlapped but not degenerated for any quasimomentum @xmath5 . in that case the hall conductance quantization rule is the same as for spinless particles@xcite .",
    "we found that with the decreasing superlattice period the effect of so coupling rises and the distribution of hall conductances in magnetic subbands is changed at the moment when neighboring subbands touch each other . in semiconductor structures where so coupling as well as zeeman splitting are larger than the splitting by periodic potential",
    ", we found a new distribution law for hall currents of fully occupied magnetic subbands .",
    "all calculations performed in this paper have been made without taking into account the potential disorder .",
    "we assume that , just as in the absence of the spin - orbit coupling , the presence of disorder gives rise to localization of quantum states .",
    "so , the extended states in neighboring landau levels are separated in energy by localized states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to the calculations of energy spectrum and spinor bloch wave functions of an electron in two realistic semiconductor superlattice structures placed in uniform magnetic field .",
    "the position of landau subbands versus the magnetic field and dispersion laws when the number of magnetic flux quanta per unit cell of the superlattice is equal to three flux quanta are evaluated for these semiconductor systems with different strengths of rashba and zeeman interactions . in section",
    "iii we analyse the structure of berry curvatures which are defined in the magnetic brillouin zone ( mbz ) and discuss the numerical results for hall conductance distributions for both cases of weak and strong so coupling .",
    "we consider 2d electron gas with spin - orbit rashba coupling in a potential @xmath6 which is periodic in plane with the period @xmath7 , and in a uniform magnetic field @xmath8 perpendicular to the plane of the electrons .",
    "the correspondent one - electron hamiltonian has the following form : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 @xmath12 is the rashba hamiltonian of an electron in uniform magnetic field . here",
    "@xmath13 are the momentum operator components , @xmath14 is the electron effective mass , @xmath15 are the pauli matrices , @xmath16 is the parameter of the so coupling , @xmath17 is the zeeman factor , and @xmath18 is the bohr magneton .",
    "we use the landau gauge in which the vector potential has the form @xmath19 and consider the potential @xmath20 .",
    "the quantum states structure of the system under consideration depends crucially on the parameter @xmath21 ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 are prime integers ) which is the number of flux quanta per unit cell , and @xmath24 is the flux quanta .",
    "one can express the eigenfunction of hamiltonian ( 1 ) as a set of landau wave functions in the presence of the so coupling .",
    "if we take @xmath25 to be the rational number , the two - component magnetic bloch function , analogous to the one - component magnetic bloch function of the @xmath26th magnetic subband , can be written in the form @xmath27,\\hfill\\llap{(2)}\\cr}\\ ] ] where the spinors @xmath28}$ ] , @xmath29\\cr \\phi_s[\\xi_{\\ell n}]}$ ] and @xmath30\\cr -d_s\\phi_s[\\xi_{\\ell n}]}$ ] correspond to `` @xmath31 '' and `` @xmath32 '' branches of the spectrum of the hamiltonian @xmath33@xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath35 $ ] are the simple harmonic oscillator functions , @xmath36 is the magnetic length , @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the cyclotron frequency . here",
    "quantum numbers @xmath39 characterize the pair of `` @xmath31 '' and `` @xmath32 '' states @xmath40 of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath33 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "note that the spinor wave function ( 2 ) is the eigenfunction of both the hamiltonian ( 1 ) and the operator of magnetic translation and therefore it has to obey the following bloch - peierls conditions @xmath43 where @xmath5 is the quasimomentum defined in the mbz @xmath44 so , here the magnetic brillouin zone is the same as for the charged spinless particle . in the limit of high magnetic fields the functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 are proportional to eigenspinors of pauli operator @xmath47 : @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    substituting eq.(2 ) in the schrdinger equation @xmath50 we come to the infinite system of linear equations for coefficients @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in the case",
    "when periodic potential amplitude and spin - orbit coupling energy have the same order and the inequality @xmath53 takes place the system of linear equations can be reduced to the system of infinite number of uncoupled groups of @xmath54 equations .",
    "each group describes the magnetic bloch states formed from the states with energies @xmath55 and @xmath56 of the single landau level split by so interaction .",
    "the structure of the hamiltonian matrix as well as the matrix elements have been discussed in details in our previous paper@xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that so interaction mixes the states of pure landau levels and results in a doubling of the number of the magnetic subbands formed under the fixed value @xmath25 of magnetic flux quanta per unit cell .",
    "the experimental values of rashba coupling constant @xmath16 for different materials range from about @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "the calculations of quantum states were carried out for two semiconductor structures with different strength of so coupling .",
    "one of them is 2d electron gas in @xmath0 heterojunction with superlattice periodic potential .",
    "this structure is characterized by small so rashba constant @xmath16 and relatively small @xmath17-factor .",
    "the parameters of another system correspond to @xmath59 heterostructure where so coupling parameter and @xmath17-factor have large values .",
    "we have calculated the position of magnetic subbands at different @xmath25 as well as the dispersion laws @xmath60 in magnetic brillouin zone . in figs.1a , 1b the distribution of magnetic subbands versus the number of magnetic flux quanta per unit cell @xmath25 is presented .",
    "the spectrum shown in fig.1a corresponds to the parameters of @xmath0 structure , and magnetic subbands in @xmath59 system are presented in fig.1b .",
    "the magnetic subbands split off the four lowest landau levels are shown in both cases .",
    "the arrows mark the position of energy bands for the value @xmath61 at which the calculations of hall conductance were carried out ( see below ) .",
    "the dispersion laws @xmath60 in mbz are presented in fig.2a , 2b for @xmath61 for parameters @xmath0 and @xmath62 structures , respectively . here and below we consider the magnetic subbands attached to the lowest pair of unperturbed levels @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the system parameters here are the same as in fig1 .",
    "the positions of these six ( @xmath54 ) subbands are pointed out by arrows at fig.1a , 1b .",
    "as one can see from fig.1a and fig.2a the landau level is split off into magnetic subbands due to the periodic potential of the lattice . the splitting caused by the",
    "so coupling and zeeman effect is quite small because of the small rashba constant and lande @xmath17-factor in the @xmath65 .",
    "thus , the spin degeneracy of an electron vanishes and three pairs of overlapped magnetic minibands are formed ( see fig.2a ) .",
    "so , in fig.1a these six subbands are visible as three bands",
    ". it should be noted , that the ratio of the so and zeeman splittings to the level broadening produced by a periodic potential essentially depends on the lattice period @xmath7 .",
    "we calculated also the energy spectrum consisting of six magnetic subbands ( @xmath61 ) for the system @xmath0 with superlattice periods @xmath66 .",
    "it was observed that with the decreasing superlattice period all magnetic subbands become not overlapped .",
    "note also , that at the period @xmath67 the second and the third subbands touch each other and after that all subbands are separated by gaps again .",
    "as we will see below such a reconstruction of energy spectrum leads to the changing of hall conductance quantization laws in fully occupied landau subbands .",
    "in contrast , in @xmath62 structure all of six magnetic subbands are not overlapped due to the large so interaction and zeeman splitting of the unperturbed discrete levels @xmath63 and @xmath64 . as we will see below , the existence of small energy gaps in the spectrum leads to the specific shape of berry curvature which defines the hall conductance quantization law of fully occupied magnetic subbands .",
    "the quantum hall effect in 2d periodic potential has a topological nature .",
    "we have investigated the influence of the spin - orbit coupling on topological invariants ( first chern numbers ) of magnetic subbands , which determine their hall conductance .",
    "when a small electric field is applied , a resulting current in the perpendicular direction to applied electric field may be given by kubo formula .",
    "so , the resulting hall conductance of the occupied magnetic subbands can be written as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a fermi energy and the summation implies the sum over all the states below and above the fermi level .",
    "the indices @xmath70 and @xmath26 label magnetic subbands . at the presence of so coupling the components of velocity operator in @xmath71 and @xmath72 directions @xmath73 and @xmath74 are defined by the expressions : @xmath75 @xmath76    using eq.(3 ) after simple transformations one can write the hall conductance of the @xmath26th fully occupied magnetic subband in the following form : @xmath77\\ , d^2{\\bf k}.\\eqno(5)\\ ] ] in the representation of the hamiltonian @xmath33 the following expression for @xmath78 takes place : @xmath79 . \\eqno(6)\\ ] ] here , the matrix elements of the hamiltonian matrix @xmath80 are defined in our previous paper@xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath81 are the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian matrix @xmath80 ( @xmath82 ) , related to the coefficients @xmath83 and @xmath84 in eq.(2 ) .    in eq.(5 )",
    "the integration is over the occcupied states in the mbz , and the function @xmath85 is the @xmath86-component of the berry curvature whose integral over an area bounded by a path @xmath87 in @xmath5-space is the berry phase @xmath88@xcite .",
    "the @xmath86-component of the berry curvature is defined as usial by the expression@xcite @xmath89 in our case @xmath90 is the periodic part of spinor magnetic bloch function ( 2 ) : @xmath91 .",
    "the first term in square brackets in eq.(5 ) defines the `` ideal '' hall conductance of a single magnetic subband@xcite equals @xmath92 . at the same time due to laughlin arguments@xcite each magnetic subband with its extended states",
    "completely filled contribute whole multiple of @xmath3 to the hall conductance .",
    "so , the integral of @xmath85 over one magnetic brillouin zone divided by @xmath93 is always integer which is the topological chern number .",
    "the semiclassical dynamics of magnetic bloch electrons was investigated by chang and niu@xcite . using the magnetic bloch states they derived the semiclassical equations of electron motion and showed that the berry curvature of magnetic band plays a crucial role in the electron subband dynamics .",
    "namely , it gives electrons an extra velocity in the direction of @xmath94 and defines the hall conductivity quantization law .",
    "we have made a considerable use of these results@xcite .",
    "the shapes of the functions @xmath85 for different magnetic subbands are displayed in figs.3a , 3b for @xmath0 and @xmath1 structures , respectively .",
    "as one can see from the comparison of figs.2a , 2b and figs.3a,3b the maxima of @xmath85 are located in the @xmath5-space along the lines where the gaps between neighbor magnetic subbands are narrow .",
    "the distribution of hall conductance in magnetic subbands for @xmath0 and @xmath1 superlattice structures is shown in fig.4a and fig4b , respectively . here",
    "the magnetic flux through the superlattice elementary cell is equal to three flux quanta . in systems with weak so coupling ( see fig.1a and fig.2a ) when the so and zeeman terms are smaller than the landau level broadening produced by the periodic potential , a quant of the hall current is carried by the middle subband from each group of three subbands ( fig.4a ) .",
    "so , the results of our calculations are in good agreement with thouless et al.@xcite results that in a weak periodic potential and at the absence of spin - orbit and zeeman interactions only the central subband of each landau level carries the hall current when @xmath95 . with the decreasing superlattice period the distribution of hall conductances of magnetic subbands",
    "is changed drastically . as was mentioned above at the critial value of the period @xmath96 the second and the third subbands contact each other and the dispersion laws @xmath60 ( @xmath97 ) are modified . at the same time",
    "the correspondent berry curvatures @xmath85 and , therefore , the topological invariants ( first chern numbers ) of these subbands defining their hall conductance are changed dramatically .",
    "we found that in @xmath0 superlattice structure at @xmath61 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 the following sequence of hall conductances in units of @xmath102 is realized : 0,2,-1,1,0,0 .",
    "as a result , in the system which is characterized by a weak rashba and zeeman coupling constants at the certain lattice parameters the distribution of hall conductances can be totally different from another one distribution predicted for spinless particles@xcite .",
    "if the so and zeeman terms are comparable to the landau level broadening caused by the superlattice periodic potential , the distribution of hall conductance across six subbands measured in units of @xmath103 follows the same sequence as before : 0 , 2 , -1 , 1 , 0 , 0 ( see fig.4b ) . correspondingly , the hall current here is carried by the second , the third , and the fourth magnetic subbands .",
    "moreover , we observed that each time when two bands touch each other while the so or zeeman coupling parameters are varied , the conductances of these subbands may not be conserved when the bands split again .",
    "however , the sum of the hall conductances remains unchanged .",
    "to conclude , we have investigated the hall conductance distributions in 2d superlattice system with rashba spin - orbit coupling at the presence of perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the electron spinor wave function is the eigenfunction of both the hamiltonian and operator of magnetic translation and obeys the bloch - peierls conditions .",
    "the quantum states for the structures with a weak and relatively strong so and zeeman interactions are evaluated .",
    "it was demonstrated that in the case of weak so interaction when the landau level broadening due to a periodic potential is large than rashba and zeeman terms , the overlapped magnetic subbands are grouped into pairs . in the opposite case",
    "all magnetic subbands are resolved and separated by energy gaps .",
    "the hall conductances of magnetic subbands were obtained by integration of the berry curvatures over magnetic brillouin zone .",
    "it was found that in real semiconductor superlattice systems subject in uniform magnetic field at the presence of spin - orbit coupling the distribution of hall conductances in magnetic subbands can differ from another one obtained by thouless et al@xcite in the model of spinless particles . even in the case of relatively weak so coupling and zeeman",
