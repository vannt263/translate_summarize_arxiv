    "over the past decades there has been a significant progress in the study of immersion of 2d surfaces in multidimensional euclidean spaces obtained from @xmath0 models .",
    "the most fruitful approach to this subject has been achieved through the description of these surfaces in terms of the homogeneous variables @xmath3 @xcite and orthogonal projectors @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "using this language , we have established the recurrence relations for the projectors satisfying the @xmath0 model equations , for the wave functions of their spectral problems and consequently the immersion functions of 2d surfaces in the lie algebra @xmath1 . in this paper",
    "we add certain new properties , concerning both the immersion functions and the wave functions , in order to enhance the algebraic and geometric characterization of the studied surfaces .",
    "the surfaces are defined by a contour integral @xcite [ x ] x_k(,|)=i_(-[p_k , p_k]d+[p_k , p_k]d|),k=0, ... ,n - 1 , which is independent of the path of integration @xmath5 according to the dynamics of the orthogonal rank-1 projectors @xmath4 .",
    "the projectors @xmath6 , are successive solutions @xcite of the euler - lagrange ( e - l ) equations in the form of a conservation law @xcite [ cons - law ] [ p , p]+[p , p]= , corresponding to the action integral [ action2 ] dd|=(pp ) with the constraint [ projective ] p^2=p .",
    "equation ensures that the integrand of is an exact differential .",
    "this mapping of an area on a riemann sphere @xmath7 into a set of @xmath1 matrices : @xmath8 is a generalised weierstrass formula for immersion ( gwfi ) of 2d surfaces in the euclidean space @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the target spaces of the projectors @xmath4 are one - dimensional vector functions @xmath10 , constituting an orthogonal basis in @xmath11 @xcite p_k=[1/(f_k^c f_k)]f_kf_k^ , all the projectors may be obtained from the first projector @xmath12 , whose target space is an arbitrary holomorphic vector function @xmath13 , by the recurrence formulae derived in our previous work @xcite .",
    "the projectors are orthogonal to each other and they constitute a partition of unity @xcite [ orthogonal ] p_k",
    "p_l=_klp_k   [ partition ] _ k=0^n-1p_k= , where @xmath14 is the @xmath15-dimensional unit matrix .    for the surfaces corresponding to the projectors @xmath4 ,",
    "the integration may be performed explicitly , with the result @xcite [ xfromp ] x_k =- i(p_k+2_j=0^k-1p_j)+i c_k , c_k=,0kn - 1 . in this paper",
    "we use the inverse formulae for the projectors in terms of the surfaces @xmath16 , obtained in our previous work @xcite [ pk from xk ] p_k = x_k^2 - 2i(c_k-1)x_k - c_k ( c_k-2 ) . to turn the projective property , the partition of unity and the orthogonal property into corresponding properties of the surfaces .",
    "namely , we obtain the minimal polynomials , dimensionality of the spanned subspace of @xmath9 , and the angle between the position vectors of the surfaces , respectively .    in a similar manner",
    "we obtain the inverse formulae for the projectors in terms of the wave functions and the spectral parameter of the spectral problems .",
    "these relations allow us to derive the corresponding relations for the wave functions .",
    "in particular , we determine the minimal polynomial and a linear - dependence equation for those functions .",
    "in order to obtain the relations between surfaces @xmath16 , it is convenient to express them in terms of the orthogonal rank-1 projectors @xmath4 . making use of the expression and the partition of unity in terms of the projectors",
    ", it can be shown that the algebraic condition _",
    "x_k= [ ind ] holds .",
    "this means that the @xmath1-valued immersion functions @xmath17 are linearly dependent .",
    "+ the equation ( [ ind ] ) follows directly from the gwfi ( [ xfromp ] ) in terms of projectors @xmath4 and the decomposition of unity ( [ partition ] ) . indeed , subtracting for neighbouring @xmath18",
    ", we obtain x_k - x_k-1=-i(p_k+p_k-1)+ .",
    "[ im1 ] by adding the equations for every second @xmath18 , we obtain an equation containing the sum of all the projectors @xmath4 , which is the unit matrix , according to .",
    "the final result proves to be exactly eq . .",
    "note that we can obtain the projectors @xmath4 from the surfaces @xmath16 not only as quadratic functions of the surfaces , but also as linear combinations of the surfaces @xmath19 @xcite [ pkx ] p_k = i_j=1^k ( -1)^k - j(x_j - x_j-1)+(-1)^k i x_0 + .",
    "thus we may regain all the projectors @xmath20 from the appropriate linear combinations of the surfaces @xmath21 and the unit matrix .",
    "this means that these surfaces span an @xmath22 dimensional subspace of the @xmath1 lie algebra , as the projectors are linearly independent .",
    "the projective property @xmath23 imposes an algebraic constraint on the surfaces @xmath16 . to find the lowest order constraint on @xmath16",
    ", we compare @xmath24 obtained from multiplied @xmath16 with @xmath24 obtained from multiplied by @xmath4 .",
    "this yields a cubic matrix equation [ 3-deg - cond ] ( x_k - ic_k)[x_k - i(c_k-1)][x_k - i(c_k-2)]=,0<k < n - 1 . for holomorphic @xmath25 and antiholomorphic @xmath26 solutions of the @xmath0 equation ( [ cons - law ] ) the minimal polynomial for the matrix - valued functions @xmath16 is quadratic .",
    "namely , for the surfaces corresponding to the holomorphic solutions we have ( x_0-ic_0)[x_0-i(c_0 - 1)]=,k=0 [ quad ] and , using @xmath27 , we get ( x_n-1+ic_0)[x_n-1+i(c_0 - 1)]=,k = n-1 [ quadr ] for the antiholomorphic ones .",
    "although equation ( [ quadr ] ) is apparently the hermitian conjugate of the equation ( [ quad ] ) , their solutions do not have to be the hermitian conjugates of each other .",
    "condition , as well as two other conditions ( [ quad ] ) and ( [ quadr ] ) , have simple interpretation if we diagonalize them ( which is always possible , as the matrices are anti - hermitian ) .",
    "it follows that the following numbers are eigenvalues of @xmath28 [ eigenvalues ] i c_k , i(c_k-1 ) i(c_k-2 ) , while only the first two are eigenvalues for @xmath29 and only the last two for @xmath30 .",
    "the three values listed in are the only eigenvalues of @xmath16 .",
    "more precisely    * the non - degenerate eigenvalue @xmath31 occurs at every @xmath32 ; the corresponding eigenvector is @xmath3 ( the latter follows directly from and from the fact that @xmath33 are eigenvectors of the projectors @xmath4 with the eigenvalue @xmath34 ) .",
    "* the @xmath18-fold degenerate eigenvalue @xmath35 occurs at every @xmath16 , except for @xmath29 ; the @xmath18 corresponding eigenvectors are @xmath36 .",
    "* the @xmath37-fold degenerate eigenvalue @xmath38 occurs at every @xmath16 , except for @xmath30 ; the corresponding eigenvectors are @xmath39 .    equation , together with ( [ quad ] ) and ( [ quadr ] ) , constitute the lowest degree constraints on the immersion functions @xmath16 of the surfaces ( direct substitution of into the projective property would yield a @xmath40 degree one ) .",
    "although equation is obvious when we look at the source of @xmath16 , it is nevertheless a nontrivial constraint imposed on the surfaces .",
    "since all the eigenvalues are independent of the coordinates @xmath41 , the whole kinematics of a moving frame may only be due to variation of the diagonalizing ( unitary ) matrix .",
    "+ let us now present certain geometrical aspects of surfaces immersed in the @xmath1 lie algebras .",
    "once we have the immersion functions of the surfaces , we can describe their metric and curvature properties .    1 .",
    "let @xmath42 be the metric tensor corresponding to the surface @xmath16 .",
    "its components will be marked with indices outside the parentheses to distinguish them from the index of the surface .",
    "then the diagonal elements of the metric tensor are zero .",
    "this property directly follows from vanishing of @xmath43 and its hermitian conjugate , proven in @xcite [ g11=0 ] + & ( g_k)_11=(x_k , x_k)=([p_k , p_k]c[p_k , p_k])=-(p_kcp_k)=0 , + & ( g_k)_22=(x_k , x_k)=([p_k , p_k]c[p_k , p_k])=-(p_kcp_k)=0 , + where the inner product @xmath44 of the @xmath1 matrices is defined by @xcite [ scalar ] ( a , b)=-(ab ) .",
    "the nonzero off - diagonal element @xmath45 is equal to [ g12 ] ( g_k)_12=-(x_kcx_k)=-([p_k , p_k]c[p_k , p_k])=(p_kcp_k ) .",
    "thus the first fundamental form reduces to [ first ] i_k=(p_kcp_k)dd| .",
    "the second fundamental form [ second ] ii_k=(^2 x_k-(_k)^1_11x_k)d^2 + 2x_k dd|+(^2 x_k-(_k)^2_22x_k)d|^2 , is easy to find when we determine the christoffel symbols @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "these are the only nonzero components of @xmath48 . from equation ,",
    "we get [ chris ] ( _ k)^1_11=,(_k)^2_22=. using and the e - l equations together with , we can write as + ii_k&= -(p_kcp_k)d^2 + 2i[p_k , p_k]dd| + & + ( p_kcp_k)d|^2 . + implementation of the above result for the metric of the surfaces induced by veronese solutions of the e - l equations is presented in detail in @xcite .    also the following @xmath49 order differential conditions hold : @xmath50 equations follow from direct differentiation of .",
    "hence , the mixed derivatives of the matrices @xmath16 coincide and are normal to the surfaces @xcite .",
    "the second order differential constraints ( [ cd2 ] ) are calculated straightforwardly from the definition    & ( x_k,^2 x_k)=-([p_k , p_k])=-(p_kp_k^2 p_kp_k ) + & -(p_kp_k^2p_kp_k)-(p_kp_k p_k^2 p_k)+(p_kp_k p_k^2 p_k)=0 ,    since the conditions p_kp_k p_k = p_k",
    "p_k p_k , p_kp_kp_k = p_kp_k p_k , hold .",
    "similarly , the second relation in ( [ cd2 ] ) holds for its respective hermitian conjugates .",
    "note that equations ( [ cd1 ] ) and ( [ cd2 ] ) are gauge - invariant since they are expressed in terms of the projectors @xmath4 .",
    "we now show that the surfaces @xmath16 , @xmath51 do not have common points for @xmath52 , with the exception of @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the @xmath55 model , where simply @xmath53 coincides with @xmath54 .",
    "indeed , let @xmath56 be two different indices of the surfaces .",
    "subtracting from the analogous expression for @xmath51 , we obtain [ differencex ] -i= multiplying eq . by @xmath4 ,",
    "we obtain [ dif - k ] p_k=. on the other hand , when we multiply both hand sides of by @xmath57 , we get [ dif - l ] p_l-1= [ dif - l-1 ] p_k(1-)= all of the equations ( [ dif - k ] ) , ( [ dif - l ] ) and ( [ dif - l-1 ] ) may only be satisfied when @xmath58 . in that case",
    "yields immediately @xmath59 .",
    "we now show that the immersion functions @xmath60 make a constant angle in the sense of the euclidean inner product , i.e. the angle @xmath61 between the immersion functions @xmath16 and @xmath62 does not depend on the particular choice of projector @xmath12 , nor on the coordinates @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "namely , the angle @xmath61 between two different functions @xmath16 , @xmath62 , @xmath65 , is given by the equation = [ cos ] the formula may be obtained in a straightforward way either by calculating the appropriate scalar product from the gwfi for @xmath16 , @xmath62 ( bearing in mind that the projectors @xmath12 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath4 are mutually orthogonal ) , or by direct operations on the eigenvalues of the immersion functions . in either way we obtain for @xmath68 ( x_k , x_m)=-(1/2)(x_kx_m)=(n/2)c_k(2-c_m ) , while ( x_k , x_k)=-(1/2)(x_kx_k)=(1/2)[nc_k(2-c_k)-1 ] .",
    "it may easily be proven that always yields @xmath69 unless @xmath70 ( and obviously @xmath71 ) , for which the surfaces coincide ( and the cosine is obviously equal to 1 ) .",
    "equation is symmetric with respect to a transformation @xmath72 , which may be seen e.g. in the table of @xmath73 for the @xmath74 model +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + we can regard the immersion functions @xmath16 as position vectors , whose ends draw the two - dimensional surfaces in a @xmath75-dimensional @xmath1 algebra . the above result means that the position vectors make a constant angle with each other , independent of the variables @xmath76 .",
    "moreover , the angle is the same for all choices of the @xmath12 solutions of the e - l equations within a particular @xmath0 model .",
    "the spectral problem is closely related to the immersion functions of the surfaces .",
    "the relation between the wave functions and the immersion functions is given by the sym - tafel ( st ) formula @xcite . the wave functions are also related to the immersion functions by their asymptotic properties .",
    "no wonder that the results of the previous section have their counterparts in corresponding relations between the wave functions .    similarly to the surfaces",
    ", the wave functions of the spectral problem can also be expressed in terms of the projectors .",
    "the spectral problem found by zakharov and mikhailov @xcite reads [ spectral ] _",
    "k=[p_k , p_k]_k , _",
    "k=[p_k , p_k]_k , k=0,1, ",
    ",n-1 , where @xmath77 is the spectral parameter .",
    "an explicit solution of the linear spectral problem ( [ spectral ] ) for which @xmath78 tends to @xmath14 as @xmath79 is given by @xcite [ phifromp ] _",
    "k=+_j=0^k-1p_j - p_k,_k^-1=-_j=0^k-1p_j - p_k , where @xmath80 is purely imaginary and thus @xmath81 .",
    "this in turn yields the projectors @xmath4 in terms of the wave functions @xcite [ pfromphi ] p_k=(1/4 ) .",
    "the projective property of @xmath4 may be represented in terms of @xmath78 as a factorisable @xmath40 degree expression with one double ( squared ) factor p_k^2-p_k=(1/16)_k^-2(-_k)^2=. hence , the minimal polynomials of the matrices @xmath78 are cubic and they satisfy the equation , resembling the corresponding equation for the surfaces @xmath16 , but explicitly depending on the spectral parameter ( -_k)= [ cubic1 ] for @xmath82 .",
    "similarly to the surfaces , , quadratic matrix equations are sufficient for @xmath29 and @xmath30 : the equation with only the first two factors of is satisfied by @xmath83 and that with only the last two factors of by @xmath84 .",
    "the immersion functions @xmath16 may be expressed in terms of the wave functions @xmath78 in two ways : either by the st formula @xcite [ st ] x_k^st=-(1-^2)_k^-1__k or as a limit @xcite x_k = i _ .",
    "[ lim ] using equation ( [ lim ] ) , one can check by explicit calculation that the cubic minimal polynomial ( [ cubic1 ] ) for the wave function @xmath78 coincides with the cubic polynomial ( [ 3-deg - cond ] ) for the immersion function @xmath16 in the limit @xmath85 .",
    "we now show that the partition of unity ( [ partition ] ) for the projectors @xmath4 imposes constraints on the wave functions @xmath78 , given by the relation _",
    "j=0^n-1_j()^j=. indeed , using the wave functions @xmath78 , which can be expressed in terms of the projectors @xmath4 through the formula ( [ phifromp ] ) , for the indices @xmath18 and @xmath86 , we obtain _ k=0^n-1_j=0^k(_j-1-_j)()^k - j= , or equivalently _ j=0^n-1(_j-1-_j)()^n - j-_j=0^n-1(_j-1-_j)= , or ,",

    "in our work we develop the approach proposed in @xcite , which relies on construction of the consecutive surfaces and immersion functions in terms of projectors .",
    "the inverse formulae found in that work allowed for deriving additional properties of the surfaces immersed in the @xmath1 lie algebra and functions immersed in the @xmath94 lie group .",
