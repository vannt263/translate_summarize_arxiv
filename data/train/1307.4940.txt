    "in recent years , increasing interest has been devoted to the behaviour of ultracold atoms in disordered potentials . whereas the first experiments @xcite concentrated on the realization of anderson localization @xcite in one dimension , this intriguing disorder effect  which leads to complete suppression of diffusive transport due to destructive interference  has now also been observed in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "the 3d case is especially interesting since it exhibits a transition from extended to localized single - particle eigenstates : in the absence of interactions , particles with low energy are localized , whereas those with higher energy ( in comparison with the strength of the disorder potential ) propagate diffusively in the random potential . also in the latter case ",
    "on which we concentrate in the present paper ",
    "wave interference effects are relevant , though less pronounced : they lead to weak localization @xcite ( i.e.  reduction of the diffusion constant instead of complete suppression of diffusion ) and , associated with that , coherent backscattering @xcite ( i.e. enhancement of backscattering ) , which has recently been observed also with atomic matter waves @xcite . beyond the scope of @xcite",
    "lies the investigation of the interplay between disorder and interactions , where it is not well understood , especially in the higher - dimensional case , to what extent interaction leads to a loss of coherence , i.e.  to a breakdown of localization effects @xcite .",
    "most theoretical works , e.g.  @xcite , focus on the regime of  or close to  thermal equilibrium and examine , e.g. , the effect of disorder on the condensate fraction , superfluid fraction or the sound velocity @xcite . in this case , weak interactions can usually be treated perturbatively , e.g. , by introducing bogoliubov quasiparticles @xcite .    in contrast , the present paper investigates a stationary scattering setup far from thermal equilibrium . here",
    ", bosonic atoms are continuously emitted from a coherent source ( atom laser  @xcite ) and guided into the random potential until a stationary scattering state is reached .",
    "theoretical studies of this scattering scenario so far either neglect the interparticle interaction @xcite , treat it on the mean - field level @xcite , or apply a hartree - fock - bogoliubov approach @xcite , which is appropriate in the case of a large condensate fraction .",
    "if all atoms enter the scattering region at fixed initial energy , the gross - pitaevski equation obtained within the mean - field approach predicts either a stationary regime with the same final energy for all scattered atoms , or a non - stationary , time - dependent behavior @xcite .",
    "in contrast , according to the microscopic scattering theory developed in the present paper , atoms exchange energy with each other due to mutual collision events , leading to strong depletion of the condensate already for small interactions .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this finally leads to a stationary state with thermal maxwell - boltzmann distribution for those atoms which propagate deeply into the scattering region .",
    "the present paper is devoted to a detailed presentation of the underlying bosonic many - particle scattering theory .",
    "starting from the @xmath0-particle hamiltonian , we derive a nonlinear transport equation for the average particle density .",
    "since this transport equation amounts to a stationary version of the boltzmann equation @xcite , our approach is , in this respect , comparable to previous works on quantum kinetic equations @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these works , however , the additional presence of a disorder potential ( apart from the atom - atom interactions ) in our setup allows us to quantify the regime of validity of the transport equation in a more rigorous way . in the regime of weak disorder ,",
    "the disorder average enables us to neglect correlations between atoms induced by collisions , which in turn is the basic assumption required for reducing a many - particle problem to an effective single - particle description .",
    "moreover  and again in contrast to the above works  we go beyond the case of purely diffusive transport , and also incorporate quantum interference corrections leading to coherent backscattering into our theory .",
    "correspondingly , the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : single ] , we set the stage by reviewing some important aspects of standard scattering theory for a single particle . the case of many interacting particles will be addressed in sec .",
    "[ sec : many ] : starting from the hamiltonian including pairwise atom - atom interaction , we introduce a diagrammatic notation for the transition amplitudes of many particles , from which the scattered flux density can be calculated after taking the trace over the undetected particles .",
    "as we will see , this trace leads to a distinction of atom - atom collisions events into inelastic and elastic collisions , respectively , where the latter are shown to reproduce the mean - field description given by the gross - pitaevskii equation . whereas the methods presented up to sec .",
    "[ sec : many ] are generally valid for an arbitrary scattering potential , we focus on the case of a weak random potential from sec .",
    "[ sec : incoherent ] on .",
    "the assumption of weak disorder ( @xmath1 with wavenumber @xmath2 and disorder scattering mean free path @xmath3 ) is crucial , since it allows to reduce the  in principle infinitely complicated @xcite  hierarchy of many - particle diagrams to a tractable subclass of diagrams , i.e.  ladder and crossed diagrams @xcite , which are composed out of a small number of building blocks .",
    "as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : incoherent ] , the sum of all ladder diagrams amounts to a boltzmann - like equation for diffusive transport eventually leading to complete thermalization due to inelastic atom - atom collisions in case of an infinitely large scattering region . sec .",
    "[ sec : coherent ] is devoted to the derivation of transport equations describing coherent backscattering based on crossed diagrams . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we present the results of numerical solutions of the ladder and crossed transport equations exemplifying the behaviour of diffusive transport for a finitely large scattering region , and the effect of elastic and inelastic atom - atom collisions on coherent backscattering , respectively .",
    "[ sec : concl ] concludes the paper .",
    "several technical aspects are relegated to appendices a - e .",
    "we write the hamiltonian for a single particle in the following form : @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes free propagation and @xmath6 the disorder potential .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath7 of @xmath5 are plane waves with wave vector @xmath8 : @xmath9 and energy @xmath10 where we set @xmath11 .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath6 are given by the fourier transform of the disorder potential @xmath12 : @xmath13 in order to obtain a properly defined scattering scenario , we assume that @xmath12 is non - zero only inside a finite scattering region @xmath14 .",
    "this allows us to define an asymptotically free initial state : @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath16 , which we assume to be a quasi - monochromatic wavepacket , i.e. , sharply peaked around the initial wavevector @xmath17 with energy @xmath18 , see eq .",

    "the operators @xmath26 and @xmath31 fulfill the following versions of the lippmann - schwinger equation : @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the vacuum green s operator : @xmath34 the operator @xmath26 is closely related to the mller operator @xmath35 , as their action on an eigenstate @xmath36 of @xmath5 with energy @xmath37 is identical , i.e. @xmath38 if @xmath39 . since , in the following , we will apply @xmath26 only to such eigenstates  or quasi - eigenstates , as @xmath40 in eq .",

    "we could formulate the following @xmath0-particle scattering theory equally well in terms of the @xmath43-matrix .",
    "however , since the @xmath43-matrix maps incoming onto outgoing asymptotically free states , it does not allow  in contrast to the mller operator  to evaluate what is happening _ inside _ the scattering region , e.g. to calculate the ( quasi-)stationary density or flux of particles inside @xmath49 .",
