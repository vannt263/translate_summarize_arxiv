    "an important feature of the nlc is the high degree of polarization which can be obtained for the electron beams .",
    "beam polarizations exceeding 80%are by now routinely obtained at slac and are steadily improving . at the nlc",
    "a 90%  electron polarization seems a quite sensible assumption . for the positron beam , although there are reasonable hopes that some practicable technology may be available by the time the nlc is operating , at present no scheme for polarizing positrons has been proven to be implementable",
    ".    another fascinating feature of the nlc , is the possibility to run it in its four different modes : , ,  and  @xcite .",
    "in particular the latter collider mode has been shown to have a very high resolving power in searches for a heavy @xmath0  @xcite and studies of its couplings to leptons  @xcite .",
    "this is mainly due to the huge events rates of mller scattering and the possibility of polarizing both beams .",
    "similar studies have also been performed for the more `` bread - and - butter '' muon pair - production reaction of the  mode of the nlc  @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the prospects of bhabha scattering have never been considered in the context of @xmath0 searches .",
    "we consider here the following three reactions involving the exchange of a @xmath0 : [ mm ] & & ^+^- + [ pe ] & & + [ ee ] & &  . in the absence of a @xmath0 ,",
    "their unpolarized cross sections are plotted as a function of the center of mass  energy in fig .",
    "these curves are obtained for a polar acceptance angle of _ ca _ @xmath1 .",
    "the bhabha and mller cross sections exceed those of muon pair - production by more than two orders of magnitude and are thus well suited for precision masurements  @xcite .",
    "as we will demonstrate at hand of this @xmath0 analysis , they are also well adapted to searches for new physics .",
    "there is of course a peak in the  reactions if the center of mass  energy is sufficient to produce the @xmath0 on mass shell .",
    "obviously , close to this pole the  mode can not compete with the  mode .",
    "but if the @xmath0 mass exceeds the nlc center of mass  energy by as little as 20% , the discovery potential of the  mode becomes competitive or even superior  @xcite .",
    "we focus here on the situation where the @xmath0 is far off - shell .",
    "-2em    for each of the reactions ( [ mm][ee ] ) we analyze here the discovery prospects of a heavy @xmath0 and study the the influence of four different sytematic effects :    the polarization error    the angular resolution    the initial state radiation    the luminosity error .",
    "there are many extensions of the standard model   which predict the existence of extra neutral vector bosons @xmath0 .",
    "while most searches are performed within the framework of a particular model  @xcite , it was advocated that it is important to perform a model - independent analysis  @xcite .",
    "otherwise we may miss some unexpected kind of new physics lurking beyond the standard model .",
    "we also adopt this point of view here .",
    "assuming lepton universality , the generic lagrangian describing the interaction of a heavy neutral vector boson @xmath0 with the charged leptons @xmath2 can be written l = e  |_^ ( v_z + a_z_5 ) _",
    "z _ [ lag ]  , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the vector and axial couplings normalized to the charge of the electron @xmath5 .",
    "this interaction mediates both @xmath6 annihilation and @xmath7 scattering .",
    "three unknown parameters are involved here : the @xmath0 mass @xmath8 and its vector @xmath3 and axial @xmath4 couplings . if the @xmath0 is heavy compared to the collider energy , the couplings and the mass",
    "are correlated in such a way that it is difficult to disentangle a large mass from small couplings and _ vice versa_. asymptotically , for @xmath9 , the following scaling law applies v_z,a_z m_z ( s l ) ^14  . [ scale ]",
    "having determined bounds on the couplings for a given energy , luminosity and @xmath0 mass , it is trivial to use this scaling law to determine the corresponding bounds on the couplings for different energies , luminosities and @xmath0 masses .    in the limit we consider here of a heavy @xmath0 , there are thus only two independent parameters we need to deal with .",
    "we therefore express the discovery limits to be set by the three reactions ( [ mm]-[ee ] ) in terms of 95%  confidence exclusion contours in the @xmath10 plane , for a fixed @xmath0 mass .",
    "for completeness , we give here the differential cross sections of the three processes ( [ mm][ee ] ) under consideration .",
    "as we consider the situation where all intermediate bosons are far off - shell @xmath11 , we may neglect the width of the @xmath12 and @xmath0 . in terms of the fine structure constant @xmath13 and the mandelstam variables @xmath14",

    "as the bhabha ( [ pe ] ) and mller ( [ ee ] ) cross sections are large , the systematic errors can easily become far dominant and spoil the advantage provided by the large statistics .",
    "the most dangerous systematic error stems from the luminosity measurement .",
    "however , the dependence on the luminosity cancels out in the angular distributions , _",
    "i.e. _ the differential cross sections normalized to one .",
    "we therefore choose for the processes ( [ pe],[ee ] ) to use normalized numbers of events as observables .",
    "in contrast , muon pair - production ( [ mm ] ) does not have too large cross sections .",
    "moreover , as this reaction proceeds solely via @xmath18-channel exchanges , it is very sensitive to a possible @xmath0 tail",
    ". it is therefore important to keep the information about absolute rates .    for these reasons , we use in our analysis the following two observables : [ abs ] ^+^-  : & & a_i= + [ rel ]  ,  : & & b_i=  , where @xmath19 is the total number of events and @xmath20 is the number of events within one angular bin , labeled by the index @xmath21 .",
    "these numbers of events are obtained by integrating the differential cross sections @xmath22 over the angular range @xmath23 $ ] which corresponds to bin @xmath21 , and by folding over the initial energy spectrum : n_i & = & l _ 0 ^ 1 dy_1 ( y_1 , ) _",

    "we only consider the effect of initial state radiation for the energy spectrum @xmath25 of the initial electrons .",
    "this means that we ignore the effects of beamstrahlung and the beam energy spread after bunch compression .",
    "even though the initial state radiation should be the dominant contribution to the energy spread , this is by no means sufficient .",
    "however , the savings in calculation time are substantial and this should provide a feeling for the importance of these effects . to implement the initial state radiation we use for @xmath25 the kuraev - fadin spectrum  @xcite .    in the linear approximation",
    "the error contours corresponding to 95%  confidence levels are given by the quadratic form in @xmath26 and @xmath27 [ egg ] (  v_z^2   a_z^2   )   w^-1   ( v_z^2 +   + a_z^2 )  =  6  , where the inverse covariance matrix @xmath28 is given by [ cov ] w^-1_ab = _ polarizations   _",
    "i=1^bins 1o_i^2 ( o_i _",
    "a ) ( o_i _ b ) and \\ {    l _ a , b = v_z^2,a_z^2 +   + o_i = a_i , b_i  .    .",
    "for each observable ( [ abs],[rel ] ) the squared errors in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ cov ] ) are given by the quadratic sum of the statistical and systematic errors [ relerr ] -1em a_i^2 & = &  +   _ a ( a_i _ a _ a ) ^2 + [ abserr ] -1em b_i^2 & = & ( 1 - )  +   _ a ( b_i _ a _ a ) ^2  , where the first terms on the right - hand - side are the statistical error .",
    "the second terms include the systematic errors on the bin edges @xmath29 , the polarizations @xmath30 and the integrated luminosity @xmath24 , all added in quadrature .",
    "the systematic errors tend to cancel out for the ratios @xmath31 ( [ rel ] )",
    ". in particular the error on the luminosity cancels out exactly , of course .",
    "it is not a good approximation here , to assume a linear dependence of the observables on the parameters , in this case @xmath26 and @xmath27 . but",
    "this simplication considerably accelerates the time needed for computing the error contours .",
    "moreover , our prime interest here is to evaluate the _ relative _ importance of the different systematic effects , which should not be significantly influenced by this approximation .",
    "we concentrate our numerical analysis on the first stage of the nlc , with a center of mass  energy = 500  .    for the luminosities and their errors we take    l l_e^+e^- = 50 ^-1 +   + l_e^-e^- = 25 ^-1 +   + = 0.5%  .",
    "since in the lep1 experiments the errors on the luminosity measurements are approximately 0.3%   and are dominated by the theoretical error , this choice is quite conservative for the nlc .",
    "the lower luminosity of the  mode is due to the anti - pinching at the interaction point  @xcite .",
    "we do not consider polarized positrons , but we assume for the electron beam polarizations the realistic future values    l p_e^- = 0.9 +   + = 1%  .    for the  processes , there are thus only two combinations of polarizations to sum over in eq .",
    "( [ cov ] ) : @xmath32 and @xmath33 . for mller scattering ,",
    "there are three possibilities : @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we do not consider the third one , since it is not very sensitive to the existence of a @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "if the nlc and lep detectors are comparable , we may assume an angular coverage and resolution of    l || < 0.985 +   + = 10  .    we subdivide this angular range into 10 equal size bins in the cosine of the polar angle .",
    "this number is only dictated by the savings in computation time .",
    "a larger number of bins would only yield better results .",
    "the formal limit of an infinite number of infinitesimal bins is equivalent to a maximum likelihood fit and would yield the cramr - rao bound  @xcite .    finally , to avoid the backgrounds from two - photon processes , for instance",
    ", we demand the total energy of the final state lepton pair to be sufficiently close to the center of mass  energy e_event > - 10  .    -2em",
    "-2ex    we plot for each reaction ( [ mm][ee ] ) in figs  [ fmm][fee ] the @xmath10 contours defined by the quartic form ( [ egg ] ) . in the absence of a signal the parameter areas outside the contours are excluded to better than 95%  confidence . these results are obtained assuming a @xmath0 mass of 2 tev . for other choices",
    "the contours approximately scale according to eq .",
    "( [ scale ] ) .",
    "even with our quite conservative assumptions for the systematic errors , the resolving power of muon pair - production ( [ mm ] ) remains dominated by the statistical errors .",
    "the effect of initial state radiation amounts to an increase by 15% of the lower limit on the observable @xmath0 couplings .",
    "bhabha scattering ( [ pe ] ) suffers a similar loss of resolving power due to initial state radiation .",
    "however , the finite detector angular resolution is now the major source of degradation in accuracy .",
    "this is due to the fact that this reaction is most sensitive to the presence of a @xmath0 in the forward scattering region , where the effect of the angular error is largest .",
    "the dependence on the polarization , though , is not a matter of concern .    -2em",
    "-2ex    mller scattering ( [ ee ] ) is mildly sensitive to all systematic effects . in order of increasing importance",
    "we have the angular resolution , the error on the polarization and the smearing due to initial state radiation . as for muon",
    "pair - production and bhabha scattering , the latter decreases the sensitivity by no more than 15% .    -2em    -2ex    to gauge the discovery potential of the three reactions ( [ mm][ee ] ) we plot their 95%  confidence discovery contours together in fig .  [ fall ] .",
    "these contours include the effects of all four systematic sources of accuracy loss we have considered here .",
    "-2em    -2ex",
    "most current analysis of @xmath0 searches at the nlc are performed for lepton or quark pair - production .",
    "we have considered here the prospects of bhabha and mller scattering and have compared them with muon pair - production .",
    "the three reactions turn out to have a similar discovery potential .",
    "mller scattering is slightly more performant than the two other processes .",
    "all three reactions are relatively insensitive to systematic effects .",
    "the most important degradation of the resolving power is due to the finite angular resolution for bhabha scattering , and to the initial state radiation for mller scattering and muon pair - production .",
    "the lower discovery limits to be set on the leptonic @xmath0 couplings worsens with respect to the case of an ideal beam and detector by about 15% , 41% and 26% for muon pair - production , bhabha scattering and mller scattering respectively .",
    "o perform this study we have used a linear approximation and we have ignored the effects of the beam energy spread and of beamstrahlung .",
    "our results are , therefore , correct only at the qualitative level .",
    "it is unlikely , though , that the full calculation will yield significant departures from these conclusions .",
