    "recent experiments of the neutrino oscillation go into a new phase of precise determination of mixing angles and mass squared differences @xcite , indicating that the tri - bimaximal ( tbm ) mixing for three flavors can be regarded as so - called pmns mixing matrix @xmath4 in the lepton sector  @xcite @xmath5 and @xmath6 is a diagonal matrix of phase for majorana neutrinos .",
    "however , properties related to the leptonic cp violation are completely unknown yet .",
    "the large mixing angles , which may be suggestive of a flavor symmetry , are completely different from the quark mixing ones . in last few years",
    "there have been lots of efforts in searching for models which produce the tbm pattern for the neutrino mixing matrix , and a fascinating way seems to be the use of some discrete non - abelian flavor groups added to the gauge groups of the standard model .",
    "there is a series of models based on the symmetry group @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8 @xcite and more recently @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in addition to the explanation for the smallness of neutrino masses , type - i seesaw model @xcite , in which heavy right - handed singlet majorana neutrinos are introduced , has another appealing feature so - called leptogenesis mechanism for the generation of the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) through the decay of heavy majorana neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "if this bau originated from leptogenesis , then cp symmetry in the leptonic sector must be broken .",
    "so any observation of the leptonic cp violation , or demonstrating that cp is not a good symmetry of the leptons , can strengthen our belief in leptogenesis . for majorana neutrinos",
    "there are two additional phases in @xmath9 , one ( or a combination ) of which in principle can be explored through neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath10 ) decay  @xcite .",
    "although the exact tbm mixing pattern forbids low energy cp violation measurable in neutrino oscillation due to @xmath11 , it may allow cp violation due to the majorana phases .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to explore the existence of cp violation in the lepton sector due to the majorana cp phases in the light of leptogenesis . since @xmath2 depends on the majorana cp phases , we examine if there exists a link between @xmath10 decay and bau .    in the neutrino models with some discrete flavor symmetries , it is worthwhile to examine if leptogenesis can work out while keeping tbm pattern for neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "motivated by this issue , in this letter , we study how leptogenesis can work in a seesaw model with @xmath0 flavor symmetry @xcite .",
    "as anticipated , leptogenesis can not work in seesaw models with exact @xmath12 symmetry mainly due to the fact that the discrete symmetry @xmath0 leads to zero value of @xmath13 and thus could not generate lepton asymmetry .",
    "to make leptogenesis successfully realized , it is essential to break @xmath0 symmetry . in the case that the right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos are hierarchical in mass , successful leptogenesis requires that the rh neutrinos are superheavy , which makes inaccessible to colliders and gives rise to the overproduction of gravitinos during reheating in the supersymmetric scenarios @xcite .",
    "these problems can be avoided if we consider an almost degenerate heavy rh neutrino mass spectrum so that lepton asymmetry can be resonantly generated @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "we especially study how this so - called resonant leptogenesis can be implemented in a seesaw model with @xmath0 flavor symmetry @xcite in this respect , the model has to produce degenerate rh neutrino mass spectrum at the leading order .",
    "the @xmath0 seesaw model relevant to our purpose has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "we examine how resonant leptogenesis can be implemented by introducing a small perturbation in heavy rh neutrino mass matrix @xmath14 while keeping dirac neutrino mass matrix and charged lepton mass matrix unchanged in the model @xcite .",
    "we also show that leptogenesis can be linked to the neutrinoless double beta decay through seesaw mechanism with a small perturbation in @xmath15 .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we study how low energy neutrino oscillation observables are predicted in a supersymmetric seesaw model based on the flavor symmetry group @xmath0 .",
    "we also discuss about the effective neutrino mass associated with neutrinoless double beta decay . in sec .",
    "iii , we examine how successful leptogenesis can be implemented by introducing a soft symmetry breaking term in the heavy rh neutrino mass matrix and show how leptogenesis can be liked to @xmath10 decay .",
    "iv is devoted to our conclusion .",
    "although there have been several proposals to construct lepton mass matrices in the framework of seesaw incorporating @xmath0 symmetry @xcite , in this paper , we consider the model proposed in @xcite , which gives rise to tbm mixing pattern of the lepton mixing matrix @xcite and leads to degenerate heavy rh neutrino mass spectrum which is essential for resonant leptogenesis .",
    "the model is supersymmetric and based on the flavor discrete group @xmath16 , where the three factors play different roles . the reasons , why we consider superymmetry , are to simplify the choice of desirable vacuum alignment , and low scale leptogenesis is well motivated in supersymmetry thanks to the gravitino problem . in general",
    ", there exists a contribution to leptogenesis via scalar right - handed sneutrinos , but their effect depends on soft susy breaking terms . in our study , we do not consider the contribution by simply assuming that the values of the soft susy breaking parameters do not give rise to the contribution to leptogenesis .",
    "the @xmath0 component controls the mixing angles , the auxiliary @xmath17 symmetry guarantees the misalignment in flavor space between the neutrino and the charged lepton mass eigenstates , and the @xmath18 component is crucial to eliminating the unwanted couplings and reproducing the observed mass hierarchy . in this framework",
    "the mass hierarchies are controlled by the spontaneous breakdown of the flavor symmetry instead of the froggatt - nielsen mechanism@xcite .",
    "@xmath0 is the discrete group given by the permutations of four objects and has been studied in literature @xcite , but with different aims and different results .",
    "it is composed by 24 elements , divided into 5 irreducible representations : two singlets , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , one doublet , 2 , and two triplets , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the technical details of the group are shown in @xcite .",
    "the multiplication rules between the various representations are as follows ; @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26,@xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , with @xmath30 .",
    "the matter fields in the lepton sector and the flavons under @xmath31 of the model are assigned as table [ particle content ] .    .[particle content ] representations of the matter fields in the lepton sector and the flavons under @xmath32 . and @xmath33 is the third root of unity , i.e. @xmath34 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     once the initial values of @xmath35 are fixed , the final result of @xmath36 can be obtained by solving a set of flavor dependent boltzmann equations including the decay , inverse decay , and scattering processes as well as the nonperturbative sphaleron interaction . in order to estimate the wash - out effects",
    ", we introduce the parameters @xmath37 which are the wash - out factors due to the inverse decay of the majorana neutrino @xmath38 into the lepton flavor @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath37 is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the partial decay width of @xmath38 into lepton flavor @xmath42 and higgs scalars , @xmath43 with the planck mass @xmath44 gev and the effective number of degrees of freedom @xmath45 is the hubble parameter at temperature @xmath46 , and the equilibrium neutrino mass @xmath47 . from eqs .",
    "( [ ynu ] ) and  ( [ washout01 ] ) we can obtain the washout parameters as follows @xmath48 since we take @xmath49 to be @xmath50 gev , each lepton asymmetry for a single flavor in eq .",
    "( [ leptonasym ] ) is weighted differently by the corresponding washout parameter given by eq .",
    "( [ washout02 ] ) , and appears with different weight in the final formula for the baryon asymmetry  @xcite as follows ;    @xmath51~ ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with wash - out factor @xmath52 as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ leptonasym],[washout02 ] ) , since the lepton asymmetries in @xmath53 and @xmath54 flavors are equal to the first order , satisfying @xmath55 , and the washout factors in @xmath53 and @xmath54 are also equal , the value of baryon asymmetry can be obtained as @xmath56 numerically , the washout factors for normal mass spectrum of neutrino and the inverted one are given as @xmath57 respectively .",
    "thus , taking eqs .",
    "( [ etab],[kappa ] ) into account , @xmath58 is needed to obtain a successful leptogenesis , which in turn means that the value of soft breaking parameter @xmath59 is required for @xmath60 gev .    before going to discuss the value of @xmath61",
    ", we consider the effects of soft breaking term on the light neutrino observables .",
    "the effective neutrino mass matrix is modified due to the soft breaking term and thus it can be diagonalized as @xmath62 with the real eigenvalues @xmath63 and the mixing matrix @xmath64 can be written as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is diagonal matrix of majorana phases defined in eq .",
    "( [ pmns matrix ] ) . note here that , since @xmath67 is real , the majorana cp phases @xmath68 are not affected from the soft breaking .",
    "however , it is obvious that the effects of @xmath67 to the light neutrino mass eigenvalues and the neutrino mixing angles are negligible due to @xmath59 .",
    "as expected , the value of @xmath2 is almost the same as eq .",
    "( [ mee 1 ] ) .    the predictions for @xmath61 as a function of @xmath2 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] where we have used @xmath69 gev , @xmath70 and @xmath71 as inputs .",
    "please note that if there is a mass splitting of majorana neutrinos by a renormalization group equation , the value of @xmath72 can be crucial to have a successful leptogenesis .",
    "however , its value does not affect significantly our results .",
    "so , for simplicity , we take @xmath71 .",
    "the horizontal solid and dashed lines correspond to the central value of the experiment result of bau @xmath73  @xcite and the phenomenologically allowed regions @xmath74 , respectively . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the current observation of @xmath75 can narrowly constrain the value of @xmath2 for the normal hierarchical mass spectrum of light neutrino and inverted one , respectively in the case that the scale of leptogenesis is @xmath76 gev and @xmath67 is small enough . combining the results presented in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and  [ fig2 - 1 ] with those from leptogenesis , we can pin down the majorana cp phase @xmath77 via the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "we have examined how leptogenesis can be implemented in the seesaw model with @xmath0 flavor symmetry which leads to the neutrino tbm mixing matrix and degenerate rh neutrino spectrum . in order for leptogenesis to be viable",
    ", @xmath78 should contain nontrivial imaginary part and the degeneracy of heavy right - handed majorana masses has to be lifted . in our study",
    ", we have shown that flavored resonant leptogenesis can be successfully realized by introducing a tiny soft @xmath0 symmetry breaking term in @xmath15 , which can much lower the seesaw scale .",
    "even though we can lower the seesaw scale down to tev scale , it would be difficult to probe it directly in collider experiments because the couplings between the heavy neutrinos and the light neutrinos are so small in our scenario .",
    "even though such a tiny soft breaking term is essential for leptogenesis , it does not significantly affect the low energy observables .",
    "we have also investigated how the effective neutrino mass @xmath1 associated with @xmath79 decay can be predicted along with the light neutrino mass hierarchies in our scenario for leptogenesis by imposing experimental data of low - energy observables .",
    "interestingly enough , we have found a direct link between leptogenesis and neutrinoless double beta decay characterized by @xmath2 through a high energy cp phase @xmath3 which is correlated with low energy majorana cp phases .",
    "we also have shown that our predictions of @xmath2 for some fixed parameters can be constrained by the current observation of baryon asymmetry in the case that the scale of leptogenesis is @xmath76 gev and @xmath67 is small enough .",
