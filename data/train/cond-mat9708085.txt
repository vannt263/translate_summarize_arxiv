    "interacting systems which tend to form spontaneously periodic structures can exhibit a remarkable variety of complex phenomena when they are driven by an external force over a disordered substrate .",
    "many of these phenomena , which arise from the interplay between elasticity , periodicity , quenched disorder , non linearities and driving , are still poorly understood or even unexplored . for numerous such experimental systems ,",
    "transport experiments are usually a convenient way to probe the physics ( and sometimes the only way when more direct methods - e.g. imaging are not available ) .",
    "it is thus an important and challenging problem to obtain a quantitative description of their driven dynamics .",
    "vortex lattices in type ii superconductors are a prominent example of such systems @xcite .",
    "the motion of the lattice under the action of the lorentz force ( associated to a transport supercurrent ) in the presence of pinning impurities has been studied in many recent experiments @xcite there are other examples of well studied driven systems where quenched disorder is known to be important , such as the two dimensional electron gas in a magnetic field which forms a wigner crystal @xcite moving under an applied voltage , lattices of magnetic bubbles @xcite moving under an applied magnetic field gradient , charge density waves ( cdw ) @xcite or colloids @xcite submitted to an electric field , driven josephson junction arrays @xcite etc .. this problem may also be important in understanding tribology and solid friction phenomena @xcite , surface growth of crystals with quenched bulk or substrate disorder @xcite , domain walls in incommensurate solids @xcite .",
    "one striking property exhibited by all these systems is pinning , i.e the fact that at low temperature there is no macroscopic motion unless the applied force @xmath4 is larger than a threshold critical force @xmath5 .",
    "dynamic properties have thus been studied for some time , quite extensively near the depinning threshold @xcite , but mostly in the context of cdw @xcite or for models based on driven manifolds @xcite and their relation to growth processes @xcite described by the kardar parisi zhang ( kpz ) equation@xcite they are however , far from being fully understood .",
    "in addition , the full problem of a periodic _ lattice _ ( with additional periodicity transverse to the direction of motion ) was not scrutinized until very recently @xcite .",
    "a crucial question in both the dynamics and the statics is whether topological defects in the periodic structure are generated by disorder , temperature and the driving force or their combined effect .",
    "another important issue is to characterize the degree of order ( e.g translational order , or temporal order ) in the structure in presence of quenched disorder . in the absence of topological defects",
    "it is sufficient in the statics to consider only elastic deformations . in the dynamics",
    "this leads to _",
    "elastic flow_. on the other hand , if these defects exist ( e.g unbound dislocation loops ) the _ internal _ periodicity of the structure is lost and one must consider also plastic deformations . in the dynamics",
    "the flow will then not be elastic but turn into _ plastic flow _ with a radically different behaviour .",
    "the _ statics _ of lattices with impurity disorder has been much investigated recently , especially in the context of type ii superconductors .",
    "it was generally agreed that disorder leads to a _ glass phase _",
    "( often called @xcite a _ vortex glass _ ) with many metastable states , diverging barriers between these states @xcite , pinning and loss of translational order . indeed , general arguments @xcite , unchallenged until recently , tended to show that disorder would always favor the presence of dislocations destroying the abrikosov lattice beyond some length scale . in a series of recent works",
    "@xcite , we have obtained a different picture of the _ statics _ of disordered lattices ( including vortex lattices ) and predicted the existence of a new thermodynamic phase , the _",
    "bragg glass_. the bragg glass has the following properties : ( i ) it is topologically ordered ( ii ) relative displacements grow only logarithmically at large scale ( iii ) translational order decays at most algebraically and there are divergent bragg peaks in the structure function in @xmath2 ( i.e quasi long range order survives ) .",
    "( iv ) it is nevertheless a true static glass phase with diverging barriers .",
    "there has been several analytical @xcite and numerical studies @xcite confirming this theory .",
    "the predicted consequences for the phase diagram of superconductors compare well with the most recent experiments @xcite    while some progress towards a consistent theoretical treatment has been made in the statics , it is still further removed in the dynamics .",
    "determining the various phases of driven system is still a widely open question .",
    "evidence based mostly on experiments , numerical simulations and qualitative arguments indicates that quite generally one expects plastic motion for either strong disorder situations , high temperature , or near the depinning threshold in low dimensions ( for cdw see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "indeed there has been a large number of studies on plastic ( defective ) flow @xcite . in the context of superconductors",
    "a @xmath6-@xmath7 phase diagram with regions of elastic flow and regions of plastic flow was observed@xcite .",
    "several experimental effects have been attributed to plastic flow , such as the peak effect @xcite , unusual broadband noise @xcite and fingerprint phenomena in the i - v curve @xcite .",
    "steps in the @xmath8 curve were also observed in ybco near melting in @xcite .",
    "close to the threshold and in strong disorder situations the depinning is observed to proceed through what can be called `` plastic channels '' @xcite between pinned regions .",
    "this type of filamentary flow has been found in @xcite in simulations of 2d ( strong disorder ) thin film geometry ( with @xmath9 ) .",
    "depinning then proceeds via filamentary channels which become increasingly denser .",
    "filamentary flow was proposed as an explanation for the observed sharp dynamical transition observed in moge films @xcite characterized by abrupt steps in the differential resistance .",
    "also , interesting effects of synchronization of the flow in different channels were observed in @xcite . despite the number of experimental and numerical data @xcite",
    "a detailed theoretical understanding of plastic motion remains quite a challenge @xcite .",
    "as in the statics , one is in a better position to describe the elastic flow regime , which is still a difficult problem .",
    "this is the situation on which we will focus in this paper .",
    "though elastic flow in some cases extends to all velocities , a natural idea was to start from the large velocity region and carry perturbation theory in @xmath10 . at large velocity",
    "one may think at first that since the sliding system averages enough over disorder one recovers a simple behavior , in fact much simpler than in the statics .",
    "indeed it was observed experimentally , some time ago in neutron diffraction experiments @xcite , and in more details recently @xcite , that at large velocity the vortex lattice is more translationally ordered than at low velocity .",
    "this tendency to _ dynamical reordering _ has also been seen in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 expansion has been fruitful to compute the corrections to the velocity itself in @xcite .",
    "recently it was extended by koshelev and vinokur in @xcite to compute the vortex displacements @xmath11 induced by disorder and leads to a description in term of an additional effective shaking temperature induced by motion .",
    "this description suggests bounded displacements in the solid and thus a perfect moving crystal at large velocity .",
    "recently we have investigated @xcite the effects of the _ periodicity _ of the moving lattice in the direction transverse to motion , in the same spirit which led to the prediction of the bragg glass in the statics .",
    "it was still an open problem how much of the glassy properties remain once the lattice is set in motion .",
    "we found that , contrarily to the naive expectation , some modes of the disorder are not affected by the motion even at large velocity .",
    "thus , the large @xmath12 expansion of @xcite breaks down and the effects of non linear static disorder persists at all velocities , leading to new physics . as a result",
    "the moving lattice is not a perfect crystal but a _ moving glass_.    the aim of this paper is to provide a detailed description of the moving glass state predicted in @xcite and to present our approach to the general problem of moving lattices .",
    "a brief account of some of the new results contained here ( e.g the @xmath1 renormalization group equations rg and fixed points ) has already appeared in @xcite .",
    "we will use several rg approach at zero and at non zero temperature . since several sections of this paper are rather technical we have chosen to expose all the results about the physics of the moving glass in sections [ sec : structures ] and [ sec : physics ] in a self contained manner , avoiding all technicalities .",
    "the reader can find there the results for the existence of channels ( [ sec : channels ] ) the transverse i - v curves at @xmath1 and the dynamical larkin length ( [ sec : larkin ] ) , the random force and the correlation functions ( [ sec : correlations ] ) the various crossover lengths and the the finite temperature results ( [ sec : temperature ] ) .",
    "decoupling scenarios which distinguish between the moving bragg glass and the moving transverse glass ( [ sec : decoupling ] ) as well as predictions for the dynamical phase diagrams are also given in ( [ sec : diagrams ] ) finally we discuss how the moving glass theory stands presently compared to numerical simulations ( [ sec : numerics ] ) and experiments ( [ sec : experiments ] ) and present some suggestions of further observables which would be interesting to measure .",
    "the following sections are devoted to making progress in an an analytic description of the moving state of interacting particles in a random potential .",
    "since this is a vastly difficult problem , it is potentially dangerous ( and unfruitful ) to try to attack this problem by treating all the effects at the same time ( dislocations , non linearities , thermal effects etc .. ) . already within the simplifying assumption of an elastic flow",
    "two main types of phenomena are missed in a naive large @xmath12 approach .",
    "the first one is a direct consequence of previous works on driven dynamics of cdw and elastic manifolds @xcite .",
    "it is expected on symmetry grounds @xcite that new non linear kpz terms @xmath13 will be generated by motion , an effect which was studied in the driven liquid @xcite .",
    "another important effect , studied so far only within the physics of cdw , is the generation of a static _ random force _ convincingly argued by krug @xcite and explored in @xcite .",
    "if both effects are assumed to occur simultaneously , they may lead to interesting interplays which have been explored only recently and only in simple cdw models @xcite .",
    "however there still no explicit rg derivation of those terms even in cdw models . in the context of driven lattices , there are not even discussed yet .",
    "our aim in this paper is to remedy this situation .",
    "we derive these terms explicitly and show that other linear terms , a priori even more relevant are generated . though these additional linear , non linear and random force terms certainly complicate seriously the problem , focusing exclusively on these terms only obscurs the physics of the present problem . indeed the second and as we show here more important effect in the moving structure is the crucial role of transverse periodicity to describe the dynamics .    a rigorous study of the problem of moving interacting particules would be to first study the fully elastic flow of a lattice . once the main elastic physics is understood a second step is then to allow for topological excitations ( vacancies , interstitials , dislocations ) . in principle the results obtained within the elastic only approach can , as in the statics , be used to check self consistently the stability of the elastic flow itself .",
    "it is hard to see how one can do that in a controlled way without some detailed understanding the elastic flow first ! here we carry most of the first step and propose an effective description of the second .",
    "even the purely elastic model turns out to be difficult to treat when all sources of anisotropies , non linear elasticity , cutoff effects are included .",
    "there are no analogous terms in the statics and thus in that sense the dynamics is more difficult .",
    "our strategy has thus been to simplify the problem in several stages and resort to simplified models .",
    "the simplified models of moving glasses that we have obtained turn out to exhibit some new physics and become interesting in their own .",
    "they call for interesting generalizations to other models exhibiting dissipative glassy behaviour , as we will propose",
    ".    we will call model i the full model of an elastic flow of a lattice containing all the above mentionned relevant linear and non linear terms .",
    "such models can also be written for other elastic structures with related kind of order ( such as liquid crystal order ) .",
    "this model will be discussed in section [ beyond ] .",
    "however its complete study goes beyond the present paper .",
    "fortunately , a useful and further simplified model can be constructed ( model ii ) .",
    "it corresponds to considering the above full elastic model in the continuum limit .",
    "it will certainly give a very good approximation of the full model at least up to some very large scale .",
    "this model was discussed in @xcite and is studied in details here .",
    "it has both longitudinal degrees of freedom ( along the direction of motion ) and transverse ones .",
    "though it is quite difficult , it can be handled by perturbative renormalization group studies , as we will show here .",
    "it has a new and non trivial fixed point which gives a detailed description of the moving bragg glass phase .",
    "it turns out that most of the physics of moving glass is contained in a further simplification of model ii which retains only the transverse degrees of freedom ( displacements ) .",
    "this model , which here we call model iii , was introduced in ref . and is described by the equation of motion : @xmath14 which we call _ the moving glass equation_. @xmath15 is a non linear static pinning force and we have denoted @xmath16 the direction of motion , @xmath17 the transverse direction(s ) and @xmath18 .",
    "the model retains only the transverse displaceemnt @xmath19 .",
    "equation ( [ movglasseq1 ] ) was obtained simply by considering the density modes of the moving structure which are _ uniform in the direction of motion_. indeed , the key point of ref .",
    "is that the transverse physics is to a large extent independent of the details of the behaviour of the structure along the direction of motion .",
    "this is because the transverse density modes , which can be termed smectic modes , see an almost static disorder and thus are the most important one to describe the physics of moving structures with a periodicity in the direction transverse to motion !",
    "let us emphasize that this is explicitly confirmed here by the detailed rg analysis of the properties of model ii .",
    "note that to obtain model iii one sets _ formally _ @xmath20",
    "@xcite .",
    "the hierarchy of models introduced here is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : strategy ] .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "after the sections [ sec : structures ] and [ sec : physics ] where we give a non technical discussion of the physical results , we start in section [ model ] by deriving an equation of motion and , carefully examining its symmetries , we introduce the models i , ii , iii and explain the approximations leading to them . in section [ sec : pert ]",
    "we perform perturbation theory on the full dynamical problem , focusing on model ii . in section [ renormalizationtransverse ]",
    "we use the functional rg to study model iii and thus the transverse physics in @xmath2 and @xmath21 .",
    "we study @xmath1 and @xmath22 . in section",
    "[ dynamicalco ] we study a two dimensional version of the moving glass equation model iii .",
    "this allows to obtain results in @xmath3 at @xmath22 and in @xmath23 .",
    "having obtained a good understanding of the transverse physics in the previous sections , we attack in section [ frgcomplete ] the rg of model ii . finally in section [ beyond ] we examine the full model i , show that linear terms and kpz terms are generated at large scales and discuss some consequences .",
    "all the structures we consider share the same basic features .",
    "the static system in the absence of quenched substrate disorder consists of a network of interacting objects at equilibrium positions @xmath24 , forming either a perfect lattice ( periodic case ) or elastic manifolds ( non periodic case ) .",
    "depending on the system the objects can be either pointlike ( e.g. electrons in a wigner crystal ) or lines ( vortex lines in superconductors ) .",
    "deformations away from equilibrium positions are described by displacements @xmath25 or in a coarse grained description @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the internal coordinate .",
    "a complete characterization of the structure in motion uses three parameters ( i ) the internal dimension @xmath28 ( ii ) the number of components @xmath29 of the displacement field @xmath30 and ( iii ) the embedding space dimension @xmath31 .",
    "two examples are shown in figure  [ lattice ] and more details are given in the appendix . since we are mostly interested here in periodic structures ( though not exclusively ) we can set @xmath32 .",
    "we will consider motion along one direction called @xmath16 , and we parametrize throughout all this paper the space variable @xmath27 as @xmath33 where @xmath16 is one dimension , @xmath17 has a priori @xmath34 dimensions and @xmath35 has @xmath36 dimensions , and the displacements along motion as @xmath37 and transverse to motion as @xmath38 .",
    "three dimensional triangular flux lines lattices driven along a lattice direction thus have @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 where @xmath35 denotes the direction of the magnetic fields .",
    "two dimensional triangular lattices of point vortices have @xmath42 , @xmath18 .",
    "at finite temperatures or in the presence of quenched substrate disorder the structure is deformed .",
    "an important issue is then to characterize the degree of order .",
    "this can be expressed in terms of displacements correlation functions .",
    "the simplest one measures the relative displacements of two points ( e.g two vortices ) separated by a distance @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath43 ^ 2 \\rangle}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 denotes an average over thermal fluctuations and @xmath45 is an average over disorder .",
    "the growth of @xmath46 with distance is a measure of how fast the lattice is distorted . for thermal fluctuations alone in @xmath47",
    ", @xmath46 saturates at finite values , indicating that the lattice is preserved .",
    "intuitively it is obvious that in the presence of disorder @xmath46 , will grow faster and can become unbounded .",
    "@xmath46 can directly be extracted from direct imaging of the lattice , such as performed in decoration experiments of flux lattices .",
    "related to @xmath46 is the structure factor of the lattice , obtained by computing the fourier transform of the density of objects @xmath48 .",
    "the square of the modulus @xmath49 of the fourier transform of the density is measured directly in diffraction ( neutrons , x - rays ) experiments . for a perfect lattice",
    "the diffraction pattern consists of @xmath50-function bragg peaks at the reciprocal vectors .",
    "the shape and width of any single peak around @xmath51 can be fourier transformed to obtain the translational order correlation function given by @xmath52 @xmath53 is therefore a direct measure of the degree of translational order that remains in the system .",
    "three possible cases are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .    for simple gaussian fluctuations ( and isotropic displacements ) @xmath54 but such a relation holds only qualitatively in general ( as a lower bound ) .",
    "depending on how much cristalline order remains in the system the structure factor will have extremely different behaviors as depicted in figure  [ structure ] .",
    "quite surprisingly , if one takes into account correctly the _ periodicity _ of the lattice , a thermodynamic phase _ without dislocations _ was predicted to exist in @xmath2 at weak disorder .",
    "this phase , named the bragg glass , posses quasi long range order with bragg peaks diverging as least as @xmath55 ( with @xmath56 ) , similar to dashed line in fig .",
    "[ structure ] at the same time displacements @xmath57 grow logarithmically at large scale @xcite .",
    "similar predictions hold for other elastic models such as random field xy systems , and a priori also for liquid crystals .",
    "the bragg glass theory has by now received considerable numerical @xcite and analytical confirmations @xcite .",
    "if disorder is increased above a threshold it is predicted that there is a transition at which topological defects proliferate .",
    "they destroy the translational long range order exponentially fast beyond a length @xmath58 leading to finite height diffractions peaks .",
    "the height of the peak will be inversely proportional to the scale at which translational order is destroyed .",
    "this transition is thus characterized by the loss of the divergence in the bragg peaks . in type ii superconductors",
    "it implies that there is a transition , upon increasing the magnetic field @xcite , from the bragg glass ( at low fields ) to another phase .",
    "the high field phase is either the putative vortex glass @xcite or is simply continuously related to the high temperature phase .",
    "these predictions for the phase diagrams of superconductors has received experimental support ( see ref . for a review ) .    what happens when an external force is applied to such a structure ?",
    "one obviously important quantity to determine is the curve of velocity @xmath12 versus the applied force @xmath4 . through this @xmath59 characterics",
    ", three main regimes can be distinguished and are shown on figure  [ regimes ] .    far below the depinning threshold @xmath5 the system moves through thermal activation .",
    "this is the so called creep regime .",
    "since the motion is extremely slow in this regime , it has been analyzed based on the properties of the _ static _ system @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath59 curve crucially depends on whether the static system is in a glass state ( such as the bragg glass ) where the barriers @xmath60 become very large when @xmath61 , or a liquid where barriers remain finite at small @xmath4 , resulting in a linear resistivity .",
    "the general form expected in the creep regime is :    @xmath62    let us emphasize that this `` longitudinal '' @xmath59 characteristics has mainly be used to determine whether the the _ static _ system ( i.e the limit @xmath63 ) is or not in a glass state .",
    "it may not be enough though , if one wants to probe glassiness of the moving system itself .",
    "the second regime , near the depinning transition @xmath64 , has been intensely investigated in similarity with usual critical phenomena ( see e.g @xcite ) where the velocity plays the role of an order parameter .",
    "a particularly important question is that regime is to determine whether plastic rather than elastic motion occurs .",
    "close to the threshold in low dimensions and in strong disorder situations the depinning is observed to proceed through `` plastic channels '' @xcite between pinned regions .",
    "this type of filamentary flow has been found in @xcite in simulations of 2d ( strong disorder ) thin film geometry ( with @xmath9 ) where depinning proceeds via filamentary channels which become increasingly denser .",
    "the third regime is above the depinning threshold @xmath65 this is situation on which we will focus in this paper ( though some of our considerations will have consequences in the other regimes as well ) .",
    "an important phenomenon in this regime is that of _ dynamical reordering_. indeed , it was observed experimentally , some time ago in neutron diffraction experiments @xcite , and in more details recently @xcite , that at _ large velocity _ the vortex lattice is more translationally ordered than at low velocity .",
    "intuitively the idea is that at large velocity @xmath12 , the pinning force on each vortex varies rapidly and disorder should produce little effect .",
    "this phenomenon was also known in the context of cdw @xcite .",
    "the tendency to reorder has also been seen in numerical simulations @xcite .    since the effect of disorder were expected to vanish at high velocity perturbation theory in @xmath10 were developped mainly to compute the @xmath59 characteristics @xcite .",
    "recently it was extended by koshelev and vinokur in @xcite to compute the vortex displacements @xmath11 induced by disorder in the moving lattice and in the moving liquid .",
    "the effect of disorder on the moving liquid was found to be equivalent to _ heating _ to an effective temperature @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "thus the moving liquid was argued to survive at temperatures lower than the melting temperature @xmath68 , and a _ dynamical melting transition _ to occur below @xmath69 from a moving liquid to a moving solid upon increase of the velocity @xcite , when @xmath70 .",
    "these arguments were then extended to describe the moving solid itself , and it was argued that there the effect of pinning could also be described @xcite by some effective shaking temperature @xmath71 defined by the relation @xmath72 .",
    "this suggests bounded displacements in the solid and that at low @xmath7 and above a certain velocity the moving lattice is _ a perfect crystal_. as will be discussed in the remainder of this paper the picture of the moving lattices emerging from the above bold qualitative arguments @xcite goes wrong in several ways .",
    "there are several other important questions to be answered in addition to the @xmath59 characteristics .",
    "the first one is the question of the effect of the motion on the spatial correlations and in particular whether translational order exist in a moving system .",
    "this is related to the question of plastic versus elastic flow .",
    "if plastic flow occurs , the structure factor should signal some destruction of lattice .",
    "however because a moving system is inherently anisotropic new effects may appear and the decay of the structure factor will not be as isotropic as in the static system ( the lorentzian in figure  [ structure ] ) .",
    "this question thus remains to be investigated .",
    "a possibility , suggested by the idea of a shaking temperature @xcite , would be that at large velocity one should observe @xmath50-function bragg peaks characteristic of a crystal a finite temperature .",
    "such questions will be discussed in details in section  [ sec : physics ] . finally determining how motion affects the phase diagram of the statics has to be investigated and depends of course on the above issues . in particular",
    "what remains of the glassy properties of the systems when in motion ( slow relaxation , history dependence , non - linear behaviors ) needs to be addressed .    for moving periodic systems ,",
    "an equivalent question can be asked also about `` temporal order '' and its associated effects such as noise spectrum .",
    "in particular if one looks at a signal at a fixed position in space but as a function of time , one expects a periodic signal with a periodicity of @xmath73 , having @xmath50 peaks in frequency at the multiples of the washboard frequency @xmath74 .",
    "if the lattice becomes imperfect one could naively expect the fourier peaks in frequency to broaden in a way that reflects the loss of translational order .",
    "quite surprisingly this is not so .",
    "indeed it can be shown for a single component displacements field ( cdw ) @xcite that the perfect periodicity in time remains ( in the absence of topological defects ) .",
    "however this result is not readily applicable to a moving lattice , and it is thus crucial to determine whether this remarkable property holds in that case .      to tackle the physics of a structure with a displacement field with _ more than one component _ ( @xmath75 ) , such as a triangular lattice ( by contrast with a single @xmath76 cdw ) , two routes seem to be possible .",
    "the commonly followed one @xcite is to simply borrow from , or extend , the physics of single component cdw @xcite , or of elastic manifolds driven _ perpendicularly _ to their internal direction @xcite . in this case emphasis",
    "is put on the displacements * along * the direction of motion @xmath37 and on the proper way to model its dynamics .",
    "such a problem has turned out to be already quite complicated in particular due to the generation of kpz type non linearities in the equation of motion .",
    "even if degrees of freedom transverse to motion @xmath38 exist as in the cases depicted in figure  [ mancdwgla ] they constitute an extension @xcite of this `` longitudinal '' physics .",
    "thus in this `` cdw paradigm '' it would seem necessary to understand first completely the physics of longitudinal modes @xmath37 and then incorporate @xmath38 as an extra complication .",
    "indeed there were a few attempts to describes the physics of driven vortex lattices along those lines @xcite .",
    "the second approach is based on the realization that the physics of periodic structures driven along one of their internal direction is radically different @xcite from the above descriptions .",
    "this stems from the fact that due to the periodicity in the transverse direction @xmath38 a _ static non linear pinning force _",
    "@xmath77 persists even in a fast moving system .",
    "we want to stress that this is a very general property of a _ any _ moving structure which contains uniform density modes @xmath78 in the direction of motion ( as can be seen on the fourier decomposition of the density @xcite ) . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ mancdwgla ] the substructure formed by these modes can deform elastically in the @xmath38 direction and sees essentially a static disorder . as is obvious from the picture [ mancdwgla ] ( c ) , this substructure has generically a liquid crystal type of ( topological ) order and can be termed a `` smectic '' ( though when @xmath79 , e.g for @xmath2 and @xmath80 , it is rather a `` line crystal '' - see below ) . in all cases",
    "the basic starting point thus involves the * transverse * degrees of freedom as shown on figure  [ mancdwgla ] , and is quite different from the `` cdw description '' .",
    "the equation which capture the main ingredients of such moving systems was derived in ref . .",
    "it leads to a new and interesting model for transverse components @xmath81 , which has the general form in the laboratory frame : @xmath82 since this equation captures glassy features of moving systems we call it _ the moving glass equation_. although it looks like a standard pinning equation the _ convection term _",
    "@xmath83 dissipates even in the static limit ( a reminder that we are looking at a moving system ) and does _ not _ derive from a potential .",
    "thus we will consider this problem and its generalizations as a prototype for a new class of physical phenomena which are glassy and do not derive from a potential ( or from a hamiltonian ) .",
    "the first example is to choose @xmath84 periodic in the @xmath11 direction : @xmath85 and corresponds to lattices ( or to liquid crystals ) driven in a random potential with a short range correlator @xmath86 of range @xmath87 .",
    "the study of this case in ref .",
    "gave the first hint that non potential dynamics can indeed exhibit glassy properties and lead to _ dissipative glasses_. this is a rather delicate notion because the the constant dissipation rate in the system would naturally tend to generate or increase the effective temperature and kill the glassy properties .",
    "however this type of competition between glassy behaviour and dissipation arises in other systems which are a generalization of the above equation .",
    "let us briefly indicate some of the generalizations that we are proposing which are being studied here or in related works .",
    "an interesting generalization is the case of a periodic manifold with _ correlated disorder _ @xcite .",
    "this is relevant to describe the _ moving bose glass _ state of driven vortex lattices in the presence of correlated disorder .",
    "another generalization is to extend the equation ( [ movglasseq2 ] ) to a @xmath88 component vector @xmath89 .",
    "it is easy to see in that case that a non potential non linear disorder is generated if @xmath90 ( which reduces to the `` static random force '' for @xmath91 ) .",
    "thus in that model it is natural to look at a generic non potential disorder @xmath92 from the start .",
    "the mean field dynamical equations for large @xmath88 and the frg equations at any @xmath88 for a large class of such models are derived in section [ renormalizationtransverse ] and in appendix [ parametrization ] .",
    "a subclass of these models is non periodic models ( manifold ) .",
    "they are relevant to describe the random manifold crossover regime in the moving glass ( see below ) .",
    "a further subclass is then obtained by setting @xmath93 .",
    "interestingly the resulting model describes polymers ( and manifolds ) in random flows and can be studied both in the large @xmath88 limit @xcite and using rg @xcite for any @xmath88 .    finally , there are other simpler but interesting situations such as disorder correlated along the direction of motion or lattices moving in a periodic tin roof potential .",
    "these potentials which are independent of @xmath16 have the interesting property that the steady state measure @xmath94 $ ] is _ identical _ ( at any @xmath22 ) to the one with @xmath93 .",
    "thus we see that the moving glass equation hides a whole class of new interesting dissipative models whith glassy properties .",
    "in this section we present all the physical results on the moving glass that we have obtained in ref . and in the present paper .",
    "we deliberately avoid technicalities and refer to the proper sections for details .",
    "one of the most striking property of moving structures described by ( [ movglasseq2 ] ) is that the non linear static force @xmath77 results in the pinning of the transverse displacements @xmath95 into preferred static configurations @xmath96 in the laboratory frame . thus the resulting flow can be described in terms of _ static channels _ where the particles follow each others like beads on a string . in the laboratory frame these channels",
    "are determined by the static disorder and do not fluctuate in time .",
    "they can be visualized in simulations or experiments by simply superposing images at different times .",
    "what makes the problem radically new compared to conventional systems which exhibit pinning is that despite the static nature of these channels there is constant dissipation in the steady state .",
    "this can be seen in the moving frame where each particle , being tied to a given channel ( which is then moving ) must wiggle along @xmath17 and dissipate .",
    "in fact the existence of the channels shows in a transparent way that the wiggling of different particles in the moving frame is highly correlated in space and time , thus leading to a radically different image as the one embodied in the `` shaking temperature '' based on thermal like incoherent motion @xcite .",
    "the channels are thus the easiest paths followed by the particles .",
    "one can see that the `` cost '' of deforming a channel along @xmath17 is that dissipation is increased . thus the channels are determined by a subtle and novel competition between elastic energy , disorder and dissipation . as a consequence these channels are _",
    "rough_. this is a crucial difference between what would be observed for a perfect lattice as illustrated in figure  [ fig : perfect ]    by contrast the channels which are predicted in the moving glass are illustrated in figure  [ chanfig ] and in figure  [ fig : chann3d ] .",
    "it is important to stress that the moving glass equation ( [ movglasseq2 ] ) introduced in @xcite does not assume anything about the coupling of the particle in _ different _ channels but only implies that the channels themselves are elastically coupled along @xmath17 , and thus through compression modes . indeed on specific models such as model ii",
    "one can verify explicitely that although coupling between longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom exists a priori , the longitudinal degrees of freedom @xmath37 do not feed back * at all * in the moving glass equation ( see section  [ frgcomplete ] ) .",
    "the existence of channels naturally leads to several a priori possible regimes for the coupling between particles in different channels .",
    "the first case , represented in fig .",
    "[ chanfig ] ( b ) , is a topologically ordered moving structure corresponding to full elastic coupling between particles in different channels . since , remarkably , this structure retains perfect topological order despite the roughness of the channels , it is reminiscent of the properties of the static bragg glass , and thus we call it a moving bragg glass .",
    "a second case of a moving glass corresponds to decoupling between the channels , by injections of dislocations beyond a certain lengthscale @xmath97 and is called the moving transverse glass .",
    "these two regimes will be discussed in more details in section  [ sec : decoupling ] .",
    "finally note that in @xmath2 channels can be either `` sheets '' ( for line lattices ) or linear ( for point lattices ) as represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : chann3d ] .",
    "it is important to note that the channels in the moving glass are fundamentally different in nature from the one introduced previously @xcite to describe slow plastic motion between pinned islands , as illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ plasticchann ] ) . in the moving glass",
    "they form a manifold of almost parallel lines ( or sheets for vortex lines in @xmath2 ) , elastically coupled along @xmath17 . for that reason we call them generically `` elastic channels '' ( whether or not they are fully coupled or decoupled ) to distinguish them from the `` plastic channels '' ( even though some plastic flow may occur when elastic channels decouple ) .",
    "note that in the above discussion we have concentrated on elastic channels which can _ spatially decouple_. it is possible a priori that they may still remain _ temporally coupled _ , i.e synchronized .",
    "indeed , examples of synchronization where observed even in extremely plastic filamentary flow .",
    "another important property of the moving glass intimately related to the existence of stable channels is the existence of `` transverse barriers '' .",
    "indeed it is natural physically that once the pattern of channels is established the system does not respond in the transverse direction along which it is pinned .",
    "thus we have predicted in ref .",
    "that the response to an additional small external force @xmath98 in the direction transverse to motion vanishes at @xmath1 . a true _ transverse critical force _ @xmath99 exists ( and thus a transverse critical current @xmath100 in superconductors ) for a lattice driven along a principal lattice direction .",
    "the transverse critical force is a rather subtle effect , more so than the usual longitudinal critical force .",
    "it does _ not _ exist for a single particule at @xmath1 moving in a short range correlated random potential .",
    "by contrast even a single particule experiences a non zero longitudinal critical force .",
    "it does not exist either for a single driven vortex line or any manifold driven perpendicular to itself in a pointlike disordered environment .",
    "it would exist however , even for a single particle if the disorder is sufficiently correlated _ along the direction of motion _",
    "( such as a tin roof potential constant along @xmath16 and periodic along @xmath17 ) .",
    "such disorders break the rotational symmetry in a drastic way .",
    "still , in the case of a lattice driven in an uncorrelated potential it does seem to break the rotational symmetry of the problem .",
    "in some sense in the moving glass the transverse topological order which persists ( and the elasticity of the manifold ) provide the necessary correlations ( through a spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry ) .",
    "thus the transverse critical force is a dynamical effect due to barriers preventing the channels to reorient .",
    "we have investigated the equation [ movglasseq2 ] numerically in @xmath3 and found that indeed starting from a random configuration and at zero temperature the field @xmath26 relaxes towards a _ static _",
    "configuration @xmath101 solution of the static equation . applying a small force in the @xmath17 direction ( i.e adding @xmath102 in [ movglasseq2 ] )",
    "yields no response .",
    "the manifold is indeed _",
    "pinned_.    thus we have proposed the moving glass as a new dynamical phase ( a new rg fixed point ) and the transverse critical force as its order parameter at @xmath1 .",
    "the upper critical dimension of this phase is @xmath2 instead of @xmath103 for the static bragg glass . above @xmath2 weak disorder is irrelevant and the moving glass is a moving crystal . for @xmath0 disorder",
    "is relevant in the moving crystal and leads to a breakdown of the @xmath10 expansion of @xcite .",
    "divergences in perturbation theory can be treated using a renormalization group rg procedure ( section [ renormalizationtransverse ] ) .",
    "one indeed finds a new fixed point which confirms the prediction that the moving glass is a new dynamical phase .",
    "using rg and the properties of this new fixed point one can compute various physical quantities ( section [ physicalt0 ] ) .",
    "we find that the transverse critical force is given by : @xmath104 with @xmath105 in @xmath3 , @xmath106 in @xmath2 and @xmath107 is a nonuniversal constant .",
    "the length scale @xmath108 is the _ dynamical larkin length_. it is defined as the length scale along @xmath17 at which perturbation theory breaks down , non analyticity appears in the frg and the ( scale dependent ) mobility vanishes .",
    "before we proceed further let us define now disorder strength parameters . for uncorrelated disorder",
    "the random potential @xmath109 which couples to the density of the structure has short range correlations of range @xmath87 , @xmath110 ( see section [ model ] ) . as in",
    "we denote by @xmath111 ( also denoted @xmath112 , see section [ model ] ) the bare static pinning force correlator @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the average density and @xmath115 the fourier transform of @xmath116 at the reciprocal lattice vectors . throughout @xmath117 will denote the second derivative of the non linear pinning force correlator @xmath118 ( see section [ renormalizationtransverse ] ) .",
    "our result is that in @xmath2 the dynamical larkin length is given by @xmath119 while in @xmath120 it reads @xmath121 with again @xmath105 in @xmath3 and @xmath106 in @xmath2 .",
    "these results are valid for large enough velocities @xmath122 ( see below for the definition of @xmath123 and results for all velocities ) .",
    "note that for @xmath124 the dynamical larkin length depends only on @xmath125 ( and of @xmath126 in @xmath2 ) as it should since the physics of the moving glass is controlled by the compression modes and thus largely independent of the detailed behaviour along @xmath16 .    another way to estimate",
    "the larkin length is to compute the displacements in perturbation theory of the disorder . at very short distance",
    "one can treat the pinning force in ( [ movglasseq2 ] ) to lowest order in @xmath11 .",
    "this gives a model where disorder is described by a _ random force _",
    "@xmath127 independent of @xmath11 whose correlator is @xmath128 .",
    "this regime is the equivalent of the short distance larkin regime for the statics . in the moving glass at very large velocity @xmath129",
    "the displacements along @xmath17 grow as @xmath130 ( at @xmath1 ) with : @xmath131 the scale along @xmath17 at which @xmath38 becomes of order @xmath87 defines the dynamical larkin length @xmath108 , i.e @xmath132 .",
    "the resulting expression coincides with the one obtained within the rg approach ( up to non universal prefactors ) .",
    "similarly one can define a larkin length for transverse pinning along the @xmath16 direction by the condition that @xmath133 .",
    "since what determines this length is only @xmath38 ( and not @xmath37 ) it is independent of the detailed behaviour along @xmath16 .",
    "it is important to note that the moving glass is a very anisotropic object at large scale with a scaling @xmath134 of the internal coordinates .",
    "this implies that at large velocity ( @xmath135 ) the larkin length along @xmath16 is very large ( much larger than @xmath108 ) , with @xmath136 ( one has also the more conventional behaviour @xmath137 in @xmath2 ) . estimating the random force acting on a larkin volume for the transverse displacements @xcite one recovers the above estimate for @xmath138 .",
    "the resulting transverse i - v characteristics at @xmath1 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ivtrans ] .",
    "the transverse depinning is studied in section [ renormalizationtransverse ] and we find the behaviour near the threshold @xmath139 for @xmath140 with @xmath141 to lowest order in @xmath142 .",
    "a reasonable conjecture which would be interesting to verify is that it remains @xmath141 to all orders .",
    "thus it starts linearly with a slope which depends on the velocity @xmath12 .",
    "it is very large for @xmath143 and diverges in the limit @xmath144 .",
    "the existence of a transverse critical force in a moving state raises interesting issues about _",
    "history dependence_. these issues are largely open and should be explored in further numerical , experimental and theoretical work .",
    "let us for instance consider consider two experiments .",
    "in the first one a force @xmath145 is applied to the lattice at time @xmath146 and then wait until a steady state is reached .",
    "the velocity is then @xmath147 . in the second experiment",
    "one first apply a force @xmath148 along the direction @xmath16 , wait for a steady state and then apply @xmath102 along @xmath17 .",
    "one then measures the velocities @xmath149 .",
    "the question is should one find the same result in the two experiments or not .",
    "of course there are subtle issues which complicate the problem and needs to be further investigated ( such as ( i ) the order of the limit system size versus waiting time before deciding a steady state is reached ( ii ) whether the lattice will globally rotate or break into crystallites , ( iii ) some non universality of @xmath1 dynamics ) but one should still be able to find an _ operational _ answer . if it is found that there are such history dependence effects then that would be a strong characteristic of a glassy state ( it should not happen in the liquid where one expects both answers to be the same , but in the same trivial sense as for a single particle ) .",
    "on the other hand , if no clear history dependence is found it has interesting consequences .",
    "we assume in the following that the global orientation of the lattice is unchanged .",
    "then the first consequence is that there is a well defined history - independent global @xmath12-@xmath4 function .",
    "this function however is non analytic in a large region of the @xmath150 plane .",
    "@xmath151 should remain zero at least in the region @xmath152 and similar regions near each of the principal symmetry axis of the crystal .",
    "this is clearly the result of the frg calculation presented here .",
    "but then one may also guess that it may be non analytic too along other lattice directions ( though it is possible that some of the higher symmetry directions be screened by lower ones ) .",
    "the transverse mobility as a function of the angle and the force should exhibit a complex ( and rather strange ) behaviour which would be interesting to investigate further .",
    "a second interesting consequence would be that if in the above described first experiment one chooses a @xmath153 smaller than @xmath154 , the lattice would first glide in the direction of the applied force ( as small time perturbation theory would indicate ) but would soon change its velocity to lock it along a symmetry axis .",
    "it is quite possible that this locking effect exists and be a possible explanation for the behaviour ubiquitously observed in experiments , namely that lattices tend to flow along their principle axis directions .",
    "such a behaviour near depinning was observed in recent decoration experiments @xcite .",
    "another important question for experiments is to determine the transverse critical force as a function of the longitudinal velocity @xmath12 . as @xmath12 decreases @xmath138 increases but it is intuitively clear that @xmath138 can not become larger than the longitudinal critical current ( strictly speaking in the same direction @xmath17 ) .",
    "we will neglect for now the dependence of the longitudinal critical current in the orientation with respect to the lattice ( which gives a numerical factor which can be incorporated ) .",
    "we will call @xmath155 the critical current for @xmath93 . as @xmath12 is decreased below @xmath123 the transverse critical force saturates at @xmath155 .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ gend2 ] ( the large @xmath12 behaviour was given in [ transcrit1],[transcrit2],[transcrit3 ] ) .",
    "there is thus a crossover towards the static isotropic behaviour ( e.g in the bragg glass ) - assuming no dynamical phase transition as @xmath12 decreases which would complicate the analysis .",
    "this crossover can be explicitly estimated using the frg in sections [ renormalizationtransverse ] , [ frgcomplete ] and physical arguments .",
    "it is convenient to discuss it using the figure [ bragg ] ( also useful for studying the crossover in the correlations- see next section ) .",
    "let us first discuss it for simplicity with isotropic elasticity @xmath156 .",
    "there is a crossover length scale @xmath157 below which the moving glass looks very isotropic and very similar to the bragg glass .",
    "this length scale is represented in figure [ bragg ] as a dashed line .",
    "increasing the length scale @xmath158 starting from @xmath159 , at fixed @xmath12 , one is first controlled by the static behaviour until reaching that line ( @xmath160 ) and then one is controlled by the dynamical mg regime for @xmath161 . similarly one can also represent the larkin length at @xmath93 @xmath162 ( in @xmath163 ) . the crossover velocity @xmath123 corresponds to the velocity at which @xmath164 when one has also @xmath165 .",
    "one finds that :    @xmath166    these results are valid when ( @xmath167 ) , i.e. in the collective pinning regime for the statics .",
    "we denote @xmath168 , i.e if @xmath169 one can simply replace @xmath87 by @xmath159 in all the above formulae .",
    "thus for @xmath170 the transverse critical current becomes of order the longitudinal one @xmath171 .",
    "it is useful for purpose of comparison with experiments to compare @xmath172 with @xmath173 .",
    "one finds the general relation :    @xmath174    with logarithmic corrections in @xmath2 , @xmath175 .",
    "this result is remarkable . since for weak",
    "disorder one has usually that @xmath176 it shows that for a system with isotropic elasticity , the transverse critical force should remain of order the longitudinal one up until very far above the longitudinal threshold ( @xmath177 ) ( very high up in the @xmath178-@xmath179 curve in fig .",
    "[ regimes ] ) . as we see",
    "now this is different when @xmath180 .    incorporating @xmath181 , @xmath125 and",
    "@xmath126 one finds that @xmath182 is indeed smaller , with :    @xmath183    up to a logarithmic factor @xmath184 in @xmath2 .",
    "we have used @xmath185 in @xmath2 and @xmath186 in @xmath3 and @xmath187 ( we have assumed @xmath180 and neglected the contribution of compression modes ) .",
    "thus the value of @xmath182 is then much smaller .",
    "one sees from [ probe ] that a measure of the transverse critical current may lead to interesting information about the elasticity of the lattice .",
    "finally note that one can make a simple minded argument showing directly on the equation ( [ movglasseq2 ] ) that the new convective term should not change pinning much at small @xmath12 . indeed starting from the case @xmath93 , where one has a pinned state @xmath188 and treating the convection term as a perturbation ( which should be ok at small scales ) one sees that this terms acts on the @xmath93 pinned state as an additional quenched random force .",
    "since there is a critical force @xmath189 in that case , it is intuitively clear that this term will not destroy completely the state @xmath188 until @xmath190 .",
    "this argument gives back the correct value for @xmath182 .",
    "due to the presence of the static disorder one expects unbounded growth of displacements in the moving glass .",
    "the relative displacements induced by disorder in the moving system can be first computed in naive perturbation theory using ( [ larkinmove2 ] ) .",
    "one finds : @xmath191 where @xmath192 and @xmath193 at large @xmath35 .",
    "thus @xmath16 scales as @xmath194 and the displacements are very anisotropic .    the above formula , if taken seriously , leads to displacements growing unboundedly for @xmath195 .",
    "this is similar to the larkin calculation for the static problem . as in the statics",
    "it indicates that the crystal is unstable to weak disorder in @xmath195 and that perfect tlro is destroyed .",
    "note that due to motion the upper critical dimension is now @xmath2 instead of @xmath103 for the statics . as in the statics ,",
    "the above formula and perturbation theory breaks down above @xmath108 and an rg approach is absolutely necessary to compute the displacements .    using that the rg calculation one finds that the behaviour of displacements is controlled by a new fixed point characteristic of the moving glass phase .",
    "one finds that the correlation function of displacements _ averaged over disorder _ can be rigorously separated into two parts : @xmath196 ^ 2 \\rangle } = b_{\\rm{rf}}(r ) + b_{\\rm{nl}}(r)\\ ] ] where @xmath197 comes from the _ nonlinear part _ of the pinning force . while this part is dominant in the bragg glass ( and was computed in @xcite ) in the moving glass",
    "this contribution is subdominant and we will neglect it for now .",
    "the main contribution comes from the _ static random force _ which is generated both along @xmath17 and @xmath16 direction .",
    "the generation of such a random force , forbidden in a static system , occurs here because of the non potentiality induced by the motion .",
    "the complete expression of the generated random force is given in section [ frgcomplete ] ( see also section [ renormalizationtransverse ] .",
    "this random force gives a contribution to the displacement which at large scale has the same spatial dependence than the one naively extrapolated from larkin regime formula ( [ larkinmove2 ] ) and thus ( [ displ ] ) .",
    "one thus finds : @xmath198 at large scales the random force contribution to @xmath57 dominates .",
    "although the formula resembles the perturbative one , the amplitude of the random force is given by the _",

    "the peaks at vectors with a non zero @xmath218 thus allow to distinguish between the moving bragg glass and the moving transverse glass .",
    "in systems with a small ratio @xmath226 and stronger disorder the peaks with @xmath227 have a tendency to be smaller ( and decoupling becomes easier as @xmath37 becomes larger than @xmath38 ) .",
    "indeed the displacements at large scales ( and thus the decay of tlro ) are controlled by the random forces along @xmath17 , @xmath228 and along @xmath16 , @xmath229 ( they remain uncoupled -see section [ frgcomplete ] ) .",
    "they act differently on @xmath38 and @xmath37 .",
    "indeed , only @xmath230 ( shear , @xmath181 ) and @xmath231 ( compression @xmath125 ) lead to unbounded displacements ( e.g. in @xmath2 ) .",
    "the @xmath17 random force will thus act mainly on @xmath38 via compression , and the @xmath16 random force mainly on @xmath37 via shear .",
    "though generally one has @xmath232 at weak disorder if the ratio @xmath226 is small this could strongly favor the weakening of the @xmath227 peaks and channel decoupling .",
    "thus , the problem of the behavior of dislocations in the moving glass system is of course still open , and constitutes as for the statics one of the most important issues to understand .",
    "it is noteworthy , however , that although these issues are of course important to obtain the structure factors and such , they * do not * affect the physics of the moving glass .      in presence of correlated disorder along the @xmath35 direction",
    "we predict the existence of a `` moving bose glass '' in @xmath2 .",
    "indeed the same calculation as above :    @xmath233    now yields a fast growing displacement .",
    "thus the disorder effects are stronger and one can expect thermal effects to be weaker for correlated disorder . the situation resembles the @xmath3 case at @xmath1 .",
    "one can still predict a transverse critical current .",
    "full translational lro is unlikely but a moving transverse glass type of order along @xmath17 is likely",
    ". this should be enough to guarantee a localization effect of the layers and thus a transverse meissner effect along @xmath17 .",
    "a detailed study will be given in @xcite .",
    "the effect of correlated disorder on another dissipative glass system ( nonpotential ) were found to be quite strong in @xcite .",
    "thus the moving glasses , in its different forms , described by equation ( [ movglasseq2 ] ) is a new disordered fixed point at @xmath1 .",
    "an important question is to understand what is the effect of thermal fluctuations .    indeed in moving systems ,",
    "as can be seen by perturbation theory , the fluctuation dissipation theorem is violated and a generation of temperature by motion will occur .",
    "this corresponds to the physical effect of heating by motion .",
    "note however that this effect is different from the `` shaking temperature '' effect @xcite which would occur even at @xmath1 .",
    "indeed at @xmath1 a system in the absence of thermal fluctuations retains perfect time order which implies that no temperature can be generated !    although the temperature will grow due to motion , this effect competes with the fact that naive power counting in glassy systems suggests that the temperature is an irrelevant variable flowing to zero .",
    "the competition between these two effects is highly non trivial and leads to new physics which needs to be investigated for the whole class of moving glasses of section  [ sec : themg ] .",
    "remarkably , for this class of systems , new finite temperature fixed points exists . in the case of driven lattices",
    ", we find a fixed point at finite temperature in a @xmath21 expansion and @xmath23 expansion .",
    "similarly for randomly driven polymers very similar fixed points are obtained @xcite .",
    "thus a large class of moving glasses seems to exist at non zero temperature .    in @xmath2 ,",
    "the fixed point is slightly peculiar since both temperature and disorder flow to zero but can be analyzed along the same lines .",
    "the properties of the finite temperature phase are continously related to the @xmath1 one . in particular the finite temperature moving glass exhibits the same type of rough channel structure .",
    "channels are slightly broadened due to bounded thermal displacements around the average channel position .",
    "thus the asymptotic behavior the displacements , and structure factor , still remains similar to the ones at @xmath1 discussed in previous sections .",
    "there is in addition a contribution of thermal displacements . in @xmath2",
    "they are small , and one sees that the rg methods developped here allow to estimate more precisely the thermal heating effect , and to distinguish it clearly from the disorder effects",
    ". this will be important for determining the dynamical phase diagrams . in @xmath3",
    "the thermal displacements are large ( see section [ dynamicalco ] ) .",
    "the main effect of temperature is to modify the @xmath59 characteristics .",
    "one finds ( section [ renormalizationtransverse ] ) that the asymptotic mobility @xmath234 is non zero .",
    "however at low temperatures or at velocities not too large the @xmath59 characteristics remains highly non linear .",
    "there is still an `` effective '' ( or apparent ) transverse critical force @xmath235 as shown on figure  [ gend2 ] . at low temperature",
    "the mobility @xmath234 is very small .",
    "if the velocity is not too large @xmath236 there are several regions in the @xmath12-@xmath4 curve . below the transverse pinning force slow motion due to effective barriers exist .",
    "they are a growing function of @xmath237 until one reaches the finite temperature moving glass fixed point . indeed reducing the transverse force probes larger and larger lengthscales .",
    "as depicted in figure  [ bragg ] one is dominated until the scale @xmath238 by the bragg glass fixed point for which temperature is strongly renormalized downwards . in this regime",
    "the @xmath59 curve are nearly similar to the one in the static bragg glass and thus highly non - linear .",
    "this corresponds to a creep regime . for smaller forces",
    "( i.e. when probing scales larger than @xmath238 ) one crosses over to the moving bragg glass fixed point . at that point",
    "the frg calculation shows that the barriers saturate . thus below the scale @xmath239 one",
    "recovers a linear @xmath59 charactersitics , with an extremely small mobility .",
    "note that the scale @xmath239 which corresponds to the crossover scale @xmath238 can be much smaller than the critical transverse pinning force if @xmath236 .",
    "these properties shows that even at finite temperature the moving bragg glass remains different from a perfect crystal .",
    "the definition of what is `` glassiness '' in a moving structure is a new concept which has to be defined . in that respect too close analogies with the statics",
    "can be misleading .",
    "a first obvious glassy characteristics is the loss of translational order , contrarily to the crystal .",
    "note however that a similar effect could be obtained by adding a random force by hand to a perfect crystal .",
    "however the response of such a structure to an externaly applied force would be * identical * to the one of a perfect crystal .",
    "thus the glassy properties of the moving bragg glass are necessarily stronger than such a state",
    ". the same question of history dependence as discussed above at @xmath1 can be asked .",
    "if these effects exist the question of the finiteness of the barriers might not be as an important issue as in the static case .",
    "note however that in some other examples of non potential dynamics barriers can indeed be infinite @xcite    since the finite temperature moving bragg glass is described by a new fixed point which still contains non - linear disorder @xmath240 the system remains obviously in a glassy regime .",
    "some correlation functions of the system will necessary depend on the existence of this finite @xmath240 .",
    "this is reminiscent of what happens in the statics where the order parameter is the fluctuation of the susceptibility @xcite whereas the averaged susceptibility itself remain inocuous .",
    "note finally that for driven lattice ( and for experimetal purposes ) , the predicted existence of high ( even if asymptotically finite ) barriers in some regime of velocities is a totally un - anticipated property of disordered moving systems .      having established the existence of the moving bragg glass in @xmath2 and of the moving transverse glass in @xmath2 and @xmath3 and discussed their properties we now indicate in which region of the phase diagram these phases are expected to exist .",
    "we study the phase diagram as a function of disorder , temperature and applied force ( or velocity ) .",
    "let us first discuss the case @xmath2 .",
    "we have represented in figure  [ gend3 ] a schematic expected phase diagram in the three axis . for clarity",
    "we have not represented intermediate phases .",
    "the static phase diagram at @xmath241 was dicussed in .",
    "there is a transition at finite disorder strenght between the bragg glass to an amorphous glass where dislocations proliferate . upon applying a force",
    "the bragg glass phase becomes the moving bragg glass in the low velocity regime ( creep regime ) and continuously extend to the moving bragg glass at higher drives . at weak enough disorder",
    "the continuity between the two phases suggests that depinning should be elastic without an intermediate plastic region . upon raising the temperature",
    "the moving bragg glass melts to a liquid , presumably through a first order dynamical melting transition .",
    "the @xmath1 plane contains a pinned region for @xmath242 it is natural to expect the bragg glass to still exist even for a finite force @xmath243 until the depinning transition . at higher disorder dislocations",
    "appear and the bragg glass is replaced by an amorphous glass .",
    "the depinning of this amorphous glass should be via a highly disordered filamentary plastic flow .",
    "upon increasing the force and thus the velocity , the system should reverse back to the moving bragg glass . at strong disorder and finite drive",
    "the liquid extends to zero temperature .",
    "this different behaviors are also represented along each plane in figure  [ fig : delf],[fig : delt],[fig : ft ] , where we have also indicated intermediate phases such as the moving transverse glass .",
    "determining the exact shape of the various boundaries is still an open and challenging problem , in particular in the square regions in fig .",
    "[ gend3 ]    one of the strong features that emerges from this phase diagrams is the fact that the bragg glass is able to survive motion by turning into the moving bragg glass . on the other hand",
    "other , more disordered phases such as the amorphous glass ( vortex glass ) are likely to be immediately destroyed at finite drive ( and finite temperature ) and to be continuously related to the liquid .    in d=2 , most of the transitions reduce to simple crossover . at @xmath241 and",
    "finite disorder dislocations are expected to be present .",
    "the resulting phase should thus be continuously connected to the liquid , although it can retain good short distance translational order . at @xmath1",
    "there is a pinned phase until @xmath244 , which should depin by a plastic flow . at larger drive disorder effects",
    "become smaller and one expects the system to revert to a moving glass state .",
    "as discussed earlier , due to the presence of disorder induced dislocations , this state is a moving transverse glass ( if @xmath3 is above its lower critical dimension ) . at any finite temperature",
    ", one can use the rg flow of section  [ dynamicalco ] .",
    "since the temperature renormalizes _ above _ the melting temperature and disorder flows to zero the resulting phase should be a driven liquid .",
    "some of the predictions of the moving glass theory contained in the short account of our work @xcite have been later verified in several numerical simulations in @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "the static channels were clearly observed at @xmath1 in @xmath3 @xcite . they were also observed in ref . .",
    "the transverse critical force at @xmath1 in @xmath3 was observed very clearly in @xcite and in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and found to be a fraction of the longitudinal critical force which is a reasonable order of magnitude .",
    "the effect of a non zero temperature @xmath22 was observed to weaken the effect of transverse barriers in @xcite in @xmath3 .",
    "note that some non linear effects were observed to persist for low enough transverse force and temperature .",
    "such an observation is in agreement in the discussion of section ( ) and can be interpreted as a long crossover .",
    "sharp bragg peaks were observed in the direction transverse to motion in @xcite at @xmath1 . however the order along the @xmath16 direction was found to have fast decay .",
    "this is consistent with a decoupling of the channels , and the resulting state was termed the `` moving transverse glass '' .",
    "this is consistent with the expectations from the theory presented here , as illustrated on the phase diagram ( [ fig:2d ] ) .",
    "this phase is presumably the @xmath1 moving transverse glass fixed point analyzed in section ( ) which does have a non zero transverse critical force .",
    "this is in fact confirmed by the observation of @xcite of a smectic type of order where well separated dislocations exist between the channels consistent with the expectations discussed in section ( ) .",
    "the absence of long range order was also observed in @xcite in a stronger disorder situation .    in @xmath2 , a simulation of a driven discrete superconducting xy gauge model",
    "@xcite finds not perfect but still well defined bragg peaks at @xmath22 ( near the melting ) , a result which indicates that the driven lattice is in a quasi ordered moving bragg glass state . in another study on the simpler",
    "@xmath2 driven xy model at @xmath1 @xcite , it was found that indeed there is a phase without topological defects at large enough drive .",
    "if it carries to the lattice problem it would indicate that indeed there is a @xmath2 moving bragg glass state .",
    "finally note that there are also very recent simulations of a lattice with a periodic substrate @xcite .",
    "this is a simpler case where a transverse critical current exist ( it does exist for a single particule )",
    ". it may be worthile to investigate this case in all details .",
    "all the above numerically observed effects seem to be in qualitative agreement with the predictions in @xcite",
    ". however , it would be very useful to be able to make a more _ quantitative _ comparison .",
    "this should now be possible , as we will give here more detailed predictions than the short account @xcite . among the various interetsing topics to check are the algebraic decay of translational order in @xmath2 , a detailed study of the dependence of the transverse critical force on the velocity , the exponent @xmath245 of the transverse depinning , a measure of the barriers at low temperatures , a characterization of the history dependence , and zero and at low temperature .",
    "the moving glass picture has also been confronted with experiments . since these experiments need the characterization of a moving structure they are challenging .",
    "the transverse critical current can in principle be observed in transport experiments ( and will show up as hysteretic effects ) .",
    "these are difficult though because of dissipation in the longitudinal direction .",
    "decoration experiments on the _ moving _ vortex lattice have been performed recently by marchevsky et al .",
    "@xcite . in these experiments the external field",
    "is slowly varied and vortices are decorated while they move .",
    "the decoration particles thus accumulate on the regions where vortices are flowing preferentially .",
    "the lattice is observed to move in the symmetry axis direction and relatively large regions of highly correlated static channels are observed .",
    "these channels do not look like `` plastic channels '' but rather like the channels predicted in @xcite .",
    "note however that some dislocations along @xmath17 appear ( defects in the layered structure ) .",
    "this may be due to strong disorder effects or since the advancing front geometry is in the shape of a droplet some dislocations are unavoidable .",
    "another set of experiments in nbse2 was also reported in @xcite .",
    "note that there has also been several decoration experiments performed _ just after _ the current is turned off .",
    "these can in principle probe the defect structure of the flowing lattice ( though one may worry about transient effects ) but can not show the channel structure .    in @xcite we have suggested that the transverse barriers may explain the anomalies recently observed in the hall effect in a wigner crystal in a constant magnetic field @xcite .    the qualitative analysis suggested by the moving glass theory is as follows .",
    "an electric field @xmath246 is applied in along the @xmath16 direction .",
    "the wigner crystal starts moving along @xmath16 when the applied field is larger than a `` longitudinal '' threshold @xmath247 .",
    "it produces a current along @xmath16 , @xmath248 which is directly measured . below the longitudinal threshold a highly non linear regime",
    "is observed where activated motion dominate .",
    "since it is moving in a high magnetic field , the moving wigner crystal is submitted to a transverse lorentz force @xmath249 .",
    "the geometry of the experiment is such , however , that no transverse motion is permitted in the stationary state ( because of zero current boundary conditions ) , and thus @xmath250 .",
    "thus the transverse lorentz force must be balanced by a transverse electric field , which is thus generated , and is measured as the hall voltage @xmath251 . in the absence of transverse pinning the hall voltage is @xmath252 .",
    "remarkably , it is found in the experiment that the actual measured hall voltage is indeed @xmath252 for small @xmath253 , then experiences a plateau , and finally starts again growing linearly with a slope @xmath254 .",
    "we have interpreted the different behaviours upon increase of @xmath253 as follows . for small @xmath253",
    "one is near the longitudinal depinning and it is probably a plastic flow regime with little transverse barriers",
    ". then upon motion , a transition to a moving solid occurs , which is presumably a moving glass .",
    "the existence of a non zero transverse critical force @xmath255 then immediately implies that there are sliding states with @xmath256 as long as @xmath257 and no hall voltage necessary .",
    "finally note a recent experiment @xcite on superconducting multilayers where it was found that the flux flow resistivity exhibit quasi periodic oscillations as a function of the field .",
    "this was interpreted @xcite in terms of dynamics matching of the moving vortex lattice with the periodic substrate .",
    "this is compatible with the presence of a quasi ordered structure in motion .",
    "it would be interesting to probe further the channel structure by direct imaging techniques .",
    "in particular one may investigate the degree of reproducibility of the channel pattern .",
    "it is predicted that upon sudden reversal of the velocity the channels should be _",
    "different_. the question of order and quasi order can be probed in experiments such as neutron scattering , flux lattice imaging magnetic noise experiments , nmr experiments and more indirectly in transport measurements .",
    "other imaging techniques such as @xmath258-sr nmr electron holography can also be used .",
    "finally it would be interesting to check for similar effects in the presence of columnar defects since , as discussed in this paper we predict the formation of a moving bose glass .",
    "let us first derive the equation of motion for a lattice submitted to external force @xmath4 .",
    "we work in the _ laboratory frame_. this offers several advantages that will become obvious later .",
    "we denote by @xmath259 the true position of an individual vortex in the laboratory frame .",
    "the lattice as a whole moves with a velocity @xmath12 .",
    "we thus introduce the displacements @xmath260 where the @xmath24 denote the equilibrium positions in the perfect lattice with no disorder . @xmath25 represent the displacements compared to a moving perfect lattice ( and corresponds to the position of the i - th particle in the moving frame ) .",
    "the definition of @xmath12 imposes @xmath261 at all times .",
    "we furthermore assume that the motion is overdamped .",
    "the exact equation of motion can then be obtained from the hamiltonian @xmath6 by @xmath262 where @xmath263 is the friction coefficient and the thermal noise satisfies @xmath264 .",
    "the hamiltonian is the standard hamiltonian for periodic structure in a random potential @xmath265 .",
    "@xmath266 is the standard elastic hamiltonian , and @xmath267 describes the interaction with the random potential @xmath268 where the random potential has correlations @xmath269 of range @xmath87 .    in order to use the standard field description of the displacement @xmath11 instead of focussing on the equation for one particle , one rewrites ( [ labase ] ) as @xmath270 in doing so one would get the same thermal noise for two particles being at the same place at the same time , instead of the two independent noises of equation ( [ labase ] ) . since such a configuration can not happen , going from ( [ labase ] ) to ( [ labasem ] ) is essentially exact .    as for the static case @xcite",
    "the difficulty is to take the continuum limit of ( [ labasem ] ) since the disorder can vary at a much shorter scale than the lattice spacing @xmath159 . to proceed one follows the same steps than for the static case , suitably modified to take into account the time dependence of the displacements .",
    "one first introduces a smooth interpolating displacement field @xmath26 such that @xmath271 ( see formula @xmath272 of ) .",
    "the field @xmath26 is the smoothest field interpolating between the actual positions @xmath273 .",
    "all coordinates @xmath27 are expressed in the laboratory frame .",
    "the field @xmath26 , whose components we denote by @xmath274 thus expresses the displacement in the moving frame , as a function of the coordinates of the laboratory frame .    as for the static ,",
    "if one assumes the absence of dislocations at all times the particles can be labeled in a unique way .",
    "one then introduces the continuous labelling field : @xmath275\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus @xmath276 by definition , and @xmath277 numbers the particles by their initial positions . in the absence of dislocations",
    "the field @xmath278 is uniquely defined .    to obtain the continuum limit of the equation ( [ labasem ] )",
    "one first performs the continuum limit in the hamiltonian as in , to obtain for the disorder term @xmath279 where @xmath51 spans the reciprocal lattice and @xmath280 is the average density .    in ( [ couplage ] ) we have made the approximation @xmath281 such an approximation is exact up to higher powers of @xmath282 , negligeable in the elastic limit , as for the static case @xcite .",
    "however the dynamic case is more subtle since such terms could generate when combined with a non - zero velocity relevant terms .",
    "this is the case for example of the so - called kpz terms generated through cutoff effects .",
    "since it is hopeless to try to tackle from first principle all such additional terms the only safe procedure is to assume that every term allowed by symetry will be generated , and has to be examined .",
    "we will proceed with such a program in section  [ beyond ] . for the moment we only retain the dominant terms of ( [ couplage ] ) . if one then takes the derivative with respect to the smooth field @xmath26 one obtains for the equation of motion in the laboratory frame @xmath283 where @xmath284 is the elastic matrix .",
    "the term @xmath285 comes from the standard euler representation when expressing the displacement field in the laboratory frame .",
    "@xmath286 is the average friction and in the continuum @xmath12 is determined by the condition that the average of @xmath11 is zero .",
    "the thermal noise satisfies in the continuum limit @xmath287 and @xmath288 is the pinning force .",
    "note the difference between our equation ( [ eqmotion ] ) and the one derived in , which does not contain the convective term .",
    "this difference comes simply from a different definition of the displacement fields .",
    "they consider displacements fields labelled by the original position of the particle ( i.e. the actual position of the particle is @xmath289 ) whereas for us @xmath27 denotes the actual position of the vortex considered ( i.e. in the presence of an external potential @xmath290 the potential acting on the vortex at point @xmath27 is @xmath109 instead of @xmath291 for ) .    in appendix  [ nonham ]",
    "we give a more general derivation of ( [ pinham ] ) valid even for cases where the equation of motion is _ not _ the derivative of a potential .",
    "before we even attempt to solve ( [ eqmotion ] ) , let us examine the various symmetries of the problem and define several models which approximate the physical problem at various levels .",
    "the physical symmetry of the original equation of motion ( [ labase ] ) is the global inversion symmetry ( @xmath292 , @xmath293 , @xmath294 @xmath295 ) . when the force ( and thus @xmath12 ) is along a principal lattice direction , one has then two independent inversion symmetries @xmath296 ( @xmath297 , @xmath298 , @xmath294 @xmath295 ) and @xmath299 ( @xmath300 , @xmath301 ) .",
    "these symmetries are exact and hold in all cases .",
    "they are the only symmetries of the original model ( [ labase ] ) . the proper continuum limit of equation ( [ labase ] ) must thus include all terms which are relevant and consistent with these exact symmetries .",
    "we define such a model as model i , which will be studied in more details in section ( [ beyond ] ) .",
    "the additional terms can originate from e.g anharmonic elasticity , cutoff effects or higher order terms in @xmath302 , as will be dicussed in section  [ beyond ] .",
    "if one drop in model i the terms which are small in the elastic limit @xmath303 , one obtains another model that we call model ii .",
    "it corresponds to the continuum limit of the equation of motion to obtain equation ( [ eqmotion ] ) i.e. ( [ eqmotion ] ) in the elastic limit .",
    "although model ii is slightly simpler than model i , it only misses terms which are small in the bare equation but would be allowed by the above symmetries .",
    "even if some of them are relevant , the would only be able to change the physics compared to model ii at very large length scales .",
    "one thus expects model ii to give in practice an extremely accurate description of the physics .",
    "the model ii posesses a higher symmetry than model i : let us examine the symmetries of the pinning force ( [ pinham ] ) . using the correlator of the random potential @xmath290 ,",
    "the correlator of the pinning force is : @xmath304 since @xmath11 is a smooth field it has no rapidly oscillating components and thus in ( [ eq1 ] ) the terms that are rapidly oscillating in @xmath305 can be discarded . setting @xmath306 in ( [ eq1 ] ) ,",
    "one is left with @xmath307 the symmetries of ( [ copinfor ] ) thus a priori depends on the precise form of the correlator @xmath116 .",
    "however in the elastic limit it is legitimate to replace @xmath308 by @xmath309 in the above expression .",
    "integrating then over @xmath310 one obtains : @xmath311 where @xmath115 is the fourier coefficient of the correlator @xmath116 .",
    "since @xmath115 is essentially zero for @xmath312 , the error made in the above approximation is itself of order @xmath302 and thus consistent with the elastic limit approximation .",
    "this justifies the choice of ( [ copinfor2 ] ) as the random force correlator in model ii .",
    "the disorder term then posseses the statistical tilt symmetry ( sts ) @xmath313 where @xmath314 is an arbitrary function . in this case",
    "one can absorb any * static * change in @xmath11 without affecting the correlations of the pinning force .",
    "furthermore in the case of isotropic elasticity , the additional inversion symmetry @xmath300 holds .    though we will study the complete model ii in sections [ sec : pert ] and [ beyond ] its main physics can be understood@xcite by noticing that the pinning force @xmath315 in ( [ pinham ] ) naturally splits into a _",
    "static _ and a time - dependent part : @xmath316 the static part of the random force comes from the modes such that @xmath317 which exist for any direction of the velocity commensurate with the lattice .",
    "the maximum effect is obtained for @xmath12 parallel to one principal lattice direction , the situation we study now .",
    "this force originates * only * from the periodicity along @xmath17 and the uniform density modes along @xmath16 , i.e the smectic - like modes .",
    "since this static pinning force @xmath92 is along the @xmath17 direction , it is useful consider only the transverse part ( along @xmath17 ) of the equation of motion ( [ eqmotion ] ) dropping @xmath318 .",
    "this leads to introduce model iii , defined by the following equation of motion in the laboratory frame : @xmath319 although for non isotropic elasticity @xmath37 also appears in the equation of motion for @xmath38 , and can in principle lead to additional static effects , it is not included in model iii for reasons which will be explained below .",
    "iii only involves the _ transverse _",
    "displacements @xmath38 .",
    "it posesses the same symmetries as model ii with the three additional independent symmetries @xmath300 , @xmath320 and ( @xmath297 , @xmath321 ) and is also defined in the elastic limit .    it is to be emphasized that although the derivation of model iii was given here systematically starting from an elastic description .",
    "the only serious hypothesis behind model iii is the existence of transverse periodicity @xcite . as discussed in section  [ sec : themg ] ( [ staticequ ] ) will be the correct starting point to describe * any * kind of structure have such transverse periodicity properties .",
    "one thus expects model iii to be the generic equation containing the physics necessary to describe these structures .",
    "let us start by a simple perturbation analysis of the equation of motion model ii .",
    "such a large velocity or weak disorder expansion has a long history in various contexts such as vortex lattices @xcite and charge density waves @xcite .",

    "it is easy to see that because of the absence of ir divergence in the integral for @xmath263 the exponent at the threshold remains uncorrected , i.e @xmath554 with @xmath141 ( to first order in @xmath142 ) .",

    "the growth of the average of @xmath556 implies that there is a static random force generated .",
    "however , unlike in the @xmath93 case , the critical force does not kill the random force in the frg equation .",
    "in fact the moving glass will be dominated by the _ competition _ between the random force and the critical force .",
    "although the existence of such a random force has no effect on pinning it will affect strongly the positional correlation functions .",

    "note that there will be an interesting crossover at low @xmath7 where @xmath490 will first start to increase violently before it finally decreases again to its fixed point value .",
    "this will be discussed in following section .",
    "the case of @xmath2 can be studied similarly . as in the case",
    "@xmath1 one looks again for a solution decaying as @xmath612 ( as we noticed before @xmath142 and @xmath612 play the same role ) .    here",
    "the solution in @xmath2 is as follows .",
    "one has :    @xmath613    this ansatz gives the same equation as in @xmath21 with @xmath614 .",
    "thus @xmath615 is still the asymptotic solution .",
    "also :    @xmath616    thus at large scale temperature decays back to @xmath1 .",
    "indeed the fixed point function is very similar to the @xmath1 fixed point function except in small layer around integer @xmath11 .",
    "near the origin the term @xmath617 is of same order as @xmath618 .",
    "thus the main effect of temperature is to round the non analyticity .",
    "we now discuss the behaviour of the mobility @xmath619 and of the i - v characteristics .",
    "one can compute the mobility from the rg equation by integrating the @xmath528 dependent solution over all scales :    @xmath620    since asymptotically there are only finite corrections to @xmath263 as soon as @xmath90 this integral converges .",
    "thus there is a non zero asymptotic mobility @xmath234 in the @xmath22 moving glass ( by contrast with what one would have in the static bragg glass at @xmath22 ) .",
    "however the renormalized mobility @xmath234 will be very small ( for experimental purposes ) in several cases ( i ) at low temperature ( ii ) for velocities not very large @xmath621 .    a complete calculation of @xmath234 in all regimes",
    "can be made by examining the rg equations derived above .",
    "here we give an estimate for the low temperature behaviour .",
    "a key point is that at low temperature @xmath234 will be determined by the short scale contributions .",
    "indeed there must be some continuity with the @xmath1 flow , where @xmath622 diverges after a finite length scale , the larkin length @xmath623 ( as discussed above ) .",
    "thus at low temperature @xmath622 will first shoot up near the larkin length , strongly renormalizing the mobility downwards , before the temperature catches on and reduces it back to its fixed point value @xmath624 .",
    "note that this fixed point value corresponds to values of disorder _ much larger _ than the original disorder . indeed restoring the factors one sees that ( in @xmath2 ) that the original disorder dimensionless parameter is @xmath625 at weak disorder while asymptotically one has @xmath626 .",
    "the global behaviour with length scale is illustrated in the fig .",
    "( [ 2deriv ] ) .    the small @xmath7 behaviour in @xmath2 can be estimated as follows .",
    "let us denote @xmath627 the bare value .",
    "one has the exact equations :    @xmath628    we will roughly estimate the scale @xmath629 at which the term @xmath630 starts slowing down the growth of @xmath490 . for this we will drop the term @xmath631 ( thus assume that for @xmath632 the flow is identical to @xmath1 ) . integrating the equations then yields @xmath633 denoting the bare values of the derivatives of the disorder correlator by @xmath634 and @xmath635 .",
    "this length scale is very close to the larkin length and the end result is that :    @xmath636    thus this argument indicates that as @xmath637 the renormalized mobility will vanish as :    @xmath638      as was mentionned in the section [ sec : themg ] there are many possible generalization of the moving glass equation to a larger class of non potential model .",
    "let us indicate here the general frg equation for these models .",
    "we consider a dynamical equation with a @xmath88 component field @xmath30 and static disorder described by some force correlator @xmath639 .",
    "then , as shown in the appendix , the corrections to disorder will be :    @xmath640    where we have defined the static response @xmath641 .",
    "note that this formula is valid for a large class of models with arbitrary response function .",
    "it does _ not _ suppose for instance that the random force correlator is the second derivative of a random potential .",
    "> from this a generalized frg equation can be derived , which depends on the divergences contained in the response function .",
    "a special case is when @xmath90 and isotropy is assumed ( the simplest @xmath88 component generalization of the moving glass equation ( [ movglasseq2 ] ) . then one finds :    @xmath642    where @xmath476 is a numerical constant",
    ".    the temperature can be added . in the isotropic case",
    "it simply produces an extra term @xmath643 in the above equation .",
    "finally let us close this section by a remark on the nature of the mg fixed point .",
    "the role played by @xmath407 ( apart from a regulator ) is a bit mysterious .",
    "indeed one can wonder whether these results could be obtained directly from the following _ static _ equation for @xmath644 :    @xmath645    which contains only the operators which are relevant at the fixed point . indeed",
    "the final results for the fixed point of the moving glass involve only ( and presumably to all orders in perturbation theory ) zero frequency ( i.e static ) propagators ( at zero temperature and at zero applied external force ) .",
    "if one is too naive and uses an ito scheme in @xmath16 this equation [ toosimplestatic ] becomes trivial and leads to only a random force .",
    "it is probable that when the full non linearity of @xmath646 is kept , and the @xmath16 discretization treated properly ( which may be subtle ) the proper result is found .",
    "it probably then lies entirely in a proper regularization of the corresponding functional determinant ( in a sense the dynamics in @xmath647 that we use here can serve as such a regularization ) .",
    "we leave this for future investigations .",
    "as stressed in the introduction , it is important to first study the elastic theory as a function of the dimension @xmath31 , before attempting to include topological defects . up to now",
    "we have studied the moving glass equation in an @xmath21 expansion .",
    "this study is of course mostly relevant for the physical dimension @xmath2 . to study the other physically interesting dimension @xmath3 another rg calcluation",
    "can be performed .",
    "for the _ statics _ @xmath93 the rg approach was constructed by cardy and ostlund co @xcite .",
    "it was later extended to study equilibrium dynamics @xcite and , with some additional assumptions , to study the problem in @xmath23 . in the case",
    "@xmath93 it yields a marginal glass phase in @xmath3 for @xmath648 described by a line of perturbative fixed points .",

    "( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( rsb quelque part ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )    in this section we first show that in @xmath3 the co fixed line is _ unstable _ to a finite @xmath12 on the simplest case of @xmath406 component moving glass equation .",
    "we derive the rg equations for the case @xmath90 .",
    "we stress that this is a toy model since it is clear that in @xmath3 additional instabilities to dislocations will occur at the temperatures where we can control the behaviour of the model .",
    "however it is instructive , as we will see , and provide the first necessary step to introduce the other instabilities .",
    "the equation that we study is : @xmath649 where @xmath650 is the random nonlinear pinning force with @xmath651 and @xmath652 is the disorder originating from long wavelength disorder ( [ couplage ] ) with : @xmath653 in addition such terms are generated in perturbation theory ( at least for @xmath93 ) and should thus be added from the start .",
    "we use everywhere the shorthand notation @xmath654 where is the bare value of the friction coefficient .",
    "since we are looking at a periodic system one has @xmath655 . however in @xmath3 where temperature is _ marginal _ the harmonics are relevant at different temperatures .",
    "this remains true at @xmath90 .",
    "it is thus enough to consider the lowest harmonic @xmath656 perturbation theory is carried in appendix  [ appendix2d ] using the msr formalism .",
    "note that the random forces @xmath591 can be eliminated by a shift and do not feedback in the rg ( see [ appendix2d ] ) .",
    "in addition due to the tilt symmetry ( galilean invariance ) @xmath407 , @xmath408 and @xmath12 have no corrections .",
    "one finds to first order in @xmath657 the following corrections to the friction coefficient , the temperature , and the disorder : @xmath658 where @xmath659 ^ 2\\rangle_0 $ ] and @xmath660 are respectively the correlation and response functions in the theory without disorder . in the case",

    "of course at small velocity there will be a complicated crossover where the short distance properties are dominated by the static solution , but the large distance properties will be again given by the present rg equations . introducing the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath671 ( [ corrections ] ) and ( [ bcut ] ) allow to obtain the correction to @xmath672 as : @xmath673 which yield the rg equations upon a change of cutoff @xmath674 : @xmath675 the last equality being valid near the transition at @xmath676 .",

    "there is thus no renormalization of @xmath263 at large scales .",
    "the final rg equations in @xmath3 read : @xmath679 with @xmath680 is a nonuniversal constant .",
    "let us analyze the rg flows .",
    "we introduce the reduced temperature @xmath681 and @xmath682 .",
    "the rg equations are : @xmath683 the trajectories are the arches of parabolaes represented in figure  [ fig : co ] centered around @xmath684 , of equation : @xmath685 ( note that close to @xmath676 these trajectories are not modified by the higher order terms ) .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig : co ] if one starts at small disorder with temperature @xmath686 , both disorder and temperature first increase pushing the system in a region where the disorder is irrelevant , ending up with a disorder free system at about @xmath687 .",
    "this has several physical consequences :    \\(i ) at finite velocity the effect of disorder is weaker than in the statics , which manifest itself in the rg equation since weak disorder becomes irrelevant for @xmath688 a region which is already deep in the glass phase in the statics .",
    "this effect is analogous to the dimensional shift from @xmath435 in the statics to @xmath438 .",
    "\\(ii ) however we still find a transition at @xmath676 below which disorder is relevant and grows under rg .",
    "that such a region where disorder is relevant exist in @xmath3 is compatible with the frg findings in @xmath21 and clearly shows that even in motion one still has to consider the effect of the random potential .",
    "however due to the importance of the thermal effects in @xmath3 , at large enough scales the disorder will stop being relevant since the temperature also increases .",
    "the lenght scale @xmath689 at which disorder becomes again negligible can be estimated from the rg and reads : @xmath690 @xmath689 cna become extremely large when the disorder is weak or when one starts at low enough temperatures .",

    "given the present result near @xmath684 possible topologies of the flow in @xmath3 can be proposed as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : co ] . in any case",
    "the relevance of disorder at low temperature is a very good confirmation of the presence of the moving glass phase at least at @xmath1 for which temperature renormalization effects are absent .",

    "two flow diagrams are in principle possible . in one of them",
    "a low temperature phase exist ( mg ) . in that case",
    "an additional fixed point which controls the transition is necessary . in the absence of such a fixed point the moving glass will always be unstable due to temperature renormalization .",

    "we stress that this is based on the assumption that the rg functions are well behaved around @xmath3 .",
    "it has been used though in other cases such as the @xmath693 model .",
    "taking into account the dimensions , one readily obtains using the same reduced variables , to lowest order :    @xmath694    with @xmath695 being a universal ( regularization independent ) number ( by analogy with co ) .",
    "these equations now have a new fixed point at @xmath696 and @xmath697 ( note that @xmath698 is universal ) .",
    "to lowest order the eigenvalues are :    @xmath699    thus without needing to compute the coefficient @xmath700 we know that there is a fixed point , and we know the leading behaviour of the eigenvalues @xmath701 .",
    "such spiralling fixed points have been obtained in other problems ( e.g ref .",
    "however to know whether the fixed point is attractive or repulsive one needs to know the real part , which is controlled by the @xmath702 terms in the rg equation .",
    "for instance , the rg equation will contain at least :    @xmath703    inspection shows that @xmath700 actually controls the leading behaviour of the real part .",
    "so this is the only non linear term we need to compute .",
    "results from frg ( see @xcite ) and static co lead to expect that @xmath704 , but to settle the question and obtain the value of @xmath700 an actual calculation along the lines of @xcite is needed .    it is tempting to associate this fixed point to a finite temperature moving glass fixed point ( analogous to the new finite @xmath7 fixed points found in recent manifold studies @xcite ) .",
    "finally we not that at this fixed point one will have @xmath433 since we find that @xmath705 .",
    "( thus there will be large but finite barriers ) .",
    "in this section we investigate models ii and model iii .      in this section",
    "we come back to the model ii which contains both degrees of freedom transverse @xmath38 and along motion @xmath37 and the full time dependence of the pinning force .",
    "if one describes the elastic flow of a solid , i.e in a regime , or a range of scales where there are no topological defects , this model improves on model iii ( see section intro for a discussion of the regimes where it will be useful ) . as discussed in section [ model ] it is still an approximation , but a rather good one , of the full ( but intractable ) model of the elastic flow ( model i ) .    since model ii is still quite difficult , our aim in this section is more limited than in section [ renormalizationtransverse ] .",
    "we show that the main features of the transverse physics of the moving glass embedded in model iii are also present when the degrees of freedom @xmath37 along the motion are added .",
    "in fact we show explicitly that in model ii the rg equations for along @xmath17 remain _ identical _ to the one of model iii !",
    "the two important issues we discuss are the one of the existence or not of an extra temperature generated by motion , and of the generation of a static `` random force '' .",
    "we perform perturbation theory up to second order in the disorder and examine the new terms generated as well as the divergences .",
    "we develop an approach which allows to treat _ all harmonics _",
    "@xmath706 of the disorder correlator .",
    "first , we find that a static `` random force '' is generated in the direction of motion .",
    "this may seem surprising at first , because first order perturbation theory gives a pinning force along @xmath16 which rapidly oscillates .",
    "however , as our calculation shows , to second order the various washboard frequency harmonics interfere to produce a static random force .",
    "second , we identify the divergences in perturbation theory and follow the evolution of the full disorder correlator under renormalization .",
    "we show that up to some details the resulting picture is close - if not identical - to the one given by model iii .",
    "we work at @xmath1 but the approach can be extended to @xmath22 along the lines of section [ renormalizationtransverse ] .",
    "the equation of motion ( [ startexp],[defr ] ) keeping the time dependent terms reads :    @xmath707    more specifically we will be interested in the model for a triangular lattice ( @xmath708 component model ) with the force applied along a symmetry direction .",

    "note that @xmath711 from the symmetry ( @xmath301 , @xmath300 ) .",
    "we have allowed for different @xmath712 and @xmath713 since , even if they start identical ( and equal to @xmath329 ) they will not remain so under renormalization .",
    "the statistical tilt symmetry ensures that the elastic coefficients and @xmath353 remains uncorrected .",
    "note that in later calculations it will be convenient to rescale the @xmath35 direction , setting @xmath714 .",
    "the correlator of the pinning force can be written as :    @xmath715    it contains all lattice harmonics @xmath51 . due to the modes with @xmath716",
    "it is an explicit _ periodic function of time _ with frequencies all integer multiples of the washboard frequency @xmath717 .",
    "in addition it contains non linear _ static _",
    "components @xmath78 , @xmath718 ( which lead to the model iii treated in section [ renormalizationtransverse ] ) .",
    "finally it contains a static @xmath11-independent component , @xmath719 which we call - by definition - the static `` random force '' .",
    "we believe this is the `` correct '' definition of the random force .",
    "note however that one must distinguish it from @xmath112 .",
    "if one was to compute the displacements correlator to order @xmath720 one would need @xmath112 to second order , which is a different calculation .",
    "the important point is that the static `` random force '' is strictly zero in the bare model @xmath721 , but that it is generated in perturbation theory , as we show below .",
    "the idea behind the method presented here is that strictly at @xmath1 all the time dependence _ remains strictly periodic _ to all orders in perturbation theory in the disorder ( plus a static part ) .",
    "only frequencies multiple of @xmath722 can be generated .",
    "indeed to lowest order @xmath723 is periodic in time , and yields a @xmath11 periodic .",
    "iterating perturbation theory thus leads only to periodic @xmath11 and @xmath724 with integer multiples of @xmath722 .",
    "this property allows us to construct a closed rg scheme of the above model with a renormalized disorder which remains of the form [ periodic ]",
    "an immediate consequence is that _ no temperature is generated _",
    "when @xmath1 at the start .",
    "temperature is defined as the zero frequency limit of the incoherent noise ( or using the msr formalism the vertex function @xmath725 .",
    "thus here one has : @xmath726 the static random force @xmath727 mode leads to a @xmath728 part in @xmath11 and thus is distinct from the temperature .",
    "the fact that no temperature is generated strictly at @xmath1 is a rather strong property of the elastic flow . in physical terms in the @xmath1 elastic laminar periodic flow all particles strictly replace each others after time @xmath729 , i.e @xmath730 where @xmath731 are integer labels for the particles .",
    "it is clearly possible that this laminar periodic flow becomes _ unstable _ to chaotic motion .",
    "it is still very interesting to investigate this laminar periodic flow .",
    "we will thus proceed here assuming here that instabilities to chaos happen only at finite large enough disorder , or at large enough scale .",
    "we reserve the study of the stability of this flow ( chaos , non perturbative effects , etc .. ) to future study .",
    "finally note that this periodic flow is allowed by the assumed absence of topological defects in the system .",
    "dislocations , if present would probably ruin periodicity and introduce a small additional temperature ( though this remains to be investigated ) . finally , it is interesting to note that the present considerations are in stark contradiction with the koshelev - vinokur arguments @xcite about the generation of a `` shaking temperature '' .",
    "we start by establishing the possible form for the disorder correlator ( at any order in perturbation theory ) based on the symmetries of the problem ( model ii ) .",
    "this is highly necessary here because the bare disorder is _ potential _",
    "@xmath732 , but it does not remain of this form in perturbation theory !",
    "we are interested here in the case when the velocity is along a the lattice direction .",
    "our analysis here is very general , and we will specify when we apply it to the case of a triangular lattice .",

    "the symmetries are as follows .",
    "first one can exchange @xmath647 with @xmath733 and @xmath11 with @xmath734 in ( [ periodic ] ) and relabel the disorder term .",
    "this gives @xmath735 .",
    "this is by construction and from the specific dependence in @xmath647 and @xmath733 of the disorder .",

    "this naturally leads to the decomposition @xmath755 where all @xmath756 are even in @xmath51 and @xmath12 and real .",
    "the bare disorder has only @xmath757 non zero and thus posses the extra symmetry @xmath758 or equivalently @xmath759 . because of the convection term @xmath760 in the equation of motion",
    ", this additional symmetry will not hold to higher orders in perturbation theory .",
    "it is natural to suppose that to any fixed order in perturbation theory the @xmath756 are regular when @xmath144 .",
    "thus in the limit @xmath93 one recovers a strictly potential problem ( all terms except @xmath757 vanish ) .",
    "finally note that model iii is a particular case of model ii which corresponds to the follwoing choice of bare parameters : ( i ) isotropic response @xmath761 ( ii ) @xmath762 .",
    "then clearly the equations along @xmath16 and @xmath17 decouple .",
    "another particular case that we note `` en passant '' is to start from @xmath763 and elastic elasticity .",

    "the lowest order corrections to the disorder come from second order perturbation theory .",

    "the first remark is that the random force can not have crossed correlations , i.e @xmath768 .",
    "thus are two independent random forces one along @xmath16 of strength @xmath769 and one along @xmath17 of strength @xmath770 .",
    "this is consistent with formula ( [ param ] ) which gives @xmath771 and vanishes for @xmath727 .",
    "it can also be seen explicitly on the above expression which is found to be symmetric in @xmath753 ( using all the above symmetries ) .",
    "since we know that @xmath772 must be antisymmetric in @xmath773 ( from the above @xmath774 transformation ) it must vanish .",
    "since the above expression is still complicated as it does involve _ all disorder harmonics _ , one must carefully distinguish between :    \\(i ) the static random force generated to lowest order in the bare disorder @xmath775 ( i.e at the initial stage of the rg ) . to this order one can use the _ bare disorder _ in ( [ ranforce ] ) and the resulting perturbative expression of the random force ( evaluated below )",
    "is found to be well behaved and without ir divergences .",
    "of course once even a small finite random force is generated it is relevant by power counting and must be taken into account ( though it does not feedback in the rg for the non linear disorder ) .",
    "\\(ii ) the static random force generated to higher orders in perturbation theory ( or at the next stages of the rg ) .",

    "this means that non trivial corrections originating from the non linear disorder will have to be also taken into account to estimate the random force generated .",
    "this is done in the next subsection .",
    "thus we start by giving the expression of the random force generated from the bare disorder ( i ) .    setting @xmath763 in ( [ ranforce ] )",
    "one finds :    @xmath776    note that it does vanish for @xmath93 as it should since the problem becomes potential in that limit .",
    "one can first specify this formula for the case @xmath761 .",
    "we also set @xmath777 ( which is consistent since we are just looking at the lowest order contribution in perturbation theory ) .",

    "one checks that indeed @xmath779 .",
    "the integral for @xmath770 is infrared divergent , as discussed above ( which is natural from the analysis in section ( ) ) and will be examined in the next section .",
    "let us estimate the magnitude of the static random force generated along @xmath16 .",
    "from the above expression ( [ isotrop ] ) one finds in the case @xmath79 relevant for point lattices ( in @xmath780 ) : @xmath781 where @xmath782 .",
    "there is a crossover velocity @xmath783 .",
    "one has defined @xmath784 and @xmath785 and @xmath708 for triangular lattices .",
    "this yields for @xmath549 : @xmath786    in the case @xmath180 one can simply retain only the transverse mode ( thus setting @xmath787 in the above formulae . in the case",
    "@xmath788 ( relevant for line lattices ) we will only give the large @xmath12 estimate ( valid for @xmath789 ) .",
    "it reads :    @xmath790    let us stress again that we have defined the random force as @xmath791 ( which we believe is the `` correct '' definition ) . if one was to compute the displacements correlator @xmath792 to order @xmath720 , in order to show that the displacements `` feel '' the random force ( e.g and grow unboundedly in the @xmath16 or @xmath17 direction ) one would need @xmath112 to second order ( and to be consistent the response function corrected to order @xmath111 ) which is a different calculation .",
    "while it will make little difference in an order of magnitude estimates for the effect of the @xmath16 random force , it is drastically different along @xmath17 ( one quantity ir diverges and the other does not - see section [ renormalizationtransverse ] , @xmath112 has no divergence ) ! !",
    "we will now look for the divergences in perturbation theory which appear in model ii .",
    "we will address only the case @xmath90 .",
    "let us look again at ( [ full ] ) .",
    "it contains infrared divergences of the same type that was discussed in section [ renormalizationtransverse ] .",
    "these divergences occur only for @xmath793momentum integrals which are _ both _",
    "( i ) zero frequency integrals ( @xmath317 terms ) ( ii ) involve @xmath666 and @xmath794 .",
    "these are of the form : @xmath795 where @xmath796 is the static response function . here",
    "it has the form : @xmath797 where @xmath798 index the transverse and longitudinal projectors and elastic eigenenergies as defined in ( ) .",
    "the key point ( for @xmath708 , e.g triangular lattices ) is that one has here @xmath799 .",
    "thus all projector elements are subdominant for small @xmath666 ( i.e kill the ir divergences ) except the two elements @xmath800 .",
    "thus the only ir divergent elements among ( [ diverg ] ) are @xmath801 .",
    "explicit calculation of the divergent parts gives :    @xmath802    let us now analyze the consequences of these divergences .",
    "> from ( [ full ] ) the relevant corrections to disorder are :    @xmath803\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that there is no component @xmath804 in the bare action but that it is generated in perturbation theory .",
    "this expression simplifies because of the symmetries discussed above and the fact that only the terms ( [ divergents ] ) appear in ( [ towardsrg ] ) ( the term @xmath805 always occurs in sums symmetrized over @xmath806 and one can use that @xmath807 to cancel all crossed @xmath808 terms ) . from what remains one finally obtains the following rg equations :    @xmath809    with @xmath810 and @xmath811 if one uses the same regularisation as in section [ renormalizationtransverse ] it turns out that these complicated looking equations have some simplifying features .",
    "the rg equations ( [ rg2 ] ) are thus the generalization to model ii of the rg equations of model iii and contain both the physics of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "they show that in the moving bragg glass , non trivial non linear effects also occur in the direction of motion .",
    "a more detailed study of these equation will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here we give their salient features .",
    "the rg equations ( [ rg2 ] ) exhibit remarkable features .",
    "first , the subset of these equations for @xmath812 closes onto itself ! !",
    "indeed one finds :    @xmath813    this is exactly the rg equation of the moving glass model iii ! !",
    "thus we have shown that the model iii describes correctly the transverse physics , as announced , within model ii .",
    "one can also write the above rg equations as coupled differential equations for three periodic functions of two variables @xmath814 with @xmath815 . we will temporarily use the shorthand notation @xmath816 and @xmath817 .",
    "let us denote @xmath818 by @xmath819 .",
    "let us absorb the factor @xmath820 in the @xmath111 .",
    "these coupled rg equations become :    @xmath821    with @xmath822 and @xmath823 and @xmath824    or equivalently :    @xmath825    ( dropping temporarily the @xmath753 index ) .",
    "the function @xmath819 obeys the closed rg equation :    @xmath826    and thus @xmath819 converges towards the moving glass fixed point @xmath827 .",
    "let us now examine the behaviour of the other components of the disorder with @xmath78 ( and @xmath753 = @xmath828 , @xmath829 ) .",
    "they obey the equation : @xmath830 one easily sees that @xmath639 also becomes _ non analytic _ beyond the dynamical larkin length since : @xmath831    and thus the divergence of @xmath832 at the larkin length @xmath833 ( see section [ renormalizationtransverse ] ) implies that @xmath834 also diverges .",
    "thus @xmath835 does become non analytic .",
    "note that the solution of this equation is simply @xmath836 .",
    "it is then easy to show that @xmath837 is a stable fixed point solution ( up to the usual growing constant ) . indeed , inserting the fixed point value @xmath819 in ( [ second ] ) one finds exactly the stability operator of the original fixed point .",
    "this was discussed in appendix [ stability ] and the results there shows the stability within the space of ( non analytic ) periodic functions .",
    "the constant @xmath476 can be determined .",
    "indeed one can also use ( [ second ] ) to study @xmath838 .",
    "one gets @xmath839 .",
    "the exponential convergence of @xmath840 towards its fixed point implies that @xmath657 is a finite constant .",
    "this determines @xmath476 .",
    "thus at the fixed point one can replace @xmath841 in [ rg22 ] .",
    "thus we have shown that the rg equations in a moving bragg glass decouple completely along @xmath17 , giving back the one of the generic moving glass studied in section [ renormalizationtransverse ] .",
    "a complete study of the system [ rg2 ] will be given elsewhere .",
    "we now come back to the problem of establishing the correct long wavelength hydrodynamic description of a moving structure with some internal order described by a displacement field @xmath842 .",
    "the first step is to write an equation of motion which contains all terms which are ( i ) allowed by symmetry and ( ii ) a priori relevant in the long wavelength limit by power counting .",
    "we carry this step here , check that all these terms are indeed generated in perturbation theory from the original equation of motion [ labase ] , and estimate their magnitude . the second step , which is to solve the universal large distance physics of such an equation turns out here to be a formidable task , which goes beyond this paper .",
    "as we have discussed in section [ model ] the problem of driven lattices posses some additional `` almost exact '' symmetries which allow to simplify the hydrodynamic description and to extract some of the physics .",
    "this has lead us to study model ii ( section [ frgcomplete ] ) which posses the statistical tilt symmetry forbidding many terms , and the simpler model iii ( section [ renormalizationtransverse ] ) ( the moving glass equation ) which we believe contains most of the physics of moving structures , i.e the physics of the transverse degrees of freedom .    as discussed in section [ model ]",
    "the only exact symmetries of the problem , for motion along a symmetry direction of the moving structure ( @xmath16 axis ) are the spatial inversions along the directions transverse to the velocity .",
    "power counting shows that the general form for the equation of motion in @xmath0 is ( model i ) :    @xmath843    where the velocity @xmath12 is fixed by the convention that @xmath844 and @xmath4 is the applied force .",
    "the kpz terms are allowed because @xmath89 is dimensionless at the upper critical dimension @xmath845 in a power counting at @xmath1 .",
    "this can also be seen by writing a msg formulation of ( [ general0 ] ) .",
    "the above equation of motion is not fully complete unless one specifies the relevant disorder and thermal noise correlators .",
    "the thermal noise has a gaussian correlator @xmath846 , in general anisotropic .",
    "the correlator of the pinning force @xmath847 ( which has zero average ) is gaussian and of the form : @xmath848 where @xmath639 is a periodic function in the case of periodic structure .",
    "note however that in general , @xmath639 is not a potential disorder .    compared to model ii ,",
    "cutoff effects which break the exact statistical tilt symmetry allow new terms to be generated , such as linear terms which correct the original convection term @xmath760 and non linear kpz type terms .",
    "the linear terms are obviously relevant and the non linear kpz terms , in presence of the disorder , are relevant for @xmath0 .",
    "thus once they are generated , even if their bare value is very small it may grow under rg and become important at large scale ( a full solution of the rg equations for ( [ general0 ] ) would be needed in order to conclude ) .",
    "however one may guess that since the statistical tilt symmetry is `` almost exact '' , the scale at which these new term are able to change the physics compared to model ii and model iii ( if they do ) may be very large here . finally note that there are also small corrections to the elastic matrix .",
    "the above approach consists in writing a model independent equation ( [ general0 ] ) based on symmetry arguments",
    ". it may be useful in proving the universality of the behaviours of various structures .",
    "however , in many cases it is much more instructive to start from a given simple model without disorder , such as [ labase ] , and to estimate the bare values of the new terms to first order in a perturbation theory in disorder . indeed , in the absence of disorder",
    "the above equation of motion reduces to :    @xmath849    we have thus computed in the appendix [ linear ] the corrections to first order in perturbation theory with respect to disorder to all terms of the equation ( [ general0 ] ) .",
    "though the above equation ( [ general ] ) looks formidable many terms are zero from the exact inversion symmetry .",
    "we thus now explicity specify the terms allowed in the equation of motion , for the case of an elastic structure described by a @xmath708 component displacement field ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) . in @xmath3 and @xmath2 the equation along @xmath17 should be odd under the inversion ( @xmath301 , @xmath300 ) and also under ( @xmath850 ) while the equation along @xmath16 must be even under these transformations .",
    "this yields in @xmath2 :    @xmath851    and the same in @xmath3 with @xmath852 .",
    "while the full analysis of ( [ general ] ) goes beyond the present we now present some arguments showing that the linear terms , by themselves are unlikely to alter drastically the physics of the moving glass .",
    "the physical interpretation of the linear terms is that now the local velocity explicitly depend on the local strain rates of the structure . though this may generate instabilities ( see below ) , unless an instability occurs",
    ", this is unlikely to alter the transverse physics .",
    "indeed one can see that small additional linear terms do _ not _ remove the divergence in perturbation theory which was the hallmark of the moving glass .",
    "let us write @xmath853 , @xmath854 , @xmath855 , @xmath856 and consider @xmath857 as small compared to @xmath12 . also we choose for simplicity isotropic elasticity @xmath858 , @xmath859 .",
    "then the eigenvalues of the @xmath860 ( static ) response matrix are :    @xmath861    and eigenvectors @xmath862 .",
    "note that one must have @xmath863 otherwise an instability develops .",
    "the perturbation theory result shows that indeed @xmath863 at least to lowest order in the disorder .",
    "one finds for instance that the integral which is the key of the frg equation for the transverse modes ( ) reads :    @xmath864    as is easily seen this integral is infrared divergent for @xmath0 , logarithmically in @xmath2 and power like in @xmath3 ( since @xmath857 is a small correction to @xmath12 ) .",
    "the divergences occur in two hyperplanes @xmath865 which are tilted symmetrically with respect of the direction of motion .",
    "let us now reexamine the moving glass equation , i.e model iii , and ask whether cutoff effects ( absence of exact statistical tilt symmetry ) will generate new relevant terms . by definition",
    "this equation involves only @xmath38 and thus the only a priori relevant terms allowed by symmetry are :    @xmath866    now , we have shown in section [ renormalizationtransverse ] that at the moving glass fixed point @xmath867 and thus the kpz term @xmath868 is irrelevant by power counting .",
    "note that a cubic kpz terms @xmath869 is allowed by symmetry but again irrelevant near @xmath2 .",
    "thus the moving glass equation model iii is stable to cutoff effects and perfectly consistent .",
    "this lead us to claim in @xcite that while previous descriptions of moving systems , such as manifolds driven in periodic @xcite or disordered potentials @xcite , focused on the generation of dissipative kpz , such terms are much less important in the moving glass equation , a problem which , because of periodicity , belongs to a new universality class .",
    "finally one can also reexamine model ii , the physics of which is presumably very similar to model iii at least as far as the transverse degrees of freedom are concerned .",
    "this will certainly hold below a ( large ) length scale max(@xmath870 , @xmath871 ) .",
    "above one must worry about the new terms .",
    "power counting at @xmath2 ( where @xmath38 and @xmath37 are dimensionless ) in the equation for the transverse degrees of freedom @xmath38 ( using that @xmath867 in the absence of the new terms ) shows that the only kpz term marginally relevant at the model ii fixed point in @xmath2 ( and thus the dangerous one ) is the term @xmath872 .",
    "note also that the linear term @xmath873 also becomes relevant there and will change the counting . in the end",
    "it is probable that all terms in equation ( [ general ] ) will have to be treated simultaneously to get the physics beyond max(@xmath870 , @xmath871 ) .",
    "finally we note that the arguments given in the previous section about the fact that no temperature is generated at @xmath1 are unspoiled by the new terms generated here in the equation of motion compared to model ii .",
    "that these new terms may lead to other instabilities of the periodic time ordered flow resulting in chaotic motion is clearly an interesting possibility deserving further investigations .",
    "in this paper we have studied the problem of moving structures ( such as vortex lattices ) in a disordered medium following the new physical approach developped in ref . .",
    "the main new emphasis in that approach is that because of degrees of freedom transverse to motion , periodic structures have a radically different physics than more conventional driven manifolds .",
    "the main consequence of our study is that the moving structures remain different from a perfect structures ( e.g. a perfect crystal ) at all velocities ( for @xmath195 for uncorrelated disorder ) .",
    "in particular they still exhibit glassy behaviour .",
    "the moving configurations can be generally described in terms of _ static channels _ which are the easiest paths in which particles follow each other in their motion .",
    "we have introduced here several degrees of approximation of this problem , embodied in several models .",
    "the simplest one , model iii , introduced in ref . focuses only on the transverse degrees of freedom .",
    "a more complex one model ii also contains degrees of freedom along the direction of motion .",
    "we have studied these models using several renormalization group techniques as well as physical arguments .",
    "all our calculations and results confirm that focusing on the transverse degrees of freedom ( model iii ) gives the main physics for this problem .",
    "indeed we have shown that the more complete model ii leads to the same physics as model iii .    at zero temperature",
    "we have explicitely demonstrated that the physics of the moving glass is governed by a new non trivial attractive disordered fixed point . using the rg ,",
    "we have explicitly demonstrated the existence of the transverse critical force predicted in ref .",
    ", which is related to the nonanalytic behavior of the renormalized disorder correlator at the fixed point .",
    "its actual value , computed from the rg coincides with the estimate given in ref .",
    "based on the existence of a dynamical larkin length @xmath108 .",
    "we have also found that at @xmath1 no temperature is generated because perfect time periodicity is maintained .",
    "we have also shown that a static random force is generated both along and perpendicular to the directions of motion . as a consequence relative displacements in both @xmath16 and @xmath17 directions grow logarithmically in @xmath2 , but algebraically in @xmath3 .",
    "thus in @xmath2 at weak disorder or at large velocity , the moving glass retains quasi - long range order and divergent bragg peaks .",
    "since the decay of translational order is very slow in @xmath2 we predict that a glassy moving structure with quasi long range order and perfect topological order in all directions exists : the moving bragg glass .",
    "the determination of its physical properties is the main result of this paper .",
    "this phase is the natural continuation to non zero velocities of the static bragg glass .",
    "we have investigated the effect of a non zero initial temperature .",
    "we found that the moving bragg glass survives at finite temperature as a phase distinct from a perfect crystal and with properties continuously related to the zero temperature moving bragg glass . at low temperature",
    "the moving bragg glass still exhibits a highly non - linear transverse velocity - transferse force characteristics with an `` effective transverse critical current '' ( in the same sense as for the longitudinal critical current ) .",
    "note however that at @xmath22 the frg calculation indicates that the asymptotic behaviour is linear but with a strongly suppressed transverse mobility at low temperature .",
    "in addition the existence of elastic channels provides a new and precise way to look at the problem of generation of dislocations in moving structures .",
    "the natural transition is now a decoupling of the channels with dislocations decoupling the adjacent layers .",
    "it is indeed easier to decouple the channels via shear deformations than to destroy the channel structure altogether .",
    "this leads to expect another moving glass phase which keeps a periodicity along @xmath17 , which has been termed moving transverse glass . since it retains a periodicity along the direction perpendicular to motion it shares the properties of moving glasses , and in particular it exhibit a non zero transverse critical force at @xmath1 .",
    "we have given predictions for the phase diagram of moving systems .",
    "it shows that the existence of the bragg glass phase in the statics has profound implications on the dynamical phase diagram as well .",
    "indeed it is natural to connect continuously the static bragg glass ( at @xmath93 ) to the moving bragg glass ( at @xmath505 ) .",
    "thus there should be a wide range of velocities ( down from the creep region to the fast moving region ) where effects associated with transverse periodicity ( such as the transverse critical force ) should be observed .",
    "we have analyzed the crossovers between the bragg glass properties and the moving glass properties in the region where the velocity is not large .",
    "further experimental consequences should be investigated in details for vortex systems in motion .",
    "a direct measurement of the transverse @xmath8 characteristics at low temperature would be of great interest .",
    "but consequences for the phase diagrams should be explored too .",
    "it was predicted in @xcite that the static bragg glass should undergo a transition into an amorphous glassy state upon increase of disorder . as discussed in @xcite",
    "the field induced transition observed in many experiments is the likely candidate for such a transition .",
    "a similar prediction can be made in the dynamics , namely that the moving bragg glass will experience a field induced transition into an amorphous moving phase .",
    "a detailed investigation of these transitions may help understand the nature of the high field pinned phase .",
    "indeed the nature of the transition away from the bragg glass may change once the system moves if the moving amorphous phase is different from the static amorphous phase .",
    "if the `` vortex glass '' phase @xcite exists at all in the statics in @xmath2 , one may expect that it would not survive as smoothly as the bragg glass once the system is set in motion .",
    "another consequence is that there should be a first order melting transition at weak disorder or at large @xmath12 upon raising temperature from a moving bragg glass to a flux liquid .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to investigate whether the anomalous response to transverse forces could have an impact on the anomalous hall angle .",
    "as we have discussed , other experimental systems , such as wigner crystals , seem to be a promising arena to investigate the physics presented here",
    ". finally it would be interesting to reinvestigate more complex cdw systems such as double @xmath76 or triple @xmath76 .",
    "another direct experimental consequence , in the case of correlated disorder is that one should observe a `` moving bose glass '' .",
    "static columnar disorder in vortex systems is strong but at large velocity one should expect that the effective disorder becomes weaker .",
    "thus the bose glass driven at low temperature should have interesting properties such as discussed here .",
    "the resulting moving bose glass should exhibit a transverse critical force and retain a transverse meissner effect in the direction perpendicular to motion .",
    "the novel properties of periodic driven systems discussed in this paper also suggest many other directions of investigation . as for the statics",
    "one outstanding problem is to treat properly dislocations in the moving glass system .",
    "a controlled calculation may seem out of reach , but on the other hand the existence of elastic channels suggests a new and precise way to look at the problem of generation of dislocations in moving structures and may provide a starting point @xcite .",
    "solving this issue starting from large velocity is already a formidable task , but could help us to understand what happens close to the threshold . indeed here again only simple cases , inspired from the manifold or cdw with scalar displacements and no transverse periodicity , have been considered previously . as in the statics it is possible that the physics is modified in a quite surprising way , and certainly all the issues about critical behavior close to threshold , dynamics reordering , elastic to plastic motion transitions , will have to be reconsidered .",
    "these issues are of major theoretical concern but also of large practical importance .",
    "finally we note that though model i remains to be tackled in order to reach a complete description of the lattice elastic flow , we have shown that the extra linear terms do not seem to change drastically the main features of perturbation theory .",
    "the kpz terms remain to be treated , but an interesting possibility would be that again because of periodicity their effect would be weaker than expected .    another interesting issue is to understand to which extent a moving , or more generally a non potential system can be glassy .",
    "this concept may seem doomed from the start since one could conclude that the constant dissipation in the system would tend to kill glassy properties .",
    "however there too the situation may be more subtle and leave room for unexpected behavior .",
    "we have proposed the moving glass as a first physical realization of a `` dissipative glass '' , i.e. a glass with a constant dissipation rate in the steady state .",
    "other realizations of non potential glassy systems have been studied since , in spin systems @xcite or for elastic manifolds in random flows such as polymers @xcite .",
    "it is important to characterize these glassy effects in driven systems .",
    "too close analogy with glassiness in the statics could be misleading . as we have discussed",
    "it is possible that the existence of a transverse critical force leads to history dependence effects .",
    "these should be checked .",
    "the role of the temperature in moving systems and its relation to entropy production remains puzzling .",
    "it is natural to expect , as in other related non potential systems @xcite that the absence of fluctuation dissipation theorem leads to a generation of a temperature .",
    "this is of course what happens in the rg approach presented here .",
    "this heating effect however is very different from the `` shaking temperature '' ( since it disappears at @xmath1 in the moving bragg glass ) and rather is likely to be related to the entropy production .",
    "hopefully the methods introduced here should allow to understand this relation better .",
    "we have found within the frg that at finite temperature the physics is controlled by a new non trivial finite temperature moving glass fixed point .",
    "this result is strengthened by the fact that another non zero @xmath22 fixed point has also been obtained in the problem of randomly driven polymers , a problem which does have a dissipative glassy phase @xcite .",
    "the problem of understanding dissipative glassy systems is also related to the study of general _ non hermitian _ random operators .",
    "indeed non potential dynamical problems ( including e.g the moving glass ) are described by a fokker planck operator whose spectrum is not necessarily real ( by contrast with potential problems which are purely relaxational ) .",
    "these fokker planck problems with complex spectrum , ( which could be called `` dynamical non hermitian quantum mechanics '' ! ! ) are related to problems which have received a renewed interest recently ( such as vortex lines with tilted columnar defects @xcite , spin relaxation in random magnetic fields @xcite diffusion of particles and polymers in random flows @xcite . exploring this connexion , as well as",
    "the very interesting question of the classification of these glasses and the study of their physical properties is still largely open .    finally other fascinating open questions remain .",
    "the @xmath1 moving bragg glass fixed point , at least within model ii , is a time periodic state .",
    "the general question of the stability of periodic attractors towards chaotic motion is still very much open .",
    "it is related to problems of time coupling and decoupling in non linear dynamics , such as synchronisation of oscillators in josephson arrays , which has been studied extensively recently @xcite or synchronization by disorder @xcite .",
    "the relation between instability to chaos and possible non perturbative generation of a temperature is also intriguing .",
    "indeed one important issue is whether dislocations when present will generate an additional temperature or chaos .",
    "finally , the general question of dynamical elastic instabilities is also related to recently investigated questions about solid friction .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate in solid friction quantities analogous to the transverse response and the transverse critical force once the solid is in motion .",
    "we are pleased to acknowledge many useful and extensive discussions with f. williams , d. geshkeinbeim , l. gurevich f. pardo , m. marchevsky , p. kes , m. ocio , a. kapitulnik , m. charalambous , c. simon .",
    "s. bhattacharya e. andrei",
    "we derive here the contiuum version of the equation of motion for case where it does not derive from an hamiltonian .",
    "it is then more simple to perform the continuum limit in the dynamical martin - siggia - rose ( msr ) action .",
    "one introduces for each particle a conjugate field @xmath874 and an interpolating field similar to the one for @xmath273 such that @xmath875 . using these two fields",

    "the pinning force is thus given by @xmath879 up to now we have made only exact transformations .",
    "note that the disorder term depends of @xmath880 rather than @xmath26 .",
    "this amount in using the origin of the displacements instead of the actual position of the vortex to label the displacement fields . in the elastic limit @xmath881 since @xmath882 where @xmath159 is the lattice spacing .",

    "an integration by part of ( [ fpin ] ) gives back the action coming from the pinning force ( [ pinham ] ) and two additional terms of the form @xmath885 such term coming from the fact that the continuum limit was performed after the functional derivation with respect to @xmath11 , contains only higher gradients , and are negligeable in the elastic limit .",
    "they can in principle however generate relevant terms .",
    "all the allowed relevant terms will be examined in detail in section [ beyond ] .",

    "it is easy to see that if @xmath1138 the above forces are _ non potential _ even if the original one is the gradient of a potential .",
    "one can now compute the new disorder correlator @xmath1139 which has several contributions :              one thus recovers the result of ( [ appendixc ] ) .",
    "the time - dependent problem at @xmath1 can also be analyzed in the same way .",
    "all the above equations up to ( [ forces ] ) are identical with @xmath27 replaced by @xmath1145 and @xmath1146 replaced by @xmath1147 . in ( [ correlators ] ) one gets integrals over times and again the zero - frequency @xmath1146 .",
    "the authors of @xcite did criticize us for setting @xmath20 and use the resulting model iii to describe the physics of the moving glass .",
    "as we pointed out to them , they have missed the important point of physics that irrespective of the behaviour along @xmath16 the physics is controlled by the moving glass equation .                                          in the standard field theory language",
    "this is equivalent to enforce that @xmath1148 .",

    "5.2 p. 119 .",
    "it is interesting to note that some breakdown of the perturbation theory was noticed @xcite in the perturbative calculation of the displacements at fourth order .",
    "the condition for such terms to be negligible was noticed to be violated for a pinning force perpendicular to the flow velocity .",
    "however no direct physical consequences were investigated at that time .",
    "indeed divergences in the perturbation theory are well hidden , and for instance do not appear in the velocity expansion . at lowest order , as can be seen from ( [ hauger ] ) they are killed by terms like @xmath1149 in the numerator that vanish for directions orthogonal to the displacements ."
