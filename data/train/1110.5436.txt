    "the traditional point of view on the origin of cosmic rays in the galaxy is the concept of acceleration of charged particles at fronts of shocks from supernova explosions .",
    "arguments in favour of this mechanism are sufficient mechanical energy that is released when the supernova explodes , as well as universal index of power law spectrum of particles , accelerated by strong shocks .",
    "total power of cosmic ray sources in order to maintain their observed density of energy is @xmath3 , which equals approximately 15% of the kinetic energy of supernova explosions . when the gas compression in a shock is equal to 4 , the index of the power law energy spectrum of accelerated particles is equal to -2 , @xmath4 .",
    "it is in a good agreement with observed cosmic ray spectrum at energies @xmath5 .",
    "beginning from the first works by krymskii , 1977 ; bell , 1978 ; blandford & ostriker , 1978 , who proposed the mechanism of acceleration of charged particles on fronts of shocks propagating in the turbulent environment , much progress has been made to explain the observed characteristics of galactic cosmic rays in the belief that they are accelerated at the front of shocks .",
    "on the other hand , there is no objections to generate galactic cosmic rays in one source in the galaxy ( ptuskin & khazan , 1981 )",
    ". this potential source can be the center of the galaxy , which is the massive black hole of @xmath6 mass . and",
    "while the luminosity of sgr a * is small now , it is only @xmath7 erg / s , in the past the center could be much brighter because its eddington luminosity equals @xmath8 erg / s . on the past activity of the center of the galaxy",
    "shows newly discovered by fermi gamma - ray space telescope above and below the galactic plane big bubbles emitting gamma radiation in the range of @xmath9 gev ( su et al . ,",
    "such formations was previously observed in the x - ray range @xmath10 kev by rosat all - sky survey ( snowden et al . , 1997 ) and",
    "in the microwave range @xmath11 ghz by wmap ( finkbeiner , 2004 ) . estimated energy stored in bubbles is of @xmath12 erg ( sofue , 2000 ) . as we will see below , bubbles of a relativistic gas could be formed by the jet , emitted from surroundings of the massive black hole . here",
    "we provide an alternative mechanism of origin galactic cosmic rays , in which the nucleus of the galaxy in the active phase injected the relativistic jet , which was the source of cosmic rays .    in the following sections we will calculate the power of the jet and the energy spectrum of protons in the relativistic jet , as well as describe the remnants of the relativistic jet injected from the center of the galaxy , having the form of bubbles above and below the galactic plane . in the final section we will discuss correspondence of the scenario of the galactic cosmic rays origin provided with cosmic rays characteristics observed .",
    "sources of energy of active galactic nuclei are the accretion on a massive black hole , in which the gravitational energy of a falling gas transforms into radiation and heat , as well as the rotation of a black hole .",
    "mechanism of extraction of energy and angular momentum from the black hole is called as the mechanism of blandford - znajek ( 1977 ) .",
    "the energy of a rotating black hole is a large value , @xmath13 erg . for the galaxy @xmath14 erg .",
    "here we have introduced the dimensionless parameter of @xmath15 , describing rotation of the black hole , @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 is the black hole angular momentum , @xmath18 is the gravitational constant .",
    "angular velocity of rotation of a black hole is proportional to the value of @xmath15 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the gravitational radius of not rotating black hole @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "energy extraction is possible when there is a poloidal magnetic field @xmath23 near the black hole horizon . in this case , rotating black hole acts as a dynamo machine , creating a voltage @xmath24 ( landau & lifshits , 1984 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath25 is the flux of the poloidal magnetic field reaching the horizon of a black hole , @xmath26 .",
    "voltage @xmath27 generates the electric current @xmath28 , which on the one hand is closed on the horizon of a black hole that has the resistance @xmath29 ohm .",
    "resistance of the outer part of the current loop is @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the power , extracting from a rotating black hole , is @xmath31 , and reaches the maximum @xmath32 at @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "the value of @xmath35 is proportional to the energy of the poloidal magnetic field near a black hole and can reach the eddington luminosity at sufficiently large magnetic fields @xmath36 gauss in the center of the galaxy .",
    "this field is accumulated near the horizon of a black hole in the process of accretion of a disk matter in which the magnetic field is frozen .",
    "thus , for the effective work of the mechanism of blandford - znajek an accretion disk around a massive black hole is required , not as a source of the energy , but as the agent bearing the magnetic field to a black hole .",
    "in addition , the electric current @xmath37 flows in the disk , this is the part of the current loop : in the disk , in the black hole horizon , then in the jet , closing at large distances in the interstellar matter ( see figure 1 ) .        in the disk , in addition to the radial electric current @xmath38 , stronger toroidal current @xmath39 , @xmath40 ,",
    "flows also ( istomin & sol , 2011 ) , it generates the radial magnetic field @xmath23 .",
    "the rotating black hole brings into rotation the radial magnetic field in the magnetosphere of a black hole above and below the disk .",
    "angular velocity of rotation of the magnetic field lines , the same as rotation of the magnetospheric plasma , @xmath41 , is proportional to the angular velocity of rotation of the black hole @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( thorne et al . , 1986 ) .",
    "plasma rotation is the drift motion in crossed radial magnetic field and electric field of plasma polarization .",
    "thus , there appears so - called the light cylinder surface in the black hole magnetosphere , where the magnitude of the electric field is compared with that of the magnetic field and the rotation velocity approaches the speed of light @xmath44 .",
    "the radius of the light surface is @xmath45 . on the light surface",
    "charged particles get considerable energy and angular momentum of rotation .",
    "energy density of particles on the light surface is compared with the energy density of the electromagnetic field @xmath46 ( istomin , 2010 ) .",
    "all energy passes to protons , @xmath47 .",
    "electrons are practically not accelerated due to large synchrotron losses in a strong magnetic field ( istomin & sol , 2009 ) .",
    "energetic protons , accelerated near the light surface , and whose energy is mainly in the azimuthal motion , create the jet .",
    "jet s power is @xmath48 ( istomin & sol , 2011 ) .",
    "here @xmath49 is the non relativistic cyclotron frequency of protons in the magnetic field near the black hole , @xmath50 .",
    "jet arises when the power extracted from the rotating black hole @xmath35 becomes greater than the jet power @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "this imposes a limitation on the value of the magnetic field @xmath53 ^ 4.\\ ] ] for @xmath54 it gives @xmath55 for the center of the galaxy , the magnetic field must satisfy the condition @xmath56 gauss .",
    "we see that to generate a jet , less massive black holes should have a stronger poloidal magnetic field near the horizon , @xmath57 .",
    "in addition , rotation must be fast , close to the critical value of @xmath58 , because of strong dependence of the expression ( 2 ) on @xmath15 .",
    "it should also be noted that the resistance of the external current loop @xmath30 , on which the jet power @xmath51 depends , is not the ohmic one @xmath59 , which turns out to be small , @xmath60 ( istomin & sol , 2011 ) , but is the effective resistance @xmath61 , which can be attributed to the jet , receiving energy from the rotating black hole . if @xmath62 the resistance of the jet is @xmath63 . under the equality in the expression ( 1 )",
    "when a rotating black hole can begin to generate a jet , the expression for the jet s power becomes universal @xmath64 all jet energy are in the energy of protons , and , as we can see , is sufficient for the production of galactic cosmic rays .",
    "istomin and sol ( 2009 ) had shown that on the light surface , produced by the rotating radial magnetic field , which is carried into rotation by a black hole , protons gain considerable energy .",
    "the lorentz factor @xmath65 becomes equal to @xmath66 .",
    "the value of @xmath67 is the lorentz factor of particles in the magnetosphere of a black hole before crossing the light surface .",
    "and the value of @xmath68 is the maximum of the lorentz factor , which could be achieved by a particle in this acceleration mechanism , @xmath69 . here",
    "@xmath70 is the cyclotron frequency of rotation of protons in the poloidal magnetic field near the light surface .",
    "when @xmath71 the cyclotron radius of a proton is compared with the radius of the light surface . for non relativistic particles of the black hole magnetosphere , @xmath72 , the lorentz factor of accelerated particles is equal to @xmath73 . crossing the light surface at different distances @xmath74 from the accretion disk plane , particles gain different energies , since the magnetic field decreases with distance from the black hole . for a radial magnetic field @xmath75 .",
    "thus , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the maximal lorentz factor of accelerated particles near the accretion disk . accelerated protons of the jet are collected from various parts of the light cylinder surface of @xmath78 radius , but located at different distances @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , the number of particles is @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the density of protons in the magnetosphere near the light surface .",
    "connecting values @xmath74 and @xmath65 , we get @xmath81 considering that the vertical size of the magnetosphere is larger than the light surface radius , the density @xmath80 can be taken as constant . as a result",
    "we get the distribution function of relativistic protons in the jet , @xmath82 , @xmath83 we see that in the range @xmath84 the spectrum of relativistic protons is the power law spectrum with the index -2 .",
    "this spectrum is observed in gamma radiation from bubbles above and below the galactic plane by fermi gamma - ray space telescope ( su et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "considering that the gamma radiation occurs due to collisions of relativistic protons with interstellar gas through meson production ( crocker & aharonian , 2011 ) , and the distribution of photons is similar to the distribution of protons , one can conclude that the jet from the center of the galaxy actually existed , and bubbles are filled with relativistic protons of the jet .",
    "the value of @xmath77 is ( istomin & sol , 2011 ) @xmath85 and for @xmath33 equals ( see the expression ( 1 ) ) @xmath86 the spectrum of protons ( 4 ) breaks at @xmath87 and has there the root singularity ( integrable ) that is smoothed considering the thermal dispersion of particles in the magnetosphere of the black hole , @xmath88 . the distribution ( 4 ) is shown on figure 2 .",
    "the value of @xmath77 is chosen to be equal to the lorentz factor of the break in the observed spectrum of cosmic rays at the energy @xmath89 gev , @xmath90 .",
    "this corresponds to the rotation parameter @xmath91 .",
    "the power of the jet ( 3 ) is @xmath92 erg / s .",
    "that is in agreement with estimated from observations powers of jets ejected from active galactic nuclei@xmath93 erg / s ( mao - li et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "relativistic protons with the spectrum ( 4 ) are formed from thermal particles of the black hole magnetosphere , @xmath72 .",
    "but in addition to thermal particles in the magnetosphere there can exist accelerated protons .",
    "the turbulent motion of the accreting disk matter in the presence of the frozen magnetic field leads to acceleration of particles , which have the power law energy spectrum , @xmath94 ( istomin & sol , 2009 ) .",
    "the disk must be turbulent to provide for the abnormal gas transport .",
    "getting onto the light surface , accelerated protons are converted to more energetic , @xmath95 .",
    "their distribution function becomes equal ( istomin & sol 2009 ) @xmath96 .",
    "thus , there is another component of jet relativistic protons , their number is equal to @xmath97 transforming the integration area in ( 6 ) , we get @xmath98 the first term in eq .",
    "( 7 ) corresponds to relativistic protons with energies @xmath99 similar to protons ( 4 ) , accelerated from the thermal gas .",
    "their distribution function equals @xmath100 in the energy range @xmath84 this distribution has the same power law spectrum ( 4 ) , @xmath101 .",
    "but since the number of accelerated particles in the magnetosphere of the black hole is much less than that of thermal particles , the contribution of these particles into the total distribution at @xmath99 can be neglected . the second term in eq .",

    "the distribution ( 8) with @xmath107 and @xmath108 is shown on figure 3 . for energies @xmath109 the distribution of relativistic protons is the power law with index @xmath110 . at @xmath111",
    "the distribution falls down , for @xmath112 and @xmath113 the maximum energy is @xmath114 ev .",
    "we have chosen the value of @xmath115 from the fact that indices of spectrum of cosmic rays before and after the break at energy @xmath116 ev differ on the value of 0.4  the spectrum becomes more soft with the index @xmath117 .",
    "the same difference in indices must be in the source of cosmic rays , which in our case is the relativistic jet . at @xmath115 the index of the spectrum ( 8) equals -2.4 , while the index of the spectrum ( 4 ) is equal to -2 .",
    "it should be noted that the distribution function of relativistic protons ( 4 ) at energies @xmath99 , and ( 8) at energies @xmath118 , is continuous , i.e. @xmath119 .",
    "this is because the acceleration on the light surface undergo protons of the black hole magnetosphere with a unique spectrum ",
    "thermal at low energies , turning into the tail of fast particles up to the energy @xmath120 . if their energy distribution function is @xmath121 , then the distribution of particles , accelerated on the light surface , have also the continuous distribution @xmath122 d{\\cal e}_i / d { \\cal e , } \\ , { \\cal e}_i = { \\cal e}^2/\\gamma_0 m_pc^2 $ ] .    here and hereafter , we talk about protons , bearing in mind that they are heavy particles , unlike electrons .",
    "nuclei of @xmath123 mass and @xmath124 charge will be accelerated effectively also on the light surface . as we saw above",
    ", the efficiency of acceleration depends on the value of @xmath125 .",
    "thus , nuclei will receive energy per nucleon @xmath126 times less than protons .",
    "the center of the galaxy , being active , created a relativistic jet , particles of which spread in the galaxy , forming isotropic background of cosmic rays . if one consider that the angular momentum of the massive black hole in the center of the galaxy coincides with that of the galaxy , than the direction of the jet propagation is perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy .",
    "the jet length can be quite large , so jet in m87 extends @xmath127 kpc .",
    "therefore , above and below the galactic plane ( if we have two almost symmetrical jets ) one can see traces of the jet .",
    "let us consider a simple diffusive model of propagation of relativistic particles , whose source is located in the center of the galaxy @xmath128 , in an interstellar medium @xmath129 here @xmath130 is the velocity of the interstellar matter .",
    "we consider the region outside the stellar galactic disk , then the velocity @xmath130 is the speed of the galactic wind , which is along the coordinates @xmath74 which is perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy .",
    "the value of @xmath131 is the diffusion coefficient , which can be anisotropic .",
    "diffusion depends on the intensity of the magnetic field @xmath23 , falling exponentially with the distance @xmath74 from the galactic plane , @xmath132 kpc",
    ". diffusion of charged particles is determined by their motion in the magnetic field , and the diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to the magnetic field strength , @xmath133 .",
    "so , for the most strong bohm diffusion @xmath134 , @xmath135 is the proton cyclotron radius , @xmath136 .",
    "thus , the particle diffusion increases exponentially with the coordinate @xmath74 , @xmath137 .",
    "such a strong dependence of the diffusion on the coordinate @xmath74 leads to effective non diffusion expansion of particles along this coordinate and decreasing its density . to take into account this effect",

    "the value of @xmath141 is the ratio of the transverse diffusion coefficient @xmath142 , perpendicular to @xmath74 , to the longitudinal one @xmath143 , along @xmath74 , @xmath144 .",
    "we see that in the equation of particle motion there appears the effective velocity along @xmath74 , @xmath145 .",
    "it arises as a result of the exponential growth of the particle diffusion over @xmath74 . for characteristic values of @xmath146 @xmath147/s and @xmath148",

    "this speed is much larger than the speed of the galactic wind @xmath151 , which at distances of several kpc from the galactic plane is less than @xmath152 km / s ( ptuskin , 2007 ) .",
    "although the wind velocity increases with distance @xmath74 , the exponential factor @xmath153 in eq . ( 10 ) , allows us to ignore the velocity of the galactic wind in comparison with the velocity @xmath149 .",

    "the velocity limitation implies the condition @xmath164 , @xmath44 is the speed of the light , which is not difficult to hold because @xmath165 . knowing",
    "the value of @xmath166 from observation one can estimate the time @xmath167 when the power source of cosmic rays in the center of the galaxy begins to work , i.e. when the jet starts , @xmath168 .",

    "i.e. @xmath174 .",
    "this means that in fact @xmath175 .",
    "in addition , one can find the time @xmath176 when the source turns off .",
    "if the jet worked a short time , all particles would have lifted in height at @xmath177 , and we would see their absence near the galactic plane . since this is not observed in bubbles , then @xmath178",
    ".    knowing the solution for @xmath179 at @xmath180",

    "we also draw levels of the constant density @xmath185 , figure 5 .",
    "the value of @xmath186 , the anisotropy of diffusion , is chosen to be equal to @xmath187 from those considerations that the observed ratio of bubble s scales @xmath188 would be consistent with the forms of the constant density profiles painted on figure 5 .",
    "it seems that such value of @xmath141 indicates that the magnetic field in the halo of the galaxy near the center is mostly vertical . and",
    "this is natural because for the cylindrical symmetry radial and azimuthal magnetic field components should approach zero on the axis @xmath189 .",
    "we have shown that whereas in the past the center of the galaxy was active and radiated the jet , its energy and composition are sufficient to explain the origin of cosmic rays in the galaxy .",
    "bubbles of a relativistic gas observed in gamma , x - ray and radio bands above and below the galactic plane , apparently , are remnants of the bipolar jet emitted from the vicinity of the massive black hole in the center of the galaxy .",
    "the vertical size of the bubble @xmath190 kpc permits us to estimate the time of switching on of the jet , @xmath191 years ago .",
    "we can also estimate the lower limit of the jet s work , @xmath192 yr . during the time @xmath193 the jet got the energy @xmath194 erg / s @xmath195 @xmath196 s @xmath197 erg , that is slightly larger than the energy stored in the black hole rotation @xmath198 erg .",
    "however , if we estimate the mass of the accreted matter , absorbed by the black hole at the same time , it can reach a large part of the mass of the black hole , @xmath199 , @xmath200 .",
    "transmitted to the black hole by the accreted matter , the angular momentum @xmath201 can even exceed its initial value ( istomin , 2004 ) .",
    "the jet s energy @xmath198 erg is enough to fill by cosmic rays as the disk ( @xmath202 erg ) , as the halo ( @xmath203 erg ) of the galaxy .",
    "filling of the disk of the galaxy by relativistic particles is described by the same eq . ( 11 ) , but there should be @xmath204 .",
    "therefore , we can ignore the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the distances @xmath74 , and solve the pure diffusion equation @xmath205 here we are interested in distribution of particles in the disk on the transverse distances @xmath140 , so we average this equation over @xmath74 and get @xmath206 where the value of @xmath207 is the diffusion coefficient of cosmic rays in the galactic disk .",
    "the solution is @xmath208 the time @xmath167 is the start time of the jet .",
    "if the jet had worked with constant power @xmath209 and switched off at the time @xmath176 , then the density distribution of cosmic rays in the disk is @xmath210 the solution ( 14 ) shows that if @xmath211 then the distribution of the density over the radius @xmath140 is almost uniform .",
    "for @xmath212 it is logarithmic , @xmath213 , and for @xmath214 it is constant , @xmath215 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient of cosmic rays in the disk equals @xmath216 ( ptuskin , 2007 ) .",
    "the condition @xmath217 kpc is the disk radius , imposes a lower limit on the energy of protons , homogeneously filling the galactic disc , @xmath218 .",
    "apart the diffusion particles can move freely along the regular magnetic field of spiral arms of the galactic disk .",
    "the necessary for filling velocity @xmath219 cm / s @xmath220 c does not contradict the observed anisotropy of cosmic rays @xmath221 , @xmath222 . since the dependence of the distribution ( 14 ) over the energy is determined not only by the energy spectrum of the source @xmath223 but also the dependence of the diffusion coefficient @xmath224 over the energy , the spectrum of particles in the disk will be softer than that in the source .",
    "thus , the discussed mechanism of origin of galactic cosmic rays by the jet , emitted from the center of the galaxy , satisfactorily explains the observed spectrum , the index -2.7 ( -2.6 for the jet ) before the break , and the index -3.1 ( -3.0 for the jet ) after the break .",
    "cosmic rays , filling simultaneously the galactic disk and the halo , flow out from the galaxy .",
    "their lifetime @xmath225 is determined by as the energy loss time @xmath226 , as the time of diffusion leakage from the galaxy after the source of relativistic particles stopped , @xmath227 .",
    "the time @xmath226 is estimated as @xmath228 yr ( strong & moskalenko , 1998 ) .",
    "it is larger than the time of the jet s start @xmath167 , i.e. beginning of the filling of the galaxy by cosmic rays , @xmath229 .",
    "the diffusion time @xmath230 is determined by the distance @xmath231 that particles travel during the period from the switching on of the source @xmath232 .",
    "thus , @xmath233 does not depend on the energy of particles .",
    "this time is also larger than the time of jet s switching off @xmath176 , @xmath234 .",
    "we see that to now the distribution of relativistic particles , generated by the jet , does not change noticeable .",
