    "we identify 33 significant outbursts in the long - cadence light curve of epic 229227292 with the same automated method as used for epic 211629697 ( after discarding four spurious detections that are not corroborated by the short - cadence data ) .",

    "the outbursts reach amplitudes of 49% ( the peak local median of 6 consecutive points in the short cadence light curve ) , with a median duration of 10.2hr before returning to quiescence .",
    "the mean time between outbursts is 2.4d .",
    "the detected outbursts have equivalent durations ( proportional to outburst energy in the _ kepler _  bandpass ) between @xmath38min , with a median of 5.8min .",

    "the peak at @xmath44hz is also highly suggestive , rising to a signal - to - noise of 4.95 ( defined as the ratio of the peak amplitude to the local mean amplitude in the ft , @xmath45 ) , but does not meet our adopted significance criterion . with our significance threshold being a conservative estimate ,",
    "it is difficult to assess the precise likelihood of this frequency belonging to a pulsation mode in the star , but we mention it as a tentative astrophysical signal .",
    "the approach to determining detection thresholds in the fts of _",
    "k2 _  short - cadence observations of @xcite assigns a confidence of @xmath46% to peaks with this signal - to - noise ratio , so this is likely the highest frequency pulsation mode observed in an outbursting dav so far .",
    "the high signal - to - noise of the epic 229227292 data also enables us to explore changes in the pulsations on shorter timescales through the running ft , displayed for the 20th to 55th day of observations in figure [ fig : odav4runningft ] .",
    "this shows the evolution of the ft as calculated for a three - day sliding window on the light curve in the region of pulsational power bands .",
    "individual mode amplitudes are observed to grow and decay dramatically on the timescale of days .",
    "the times of detected outburst peaks are indicated with vertical dotted lines .",
    "we note that the outbursts coincide in many cases with the sudden growth or decay of mode amplitudes , suggesting that the outbursts play a role in redirecting pulsational energy , and that they at least have some effect on the pulsations .",
    "no spectroscopy of epic229227292 existed previous to this work . after discovering pulsations",
    ", we followed up this white dwarf using the goodman spectrograph on the 4.1 m soar telescope @xcite .",

    "a 3  slit , our resolution was seeing limited ; seeing was steady around 1.1  during our observations , yielding a roughly 3.2  resolution .",
    "each exposure had a signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of roughly 17 per resolution element in the continuum at 4600 , for an overall s / n @xmath49 . including overheads , our observations span roughly 18.5min , covering at least one pulsation cycle for most oscillations .",
    "we processed the images using the starlink packages figaro and kappa , and optimally extracted the spectra @xcite using the pamela package @xcite .",
    "wavelength and flux calibration were performed with an fear lamp and the spectrophotometric standard gd  71 , using the molly package .",
    "we fit each individual spectrum with a set of one - dimensional pure - hydrogen - atmosphere models and fitting procedure described in @xcite and references therein , which use ml2/@xmath50 .",
    "we found the weighted mean of these individual exposures , and used the 3d convective corrections of @xcite to determine the atmospheric parameters of epic229227292 to be @xmath0  = @xmath4k and @xmath2  = @xmath5 , corresponding to a mass of @xmath51 @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the best - fit atmosphere model is plotted over the spectroscopic data in figure  [ fig : spec ] to demonstrate the quality of the fit .",

    "these light curves provide a unique opportunity to immediately constrain the temperature distribution of outbursting white dwarfs .",

    "both pipelines mitigate for attitude corrections from _ k2 _  thruster firings , but in slightly different ways , and we include in table  [ tab : novoutb ] which pipeline we use for our outburst analysis .",
    "we have ensured that the apertures used enclose only the white dwarf target .",
    "many of these targets are very faint , with @xmath55mag , which is why we did not propose short - cadence observations of those with temperatures inside the empirical instability strip . however , _ k2 _  has proven itself stable enough to deliver useful long - cadence photometry on these faint targets ; a @xmath56mag target typically has roughly 1.2% r.m.s .",

    "we also rule out an asteroid or other contaminant moving through the photometric aperture during days @xmath73 by inspecting the raw pixel data with the k2flix visualization tool @xcite .",
    "we tentatively identify epic211891315 as a candidate outbursting dav .",

    ", it is by far the most energetic ever observed with an equivalent duration of 4.58hr , corresponding to an approximate total energy output of @xmath77erg .",
    "because the exposure time of long - cadence _ k2 _  light curves is much longer than typical dav pulsation periods , we followed this target up with high - speed photometry using the proem camera on the 2.1 m otto struve telescope at mcdonald observatory .",
    "we observed epic211891315 for 4hr on the night of 2015  december  17 with 14s exposures through a broadband @xmath78 filter , which cuts off light redward of 6000   to reduce sky noise .",
    "we obtained another 5hr of 10s exposures on 2015  december  18 through the @xmath78 filter .",
    "the frames were dark subtracted and flat - fielded with standard iraf tasks .",
    "aperture photometry was measured with the ccd_hsp package that utilizes iraf tasks from the phot package @xcite .",
    "we used the wqed software tools @xcite to divide the flux measured for the target by the normalized flux from comparison stars in the field to correct for transparency variations , then divided each night s light curve by a second - order polynomial to account for differential airmass effects on stars with different colors .",
    "we repeated this process using a range of circular aperture sizes and adopt the apertures that yield the highest signal - to - noise .",
    "the ft of these two nights of data is displayed in figure  [ fig : mcdft ] .    with a total of 9hr of ground - based , time - series photometry over two nights",
    ", we were able to cleanly prewhiten ( fit and subtract ) significant sinusoidal signals from these data .",
    "for this reason , we adopt a different significance criterion for this data set .",
    "we measure the mean local amplitude along the ft , @xmath45 , and use the standard 4@xmath45 significance threshold for single - site ground - based photometry @xcite .",
    "we identify significant signals through an iterative process of calculating the ft and significance threshold , prewhitening all significant peaks , then recalculating the ft and threshold for the prewhitened light curve .",
    "we repeat this until no additional significant peaks are identified .",
    "figure  [ fig : mcdft ] displays the fts of the original ( black ) and prewhitened ( red ) data with the final significance threshold and four significant frequencies marked .",
    "we establish epic211891315 as a new dav .",
    "the four significant pulsation modes that we detect have frequencies @xmath79 ( 2.22% amplitude ) , @xmath80 ( 1.99% ) , @xmath81 ( 1.19% ) , and @xmath82hz ( 1.12% ) .",
    "the confirmation of pulsations in this white dwarf provides marginal supporting evidence that the single brightening event during _ k2 _",
    "observations was a bona fide outburst .",
    "however , given the prevalence of systematic artifacts in the _ k2 _",
    "light curves of such faint targets , we are not comfortable confirming that epic211891315 is a new outbursting white dwarf , especially with only one event detected . additionally , the observed pulsations have overall much higher frequencies than what we have measured in the four confirmed outbursting davs , with a weighted mean period of 685.9s . for",
    "now , we classify epic211891315 as only a candidate outbursting white dwarf .",
    "the four confirmed members of the outbursting class of dav have three distinct commonalities : ( 1 ) repeated outbursts , recurring on irregular intervals of order days and lasting for several hours ; ( 2 ) effective temperatures that put them near the cool , red edge of the dav instability strip ; and ( 3 ) rich pulsation spectra dominated by low - frequency ( @xmath83s period ) pulsations that are unstable in amplitude / frequency with at least one stable mode at significantly higher frequency ( @xmath84s , and maybe as short as 290s ) , which in the first two cases appeared to be an @xmath85 from rotational splittings @xcite .",

    "spacecraft indicates that this is not an incredibly rare phenomenon .",
    "however , it does beg the question of how outbursts have been missed during the first 45 years of studies of pulsating white dwarfs .    in this context ,",
    "the minimum outburst duration observed offers a clue : so far , every outburst lasts for more than several hours .",
    "nearly all previous ground - based , time - series photometry of pulsating white dwarfs involves differential photometry : dividing the target by a ( usually redder ) comparison star to compensate for changing atmospheric conditions . due to color - dependent extinction effects ,",
    "nearly all groups have adopted a methodology of dividing out at least a second - order polynomial to normalize the light curves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is possible that outbursts were observed during previous ground - based studies of pulsating white dwarfs but were unintentionally de - trended from the data .",
    "notably , the dbv ( pulsating helium - atmosphere white dwarf ) gd 358 underwent a large - scale brightening event in 1996 , which may have been the first documented case of an outburst in a pulsating white dwarf @xcite .    the physical mechanism that causes outbursts",
    "remains an exciting open question .",
    "@xcite suggested that , following the theoretical framework laid out by @xcite , the outbursts could be the result of nonlinear three - mode resonant coupling . in this model",
    ", energy is transferred from an observed , overstable parent mode to daughter modes via parametric resonance , one or both of which may be damped by turbulence in the convection zone and deposit their newfound energy there .",
    "all four of the outbursting white dwarfs have some of the longest pulsation periods observed in davs , excluding the extremely low - mass white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "@xcite predicted that mode coupling would be most prevalent in the coolest white dwarfs with the longest - period pulsations , simply because there are more possible modes with which to couple .    by inspecting the light curves of the more than 300 spectroscopically confirmed da white dwarfs observed already by _",
    ", we have shown that outbursts only occur in a narrow temperature range , between roughly @xmath59k and @xmath60k .",
    "this temperature range falls just hot of the empirical red edge of the dav instability strip , below which pulsations are no longer observed .",
    "the red edge of the dav instability strip has been notoriously difficult to predict from nonadiabatic pulsation codes , which suggest that white dwarfs should have observable pulsations down to at least 6000k ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "there have been two proposed mechanisms to bring the theoretical red edge in line with observations .",
    "@xcite suggested that there is a critically maximal mode period , beyond which @xmath96-modes are no longer reflected off the outer mode cavity and thus evanesce .",
    "@xcite showed that applying this critical mode period for @xmath85 modes to the thermal timescale at the base of the convection zone can successfully reproduce the empirical red edge of the dav instability strip across a wide range of white dwarf masses .",
    "additionally , a series of papers by wu & goldreich proposed amplitude saturation mechanisms in the coolest davs from turbulent viscosity of the convection zone as well as resonant three - mode interactions as ways to cause a hotter red edge than nonadiabatic predictions @xcite . if outbursts are indeed caused by nonlinear mode coupling , this suggests amplitude saturation as an important contributor to the cessation of observability of pulsations in the coolest davs .",
    "the measured properties of outbursts provide observational leverage for efforts to understand pulsational mode selection and driving , especially in the context of the few short - period modes that are selected in all four of the outbursting davs . fortunately , dav pulsations are extremely sensitive to structural changes in white dwarfs , and our understanding of outbursts will benefit from further asteroseismic analysis of these objects that will be the subject of future work .    _",
