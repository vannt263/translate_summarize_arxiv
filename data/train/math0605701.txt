    "fix an isocrystal and the corresponding newton vector .",
    "mazur s inequality ( see  @xcite , pg.658 , and the group - theoretic generalization in  @xcite , theorem 4.2 ) states that , given a lattice in our isocrystal , the hodge vector associated to it is greater than or equal to the newton vector .",
    "conversely , any vector satisfying mazur s inequality is the hodge vector for some lattice ( see e.g.  @xcite , proposition 4.2 , and  @xcite , theorem 2 ) .",
    "the last result can be regarded as a statement for @xmath0 , but , in  @xcite ,  4 , r. kottwitz and m. rapoport formulated an analogous version for other groups and they proved it for @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "they also formulated a combinatorial statement involving respective root systems that would imply the converse to mazur s inequality in each case ( see also sections 4.3 and 4.4 in  @xcite , for a detailed version ) . c. lucarelli in  @xcite , theorem 0.2 , showed that this combinatorial statement is true ( see proposition [ cathy ] below ) , and therefore a converse to mazur s inequality was deduced , for all split classical groups .",
    "we prove this combinatorial statement for @xmath1 ( theorem a ) and hence deduce a converse to mazur s inequality for @xmath1 .",
    "we also generalize the combinatorial result for @xmath0 ( theorem b ) , which in particular gives a new and simple proof of the converse to mazur s inequality for @xmath0 .",
    "the results obtained here are proved using the theory of toric varieties .",
    "in fact , part of our aim is to show how the combinatorial result mentioned above can be naturally treated as a vanishing result for higher cohomology groups of certain line bundles on toric varieties associated to root systems ( theorems c and d on section [ resultssection ] ) , which improves the previously known results for these varieties .",
    "this raises the question of new vanishing results for toric varieties in general ( see  @xcite for work in this direction concerning toric varieties associated with root systems ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that these toric varieties , where the fan of the variety is the weyl fan , appear naturally in the work of group compactifications ( see e.g.  @xcite , pp.187206 , and references therein ) .    to give a flavor of the type of problem that we deal with here",
    ", it is very instructive to use a picture ( see below ) to illustrate the statement of theorem e for n=3 . consider a toric variety @xmath3 with initial lattice ( i.e. , lattice of co - characters ) @xmath4 and the fan consisting of six maximal cones as pictured below in dotted lines .",
    "the dual lattice ( of characters ) is @xmath5    let @xmath6 be a globally - generated torus - equivariant line bundle on @xmath7",
    ". then @xmath6 is completely determined by a set of characters ( one for each maximal cone in the fan ) , such that if @xmath8 and @xmath9 are two `` neighboring '' maximal cones , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are their corresponding characters , then @xmath12 , with respect to the canonical pairing of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , is perpendicular to the common face of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , non - negative on @xmath8 , and non - positive on @xmath9 .    this way @xmath6 determines a hexagon @xmath15 where the vertices of @xmath15 are the characters corresponding to @xmath6 , one for each maximal cone of the fan .",
    "( in our picture all these characters are distinct and we have a true hexagon , but in general we may get some degenerate version of @xmath15 , where some of the vertices coincide . ) then @xmath16 is given by the number of @xmath13-points in the convex hull @xmath17 of @xmath15 .",
    "note that @xmath17 lies in @xmath18 .",
    "this should explain why we are using dotted lines for the cones of our initial fan  they lie in the initial world , not the dual one .",
    "fix a root @xmath19 as in the picture .",
    "then the  line - segment \" @xmath20 corresponds to a ( non - torus - invariant ) divisor on @xmath7 .",
    "if we denote by @xmath21 the embedding @xmath22 , then @xmath23 equals the number of points that are both on @xmath20 and that are projections along the root @xmath19 of points in @xmath13 .",
    "our question is as follows : for any point @xmath24 on the line segment @xmath20 that is obtained by the projection along @xmath19 of some point @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is not necessarily in @xmath17 ) , can we always find a point @xmath27 that is in both @xmath13 and @xmath17 , and which maps to the initial point @xmath24 ?",
    "the answer is  yes \" and , because of the long - exact sequence @xmath28 where @xmath29 stands for the ideal sheaf of @xmath20 , it is equivalent to the statement that @xmath30 we should mention here that the above long - exact sequence has trivial entries to the right of @xmath31 , because higher cohomology groups vanish for globally - generated line bundles on complete toric varieties , and @xmath6 and @xmath32 are globally - generated on ( the complete toric varieties ) @xmath7 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "also , note that the map @xmath33 is induced by projecting along @xmath19 .    in this paper",
    "we precisely formulate the above question , using co - characters and co - roots , for a split connected reductive group @xmath34 over a finite extension of @xmath35 , or equivalently , by passing to the ( langlands ) complex dual world , using characters and roots , for the corresponding group @xmath36 over @xmath37 .",
    "then we reformulate the question using certain toric varieties associated to the root system of @xmath36 ( where the fan of our variety is the weyl fan and the dual lattice ( i.e. , lattice of characters ) is that of characters for @xmath36 ) .",
    "we answer the question in the affirmative for @xmath38 and for a weaker version ( where only line bundles @xmath6 arising from weyl orbits are considered ) for @xmath39 .",
    "as mentioned at the beginning , this type of combinatorial question , without reference to toric varieties , was investigated by kottwitz and rapoport ( and others ) .",
    "if we use the language of toric varieties to describe what they did , then they considered only globally generated line bundles @xmath6 arising from weyl - orbits , i.e. , where the corresponding polygon @xmath15 is a weyl - orbit for some element in the character lattice .",
    "let us now describe how our paper is organized .",
    "in the first section we introduce notation , set up the problem and state our main results ( theorems a through e ) .",
    "we also show that theorem c is equivalent to theorem a. sections 2 and 3 are devoted to some useful results in computing cohomology groups for line bundles on our toric varieties using the so - called piece - wise linear continuous functions on the support of the respective fans .",
    "we use these results in the next section , where we prove theorems b , d , and e , and where we show how e implies d and d implies b. finally , the last section is devoted to the proof of theorem c.

    "the non - trivial part is to show the other containment .",
    "it is important to mention that , while we believe that theorem a is also true for the rest of the exceptional groups , theorem b is probably only true for a split connected reductive group with irreducible components of dynkin diagram of type @xmath103 . more precisely , it is easy to construct counterexamples to theorem b for other classical groups and for the @xmath1 case . at the end of section 5",
    "we do so explicitly , but only for @xmath1 , since the construction for classical groups is completely analogous .",
    "we believe that the same construction should also provide counterexamples to theorem b for the other exceptional groups .",
    "the proof of these two theorems will involve the theory of toric varieties and we will freely use standard terminology and basic facts from this theory which appear in  @xcite . let us first make clear the correspondence between @xmath71-orthogonal sets and line bundles on a certain projective nonsingular toric variety @xmath104 , which we now define ; we follow the exposition in  @xcite ,  23 , and keep the same notation as above .",

    "let @xmath106 be the center of @xmath36 .",
    "then the fan of our toric variety @xmath104 is the weyl fan in @xmath107 and the torus is @xmath108 .",
    "( we would like to remark that the toric variety @xmath104 appears naturally in the theory of group compactifications ",
    "see e.g.  @xcite , pp.187206 . )",
    "clearly @xmath108 acts on @xmath104 , but we are interested in the action of @xmath105 on @xmath104 . the latter action is obtained using the canonical surjection @xmath109 and the action of @xmath108 on @xmath104 .    as with any toric variety , there is a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath105-orbits in @xmath104 and cones in the fan of @xmath104 . in our case , because the fan is the weyl fan , this means that we have a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath105-orbits in @xmath104 and parabolic subgroups of @xmath34 that contain @xmath44 .",

    "it is very important for us to note that there is a one - to - one correspondence between isomorphism classes of @xmath105-equivariant line bundles on @xmath104 and @xmath71-orthogonal sets in @xmath47 ( see e.g.  @xcite ,  23.1 ) .",
    "we describe the map that gives this correspondence .",

    "in this way , for every borel subgroup @xmath43 ( containing @xmath44 ) we get a character @xmath113 , i.e. , a co - character @xmath114 .",
    "the fact that @xmath90 is a @xmath71-orthogonal set comes from the fact that the characters defining @xmath6 must agree on the overlaps .",
    "a very useful remark is that positive @xmath71-orthogonal sets correspond to line bundles on @xmath104 which are generated by their sections , and hence their higher cohomology groups vanish .",
    "this last result follows from the more general fact that if the support of the fan ( i.e. , the union of all the cones in the fan ) of a toric variety is a convex set , then the higher cohomology groups vanish for line bundles ( on this variety ) which are generated by their sections ( see e.g.  @xcite , pg.74 ) .",
    "remember that we are trying to reformulate theorems a and b in terms of toric varieties ; we have already described the toric analog of @xmath71-orthogonal sets ; the map @xmath115 corresponds to the map @xmath116 where @xmath117 stands for the root lattice for @xmath111 ( note that the codomain of the last map is just @xmath118 ) ; now we need to describe the toric analog of @xmath80-orthogonal sets .",
    "we continue to have the same notation .",
    "then for @xmath46 as above ( a levi subgroup containing @xmath44 ) , we will need a toric variety @xmath119 for the torus @xmath120 ( see e.g.  @xcite ,  23.2 ) .",
    "first assume that the group @xmath36 is adjoint ; we can do this since the center of @xmath121 in @xmath122 is equal to @xmath120 ) .",
    "then @xmath123 is a subtorus of @xmath105 and so @xmath124 is a subgroup of @xmath125 .",
    "the collection of cones from the weyl fan inside @xmath126 that lie in the subspace @xmath127 gives a fan .",
    "this is the fan for the complete , nonsingular , projective toric variety @xmath119 .",
    "now we go back to the general case where we no longer assume that @xmath36 is adjoint .",
    "denote by @xmath128 the simply connected cover of the derived group of @xmath34 and by @xmath129 the levi subgroup in @xmath128 that is obtained as the inverse image of @xmath46 under the map @xmath130 .",
    "then we have that @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 . from the adjoint case",
    ", we can define the toric variety @xmath134 for @xmath133 .",
    "we can therefore view @xmath134 as a space on which @xmath123 acts using the canonical map @xmath135 .",
    "it is this toric variety , which sits inside @xmath104 as a closed @xmath123-stable subspace , that we denote by @xmath119 .    as with the toric variety @xmath104 , it is easily seen that",
    "@xmath123-fixed points in @xmath119 are in one - to - one correspondence with parabolic subgroups of @xmath34 that admit @xmath46 as a levi component .",
    "also , there is a one - to - one correspondence between isomorphism classes of @xmath123-equivariant line bundles on @xmath119 and @xmath80-orthogonal sets in @xmath63 .",
    "this correspondence is defined is the same way as the one for @xmath104 ( see e.g.  @xcite ,  23.4 ) .",
    "we note that ( see e.g.  @xcite ,  23.4 ) restricting a @xmath105-equivariant line bundle @xmath6 on @xmath104 to @xmath119 corresponds the procedure described earlier in this section of obtaining a @xmath80-orthogonal set ( the one corresponding to the restriction @xmath136 ) from a @xmath71-orthogonal set ( the one corresponding to @xmath6 ) .",
    "let us now assume that our parabolic subgroup @xmath15 is of semisimple rank 1 .",
    "this implies that the root lattice @xmath117 is just @xmath137 for a unique , up to a sign , root @xmath19 of @xmath36 , and that the toric variety @xmath119 , which we now denote by @xmath20 , is a non - torus - invariant divisor in @xmath104 .",
    "the map @xmath115 will now be denoted by @xmath138 . by tensoring with @xmath64",
    "we get a map from @xmath138 , which we still denote by @xmath139 since tensoring with @xmath64 will loose any possible torsion , we can identify the codomain of the last map with the co - root hyperplane @xmath140 : = \\{x \\in   x^*(\\hat{t})\\otimes_{\\mathbb{z}}\\mathbb{r } : \\langle \\alpha^{\\vee},x \\rangle = 0   \\ } , \\ ] ] where @xmath141 is the canonical pairing between co - characters and characters , and @xmath76 stands for the co - root of @xmath36 corresponding to @xmath19 .",
    "we will therefore say that the map @xmath138 is the projection along @xmath19 onto the co - root hyperplane @xmath142 $ ] .",
    "also , the fan of @xmath20 is contained in the root hyperplane @xmath143 : = \\ { x \\in x_*(\\hat{t } ) \\otimes_{\\mathbb{z}}\\mathbb{r } : \\langle x , \\alpha \\rangle = 0 \\}.\\ ] ]    now let @xmath6 be a @xmath105- line bundle on @xmath104 that is generated by its sections .",
    "then we have a short - exact sequence of sheaves on @xmath104 : @xmath144 where @xmath29 is the ideal sheaf of @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the inclusion map @xmath145 . note that @xmath146=0 , for all @xmath147 , since @xmath6 is generated by its sections and @xmath104 is projective , and also @xmath148 for all @xmath147 , since @xmath32 is generated by its sections and @xmath20 is a projective toric variety .",

    "we explain in section [ proof of theorem b ] how the general case is handled , but here let us just show , using a similar method used there , how theorem d , i.e. surjectivity of @xmath33 , implies theorem b for all @xmath169 , where @xmath170 and only one of @xmath171 s is equal to 2 and the rest are equal to 1 .",

    "it suffices to find a point @xmath26 in @xmath429 such that @xmath439 .",
    "first `` shift '' the orthogonal set @xmath423 by @xmath440 , i.e. , consider the orthogonal set @xmath441 , which gives a new divisor @xmath259 on @xmath104 . then ,",

    "note that @xmath444 lies in the intersection of the image of the set @xmath445 under the map @xmath138 and the set @xmath446 .",

    "( we remind the reader that here , as before , we are considering @xmath65 as a subspace of @xmath66 . )",
    "the simplest case is when only one of @xmath171 s is equal to 2 and the rest are equal to 1 , but we saw in section [ resultssection ] how theorem b is deduced from theorem d in that case .",
    "now assume that only two of the @xmath171 s are equal to 2 and the rest equal 1 .",
    "we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath458 and @xmath459 , with @xmath460 .",

    "now we see that @xmath115 is the composition @xmath469 and we get our desired conclusion again using theorem d.    in general we write @xmath115 as a composition of a finite number of @xmath138 s for distinct roots @xmath19 and then apply theorem d as many times as there are roots @xmath19 appearing in that composition . if we want to be very specific , then , for @xmath169 we can see that @xmath115 agrees with the composition of maps @xmath470 where @xmath471 with the convention @xmath472 .",
    "this concludes the proof of theorem b.",
    "consider @xmath104 for @xmath473 . just as in the case of @xmath474",
    ", we would like to describe the fan @xmath187 of @xmath7 . but",
    "first , the initial lattice is @xmath475 and so the dual one is @xmath476 .",
    "identify the rays in @xmath187 with their corresponding minimal lattice points .",
    "then @xmath274 consists of twelve points : @xmath477 and @xmath478 , for @xmath479 .",
    "there are twelve maximal cones : @xmath297 , @xmath480 , where the rays of @xmath297 are @xmath481 and @xmath482 ( with @xmath483 ) .",
    "let @xmath192 be a @xmath105-cartier divisor on @xmath7 corresponding to a weyl orbit ( see section [ resultssection ] for the precise definition ) and @xmath19 a root of @xmath36 .",
    "for every maximal cone @xmath297 denote by @xmath296 the character corresponding to the divisor @xmath192 .",
    "obviously , @xmath296 s form a positive orthogonal set .",
    "we want to prove that @xmath484 this is true if the orthogonal set corresponding to @xmath192 is _ strictly positive _ , i.e. , if @xmath296 s are distinct and they form a positive orthogonal set . indeed ,",
    "use lemma [ dalpha2 ] and the definition of orthogonal sets to conclude that the orthogonal set corresponding to @xmath298 is still positive ( but not necessarily strictly positive ) , i.e. , @xmath485 is globally generated .",
    "it is also obvious that if all @xmath296 s are equal to each other , then we get a degenerate case for which the result is true as well .",
    "therefore the only problem might arise if only some but not all of the @xmath296 s are the same . using symmetries of the current root system , there are only four cases we need to consider , two for a short root and two for a long root :    * @xmath486 and there exists a natural number @xmath74 so that @xmath487 @xmath488 @xmath489 * @xmath490 and there exists a natural number @xmath74 so that @xmath487 @xmath488 @xmath489 * @xmath486 and there exists a natural number @xmath74 so that @xmath491 @xmath492 @xmath493 * @xmath490 and there exists a natural number @xmath74 so that @xmath491 @xmath492 @xmath494    let us mention again that we want to prove that @xmath263 . as we explained in section [ resultssection ]",
    ", we have a long - exact sequence @xmath495 where terms on the right vanish because @xmath496 is generated by its sections .",
    "therefore it suffices to prove that @xmath33 is surjective in each of the cases above .",
    "case ( a ) : we have that ( cf .  @xcite , pg.66 ) @xmath497 where @xmath498 . also , @xmath499 where @xmath500\\cap { \\mathbb{z}}\\}$ ] . the map @xmath33 is given by @xmath501 , where @xmath502 .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath181 is even , we have @xmath503 and @xmath504 .",

    "but this is easily seen to be true by checking that @xmath509 , where @xmath510 s are the respective primitive lattice points along the rays of our fan @xmath187 , written explicitly at the beginning of this section .",
    "case ( b ) : keeping the same notation as in case ( a ) we now have that @xmath511 \\cap { \\mathbb{z}}\\}$ ] .",
    "@xmath33 is given by @xmath512 , where @xmath513 . if @xmath181 is even then @xmath514 and @xmath33 fixes @xmath515 .",
    "if @xmath181 is odd then we have that @xmath516 it is an easy calculation to see that for all odd @xmath181 between @xmath517 and @xmath518 we get @xmath519 and therefore @xmath33 is surjective , which we wanted to prove .",
    "case ( c ) : this time we have @xmath520 \\cap { \\mathbb{z}}\\}$ ] and @xmath33 is the same as in case ( a ) . clearly @xmath521 is in @xmath429 and @xmath522 is fixed by @xmath33 , whenever @xmath181 is even . if @xmath181 is odd then consider @xmath523 , which is easily seen to lie in @xmath429 .",
    "@xmath33 is surjective because it maps @xmath524 to @xmath522 .",
    "case ( d ) : in our final case , we have @xmath525 \\cap { \\mathbb{z}}\\}$ ] .",
    "@xmath33 is the same as in case ( b ) and it fixes @xmath515 for @xmath181 even . clearly @xmath514 and it is not difficult to see that if @xmath181 is odd then @xmath526 as well . moreover , still for @xmath181 odd , @xmath527 hence @xmath33 is surjective .",
    "we would like to note that the proof of theorem d was different from that of theorem c because in the former we used _ all _ positive orthogonal sets whereas in the latter we only used some and not all positive orthogonal sets , namely only the weyl - orbit ones . more concretely , in section 3 , after lemma [ importantlemma ] , we saw that the vanishing of the first cohomology group there was implied by the vanishing of its corresponding 0-eigenspace ( under the action of our torus ) .",
    "this is not true for @xmath39 .",
    "the crucial step was to note that by  shifting \" a positive orthogonal set , say @xmath261 , by a character , say , @xmath157 , we get a positive orthogonal set @xmath260 ; however , it is clear that a shift of a weyl - orbit is in general not a weyl - orbit .      at the very end , we give an example to show that theorem b fails in the case of @xmath1 .",
    "consider @xmath528 and let @xmath529 .",
    "let @xmath192 be the positive orthogonal set ( i.e. , the globally generated torus - equivariant divisor on @xmath528 ) given by @xmath530 for @xmath531 and @xmath532 for @xmath533 .",
    "following the same notation as before , we see that in our case @xmath534 and @xmath535 therefore @xmath536 , but @xmath537 .",
    "hence the map @xmath538 , induced by the projection @xmath138 along @xmath19 , is not surjective , and theorem b is no longer true if we put @xmath1 instead of @xmath0 .",
