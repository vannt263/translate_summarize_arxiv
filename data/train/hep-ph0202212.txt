    "one of the many puzzles remaining in the current phenomenology of particle physics is to understand the smallness of the masses ( @xmath6 ev ) of standard neutrinos @xmath7 and @xmath8 , compared to those of charged leptons .",
    "if neutrinos are of a dirac nature , nonzero masses could be obtained in the standard model ( sm ) by introduction of ( sterile ) right  handed neutrinos . on the other hand , if neutrinos are of a majorana nature , more appealing solutions to the small neutrino mass problem exist . in order to avoid the explicit breaking of the sm gauge symmetry and still obtain nonzero majorana mass terms ( via spontaneous symmetry breaking ) , an additional higgs triplet is needed in the sm .",

    "another possible solution was investigated in the framework of heterotic superstring models  @xcite with @xmath1 symmetry or certain scenarios of @xmath0 models  @xcite , where the low  energy effective theories include new left  handed and right  handed neutral isosinglets and assume conservation of total lepton number in the yukawa sector .",
    "one possibility to test the neutrino sector lies in the study and measurement of lepton  flavor  violating ( lfv ) processes , e.g. , @xmath9 or @xmath10 ; @xmath11 or @xmath12 ; @xmath13 or @xmath10 .",
    "such processes are practically suppressed to zero in the sm , due to the unitarity of the leptonic analog of the ckm mixing matrix and the near masslessness of the three neutrinos .",

    "to set up our notation , we briefly review the two models in question : we call model i the sm with the addition of right  handed neutrinos ( singlets under the gauge group ) and with the seesaw mechanism involved , and model ii the sm with the addition of both left  handed and right  handed neutral singlets",
