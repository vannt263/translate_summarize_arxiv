    "they show many features at the resolution limit implying the existence of unresolved structure .",
    "for example , the power spectrum of the penumbral images have power up to the instrumental cutoff @xcite , and the width of the narrower penumbral filaments is set by the resolution of the observation ( @xcite ; see also fig .",

    "this description also provides a fair account of the actual observation ( see fig .",

    "the magnetostatic equilibrium along field lines also favors dark regions with large field strengths as argued by , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "[ roll1 ] the stable sunspots are surrounded by a large annular convection cell called moat @xcite .",
    "the moat presents an outflow which , contrarily to the commonly held opinion , has both radial and tangential velocities ( title 2003 , private communication ; @xcite ) .",
    "the tangential component is well organized so that it sweeps the plasma toward radial channels , creating a velocity pattern that resembles the convective rolls by @xcite .",

    "[ ncp ] the polarization of the spectral lines emerging from any sunspot has asymmetries , i.e. , they have to be produced in atmospheres with several velocities and magnetic fields per resolution element @xcite .",

    "ncp can only be produced by gradients along the line - of - sight  and , therefore , within a range of heights smaller that the region where the lines are formed ( say , 150  km ) .",
    "the ncp follows several general rules found by @xcite and @xcite , and summarized in @xcite ; it has the sign of the sunspot polarity and the maximum occurs at the limb - side penumbra where the stokes @xmath1 profiles are extremely asymmetric with three or more lobes . recently",

    "we are forced to conclude that the penumbral filaments can not be tracing individual fluxtubes . if arrays of fluxtubes form the filaments , they must be arranged with their cold and hot footpoints aligned to form the observed structures . 14 .",

    "the motions along magnetic field lines are driven by magnetic field strength differences between the two footpoints , as required by the siphon flow mechanism .",
    "in addition to the large velocities along field lines , the cold footpoint sinks down while the hot footpoint rises . this produces a backward and sideways displacement of the visible part of the loop ( see fig .",

    "the properties of the loops ( length , width , speed , and so on ) should change depending on the position on the penumbra , but they would tend to be narrow and so optically - thin across field lines . since they are optically - thin , one does not detect individual loops but assembles of them interleaved along the line - of - sight .",

    "the scenario described in   [ scenario ] seems to fit in the observations in   [ observations ] plus the return of magnetic flux and mass flow in sa05 .",
    "this section points out why .",
    "the items mentioned along the text refer to those numbered in   [ observations ] .",
    "the model penumbra is covered by narrow loops whose length is typically smaller than the penumbral size ( fig .",
    "[ cartoon2 ] ) and whose widths are not spatially resolved , in agreement with item  #  [ best ] .",
    "consequently , magnetic field lines emerge and return to the sub - photosphere over the entire penumbra , as inferred in sa05 .",
    "the loops have a hot footpoint with upward motion and a cold footpoint with downward motion , in agreement with the local correlation between brightness and upward velocity observed in penumbrae ( item  #  [ correlation ] ) .",
    "the downflows are expected to be faster than the upflows since they are accelerated by the magnetic field difference between the two footpoints , an image that also fits in well the observations showing the largest velocities to be associated with the dark penumbral components ( item  #  [ horizontal ] ) and with the strongest magnetic field strengths ( sa05 ; item  #  [ contradict ] ) .",

    "[ cartoon1 ] .",
    "they trace downdrafts engulfing the cold footpoints of the loops ( item  #  [ drag ] ) .",
    "the bright filaments around the dark cores would be naturally explained by the presence of the downflows , as it happens with the enhanced brightness at the borders of the granules in non - magnetic convection . when the downdrafts reach sub - photospheric depths , they displace hot material next to them .",
    "this hot material tends to rise to satisfy mass conservation , and it produces an upflow of hot material around the downdrafts @xcite .",
    "the same mechanism would produce the uprise of hot ( magnetized ) material around the cores , forming two bright filaments outlining each dark core ( item  #  [ cores ] ; fig .",
    "[ coresfig ] ) .",
    "the hot magnetized material would eventually cool down and sink into the downdraft to re - start the process .",
    "in other words , a dark core would be the downdraft of two paired convective rolls , resembling the convective rolls proposed by danielson ( item  #  [ roll1 ] ) . in this case",
    ", however , the plasma also has a large velocity component along the field lines .",
    "note that this hypothetical convective rolls reproduce the expected mode of convective transport in highly inclined magnetic fields ( item  #  [ roll2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , a pattern of motions similar to these convective rolls occurs in the moat surrounding the sunspot ( item  #  [ roll1 ] ) , and it is conceivable that it continues within the sunspot .",

    "[ light ] would be a scaled up version of the doubly convective rolls that we are proposing as building blocks for the penumbral structure ( item  #  [ light_bridge ] ) .",

    "this distribution matches the cartoon in fig .",
    "[ cartoon1 ] .",
    "the magnetic field lines of the loops converge toward the dark lanes ( fig .",
    "[ cartoon1 ] ) , which would demand an increase of the magnetic field strength in the cores .",
    "this is indeed consistent with our scenario , and it would be responsible for the gas pressure difference driving the evershed flow along the field lines ( see above ) .    the existence of small scale convective upflows and downflows in penumbra does not contradict the systematic upward motions in the inner penumbra and downward motions in the outer penumbra found by various authors ( see item  #  [ up_down ] ) .",
    "most techniques employed so far assume uniform velocities in the resolution element .",
    "when spatially unresolved upflows and downflows are interpreted as a single resolved component , the _ measured _ velocity corresponds to an ill - defined mean of the actual velocities .",
    "the contribution of upflows and downflows to the mean is not proportional to the mass going up and down .",
    "it depends on the physical properties of the upflows and downflows , as well as on the method employed to measure . the mean vertical flux of mass inferred by sa05is null . however , the average is biased so that if shows net upflows in the inner penumbra and net downflows in the outer penumbra , in agreement with existing observations .",
    "this scenario with overlaying loops with various velocities and inclinations satisfies the rules of the net circular polarization described in item  #  [ ncp ] , as worked out by sa05 .",
    "the bright filaments are more opaque than the dark cores , and they tend to block the cores when the filaments are observed from a side .",
    "this depression of the dark cores explains why penumbrae are slightly darker in the line along the radial direction from the solar disk center ( item  #  [ this ] ) .",
    "the length of the bright filaments is not set by the cooling time of individual fluxtubes , which avoids the difficulty posed in item  #  [ cooling ] .",
    "it is given by the length of the dark core , i.e. , the length of a sheet - like downdraft or the length of a radially oriented chain of many small downdrafts .",
    "the radiative flux emanating from a penumbra @xmath14 is some 75% of the solar flux ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the density and occupation fraction are representative of the upflows in the inversion by sa05 , whereas @xmath20 is taken from @xcite can not be much larger that the value adopted above .",
    "a maximum is set by the energy corresponding to one recombination event per existing h particle , i.e. , the h ionization potential divided by the mass per h particle , which equals some @xmath22  erg  g@xmath10 . ] .",
    "if the transport of energy in penumbrae is due to convective motions , then there should be a sizeable vertical velocity of hot plasma over the entire penumbra , as indicated by equation  ( [ vert_veloc ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the vertical velocities for the upward moving component in sa05are one order of magnitude smaller than the speed in equation ( [ vert_veloc ] ) .",
    "( the same happens with the vertical velocities discussed in item  #  [ correlation ] . )",
    "the above back - of - the - envelop estimate shows that the upflows and downflows in sa05do not transport enough mass to account for the penumbral radiative loss .",
    "a possible way out would be the existence of a bias that underestimates the true velocities .",
    "this bias is to be expected in measurements which do not distinguish between unresolved component , e.g. , those leading to the results discussed in item  #  [ up_down ] ( see appendix  [ appa ] ) .",
    "the reason for a bias in sa05  is more uncertain , but could be due to a misinterpretation of bulk upward and and downward motions as turbulent motions . actually , micro - turbulence in excess of 1  km   is not uncommon in sa05",
    ".    if this bias is present , the observed vertical velocities in sunspots must increase upon improvement of the angular resolution , a conjecture that can be tested with instrumentation now available .",
    "keep in mind , however , that the true velocity signal would be severely damped unless the velocity pattern is spatially resolved ( appendix  [ appa ] ) .",
    "if the scenario advocated in the paper turns out to be correct , the detection of sizeable upflows and downflows requires a spatial resolution comparable with the size of the bright penumbral filaments with dark cores found by @xcite .      we have been arguing by analogy with the non - magnetic convection , where the ( negative ) buoyancy forces in the intergranular lanes are the driving force .",
    "the plasma tends to sink down due to its reduced density as compared to the hot upwelling plasma .",
    "the scenario for the penumbral convection discussed above does not reproduce this particular aspect of the granular convection .",
    "the descending footpoint has reduced density as compared to the upflowing footpoint .",
    "the density in the descending leg is lower than in the ascending leg , and one may think that the descending plasma is buoyant .",
    "however , the density of the cold leg has to be compared to the local density in the downdraft , which can easily be larger than the downdraft density .",
    "recall that the downdrafts have low temperature and high magnetic field strengths , two ingredients that naturally produce low densities in a magneto - hydrostatic equilibrium ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "according to our conjecture , the dark cores or penumbral lanes are not tracing individual field lines .",
    "they are faults in the global structure of the sunspot where downflow motions are easier .",
    "such discontinuities of the global magnetic structure would be favored if they are aligned with the mean magnetic field , as it happen with the interchange instabilities , which have an old tradition in the sunspot literature @xcite .",
    "the dark cores would be oriented along the direction of the mean penumbral magnetic field .",
    "the scenario that we have assembled owes much of its properties to various model for the penumbral structure and the evershed effect existing in the literature .",
    "the model that emerges is very much like the return flux model of @xcite , where the field lines forming umbra and penumbra differ because the former are open whereas the latter return to the photosphere .",
    "the penumbral field lines are forced to return to the photosphere due to the expansion of the umbral fields . the return flux is included in our scenario , except that the return of penumbral field -lines occurs throughout the penumbra , rather than outside the sunspot border .",
    "the siphon flow model for the evershed effect by @xcite precedes all further modeling that assume several magnetic components with different magnetic fields and velocities coexisting in the penumbra . quoting @xcite , _ ... in the penumbra we have two different sets of magnetic flux tubes side by side . a small fraction",
    "are elements lying very low in the solar atmosphere and presumably starting with very small inclination angles .",
    "the larger fraction carrying most of the observed magnetic flux reaches up high into the atmosphere and would display no flow velocity at all . _",
    "the flows are accelerated by gas pressure differences between the penumbra and magnetic concentrations outside the sunspot . in the latest version of the model @xcite , the loops are fairly high ( 200350 km above @xmath23 ) and short ( less than 1.5  mm ) , and some returns within the penumbral boundary .",
    "the loops require an external force that keeps the two foot points anchored to sustain the equilibrium of the arch .",
    "this force has been recently attributed to the drag of downflowing plumes in the granular convection outside the sunspot @xcite . in our scenario",
    "the magnetic field aligned flows are also siphon flows .",
    "the length of the loops is also small so that descending footpoints are often in the penumbrae .",
    "the difference of magnetic field between the hot and cold penumbral components drives the evershed flow .",
    "our scenario includes ( slow ) motions across field lines from the hot to the cold penumbral filaments .",
    "the downflowing footpoints are continuously pumped down by the drag of magnetic downdrafts within the penumbra , rather than outside the sunspot .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "interchange convection was put forward as a mechanism of energy transport by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the transfer is produce by uplifting hot fluxtubes from the magnetopause to the photosphere , where they cool down releasing energy .",
    "it has been modeled in detail by @xcite and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the uplifting of hot magnetic fluxtubes is due to a convective instability ( hot and so lightweight fluxtubes tend to rise ) . in our case , however , the presence of vigorous downdrafts and the conservation of mass force hot material to rise next to the downdraft , producing bright filaments surrounding the dark cores .",
    "as far as the similarities with the interchange convection is concerned , we also have strong flows along field lines , with the mass cooling down as it radiates away .",
    "the differences being the length of the arches ( shorter in our scenario ) , and the submergence of the cold footpoint , which does return to the solar sub - photosphere in the penumbra .",
    "( these differences are not so obvious for the sea - serpent fluxtube in @xcite . )    again some of the aspects of our scenario are similar to the convective rolls discussed by @xcite . in our case , however , we have strong motions along field lines . moreover , it is not clear whether the submerging footpoint will return to the photosphere in a cyclic motions like the original @xcite s rolls .",
    "it may be closer to the paradigm in non - magnetic convection @xcite , which is highly non - local with strong downdrafts connecting many different pressure scale heights , and where only a small fraction of the rising hot material actually reaches the photosphere .",
    "the degree of similarity would be established only when a realistic numerical mhd modeling of the process is available .",
    "we describe a penumbral magnetic field formed by short magnetic loops most of which return to the sub - photosphere within the sunspot boundary ( fig .  [ cartoon2 ] ) .",
    "matter flowing along magnetic field lines would give rise to the evershed effect .",
    "this flow along field lines would also be responsible for the convective transport of heat in penumbrae .",

    "it is also akin to the interchange convection ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where flows along field lines transport heat from below and give rise to the evershed effect phenomena . in our case , however , the uprise of the hot tubes is induced by the presence of downdrafts and the need to satisfy mass conservation ( as in the non - magnetic granular convection , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this downdrafts pump down the cool footpoints of the loops as numerical models have shown to occur with the downdrafts outside the penumbra @xcite .",

    "a gas pressure difference between the loop footpoints drives the flows , but this difference is set by the magnetic field strength difference between the hot and the cold penumbral fibrils , rather than from differences between the penumbra and magnetic concentrations around the sunspot .",
    "this scenario seems to be compatible with most observations existing in the literature , in particular , the ubiquitous downflows and the return of magnetic flux found by sa05  ( see   [ qua_obs ] ) .",
    "however , a difficulty remains .",
    "the upflows and downflows found by sa05  are not fast enough to transport the flux of radiation emanating from penumbrae (   [ not_enough ] ) . a way out would be a bias in the observations .",
    "insufficient spatial resolution leads to the cancellation of upflows and downflows and provides only a small residual (   [ observations ] ) .",
    "fortunately , the presence of sizeable upflows and downflows in the penumbra is a conjecture that can be tested .",
    "large upflows and downflows must show up upon improving of the angular resolution .",
    "several specific tests which will allow to confirm or falsify our scenario are :    * diffraction limited high resolution spectroscopy with 1-meter class telescopes must show a correlation between brightness and velocity .",
    "the sign of the correlation can not change from the center - side penumbra to the limb - side penumbra .",
    "( this correlation is actually observed ; see item  #  [ correlation ] in   [ observations ] . increasing the angular resolution would increase the amplitude of the flows up to a velocity of the order of 1  km  s@xmath10 ;   [ not_enough ] . ) * the molecular spectra trace the cold penumbral component ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "they should show a global downflow of the order of 1  km  s@xmath10 , no matter the angular resolution of the observation .",
    "* high angular resolution longitudinal magnetograms in sunspots close to the solar disk center should show both positive and negative polarities .",
    "in particular , the dark cores are associated with magnetic field lines returning to the sub - photosphere and , therefore , they should have a polarity opposite to the umbra . *",
    "local correlation tracking techniques @xcite applied to series of penumbral images should reveal bright features moving toward dark filaments .",
    "such motion is masked by the tendency of the bright plasma to become dark and transparent as it approaches a dark core .",
    "a global trend is to be expected , though .",
    "such trend seems to be present in high resolution penumbral images @xcite .",
    "most of the penumbra observed by @xcite does not show obvious dark cores ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ narrow ] ) , which implies that many cores are probably not spatially resolved with the present angular resolution .",
    "the observed ones represent large and lonely specimens among the family of penumbral downdrafts .",
    "resolving the smallest ones is not only a question of improving the angular resolution .",
    "they are probably close to the optically - thin limit , where the radiative transfer smearing modulates and reduces the contrast between hot upflows and cold downflows .",
    "we conjecture that the light bridges ( lb ) are scaled up versions of the basic building blocks forming the penumbral structures ( two paired convective rolls sharing a single downdraft ;   [ scenario ] ) .",
    "the magnetic micro - structure may be larger in these lbs since the presence of aligned bright points and dark lanes is not so elusive as the dark cores in penumbral filaments ( fig .",
    "[ light ] ) .",
    "if the lb magnetic structure is larger , the observations to falsify our penumbral scenario may be simpler to try with lbs and so , they represent an ideal target for a first trial .    in a paper for non - specialists",
    ", @xcite speculates _ are the bright filaments doubly convective rolls with a dark core that are cooling and sinking ? _ this question seems to advance the scenario advocated here .",
    "our paper took form during a short visit paid to the observatory of meudon , france , thanks to the kind invitation of c. briand .",
