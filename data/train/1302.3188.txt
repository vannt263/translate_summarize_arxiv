    "recently , narrowband fluorescent nanodiamonds ( nds ) harnessing the photoluminescence of silicon vacancy ( siv ) centers have attracted research interest due to their promising applications as single photon sources as well as fluorescence labels for in vivo imaging.@xcite for the application as single photon sources , siv centers stand out owing to high brightness , narrow bandwidth single photon emission : single photon rates up to 6 mcps have been reported .",
    "simultaneously , the fluorescence predominantly concentrates in the narrow purely electronic transition , i.e. , the zero - phonon - line ( zpl ) with down to 0.7 nm width at room temperature.@xcite for the application as fluorescence labels , siv centers are promising as they enable optical excitation using red laser light ( e.g. , at 671 nm ) combined with fluorescence in the near - infrared spectral range at approx .  738 nm.@xcite both properties aid to minimize absorption in biological tissue as well as tissue autofluorescence;@xcite additionally , the narrow bandwidth enables efficient spectral filtering of fluorescence and background signal . in ref .",
    ", we reported the production of an aqueous , colloidal solution of siv containing nds from polycrystalline chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) diamond films using the bead assisted sonic disintegration ( basd ) method ( see refs .  ) .",
    "these siv containing nds in solution are promising for applications as fluorescence labels as well as single photon sources .",
    "however , some essential characteristics of the siv fluorescence in basd nds have not been investigated to date .    in the context of single photon sources ,",
    "the feasible positioning of nds in solution by nano - manipulation techniques is advantageous : it enables the coupling to photonic nano - structures , e.g. , dielectric resonator structures to build enhanced single photon sources.@xcite to reach efficient coupling of a defect center to a resonator mode , spectral overlap of the resonator mode and the color center s emission line has to be ensured.@xcite cooling of the color center generally reduces the emission linewidth and thus potentially enhances the spectral overlap of an emission line with a narrow resonator mode of a high q cavity .",
    "however , the cooling also induces a spectral shift of the zpl.@xcite thus , knowledge of the zpl shift as well as the temperature dependent linewidth is crucial to ensure spectral overlap at the targeted temperature when coupling color centers to resonator structures . for siv centers in basd nds , neither temperature dependent linewidths nor lineshifts have been investigated to date .",
    "second , the polarization of single photons emitted from a color center is crucial , e.g. , in quantum key distribution applications ( ref .  ) or for the frequency conversion of single photons.@xcite at cryogenic temperature , the zpl of the siv center splits into 4 fine - structure components.@xcite however , the polarization properties of these line components have not been reported in the literature in contrast to the room temperature polarization properties.@xcite    third , for single photon sources as well as fluorescence labels , spectrally and temporally stable fluorescence emission is essential .",
    "therefore , stabilizing the desired charge state of the color center , corresponding to defined luminescence properties , is crucial . for nitrogen vacancy color centers in nds",
    ", it has been shown that the charge state critically depends on the surface termination of the nds.@xcite nevertheless , no data on the dependence of siv luminescence in nds on the surface termination is reported in the literature . using heating in air ( oxidation ) ,",
    "amorphous carbon and graphitic shells can be preferentially removed before the @xmath0 bonded diamond core of the nd is reduced.@xcite at 400430 @xmath1c , @xmath2 bonded carbon can be etched without loss of diamond even for diamond nanoparticles.@xcite simultaneously , the surface is covered with oxygen containing functional groups such as carboxyl and carbonyl groups.@xcite at higher temperatures , diamond can be etched away and the nds can be reduced in size : at 500 @xmath1c , hpht nds with about 60 nm size are etched at a rate of 1 nm / hour.@xcite however , the etch rate strongly depends on the crystallographic direction.@xcite furthermore , smaller diamonds get etched or even destroyed at lower temperature ( see ref .   for work on detonation nds ) . in the present work ,",
    "we use air oxidation to remove damaged regions from the surface and establish a defined surface termination of the basd nds .",
    "we investigate the effects of the surface treatment via raman spectroscopy and we observe the reaction of the siv center luminescence to the same treatments .",
    "we furthermore address the crucial topics introduced above : temperature dependent linewidth and position as well as the polarization of the zpl components .",
    "the investigated nds have been described in detail in ref .  .",
    "they are obtained via the basd method from a polycrystalline cvd diamond film grown on a si substrate .",
    "siv centers are created _ in situ _ as a result of the etching of the si substrate and subsequent incorporation of si into the growing diamond .",

    "the error is obtained as the standard deviation of the width and position measured on different spots on the dropcast sample . to obtain the width ,",
    "a lorentzian fit has been used .",
    "the observation of a raman line shifted only by 0.5 @xmath4 to higher frequency compared to the case of single crystal diamond witnesses a low absolute ( compressive ) stress in the diamonds ( see , e.g. , ref .  )",
    "whereas the broadening of the line indicates the stress distribution.@xcite however , the raman spectrum also reveals a signature of @xmath2 bonded carbon at around 1500 @xmath4.@xcite we note that a very similar non - diamond raman signature has also been present in the cvd diamond film used as a starting material for nd production.@xcite the @xmath2 bonded carbon is supposed to reside mainly on or below the surfaces of the diamonds partly as a result of surface damage during the milling procedure or as a residual of @xmath2 bonded carbon from the grain boundaries of the cvd film . as a consequence of the milling process",
    "being carried out in water , the nds most probably initially reveal a termination with hydroxyl functional groups.@xcite however , acid cleaning has been subsequently employed to remove contaminants from the milling process possibly partially oxidizing the surfaces .",
    "we now subject the sample to two oxidation steps : in a first oxidation step , the sample is heated to 460 @xmath1c in air and kept at that temperature for 90 mins [ raman spectrum : curve 4 in fig .  [ figureraman](a ) ] . in a second oxidation step ,",

    "all surface treatments , especially the heating in air to 480 @xmath1c reduce the signal related to @xmath2 carbon which is in accordance with the assumption that the @xmath2 carbon phase is located at the surfaces of the nds .",
    "furthermore , the oxygen surface treatments narrow the diamond raman line in contrast to the hydrogen treatment : after the first oxidation step , we find a width of 4.0 @xmath3 0.2 @xmath4 ; following the second step it further reduces to 3.7 @xmath3 0.2 @xmath4 . as mentioned before",
    ", the stress distribution in the diamond material can induce a broadening of the raman line.@xcite furthermore , diamond with a high defect density has a broader raman line.@xcite thus , the narrowing of the line suggests that the oxygen treatment is capable of removing highly stressed as well as highly defective regions of the milled nds .",
    "the oxidation procedure thus constitutes an enhancement of the crystalline quality of the nds .",
    "we note that further heating in air ( 500 @xmath1c , 2 hours ) , led to a significant reduction of the diamond quantity and no raman spectra could be obtained after that heating step . as a preliminary remark for the next section",

    "randomly created spatial patterns of the spin coated diamonds , we reliably identify and relocate distinct nds on the untreated samples as well as after the oxidation steps in a homebuilt confocal microscope setup .",
    "the employed confocal setup uses a microscope objective with a numerical aperture of 0.8 and the internal detection efficiency of the setup is estimated as 25% . for more details on the experimental setup",

    "]    the untreated nds mostly contain ensembles of siv centers : we observe no saturation of the fluorescence and intensity auto - correlation ( @xmath6 ) measurements do not indicate single photon emission ( antibunching ) .",

    "[ figurespectra](a ) : the zpl of the siv center is clearly visible , here at 739 nm . for most nds , the zpl resembles an asymmetric tail towards longer wavelengths , indicating an inhomogeneous broadening of the siv center ensemble zpl with a preferential red shift.@xcite due to the asymmetry as well as the unknown fraction of homogenous and inhomogeneous broadening , we can only estimate the linewidth @xmath7 as well as the peak position @xmath8 .",

    "[ figureoxtrendg2](a ) .",
    "we observe a general trend , which is also discernible in fig .",
    "[ figurespectra](a ) : the zpl linewidth is reduced , especially due to a narrowing of the line at the red wavelength edge , thus slightly diminishing the asymmetry of the line . due to this reduction of the asymmetry , we also obtain a shift of the peak wavelength when fitting a lorentzian line to the data .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ figureoxtrendg2](a ) .",
    "the maximum shift of the peak position is 0.3 nm , the typical reduction of the linewidth is 0.51 nm . furthermore , changes in the sideband spectrum , including vanishing features in the sideband region , have been observed for several nds .",
    "assuming that the absorption coefficient and the brightness of the siv centers as well as the collection and detection efficiency remain unchanged , the brightness of a nd before and after oxidation can serve as a measure of the number of siv centers contained in the nd .",
    "we observe a trend to a reduced brightness of the nds after each oxidation step ; in particular , after the second oxidation step , the average brightness is reduced to 2400 cps/@xmath9w .",
    "thus , one might conclude that the number of siv centers in the nds is reduced .",
    "the zpl is narrowed during the oxidation steps , as probably predominantly red shifted siv centers in stressed regions close to the surface of the nds are removed .",
    "the cleaning of the surface , however , does not seem to enhance the brightness of the remaining siv centers .",
    "this observation is in contrast to the observations reported in ref .",
    "were non - diamond carbon especially in the grain boundaries of polycrystalline diamond films has been found to quench siv luminescence .",
    "thus , one might expect a significant enhancement of the fluorescence upon surface cleaning .",
    "we emphasize that as we do not know how many centers have been removed , we can not conclusively determine the influence on the brightness of single siv centers , especially close to the surface .",
    "in contrast to the spectra of siv ensembles discussed above , we also find nds where a significantly narrowed , bright line dominates over a broader emission .",

    "a lorentzian fit of the narrow line yields a peak position of 737.2 nm with a width of 1.5 nm [ see dashed line in fig .",

    "[ figurespectra](b ) ] .",
    "we interpret this spectrum as follows : the narrow bright line originates from the emission of a single , bright siv center , whereas the underlying broad emission originates from the inhomogeneously broadened emission of an ensemble of weakly fluorescing siv centers .",
    "the observed linewidth of the single siv center is in accordance with previous observations for the linewidth of single siv centers ( 0.7 - 2.2 nm , ref .  ) .",
    "we note that in ref .",
    "single siv centers with brightness differing by almost two orders of magnitude have been observed , thus indicating a large spread of single emitter brightness for siv centers , suggesting why a single emitter can dominate over a whole ensemble of centers .    to prove this interpretation of the spectrum , we perform @xmath6 measurements after the first oxidation step .",
    "the @xmath6 measurement shows an antibunching dip and is displayed in fig 3(b ) .",
    "however , @xmath10 , thus only imperfect single photon emission is observed and one can not straightforwardly conclude that a single emitter is present . in the following ,",
    "we discuss in detail that the measured @xmath6 function is in accordance with our interpretation of the spectrum consisting of a narrow single emitter line and an underlying ensemble emission .",
    "the @xmath6 function indicates a three level internal population dynamics in accordance with previous observations on single siv centers.@xcite we fit the correlation measurements using the @xmath6 function of a three level system . to take into account the timing jitter of the detection setup , which leads to a deviation from @xmath11 , we convolute the @xmath6 function with the instrument response of our hanbury brown twiss setup ( timing jitter 354 ps , gaussian jitter @xmath12 width , for details see ref . ) .",
    "furthermore , we include the underlying ensemble emission as an uncorrelated background following ref .  .",
    "the assumption of an uncorrelated emission from the ensemble is justified as for nds containing ensembles of siv centers , we only found featureless @xmath6 functions indicating uncorrelated emission .",
    "we use the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ figurespectra](b ) to estimate the ratio between the emission intensities in the single emitter line as well as in the ensemble .",
    "we note that for the @xmath6 measurements a bandpass filter with a transmission window between 730 and 750 nm has been used , thus photons from the ensemble emission as well as the single emitter contribute to the measurement .",
    "we find a probability of 63% that a detected photon has been emitted into the narrow line and thus stems from the single emitter .",
    "we include this probability into the fit of the @xmath6 function to account for the background emission and obtain a very good agreement with the measured data [ see solid lines fig .  [ figureoxtrendg2](b ) ] thus proving our interpretation that the main contribution to the emission , i.e. the narrow , bright emission line , stems from a single siv center .",
    "after the second oxidation , a more pronounced antibunching dip with @xmath13 is observed [ see fig .",
    "[ figureoxtrendg2](c ) ] . furthermore ,",
    "following the second oxidation step , we clearly observe a saturation behavior as expected for a single emitter instead of a linearly rising fluorescence .",
    "we use @xmath14 to fit the fluorescence intensity @xmath15 in dependence of the excitation power @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is the saturation power , where @xmath18 is the maximum emission rate of the single emitter and @xmath19 gives the brightness of uncorrelated background emission , here predominantly due to the underlying siv ensemble .",
    "the fit yields @xmath20 @xmath9w , @xmath21 kcps , @xmath22 cps/@xmath9w . from this saturation measurement",
    ", we estimate the probability that a photon has been emitted by the single , bright siv center in the @xmath6 measurement as 69% .",
    "again , the fitted @xmath6 function well describes the measured data , proving that the bright , narrow zpl belongs to a single emitter .",
    "thus , the underlying ensemble emission is reduced by the second oxidation step as also visible from the spectrum displayed in fig .",
    "[ figurespectra](b ) , where a significant narrowing of the line at the red edge of the zpl is discernible .",
    "thus , the observation coincides with the findings on the nds hosting siv center ensembles .",
    "the fact that the narrow single emitter is not destroyed during the oxidation steps hints at an incorporation of this color center in a region of the nd which is not particularly close to the surface . summarizing , we have successfully employed oxidation in air as a method to reduce the influence of a weakly fluorescing ensemble of siv centers resulting in an increased single photon emission probability from a bright single siv center in a basd nd , thus significantly enhancing its performance as a single photon source .",

    "<S> we report fluorescence investigations and raman spectroscopy on colloidal nanodiamonds ( nds ) obtained via bead assisted sonic disintegration ( basd ) of a polycrystalline chemical vapor deposition film . </S>",
    "<S> the basd nds contain _ in situ _ created silicon vacancy ( siv ) centers . </S>",
    "<S> whereas many nds exhibit emission from siv ensembles , we also identify nds featuring predominant emission from a single bright siv center . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate oxidation of the nds in air as a tool to optimize the crystalline quality of the nds via removing damaged regions resulting in a reduced ensemble linewidth as well as single photon emission with increased purity . </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore investigate the temperature dependent zero - phonon - line fine - structure of a bright single siv center as well as the polarization properties of its emission and absorption . </S>"
