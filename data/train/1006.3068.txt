    "large area cluster surveys extending to high redshift can be used to study the evolution of the abundance of galaxy clusters , thereby delivering precise constraints on the amount and nature of the dark energy @xcite .",
    "the accuracy with which the observed mass proxy can be linked to the true cluster mass fundamentally limits the cosmological constraints from the survey .",
    "in particular , a redshift dependent bias on a survey s cluster mass estimates could mimic a time - evolving dark energy , so this systematic must be understood and constrained .",
    "clusters are known to evolve  through mergers , galaxy and star formation , and variable contributions from active galactic nuclei ( agn )  and these effects will influence the evolution of any cluster observable at some level .",
    "most of the baryonic mass in clusters is in the form of an intra - cluster gas that can be heated to several kev as it virializes in a massive cluster s gravitational potential well .",
    "this gas is visible in the x - ray band via thermal bremsstrahlung and also from its distortion of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) from inverse compton scattering , otherwise known as the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite .",
    "the lowest scatter cluster observables that scale with cluster mass , @xmath16 , are likely those most closely related to the gas pressure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and hence related to the total energy of the gas .",
    "the sz intensity is proportional to the comptonization , the line - of - sight integral of the gas pressure .",
    "hence , the sz signal integrated over the cluster s extent , @xmath6 , measures the total pressure in the cluster .",
    "an x - ray analogue , @xmath10 , can be constructed from the product of the cluster s total gas mass and the x - ray spectroscopic temperature @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath17 relation has been found to be smaller than the measurement error in x - ray studies conducted to date @xcite , and has been used to place interesting constraints on the dark energy equation of state with only a relatively small sample of clusters @xcite .",
    "the slope and scatter of the relationship between @xmath6 and the cluster mass , @xmath16 , has been studied extensively in simulations and is expected to be relatively insensitive to non - gravitational physics @xcite , the dynamical state of clusters @xcite , and the presence of cool cores @xcite .",
    "the expected close correlation between cluster mass and @xmath6 , as well as the redshift independence of the sz brightness , strongly motivates using sz cluster surveys for cosmological studies @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been significant progress in measuring the sz - signal from clusters .",
    "high resolution imaging has been obtained for single objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and icm profiles have been measured for moderately sized samples ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the first clusters discovered with a blind sz survey were reported in @xcite , and showed the capability of the sz - signal as a cluster finder . from larger samples , scaling relations have been measured between the sz - signal and mass estimates from both x - ray and weak lensing measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "notably , @xcite measured a @xmath6-@xmath16 relation from binned wmap fluxes at the location of known x - ray selected clusters combined with x - ray luminosity based mass estimates .",
    "they found a @xmath6-@xmath16 relation with a normalization and slope that matched the x - ray prediction , however similar analyses have found conflicting results @xcite .",
    "more detailed observations comparing sz and x - ray measurements will improve our understanding of the gas pressure in clusters .",
    "the first sz - selected catalog of clusters was presented in @xcite ( hereafter v10 ) , and included the first meaningful cosmological constraints from an sz cluster survey . in v10 ,",
    "the sample of 21 clusters had a median redshift of @xmath18 and was predicted to be 100@xmath19 complete above a mass threshold of @xmath20 at @xmath21 .",
    "the cosmological constraints from v10 were limited by uncertainties in the cluster mass calibration .",
    "this calibration relied on the dark matter simulations of @xcite , with gas physics based on the models in @xcite , to link the sz - significance to cluster mass .",
    "this introduced a @xmath22 systematic uncertainty in the mass calibration due to uncertainties in the pressure normalization of the simulations .",
    "therefore , an important first step to improve the cosmological constraints of v10 is to tie the sz observables to observationally calibrated x - ray scaling relations , such as those in @xcite .",
    "the v10 cluster sample is also unique because of its high median redshift and sz - selection .",
    "x - ray observations of these clusters could allow additional constraints on the redshift evolution of x - ray scaling relations , which typically have been studied from x - ray selected samples concentrated at @xmath23 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this work ,",
    "we present results from x - ray observations of a subset of 15 clusters with the highest sz - significance from v10 .",
    "we report on the x - ray observables of this sample , and use x - ray scaling relations from @xcite to estimate each cluster s mass . for each cluster",
    ", we also note details of the cluster s x - ray morphology and the identification of x - ray sources with objects in other catalogs .",
    "we use the x - ray measured gas density profiles to improve the sz estimates of integrated comptonization , @xmath6 .",

    "@xcite measure a universal pressure profile from x - ray measurements for a representative set of local massive clusters .",
    "these measurements were deep enough to constrain the cluster density and temperature profiles out to @xmath3 in each cluster .",
    "they find that their sample is well fit by a universal pressure profile that is defined only by @xmath25 .",
    "for each cluster in our sample , we re - calculate @xmath297 assuming the universal pressure profile from @xcite and the x - ray measured values for @xmath3 and @xmath25 given in tables [ ysztable ] and [ masstab ] , respectively . comparing these @xmath297 estimates to the values given in table [ ysztable ] , we find that this ratio has a mean and standard deviation of @xmath313 averaged over the sample .",
    "there is one significant ( @xmath314 ) outlier , spt - cl j0516 - 5430 , whose @xmath297 deviates by a factor of 0.59 .",
    "this cluster is a major merger , and the observed cluster profile is noticeably poorly fit by the @xcite pressure profile , which does not capture the disturbed distribution of the central gas in this cluster .",
    "leaving this cluster out of our comparison , the average ratio becomes @xmath315 .",
    "therefore we see no detectable bias when assuming the @xcite pressure profile , but these results suggest that there could be an additional @xmath316 uncertainty in our @xmath297 measurements from our assumed pressure profile .    as an additional test , we vary the outer slope of the @xcite temperature profile in equation [ universalt ] , letting the exponent on the term in the right hand side of the denominator vary between 0.16 to 0.80 , from its starting value of 0.45 .",
    "this range of values matches the full range of effective slopes of the temperature profile at @xmath3 as measured in the sample of @xcite . calculating new @xmath297 estimates assuming these new temperature profiles",
    ", we find they change the @xmath297 values given in table [ ysztable ] on average by a factor of @xmath317 and @xmath318 for the exponent values of 0.16 and 0.80 , respectively .",
    "while we consider such a significant systematic shift in the temperature profile unlikely across the whole sample , this level of variation in temperature profiles could contribute added statistical uncertainty in the @xmath297 estimates .    as a limiting case",
    ", we also recalculate @xmath297 assuming that the cluster is isothermal and with a density profile corresponding to the best - fit profile to the x - ray measurements . comparing @xmath297 for the isothermal profile to the values given in table [ ysztable ] , we find that this ratio has a mean and standard deviation of @xmath319 averaged over the sample .",
    "this is certainly an extreme case because of the abundance of evidence for the temperature profile in clusters decreasing significantly by @xmath3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "suzaku_-observations of nearby clusters at large radii also indicate a drop of gas temperature by a factor @xmath320 at @xmath321 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also note that the temperature profile with an exponent of 0.80 assumed in the previous paragraph would have a gas temperature that dropped by a factor of @xmath322 at @xmath321 , so even this would seem like an extreme case .",
    "overall , we are encouraged that the variation in @xmath297 is found to be @xmath323 when assuming a broad range of different temperature and pressure profiles found in the works of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "therefore we conservatively assume an additional @xmath324 statistical uncertainty in our @xmath297 estimates from any assumed model uncertainty , which we have added in quadrature to the uncertainties given in table [ ysztable ] .",
    "astrophysical point sources in the direction of the cluster can potentially fill in the sz cluster decrement and bias the integrated comptonization low .",
    "there are generally two populations of sources that can contaminate the sz signal : dusty or radio bright sources . in v10 ,",
    "the potential contamination from both were discussed , and neither is expected to significantly bias the sz measurements at 150 ghz averaged over the sample .",
    "we review some of those conclusions here .    in the appendix",
    ", we discuss radio detections at 843 mhz by the sydney university molonglo sky survey ( sumss ) towards the clusters in this work .",
    "the majority of radio sources in clusters have been found to have steep spectra with @xmath325 ( where @xmath326 ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite find a median spectral index of @xmath327 between @xmath328 and @xmath329 ghz for radio sources towards a sample of massive clusters ranging from @xmath330 . in v10 , they noted that a typical cluster would suffer a decrease of @xmath331 for a 2 mjy ( 5 mjy ) source at 150 ghz .",
    "located at 0.5@xmath332 ( 1@xmath332 ) from the cluster center . assuming a spectral index of @xmath327 , a 2 mjy ( 5 mjy ) source at 150 ghz would be @xmath1483 ( 210 ) mjy at the sumss observing frequency of 843 mhz . as detailed in the appendix ,",
    "no source has been detected above either threshold within 1@xmath332 of any cluster in this work .",
    "however , for any individual cluster radio source , extrapolating its flux from radio frequencies to the spt observing frequency of 152.9 ghz is difficult because of the broad range and frequency dependence of the spectral indices that is typical for these sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in practice , extrapolating the flux of any sumss detected source to the spt observing frequency will have factors of a few uncertainty without further observations spanning an intermediate range of frequencies . with this caveat in mind",
    ", there appears to be no source strong enough to significantly bias the sz flux estimate for any cluster in this work .    including every source detected within 0.5@xmath332 of each cluster center in our sample , the cumulative sumss flux is 224.5 mjy .",
    "if we assume a spectral index of -0.72 , this would imply an average flux of @xmath140.35 mjy per cluster at 152.9 ghz .",
    "this would correspond to an average decrease in the sz flux of @xmath142% , assuming that these sources represent an overdensity to the background population .",
    "the average radio source contamination in sz surveys has been recently estimated in simulations of the microwave sky by @xcite .",
    "these simulations were motivated by observations by @xcite measuring the radio source population characteristics in low redshift ( @xmath172 ) x - ray detected clusters . for the mass limit of this work , @xmath20 , these studies predict that in @xmath3331% of clusters there would be radio source contamination large enough to effect the sz flux measurement at the @xmath314 level , with this result largely independent of redshift .",
    "v10 estimates a similar rate of contamination using a radio source count model @xcite and the measured over - abundance of radio sources near clusters @xcite .",
    "overall , the combination of the above results lead us to not expect any significant radio source contamination .",
    "emission from sub - millimeter bright galaxies can also contaminate the sz signal .",
    "these sources are typically dusty star forming galaxies that are very luminous but highly obscured , such that their luminosity is peaked at infrared ( ir ) wavelengths . the number counts and fluxes of these sources have been characterized between 0.5 - 2.0 mm wavelength by several experiments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and these measurements reasonably match simple analytic models describing their source population distribution @xcite . these sources can largely be approximated as a random background that contributes additional signal in the spt maps , and we have explicitly accounted for them in our matched filter in equation [ eqn : filter ] .",
    "however , this implementation did not account for any emission that could be correlated with clusters , or additional noise from the background objects being gravitationally lensed by the cluster .",
    "the former was argued to be insignificant in v10 because : the ir overdensity towards clusters is expected to be @xmath334 1 mjy at 150 ghz even out to highest redshift clusters in our sample , and observational measurements of the 100 @xmath40 m flux towards local clusters ( @xmath335 ) are too low to significantly bias the sz flux measurements even allowing for a strong redshift evolution of these sources .",
    "the latter has been characterized by @xcite to increase the flux noise towards clusters by @xmath1460% , which is at a level such that it would be @xmath3333% of the sz flux for the mass range of clusters in our sample .",
    "we note that because lensing is a surface brightness conserving process , this latter effect would not bias our results when averaged over a large sample of clusters .",
    "one noteworthy exception where point source contamination is evident is the cluster spt - cl j2332 - 5358 .",
    "this cluster was the only candidate in v10 that was also coincident with a point source detected in the spt 220 ghz maps at @xmath336 .",
    "similar 220 ghz detected point sources have a source flux , @xmath245 , that scales with frequency as @xmath326 with @xmath337 between 150 and 220 ghz @xcite . extrapolating its measured 220 ghz source flux would predict a flux of @xmath338 mjy at 150 ghz . to the 150 ghz spt maps ,",
    "we subtract a point source of this brightness , after convolving it with the 150 ghz spt transfer function .",
    "we then repeat the same cluster extraction method as in v10 to calculate a new cluster position and spt - significance , @xmath44 , which is given in table [ obstable ] .",
    "this point source corrected 150 ghz map is used when calculating the @xmath6 given in table [ ysztable ] , and the added uncertainty in @xmath6 from the uncertain point source spectral index is added in quadrature with the other uncertainties outlined in  [ sec : calcsz ] .",
    "here we discuss the x - ray and sz scaling relations for the sample .",
    "we consider the integrated sz flux @xmath6 for both cylindrical and spherical volumes of integration .",
    "the integrated cylindrical estimate is deprojected to a spherical estimate as described in ",

    "the best fit parameters for these relations are listed in table [ scalingtab ] .",
    "the scaling between the icm gas mass ( @xmath62 ) and the spectroscopic temperature ( @xmath1 ) is an important test of the properties of this sz - selected sample .",
    "we want to know if the sz selection biases the observables in any way or if they are consistent with those from x - ray selected samples .",
    "the values of @xmath1 and @xmath62 within @xmath3 used here were derived as described in  [ specsec ] and  [ imagingsec ] and are given in table [ proxytable ] .",
    "this relation can provide clues about the high-@xmath108 behavior of the @xmath16-@xmath1 and @xmath16-@xmath62 scaling relations ( equations [ eq500 ] and [ eqfgas ] ) . to accurately constrain the evolution of these relations , however , either hydrostatic masses or masses obtained via an independent measurement are needed for high-@xmath108 clusters .      to compare our results with previous studies using x - ray selected samples we use the gas mass and temperature data for the low-@xmath108 ( median @xmath344 ) and high-@xmath108 ( median @xmath345 ) as measured by @xcite .",
    "we choose these samples since the data analysis is analogous to ours .",
    "we fit the scaling relation to these samples using the same method . for our spt - selected sample ( median @xmath346 )",
    "we find @xmath347 and @xmath348 ( see table [ scalingtab ] ) .",

    "this offset between low-@xmath108 and high-@xmath108 samples indicate deviations from self - similarity .",
    "the slope appears steep in our relation , although consistent with both the low- and high-@xmath108 x - ray selected samples as well as the self - similar slope , @xmath353 .",
    "a positive trend of the gas mass fraction with mass has been observed previously ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is likely what is causing the steeper than self- similar slope of the relation .",
    "numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also show an increasing gas mass fraction with redshift , presumably due to a different distribution of mass progenitors at high redshift .",
    "the spt - selected cluster sample is consistent with this scenario .",
    "the normalization agrees well with that of the high-@xmath108 sample of @xcite while still consistent with the low-@xmath108 sample at the @xmath354 level . we can not rule out that this behavior is partly related to deviations from self - similarity in the @xmath16-@xmath55 relation at high redshift",
