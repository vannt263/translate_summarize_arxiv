    "<S> we study algebraic conditions on a group @xmath0 under which every properly discontinuous , isometric @xmath0-action on a hadamard manifold has a @xmath0-invariant busemann function , and for such @xmath0 we prove the following : ( 1 ) every open complete nonpositively curved riemannian @xmath1 manifold that is homotopy equivalent to a finite complex of codimension @xmath2 is an open regular neighborhood of a subcomplex of the same codimension ; ( 2 ) each tangential homotopy type contains infinitely many open @xmath1 manifolds that admit no complete nonpositively curved metric even though their universal cover is the euclidean space . </S>",
    "<S> a sample application is that an open contractible manifold @xmath3 is homeomorphic to a euclidean space if and only if @xmath4 admits a complete riemannian metric of nonpositive curvature . </S>"
