    "the galactic o - star spectroscopic survey ( gosss , maz apellniz  2011 , sota  2011 ) is obtaining long - slit , @xmath12500 , blue - green spectroscopy of @xmath02500 massive stars in both hemispheres , including all known o stars with @xmath2 .",
    "its main purpose is to characterize the o - star population in the solar neighborhood by providing accurate spectral types for all of the observed targets .",
    "we currently have spectra for 1592 stars and we plan to reach 2500 within two years .",
    "four other surveys are obtaining high - resolution spectroscopy of a subsample of the gosss stars with the purposes of doing detailed atmospheric modeling and calculating the orbits of the spectroscopic binaries .",
    "three of those surveys , own ( barb  2010 ) , iacob ( simn - daz  2011a , 2011b ) , and nomads ( maz apellniz  2012 ) , have been described elsewhere .",
    "the fourth one , caf - beans ( calar alto fiber - fed chelle binary evolution andalusian survey , p.i .",
    ": ignacio negueruela ) , is obtaining multi - epoch @xmath3 65000 spectroscopy of northern stars using the caf spectrograph at the 2.2  m telescope at calar alto ( aceituno  2012 ) .",
    "the original goal of these surveys was to study the stars but they also contain an unprecedented amount of information on optical ism lines . that led us to start a parallel project to obtain and process such information .",
    "in this first analysis we study the properties of the dibs seen in the gosss data .",
    "* table 1 .",
    "* gosss extincted and reference stars used in this work .    [ cols=\"^,<,<,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we selected 9 stars observed by gosss with high extinction , good s / n spectra , and coverage of the full 3900 - 5500   range ( table 1 ) .",
    "for each star we selected a corresponding gosss star with low extinction and similar spectra type in order to apply the traditional pair method , in which the low - extinction spectrum is subtracted from the high - extinction one in order to eliminate the stellar contribution .",
    "the spectra were put in the ism reference system using the caii  @xmath43934 line .",
    "the average profile was then calculated for each dib by selecting the stars in the sample with the largest ews , normalizing by it , and calculating the mean and standard deviation of the spectra at each wavelength .",
    "the result was fit using either gaussian and lorentzian profiles ( multiple in the case where dibs overlap so they must be fitted in groups ) .",
    "finally , the instrumental width was subtracted to the fit fwhm .",
    "results for the gaussian fits are shown in table 2 .    *",
    "we clearly detect the seldom seen 4179   broad dib ( knoechel & moffat 1982 , jenniskens & dsert 1994 ; fig .",
    "1 ) . * the broad intense 4428   dib is better fit by a lorentzian than a gaussian ( see snow .",
    ". however , the differences are small and the broad lorentzian wings make rectification difficult in practice , so gaussian fits are less noisy for most data .",
    "* we detect the previously elusive 4591   broad dib , which could be produced by coronene ( c@xmath5h@xmath6 ) and ovalene ( c@xmath7h@xmath8 ) cations ( ehrenfreund et al .",
    "1995 , fig .",
    "* the 4770   region requires a fit with two narrow and one broad dibs ( fig .",
    "1 ) . * the 4880   region requires a fit with one broad and one intermediate dibs ( fig .",
    "1 ) . * the 5110   dib shows a possible additional component in its left wing .",
    "* there may be a broad component around the 5364   dib ( not measured ) .",
    "* at this resolution the two narrow dibs to the left and right of heii  @xmath45412 are blended with the stellar line and are not analyzed here . *",
    "the 5240   region shows two clearly separated components at this resolution . *",
    "the 5490   region shows two clearly separated components at this resolution ."
