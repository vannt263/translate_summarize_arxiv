    "in this paper we continue the study of vertex - intersection graphs of paths in grids ( vpg graphs ) started by asinowski et .",
    "al @xcite .",
    "vpg representation _ of a graph @xmath6 is a collection of paths of the rectangular grid where the paths represent the vertices of @xmath6 in such a way that two vertices of @xmath6 are adjacent if and only if the corresponding paths share at least one vertex .",
    "vpg representations arise naturally when studying circuit layout problems and layout optimization @xcite where layouts are modelled as paths ( wires ) on grids .",
    "one approach to minimize the cost or difficulty of production involves minimizing the number of times the wires bend @xcite .",
    "thus the research has been focused on vpg representations parameterized by the number of times each path is allowed to _ bend _ ( these representations are also the focus of @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , a _ @xmath0-bend path _ is a path in the grid which contains at most @xmath0 _ bends _ where a _",
    "is when two consecutive edges on the path have different horizontal / vertical orientation . in this sense",
    "a @xmath1-vpg representation of a graph @xmath6 is a vpg representation of @xmath6 where each path is a @xmath0-bend path .",
    "a graph is @xmath1-vpg if it has a @xmath1-vpg representation .",
    "several relationships between vpg graphs and traditional graph classes ( i.e. , circle graphs , circular arc graphs , interval graphs , planar graphs , segment ( seg ) graphs , and string ( string ) graphs ) were observed in @xcite .",
    "for example , the equivalence between string graphs ( the intersection graphs of curves in the plane ) and vpg graphs is formally proven in @xcite , but it was known as folklore result @xcite . additionally , the base case of this family of graph classes ( namely , @xmath7-vpg ) is a special case of segment graphs ( the intersection graphs of line segments in the plane ) .",
    "specifically , @xmath7-vpg is more well known as the 2-dir - dir graph is an intersection graph of straight line segments in the plane with at most @xmath0 distinct directions ( slopes ) . ] .",
    "the recognition problem for the vpg = string graph class is known to be np - hard by @xcite and in np by @xcite .",
    "similarly , it is np - complete to recognize 2-dir = @xmath7-vpg graphs @xcite .",
    "however , the recognition status of @xmath1-vpg for every @xmath8 was given as an open problem from @xcite ( all cases were conjectured to be np - complete ) .",
    "we confirm this conjecture by proving a stronger result .",
    "namely , we demonstrate that deciding whether a @xmath4-vpg graph is a @xmath1-vpg graph is np - complete ( for any fixed @xmath8 )  see section [ sec : reduction ] .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite it is shown that @xmath7-vpg @xmath3 @xmath9-vpg @xmath3 vpg and it was conjectured that @xmath1-vpg @xmath3 @xmath4-vpg for every @xmath10 .",
    "we confirm this conjecture constructively  see section  [ sec : sausage ] .",
    "finally , we consider the relationship between the @xmath1-vpg graph classes and segment graphs .",
    "in particular , we show that seg and @xmath1-vpg are incomparable through the following pair of results ( the latter of which is somewhat surprising ) : ( 1 ) there is a @xmath9-vpg graph which is not a seg graph ; ( 2 ) for every @xmath0 , there is a 3-dir graph which has no @xmath1-vpg representation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : nfl ] we introduce the noodle - forcing lemma , which is the key to restricting the topological structure of vpg representations . in section  [ sec : sausage ] we introduce the `` sausage '' structure which is the crucial gadget that we use for the hardness reduction and which by itself shows that @xmath1-vpg is strict subset of @xmath4-vpg .",
    "we also demonstrate the incomparability of @xmath1-vpg and seg in section [ sec : sausage ] . the np - hardness reduction is presented in section  [ sec : reduction ] .",
    "we end the paper with some remarks and open problems .",
    "in this section , we present the key lemma of this paper ( see lemma [ lem - noodle ] ) .",
    "essentially , we prove that , for `` proper '' representations @xmath11 of a graph @xmath6 , there is a graph @xmath12 where @xmath6 is an induced subgraph of @xmath12 and @xmath11 is `` sub - representation '' of every representation of @xmath12 ( i.e. , all representations of @xmath12 require the part corresponding to @xmath6 to have the `` topological structure '' of @xmath11 ) .",
    "we begin this section with several definitions .",
    "let @xmath13 be a graph .",
    "a _ representation _ of @xmath6 is a collection @xmath14 of piecewise linear curves in the plane , such that @xmath15 is nonempty iff @xmath16 is an edge of  @xmath6 .",
    "an _ intersection point _ of a representation @xmath11 is a point in the plane that belongs to ( at least ) two distinct curves of @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the set of intersection points of  @xmath11 .",
    "a representation is _ proper _ if    1 .",
    "each @xmath18 is a simple curve , i.e. , it does not intersect itself , 2 .",
    "@xmath11 has only finitely many intersection points ( in particular no two curves may overlap ) and finitely many bends , and 3 .",
    "each intersection point @xmath19 belongs to exactly two curves of @xmath11 , and the two curves cross in @xmath19 ( in particular , the curves may not touch , and an endpoint of a curve may not belong to another curve ) .    let @xmath11 be a proper representation of @xmath13 , let @xmath20 be another ( not necessarily proper ) representation of @xmath6 , and let @xmath21 be a mapping from @xmath17 to @xmath22 .",
    "we say that @xmath21 is _ order - preserving _ if it is injective and has the property that for every @xmath23 , if @xmath24 are all the distinct intersection points on @xmath18 , then @xmath25 all belong to @xmath26 and they appear on @xmath26 in the same relative order as the points @xmath27 on @xmath18 .",

    "moreover , for any @xmath37 , any ( not necessarily proper ) representation of @xmath12 can be transformed by a homeomorphism of the plane and by circular inversion into a representation @xmath38 with these properties :    1 .   for every vertex @xmath23 ,",

    "we say that a point in the plane is _ a special point _ of @xmath11 , if it is an endpoint of a curve in @xmath11 , a bend of a curve in @xmath11 , or an intersection point of  @xmath11 .",
    "before we describe the graph @xmath12 , we first construct an auxiliary graph @xmath43 which is a subdivision of a 3-connected plane graph whose drawing overlays the representation @xmath11 and has the following properties .    1 .   the edges of @xmath43 are drawn as vertical and horizontal segments , and every internal face of @xmath43 is a rectangle ( possibly containing more than four vertices of @xmath43 on its boundary ) . the outer face of @xmath43 is not intersected by any curve of  @xmath11 .",

    "consider an arbitrary representation @xmath62 of @xmath12 .",
    "the curves in @xmath62 that correspond to the vertex - segments , edge - segments and connectors will be referred to as vertex - curves , edge - curves and connector curves .",

    "since @xmath43 is a subdivision of a 3-connected graph , each of its drawings can be transformed into any other drawing by a circular inversion and a homeomorphism .",
    "in particular , we may transform @xmath62 in such a way that the main part of any edge - curve is contained inside the corresponding edge - segment @xmath58 , the main part of any connector curve is contained inside the corresponding connector , and every vertex - curve representing a vertex @xmath53 is embedded in a small neighborhood of @xmath67 .",

    "grid intersection graphs are intersection graphs of vertical and horizontal segments in the plane with additional restriction that no two segments of the same direction share a common point . thus these graphs are formally close but not equal to @xmath7-vpg graphs ( where paths of the same direction are allowed to overlap )",
    ". however , bipartite @xmath7-vpg graphs are exactly grid intersection graphs .",
    "this follows from a result of bellantoni et al .",
    "@xcite who proved that bipartite intersection graphs of axes parallel rectangles are exactly grid intersection graphs .",
    "the reduction in  @xcite constructs , given a boolean formula @xmath148 , a graph @xmath149 which is a grid intersection graph if and only if @xmath148 is satisfiable . in arguing about this , a representation by vertical and horizontal segments",
    "is described for a general layout of @xmath149 for which it is also shown how to represent its parts corresponding to the clauses of the formula , referred to as _ clause gadgets _ , if at least one literal is true .",
    "the clause gadget is reprinted with a generous approval of the author in fig .",
    "[ fig : clausegadget ] , while fig .",
    "[ fig : onetrue ] shows the grid intersection representations of satisfied clauses , and fig .",
    "[ fig : falseclause ] shows the problem when all literals are false . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bend - clause ] , we show that in the case of all false literals , the clause gadget can be represented by grid paths with at most 1 bend each .",
    "it follows that @xmath150-vpg and a 1-bend representation can be constructed in polynomial time .",
    "thus , recognition of @xmath7-vpg is np - complete even if the input graph is given with a @xmath151-vpg representation .",
    "we use a similar approach for arbitrary @xmath10 with a help of the noodle - forcing lemma .",
    "we grill the same representation @xmath11 of @xmath118 as in the proof of theorem  [ thm : grill - k2 ] .",
    "we call the resulting graph @xmath152 where @xmath99 is one of the vertices of the @xmath118 , the one whose curve in @xmath11 is ending in a boundary cell denoted by @xmath153 in the schematic fig .",
    "[ fig : sausage ] .",
    "we call this graph the _ pin _ since it follows from lemma  [ lem - noodle ] that it has a @xmath1-vpg representation such that the bounding paths of the cell @xmath153 wrap around the grill and the last segment of @xmath100 extends arbitrarily far ( see the schematic fig .  [",
    "fig : sausagepin ] ) .",
    "we will refer to this extending segment as the _ tip _ of the pin .",
    "it is crucial to observe that in any @xmath1-vpg representation @xmath20 of @xmath152 all bends of @xmath154 are consumed between the crossing points with the curve representing the other vertex of @xmath118 and hence the part of @xmath154 that lies in the @xmath153 cell of @xmath20 is necessarily straight .",
    "next we combine two pins together to form a _",
    "clothespin_. the construction is illustrated in the schematic fig .",
    "[ fig : doublepin ] .",
    "we start with a @xmath155 whose edges are subdivided by one vertex each .",
    "every string representation of this graph contains 4 basic regions which correspond to the faces of a drawing of the @xmath155 ( this is true for every 3-connected planar graph and it is seen by contracting the curves corresponding to the degree 2 vertices , the argument going back to sinden  @xcite ) .",
    "we add two vertices @xmath156 that are connected by paths of length 2 to the boundary vertices of two triangles , say @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "the curves representing @xmath159 and @xmath160 must lie entirely inside the corresponding regions .",
    "then we add two pins , say @xmath161 and @xmath162 , connect the vertices of the boundary of @xmath163 to @xmath164 by paths of length 2 and make @xmath165 adjacent to a vertex on the boundary of @xmath166 ( for @xmath167 ) .",
    "finally , we add a third pin @xmath168 and make @xmath169 adjacent to @xmath170 and @xmath171 . we denote the resulting graph by @xmath172 .",
    "it is easy to check that the clothespin has a @xmath1-vpg representation @xmath173 such that the tips of @xmath174 and @xmath175 are parallel and extend arbitrarily far from the rest of the representation , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : doublepin ] .",
    "on the other hand , in any @xmath1-vpg representation @xmath20 of @xmath172 , if a curve crosses @xmath176 and @xmath177 and no other path of @xmath178 , then it must cross the tips of @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "this follows from the fact that for @xmath167 , @xmath179 must lie in @xmath163 ( to be able to reach all its bounding curves ) , and hence , by circle inversion , all bends of @xmath180 are trapped inside @xmath166 .",
    "if a curve crosses both @xmath176 and @xmath177 , it must cross them outside @xmath181 , and hence it only may cross their tips .",
    "now we are ready to describe the construction of @xmath182 .",
    "we take @xmath149 as constructed in  @xcite replace every vertex @xmath99 by a clothespin @xmath172 , and whenever @xmath183 , we add edges @xmath184 .",
    "now we claim that @xmath185-vpg if and only if @xmath148 is satisfiable , while @xmath186-vpg is always true .    on one hand ,",
    "if @xmath185-vpg and @xmath20 is a @xmath1-vpg representation of @xmath182 , then the tips of @xmath187 form a 2-dir representation of @xmath149 ( @xmath176 and @xmath188 may only intersect in their tips ) and @xmath148 is satisfiable .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath148 is satisfiable , we represent @xmath149 as a grid intersection graph and replace every segment of the representation by a clothespin with slim parallel tips and the body of the pin tiny enough so that does not intersect anything else in the representation .",
    "similarly , if @xmath148 is not satisfiable , we modify a 1-bend representation of @xmath149 by replacing the paths of the representation by clothespins with 1-bend on the tips , thus obtaining a @xmath4-vpg representation of @xmath149 .",
    "the representation consists of a large part inherited from the representation of @xmath149 and tiny parts representing the heads of the pins , but these can be made all of the same constant size and thus providing only a constant ratio refinement of the representation of  @xmath149 .",
    "the representation is thus still of linear size and can be constructed in polynomial time .",
    "in this paper we have affirmatively settled two main conjectures of asinowski et al @xcite regarding vpg graphs .",
    "we have also demonstrated the relationship between @xmath1-vpg graphs and segment graphs .",
    "the first conjecture that we settled claimed that @xmath1-vpg is a strict subset of @xmath4-vpg for all @xmath0 .",
    "we have proven this constructively .",
    "previously only the following separation was known : @xmath7-vpg @xmath3 @xmath9-vpg @xmath3 vpg .",
    "the second conjecture claimed that the @xmath1-vpg recognition problem is np - complete for all @xmath0 .",
    "we have actually proven a stronger result ; namely , that the @xmath1-vpg recognition problem is np - complete for all @xmath0 even when the input graph is a @xmath4-vpg graph . previously only the np - completeness of @xmath7-vpg ( from 2-dir @xcite ) and vpg ( from string @xcite ) were known .    finally due to the close relationship between vpg graphs and segment graphs ( i.e. , since @xmath7-vpg",
    "= 2-dir , and seg @xmath3 string = vpg ) we have considered the relationship between these classes . in particular , we have shown that :      thus , to obtain polynomial time recognition algorithms , one would need to restrict attention to specific cases with ( potentially ) useful structure . in this respect , in @xcite , certain subclasses of @xmath7-vpg graphs have been characterized and shown to admit polynomial time recognition ; namely split , chordal claw - free , and chordal bull - free @xmath7-vpg graphs are discussed in @xcite .",
    "additionally , in @xcite , @xmath7-vpg chordal and 2-row @xmath7-vpg have been shown to have polynomial time recognition algorithms .",
    "in particular , we conjecture that applying similar restrictions to the @xmath1-vpg graph class will also yield polynomial time recognition algorithms .",
    "it is interesting to note that since our separating examples are not chordal it is also open whether @xmath1-vpg chordal @xmath3 @xmath4-vpg chordal .",
