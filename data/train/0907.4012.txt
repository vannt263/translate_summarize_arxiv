    "in recent years several experimental and theoretical considerations indicate that the qgp right above the deconfining phase transition does not behave like a weakly coupled gas of quarks and gluons but that the interactions among plasma constituents are not small .",
    "this observation has lead to increasing interest in the dynamics of strongly coupled plasmas analyzed via the ads / cft correspondence . in these proceedings",
    "we report about a generic feature of all strongly coupled plasmas with a gravity dual @xcite .",
    "our discussion is based on two assumptions about the properties of heavy mesons in a deconfined medium which are fulfilled by all gauge theories with a gravity dual :    1 .",
    "heavy vector mesons such as the @xmath2 remain bound above the deconfinement transition . even though this is the subject of intense theoretical research ,",
    "studies of lattice data indicate that this might be the case @xcite 2 .",
    "the in - medium dispersion relation of these mesons is significantly modified and they posses a ( sub - luminal ) maximum speed of propagation .",
    "we will also need to assume that the dispersion relation extends to sufficiently large momentum and that the meson states remain sufficiently narrow .",
    "these assumptions are enough to describe the main features of the in - medium dispersion relation ; its generic form is shown in a ) . at high momentum ,",
    "the dispersion relation approaches a constant slope , which determines the in - medium limiting velocity @xmath3 . at small momentum",
    "the dispersion relation approaches a finite value of @xmath4 , the in medium mass . as a consequence of this asymptotic behavior ,",
    "the dispersion relation crosses the light - cone at a position @xmath5 .",
    "note that this crossing does not mean that heavy quark becomes massless at this point ; the dispersion relation is very different from the vacuum one and there is no reason why the invariant @xmath6 should be considered as the mass .    at the point",
    "@xmath7 the in - medium @xmath2 has the same quantum numbers of the photon ; thus , the electromagnetic interaction leads to mixing of these two degenerate states .",
    "what this means is that at @xmath7 the in - medium @xmath2 can decay into an _ on shell _ photon .",
    "this is different from the standard @xmath2 decay into dileptons , in which the @xmath2 leads to an _ off shell _ photon of virtuality of the @xmath2 mass .",
    "the mixing between the in - medium @xmath2 and the on shell photon leads to a peak in the current - curren correlator at null momentum @xmath8 at @xmath9 .",
    "a direct consequence of this observation is that if the dispersion relation of mesons is of the type described , a quark gluon plasma at finite temperature with a @xmath2 in kinetic equilibrium would lead to an almost monochromatic peak of photons at @xmath7 with a width given by the in - medium width of the @xmath2 .",

    "we can find an example in which the assumed features of the meson dispersion relation are realized : @xmath11 super - symmetric yang mills with @xmath12 flavors in the @xmath13 , @xmath14 limit with @xmath15 at finite temperature . in this case , the dynamics can be described by a dual gravitational theory with @xmath16 d7 probe branes ; the fact that @xmath15 implies that the back - reaction of the branes can be neglected and the metric is that of thermal @xmath11 without d7 branes which in suitable coordinates is given by ds^2= ( -f(z ) dt^2 + + dx^2 ) + l^2 d_5 with @xmath17 and t is the temperature .",
    "the d7 branes span the coordinates @xmath18 and a 3-sphere within the @xmath19 .",
    "the d7 branes can end `` in thin air '' at a scale @xmath20 ; if @xmath21 the branes are outside the black hole ( minkowski embedding ) . in this case , the small excitations of the brane correspond to ( infinitely narrow ) mesons in the dual gauge theory and the scale @xmath22 determines their mass .",
    "if the temperature is higher , the brane falls inside of the black - hole and there are no mesons excitations ( black - hole embedding ) @xcite .",
    "the d3-d7 model in the minkowski phase constitutes an interesting model to study the dynamics of meson in a strongly coupled , deconfined gauge theory plasma .    in the minkowski embedding , due to the gravitational attraction",
    ", the meson wave function is concentrated around the tip of the brane , @xmath20 . as a consequence of the gravitational redshift in the presence of the black hole , the speed of light in the @xmath23 hyperplane is reduced and it is given by [ eqvl ] = = 1-(t ) ^4 thus , meson excitations in this theory can not move faster than @xmath3 .",
    "this observation provides a simple geometrical interpretation for the meson dispersion relation computed in the d3/d7 model a ) .",
    "we now note that discussion above is common to all strongly coupled , large @xmath0 gauge theory plasmas with a gravity dual since in these theories a finite number of flavors @xmath12 is described by @xmath12 d - brane probes and since the deconfined phase of these theories is described by background with a black - hole .",
    "since at the black - hole horizon the time component of the metric @xmath24 the limiting velocity of the mesons excitations is sub - luminal .",
    "thus , if qcd has a gravity dual in the large @xmath0 limit , the dispersion relation of heavy mesons ( and in particular heavy vector mesons ) must cross the lightcone leading to a peak on the photon spectrum as discussed in the previous section .",
    "we now address whether such a peak could be observed in a relativistic nucleus - nucleus collision . the natural vector meson candidates to consider are the @xmath2 and the @xmath25",
    "since they may survive the deconfining transition ( we have not considered the @xmath26 since its survival is more controversial ) .",
    "the main difference with the analysis above is that in a collision the temperature of the plasma is not fixed , but it evolves as the plasma expands and cools . as a consequence , the energy at which the peak would occur changes : it grows as the temperature is reduced . depending on",
    "how fast the expansion happens , the peak may be transformed into an enhancement in the neighborhood of the meson mass .",
    "another difficulty for the observation of the peak is the existence of more sources for photons such as the thermal emission from light degrees of freedom and the prompt photon emission ( perturbative contribution ) .",
    "addressing the exact magnitude of the effect in a nuclear collision is a complicated task that demands an accurate model of the dynamics of the medium , the dynamics of mesons in the plasma and the meson production mechanism .",
    "however there are significant theoretical uncertainties in these issues , specially in the interaction of meson with the plasmas ; there are different theoretical models that address the @xmath2 suppression pattern .",
    "thus , we will not try to improve the current description of in - medium meson , but we will construct a model in which the peak can be observed in the final photon distribution .",
    "instead of embedding the thermal rate into a hydrodynamical calculation , for this estimate we use a fireball model in which the volume of the system expands as @xmath27 and , in the qgp phase the product @xmath28 is constant .",
    "we will assume that the initial temperature of the fireball is larger than the meson dissociation temperature .",
    "we first consider the @xmath29 since the thermal photon emission in the region of @xmath30 gev is dominant at the lhc .",
    "inspired by statistical recombination @xcite , we assume that the @xmath31-pairs produced in the initial collisions become kinetically equilibrated in the qgp but their total number , @xmath32 , stays constant",
    ". this condition is implemented via a fugacity factor g_c(t ) = , where @xmath33 is the in - medium charm - quark mass . at @xmath34",
    "the temperature reaches the dissociation temperature of the @xmath29 in the medium and a fraction of the @xmath31-pairs recombine forming @xmath29 mesons .",
    "their contribution to the total number of photons is s ( ) _ t_diss^t_hadro dt v(t ) g_c(t(t))^2 e^-/t(t ) _ j/ ( , t(t ) ) , [ signal ] where the ` s ' stands for ` signal ' .",
    "the overall normalization is not important since it is the same as that for the background of thermal photons emitted by the light quarks , which is given by b ( ) _ 0^t_hadro dt v(t ) e^-/t(t ) .",
    "[ b ] we have omitted @xmath35 since , guided by the results for plasmas with a gravity dual , we assume it is structureless .    we model the spectral function for the @xmath2 by a unit - area gaussian distribution of width @xmath36 mev centered at @xmath37 .",
    "the dispersion relation we use is a fit to a ) and the @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath2 dissociation temperature is @xmath39 .",
    "the results of numerically evaluating and for lhc values of the parameters are plotted in b ) where the effect of the @xmath2 peak is clearly seen on the spectrum . however",
    ", this figure should be taken as illustrative , since the precise form is very sensitive to the value of the parameter used .",
    "the enhancement is , in particular , is quadratically sensitive to @xmath38 ; thus , our estimates indicate that at rhic , where @xmath40 is ten times smaller , the enhancement can not be observed .",
    "we have also explored the possibility of a similar enhancement for the @xmath25 meson at @xmath41 gev ; however at these energies the thermal photon contribution is exponentially suppressed as compare to pqcd photons .    as a conclusion",
    ", we have seen that a modified dispersion relation of the type shown in a ) for the @xmath2 leads , under certain assumptions , to a distinct peak in the thermal photon yield at the lhc in the region of @xmath42 gev .",
    "this dispersion relation is expected in all strongly coupled gauge theory plasma , so its observation would be in agreement with the interpretation of the qgp as strongly coupled . unfortunately , there are many model assumptions in the analysis and not observing this peak would not necessarily imply a weakly coupled picture of the qgp .",
