    "spatial and/or temporal confinement of light leading to the formation of localized structures ( ls s ) are drawing considerable attention both from fundamental as well as from applied point of views .",
    "these stationary solutions occur in a dissipative environment and belong to the class of dissipative structures .",
    "their existence , due to the occurrence of a turing ( or modulational ) instability , has been abundantly discussed and is by now fairly well understood ( see recent overviews on this issue @xcite ) .",
    "along another line of research , theoretical and experimental studies have shown the possibility to generate rogue waves ( rw ) in fiber optics .",
    "rogue waves are rare giant pulses or extreme events .",
    "they are also called dissipative rogue waves and have been generated in passively mode - locked lasers @xcite .",
    "the long tail probability distribution is the fundamental characteristics accounting for the generation of rogue waves .",
    "the modulational instability is an important mecanism for the creation of ocean waves as shown by peregrine @xcite .",
    "in addition , peregrine solitons are considered as a prototype of rogue waves formation .",
    "experimental confirmation of peregrine solitons has been demonstrated in optical fiber @xcite and in water wave tank @xcite systems .",
    "small amplitude pulses may grow to large amplitudes if their frequencies fall in the band of unstable mode with a positive gain .",
    "nonlinear interaction between unstable frequencies may lead to a very complicated wave dynamics .",
    "analytical study of the nonlinear interaction between two frequencies solutions of the nonlinear schroedinger equation in the form of the collision of akhmediev breathers has been reported in @xcite .",
    "the formation of rw in optics has been the subject of intense research since the pioneering work by solli et al . @xcite . since then",
    ", the number of systems in which rogues waves are identified to appear has become important and can be witnessed by recent review papers @xcite .",
    "recently , several studies have indicated that spatially extended systems exhibit rogue waves in the transverse section of the light @xcite .",
    "rogue wave may be generated in anisotropic inhomogeneous nonlinear medium @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to report that the appearance of two - dimensional rogue waves in dissipative systems : driven optical cavities subjected to optical injection and broad - area surface - emitting lasers with saturable absorber .",
    "we propose a mechanism to generate two - dimensioal rogue waves formation by time delayed feedback scheme .",
    "this mechanism has been recently applied successfully in one - dimensional systems @xcite . in the first part of the present paper , we focus on two - dimensional lugiato - lefever model .",
    "we show that depending on the strength of the delay feedback , localized structures become unstable and rogue waves are formed .",
    "the rogue wave formation can occur in the regime where the transmitted intensity as a function of the input intensity is monostable .",
    "we provide a statistical analysis showing a non - gaussian profile of the probability distribution with a long tail and pulse intensity height well beyond two times the significant wave height ( swh ) .",
    "the swh is defined as the mean height of the highest third of waves . in the second part",
    ", we perform the same analysis by using a model describing broad - area surface - emitting laser with saturable absorber .",
    "the generality of our analysis suggests that the instability leading to the spontaneous formation of rogue waves is an universal phenomenon .",
    "it is worth to mention an important theoretical work on rogue waves by akhmediev et al .",
    "@xcite in the framework on schroedinger nonlinear equation . however , we choose two systems that can not be described by the nonlinear schroedinger equation .",
    "this is because the nonlinear schroedinger equation does not admit two - dimensional solutions due to collapse dynamics .    in the case of small area semiconductor laser where the diffraction is neglected , there exist a narrow parameter regions where the laser intensity exhibits high intensity pulses in the time domain @xcite .",
    "when the delay feedback is taken into account temporal rogue waves have been also generated @xcite .",
    "rogue waves as extreme events have been reported in one dimensional systems such as all fiber cavities @xcite and whispering gallery mode resonators @xcite .",
    "more recently , an analysis of rogue waves supported by experimental data in a semiconductor microcavity laser with intracavity saturable absorber has been reported @xcite . in all these works ,",
    "the generation of rogue waves have been studied in strictly one dimensional setting .    in this paper , after an introduction , we characterize in section ii , the formation of rogue waves generated in two - dimensional lugiato - lefever model with a delay feedback . in section iii , we consider a model describing broad - area surface - emitting laser with a saturable absorber with a time delay feedback and we show the occurrence of two - dimensional rogue waves in this system .",
    "we conclude in section vi .",
    "we propose for the first time a mechanism of the formation of two - dimensional spatial rogue waves based on the time delayed feedback control scheme . to illustrate this mechanism we consider a nonlinear passive cavity subjected to time - delayed feedback .",
    "this system is modeled by the well known lugiato - lefever ( ll ) equation that describes a ring cavity filled with a kerr media and driven coherently by an injected signal @xcite .",
    "this model equation is valid under the following approximations :  the cavity possesses a high fresnel number , _ i.e. _ it is a large - aspect - ratio system and we assume that the cavity is much shorter than the diffraction and the nonlinearity spatial scales ; and for the sake of simplicity , we assume a single longitudinal mode operation . we implement in the ll model an optical time - delayed feedback as a single round - trip delay term @xcite . more precisely , we adopt the rosanov @xcite and in the lang and kobayashi @xcite approach to model the time - delay feedback .",
    "the ll model with optical feedback reads : @xmath0.\\label{eq : dedt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath1 is the normalized mean - field cavity electric field and @xmath2 is the frequency detuning parameter .",

    "the curve @xmath12 is either monostable ( @xmath13 ) or bistable ( @xmath14 ) @xcite .",
    "the delay feedback is modelled by an external cavity operating in a self - imaging configuration @xcite .",

    ", the ll model has been derived for other systems such as all fiber cavity @xcite and whispering gallery mode resonators @xcite . in these two systems the diffraction term modeled by the laplace operator",
    "is replaced by chromatic dispersion effect modeled by a second derivative with respect to the retarded time in the reference frame moving with the group velocity of light .",
    "the ll model has also been derived for a cavity with left - handed materials @xcite where diffraction coefficient is negative @xmath18 .     and @xmath19.,width=340 ]",
    "it is well known that in the absence of delay feedback , i.e. @xmath20 , the lugiato - lefever equation admits stationary localized structures in one and two - dimensional settings @xcite similar to those reported in @xcite .",
    "experimental evidence of spatial ls in kerr medium has been realized in @xcite .",
    "we fix all the parameters in lugiato - lefever model and only vary the strength of the delay feedback . in the absence of delay feedback ,",
    "i.e. @xmath20 , a single or multipeak stationary localized structures are formed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cs ] ) .",
    "the occurrence of stationary localized structures does not require a bistable homogeneous response curve .",
    "the prerequisite condition for their formation is the coexistence between a single homogeneous flat solutions and the spatially periodic pattern .",
    "this coexistence occurs in the monostable regime @xcite , i.e. , for @xmath13 . a weakly nonlinear analysis in one @xcite and in two transverse dimensions @xcite have shown that this coexistence occurs when @xmath21 .",
    "in this regime , the relative stability analysis has shown that the only stable periodic pattern in two - dimensions are hexagons , other symmetries are unstable @xcite .",
    "the interaction of well - separated localized structures has been also discussed @xcite    when increasing the value of @xmath22 above @xmath23 , such localized structures exhibit a regular drift with a constant velocity ( not shown ) that has been reported in @xcite .",
    "the delay feedback allows for the motion of stationary localized structure when the product @xmath22 reaches the value of @xmath24 for @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "optical delay feedback may also be at the origin of a drift bifurcation leading to the motion of localized strctures in the lugiato - lefever equation @xcite .",
    "the linear stability of the homogeneous steady states ( hss ) is analyzed by considering small fluctuations around the steady - state that are modulated with transverse wavevector @xmath26 .",
