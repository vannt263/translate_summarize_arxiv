    "unipolar induction ( ui ) is a fundamental electromagnetic process . for astrophysical systems containing a magnetic and a non - magnetic body orbiting around a common center of gravity , a large e.m.f .",
    "is induced across the system by ui when the rotation period of each respective body deviates from one another or from the binary orbital period .",
    "if a magnetized plasma is present in the binary environment , an electric current circuit will be set up .",
    "the dissipation of the electric currents will heat the magnetic object , which may cause an observational signature .",
    "the location where the dissipation occurs depends on the conductivity of the two objects and the nature of the plasma between them ; it also depends on the magnetic - field configuration of the system .",
    "if the electrical conductivity of the two objects is similar , a dipolar magnetic field will lead to strong heating in regions near the field foot - points of the magnetic object , where the current density is the highest , as the electric currents are focused by the converging magnetic field lines .    among all astrophysical ui systems",
    ", the best known system may be the jovian system ( piddington & drake 1968 ; goldreich & lynden - bell 1969 ) .",
    "the currents flowing between the galilean moons and jupiter cause heating on jupiter , resulting in hot spots and trails on jupiter s atmosphere ( connerney et al .",
    "1993 ; clarke et al . 1996 ; 2002 ) . in the jovian system ,",
    "the large - scale magnetic field is provided by jupiter , while volcanism on the moon io may supply the plasma for the conduction of electric currents ( brown 1994 ) .",
    "more recently , two very late - type stars have been found to emit radio emission which varied in its intensity on a period of a few hours , and is polarised and highly variable ( berger et al 2005 , hallinan et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "such properties are consistent with those predicted by the ui model .",
    "it has been suggested that ui processes resembling that found in the jovian system can occur in double degenerate binary systems ( wu et al .",
    "2002 ) , and in degenerate star - planet systems ( li , ferrario & wickramasinghe 1998 ; willes & wu 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "two candidates for ui double degenerate binary systems are the peculiar x - ray sources rx  j0806 + 15 and rx  j1914 + 24 .",
    "these objects show light curves which are modulated on periods of 5.4 and 9.5 min respectively - these periods have widely been taken to represent the binary orbital periods ( ramsay et al 2000 , ramsay , hakala & cropper 2002 , israel et al 2002 ) .",
    "most of the models which have been put forward to account for these systems have two white dwarfs orbiting around a common center of gravity ( eg cropper et al 2004 ) .",
    "wu et al ( 2002 ) proposed that the x - ray emission from both these systems were powered by ui",
    ". since their orbital periods are much shorter than the rotation period of jupiter s satellites , and since the magnetic field of the magnetic white dwarf is much greater than jupiter , the currents are much greater and therefore heat the footpoints to x - ray rather than uv temperatures ( in the case of jupiter ) .",
    "an essence of the ui model for these systems is the large current flows , driven by the induced e.m.f .",
    ", along magnetic field lines connecting the two objects . for a magnetic object with a dipolar field ,",
    "the field lines converge to its magnetic polar regions . in such a field configuration ,",
    "kinetic instabilities such as loss - cone instability can develop easily , leading to electron - cyclotron masers ( wu & lee 1979 ; see also dulk 1985 ) .",
    "moreover , while there is sufficient plasma to provide the charge particles for the current , the plasma density should be low enough to have a low plasma cut - off frequency for the transmission of masers . for double degenerate binaries and stellar planetary systems ,",
    "some harmonics of these masers are in radio wave - bands ( willes & wu 2004 ; willes , wu & kuncic 2005 ) .",
    "moreover , these electron - cyclotron masers are narrowly beamed , have a high brightness temperature ( @xmath3  k ) and are almost 100% circularly polarized . thus , the detection of strongly circularly polarized emission , ( modulated at the orbital period ) , would provide an unambiguous proof of the presence of ui in these compact systems .",
    "we sought evidence of ui in various astrophysical systems . these include the systems rx  j0806 + 15 and",
    "rx  j1914 + 24 and as a control , we also observed the ultra - compact system es  cet which has an orbital period of 10.3 min ( warner & woudt 2002 ) and shows clear evidence of accretion ( espaillat et al . 2005 ) . while the presence of an accretion flow should suppress ui , it is interesting to search for radio emission around such short period binaries .",
    "our other target was gliese 876 ( gj 876 ) which is a dm4 star at a distance of 4.7 pc with 3 known planets .",
    "gj 876d has an orbital period of 1.94 days and has a mass of @xmath4 ( rivera et al 2005 ) .",
    "if the planet gj 876d has a negligible magnetic field and a metallic core , ui could occur which may drive electron cyclotron maser emission , analogous to the jovian system . on the other hand",
    "if gj 876d has a substantial surface magnetic field , its field will interact directly with the field of the host star and shield its core from being threaded by the field lines of its dm4 host - star . in this case",
    ", field reconnection may lead to particle acceleration , and any radio emission would probably be due to synchrotron radiation and not electron cyclotron maser emission . while the radiation would be expected to be linearly polarized , we would not expect a clear periodicity related to its orbital motion , unless the emission region is localised and eclipsed for a fraction of the orbit .",
    "willes , wu & kuncic ( 2004 ) presented calculations for the peak radio flux expected from ultra - compact binaries such as rx  j0806 + 15 and rx  j1914 + 24 . for systems with orbital periods in the range 510 min ,",
    "the optimum observing frequency is close to 5 ghz ( 6 cm ) . for terrestrial planets orbiting around a low - mass magnetic star ,",
    "the ui model described in willes & wu ( 2005 ) predicted that the peak frequency is likely to be between 50500 ghz ( 0.66 mm ) although this was rather uncertain .",
    "es cet and gj 876 were observed using the australian telescope compact array ( atca ) in new south wales , australia .",
    "rx  j0806 + 15 and rx  j1914 + 24 were observed using the very large array ( vla ) in new mexico , usa .",
    "we obtained full polarisation information , with the intention of determining the fractional polarisation of any detected source .",
    "the observation log is shown in table [ log ] . in each case , observations took place at two adjacent frequency bands ; this provides an increase in sensitivity by a factor of @xmath5 when imaged altogether .",
    "all data were reduced using standard flagging , calibration and imaging routines within the miriad and aips packages for the atca and vla observations respectively .",
    "we determined the rms noise level in regions of sky near the known position of each source .",
    "we set upper limits on the flux density to be three times the rms noise level .",
    "for the one source from which we detected radio emission ( rx j0806 + 15 ; see section 3.3 ) , the integrated flux density was obtained by performing a 2-d gaussian fit to the image .",
    ".the log for the radio observations presented here .",
    "the australian telescope compact array is located in narrabri , australia , while the very large array is located in new mexico , usa . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     ( 14,10 ) ( -2.5,0 )",
    "although ui is believed to operate in various astrophysical systems , it has still to be determined if ui is an efficient process in double degenerate binary systems and in magnetised stellar planetary systems . for double degenerate binaries",
    "there is an important issue regarding the consequences of ui operation , as it may affect the system s energy budget , and hence the orbital dynamics and evolution ( wu et al . 2002 ; dallosso , israel & stella 2006 ) .",
    "moreover , it will also alter the properties of the gravitational wave emission from these binaries , which are expected to be detected in large number by the proposed _",
    "lisa _ gravitational observatory ( see e.g. nelemans , yungelson & portegies zwart 2006 ) .",
    "it is therefore important to verify and assess the role of ui in compact magnetic binary systems .",
    "the nature of the dominant emission process driving the electromagnetic radiation from rx  j0806 + 15 and rx  j1914 + 24 is not fully known .",
    "while the ui model has successfully accounted for many of the observational properties of these two systems ( eg dallosso , israel & stella 2007 ) , there are a number of properties which will require modification of the generic ui model , which assumes a dipole magnetic field .",
    "for instance , it is questionable whether a dipole field can reproduce , in detail , the phase - offset between the x - ray and optical data ( barros et al . 2007 ) .",
    "further , a higher - order magnetic field component needs to be present in order to produce the x - ray and optical light curve profile ( barros et al . 2005 ) .",
    "therefore , we need more direct , alternative evidence to verify the role of ui in contrast to other processes , such as accretion , in these systems .    in this work",
    "we have searched for radio emission from two sources which are believed to be the two most compact binaries yet known .",
    "if a magnetic field is present , the electro - magnetic interaction between the two stars is expected to be stronger than found in magnetic cataclysmic variables , rs  cvn or magnetic algols , because of the small separation between the stars and the rapid orbital rotation ( eg chanmugam & dulk 1982 , retter , richards & wu 2005 ) .",
    "the detection of radio emission , regardless of its coherence or incoherence , will provide strong evidence of magnetic interaction , and the detection of high brightness circularly polarized emission would confirm the operation of ui on a global scale .",
    "our observations of es  cet showed a null detection .",
    "the lack of detectable radio emission is not particularly surprising .",
    "es  cet is an ultra - compact binary in which mass transfer occurs via an accretion flow .",
    "the presence of an accretion flow also inhibits any large scale current circuit , thus , a global ui process as described in wu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) can not arise .",
    "although one can not exclude ui operating in a very small local scale , its effects on the orbital dynamics and on other observational characteristics are not expected to be significant as in other ultra - compact binaries with accretion flows .",
    "as loss - cone or other kinetic instabilities can not develop in accreting systems , es  cet is not expected to be a maser source .",
    "the presence of high - density material would imply a high plasma - cutoff frequency . for a plasma with electron number density of @xmath6@xmath7",
    ", the plasma frequency will be well above 5  ghz , thus it will prevent the propagation of 6 cm radio emission , which is the observational band of our atca observation .",
    "our observations do not show evidence of radio emission from rx  j1914 + 24 at a limit of 42  @xmath8jy .",
    "one obvious possibility is that ui may not occur in this system .",
    "however , the non - detection does not rule ui out . as pointed out in willes & wu ( 2004 )",
    "the observability of electron - cyclotron masers from a ui double - degenerate compact binary depends on the magnetic moment of the magnetic white dwarf ( which determines the frequencies of the cyclotron harmonics ) , the amount of thermal electrons filling the electric - current flowing magnetic flux tubes , the temperature of these thermal electrons , and the viewing orientation of the binary .",
    "calculations showed that the radio emission is detectable in a restrictive region in the parameter space of ui double - degenerate compact binaries .",
    "thus , even if ui is operating efficiently and electron - cyclotron masers are generated in all systems in an ensemble , some systems will show detectable electron - cyclotron masers in the radio wavebands , while a significant fraction of the systems will show null detection in a radio survey .",
    "we have detected a radio source at a position coincident with the known optical position of rx  j0806 + 15 .",
    "although we can not completely exclude that this is a chance alignment between the known position of rx  j0806 + 15 and an artifact in the data reduction process , the fact that it was detected at a significance level of 5.8@xmath0 and that the radio source was variable suggests that it is more likely that rx  0806 + 15 is a transient radio source .    with these caveats in mind , we can determine the brightness temperature @xmath9 of a source by :    @xmath10    the distance of rx  j0806 + 15 is not well known , with israel et al ( 2003 ) noting that the distance to the edge of the galaxy is 500 pc , while barros et al ( 2007 ) estimate that its distance is greater than 1.1 kpc implying it is out of the galactic plane . assuming a conservative distance of 500  pc and that the size of the emission region is @xmath11 cm ( the linear extension of the foot - point flux - tube for systems with a non - magnetic white dwarf companion with mass 0.5 m@xmath12 , see willes & wu 2004 ) , the observed flux density of 99@xmath8jy implies @xmath13k .",
    "there are some uncertainties about the exact size of the foot - point emission region . even if we assume that the size of the emission region is @xmath14 cm , ( the radius of a 0.5 m@xmath12 white dwarf ) , we still obtain a very high brightness temperature , @xmath15k .",
    "such a high brightness temperature can not be explained by non - thermal synchrotron process , which would be limited to @xmath16k ( dulk & marsh 1982 ) .",
    "it also can not be explained by any incoherent radiation processes , as they are limited to @xmath17k by inverse compton cooling ( kellerman & pauliny - toth 1969 ) .",
    "therefore , the radio emission must be generated by a coherent radiative process , such as an electron - cyclotron maser as predicted by the unipolar - induction model ( wu et al .",
    "2002 ) . in the maser model described in willes & wu ( 2004 ) ,",
    "the transient or bursting nature of the source may be explained by variations in the emission - cone beaming direction or by the presence of a small amount of non - thermal electrons whose density fluctuate . to confirm the nature of the radio source we urge further observations of this source at radio wavelengths to determine how often it shows radio emission and to better constrain the upper limit on the circular polarisation .",
    "the fact that we did not detect any evidence for radio emission from gj 876 does not rule out the operation of ui in this system .",
    "our observations of gj 876 took place at 12 mm .",
    "the calculations of willes & wu ( 2005 ) suggest that any radio emission due to the ui operation would more likely be observable at shorter wavelengths .",
    "sensitive observations at these wavelengths ( @xmath186 mm ) will be possible using alma .",
    "the australia telescope is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by the csiro .",
    "the national radio astronomy observatory is a facility of the national science foundation of the usa , operated under cooperative agreement by associated universities , inc .",
