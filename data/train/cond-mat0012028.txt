    "a theoretical framework for constructing model many - body systems that can exhibit phases with fractionalized quantum numbers has been proposed by senthil and fisher.@xcite here , we report results obtained from a numerical simulation of one such model and examine a recently proposed experimental test for detecting the fractionalized phase.@xcite    the quantum many - body model that we will study consists of `` chargons '' coupled to a fluctuating @xmath0 gauge field in two spatial dimensions .",
    "it was obtained by senthil and fisher by considering the special case of @xmath1-wave pairing with an even number of electrons per unit cell , and integrating out the spinon degrees of freedom .",
    "this model has the advantage of being straightforward to simulate , while allowing a test of some of the underlying ideas associated with the fractionalized phases .",

    "the gauge field operator on the link between nearest - neighbor sites @xmath7 and @xmath8 is @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the product of gauge operators around a plaquette .",
    "the sum @xmath11 is over nearest neighbor sites on the 2d spatial lattice .",
    "a `` vison '' excitation consists of a plaquette for which @xmath10 is equal to @xmath12 .",
    "visons are always joined in pairs by a string of plaquettes with two links flipped relative to the rest of the links in the vicinity .",
    "a schematic example of this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : visons](a ) . here and in the text , we have taken the flipped links to have @xmath13 for definiteness .",
    "for the purpose of carrying out simulations , we work with the 3d ( two space and one euclidean time ) classical action associated with the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ qham ] ) , @xmath14 . \\label{oneone}\\ ] ] this action has an @xmath15 angular variable @xmath16 corresponding to the eigenvalue of the operator @xmath5 and a @xmath0 gauge field @xmath17 corresponding to the eigenvalue of the operator @xmath9 . here",
    ", @xmath11 indicates all nearest neighbor sites on the 3d lattice .",
    "this action has rotational symmetry as well as a local @xmath0-gauge symmetry in which @xmath16 at a site transforms to @xmath18 and all of the @xmath19 gauge fields linked to the @xmath20 site change sign . as discussed in ref .",
    ", this model is expected to have the type of phase diagram illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] .",
    "both the gauge field @xmath19 and the @xmath15 field @xmath16 are disordered in region i when @xmath21 and @xmath22 are small . in the 2d quantum version ,",
    "this corresponds to the fluctuating @xmath9 gauge field confining the chargons so that there are no free @xmath23 excitations , only @xmath24 excitations . in region",
    "iii , the @xmath15 rotation symmetry is broken , as well as the @xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "this is just the usual @xmath15 phase with a finite helicity modulus . here",
    ", chargon pairs @xmath24 condense to form a superfluid .",
    "region ii corresponds to a `` fractionalized '' ( unconfined ) phase .",
    "we find that the @xmath25 field is disordered , as in region i , but the @xmath0 gauge field is ordered , or equivalently in the quantum version , the visons are gapped.@xcite this allows the chargon pairs to `` fractionate , '' and individual @xmath23 chargon excitations are present in the quantum version .",
    "as one enters the superconducting phase , region iii , it is the @xmath23 field that condenses .",
    "the fractionalized phase , region ii , is characterized by a `` topological '' order .",
    "that is , on a manifold with a non - trivial topology , the ground state of the 2d quantum system has a degeneracy that depends upon the topology . with periodic boundary conditions the 2d quantum system has the topology of a torus .",
    "a non - trivial topological excitation occurs if a string of plaquettes with two flipped links associated with a vison pair cuts through the torus , as illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : visons](b ) . in order to minimize the energy ,",
    "the @xmath25 field has a discontinuity of @xmath26 ( mod @xmath27 ) across the flipped links denoted by the dashed lines of fig .",
    "[ fig : visons](b ) . because the @xmath25 field does not have long - range order in region ii , this disturbance dies out within a correlation length , and its energy",
    "does not grow with the lattice size .",
    "when a vison loop threads the 3d torus used in our simulations , this topological configuration is trapped because the free energy barrier the system must go over to reach the no - vison state grows as the lattice size , @xmath28 , which goes to infinity in the bulk limit . as proposed by senthil and fisher , the existence of this topological order can be probed by driving this system into the superfluid state iii , where the @xmath25 field does have long - range order . in this case , when a trapped vison is present in region ii and the system is driven from region ii to region iii ( by , for example , increasing @xmath21 ) , the @xmath26 phase shift in @xmath25 associated with the vison will induce a circulating current of bosons.@xcite thus , by going into the superconducting phase iii one can look for trapped visons by measuring the boson current .",
    "if they exist , the trapped visons tell us that we have come from a `` fractionalized '' phase .",
    "abelian gauge theories have been studied extensively by high - energy physicists since the earliest days of lattice gauge theory.@xcite the work most closely related to our own is the study of the abelian higgs model with a @xmath0 gauge field coupled to an ising matter field,@xcite and a @xmath29 gauge field coupled to an @xmath15-matter field.@xcite here we study a @xmath0 gauge field coupled to an @xmath15 field .",
    "more recently , an action similar to that of eq .  [ oneone ] , but with an @xmath30 matter field , was used by lammert , rokhsar , and toner to study a classical model for nematics.@xcite    the existence of three distinct phases in the model we study is consistent with conclusions drawn from the study of more general abelian higgs models , in which the higgs field is not in the fundamental representation of the gauge group.@xcite in particular , as pointed out by senthil and fisher@xcite , each of the phases discussed here has an analogue in the @xmath30 model of nematics.@xcite by contrast , the @xmath0 gauge theory coupled to an ising matter field has only a confined and a deconfined phase with the higgs and confined phases being analytically connected,@xcite as is expected in general for abelian higgs theories in which the matter field is in the fundamental representation of the gauge group.@xcite    in section 2 , we will discuss monte carlo results for the polyakov loop ( the product of @xmath19 wrapped periodically around the lattice ) and the helicity modulus that give us numerical results for the phase diagram . then in section 3 , we will discuss visons and the senthil - fisher test for fractionalization .",

    "using the 3d euclidean action , we measure the polyakov loop and the helicity modulus to find the transitions in both the gauge field and the bosonic field . on our lattices",
    "the polyakov loop provides a useful probe of the gauge field , as we will discuss .",
    "the helicity modulus measures the stiffness of the bosonic field to rotating the spins . it can indicate the phase of the boson field , since in our @xmath15 spin formulation the superconducting state is characterized by a finite spin stiffness .    it is well known that for @xmath32 the action of eq .  [ oneone ] gives rise to a second - order phase transition on an infinite three - dimensional lattice.@xcite the confined ( strong coupling ) phase is characterized by area law behavior of the wilson loops , and the deconfined ( weak coupling ) phase by perimeter law behavior .",
    "however , on a finite lattice there is a cross - over , rather than a _ bona fide _ phase transition . for the relatively small lattices on which we perform our simulations , measurement of the polyakov loop provides a convenient way to locate the cross - over .",
    "a polyakov loop is the product of a line of @xmath19 wrapped periodically around the lattice , @xmath33 where all the links are pointing in the @xmath34 direction . for strong coupling",
    "it vanishes order by order in perturbation theory , and in our simulations we find that it fluctuates about zero , as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : polymc1 ] . at weak coupling an expansion about the state in which all the @xmath19 have the same sign gives , to leading order,@xcite @xmath35 where @xmath28 is the number of lattice points in the temporal direction",
    ". a reference state in which the polyakov loop has the same magnitude , but opposite sign , can be obtained by the addition of a vison through the torus that flips all the links in the temporal direction between two adjacent time slices . by tracking @xmath36 in our simulations",
    ", we observe the system tunneling between these two degenerate states , as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : polymc2 ] . on our finite lattice @xmath36 averages to zero because of cancellations between states in which it takes on positive and negative values , but above the transition the tunneling occurs much less frequently than our period of observation so that we obtain a non - zero average .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "[ expfalloff ] that for @xmath37 the jump in @xmath36 goes to zero .",
    "however , in our simulations , @xmath38 , and the cross - over is in the neighborhood of @xmath39 .",
    "for these values the magnitude of the polyakov loop at the crossover is approximately @xmath40 .",
    "we then measured the polyakov loop along lines of constant @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "figure [ fig : poly ] shows the expectation value of polyakov loops along lines of constant @xmath22 .",
    "these monte carlo measurements were taken using a local metropolis updating scheme on a lattice with @xmath41 sites .",
    "we took 150 measurements for each point with each measurement separated by 35 monte carlo updates of the lattice .",
    "after the measurements at a point are done , @xmath21 is increased and the system is allowed to equilibrate for 200 monte carlo updates . in this case , each run is started with the system completely ordered so that no vison loops get frozen into the system .",
    "figure [ fig : polyj ] shows the expectation value of polyakov loops along lines of constant @xmath21 .",
    "the measurements were taken in the same way with @xmath22 increased during the run instead of @xmath21 .",
    "additionally , 500 monte carlo steps were used in between measurements to equilibrate . for this figure",
    "each run is started from a completely disordered state .",
    "when the system enters the deconfined phase ( ii ) from the confined phase ( i ) it has the opportunity to trap a vison . a trapped vison changes the expectation value of the polyakov loop from @xmath42 to @xmath12 and accounts for the run with @xmath43 .",
    "the standard form of the helicity modulus for the @xmath15 model is not invariant under the @xmath0 gauge transformation .",
    "it can be made gauge invariant by inserting factors of the gauge field .",
    "this gives a helicity modulus of the form @xmath44 where @xmath34 points along the bonds in the @xmath45 , @xmath46 , or @xmath47 directions and @xmath48 is a unit vector pointing from the @xmath20 lattice site to the @xmath49 lattice site . since the helicity modulus measures the stiffness of the spins , it is @xmath50 where the bosons are disordered and finite where the bosons have long - range order.@xcite the helicity modulus measured along lines of constant @xmath22 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : helmod ] .",
    "these measurements were taken in the same way as the measurements of the polyakov loop : 150 measurements at each point separated by 35 monte carlo steps between measurements and 200 monte carlo measurements between points .",
    "the transition is rounded due to finite size effects .",
    "the results found by looking at the expectation value of the helicity modulus and the polyakov loop were used to construct the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] .",
    "the transitions were taken to be when the observable is statistically non - zero .",
    "the nature of the transition between the deconfined phase and the confined phase and between the deconfined phase and the condensed phase are understood from studying the ising model and the xy model , and the boundary between the confining phase and the condensed phase has been studied by senthil and fisher.@xcite this is a transition at which both the gauge field and the boson field order .",
    "this phase transition occurs down to @xmath51 where there is no plaquette term in the action , implying that it is the ordering of the bosons that forces the gauge field to order .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the fractionalized phase ii has a topological order caused by the presence of visons threading the torus .",
    "these visons are trapped , as previously noted .",
    "senthil and fisher recently proposed a method for detecting trapped visons by driving the system between the fractionalized phase ii and phase iii , in which the @xmath25 field is condensed.@xcite in our numerical experiments the presence of visons can be determined by observables such as the polyakov loop that measure the gauge field directly , while in real - world systems this is typically not possible .",
    "it is therefore necessary to be able to determine the topological order without observing the gauge field directly .",
    "however , as discussed by senthil and fisher , the boson field can be used to probe the topology on the lattice in the condensed phase , in which it has long - range order .",
    "anti - periodic boundary conditions generated by a vison threading the torus cause the bosons to gradually twist by @xmath52 from one side of the vison string to the other .",
    "this gives rise to a non - zero gauge invariant current , @xmath53 which can be measured .",
    "here @xmath34 is a spatial unit vector perpendicular to the vison string . in this way ,",
    "measuring the gauge - invariant current can determine the topological order of the lattice .",
    "thus , when a single vison string threads the torus we expect a boson current to flow corresponding to the @xmath26 change in the phase produced by the vison .",
    "in the ordered phase , the fluctuations in the boson phase lead to a renormalization of j , @xmath54 as the bare coupling @xmath21 increases and one goes deep into the boson condensed phase , the phase fluctuations decrease and @xmath55 goes to @xmath42 . in a real physical measurement , the quantity entering the circulation or flux is the renormalized coupling @xmath56 , so that a measurement of @xmath57 gives @xmath58 . for a finite @xmath59 lattice",
    "we expect that when a vison is trapped and the system is switched into the condensed boson phase iii by increasing @xmath21 , one will find @xmath60 which goes to @xmath61 as @xmath28 goes to infinity .",
    "the lattice is initially prepared at @xmath62 and @xmath63 in the condensed phase with a single vison string threading the torus and a gradual twist of the bosons by @xmath26 . in a real - world system , this would be achieved by threading an @xmath64 magnetic flux quantum through the sample.@xcite if the system is then moved to the fractionalized phase by decreasing @xmath21 to @xmath65 , the boson current disappears , but the vison remains trapped so that the boson current returns with the same magnitude if the system is moved back to the condensed phase .",
    "we have done this numerically on an @xmath41 lattice using our euclidean action , with the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : visa ] .",
    "here we have plotted @xmath66 and we see that this ratio is non - zero in the condensed phase , signifying the presence of a vison that remains trapped in the fractionalized phase . for @xmath62 and @xmath63 on an @xmath41 , lattice @xmath55 is measured to be @xmath67 so that @xmath68 in agreement with fig .  [",
    "fig : visa ] . note that the boson current can be either positive or negative reflecting the direction of the gradual twist induced by the vison .",
    "if the system with a single trapped vison is moved to a phase without fractionalization , the confined phase i , the vison can escape .",
    "for example , at @xmath69 and @xmath70 we have prepared the system in the condensed phase with a single vison string threading the torus and a boson current , as shown over the first @xmath71 sweeps in fig .",
    "[ fig : visb ] . for @xmath69 and @xmath70 on an @xmath41 lattice @xmath55 is measured to be @xmath72 , so that initially @xmath73 .",
    "then the system is taken into the confined phase i by decreasing @xmath21 to @xmath65 at constant @xmath69 .",
    "when , after another @xmath71 monte carlo steps , the system is taken back into the boson condensed phase iii by increasing @xmath21 to @xmath74 , the boson current is seen to vanish .",
    "this means that the vison that was initially trapped in the condensed phase escaped when @xmath21 was decreased to @xmath65 with @xmath69 .",
    "the boson current remains zero through further cyclings between the phases .",
    "this measurement shows that @xmath75 corresponds to a point in the confined phase .",
    "this type of measurement can also be used to determine the line separating the confined and fractionalized phases .",
    "we can determine whether a given point in the phase diagram @xmath76 , is in the fractionalized or confined phase by the following set of measurements .",
    "we start by equilibrating a trapped vison at the point @xmath77 , which we know to be in the fractionalized phase for sufficiently small @xmath78 .",
    "we next decrease @xmath22 to @xmath79 , equilibrate the system , and then increase @xmath22 back to @xmath42 , where we again equilibrate the system .",
    "finally we move to @xmath80 , a point at which we know the bosons are condensed .",
    "if @xmath81 is in the confined phase , then the trapped vison will escape ; however , the system may trap visons when re - entering the fractionalized phase .",
    "if an odd number of visons are trapped , there will be a non - zero bosonic current in the condensed phase , while if an even number of vison are trapped , no bosonic current will flow in the condensed phase .",
    "thus we expect to find a current in @xmath82 of the runs . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath83 is in the fractionalized phase , then the initial vison will remain trapped , and a non - zero current will be observed in the condensed phase .",
    "figure  [ fig : vescape ] shows the fraction of @xmath84 trials in which we observed a trapped vison for @xmath85 and at different values of @xmath79 .",
    "the time to equilibrate the lattice in the condensed phase was highly variable because of false energy minima created by trapping several visons .",
    "the system has probability @xmath86 of trapping an odd number of visons in moving from the confined phase to the fractionalized phase , but when the system is kept in the fractionalized phase the initial vison remains trapped .",
    "the transition is rounded due to visons tunneling out of the finite torus close to the transition .",
    "in this paper we have reported on an investigation of the xy model coupled to a @xmath0 gauge field using monte carlo techniques .",
    "this model was proposed by senthil and fisher for the study of fractionalization . by observing the polyakov loop and the helicity modulus ,",
    "we have determined the structure of the phase diagram of the theory .",
    "in addition , we considered an experiment proposed by senthil and fisher to determine the existence of a fractionalized phase . using phase iii , in which the bosons are condensed , to measure the existence of a vison",
    ", we see that the vison remains trapped in the fractionalized phase .",
    "a vison that was trapped in the phase iii region is able to escape when the system is taken into the confined phase i.    we would like to thank m.p.a .",
