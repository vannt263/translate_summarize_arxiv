    "the control of the interaction via resonances in atomic and molecular many - body systems is of major importance in the field of ultracold quantum gases .",
    "magnetic and optical feshbach resonances are well established tools of experimentally tuning the interactions of atomic ensembles @xcite . in recent years , however , an alternative way of controlling the inter - particle correlations has attracted increasing interest : the confinement - induced resonance ( cir ) @xcite .",
    "it emerges due to the interplay of atom - atom scattering with the tightly confining geometry of the trap , and yields drastic changes of the scattering process and its properties @xcite .",
    "cirs have been extensively studied e.g. in the context of three - body @xcite and four - body @xcite scattering in a confining potential , of p - wave scattering of fermions @xcite , of scattering in mixed dimensions @xcite or multichannel scattering in cylindrical confinement @xcite .",
    "for distinguishable atoms , two major effects are the so - called dual cir yielding a complete suppression of quantum scattering , and resonant molecule formation in tight waveguides @xcite .",
    "remarkable experimental progress has lead to the observation of cirs for both bosons @xcite and fermions @xcite , relying on the control of s - wave and p - wave interactions in bosonic and fermionic low - dimensional systems , respectively .",
    "it is an intriguing perspective to extend the resonant scattering physics to higher partial wave interactions in quantum gases , since the latter is expected to provide novel many - body phenomena .",
    "a promising example is the possibility that higher partial wave interactions are responsible for high - temperature superconductivity and superfluidity @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we suggest a novel mechanism for resonant higher partial - wave interatomic interactions in bosonic quantum gases , based on the effect of resonant d - wave interactions for ultracold collisions in tightly confining waveguides .",
    "we provide a resonance condition implying the dependence of the position of the d - wave resonance ( dwr ) on the oscillator length @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the confinement frequency ) of the harmonic waveguide .",
    "it is shown that this condition does not depend on the short - range part of the interatomic interaction but on the long - range part via the dispersion coefficient @xmath2 .",
    "additionally , the strength of the d - wave interactions can be controlled by changing the width @xmath3 of the waveguide , as it is the case for s - wave scattering . due to the fact that dwrs occur in the background of s - wave cirs ,",
    "an adjustment of the trap width can change entirely the nature of the underlying interactions of the colliding atoms from s- to d - wave and vice versa .",
    "we find that the dwr observed here is based on a shape resonance formed in the presence of both the centrifugal barrier and the confining trap .",
    "we consider ultracold collisions of identical bosons in a harmonic waveguide with a transverse potential @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the latter permits a separation of the center of mass and relative motion yielding the following hamiltonian for the relative motion : @xmath6 @xmath7 is the interatomic potential , where @xmath8 is the relative radial coordinate and @xmath9 is the reduced mass of the two bosons .",
    "the boundary conditions for quasi-1d scattering in the waveguide read , for @xmath10 , @xmath11\\phi_{0,0}(r\\sin\\theta ) \\label{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the elastic scattering amplitude of the ground transversal channel , @xmath13 is the ground - state wave - function of the 2d harmonic oscillator with transversal energy @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the relative momentum of the colliding pair , and @xmath16 is the energy of the relative two - body motion written as a sum of the longitudinal @xmath17 and transversal @xmath18 energies .",
    "we focus on the single mode regime for which the energy lies below the first excited transversal energy level , @xmath19 . obviously , the scattering state ( [ 2 ] ) is parity @xmath20 symmetric , corresponding to the case of two colliding identical bosons .",
    "the hamiltonian allows for a separation of the azimuthal motion , corresponding to the conservation of the projection of the angular momentum onto the symmetry axis of the waveguide .",
    "consequently , we obtain a 2d scattering problem [ eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and([2 ] ) ] in spherical coordinates , which is solved by employing the discrete - variable method suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite , with the radial part of the schrdinger equation discretized using a b - spline basis @xcite .",
    "the interatomic interaction @xmath7 is modeled via the lennard - jones 6 - 12 potential @xmath21 .",
    "we hereafter employ the units @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the mass of the cs atom and @xmath24 mhz in si units .",
    "the following investigations are performed for the dispersion coefficients @xmath2 defining the long - range part of the interatomic potential for three different atomic species , cs , rb and sr @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal energy is set to @xmath25 and the transversal energy is varied within the interval @xmath26 , corresponding to a range @xmath27 ( si ) for the waveguide confinement frequency .",
    "we thereby focus on the low energy regime , characterized by @xmath28 .     in the waveguide and ( c ) interaction strength @xmath29 as a function of the parameter @xmath30 ( @xmath31 for cs ) .",
    "]    important quantities of our analysis are the scattering amplitude @xmath12 and the transmission coefficient @xmath32 which we analyze in the limit of very small longitudinal collision energies for which the s - wave cir was initially defined @xcite .",
    "let us first briefly address free space cs - cs collisions ( @xmath31 @xcite ) in the energy range for which s - wave scattering dominates the elastic scattering process . by varying @xmath30 ( which changes the short range part of the interatomic interaction )",
    "we observe s- and d - wave resonances in the corresponding partial cross sections [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] . as expected , the width of the d - wave resonance is by orders of magnitude smaller than that of the s - wave resonance . in the presence of the waveguide",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] the free near resonant s - wave scattering turns into a s - wave confinement - induced resonance @xcite , which appears as a broad dip in the transmission coefficient with a zero - valued minimum at @xmath33 , coinciding with a divergence of the interaction strength @xmath34 . in order to compare the numerically calculated position of the s - wave cir with the analytical result",
    "@xcite we map the @xmath30 parameter onto the s - wave scattering length @xmath35 in free space and obtain the ratio @xmath36 which is in good agreement with the analytical prediction @xmath37 .",
    "the d - wave resonance persists also in the waveguide , where it appears as a strongly varying transmission coefficient between the limiting values 0 and 1 on top of the s - wave scattering background [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] . as in the case of the s - wave cir",
    ", we observe a divergence of @xmath29 at the resonant value @xmath38 [ fig .",

    "the transversal confinement leads to a shift of the d - wave resonance when passing from free space to confined scattering , as is clearly seen in the high resolution graph of fig .",
    "this shift , as well as the corresponding width , increase with the trap frequency @xmath1 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ] .",
    "we also observe a strong suppression of the s - wave background with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "the above behavior of the transmission coefficient @xmath39,@xmath40 under the action of the confining potential can be interpreted in terms of a strong coupling of s- and d - waves in harmonic traps , since the trap potential can be represented as a sum of the legendre polynomials : @xmath41 \\label{4}\\ ] ] consequently , the confining potential induces a coupling between partial waves @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the course of the atomic collisions in the trap .",
    "this coupling can be tuned by changing the trap frequency .     and",

    "we now analyze more precisely the condition for the occurrence of the dwr .",
    "the experimental determination of the d - wave scattering length and in particular of the position of the corresponding resonance is a difficult task .",
    "however , in the following we will show the existence of a very useful scaling relation for the position of the dwr that provides us with an accurate estimate of its position .",
    "let us firstly introduce the quantity @xmath49 , which is the free space s - wave scattering length @xmath35 at the position of the free space d - wave shape resonance .",
    "this is well defined since @xmath35 in general varies smoothly in the vicinity of the d - wave resonance ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "similarly in @xcite the crucial role of @xmath50 for the analysis of the ultracold scattering near the shape resonances in free space was shown .",
    "we denote its value @xmath51 in free space by @xmath52 .",
    "the next step is to determine the shift @xmath53 of the position of the dwr in the waveguide @xmath54 with respect to the resonance position in free space , in the limit @xmath55 .",
    "note that @xmath35 is altered here by varying the @xmath30 parameter , while experimentally it may be achieved by employing e.g. magnetic feshbach resonances @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) we show the dependence of the quotient @xmath56 on @xmath57 for the three different atomic species cs , rb and sr with corresponding @xmath58 coefficients @xcite . by fitting the numerical data we find this dependence to be rather accurately described by the linear relation @xmath59 for a comparatively broad range of values of @xmath1 for all considered @xmath58 coefficients .",
    "this shows that the quotient @xmath60 changes with the confinement strength independently of the type of colliding atomic species .",
    "in contrast to the s - wave cir , whose position depends exclusively on the ratio @xmath61 , the shift @xmath62 of the dwr depends additionally on the dispersion coefficient @xmath2 .",
    "this is because the van - der - waals potential tail determines the width of the centrifugal barrier ( absent in s - wave scattering ) , which in turn strongly influences the dwr state .",
    "note that @xmath60 possesses the correct asymptotic value @xmath63 in the limiting case of scattering in free space . additionally , a fitting of experimental data with the eq .",

    "varying @xmath1 ( @xmath3 ) changes the transmission coefficient @xmath80 near the dwr and accordingly , and so the strength of the d - wave interaction between the bosons can be tuned . in order to further illustrate this we show in fig .",

    "a weak anisotropy is observed far from resonance whereas strong anisotropy characterizes the density profile close to resonance [ fig .",

    "we emphasize the principal difference in the resonant behavior of the transmission coefficient near the s - wave cir and dwr [ see figs .",
    "[ fig1](b ) and  [ fig6 ] ] . near the s - wave cir",
    "the contribution of d - wave scattering is negligible with respect to the total 1d scattering amplitude .",
    "however , near the dwr the d- and s - wave scattering states are strongly coupled and their interference lead to a sharp variation in the transmission coefficient between unity and zero , characterized by the fano asymmetric lineshape @xcite . changing",

    "[ fig2](b ) provides us with the values of the @xmath30 parameter for each @xmath1 at resonance , which we then use in the 3d scattering problem to extract the corresponding free space resonant energies @xmath84 .",

    "this allows us to the conclude upon the stability of the position of the near - threshold d - wave resonance @xmath84 while adding the trap potential ( see fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] for the following discussion ) . behind the centrifugal barrier ( @xmath86 )",
    "the trapping potential only slightly shifts the interatomic spectrum @xmath87 for @xmath88 .",

    "thus , it becomes clear that for transforming this weakly - bound state into the dwr it has to be shifted in order to lead to an energetically degeneracy with the threshold of the transversal ground state , yielding then @xmath95 .",
    "the latter is here achieved [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ] by altering the @xmath30 coefficient .",
    "experimentally , it can be realized by the magnetic feshbach resonance technique .",
    "further , one can control the appearance of the dwr exclusively by tuning the trap frequency @xmath1 to arrive at the resonance condition @xmath96 without altering the interatomic interaction @xmath7 .",
    "the above analysis also explains the increase of the width of the dwr with increasing @xmath30 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ] due to a corresponding decrease of the relevant width of the centrifugal barrier .",

    "it is controllable by adjusting the frequency of the trap .",
    "the confinement plays here a two - fold role : it can control the strength of the interactions among the bosons as well as alter the nature of the interactions from s- to d - wave character .",
    "the dwr effect can be analyzed and exploited in experiments analogous to @xcite with the help of the scaling relation ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "the observation and application of it in anisotropic waveguides represents an intriguing perspective , since in the limit of the quasi-2d regime the anisotropic profile of the d - wave interactions can be exploited to introduce novel properties into quantum gases , or more specifically speaking , strongly correlated bosonic systems .",
