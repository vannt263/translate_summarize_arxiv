    "let @xmath4 be the finite dimensional density matrix of the clock at time @xmath5 . since it is assumed to be a closed physical system it is evolving according to the evolution @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the clock s hamiltonian .    for the following reason it is not possible to extract any information about @xmath5 without disturbing the state @xmath4 if no prior knowledge about @xmath5 is given .",
    "consider two states @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "following @xcite we conclude that a measurement distinguishing between those states can be implemented without changing the states if and only if the following condition holds : let @xmath10 be the decomposition of the clock s hilbert space into those maximal subspaces that are invariant under the action of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath11 and @xmath12 be the corresponding block matrices of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "then there exists a number @xmath13 such that @xmath14 .",
    "an appropriate observable for the distinction is for example the projection onto the hilbert space @xmath15 .",
    "this gives a rule for constructing disturbance free measurements if we are sure that either @xmath16 or @xmath17 by prior knowledge .",
    "if nothing is known about the time we have to find common invariant subspaces of all @xmath4 . those have clearly to be invariant under the action of @xmath7 .",
    "but the trace of the block matrices on those dynamically invariant subspaces is conserved .",
    "there is hence no way to gain information about @xmath5 without disturbing the system .",
    "the derivation of quantitative bounds on minimal disturbance is a difficult task .",
    "the information about @xmath5 has to be quantified as well as the disturbance .",
    "note that the statement that there is no extraction of information about @xmath5 relies essentially on the continuity of @xmath5 .",
    "the necessary and sufficient condition above allows to construct systems where a discrete set of states @xmath18 can indeed be distinguished without disturbing the system .",
    "this shows that if an external clock tells us that the actual time @xmath5 is in the set @xmath19 we can read out our \" ` discrete clock without disturbing it .",
    "remarkably , the fact that readout without disturbance is in principle possible in the discrete case shows the advantage of controlling information processing by external clock signals : let now @xmath4 be the density matrix of any micro physical device . use the clock signal to switch on an interaction between the considered device and another system",
    ". then the sequence of states @xmath20 at the times @xmath21 can control the other system without back - action ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the relevance of the above observations for the reusability of clock signals has to be subject of further discussions .",
    "clearly the gate has extracted some information about the actual time from the clock signal when it is triggered .",
    "this results in a disturbance of the clock signal s quantum state .",
    "however , one may find systems where this extracted timing information flows back to the signal _",
    "after _ the implementation is performed .",
    "but as long as the triggered implementation is still running the gate has some timing information and the clock signal s state is still disturbed .",
    "in the last section we have shown that we can not extract timing information without disturbing the clock signal . however , we were not able to make quantitative statements about the tradeoff between information gain and disturbance . in the following situation ,",
    "we can find quantitative results : it is natural to ask whether it is possible to read out all the information about the actual time that is contained in the signal , i.e. , to copy it . in the following",
    "we will specify precisely what it means to ` copy the timing information ' .",
    "we use _ fisher timing information _ , a quantity that is actually well - known in a more general context of estimating parameterized quantum or classical statistical states @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is used in the specific context of investigating the quality of clocks , explicitly using the terminology ` fisher timing information ' .",
    "one might think of the fisher timing information @xmath22 of a system with statistical states @xmath4 as the quotient @xmath23 if @xmath24 is the error for the optimal estimation of @xmath5 that is achievable by measuring the state .",
    "the correct and formal definition of @xmath22 is given in the appendix .",
    "but the rough explanation of @xmath22 can be taken literally in many simple examples : assume @xmath4 to be pure quantum states with a gaussian energy distribution with standard deviation @xmath25 .",
    "then @xmath26 ( where we have measured the energy in the unit @xmath27 ) and one can easily construct measurements allowing an estimation of @xmath5 with standard deviation @xmath28 and no better estimation can exist due to heisenberg s uncertainty relation .",
    "another example where @xmath22 has a simple intuitive meaning is the following .",
    "consider a classical pulse , i.e. , a classical quantity @xmath29 that changes in time according to the function @xmath30 .",
    "this system has infinite timing information for any non - trivial function @xmath29 since the determination of @xmath31 allows to distinguish between @xmath5 and @xmath32 for arbitrarily small @xmath33 .",
    "if we introduce an unknown time delay of the signal with gaussian statistics the timing information of the ` smeared out ' signal is the standard deviation @xmath24 of the delay ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "one might think of @xmath31 as the classical current or voltage of any device or even the intensity of a ( classical ) light field .",
    "one can equivalently think of a classical signal moving with the velocity @xmath34 . if the exact position of the signal is unknown according to a gauss distribution with uncertainty @xmath35 the timing information is given by @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath4 is a finite dimensional density matrix of a quantum system evolving according to the hamiltonian @xmath7 , the quantity @xmath22 is less simple to calculate and is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 $ ] and @xmath39 is the pseudo - inverse of the super - operator @xmath40 with @xmath41 acting on the set of self - adjoint matrices @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we derived the following quantum bound for copying timing information :    assume a signal with fisher timing information @xmath22 enters a device ( an amplifier for example ) and triggers two outgoing signals with fisher information @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "then one has @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the total energy of the _ outgoing _ signals and @xmath46 is the expectation value of the square of this energy .",
    "accordingly , the time uncertainties @xmath47 and @xmath48 of the 2 outgoing signals triggered by an in - going signal with time uncertainty @xmath24 satisfy the following inequality : @xmath49 trying to give both signals the same timing information , i.e. , @xmath50 , one obtains @xmath51 we conclude that low energy signals loose part of their timing information when they are copied ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "in @xcite we have constructed an example showing that @xmath52 is indeed possible in the limit @xmath53 .",
    "note that this does _ not _ imply that a high amount of energy is _ dissipated _ when the signal is copied .",
    "the energy has only to be _ available_. whether the disturbance of the clock signal ( as explained in section [ disturb ] ) results necessarily in energy consumption , is unclear but if the signal looses some of its timing information it is unclear how to run a reversible process if the clock signal is included in the consideration .",
    "note that whenever the clock signal controls a device part of the signal s timing information is copied .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.4 .",
    "the proof of inequality ( [ ent ] ) can be found in @xcite and relies on a formal concept called _ quasi - order of clocks _ classifying physical systems ( quantum or classical ) with respect to their timing information . here",
    "timing information is not to be understood in the sense of a single quantity but refers to the statistical distinguishability of the quantum or classical states @xmath4 at different times @xmath5 .",
    "so to speak , it classifies the quality of clocks .",
    "this quality has many aspects : the physical system @xmath54 can be better than the system @xmath55 with respect to the distinguishability the states at the times @xmath56 and @xmath57 and nevertheless @xmath55 may be better than @xmath54 with respect to the distinguishability between the states at the times @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we write @xmath60 if @xmath54 is not worse than @xmath55 with respect to any criterion .",
    "the physical meaning is that is is possible in principle to realize a process with input @xmath54 and output @xmath55 such that the process has not to be controlled by an external clock .",
    "this idea can be formalized by describing the process by completely positive maps @xcite .",
    "the fact that no external clock is allowed to run the process corresponds to the condition that this map has to be covariant with respect to the time evolution of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath7 and @xmath61 are the hamiltonians of the input and output quantum system , a process @xmath62 is a completely positive trace - preserving map from the set of possible density matrices of the system @xmath54 to the set of density matrices of @xmath55 .",
    "it can be implemented without referring to external clocks if it satisfies the covariance condition @xmath63)=[\\tilde{h } , g(.)]\\,.\\ ] ] the condition states that the process is the same if it is implemented at a later time since it does not matter whether we let the _ input system _",
    "@xmath54 evolve for the time @xmath5 and apply then the process @xmath62 or we apply @xmath62 first and then wait for the time @xmath5 such that the _ output system _ @xmath55 is evolving in time .",
    "the output clock is not better than the input clock .",
    "as shown in @xcite this principle gives constraints to many physical processes .",
    "remarkably , the covariance condition also appeared in a rather different context in @xcite .",
    "there we found thermodynamic constraints on processes that can be run with a negligible amount of implementation energy .",
    "the considerations above refer to clocks showing the _ absolute _ time . at first sight",
    "one might think that the relevance of these results is restricted , since computation relies rather on the fact that gate implementations have to be synchronized and not that the gates are implemented at specific times .",
    "hence one will rather be interested in _ relative timing information _ than in _ absolute timing information _ discussed in the previous sections .",
    "however , as we have shown in @xcite , the problem of measuring the _ quality of synchronization _ of two signals can be reduced to the problem of measuring the localization in time of a single signal .",
    "we have introduced a formal concept called _ quasi - order of synchronism _ that is shown to be mathematically isomorphic to the quasi - order of clocks .",
    "the fact that our bound for copying timing information depends on the _ signal energy _ , might be astonishing .",
    "the tradeoff between information gain about a quantum state and the disturbance of the system does not refer a priori to the energy of the quantum system @xcite .",
    "nevertheless it is easy to get a rough idea why energy is a relevant quantity if the _ timing _ information of a system should be copied : an unknown quantum state @xmath64 can be perfectly copied ( ` broadcasted ' ) if and only if all the density matrices @xmath65 commute ( see @xcite for the proof and the definition of _ broadcasting _ quantum states ) .",
    "consider now the states @xmath4 of the hamiltonian time evolution .",
    "it is easy to see that all the states @xmath4 commute if and only if the time evolution is trivial , i.e. all states are the same .",
    "but it may be possible to find times @xmath21 such that all the states @xmath66 commute and we can copy the states perfectly if the prior information @xmath67 is given . for systems with high energy spread these times can be arbitrarily close together .",
    "an example is a pure quantum state given by the equal superposition @xmath68 where @xmath13 is an energy eigenstate with energy @xmath69 .",
    "then the states at the times @xmath70 are mutually orthogonal for different @xmath13 , i.e. , they can be copied without disturbance .",
    "the average energy of the system is @xmath71 , i.e. , the distinguishable states get closer and closer together ( compare @xcite ) for @xmath72 .",
    "even if no prior information about @xmath5 is given , one can imagine that it is possible to extract some information about @xmath5 while disturbing the state only a little bit as long as one wants to know @xmath5 only up to an error that is much larger than @xmath73 .",
    "one can sketch the idea of these remarks by claiming that the timing information in systems with low energy is essentially quantum information and timing information in systems with high energy spread can have a high part of classical information that can be extracted without disturbing the system too much .",
    "the result has an interesting implication for low power computation : consider a fanout in low power circuits .",
    "then the two out - going signals can not have the same localization in time as the in - going signal .",
    "these results suggest the following problem of extremely low power computation : if one uses low power clock signals it is difficult to copy the signal and distribute it to many devices .",
    "if the signals contain more energy the question of the reusability becomes more relevant .",
    "we have shown that every clock signal , as far as it is given by a finite dimensional quantum system is necessarily disturbed when it controls a device .",
    "quantitative results concerning the tradeoff between the effect of the clock on the network and the back - action are the subject of further research .",
    "a first step towards such a quantitative analysis shows that strong disturbance of the signal is inevitable if most of the signal s timing information is transfered to the triggered system .",
    "our bounds on the disturbance become relevant if the signal energy is in the order of @xmath74 where @xmath24 is the signal s accuracy in time . to",
    "what extent this result implies bounds on energy dissipation for all computation processes with a global clocking mechanism is unclear .",
    "it is not even clear how to define such a mechanism formally .",
    "however , it indicates serious difficulties that may appear if the usual concept of clocking is maintained in future low power technology .",
    "thanks to michael frank for an interesting email discussion . his statements encouraged us to figure out the relevance of former results for the reusability of clock signals .",
    "this work has been supported by dfg - grants of the ` schwerpunktprogramm verlustarme informationsverarbeitung ' .",
