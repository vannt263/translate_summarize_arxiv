    "the scaling relation between black hole mass and host - galaxy properties , e.g. , the black hole mass@xmath5stellar velocity dispersion relation ( @xmath0 ) , suggests a coevolution of black holes and galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , motivating various theoretical and observational studies to constrain the origin of the scaling relations and their cosmic evolution @xcite . along with inactive galaxies , galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei ( agn ) also seem to follow the @xmath0  relation with a similar slope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that the present - day galaxies show a similar scaling relation regardless of black hole activity .",
    "in contrast , it has been debated whether present - day narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) deviate from the @xmath0  relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . as a sub - class of agns , nls1s were initially identified by the relatively small width of the broad - component of the balmer lines ( fwhm @xmath2 2000 km  s@xmath6 ) and a weak [ o iii]-to - h@xmath4  ratio ( [ o iii]/h@xmath4  @xmath2 3 ; osterbrock & pogge 1985 ) . since nls1s are believed to have small black hole masses and high eddington ratios ( boroson 2002 ) , nls1s are often considered as relatively young agns hosting black holes in a growing phase although the time evolution among various types of agns is highly uncertain .",
    "thus , it is interesting to investigate the location of nls1s in the @xmath0  plane in the context of black hole - galaxy coevolution .",
    "a number of studies have been devoted to studying the @xmath0  relation of nls1s over the last decade , resulting in a controversy . on the one hand",
    ", some studies claimed that nls1 lie below the @xmath0  relation on average with smaller black hole masses at fixed stellar velocity dispersions , compared to the broad - line agns and quiescent galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . on the other hand , other studies",
    "reported that the nls1s are generally on the @xmath0  relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fundamental limitation of the aforementioned studies is the fact that stellar velocity dispersions were not directly measured . instead",
    ", the width of the narrow [ o iii ]  emission line at 5007  was used as a surrogate for stellar velocity dispersion , based on the empirical correlation between [ o iii ]  width and stellar velocity dispersion @xcite , although there is a considerably large scatter between them .",
    "if the ionized gas in the narrow - line region follows the gravitational potential of the host - galaxy , then [ o iii ]  line width can be substituted for stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "however for individual objects the uncertainty of this substitution is very large as shown by the direct comparison between [ o iii ]  width and the measured stellar velocity dispersion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the [ o iii ]  line often suffers from the effect of outflow , manifesting an asymmetric line profile and a strong blue - shifted wing component ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", the width of the [ o iii ]  line will become much broader than stellar velocity dispersion , if the blue wing is not properly corrected for .",
    "in fact , @xcite showed that when the blue wing component is removed in measuring the width of the [ o iii ]  line , the inferred stellar velocity dispersion from [ o iii ]   becomes smaller , hence the nls1 show a consistent @xmath0  relation compared to broad - line agns .",
    "the solution to this decade - long debate is to investigate the locus of nls1s in the @xmath0  plane , using _ directly measured _ stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "although , measuring stellar velocity dispersion of agn host galaxies is difficult due to the presence of strong agn features , i.e. , power - law continuum , fe ii  emission , and broad emission lines , it is possible to measure stellar velocity dispersion if high quality spectra are available as demonstrated in a number of studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", we present the direct stellar velocity dispersion measurements and estimates of black hole masses for a sample of 93 nls1s at z @xmath7 selected from sloan digital sky survey data release 7 ( sdss dr7 ) @xcite , in order to investigate the @xmath0  relation of nls1s .",
    "we describe the sample selection and properties in section 2 , and the analysis including mass determination and stellar velocity dispersion measurements in section 3 .",
    "section 4 presents the results , followed by discussion in section 5 , and summary and conclusions in section 6 . throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt a cosmology of @xmath8 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "nls1s are generally defined with two criteria : ( 1 ) the full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of broad component of the balmer lines @xmath2 2000 km  s@xmath6 , and ( 2 ) the line flux ratio [ o iii]/h@xmath4  @xmath2 3 @xcite .",
    "additional characteristics of nls1s include strong fe ii  emission @xcite , high eddington ratio and soft x@xmath5ray emission @xcite . in this study , we selected a sample of nls1s from sdss dr7 @xcite , based on the width of balmer lines and the [ o iii]/h@xmath4  flux ratios . first , we selected nls1 candidates by limiting the width of h@xmath4 to 500@xmath52500 km s@xmath9 , using the specline class in the sdss query tool ( http://casjobs.sdss.org ) .",
    "since the line width measurements from the sdss pipeline is not precise , we used a wider width range than the conventional definition for the initial selection , obtaining 4,252 nls1 candidates at z @xmath2 0.1 .",
    "second , using this initial sample , we performed a multi - component spectral decomposition analysis for each galaxy , to properly measure the width of the broad component of the balmer lines . in the fitting process , we included multiple components , namely , featureless agn continuum , stellar population model , and fe ii  emission component , using an idl - based spectral decomposition code ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . by subtracting the linear combination of featureless agn continuum , stellar component and fe ii  emission , we obtained emission line spectra and fit the broad and narrow emission lines ( see section 3.1 for the detailed fitting process ) .",
    "based on the measurements from the fitting process , we finalized a sample of 464 nls1s , that satisfy the aforementioned two criteria by limiting the fwhm of broad h@xmath12   between 800 and 2200 km  s@xmath6  and the line flux ration [ o iii]/h@xmath4  less than 3 .    among these objects , we measured and collected the stellar velocity dispersion for 93 nls1s . for 63 objects , we were able to directly measure stellar velocity dispersion using the sdss spectra ( see section 3.5 ) while for 30 objects we obtained the stellar velocity dispersion measurements from @xcite .",
    "thus , using this sample of 93 nls1s , we investigate the properties of nls1 and the @xmath0  relation .",
    "note that the distribution of nls1 properties ( i.e. , [ o iii]/h@xmath4  ratio , fe ii / h@xmath4  ratio , h@xmath12  luminosity and width ) of the final sample of 93 objects is similar to that of the initial sample of 464 objects , suggesting that we may treat the final sample as a random subsample of nls1 galaxy population .",

    "since the h@xmath4  is relatively weak and the decomposition of the broad and narrow components of h@xmath4   is uncertain , we used the total h@xmath4  flux to compare with [ o iii ]  and fe ii  fluxes .    in the case of the [ o iii ]",

    "* ) , is also high with a mean 1.06 , as similarly found by other nls1 studies ( for dependence on the r4570 index , see  4.1 ) .",
    "for example , @xcite used the broad component of h@xmath4  to compare with fe ii  and reported the mean r4570 as @xmath130.82 , while @xcite adopted the total flux of h@xmath4  and found the mean r4570 @xmath130.7 .",

    "@xmath165007 was carried out for this region . since [ o iii ]",
    "@xmath165007 shows often complex profile such as velocity shift of [ o iii ]  core and asymmetry @xcite , we decomposed the [ o iii ]  line into a narrow core and a broad base .",
    "if [ o iii ]  has the broad base which tends to show blue - asymmetric ( blue wing ) , the [ o iii ]  is fitted with double gaussian components . on the other hand ,",
    "if the [ o iii ]  profile is symmetric or of the s / n is low , the [ o iii ]  is fitted with a single gaussian component .",
    "then , the best - fit model of the [ o iii ]  @xmath165007 line was used to model [ o iii ]  @xmath164959 and h@xmath4  narrow component by assuming that these narrow lines have the same widths .",
    "the flux ratio of the [ o iii ]  @xmath164959 to the [ o iii ]  @xmath165007 was assumed to be 1:3 , while the height of the h@xmath4  narrow component was set as free parameter .",
    "next , we fitted the h@xmath4  broad component with a single gaussian component since the s / n of h@xmath4  is typically lower than [ o iii ] .    for the h@xmath12  region , we did not subtract fe ii  emission because fe ii  is relatively weak in this spectral range .",
    "first , we fit the host - galaxy continuum using two spectral regions 6400@xmath56460  and 6740@xmath56800  for determining the best model , where no other emissions are present . after subtracting the stellar features , we fitted [ s ii ]  @xmath166716 and [ s ii ]  @xmath166731 , respectively with a single gaussian component .",
    "we assumed that the widths of [ s ii ] , [ n ii ] , and the h@xmath12  narrow component are the same , and used the width of the [ s ii ]  for fitting [ n ii ]  and the narrow h@xmath12 , if the spectral quality is high ( s / n of [ s ii ]  @xmath17 ) . for low s",
    "/ n targets , the width of [ s ii ]  is not reliable and we fitted the h@xmath12  narrow component and the [ n ii ]  doublet with a single gaussian model , without using the best - fit of the [ s ii ]  line . the flux ratio between [ n",

    "for the h@xmath12  broad component , gauss - hermitian series were used to model the h@xmath12  profile as done by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : fitting ] presents an example of the multicomponent fitting .",
    "we estimated the uncertainty of the h@xmath12  luminosity based on the s / n of the line flux . in the case of the line widths",
    ", we performed monte carlo simulations by randomizing the flux per pixel using the flux noise . for a set of 100 simulated spectra , we repeated spectral decomposition , measured the line width , and adopted the 1-sigma dispersion of the distribution as the uncertainty of the line widths for each object .",
    "the estimated uncertainties are included in table 1 .",
    "black hole mass can be determined based on the virial theorem : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the velocity of the broad - line region ( blr ) gas , @xmath20 is the blr size , and g is the gravitational constant @xcite .",
    "generally , either the second moment ( line dispersion ; @xmath21 ) or the fwhm of the h@xmath4  line ( @xmath22 ) is used for the velocity of the blr gas .",
    "along with each velocity measurements , a virial factor f is needed for mass determination .",
    "the determination of the average virial factor , respectively , for @xmath21  and @xmath22can be found in appendix , where we derived the virial factor by comparing the reverberation - mapped agns and quiescent galaxies in the @xmath0  plane .    instead of directly measuring the size of blr by reverberation mapping , which requires a long - term spectroscopic monitoring , an empirical size - luminosity relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we used the size@xmath5luminosity relation from @xcite , and derive the @xmath1  estimator as follows , @xmath23    for our nls1s , the width of the h@xmath12  line is better determined that that of the h@xmath4  lines since h@xmath4  often have much lower s / n .",
    "thus , we used the measurement of h@xmath12  line width and luminosity for @xmath1  estimation , using the following two relations @xcite : @xmath24 @xmath25 assuming the h@xmath4  and h@xmath12  have the same line profile ( i.e. , fwhm = 2 @xmath26 ) , we also converted @xmath27  to @xmath21  using eq .",
    "3 . to test the validity of eq . 3 for our nls1 , we compared the line width of h@xmath4  and h@xmath12  using a subsample of 41 nls1s , for which the s / n ratio of h@xmath4is larger than 20 so that we could obtain reliable emission line fitting results .",
    "we find that the relation between h@xmath12  and h@xmath4  of nls1s is consistent with that of reported by @xcite , with a slight offset @xmath28 from the equation ( 3 ) . for comparing @xmath29  with h@xmath12  luminosity , we used all nls1s in our sample , for which @xmath29  was measured from a power - law component in the multi - component fitting process . as shown in figure 3 , the relation between @xmath29  and h@xmath12  luminosity is close to equation ( 4 ) , with a slight offset @xmath30 .",
    "this result suggests that using the conversion equation is acceptable for nls1s and that the multi - component fitting results are reasonable , although a proper comparison is difficult due to the limited dynamical range of the nls1 sample compared to that of @xcite .",
    "note that we used a gauss - hermite series for the broad h@xmath12  component , and a single gaussian model for the broad h@xmath4  component ( due to low s / n ratio ) , while @xcite used a multicomponent gaussian models for both h@xmath12  and h@xmath4 .",

    "is a key to determine the location of nls1 on the @xmath0  plane . to investigate the systematic uncertainties of the stellar velocity dispersion measurements , we measured @xmath34  in three spectral regions : ( 1 ) mg @xmath35-fe region ( 5000 - 5430 ) , which includes strong absorption lines , i.e. , mg @xmath35  triplet ( 5069 , 5154 , 5160 ) and fe ( 5270 , 5335 ) lines ( hereafter @xmath36 ) ; ( 2 ) mg @xmath35-fe region ( 5000 - 5430 ) excluding the mg @xmath35  triplet ( hereafter @xmath37 ) ; and ( 3 ) ca ii  region ( 8400 - 8800 ) , where the ca ii  triplet ( 8498 , 8542 , 8662 ) is a strong feature ( hereafter @xmath38 ) .",
    "the line strength of the mg @xmath35  triplet is much higher in the composite spectra of massive elliptical galaxies than in the nearby stars , hence , the template mismatch due to the @xmath39element enhancement can potentially cause a systematic bias in measuring @xmath34 , although this effect is not significant for late - type host galaxies @xcite . in the case of the ca ii  triplet region , agn contamination ( e.g. , fe ii  emission )",
    "is relatively weaker than the mg @xmath35  region , while the residual of sky emission lines is often present and the quality of spectra is generally lower than that of the mg @xmath35  region .",
    "thus , as a consistency check , we measured stellar velocity dispersion using three different spectral regions ( see similar investigation by greene et al .",
    "we find that three measurements are consistent , showing that the effect of the mg abundance is negligible ( see below ) .",
    "we corrected for the sdss spectral resolution by subtracting the instrumental resolution from the measured stellar velocity dispersion in quadrature .",
    "instead of using a mean constant resolution @xmath13 70 km  s@xmath6 , which is often adopted in the literature , we calculated the mean instrumental resolution in the corresponding fitting ranges for each object , using the spectral resolution fits file provided by sdss dr7 .",
    "for example , we used the spectral range 5000 - 5430   to calculate the mean instrumental resolution for the mg @xmath35-fe region , which is @xmath1355 - 56 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "compared to the instrumental resolution , the stellar lines of the objects that we mesured stellar velocity dispersions are well resolved .    after masking out agn narrow emission lines ( e.g. , [ fe vii ]  @xmath165160 , [ n i ]  @xmath165201 , [ ca v ]  @xmath165310 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we measured @xmath34  by using both the penalized pixel - fitting ( ppxf ) method @xcite and a python - based code based on the algorithm by @xcite .",
    "we used stellar velocity templates from indo@xmath5us stellar library , which includes various spectral type giant stars with a range of metallicity ( [ fe / h ] = -0.49 @xmath5 0.18 ) @xcite .",
    "low order polynomials were used to fit the broad curvature in the spectra after masking out the narrow emission lines and bad spectral regions . after intense tests with various polynomial orders and templates for each target",
    ", we adopted the mean of the measurements based on each polynomial order and each spectral range with a different mask - out region , as a final measurement of @xmath34 .    in this process , we measured @xmath36  for 62 nls1s , that show strong enough stellar lines . among them , we were able to measure @xmath38  for 34 nls1s , while we could not measure the @xmath34  from the ca ii  triplet for the other objects , since the sdss spectral range does not cover the rest - frame ca ii  triplet region for targets at z @xmath40 , or the strength of the ca ii  triplet is too weak to measure @xmath34  ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "as a consistency check , we compared the @xmath36  with @xmath37  and @xmath38 in figure  [ fig : svd ] .",
    "the @xmath36  is slightly higher by a few percent ( 0.015 dex ) than the @xmath37 , and the rms scatter is 0.06 dex .",
    "this result confirms the @xmath36  is consistent with the @xmath37  and indicates the influence of the mg @xmath35  triplet is marginal in measuring the @xmath34  of the host galaxies of nls1s .",
    "the comparison between @xmath38  and @xmath36  shows slightly larger scatter ( 0.10 dex ) , but the average offset is still close to zero ( i.e. , 0.014 dex ) , suggesting that the @xmath36  is consistent with the @xmath38 . based on these results without strong bias among the measurements from various spectral regions , we adopted @xmath36  as the final measurements . as a consistency check",
    ", we compared our measurements with sdss dr7 values .",
    "we found stellar velocity dispersion measurements for 5 objects from sdss dr7 , which are consistent with our measurements within the measurement uncertainties .    among 93 nls1s ,",
    "30 nls1s were studied previously by @xcite , who measured @xmath34  based on high quality spectra with higher spectral resolution obtained with the keck echellette spectrograph and imager ( esi ) and the magellan echellette ( mage ) .",
    "thus , including the @xmath34  measurements of 30 nls1s from @xcite , we have a total of 93 measurements of the @xmath34 .",
    "we note that the 3  sdss fiber size is larger than the slit size adopted by @xcite .",
    "thus , the sdss spectra represent a larger physical scale of the host galaxies than the keck spectra of @xcite , and may show larger influence of rotational broadening .",
    "however , it is difficult to perform a direct comparison between sdss - based and keck - based measurements due to the fact that most of 30 nls1s studied by @xcite have smaller velocity dispersion than the sdss instrumental resolution .",
    "we found only one object among 30 nls1s , for which both sdss - based and keck - based stellar velocity dispersion measurements are available and show consistency ( @xmath41 vs. @xmath42 km  s@xmath6 ) .      for galaxies with a rotating stellar disk , the line - of - sight stellar velocity dispersion can be overestimated due to rotational broadening @xcite , therefore it is important to correct for the rotation effect in measuring @xmath34 .",
    "since the rotating disk is common among late - type galaxies and the ratio between rotation velocity and velocity dispersion is typically higher in late - type galaxies than in early - type galaxies , the effect of the rotational broadening is expected to be stronger for late type galaxies , particularly for more inclined galaxies toward the line - of - sight .    to investigate the rotation effect on the @xmath0  relation , we classified our nls1s into early and late type galaxies , using the sdss colors and the presence of a disk . for late - type galaxies",
    ", we further divided them into two groups : more face - on and more edge - on galaxies based on the inclination of the disk .",
    "the inclination angle is determined from the minor - to - major axial ratio of the disk as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the inclination angle of the galactic disk to the line of sight ( i.e. , @xmath45 for an edge - on disk ) and @xmath46 is the ratio of the minor to major axes of the disk .",
    "we classified our sample with @xmath47 ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) as face - on galaxies , and the others with @xmath49 ( i.e. , @xmath50 ) were classified as edge - on galaxies .",
    "as a result , 93 nls1 galaxies were divided into 35 early type galaxies and 58 late type galaxies which were further divided into 48 face - on and 10 edge - on late types .",

    "the best - fit @xmath0  relation of the rm agns suffers from the effect of the limited mass distribution compared to the quiescent galaxy sample .",
    "the truncation of the mass distribution of the rm agns caused a shallower slope of the @xmath0  relation as discussed in detail by woo et al .",
    "2013 . in turn , the offset of the nls1s with respect to this shallow @xmath0  slope becomes slightly negative since the nls1s are mainly located at the low @xmath1  and low stellar velocity dispersion region .",
    "considering the small offset and the limited mass distribution , nls1s seem to show a consistent @xmath0  relation compared to the rm agns .    among nls1s , there is a large scatter with a clear trend with the host galaxy morphology .",
    "compared to the best - fit @xmath0  relation of the joint sample of quiescent galaxies and rm agns , early - type nls1s show a positive offset ( @xmath52 @xmath1@xmath59 and @xmath52 @xmath1@xmath60 , respectively in the left and right panels ) while late - type galaxies present a negative offset ( @xmath52 @xmath1@xmath61 and @xmath52 @xmath1@xmath62 , respectively in the left and right panels in figure 4 ) .",
    "the large difference of the offset between early - type and late - type nls1 galaxies may stem from the effect of the rotational broadening in the stellar absorption lines since single aperture spectra have been used for measuring the stellar velocity dispersion . to test this scenario ,",
    "we further divide the late - type nls1 galaxies into two groups , i.e , edge - on and face - on galaxies ( see section 3.4 for morphology classification ) , and calculated the mean offset .",
    "clearly , the edge - on late type galaxies , which are expected to have larger rotational broadening in the line - of - sight stellar velocity dispersion measurements , show the largest negative offset ( @xmath52 @xmath1@xmath63 and @xmath52 @xmath1@xmath64 , respectively in the left and right panels in figure 4 ) , while the face - on galaxies do not show a clear offset ( @xmath52 @xmath1@xmath65 and @xmath52 @xmath1@xmath66 , respectively in the left and right panels in figure 4 ) .",
    "thus , we suspect that the large scatter of the nls1s in the @xmath0  plane and the systematic trend of the offset with galaxy morphology and inclination are due to the rotational broadening @xcite .      in this section , we investigate whether the offset from the @xmath0  relation is correlated with other agn parameters , i.e. , eddington ratio , r5007 and r4570 .",
    "note that the offset is calculated with respect to the best - fit @xmath0  relation of the joint sample of quiescent galaxies and rm agns .",
    "first , we compare the offset with eddington ratio in figure  [ fig : offset ] ( left ) , finding no significant correlation between the offset and @xmath67  ( see consistent results by * ? ? ? * ) . for this comparison ,",
    "eddington ratio was determined by dividing the bolometric luminosity by the eddington luminosity , l@xmath68 , using the continuum luminosity at 5100  as a proxy ( @xmath69 = 9@xmath16@xmath29 ) @xcite .",
    "we also used the h@xmath12 line luminosity instead of the continuum luminosity at 5100based on equation 4 , and obtained the same results .",
    "second , we present the comparison between the offset and r5007 in figure  [ fig : offset ] . r5007 does not significantly correlate with the offset of nls1s in general and in all three different morphology groups .    in figure",
    "[ fig : offset_r4570 ] , we compare the fe ii  strength ( r4570 ) with the offset from the @xmath0  relation . there is a weak correlation between them : while the weak fe ii  emitters show both positive and negative offsets , the strong fe ii  emitters mainly show negative offset .",
    "this result implies that nls1s with strong fe ii   more significantly deviate from the @xmath0  relation .",
    "the correlation is slightly different for different morphology groups .",
    "however , the sample size in each morphology group is too small to definitely claim any difference .",
    "in addition , we tested whether the offset from the @xmath0  relation is related with the agn fraction ( see figure  [ fig : offset_r4570 ] right panels ) , using the agn fraction determined from the monochromatic flux ratio of agn to host galaxy at 5100 .",
    "we find a good correlation of the offset with the agn fraction : the offset positively increases with increasing agn fraction .",
    "this correlation is also present in each morphology group while early - type galaxies have on average higher agn fraction than late type galaxies .",
    "the interpretation of this correlation is not straightforward since a strong selection effect is involved in measuring stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "for example , if the agn fraction is higher , then it is more difficult to measure stellar velocity dispersion",
    ". hence , only massive early - type galaxies are available at high agn fraction regime , while most late - type galaxies hosting high luminosity agns are missing from the distribution .",
    "the contribution of the rotation of stellar disks can bias stellar velocity dispersion measurements due to the rotational broadening of the stellar absorption lines .",
    "for example , if a single - aperture spectrum , which is integrated over a large portion of a stellar disk , is used for measuring the second moment of the absorption lines , the rotational effect can significantly increase the velocity dispersion measurements .",
    "for early - type galaxies the rotation effect is relatively small since the velocity dispersion is typically higher than rotation velocity .",
    "for example , @xcite reported that the stellar velocity dispersion changes by @xmath1310% as a function of the aperture size , based on the spatially resolved measurements of 31 early - type galaxies in the @xmath0  sample .",
    "in contrast , we expect the rotation effect can be substantially larger in late - type galaxies than in early - type galaxies due to much higher velocity - to - dispersion ( v/@xmath26 ) ratios . for disk - dominant late - type galaxies , the inclination to the line - of - sight can also play a significant role due to the project effect .",
    "based on the n - body smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations , @xcite reported that bulge stellar velocity dispersion measurements can change by 30% depending on the galaxy inclination .",
    "since most of the @xmath34  measurements for agn host galaxies are based single - aperture spectra , the effect of rotation and inclination can play a role in comparing bl agns with nls1s . using a sample of low @xmath1  agn sample",
    ", @xcite showed a clear dependency of galaxy inclination on the offset from the @xmath0  relation , i.e. , more inclined galaxies tend to have higher @xmath34  and negatively offset , while more face - on galaxies tend to have lower @xmath34  and positively offset .",
    "the observed trend of the offset from the @xmath0  relation with galaxy inclination in our study is similar to @xcite , reflecting the same effect of the rotation and inclination of late - type galaxies .",
    "thus , the conclusion that nls1s follow the same @xmath0  relation as bl agns is still limited by the lack of spatially resolved measurements . to better understand the effect of rotation and inclination , spatially resolved measurements are required for nls1s , which is beyond the scope of the current study .",
    "two different scenarios have been suggested for the evolution of nls1s . on the one hand ,",
    "nls1s are considered as the precursors of bl agns , evolving into bl agns .",
    "the low @xmath1  and the high eddington ratio of nls1s may imply that nls1s are young phase of agns @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "nls1s are viewed as an extension of bl agns at the low - mass scale @xcite .",
    "if the high eddington ratio of nls1s represents a relatively short - lived accretion phase , and the eddington ratio before and after the strong accretion phase is relatively low , then the black hole growth in nls1 may be insignificant .",
    "we find no significant evidence that nls1 offset from the @xmath0  relation of active and inactive galaxies , suggesting that nls1s and bl agns are similar in terms of the current black hole growth . in the case of the host galaxies of nls1s , there seems no strong difference between the environments of nls1s and bl agns @xcite .",
    "also , nls1s are not preferentially hosted by merging galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , the growth of black holes and host galaxies seem to be similar between nls1 and bl agns .    based on the estimates of the bolometric luminosity of the nls1s in our sample , we calculated the mass accretion rate in order to investigate the black hole growth time scale . for given the range of bolometric luminosity of 10@xmath70 - 10@xmath71 erg  s@xmath6",
    ", we estimate the mass accretion rate as @xmath130.002 - @xmath130.02 @xmath14  year@xmath9 . thus , in order to accrete a million solar mass to a black hole with a constant mass accretion rate of @xmath130.002 - @xmath130.02 @xmath14  year@xmath9 , it would take 10@xmath72 - 10@xmath73 yrs .",
    "the mean eddington ratio of the nls1s in our sample is @xmath1310% , for which the e - folding growth time scale is 4@xmath74@xmath75 yrs .",
    "thus , unless the life time of the agn activity is comparable to this growth time scale , nls1s are not expected to move up to the larger @xmath1  direction in the @xmath0  plane .",
    "nls1s are often considered as more inclined ( pole - on ) systems to the line - of - sight than bl agns , implying that the measured line - of - sight velocity dispersion ( line width ) of broad emission lines is relatively narrow due to the projection effect .",
    "if this is the case , then the @xmath1  of nls1s are significantly underestimated and their eddington ratios are accordingly overestimated . however , although there are some evidences that nls1s are close to pole - on systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the inclination effect can not explain the entire nls1 population ( see discussion by peterson 2011 ) .",
    "the implication of the potential inclination effect is that the nls1s in our sample would positively offset toward the high @xmath1  direction , if the black hole masses were were estimated after correcting for the velocity projection effect . in this scenario",
    ", it is difficult to understand why nls1s have higher black hole to galaxy mass ratios compared to bl agns and quiescent galaxies .",
    "we note that 6 nls1s are included in the sample of the reverberation - mapped agns , which are used for deriving the average virial factor for type 1 agns ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "the location of the nls1s in the @xmath0  plane is not different from that of bl agns , implying that the virial factor and inclination angle of the nls1s may not be very different from those of bl agns , although the number of nls1s in the reverberation - mapped agn sample is still small to make a firm conclusion .",
    "we investigated the @xmath0  relation of the present - day nls1 , using directly measured stellar velocity dispersions for a sample of 93 nls1s at z@xmath20.1 selected from the sdss .",

    "<S> however , there is a clear trend of the offset with the host galaxy morphology , i.e. , more inclined galaxies toward the line - of - sight have higher stellar velocity dispersion , suggesting that the rotational broadening plays a role in measuring stellar velocity dispersion based on the single - aperture spectra from the sloan digital sky survey . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we provide the virial factor @xmath3 ( f = 1.12 ) , for @xmath1  estimators based on the fwhm of h@xmath4 , by jointly fitting the @xmath0  relation using quiescent galaxies and reverberation - mapped agns . </S>"
