    "such expressions have been largely tested in the large @xmath10 processes and are normally used to relate data obtained at different @xmath10 using the appropriate number of `` active '' flavors @xmath13 and different values of @xmath14 in the ranges between the various quark thresholds .    both expressions become singular and completely inadequate as @xmath15 approaches @xmath16 .",
    "therefore they must be somewhat modified in the infrared region .",
    "various proposals have been done in this direction .",
    "the most naive assumption consists in cutting the curve ( [ runcst ] ) at a certain maximum value @xmath17 to be treated as a mere phenomenological parameter ( truncation prescription ) .",
    "alternatively , on the basis of general analyticity arguments , shirkov and solovtsov @xcite replace ( [ runcst ] ) with @xmath18 this remains regular for @xmath19 and has a finite @xmath14 independent limit @xmath20 , for @xmath21 .",
    "finally , inspired also by phenomenological reasons , dokshitzer @xmath5 @xcite write @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the perturbative running coupling constant as given by eq .",
    "( [ runcst ] ) and @xmath24 is a derivative acting on @xmath23 .",
    "the various curves are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the above modified expressions have been applied to study various effects in which infrared behavior turns out to be important .",
    "electron - positron annihilation into hadrons , @xmath25-lepton decay , lepton - hadron deep inelastic scattering , jet shapes , pion form - factors etc .",
    "are of this type .    in the quark - antiquark bound state problem",
    "the variable @xmath15 can be identified with the squared momentum transfer @xmath26 and formally the use of a running coupling constant amounts to include higher order terms in the perturbative part of the potential or the bethe - salpeter kernel . in this case",
    "all values of @xmath27 are involved and an infrared regularization becomes essential .",
    "furthermore @xmath28 ranges typically between @xmath29 and @xmath30 for different quark masses and internal excitations and values of @xmath27 smaller than @xmath16 can be important . the specific infrared behavior is therefore expected to affect the spectrum and other properties of mesons .    the purpose of this paper is to test such kind of effects in a particular formalism we have developed and used in previous papers .",
    "in reference @xcite we have obtained a good reproduction of the entire meson spectrum in terms of only four adjustable parameters , by solving numerically the eigenvalue equation for the squared mass operator @xmath31 or the mass operator @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the kinetic term and u and v are complicated momentum dependent potentials . up to the first order in the running coupling constant @xmath34 and in terms of the string tension @xmath35 , the `` quadratic potential '' u",

    "an expression for @xmath44 can be obtained by a direct comparison of eq .",
    "( [ eqm1 ] ) with eq .",

    "properly one should divide @xmath46 by @xmath47 , practically the simpler replacement @xmath48 is essentially equivalent .",

    "actually in @xcite we have neglected the complicated fine structure spin dependent terms occurring in ( [ eq : upot ] ) and taken into account only the hyperfine term in @xmath53 .",

    "the quantities @xmath14 and @xmath62 were fixed @xmath6 from high energy data ; @xmath63 , @xmath35 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 were adjusted on the ground @xmath66 and @xmath67 states , the @xmath66 hyperfine splitting and the regge trajectory slope .    in this paper , to test the sensitivity of the results to the infrared behavior of @xmath34",
    ", we have performed the same calculation in the @xmath67 , @xmath66 and @xmath68 ( @xmath69 or _ d _ ) case using eqs .",
    "( [ runshk ] ) and ( [ runlcnt ] ) , with an appropriate redefinition of the adjustable parameters .",
    "in tables [ tablbb ] , [ tablcc ] , and [ tabluu ] we give the @xmath67 , @xmath66 , and @xmath68 quarkonium masses respectively obtained for the different running coupling constant prescriptions . in column ( a )",
    "we report the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for the truncated @xmath34 , in column ( b ) those obtained by means of eq .",
    "( [ runshk ] ) proposed by shirkov - solovtsov and in column ( c ) those obtained by means of the @xmath34 of eq .",
    "( [ runlcnt ] ) proposed by dokshitzer @xmath5    in columns ( b ) and ( c ) we used the same values @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath7 as in @xcite , but we have slightly redefined the adjustable parameters taking @xmath70 in both cases and @xmath71 and @xmath72 for prescription ( [ runshk ] ) ( column ( b ) ) , @xmath73 and @xmath74 for prescription ( [ runlcnt ] ) ( column ( c ) ) .",
    "notice that , in spite of the reduced number of adjustable parameters , the spectra of bottonium and charmonium are not essentially modified by the new choice for @xmath34 , with perhaps the exceptions of the highest @xmath66 states that are lower in the dokshitzer @xmath5 case .",
    "this indicate little sensitivity of such spectra to the infrared behavior of @xmath34 .",
    "the situation is completely different for the light - light spectrum of table [ tabluu ] . while in front of the experimental and theoretical uncertainties columns (",
    "a ) and ( c ) can be considered not really distinguishable , the values reported in column ( b ) are definitely systematically too low ( in particular @xmath75 for @xmath76-meson ) .",
    "notice however that in the above reported calculations we have used for @xmath77 and @xmath78 the current mass value of @xmath79 .",
    "this amounts to assume the difference between the current and the constituent masses to be essentially related to kinematical relativistic correction ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) or , what is the same , that the free quark propagator is a good approximation for the complete one in the b - s equation . the inability of the formalism to reproduce a reasonable value for the @xmath76 mass and all experience gained by the chiral symmetry problematic ( see in particular @xcite and reference herein ) suggests that this should not be the case for the light - light systems .    for this reason we have repeated the calculation for choice ( [ runshk ] ) with various constituent values for the light quark masses .",
    "two sets of results are reported in columns ( d ) and ( e ) of table [ shrkuu ] .",
    "notice that for @xmath80 the situation is again very similar to those of column ( a ) , table [ tabluu ] .",
    "notice also however that as @xmath81 increases the bound state masses uniformly increase and that for low value of @xmath81 the lowest bound state masses can be made to agree fairly well with the data , for high value the same occurs for higher states .",
    "this could suggest the use of a kind of running constituent mass .    in column ( h ) the results",
    "are reported for the squared effective mass @xmath82 @xmath83 denoting the quark momentum in the center of mass frame . in eq .",
    "( [ massrun1 ] ) the coefficients are chosen in order to obtain @xmath84 for @xmath85 approximately corresponding to the @xmath86 values for the 1s , 2d and 1 g states respectively . as it can be seen the agreement with the data",
    "is much improved in this way and finally even a reasonable value for the @xmath76 mass is obtained .",
    "notice that the use of an effective running mass is in agreement with the general perspectives of combining dyson - schwinger equation with b - s equation .",
    "obviously a fine tuning of the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ massrun1 ] ) to further improve the results would be meaningless in the present context , due even to the approximation used ( _ e.g. _ the triplet - singlet splitting has been essentially evaluated perturbalively ) .",
    "in conclusion the heavy quarkonium spectrum does not seem to be very sensitive to the specific infrared behavior of the running constant as it could be expected on general ground .    for the light quarkonium dokshitzer @xmath5 prescription ( [ runlcnt ] ) does not essentially change the results in comparison with the truncation assumption adopted in @xcite , in spite of the very different appearance of the corresponding curve in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]      actually such prescription would be definitely ruled out if we insisted in using a current mass for the light quarks .",
    "if however we give to @xmath81 a constituent value the results are again similar to those obtained with the truncated @xmath34 and can be strongly improved if we use the running effective mass ( [ massrun1 ] ) .    to understand better the meaning of eq .",
    "( [ massrun1 ] ) , notice that , in the context of the second order formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the free quark propagator @xmath87 occurring in the bs equation is @xmath88 , where we have to set @xmath89 ( the upper and lower signs referring to the quark and the antiquark respectively ) in the c.m . frame . however if , consistently with the other approximations made , we neglect the spin dependent terms , the full quark propagator @xmath90 can be written as @xmath91 . then , recalling that the instantaneous approximation consists in setting @xmath92 in the bs kernel , in the same order of ideas we can replace the slowly varying expression @xmath93 by @xmath94 .",
    "eventually we obtain the operator @xmath95 as given by eq .",
    "( [ eqm2 ] ) but with @xmath96 replaced by @xmath97 eq .",
    "( [ massrun1 ] ) corresponds to a parametrization of right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ massrun2 ] ) . obviously in principle @xmath98 should be obtained by actually solving the ds equation for @xmath90 ( ref .",
    "[ 3b,4b,4c ] ) , but this is a complicated task that we reserve to a forthcoming paper",
