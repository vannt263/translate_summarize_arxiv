    "[ fig : tcib ]",
    "we now present a novel method to estimate the extent to which known sources and their faint companions contribute to the cib .",
    "we do this by exploiting an inherent weakness of stacking : that stacking on images with poor angular resolution can result in a boosted ( or biased ) average flux density arising from faint , uncatalogued , companion galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the trick is in recognizing that only _ correlated _",
    "( i.e. , clustered ) sources will bias the stacked flux density ( for an in - depth discussion see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that summed intensities estimated with increasingly smoothed maps places limits on the full intensity in a given redshift range .",
    "meanwhile , emission that is not correlated  say , emission coming from sources at redshifts greater than those of our catalog objects  will not influence the primary measurement , except as a potential noise term .",
    "for this analysis we use the publicly - available simstack  code , which is described in detail in @xcite . briefly , synthetic images of the sky are constructed from _ correlated _ subsets of catalogs ( i.e. , objects in the same redshift range ) with the assumption that galaxies that are physically similar  in this case quiescent or star - forming galaxies within a stellar mass bin  have comparable infrared luminosities and submillimeter flux densities .",
    "synthetic images are then convolved with the psf of the instrument , and are fit simultaneously to the actual sky map to retrieve the mean flux densities of the subsample .    to induce a bias we smooth the maps by convolving them with gaussians whose widths are the geometric differences of the nominal spire and effective beams , i.e. , @xmath21 , where the nominal spire resolutions are 17.5 , 23.7 , and 34.6arcsec full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) at 250 , 350 , and 500@xmath0 m , respectively , and the effective resolutions are 20 , 30 , 40 , 60 , 80 , 110 , 140 , 180 , 220 , 260 , and 300arcsec fwhm . above 300arcsec , statistical uncertainties become consistent with zero ( see section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "all synthetic images and sky maps are mean - subtracted before stacking .",
    "following @xcite we split the sample into @xmath22 bins of redshift ( @xmath23 to 4 with @xmath24 ) and stellar mass ( 5 star - forming and 3 quiescent ) , and stack the subsamples with simstack  at each smoothing scale .",
    "stacked flux densities are then color - corrected to account for the observed spectral shape of the sources through the passbands , with temperatures taken from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation  18 ) .",
    "color corrections range between , 1.0060.984 , 0.9930.977 , and 1.0070.991 at 250 , 350 , and 500@xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "[ fig : stackedflux ]    we use simulations to check that stacking and smoothing with a gaussian , as opposed to the measured spire beam or any other kernel , is a reasonable approximation , finding a bias of less than 4% for the largest smoothing kernel , which we include in the reported errors .",
    "we test that the method does not introduce unintended biases by performing 100 null tests for each set of synthetic images and maps .",
    "null tests involve running the identical stacking pipeline with the same binning of sources , but after randomizing the positions of the sources in the catalogs . because the map and images are mean - subtracted , we expect the stacked flux densities of the null tests to be consistent with zero . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] we show that this is the case .",
    "we note that this method has the advantage that missing sources are not double - counted , meaning that the flux density from a single missing object will be distributed among the synthetic images , rather than appearing multiple times ( as would be the case in thumbnail stacking ) .",
    "also note that stacked flux densities are intentionally _ not _ corrected for completeness because it is precisely the flux densities of the missing ( i.e. , incomplete , but similarly applies to misclassified agn or dsfgs ) sources that we are attempting to measure by degrading the effective resolution of the map . as a result , this technique is not limited to cib studies , but is applicable to any study where estimates of the level of faint , correlated emission are in question .",
    "we report total intensities of our stacking measurement as the cumulative sum over redshift ( from @xmath25 to the redshifts labeled with different color lines ) vs. the effective resolution of the image , in figure  [ fig : tcib ] . at lower redshifts ( @xmath26 )",
    "the fractional cib that is measured increases weakly with increasing effective beam size , which is expected given that the completeness of the catalog at these redshifts is near unity for stellar masses log(@xmath27 .",
    "conversely , at higher redshifts the fractional cib that is measured increases rapidly with increased smoothing .",
    "the maximum cib we resolve is @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 at 250 , 350 , and 500@xmath0 m .",
    "we note slightly different behaviors between the three bands ; particularly at 500@xmath0 m , which appears to have not converged , and may be indicative of higher redshift contributions to the cib .",
    "estimates of the exact measured fraction of the absolute cib are limited by the uncertainties in the reported absolute values of the cib derived from firas spectra by @xcite and @xcite , which range between 22% and 30% .",
    "the @xcite levels ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ; hereafter chosen to represent the fiducial values ) are shown as dashed lines in figure  [ fig : tcib ] , and the @xcite levels ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) are shown as 3-dot - dashed lines . additionally , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dot - dashed lines ) provide estimates of the total cib by extrapolating their measured counts , finding they agreed with firas with similarly large uncertainties .",
    "in total we find that the fraction of the @xcite fiducial cib we resolve is @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 at 250 , 350 , and 500@xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "the full set of 100 null tests at each effective beam size are shown as gray dotted lines in figure  [ fig : tcib ] , with the 1@xmath18 limits represented by the shaded grey region .",
    "for clarity only the tests for @xmath12 are shown .",
    "as expected , the results of the null tests fluctuate around zero , with the magnitude of that fluctuation increasing with increasing effective beam size .",
    "additional systematic uncertainties include calibration and beam area uncertainties , and cosmic variance , which is estimated following @xcite .    , combine parametric descriptions for the stacked flux densities ( at the native resolution of the images ) and the stellar mass functions ( see figure  [ fig : stackedflux ] ) .",
    "extrapolated counts from @xcite are shown as gray squares . also shown",
    "are cumulative cib intensities vs. redshift on stacks made with the native ( i.e. , non - smoothed ) spire images ( diamonds ) , and the models after they have been modified to reflect the incompleteness of the actual catalog ( dashed lines ) . ,",
    "scaledwidth=51.0% ]    [ fig : didz ]",
    "the cib can be divided into three components : ( 1 ) the contribution from the sources in the parent @xmath34 catalog ; ( 2 ) the contribution from correlated companion sources that for some reason do not make the catalog cut but are recovered with our smoothing - stacking method ; and ( 3 ) uncorrelated emission , including and likely dominated by sources lying at @xmath35 .",
    "it is interesting to consider the nature of ( 2 ) , the undetected sources that are captured by our smoothing procedure : are they very low - mass galaxies ; massive but dusty galaxies that evade detection in current deep @xmath36-selected catalogs ; or some other unknown component ?",
    "we now propose  through a simple model that combines a parametric description of the stellar mass function with simple fits to nominal stacked flux densities  that the galaxies that make up the stellar mass function are alone able to describe our measurement , and that by extension the missing cib can reasonably be attributed to galaxies in the low - mass end of the stellar mass function .",
    "the first component of the model adopts the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation  1 ) parameterization of the @xcite stellar mass function .",
    "the rightmost panel of figure  [ fig : stackedflux ] illustrates the performance of the @xcite model ( solid lines ) against the @xcite data ( circles ) .",
    "we find that it diverges from the measurements at higher redshifts and so we add a modification at @xmath37 ( dotted lines ) by simply interpolating between the model and the measured stellar mass functions of @xcite to @xmath38 .",
    "we check that the exact value of faint - end slope at high-@xmath39 negligibly affects the integral , and set it to -1.6 .",
    "similarly , the second component of the model consists of power - law fits to the stacked flux densities vs. lookback time for each stellar mass bin , with the added condition that the mass dependence of the slopes and offsets themselves follow smooth functions .",
    "the three left panels of figure  [ fig : stackedflux ] show the stacked flux densities and best - fit power laws as open circles with error bars , and dotted lines , respectively . finally , the model is integrated over the redshift range @xmath404 , and stellar mass range log(@xmath4114 ; although the contribution from galaxies below log(@xmath42 is found to be negligible .",
    "figure  [ fig : didz ] compares the resulting model ( solid lines ) with the full cib measurements ( open circles ) at all three wavelengths .",
    "note that model is not a fit , and yet describes the measurement remarkably well , demonstrating that the faint - end of the mass function can plausibly explain the recovered cib .",
    "also in good agreement are the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gray squares ) estimates derived through extrapolation of their number counts .",
    "we note some tension with the @xcite intensity at 350@xmath0 m  ( @xmath43 ) , which is an output of their halo model fit to cib power spectra ; although their 550@xmath0 m  estimate from the same model is in relative agreement ( @xmath44 ) .    also shown ( as diamonds )",
    "are measurements made when stacking on the native spire images ( i.e. , no smoothing ) .",
    "they are again compared to the model ( dashed lines ) , but this time the model is modified so that the low - mass limit of the integral over the mass function effectively begins at higher masses with increasing redshift , reflecting the completeness behavior of the catalog .",
    "the difference between the solid and dashed lines can be interpreted as a measure of how much of the cib originates from the parent sample , and how much is from companion sources not detected at this @xmath45 limit .",
    "if , for arguments sake , the catalog were 100% complete at all stellar masses and all redshifts , then the dashed and solid lines would overlap .",
    "arguments for additional , diffuse , sources of cib ; in particular dust in the extended halos of galaxies @xcite , are thus disfavored .      while our measurements are consistent with the fiducial levels of the total cib , the existing uncertainties on the absolute level are so large that it is difficult to convincingly estimate how much cib is still unresolved .",
    "any missing cib is more likely to occur at longer wavelengths , which are more sensitive to higher redshifts ( because of the negative @xmath36-correction ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , from where we would expect uncorrelated emission to originate .",
    "indeed , several exceptional ulirg - like galaxies have been identified at @xmath10 , albeit with low abundances ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , extrapolations of the contribution of ulirgs to the star - formation rate density at @xmath10 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) points to them dominating the far - infrared emission at this epoch . determining the relative levels that they and less luminous galaxies contribute is a key question going forward .    to resolve these high-@xmath39 questions ,",
    "more data are required ; particularly : 1 ) an update of the absolute cib ; 2 ) deeper catalogs with stellar masses and redshifts to redshifts greater than 4 ; 3 ) submillimeter surveys ( 350 to 1000@xmath0 m ) with large angular - scale fidelity and smaller psfs in the regions of those deep catalogs  particularly at longer wavelengths which are more sensitive to galaxies at higher redshifts .",
    "the former can only be achieved with space - based missions to measure the dc level above atmospheric foregrounds .",
    "the second requirement is steadily growing from multiple current or upcoming efforts ( e.g. , sdss / boss , candles , des , lsst ) , although the photometric redshifts for very dusty galaxies may remain quite uncertain ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the last point will require a ground - based submillimeter observatory similar in scope to ccat @xcite .",
    "we find that most of the cib at 250 , 350 , and 500@xmath0 m   can be accounted for by galaxies detected in current near - infrared surveys of moderate depth ( @xmath46 ) , and galaxies correlated with them .",
    "we report total intensities of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 at 250 , 350 , and 500@xmath0 m , which corresponds to a fraction of the @xcite absolute cib of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "we find that a simple model combining parametric descriptions for the stellar mass function and stacked flux densities for log(@xmath9 and @xmath12 is able to convincingly reproduce the measurements , which supports the argument that the sources in the faint - end of the mass function make up the previously missing cib .",
    "we note that emission from objects that are not in the catalog , _ and _ is either uncorrelated with catalog objects or exists at scales greater than 300arcsec , would be missed .",
    "however unlikely , this can not be ruled out without a better absolute measurement to compare against .",
    "finally , we propose that any remaining cib likely originates from galaxies at @xmath10 , and if so should be detectable at submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths .",
