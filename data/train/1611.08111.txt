    "a familiar perspective on the hydromagnetic description of astrophysical and laboratory plasma turbulence begins with the interaction of oppositely propagating large amplitude incompressible wave packets @xcite .",
    "various nonlinear phenomenologies are built on this paradigm @xcite .",
    "an essential feature is that large amplitude perturbations in which velocity @xmath0 and magnetic field @xmath1 fluctuations are alfvnically correlated , i.e. either @xmath2 or @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are uniform background alfvn velocity and magnetic field , respectively ) , are exact stable solutions to the equations of incompressible magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) @xcite .",
    "one thread emerging from this concerns the analysis of colliding wave packets to reveal properties of the mhd turbulence spectrum @xcite .",
    "a different emphasis was given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both of these treatments analyzed the collision of large amplitude incompressible , ideal alfvn wave packets noting that nonlinear interaction and mutual distortion of the wave packets are limited to the span of time during which they spatially overlap . both _",
    "moffatt _ and _ parker _ argued ( somewhat differently , as discussed later ) that the packets eventually separate and propagate once again undisturbed without further interactions .",
    "this paper addresses two questions that arise when trying to apply this physical insight to high temperature extraterrestrial plasmas such as the solar wind , where such large amplitude alfvnic fluctuations are routinely observed @xcite , or solar corona , where the interaction of alfvnic wave packets is thought to occur @xcite .",
    "first , both compressibility effects and kinetic plasma are likely to be important in space applications , and we ask if these give rise to significant departures from the the parker - moffatt scenario .",
    "second , we ask whether the proposed separation of the packets after collision is realized as envisioned , or if a wake of non - propagating disturbances might remain after very long times .",
    "we address these specific questions using a compressible mhd model and a hybrid vlasov model .",
    "broader questions that emerge will be discussed in the concluding remarks .    in dealing with low mach number quasi - incompressible fluid or mhd models , either in numerical simulations @xcite , applications @xcite , or in analytical theory @xcite ,",
    "one routinely deals with two significant properties : first , the dominant quadratic couplings are of the form @xmath6 , transferring energy into ( or from ) fourier mode with wave - vector @xmath7 due to nonlinear interactions with modes at wave - vectors @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "one concludes that in general ( unless , e.g. , all excited wave vectors are co - linear ) one expects excitations to spread rapidly among many wave - vectors , a process that over time can produce complex mixing and turbulent flows .",
    "second , incompressible mhd nonlinear evolution proceeds as @xmath10 and @xmath11 in terms of elssser variables @xmath12 ( @xmath13th components of velocity field @xmath14 and magnetic field @xmath15 in alfvn speed units ) , thus allowing the immediate conclusion that nonlinear couplings vanish unless the elssser fields @xmath16 and @xmath17 have nonzero overlap somewhere in space .",
    "these properties not only provide motivation for the alfvn wave packet collision problem , but also enter into some of its complexity as an elementary interaction that generates turbulence @xcite .    beyond the assumption of incompressibility , we may anticipate genuinely compressible and kinetic effects that warrant examination in the large amplitude wave packets collision problem . in the solar wind for example , many intervals , especially within 1 au @xcite or at high latitudes @xcite",
    "are highly alfvnic , but even within such intervals there are mixtures of elssser amplitudes , small density variations , and a small parallel variance , as in the well - quoted `` 5:4:1 '' variance ratio reported by @xcite .",
    "there have also been reports of interplanetary magneto - sonic wave packets interaction @xcite , while the great power - law in the interstellar medium @xcite is associated with electron density fluctuations that may be either propagating or non - propagating @xcite .",
    "furthermore in plasmas such as the solar wind , at smaller scales near the ion inertial scale , one expects kinetic properties @xcite such as spectral steepening @xcite , dispersive wave effects @xcite of both kinetic alfvn wave and whistler types , along with temperature anisotropy , beams and other distortions of the proton velocity distribution function ( vdf ) @xcite .",
    "these complications place the problem of collisions of alfvn wave packets in a much more complex framework .",
    "motivated by these considerations , we revisit the problem of two colliding large amplitude alfvn wave packets by means of compressible fluid and kinetic vlasov - maxwell simulations .",
    "the shown results are from a magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) model and a hybrid kinetic plasma ( hvm ) model .",
    "both retain @xmath18 dimensions in the physical space , with three cartesian fluid velocities and field components , but with gradients only in the @xmath19 plane .",
    "the hvm model has also a three dimensional velocity space grid .",
    "it is clear that this problem would be better addressed in a high resolution fully 3d representation in physical space .",
    "however , computational cost limits accessible 3d simulations to relatively low spatial resolution . this present geometry is favored because it allows for a large system size , that , in turn , ensures a large reynolds number and hence mhd like turbulent dynamics @xcite , as well as a realistic realization of compressive fluctuations / parallel variances @xcite .",
    "the dimensionless mhd equations are : @xmath20\\label{eq : hmhd2 } \\\\ & \\partial_t { \\bf b } = \\nabla \\times \\left ( { \\bf u}\\times { \\bf b } \\right ) \\label{eq : hmhd3 } \\\\ & \\partial_t t + ( { \\bf u}\\cdot \\nabla)t + ( \\gamma -1)t(\\nabla \\cdot { \\bf u})=0 \\label{eq : hmhd4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in eqs .",

    ". moreover , @xmath36 is a typical value for the kinetic to magnetic pressure ratio ; @xmath37 is the adiabatic index .",
    "details about the numerical algorithm can be found in @xcite .",
    "the kinetic simulations solve the hybrid vlasov - maxwell equations system @xcite in which the proton distribution function is numerically evolved while electrons are a massless maxwellian , isothermal fluid .",
    "dimensionless hvm equations are : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the proton distribution function . in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hvm1])([eq : hvm3 ] ) , velocities @xmath40 are scaled to the alfvn speed @xmath41 , while the proton number density @xmath42 and the proton bulk velocity @xmath43 , obtained as moments of the distribution function , are normalized to @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the electric field @xmath46 , the current density @xmath47 and the electron pressure @xmath48 are scaled to @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "finally , the parameter @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the proton skin depth , allows a comparison of fluid and kinetic scales .",
    "electron inertia effects have been neglected in the ohm s law and no external resistivity @xmath54 is introduced .",
    "a detailed description of the hvm algorithm can be found in @xcite .",
    "the simulations are set up as follows .",
    "the spatial domain @xmath55\\times[0,2\\pi]$ ] has been discretized with @xmath56 mesh points , thus implying @xmath57 and also an anisotropic wave - vectors space .",
    "spatial boundary conditions are periodic . in the hvm run",
    ", we adopted a uniform velocity space grid with @xmath58 points in each direction , in the region @xmath59 $ ] , being @xmath60 .",
    "velocity domain boundary conditions assume @xmath61 for @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "in our simulation we set @xmath64 , which corresponds to @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "the background magnetic field is mainly perpendicular to the @xmath67 plane , indeed @xmath68 , being @xmath69 = 6^\\circ$ ] and @xmath70 .",
    "we impose large amplitude magnetic @xmath1 and bulk velocity @xmath0 perturbations .",
    "density perturbations are not imposed , which implies nonzero total pressure fluctuations . in the hvm case , the proton vdf is initially maxwellian at each spatial point .",
    "initial perturbations consist of two alfvnic wave packets with opposite velocity - magnetic field correlation , separated along @xmath71 . because @xmath72 , the packets counter - propagate .",
    "the nominal time for the collision , which has been evaluated from the center of each wave packet , is about @xmath73 .",
    "the magnetic field perturbation @xmath74 has been created by initializing energy in the first four wave - numbers in the @xmath75 direction while , due to the @xmath71 spatial localization ( enforced by projection ) , many wave - numbers along @xmath71 are excited initially .",
    "then , a small @xmath76 component has been introduced in such a way that the transverse condition , @xmath77 , is hold in each domain point .",
    "finally , the velocity field perturbation @xmath78 is generated by imposing that @xmath78 and @xmath74 are correlated ( anti - correlated ) for the wave packet which moves against ( along ) the magnetic field @xmath79 .",
    "the intensity of the perturbation is @xmath80 , therefore the mach number is @xmath81 .",
    "the intensity of fluctuations with respect to the in - plane field @xmath79 is quite strong , with a value of about @xmath82 .",
    "it is worth to note that the inverse of the intensity of the fluctuations with respect to the in - plane magnetic field is related to the parameter @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the characteristic nonlinear time and @xmath85 is the characteristic collision time .",
    "if @xmath86 , several nonlinear times occur in a single collision and wave packets can be significantly perturbed by nonlinear effects . on the other hand , if @xmath87 , many collisions are necessary to strongly distort wave packets . by evaluating @xmath88 ( wave packet width @xmath89 , perturbations amplitude @xmath90 ) and @xmath91 ( in - plane alfvn propagation speed @xmath92 )",
    ", it turns out that @xmath93 .",
    "therefore our simulations stand in a parameter range where nonlinear effects can be such important that a strong turbulence scenario may be present .",
    "the imposed initial perturbations correspond to two large amplitude alfvn wave packets in the sense that magnetic and velocity perturbations are fully correlated in each packet , and the packets are separated in space . with zero density variation , a weak in - plane uniform magnetic field , and a relatively strong out of plane uniform magnetic field ,",
    "this initial condition is one for which the reasoning of moffatt and parker discussed above would be applicable in the context of an incompressible model .",
    "in addition , the initial data also exactly satisfy the transversality condition @xmath94 , which in linear compressible mhd would correspond to the alfvn eigenmode , if indeed the amplitude were infinitesimal . here",
    "the amplitude is large , so small amplitude theory is unlikely to be relevant to the nonlinear evolution .",
    "furthermore , the condition of the proper alfvn eigenmode obtained in large amplitude compressible mhd theory , namely @xmath95 is not satisfied by our initial perturbations @xcite .",
    "this suggests that pressure and density fluctuations may be generated during the wave packets evolution",
    ". therefore the initial data are nonlinear eigenmodes of incompressible mhd , but not exact eigenmodes of compressible mhd . on the other hand we do not expect significant differences because the initial @xmath96 fluctuations are not very large ( less than @xmath97 ) .",
    "future works will analyze the evolution in the case in which @xmath98 at @xmath99 , and in the framework of other plasma models , such as hall mhd and particle in cell ( pic ) kinetic plasma models .",
    "an overview of the dynamics in the two simulations ( mhd and hvm ) can be appreciated by inspection of the evolution of the out - of - plane component of the current density @xmath100 , reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : jz ] . left and right columns of fig .",
    "[ fig : jz ] refer to the mhd and hvm simulations , respectively .",
    "the rows refer to different instants of time : top , center and bottom rows respectively indicate @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 . in both simulations the initially separated wave packets counter - propagate , approach each other [ top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : jz ] ] , and collide at @xmath104 . during the collision [ center panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : jz ] ] , @xmath105 intensifies , and , since the overlapping wave packets interact nonlinearly , the dynamics produces small scales that can be easily appreciated by examining the width of the current structures in the center row of fig .",
    "[ fig : jz ] . at the final stages of the simulations [ bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : jz ] ] , the wave packets continue their motion while displaying a significantly perturbed shape .",
    "indeed the @xmath105 contours indicate that current structures are much more complex after that the collision occurs .",
    "moreover , their shape exhibits also a curvature which is not anticipated prior to the collision and which indicates the presence of energy in modes with gradients along the @xmath75 direction , transverse to the propagation .",
    "the mhd and hvm evolutions exhibit noticeable differences : the mhd case is symmetric with respect to @xmath106 , while this symmetry is lost in the vlasov run also before the collision [ right top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : jz ] ] .",
    "the lack of the symmetry in the hvm run may be due to the inter - coupling of @xmath79 and dispersive effects which are present in the hvm run and may cause a different propagation along and against @xmath79 .",
    "the hvm run also forms smaller scales during the interaction than in the mhd case .",
    "this difference can be appreciated in the right , center panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : jz ] . finally , after the collision , @xmath105 is much more complex in the hvm simulation than in the mhd run .",
    "very thin current sheet structures and secondary ripples are observed only in the vlasov case .",
    "the nature of these secondary ripples may be associated with the presence of some kaw - like fluctuations @xcite and will be analyzed in detail in a separate paper .",
    "a point of comparison of our simulations with respect to the theoretical ideas given by moffatt and parker is to examine the behavior of cross helicity .",
    "those theoretical treatments assume ideal non - dissipative conditions , so that the total cross helicity is conserved and moreover the expectation is that the separate wave packets after the collision have the same cross helicity as prior to the interaction .",
    "furthermore the initial and final states , in the ideal treatment , have equipartition of flow and magnetic field energy , with departures from equipartition possible during the interaction . to examine these , fig .",
    "[ fig : hc ] shows the temporal evolution of ( a ) the normalized cross - helicity @xmath107 , and ( b ) the normalized residual energy @xmath108 @xcite , respectively defined as @xmath109 and @xmath110 , where @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the normalized cross - helicity @xmath107 is well - preserved in the mhd simulation , while , in the kinetic simulation , @xmath107 displays , around the collision time @xmath115 , a significant growth followed by a saturation stage .",
    "it is worth to note that , in the mhd run , @xmath107 is still conserved despite @xmath107 is an invariant of the incompressible mhd while our mhd simulation is compressible [ compressibility could , in principle , break the invariance of @xmath107 ] .",
    "this characteristic reflects the fact that the compressive fluctuations which are dynamically generated during the mhd evolution are not strong enough to break the invariance of @xmath107 . on the other hand",
    ", the breaking of the @xmath117 invariance in the vlasov run is associated with the presence of both dispersive and kinetic effects . indeed , by evaluating the incompressible hall mhd invariant @xmath118 ( generalized helicity ) @xcite ,",
    "@xmath118 is also not preserved for the hvm run and it shows a similar behavior of @xmath117 ( in particular a jump is recovered at @xmath119 ) .",
    "this feature suggests that the production of @xmath107 recovered in the kinetic simulation can not be associated only with dispersive effects , which are taken into account in the hall model , but is also due to the presence of kinetic effects .",
    "in contrast the evolution of the residual energy @xmath108 is very similar in the mhd and hvm simulations . referring to fig .",
    "[ fig : hc ] ( b ) , we see that in the initial stages @xmath120 , then @xmath121 strongly oscillates during the wave packets collisions , first to positive values indicating a positive correlation of the elssser fields , then moving more strongly towards negative values of correlation , and returning to positive correlation again prior to finally approaching zero once again .",
    "it is clear that during the collision there is substantial exchange of kinetic and magnetic energy , and this is not greatly influenced by kinetic effects .    in order to compare the role of small scale dynamics in the two cases",
    ", we computed the mean square out - of - plane electric current density @xmath122 as a function of time .",
    "this is illustrated in the top panel of figure [ fig : enst ] for the mhd ( black ) and kinetic hvm ( red ) runs . in both cases",
    ", @xmath123 shows a similar time evolution .",
    "in particular , both models show a peak of @xmath123 around the collision time @xmath124 . after the collision",
    ", a high - intensity current activity persists and the peak of current activity is reached in the final stage of the simulations .",
    "other quantities that provide further physical details about the simulations are @xmath125 , the density fluctuations providing a measure of compressibility , and @xmath126 , the mean square vorticity or enstrophy , where @xmath127 and @xmath128 . panels ( b ) and ( c ) of figure [ fig : enst ] respectively show @xmath125 and @xmath126 for both simulations .",
    "the density fluctuations peak around @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the first peak is due to the interaction between the two wave packets .",
    "the second peak of density fluctuations appears to be due to propagation of magneto - sonic fluctuations generated by the initial strong collision .",
    "once generated these modes propagate across the periodic box and provide an `` echo '' of the original collision .",
    "we also note that in the initial stage of both simulations , @xmath131 exhibits some small modulations , which could be produced by the absence of a pressure balance in the initial condition .    the enstrophy @xmath132 evolution , also shown in fig . [ fig : enst ] , indicates that both mhd and hvm cases produce fine scale structure in the velocity , i.e. , vortical structures , during the collisions , and these persist after the collision .",
    "however , in the mhd case @xmath132 reaches larger values compared to the hvm case .",
    "this could be due to the presence of kinetic damping effects which decrease the intensity of @xmath133 by transferring energy to the vdf [ see .",
    "e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that the general profile of enstrophy and mean square current follow similar trends in time .",
    "this can be expected as the inertial range of turbulence typically provides near - equipartition of velocity and magnetic fluctuation energy , even in fairly simple configurations @xcite .",
    "however , when examined in more detail , one often finds , as here , that the magnetic fluctuations are usually about a factor of two more energetic in the inertial range part of the spectrum , as they are , for example in the solar wind @xcite .",
    "this inequality is here reflected in the fact that @xmath134 .    in order to further characterize the small scales fluctuation generated by the collisions and associated nonlinear activity , we examine the magnetic energy spectra . figs .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] shows , for the vlasov run , the reduced magnetic field power spectral densities @xmath135 ( black ) and @xmath136 ( red ) at ( a ) @xmath101 ; ( b ) @xmath102 ; and ( c ) @xmath103 . here , for example , @xmath135 is a one - dimensional reduced power spectra density obtained by integrating over one component of wave - vector . the blue dashed lines in fig . [",
    "fig : spectra ] indicate a @xmath137 slope for reference .",
    "we remark that the spectra for the hvm run show more energy at very small scales compared to the mhd run ( not shown here ) , again consistent with the idea that the hvm run produces more fine scales than the the mhd simulation .",
    "this may simply indicate that the effective dissipation in the hvm case is smaller than the numerically motivated dissipation coefficients selected for the mhd run .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] we observe that , at @xmath101 , the spectrum @xmath138 is steep due to the localization of the initial condition , which requires involvement of a wide range of wave - numbers @xmath139 .",
    "furthermore , during the evolution , the spectra show a transfer of energy towards small scales , at higher @xmath139 and at higher @xmath140 .",
    "this represents a signature of energy transfer due to nonlinear coupling .",
    "in fact , much of the energy @xmath138 is contained , at @xmath104 , in a bump around @xmath141 , while at @xmath103 the bump is less clear and the spectrum @xmath138 is more developed compared to the one at @xmath104 .",
    "a break in @xmath138 can be also appreciated around @xmath142 .",
    "another feature of the magnetic energy spectra is that @xmath143 , which initially contains less energy than @xmath138 , experiences a significant increase in power , reaching almost the same amplitude at the later times .",
    "this suggests that fluctuations become more isotropic , and that energy transfer is efficient in both directions of the wave - vector space .",
    "we have carried out a comparative study using different plasma simulation methods to examine the dynamical evolution that accompanies the interaction or `` collision '' of two oppositely propagating wave packets .",
    "for the classic case of incompressible mhd , considered by moffatt and by parker , the wave packets are , when considered separately , exact large amplitude solutions of the nonlinear equations , and are , therefore , strictly speaking `` waves '' .",
    "if two such waves , oppositely propagating , become overlapping , nonlinear couplings and turbulence can be produced and the packets are deformed .",
    "moffatt and parker concluded that , after the characteristic interaction time , the packets again separate and continue propagating away from one another without further nonlinear interactions .",
    "hence one question addressed in the present study is whether such separation after a collision actually occurs .",
    "a second question is whether departures from incompressible mhd change the dynamics in an appreciable way . to that end , here we examined a compressible mhd formulation and a hybrid vlasov formulation .",
    "our results show that - when one moves beyond the mhd framework in which the moffatt & parker problem is approached - the dynamics become more complex . here",
    "we find that , in both the present cases , the interactions and the structures produced in the collision are sufficiently complex that it is difficult to determine whether the wave packets actually attain a full separation after the collision . indeed",
    ", we note that very complex current and vorticity structures are produced at small scales in both compressible mhd and hvm cases and these fluctuations are indicative of a spread of energy in the wave vectors plane , which is almost perpendicular to @xmath144 .",
    "the energy spectra evolve toward isotropy in this plane , although one would expect a degree of spectral anisotropy to persist due to the presence of the weak in - plane magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , to the extent that the interaction of the packets has a finite lifetime [ as envisioned e.g. by @xcite ] , any such relaxation would be expected to be incomplete in a single interaction time .",
    "in addition , we recall that in the incompressible ideal problem , cross helicity is conserved , so that after the collision in that case , the separated wave packets will each contain the same energy that was present in the initial state .",
    "however , cross - helicity is not preserved in the kinetic case since dispersive ( e.g. hall effect ) and dissipative effects are present in the simulation .",
    "in fact in the hvm case , we observe a significant change in global cross helicity during the interaction .",
    "this preliminary examination of the fate of the moffatt and parker conjecture in the context of compressible as well as kinetic models has produced a satisfactory , if not complete , picture .",
    "in fact the basic physics of the large amplitude alfvn waves collisions as envisioned by those authors appears to be upheld in this regime .",
    "however , we have neither examined the most general case , which would require full 3d simulations nor have we completely analyzed the compressible and kinetic effects in the present cases .",
    "in particular , not shown here are indications of specific kinetic wave modes and characteristic distortions of the velocity distribution function @xcite that might be expected .",
    "a separate account of these results is in preparation .",
    "we also note that we have analyzed the present problem employing several other models including hybrid particle in cell , hall mhd and also varying the initial conditions .",
