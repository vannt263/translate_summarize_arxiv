    "a very elementary formulation of that principle is @xmath5 whenever @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    in the inverse source problem ,",
    "the far field radiated by a source @xmath8 is its _ restricted _ ( to the unit sphere ) _ fourier transform _ , and the operator that maps the restricted fourier transform of @xmath9 to the restricted fourier transform of its translate @xmath10 is called the _ far field translation operator_. we will prove an uncertainty principle analogous to , where the role of the fourier transform is replaced by the far field translation operator . combining this principle with a _",
    "regularized picard criterion _ , which characterizes the non - evanescent ( i.e. , detectable ) far fields radiated by a ( limited power ) source supported in a ball provides simple proofs and extensions of several results about locating the support of a source and about splitting a far field radiated by well - separated sources into the far fields radiated by each source component .",
    "we also combine the regularized picard criterion with a more conventional uncertainty principle for the map from a far field in @xmath11 to its fourier coefficients .",
    "this leads to a data completion algorithm which tells us that we can deduce missing data ( i.e.  on part of @xmath12 ) if we know _ a priori _ that the source has small support .",
    "all of these results can be combined so that we can simultaneously complete the data and split the far fields into the components radiated by well - separated sources .",
    "we discuss both @xmath13 ( least squares ) and @xmath14 ( basis pursuit ) algorithms to accomplish this .",
    "perhaps the most significant point is that all of these algorithms come with bounds on their condition numbers ( both the splitting and data completion problems are linear ) which we show are sharp in their dependence on geometry and wavenumber .",
    "these results highlight an important difference between the inverse source problem and the inverse scattering problem .",
    "the conditioning of the linearized inverse scattering problem does not depend on wavenumber , which means that the conditioning does not deteriorate as we increase the wavenumber in order to increase resolution .",
    "the conditioning for splitting and data completion for the inverse source problem does , however , deteriorate with increased wavenumber , which means the dynamic range of the sensors must increase with wavenumber to obtain higher resolution .",

    "setting a problem that is somewhat similar to far field splitting is the representation of highly sparse signals in overcomplete dictionaries .",
    "corresponding stability results for basis pursuit reconstruction algorithms have been established in @xcite .    the numerical algorithms for far field splitting that we are going to discuss have been developed and analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the novel mathematical contribution of the present work is the stability analysis for these algorithms based on new uncertainty principles , and their application to data completion . for alternate approaches to far field splitting that however , so far , lack a rigorous stability analysis we refer to @xcite",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we provide the theoretical background for the direct and inverse source problem for the two - dimensional helmholtz equation with compactly supported sources . in section  [ sec : regpicard ]",
    "we discuss the singular value decomposition of the restricted far field operator mapping sources supported in a ball to their radiated far fields , and we formulate the regularized picard criterion to characterize non - evanescent far fields . in section  [ sec : uncertainty ] we discuss uncertainty principles for the far field translation operator and for the fourier expansion of far fields , and in section  [ sec : l2corollaries ] we utilize those to analyze the stability of least squares algorithms for far field splitting and data completion .",
    "section  [ sec : l1corollaries ] focuses on corresponding results for @xmath15 algorithms .",
