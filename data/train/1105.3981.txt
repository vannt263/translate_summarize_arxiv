    "quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) effects in a strong electromagnetic field attract a lot of attention @xcite . in the last decade a new surge of interest in qed effects in superstrong electromagnetic field arises thanks to substantial progress in laser technologies @xcite .",
    "theoreticians are considering such effects as vacuum polarization in laser field @xcite , electron - positron ( @xmath0 ) pair production from vacuum in the field of colliding laser pulses @xcite and in combined coulomb and strong laser field @xcite etc .    up to now",
    "the electromagnetic fields are not so intense in laboratory to observe strong - field qed effects directly .",
    "however , the interaction of ultra - high energy electron beams with electromagnetic fields can be used to study the effects as in the frame of the relativistic electron the electromagnetic field can be very strong .",
    "the spectra of the scattered electrons and photons arising from the nonlinear compton scattering of intense laser pulse by @xmath1  gev electron beam have been measured experimentally @xcite . the @xmath0 pair production has been also observed .",
    "the strong - field qed effects like channeling radiation and @xmath2 pair production at the interaction of relativistic electron beam with crystalline fields has been also studied experimentally and theoretically @xcite . a number of theoretical and numerical models for qed effects accompanying an interaction of relativistic electrons with strong electromagnetic fields has been developed .",
    "the evolution of the distribution functions of electrons , positrons and hard photons in qed - strong pulsed laser fields interacting with electron beams were found numerically @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite multiphoton trident pair production in strong laser field was studied in a manifestly nonperturbative domain in the periodic plane wave approximation .",
    "in addition , the energy spectrum of positrons produced in collision of strong laser pulse with high - energy electron beam was calculated . the trident pair production amplitude in a strong laser background",
    "was also calculated in ref .",
    "as opposed to @xcite , the finite pulse durations were allowed , while the laser fields were still treating nonperturbatively in strong - field qed .",
    "the individual contributions of the one - step and two - step processes were explicitely identified .",
    "another effect that can be very important at high intensities is the generation of electromagnetic cascades @xcite .",
    "the cascades develop as follows .",
    "a slow electron can be accelerated in superstrong laser fields up to very high energy .",
    "then it can produce a high - energy photon @xmath3 by compton scattering with @xmath4 laser photons involved in the process : @xmath5 the resulting photon creates a pair in a photon - multiphoton collision : @xmath6 this reaction can be considered as the strong - field generalization of the breit ",
    "wheeler process @xcite .",
    "the produced electron and positron as well as the initial ( seed ) electron are accelerated by the field and become capable to produce new high - energy photons by the process .",
    "hence , the number of the particles grows rapidly due to the deposition of the laser energy into the particle acceleration . as a result",
    ", the relativistic electron - positron - gamma plasma is produced . besides pair creation by consecutive processes and",
    ", the particle multiplication can occur by the process of bethe  heitler type ( or trident process ) @xcite : @xmath7 .",
    "however , the threshold intensity for cascade development is about @xmath8 , and for modern laser system the characteristic wavelength is about @xmath9 . at such parameters the overall probability of processes and are much higher than the probability of the bethe  heitler process .",
    "the seed @xmath10 pair can be created as a result of the instability of qed vacuum in strong electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "the probability of the vacuum pair creation increases in the field of two colliding laser pulses @xcite or in the focused laser pulse @xcite .",
    "however , the threshold intensity for the pair creation by colliding and focused laser pulses with @xmath11 is very high and can be up to @xmath12 for the pulse duration @xmath13 and circular polarization @xcite .",
    "the use of high - energy photons as a seed for the cascade is more preferable than that of free electrons and positrons because the ponderomotive force of the laser pulses pushes the charged particles out from the high - intensity region .",
    "the seed particles can be also produced by atom ionization @xcite or pair production in the superposition of laser field and the coulomb field of heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "when the number of the created cascade particles becomes large the plasma effects are important and the significant amount of the laser energy can be absorbed due to production and heating of the electron - positron pair plasma .",
    "this can limit the attainable intensity of high - power lasers @xcite .",
    "the dimensionless parameters characterizing qed effects can be introduced @xcite : @xmath14 \\right)_{\\perp } } { e_{cr } } \\gamma,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the @xmath16vector of the field potential , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the electric and magnetic field strength , respectively , @xmath19 is the field - strength tensor , @xmath20 is the particle four - momentum , @xmath3 is the particle lorentz factor ( @xmath21 for the photon ) , @xmath22 is the particle velocity , @xmath23 is the qed critical field strength , @xmath24 is the value of electron charge , @xmath25 is the electron mass , @xmath26 is the speed of light , @xmath27 is the planck constant , @xmath28 is the photon frequency , @xmath29 is the laser frequency , symbol @xmath30 denotes the component which is perpendicular to the particle velocity .",
    "the first parameter @xmath31 characterizes the laser filed strength . if the laser field is week @xmath32 then mostly @xmath33 in eqs .   and .",
    "in the opposite limit @xmath34 the electron absorbs a large number of photons and the radiation spectrum becomes synchrotron - like @xcite .",
    "the second parameter @xmath35 characterizes the regime of the photon emission . in the limit @xmath36",
    "the radiation can be described classically ( except the case when the number of the emitted photons is small , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) while in the opposite limit the recoil imposed on the electron by the emitted photon is substantial and the quantum approach should be used .",
    "similarly , pair production is significant in the limit @xmath37 while it is exponentially suppressed in the classical limit @xmath38 .    at high intensity",
    "the so - called radiation formation length @xcite becomes much smaller than the laser wavelength and the characteristic path passed by the electron between two consecutive photon emissions .",
    "this regime is often referred as quasistatic or tunneling and can be treated in the framework of quasiclassical approach @xcite .",
    "the compton scattering is treated just as the transition of the electron from one level to another in external constant and homogeneous electromagnetic field that is accompanied by photon emission .",
    "the pair production is considered similarly . in addition",
    ", the quasiclassical approach implies that the particles moves along the classical trajectories between the instances of photon emission or pair production that strongly simplifies calculations .",
    "quantum dynamics of the particles and their interaction are complex phenomena and a number of numerical models is proposed .",
    "there are numerical models based on the first principles like solving dirac s equation and calculating the cross - sections of qed processes @xcite . to simulate collective dynamics of the particles the numerical solution of the kinetic equations",
    "can be used @xcite .",
    "another probably more numerically efficient approach is provided by monte carlo methods .",
    "a number of sophisticated models like well - known geant4 toolkit for the simulation of the passage of particles through matter @xcite are based on monte carlo methods .",
    "monte carlo calculations are also used to analyze the cascade development in the strong electromagnetic fields @xcite . recently",
    "particle - in - cell methods have been also used to simulate the effect of the self - generated electromagnetic fields of the produced @xmath0 pairs on the cascade development @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine and solve analytically the kinetic equations for the particle distribution functions in the electromagnetic cascade in the homogeneous rotating electric field .",
    "this is one of the most simple field configuration where electromagnetic cascades arise . besides",
    ", the rotating electric field can be found in the @xmath39-node of the circularly polarized standing wave formed by two co - propagating circularly polarized laser pulses .",
    "the plane @xmath40 is the most favorable for the cascade development .",
    "however , for the simplicity we consider homogeneous electric field . in order to analyze the particle distribution we use the following assumptions : ( i ) we use the quasiclassical synchrotron formulae for the probabilities of photon emission and pair production , and neglect the angles @xmath41 ; ( ii ) the probability rates are averaged over the polarization of the particles ; ( iii )",
    "the self - generated electromagnetic fields of the particles produced in the cascade are neglected .",
    "the last assumption is valid at the initial stages of the cascade development when the density of the self - generated electron - positron pair plasma is not high @xcite . under the assumption that the number of the cascade particles doubles many times on the period of the field rotation the analytical solutions for the distribution functions",
    "are obtained for the region in the phase space @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the average relativistic factor of the cascade particles .",
    "the obtained solution is used to calculate the energy spectra of the electrons , the positrons and the photons .",
    "the analytical results are compared with the results of the numerical simulations performed using the particle - in - cell monte carlo technique described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we consider the electron , positron and photon motion in the rotating electric field . in sec",
    "iii the cascade kinetic equations for the particle distribution functions are discussed .",
    "the cascade scalings are derived and discussed in sec .",
    "iv and sec . v. the distribution functions of the cascade particles",
    "are derived in sec .",
    "vi . in sec .",

    "viii . finally , in sec .",
    "ix summary and discussion are given .",
    "first we study particle motion in the rotating electric field in the framework of the classical approach , neglecting photon emission and @xmath0 pair production .",
    "the field components are the following : @xmath45 that leads to the following equations of motion @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 are the cartesian coordinates normalized to @xmath49 in the plane of the rotation of the vector @xmath17 , @xmath50 normalized to @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the electron momentum normalized to @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is initial phase .",
    "we are interested only in particle dynamics in the momentum space so far as the electric field is homogeneous .",
    "we introduce @xmath55 universally for all species of the particles as the angle between @xmath56 and @xmath52 .",
    "small and positive values of @xmath55 mean that particle lags behind the vector @xmath57 in the rotation .",
    "then we have : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and eqs .   and",
    "can be rewritten as follows @xmath60 these equations can be reduced to the single equation in the plane @xmath61 : @xmath62 the solution of the equation is the following : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the initial values of the electron momentum and the angle , respectively .",
    "the electron trajectories ( [ phasespace ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_phasespace ]  ( a ) .",
    "the positron trajectories ( fig .",
    "[ fig_phasespace ]  ( b ) ) can be obtained from eq .   by the substitution @xmath66 .",
    "what this means is the positrons are accelerated in the opposite direction to the electron acceleration direction .",
    "the photon momentum does not change during the propagation , and the angle @xmath55 for a photon grows linearly in the course of time @xmath67 .",
    "corresponding trajectories are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_phasespace ]  ( c ) .",
    "the restoration of the particle energy in the cascade can be illustrated using fig .",
    "[ fig_phasespace ] .",
    "let us consider initially immobile electron .",
    "at first , from the point @xmath68 , @xmath69 it is being accelerated along the bold line in fig .",
    "[ fig_phasespace ]  ( a ) ( separatrix ) : @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "then it emits a photon and shifts left : its angle @xmath55 remains the same and its gamma - factor decreases due to the photon emission .",
    "next according to the phase flow the electron comes again to the separatrix .",
    "this also explains why the electrons are concentrated near the separatrix .    as we will see below , the electron distribution function drops along this line due to the following reasons .",
    "first , some of the electrons emit photons and leave the separatrix .",
    "second , the acceleration of the electrons that have higher energy starts earlier in the average than the acceleration of the electrons with lower energies .",
    "the number of particles is increasing exponentially with time in the cascade , hence , the number of particles that gain higher energy is lower .",
    "the cascade kinetic equations have been derived a long time ago to study development of showers initiated by cosmic rays in the earth s atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the shower ( avalanche ) develops due to the bremsstrahlung and pair production at the particle interaction with nuclei .",
    "the solution of the equations has been obtained in ref .",
    "later the solution method has been extended to include multiphoton processes @xcite and to study the electromagnetic showers in strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the kinetic approach have been used in numerical simulations to analyze the interaction of the intense laser pulse with the electron beam @xcite .",
    "the kinetic equations have been also formulated for the problem of the cascade development in the laser field and have been used to derive radiation reaction force @xcite in classical limit in ref .",
    "however , up to now the kinetic cascade equations have been analytically solved only in one - dimensional cases . on the contrary , we consider theoretically and numerically the two - dimensional cascade . moreover , we will take into account that the overall energy of the cascade particles is growing and can be much more than the seed particle energy .",
    "the cascade kinetic equations in arbitrary field can be written as follows :    @xmath72    @xmath73    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the particle coordinate normalized to @xmath49 , @xmath76 is the lorentz force normalized to @xmath77 , @xmath78 is the space dimension , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the distribution functions of the electrons , the positrons and the photons , respectively , which are normalized such that @xmath82 where @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 is the number of the electrons , the positrons and the photons , respectively .",

    "we assume that the photon emission and the pair production occur in synchrotron regime , and we neglect the angles less or about than @xmath92 .",

    "namely , the first term in the rhs of eq",

    "- are the complete set of equations which describes evolution of the distribution functions in the momentum space for the electromagnetic cascade in the rotating electric field .",
    "and @xmath124 . ]",
    "and governing cascade dynamics depend on two parameters : period of the electric field rotation and the field strength .",
    "however , it can be shown that if @xmath125 the number of the parameters can be reduced .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that if @xmath126 and @xmath127 the characteristic time between consecutive photon emissions by the cascade electron ( positron ) are much smaller than the period of the electric field rotation @xmath128 .",
    "in other words , the number of the cascade particles increases in many times during the period of the electric field rotation , @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the cascade growth rate normalized to @xmath29 .",
    "the number of cascade particles increases exponentially @xmath131 .",
    "the simplification of the kinetic equations and the reduction of the number of the governing parameters are possible due to the fact that in this case the cascade particles are concentrated in the regions @xmath132 .",
    "as we will see later it follows from numerical simulations that the condition @xmath132 holds for the most of the particles produced in the cascade .",
    "this can be qualitatively explained as follows .",
    "implies that @xmath133 achieves when the electrons or positrons are accelerated within the time interval about the period of the electric field rotation . if @xmath125 , the electron emits a lot of photons within this time interval and loses a great part of the gained energy .",
    "hence , the electron does not gain high energy from the field and its characteristic momentum is small @xmath134 . in accordance with eq .  , the angle @xmath55 between the electron velocity and the direction opposite to the electric field direction , changes very quickly until @xmath135 .",
    "the photons emitted by the electrons mostly have @xmath132 .",
    "furthermore , for the photons @xmath136 , so they decay before the angle @xmath55 changes significantly .",
    "therefore , it is natural to assume that the distribution functions of the electrons , the positrons and the photons are substantially nonzero only in the region @xmath137 .    using the fact that @xmath138 , the kinetic equations can be simplified as follows .",
    "@xmath132 if @xmath139 or @xmath140 .",
    "let us , for the specificity , consider the region @xmath141 . in this region",
    "the following substitutions can be made in eq .",
    ": @xmath142 , @xmath143 . in the resulting equation as well as in eq .",
    "( with probabilities from eqs .  , ) the following substitution @xmath144 does not change anything except parameter @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is arbitrary quantity .",
    "choosing @xmath147 yields @xmath148 .",
    "the resulting equations for the distribution functions depend only on the parameter @xmath149 they do not depend on the frequency @xmath29 and , hence , on the corresponding wavelength @xmath150 . thus , the dependence of various cascade characteristics on @xmath151 is determined only by the scaling eqs .  - .",
    "for example , it follows from eq .",
    "that for the certain field amplitude and , hence , the intensity @xmath152 , the growth rates at two different wavelengths relates as follows : @xmath153 this formula is in good agreement with the results of the numerical simulations as shown in sec .",
    "vii .     and @xmath154 .",
    "here @xmath155 is the amplitude of the electric field , @xmath29 if the cyclic frequency of the field rotation , @xmath156 . ]",
    "further simplification can be made if we consider high - energy `` tails '' of the distribution functions with @xmath43 .",
    "this let us to simplify the formulae for the spectral distributions of the probabilities eq .  , .",
    "fist , in the region where the probabilities are substantially nonzero , the derivative and the integral of the airy function are of the same order : @xmath158 if @xmath159 .",
    "second , @xmath160 if @xmath161 . hence , as soon as @xmath43 , the terms in eqs .   and that are proportional to the integrals of the airy function can be neglected .",
    "furthermore , @xmath162 is much smaller than unity on a wide interval @xmath163 , and @xmath164 if @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "then in eqs .",
    "and we can set @xmath167 .",
    "however , this lead to appearing of the singularities in the expressions for @xmath94 and @xmath95 , namely @xmath168 at @xmath169 , @xmath170 if @xmath169 and @xmath171 if @xmath172 .",
    "nevertheless , these singularities are integrable and give contributions to the total probability rates that are about @xmath173 times smaller than the total probability rates .",
    "finally , for @xmath174 and @xmath175 we have : @xmath176 and the same expression for @xmath113 except substitution @xmath177 for @xmath178 , where @xmath179 furthermore , eq .   can be used in the same form and eq .",

    "for example , the particles with @xmath187 can also breed and give some contribution to the growth rate .",
    "let us assume that the growth rate is determined only by the particles with @xmath43 , @xmath175 and @xmath188 .",
    "in this case the dependence of @xmath189 on the electric field strength and the wavelength can be determined from eq .   as follows : @xmath190 where @xmath191 .",
    "the dependence eq .   and the scaling eqs .  -",
