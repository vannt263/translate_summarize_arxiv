    "precise measurement of the higgs boson branching ratios ( brs ) is an important task for the international linear collider ( ilc ) program .",
    "it is also crucial for the understanding of the nature of electro - weak symmetry breaking and provides a window to investigate physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . the relatively low background and well - defined initial state of the ilc experiments allow precise , model - independent study of the higgs boson , which is not an easy task for large hadron collider experiments  @xcite .",
    "measurements of the higgs brs to @xmath7 and @xmath8 decays at an @xmath12 linear collider were reported in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this study , we investigate the accuracies of brs of the higgs to @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 using ` geant4 `  @xcite based realistic simulation implemented with a proposed international large detector ( ild )  @xcite .    in this study , we assume a higgs mass of 120  @xmath13 and an integrated luminosity of 250  @xmath14 , and estimate the accuracies of the brs at center - of - mass ( cm ) energies of 250 and 350 gev . the former value is close to the threshold of higgs production and thus is considered as initial target of ilc experiments .",
    "the latter is close to the threshold of top quark pair production ; therefore , higgs data can be corrected simultaneously with a top threshold study .",
    "the difference between kinematical conditions at 250 and 350 gev could yield different detection efficiencies and thus different br accuracies .",
    "the accuracies at 250 and 350 gev under the same conditions are studied and compared .",
    "the experimental conditions for this study are described in section [ sec : ilc ] .",
    "we selected the higgs events in three channels : neutrino , hadronic and leptonic .",
    "the event selection and background suppression processes are described in the section [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "the derivation of the brs is presented in the section [ sec : template ] , and the conclusion is given in the last section .",

    "we used the ild  @xcite model for this study .",
    "the ild , which is the validated detector concept for the ilc , is equipped with a highly segmented calorimeter and a hybrid tracking system consisting of gaseous , silicon - strip , and silicon - pixel trackers .",
    "they provide an excellent jet energy resolution by particle flow analysis , as well as excellent momentum resolution and vertex flavor tagging capability , which are necessary for measuring multi - jet final states in the ilc energy region .",
    "all sub - detector components of the ild are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ild detector ] ; which consists of silicon - pixel vertex detectors ( vtx ) , silicon inner and outer detectors ( sit , set ) , a time projection chamber ( tpc ) , high - granularity electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters ( ecal , hcal ) , a super - conducting solenoid magnet with a @xmath30 magnetic field , and an iron return yoke with a muon detector .",
    "in addition , forward silicon trackers ( ftd , etd ) and beam / luminosity calorimeters ( lcal , lhcal and bcal ) are installed in the forward region .",
    "the vtx system consists of three double layers of silicon pixel sensors with a 2.8 @xmath31 point resolution located at radii between 16 mm and 60 mm , the total radiation length being 0.74% .",
    "the impact parameter resolution ( @xmath32 ) of the vtx system is @xmath33 .",
    "the tpc occupies a volume up to a radius of 1.8 m and a half - length in z of 2.3 m , providing a stand - alone momentum resolution of @xmath34 .",
    "the sit and set are placed at the inner and outer sides of the tpc with 7 and 50 @xmath35 point resolutions in the @xmath36 and @xmath37 directions , respectively .",

    "monte carlo ( mc ) generator samples for the physics study were produced using the ` whizard `  @xcite , and fragmentation and hadronization processes were simulated by ` pythia `  @xcite . the sm higgs branching fractions in ` pythia ` are 65.7% , 3.6% , and 5.5% for @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the generated particles were passed through the ` geant4 `  @xcite based detector simulator ` mokka `  @xcite with the ild model .",
    "the simulated hits were digitized and then reconstructed by the ` marlinreco ` package ; then , the resulting skimmed data were analyzed .",
    "the statistics of the simulated higgs signal samples were 500 @xmath14 for both cm energies of both 250 and 350 gev , whereas those for background processes varied with the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "they are scaled in the analysis in order to obtain results corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 250 @xmath14 .",
    "the major sm background processes for the @xmath46 analysis are @xmath47 and @xmath48 ; thus we considered final sample states of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath55 and @xmath56 backgrounds were also considered for the neutrino and hadronic channels ( but only for @xmath18 because we used a top mass of @xmath57 ) . in the leptonic channel , most of the multi - jet backgrounds are well suppressed if dilepton identification is required ; thus , only the @xmath51 and @xmath50 backgrounds were considered .",
    "we used the 250-gev samples produced for the ild letter of intent ( loi ) studies  @xcite ; thus , their beam parameters correspond to those defined in the ilc reference design report  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the 350-gev samples were newly produced for this study using the updated beam parameter sb2009",
    "the instantaneous luminosities were 0.75 and 1 @xmath58 for 250 and 350 gev , which yield integrated luminosities of 188 and 250 @xmath14 , respectively , for about 3 years at 100 days of operation per year .",
    "depending on the @xmath21 decay mode , the analysis channels are categorized as the neutrino ( dijet ) , hadronic ( four - jets ) and leptonic channels ( dileptons + dijets ) , which are described in the following subsections .      for neutrino channel analysis , particles in the event",
    "are first forcibly clustered into two jets by the durham jet - finding algorithm .",
    "after the dijet clustering , background reductions are applied according to the selection criteria in table  [ table : nnh ] . at a cm energy of 250 gev ,",
    "the higgs is produced almost at rest because it is close to the production threshold , whereas it is boosted at 350 gev .",
    "thus , the cut conditions are optimized to obtain the best s / n at each energy . in this channel",
    ", @xmath21 boson decays invisibly ( @xmath60 ) ; thus , the @xmath49 and @xmath50 processes in the sm are the main backgrounds . to reduce them , a cut on the missing mass ( @xmath61 )",
    "is applied .",
    "although this cut decreases the higgs signal from the ww fusion process , the @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath53 backgrounds are effectively reduced .",
    "@xmath55 background is reduced by the following kinematical cuts : the transverse momentum ( @xmath62 ) , longitudinal momentum ( @xmath63 ) , and maximum momentum ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the @xmath54 background is well reduced by a cut on the number of charged tracks in an event ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "in addition , the @xmath50 background reduction is improved by the @xmath66 and @xmath67 cuts . @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the maximum and the minimum of @xmath68 values ( scaled jet masses ) , respectively , required to cluster the event into two jets .",
    "the background reductions for each cut are summarized in table  [ table : nnh ] for each cm energy .",
    "after all selection criteria are met , an additional likelihood ratio ( @xmath69 ) cut is applied to improve the background reduction .",
    "the @xmath69 is defined using the following variables : @xmath61 , the number of particles ( @xmath70 ) , @xmath66 , @xmath64 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "the likelihood cut positions are optimized to maximize signal significance and @xmath73 and @xmath74 are selected for cm energies of 250 and 350 gev , respectively . the signal significance ( @xmath75 ) after all background reductions is also listed in table  : nnh with its efficiency , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the numbers of higgs signal and background entries , respectively , after all cuts are applied .",
    "the remaining backgrounds are @xmath50 ( 60% ) , @xmath49 ( 20% ) , and @xmath55 ( 10% ) at both 250 and 350 gev .",
    ".summary of the @xmath59 channel background reduction assuming @xmath78 with @xmath79 . [ cols=\"^,^,>,>,^,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the measurement accuracy of the higgs branching fractions , @xmath80 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , were evaluated at @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in terms of signal significance , @xmath18 yields better background suppression than @xmath81 for each channel .",
    "the combined results for measurement accuracies of the higgs cross section times brs ( @xmath83 ) to @xmath80 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are 1.0% , 6.9% , and 8.5% at cm energies of 250 gev and 1.0% , 6.2% , and 7.3% at 350 gev , respectively , assuming the same integrated luminosity of @xmath84 . at the ilc",
    ", the total higgs cross - section @xmath85 is measured using the @xmath21 recoil mass process .",
    "using @xmath86 for 250 gev and assuming it is 3.5% at 350 gev , higgs brs ( @xmath11 ) to @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are derived as 2.7% , 7.3% , and 8.9% at cm energies of 250 gev and as 3.6% , 7.2% , and 8.1% at 350 gev .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the higgs cross section times br ( @xmath87 ) can be measured better at 350 gev than at 250 gev owing to the higher s / n at the higher energy . however , when the accuracy of the total cross section measurement by recoil mass measurement is considered , br of @xmath80 can be measured better at 250 gev , even if the integrated luminosity is the same at both energies .",
