    "_ semidefinite programming _ has turned out to be a very important and valuable tool in polynomial optimization in recent times .",

    "semidefinite programming generalizes linear programming .",
    "the importance of semidefinite programming comes from two facts . on one hand there",
    "exist efficient algorithms to solve semidefinite programming problems , see for example ben - tal and nemirovski @xcite , nesterov and nemirovski @xcite , nemirovski @xcite , vandenberghe and boyd @xcite and wolkowicz , saigal and vandenberghe @xcite . on the other hand , a great amount of problems from various branches of mathematics can be approached using semidefinite programming .",
    "examples come from combinatorial optimization , non - convex optimization and control theory ; see for example parrilo and sturmfels @xcite , gouveia , parrilo and thomas @xcite and all of the above mentioned literature .",
    "this brings up the theoretical question of how to characterize sets on which semidefinite programming can be performed , i.e. to characterize spectrahedra .",
    "helton and vinnikov @xcite have done groundbreaking work towards this question .",
    "they show that spectrahedra are what they call _ rigidly convex _ , and this condition is sufficient in dimension two .",
    "this result also solves the lax conjecture , as explained in lewis , parrilo and ramana @xcite . whether each rigidly convex set of higher dimension",
    "is a spectrahedron is still an open question .",
    "however , it was just recently shown by brndn @xcite that the higher dimensional lax conjecture fails .",
    "observe that semidefinite programming can also be performed on projections of spectrahedra .",
    "one just has to optimize the objective function over a higher dimensional set . up to",
    "now there are only two known necessary conditions for a set to be the projection of a spectrahedron : being convex and being semi - algebraic .",
    "lasserre @xcite has provided a method to prove for certain sets that they are the projection of a spectrahedron .",
    "helton and nie @xcite have applied the method to large classes of convex sets .",
    "they indeed conjecture that each convex semi - algebraic set is the projection of a spectrahedron .",
    "this work is concerned with the question of how to write sets as projections of spectrahedra .",
    "our contribution is the following .",
    "after introducing notation we review in section 3 some of the methods to construct projections of spectrahedra .",
    "we give a unified account of some results spread across the literature , for example on convex hulls of curves , and we prove some helpful facts for which we could not find a reference .",
    "for example we show that the closure of the projection of a spectrahedron is again such a projection .    in section 4",
    "we analyze the lasserre method , and the related theta body method from @xcite .",
    "we prove results on the limitations of these approaches . as a special case",
    "we obtain the main result from @xcite .",
    "we also settle the open questions from that work by providing a series of examples .",
    "finally we proof a positivstellensatz for projections of spectrahedra in section 5 .",
    "this is interesting in particular because such sets are usually not basic closed semialgebraic .",
    "so none from the large amount of known positivstellenstze apply to such sets .",

    "the set @xmath65 is called the _ polar _ of @xmath48 in nemirovksi s work .    in a first step",

    "not very surprisingly , the lasserre result can be recovered from proposition [ trans ]",

    "use the well - known fact that every globally nonnegative quadratic polynomial is a sum of squares of affine linear polynomials , and apply proposition [ trans ] with @xmath179 and @xmath174_2.$ ] again recall that @xmath180_1 ^ 2\\subseteq v$ ] is the projection of a spectrahedron .    in the following result ,",
    "case ( i ) for a full rational curve is proven in henrion @xcite , theorem 1 . in the version",
    "it is stated here it has also been the topic of a talk of parrilo at a workshop in banff in 2006 , but there seems to be no suitable reference . case ( ii )",
    "relies on results of scheiderer , as also explained in @xcite .",
    "[ curve ] let @xmath51 be either    * a semi - algebraic subset of a rational curve , or * a smooth curve of genus @xmath161 with at least one non - real point at infinity .",

    "by @xcite , proposition 2.1 , the conic hull of the projection of a spectrahedron is again such a projection .",
    "so together with corollary [ clos ] we get that @xmath190 is the projection of a spectrahedron . but now one checks @xmath191 which finishes the reduction step .",
    "now we ensure the existence of some finitely generated quadratic module @xmath13 in @xmath3 $ ] that contains all polynomials nonnegative on @xmath48 , with a degree bound on the sums of squares depending only on the degree of the respective polynomial",

    "now for ( i ) it is clearly enough to consider the case of a semialgebraic subset of a straight line , which is covered by kuhlmann , marshall and schwartz @xcite theorem 4.1 ( see also the paper by scheiderer @xcite ) .    for ( ii )",
    "it is enough to ensure the existence of such bounded degree representations in a quadratic module modulo the vanishing ideal @xmath192 of the respective curve . indeed ,",
    "if some polynomial @xmath144 has a representation @xmath193 with sums of squares @xmath194 and arbitrary polynomials @xmath195 , and the degree of the @xmath194 is bounded by @xmath196 , then one can find a similar representation with polynomials @xmath197 of a degree bounded by some number not depending on the specific choice of @xmath144 .",
    "this follows from the fact that an ideal intersected with a finite dimensional subspace of @xmath3 $ ] is a finite dimensional subspace , and one can choose a finite basis .",
    "so if @xmath198 belongs to that space , it is an @xmath199-linear combination of these finitely many basis elements .",

    "so it is the projection of a spectrahedron .",

    "if @xmath220 then @xmath221 so by the convex hull result from helton and nie @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and theorem [ clos ] it is enough to prove the theorem for the first orthant @xmath222 in @xmath217 .    every quadratic form in @xmath212 variables that is nonnegative on the first orthant belongs to the quadratic module generated by the pairwise products of the variables @xmath223 .",
    "this is just a slight reformulation of the main result from diananda @xcite .",
    "but then a degree bound condition on the sums of squares is fulfilled for any such representation , since no degree cancellation can occur when adding polynomials that are nonnegative on the first orthant .",
