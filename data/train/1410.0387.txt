    "of particular interest in such studies is the surface free energy , @xmath0 , which measures the work required to create a unit area of interface , and the excess adsorption , @xmath1 , which measures the number of particles in the interfacial region relative to that in a region of equal volume in the bulk . in terms of the single - particle density profile , @xmath2 ,",

    ", we will adopt the `` edge - centered convention '' , where the coordinate of the center of a fluid sphere in contact with the wall is @xmath16 . in contract ,",
    "a number of other studies - especially many of the early works - use the `` sphere - centered '' convention with @xmath17 begin the coordinate of the center of such a sphere .",
    "these two conventions give different values of the system volume and other characteristics , but the relationship between them is easy to establish . if we denote the interfacial free energy for a system using the edge - centered and sphere - centered conventions as @xmath0 and @xmath18 , respectively , then we have @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the bulk fluid pressure .",
