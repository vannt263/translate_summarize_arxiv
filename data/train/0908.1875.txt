    "the investigation of wavepackets dynamics by semiclassical methods has practical importance for calculations of several processes involving atoms and molecules .",
    "it is also a fundamental topic in the study of the classical - quantum connection , especially for chaotic systems and for open systems , coupled to environments .",
    "the history of semiclassical methods goes back to the origins of quantum mechanics itself .",
    "one fundamental result is the so called van vleck approximation to the coordinate propagator , derived in 1928 @xcite , that can be written as @xmath0 in this expression @xmath1 is the classical action of a trajectory connecting coordinates @xmath2 to @xmath3 in the time @xmath4 , @xmath5 is an element of the tangent matrix , that controls the motion in the vicinity of this trajectory , and @xmath6 is the number of focal points ( where @xmath5 goes to zero ) along the trajectory .",
    "if more than one trajectory satisfying these boundary conditions exists , one has to sum their contributions . from this basic propagator",
    "one can compute the time evolution of arbitrary wavefunctions .    a more direct approach to calculate the time evolution of wavepackets in given by the propagator in the coherent state representation .",
    "the coherent states of the harmonic oscillator are minimum uncertainty wavepackets and define a representation involving both the coordinates and the momenta that can be readily visualized in the phase space .",
    "the coherent state propagator @xmath7 centered on @xmath8 is found at the state @xmath9 , centered on @xmath10 , after a time @xmath4 .",
    "however , the direct evaluation of the semiclassical limit of this propagator results in an expression bearing the same difficulties of the van vleck formula @xcite , namely : ( a ) the classical trajectories needed are defined by mixed initial - final boundary conditions , rendering the calculation hard , specially in multidimensional or chaotic systems and ; ( b ) the formula diverges at phase space focal points .",
    "moreover , the trajectories are complex and some of them , even satisfying the appropriate boundary conditions , lead to unphysical contributions and must be discarded @xcite .",
    "several methods have been developed to overcome these difficulties , most of them based on the idea of initial value representations ( ivr ) @xcite . among these ,",
    "the herman - kluk propagator @xcite and the method of linearized cellular dynamics developed by heller and tomsovic @xcite stands out as very accurate .",
    "more recent derivations and corrections to the basic herman - kluk formula have also provided new insight into this class of approximation @xcite .    in spite of the many difficulties involved in the calculation of the coherent state propagator with complex trajectories",
    ", this approximation turns out to be very accurate @xcite .",
    "recent work on bohmian mechanics have also employed complex trajectories , providing a new formulation leading to accurate results @xcite . in this paper",
    "we propose the construction of an initial value representation for this approximation that removes most of its problems : the mixed conditions defining the trajectories are replaced by initial conditions ; the complex trajectories are mapped into real trajectories of an associated hamiltonian ; the divergences due to focal points are eliminated and ; a simple and automatic filtering is used to eliminate the non - contributing trajectories .",
    "this paper is organized as follow .",
    "the next section reviews the semiclassical coherent state propagator and its semiclassical approximation in terms of complex trajectories . in section [ sec_civr ]",
    "we develop the initial value representation for complex trajectories ( civr ) .",
    "it presents what we call the sudden civr , where only trajectories satisfying the original mixed conditions are considered , and the smooth civr where the neighborhood of the relevant trajectories are considered as well .",
    "we also discuss how the complex trajectories calculations are performed in terms of real trajectories .",
    "this section ends with a discussion of the criteria used for filtering out the non - contributing trajectories . in section [ sec_ex ] the smooth civr",
    "is applied to an anharmonic quartic oscillator and some final comments are made . in two appendices useful relations of the tangent matrix",
    "are derived for both real and complex trajectories .",
    "the coherent state @xmath11 of a harmonic oscillator of mass @xmath12 and frequency @xmath13 is defined by @xmath14 with @xmath15 the harmonic oscillator ground state and @xmath16 in these equations @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are operators ; @xmath20 and @xmath21 are real numbers and @xmath22 is complex . the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 define the length and momentum scales , respectively , and their product is @xmath25 .",
    "for a time - independent hamiltonian operator @xmath26 , the propagator in the coherent states representation is the matrix element of the evolution operator between states @xmath27 and @xmath9 @xcite : @xmath28 the semiclassical evaluation of @xmath29 was presented in detail in @xcite .",
    "the result is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31            - \\frac{i \\hbar}{2 } ( u(t)z_f^ * + z_0 v(0 ) ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the action and the classical hamiltonian function is calculated from the hamiltonian operator as @xmath32 . the term @xmath33 is a correction to the action .",
    "the sum over @xmath34 represents the sum over all contributing ( complex ) classical trajectories satisfying hamilton s equations with boundary conditions @xmath35 in all these expressions the variables @xmath36 and @xmath37 are defined by @xmath38 they are manifestly independent ( @xmath39 since @xmath20 and @xmath21 are complex ) , and replace @xmath22 and @xmath40 to avoid confusion . in these variables",
    "the boundary conditions become @xmath41",
    "the first of the boundary conditions ( [ bound ] ) specifying the complex trajectory can be written explicitly as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 define the initial coherent state @xmath45 .",
    "this condition is not sufficient to determine the trajectory , since @xmath46 and @xmath47 are complex .",
    "the missing condition is given by the second equation in ( [ bound ] ) and refers to the final propagation time @xmath4 .    in order to avoid dealing with mixed initial - final conditions , let us first suppose we have had a second equation of the form @xmath48 by solving for @xmath46 and @xmath47 one finds @xmath49    \\\\ p(0 ) & = \\frac{1}{2}(\\left[p_0+p_1 ) + i \\frac{\\hbar}{b^2}(q_1 - q_0)\\right ] .",

    "let @xmath54 and @xmath55 be the values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 such that the second of equations ( [ bound ] ) is satisfied , i.e. , for which the initial conditions ( [ civr4 ] ) leads to @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 define the final coherent state @xmath59 .",
    "then , we can rewrite the semiclassical propagator of eq .",
    "( [ scsp ] ) as @xmath60 where the trajectories are now calculated according to the initial conditions ( [ civr4 ] ) and their contributions filtered out by the delta functions .",
    "since these are sharped peaked functions , equation ( [ scspi ] ) is identical to ( [ scsp ] ) , because only the trajectories satisfying the proper boundary conditions ( [ bound ] ) are taken into account .",
    "if the delta functions are replaced by gaussian functions of width @xmath61 , fillinov type expansions become possible and a smoothed and better behaved expression arises .",
    "the equivalent expression of the semiclassical propagation for an arbitrary initial state described by the wave - function @xmath62 is @xmath63 we note that the second derivative of the action with respect to its arguments , as appearing in the pre - factor of the semiclassical propagator , can be written in terms of the tangent matrix , that controls the classical motion in the vicinity of a given trajectory . in appendix [ appa ]",
    "we derive several useful relations between the tangent matrix in @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 variables for complex and real trajectories .",
    "in particular , we show that @xmath64 before we end this subsection we define the scaled coordinates and momenta @xmath65 and @xmath66 . defining the scaled hamiltonian @xmath67 it is easy to check that the semiclassical expressions in terms of @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 become identical to the original expressions with @xmath71 and @xmath25 replaced by 1 .",
    "therefore , from now one we shall use these scaled variables , which amounts to set @xmath72 , but will omit the bar to make the notation simpler .",
    "the original variables will be recovered later in the examples .      for analytic hamiltonian functions",
    "@xmath73 it is possible to rewrite the equations of motion for the complex variables @xmath20 and @xmath21 in terms of real trajectories of an auxiliary hamiltonian system with twice as many degrees of freedom , or as we call it , the double phase space . the definitions @xcite @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are real functions , allows to show easily that hamilton s equations for @xmath20 and @xmath21 are equivalent to @xmath78 note that @xmath77 is also a constant of the motion",
    ". the separation of variables in ( [ varnew ] ) may look unusual because it mixes q s and p s , but this is the proper combination to get the correct signs in hamilton s equations .",
    "these separation of variables also look natural when the form of equation ( [ civr4 ] ) is considered .    for the case",
    "@xmath79 , the real trajectory starting from the center of the wavepacket plays an important role , and we shall use it as a reference .",
    "therefore the integration over @xmath50 and @xmath51 in the civr will be centered on @xmath43 and @xmath44 and only a limited region around this point is expected to significantly contribute to the propagation . in this way",
    "we write @xmath80 and the initial conditions ( [ civr4 ] ) reduce to @xmath81 in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ varnew ] ) , @xmath82 , @xmath83 with @xmath84 , which is exactly the variable used in a search procedure developed in ref.@xcite .",
    "all the tangent matrix elements appearing in equations ( [ smivrg ] ) and ( [ smivrag ] ) can be readily computed from the tangent matrix of the real trajectory in the double phase space .",
    "this procedure eliminates the need to work with complex trajectories and also the so called root search problem , involved in finding trajectories with mixed initial - final conditions .",
    "the connection between the initial and final displacements can be established as follow .",
    "initially by comparing equations ( [ varnew ] ) with ( [ civr4 ] ) we see that @xmath85 which also leads to @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "it turns out to be convenient to extend this definition to @xmath88    because of the filtering functions in ( [ scspi ] ) and ( [ scspig ] ) ( smoothed or sharp ) the relevant contributions to the integrals over @xmath50 and @xmath51 come from the vicinities of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , that should also be close to @xmath43 and @xmath44 . for this particular trajectory @xmath89 : @xmath90 -i [ p_1(t ) + i q_2(t ) ]",

    "for neighboring trajectories we may expand the final values of @xmath93 and @xmath94 around @xmath57 and @xmath58 as : @xmath95 or @xmath96 it follows that @xmath97 in appendix [ appb ] , equation ( [ b6 ] ) , we show that @xmath98 .      in the case of sharp delta functions we can use equation ( [ civr7 ] ) to write down the first of our formulas , that we term _ sudden _ civr .",
    "since @xmath99 and defining @xmath100 we obtain @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the phase of @xmath103 .",
    "each pair of phase space points @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 define a complex trajectory with initial conditions @xmath104 the contribution of these trajectories to the final result are filtered by the delta function .",
    "the integration measures are defined as usual as @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "notice that the arguments of @xmath107 and @xmath108 in ( [ sivr ] ) , which were originally @xmath109 , can be replaced by @xmath110 , so that both @xmath107 and @xmath108 are computed for the trajectories defined by ( [ civr4a ] ) . also important is the fact that @xmath103 in the pre - factor has moved from the denominator to the nominator so that divergences at caustics are replaced by non - contributing trajectories .",
    "this is a well known property of ivr s constructed in this way .",
    "if the delta functions in the civr are replaced by gaussian functions a more well behaved approximation is obtained .",

    "it implies that not only the trajectories satisfying the exact boundary conditions ( [ bound ] ) are considered , but also their neighborhood as defined by the parameter @xmath61 . in this case",
    "the action @xmath113 in equation ( [ scspi ] ) can not be simply replaced by @xmath114 , but has to be expanded around each initial value trajectory up to second order .",
    "the result is @xmath115 where once again we have resorted to expressions derived in appendix [ appb ] .",
    "the _ smooth _ civr can then be obtained by using equations ( [ gau ] ) and ( [ actexp ] ) in ( [ scspig ] ) : @xmath116 where @xmath117 if the initial state to be propagate is itself a coherent state , equation ( [ scspi ] ) , the smooth civr simplifies to @xmath118 with @xmath119 in this paper we shall discuss an example of this simple case only .",
    "it is well known that not all trajectories satisfying the boundary conditions ( [ bound ] ) should be included in the semiclassical propagator .",
    "the trajectories for which the real part of the exponent @xmath120 in ( [ smivrag ] ) is positive must be discarded as they give rise to divergent contributions in the semiclassical limit .",
    "these trajectories are probably associated with forbidden deformations of the integration contours that are necessary to derive the semiclassical approximation ( [ csp ] ) .",
    "for the harmonic oscillator it can be checked explicitly that not only equations ( [ smivrg ] ) and ( [ smivrag ] ) give exact results but also that @xmath121 for all complex trajectories . in our calculations trajectories satisfying @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a constant , are neglected .",
    "we discuss the importance of the cutoff value of @xmath123 in the next section .",
    "as a simple application of the smooth civr we consider the system @xmath124 it has been studied also in @xcite by directly computing the relevant complex trajectories .",
    "the parameters are set to @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 for these values the ground state energy is @xmath128 and the first two excited states have @xmath129 and @xmath130 . for the initial wavepacket",
    "we choose @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 .",

    "figure 1(c ) shows a plot of the potential function and indicates also the central trajectory energy .",
    "we momentarily restore the original un - scaled variables to illustrate both the computation of the classical hamiltonian and the scaling process .",

    "figure 1 shows five snapshots of the wavepacket ( left column ) and the corresponding regions of the @xmath146 plane where trajectories contribute significantly to the propagation . in these figures",
    "we have fixed the constant @xmath147 ( see equation ( [ cutoff ] ) ) , except for figure 1(a ) , where @xmath148 .",
    "the width @xmath61 of the smoothing gaussian was adjusted to get the best results for each propagation time , starting at @xmath149 for @xmath150 and decreasing to @xmath151 for @xmath152 ( see caption for all values ) .",
    "the integration over @xmath50 and @xmath51 was performed using a regular grid with 30 points in @xmath50 , varying from @xmath153 to @xmath154 , and 40 points in @xmath51 varying from @xmath155 to @xmath156 .",
    "the computational time for the present calculation is as fast as the split - operator method , well known for being efficient and accurate for one dimensional problems .",
    "for @xmath152 the calculations take about 3 seconds in a core 2 quad pc with 2.4ghz .",
    "the wavefunctions in figure 1 were calculated using the simple discretization @xmath157 where @xmath158 and @xmath12 represent the grid in phase - space centered on the origin .",
    "we used a total of 40 and 60 points in the @xmath20 and @xmath21 directions respectively , with @xmath159 and @xmath160 .    in spite of the accuracy of our results , specially as compared to previous calculations using root search procedures @xcite , several details remain to be understood and improved .",
    "the main problem is the sensitivity of the method to the choice of the width @xmath61 and the lack of a theory on how to choose it properly and automatically . a possible way out of this difficulty might to be the procedure devised in @xcite , where the width is chosen to minimize the oscillations of the integrand .",
    "another problem is that the propagated wavepackets turn out not to be properly normalized , and the amount by which normalization is lost also depends on the width @xmath61 . in figure 1",
    "the wave - functions have been re - normalized by hand after the propagation .    despite these problems",
    "the method improves the results obtained by direct computation of the contributing trajectories and is much faster and simple to program .",
    "the next step is an application of the method to multidimensional systems , where the integrations over the initial conditions may be performed by monte carlo techniques .",
    "the difficulties just mentioned are currently under investigation .",
    "in this appendix we use the scaled units where @xmath161 . in the @xmath36 and @xmath37 variables the tangent matrix is defined by @xmath162 where @xmath163 and @xmath164 are small displacements at the initial point of the trajectory and @xmath165 and @xmath166 are the corresponding final deviations .",
    "the action @xmath167 for the trajectory with @xmath168 and @xmath169 satisfies @xcite @xmath170 from the differentiation of ( [ a2 ] ) keeping the variable @xmath4 constant , we can obtain the connection between initial and final displacements . in matrix form it is @xmath171 where @xmath172 , etc . comparing with eq.([a1 ] ) we find @xmath173 using the definition of @xmath36 and @xmath37 in terms of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( notice that all these variables are complex ) it is easy to show that @xcite @xmath174 where @xmath12 is the tangent matrix in the @xmath20 , @xmath21 system . finally ,",
    "using the definition of the real variables @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 and defining its corresponding @xmath179 tangent matrix @xmath158 we can show that @xmath180 therefore , by working directly with the real trajectories in the double phase space we can compute @xmath158 and reconstruct the matrices @xmath12 and @xmath181 using simple linear transformations .",
    "if @xmath183 in equation ( [ eqvt ] ) is an analytic function of the initial condition @xmath184 , then , by the cauchy - riemann conditions we have @xmath185 by the definition of @xmath186 , equation ( [ civr6 ] ) , @xmath187 on the other hand we also have , @xmath188 and , therefore , @xmath189 finally , using the second of equations ( [ a2 ] ) with @xmath190 , and differentiating with respect to @xmath183 , @xmath191 which implies @xmath192 by equation ( [ a4 ] ) .",
