    "the phenomenon of high - temperature superconductivity can not be completely understood without clarification of pseudogap features seen by many experimental techniques in the normal state of underdoped cuprates .",
    "there are few informative reviews and papers devoted to this problem ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most reasonable point of view is that a pseudogap in the density of states shows up due to an instability in two - dimensional copper - oxygen planes .",
    "the important question to answer is what is the physical origin of this possible instability in layered cuprates . in a series of works di castro and co - workers(see for example @xcite ) in a frame of the phenomenological quantum critical point ( qcp ) hypotethis",
    "have suggested to explain the pseudogap as a result of the formation of the incommensurate charge density wave ( icdw ) . in recent paper",
    "the pseudogap phenomena has been considered in a context of a new hidden order parameter with orbital antiferromagnetism ( special case of d - wave wave order parameter ) @xcite .",
    "constructing the integral equation for the extended charge density waves instability in a frame t - j hamiltonian proposed by anderson @xcite it is easy to prove that for @xmath5 the order parameter for charge instability indeed has a d - wave symmetry .",
    "however , the order parameter is imaginary@xcite and , therefore , is not a usual charge density waves .",
    "this reminds the old problem of the itinerant currents studied many years ago in semiconductors @xcite .",
    "perhaps , the most convincing evidence about the instability in layered cuprates can be obtained directly within the analysis of the dynamical charge and spin susceptibilities .",
    "in contrast to the spin susceptibility the role played by the instabilities in the charge channel with respect to the pairing and pseudogap formation are not clear .",
    "moreover , the form of the charge susceptibility beyond rpa scheme was much less investigated .",
    "in particular , there are no agreement about its analytical form if the effect of strong electron correlations is taken into account ( for example , compare the results in refs .",
    "@xcite . therefore , the theoretical investigation in this direction becomes very actual .    here",
    ", using the singlet - correlated band model ( @xcite and references therein ) which under simplified assumption about energy dispersion and screened coulomb repulsion is equivalent to the @xmath6 model @xcite using the projecting hubbard - like operators @xcite we derive the expression for the dynamical charge susceptibility beyond rpa - scheme .",
    "we analyze the obtained expression numerically and find that the charge susceptibility shows a peak at * q * = ( @xmath1 , @xmath1 ) similarly to a spin susceptibility only if one takes into account the strong enough inter - site coulomb repulsion . investigating the denominator of the charge susceptibility we have found the possible dispersion curve of cdw - like excitations @xmath7 , for optimally doped cuprates .",
    "the hamiltonian in the singlet - correlated band model in terms of hubbard - type projecting operators , @xmath8 reads as @xmath9 + \\sum g_{ij}\\delta _ i\\delta_{j } \\\\\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is a hopping integral and @xmath11 is the superexchange constant of the copper spins , @xmath12 .",
    "symbol @xmath13-corresponds to a zhang - rice singlet where one hole is placed on copper and second distributed on neighboring oxygen sites @xcite and carrying spin states , respectively .",
    "@xmath14 is a screened inter - site coulomb repulsion of the doped holes .",
    "@xmath15 is equation that determines the chemical potential .",
    "the @xmath16 operators obey the specific commutation relation and on - site multiplication rules of hubbard - like operators which can be found somewhere @xcite .",
    "the spin and density operators are expressed by projecting operators as follows @xmath17 let us now make some preliminary discussion about the nature of density wave formation in a frame of our model .",
    "we are going to study the objects which can be described by the following operators @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are charge- and spin - excitation amplitudes , respectively .",
    "the frequencies of the harmonic motion of these objects can be found in a usual manner @xmath22 real part of @xmath23 corresponds to usual charge density waves ( cdw ) order parameter whereas its imaginary part is responsible for the charge current ( jc ) formation @xcite .",
    "the latter also looks very similar to the proposed earlier flux phase @xcite and orbital antiferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "real part of @xmath24 represents the well - known spin density waves ( sdw ) and its imaginary quantity closely related to the so - called spin current ( js ) formation @xcite .",
    "symmetry aspects of these interesting problem has been discussed very recently by nayak @xcite and therefore we do not touch this problem here .",
    "one could immediately see from ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) that the equations for the frequency determination of the real and imaginary parts looks very similar and seem to be a good starting point to study both the collective charge and the spin excitations in layered cuprates",
    ".    calculating the commutators using the simplest hubbard1 decoupling scheme@xcite ( for details see the next section ) one can find that @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be taken in a usual form : @xmath27 and frequencies are determined by the relations @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a partion number , @xmath31 is an energy dispersion of the itinerant carriers , @xmath32 is hubbard - type bandwidth narrowing factor .",
    "the fourier transform of the integrals @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are determined by the usual expressions @xmath36 where @xmath37(@xmath38 , @xmath39 ) , @xmath40(@xmath41 , @xmath42 ) , and @xmath43 refer to the first , second , and third neighbors respectively .",
    "for simplicity we put the lattice constant equals unity .",
    "the choice of parameters for the hopping integrals is determined by the right fermi surface topology and presence of van - hove singularity in the vicinity of the fermi level as observed in the experiment @xcite .",
    "this satisfies at @xmath37 = 72 mev , @xmath40 = 0 , and @xmath43 = 12 mev .",
    "the screened coulomb repulsion of the doped holes and superexchange integral between nearest copper spins were taken as @xmath44 = 70 mev and @xmath38 = 135 mev in agreement with first principles calculation@xcite and inelastic neutron scattering experiments @xcite respectively .",
    "regarding eqs .",
    "( [ ocdw ] ) and ( [ osdw ] ) we would like to remark two important features .",
    "both equations determine the conditions of the instability of the system with respect to mentioned types of charge and spin instabilities .",
    "in other words eqs .",
    "( [ ocdw ] ) and ( [ osdw ] ) determine the divergences of charge and spin susceptibilities in the normal state .",
    "in contrast to the usual rpa - type of expression the first terms in ( [ ocdw ] ) and ( [ osdw ] ) proportional to the hopping integral result from the strong electron correlation effects due to no double on - site occupancy constraint@xcite .",
    "it reflects the existence of very large on - site coulomb repulsion leading to a renormalization and enhancement of the susceptibilities ( or in other words the presence of strong electron correlation ) .",
    "this non - fermi liquid correction was firstly deduced by hubbard and jain@xcite for the spin susceptibility .",
    "the second remark is that as one can see from eqs .",
    "( [ ocdw ] ) and ( [ osdw ] ) the screened inter - site coulomb repulsion plays no role for the determining of spin dispersion in contrast to charge one .",
    "therefore it becomes clear that the equations for charge and spin collective excitation are quite different in presence of inter - site coulomb interaction than it was widely implied .",
    "however , our present approach is quite preliminary and in order to see the difference between charge and spin collective excitations more in details we will calculate dynamical charge susceptibility and compare its form with spin counterpart obtained earlier@xcite .",
    "we start from the definition of the fourier transform of the amplitude of the density operator @xmath45 where the fourier transform defined as @xmath46 in the next step we derive the equation of motion for the two retarded green s functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 we calculate the commutators using the on - site representation of the operators .",
    "for example for the kinetic part of the hamiltonian @xmath49 , it has a form @xmath50 this exact result leads , however , to the appearance of green s function of higher order .",
    "therefore we made the decoupling in the few steps .",
    "first , using the equation for the determining of the chemical potential and definitions of the density and spin operators determined in previous section one can find @xmath51 where @xmath52 is an average number of the doped holes per one unit cell and @xmath53 its modulation .",
    "the next step is to differ the cases @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in latter the right hand side of ( [ commut ] )",
    "can be approximated within the usual approximation technique @xmath56 where @xmath57 is zero in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "as for the case @xmath54 it can be calculated exactly as @xmath58 using the fourier transformation ( [ furcdw1 ] ) we can write the commutator ( [ commut ] ) in the equation of motion as follows @xmath59 the last term in ( [ q ] ) still leads to the high order green s function but hopefully it can be reduced to the old one with the help of ( [ i = j ] ) , which yields @xmath60 and @xmath61 , we notice that operator @xmath62 commutes with these terms of the hamiltonian and therefore @xmath54 case does not contribute to the equation of motion .",
    "this is in contrast to the spin susceptibility where the additional non - commutation of spin operator @xmath63 led to the fact that ordinary hubbard1 decoupling scheme is not enough and additional consideration is required @xcite . strictly speaking it means that although spin and charge degrees of freedom are still coupled as in the case of the usual fermi - liquid , however , the simple relations of rpa - approximation of the usual fermi liquid approach do not hold .",
    "for the case of @xmath55 in site representation we have @xmath64 whereas for the case @xmath54 @xmath65 restricting ourself an absence of long range spin order we can wright @xmath66 for the coulomb screening part of the hamiltonian the result reads @xmath67 substituting ( [ q],[hjj],[hgg ] ) into the equation of motion ( [ greenf ] ) and taking into account the absence of the external magnetic field we get finally @xmath68 where @xmath69 . performing a sum over * k *",
    "we obtain the expression for the dynamical charge susceptibility in a form @xmath70 where @xmath71 is an ordinary pauli - lindhard response function @xmath72 the most interesting @xmath73 and @xmath74 terms describe the contributions due to no - double occupancy constraint and projecting nature of hubbard operators : @xmath75 @xmath76 the comparison of the obtained equation with our preliminary consideration resulting in eq .",
    "( [ ocdw ] ) shows that important @xmath77 term has been appeared on the right hand side of ( [ zq ] ) . to our knowledge",
    "this term was not pointed out for the charge susceptibility so far .",
    "it acts as a frequency dependent `` molecular field '' caused by the transfer hopping term of the hamiltonian ( [ hubbard ] ) .",
    "let us first analyze the behavior of the obtained expression for the dynamical charge susceptibility ( [ cds ] ) . in fig .",
    "1 we present the calculated re @xmath78 for the set of parameters described above .",
    "the peak around ( @xmath1 , @xmath1 ) reflects the nesting properties of the fermi surface enhanced by the rpa - type of the denominator .",
    "the structure of real part of the charge susceptibility at zero frequency looks very similar to the spin counterpart .",
    "originally it comes from the nesting properties of the fermi surface resembles by @xmath79 .",
    "however , the additional enhancement due to the denominator is quite different origin in both cases . in the spin susceptibility it results due to superexchange interaction having a maximum at ( @xmath1 , @xmath1 ) . in the charge susceptibility",
    "the contribution from @xmath34 has a different sign and therefore should suppress the peak . on the other hand inclusion of the inter - site coulomb screening repairs the situation and again leads to the strong commensurate peak around ( @xmath1 , @xmath1 ) .",
    "as we will see later this peak is strongly dependent only on the value of inter - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "this is quite remarkable fact if one remembers that for example the calculations of the charge and spin susceptibility in the frame of one - band hubbard hamiltonian with on - site @xmath80 or ordinary @xmath6 model show that charge susceptibility is    rather small at q=(@xmath1 , @xmath1 ) in contrast to the spin susceptibility@xcite .",
    "this often led to the exclusion of the charge degrees of freedom from the pairing interaction .",
    "however , as it is seen here the significant contribution to the charge susceptibility comes from the inter - site screened coulomb repulsion between doped holes .",
    "since this interaction plays the most important role in underdoped case one would expect the significant contribution to the pairing interaction from the charge susceptibility too .    this fact is also seen from fig . 2 where we present the imaginary part of the charge susceptibility at q=(@xmath1,@xmath1 ) with and without screened coulomb repulsion @xmath44 .",
    "without inter - site coulomb repulsion one sees that charge susceptibility shows no features at low energies .",
    "this indicates that superexchange mechanism itself can not lead to any charge instabilities in the system .",
    "the situations changes drastically if one switches on the screened coulomb repulsion between doped holes . at",
    "@xmath44 = 70 mev charge susceptibility shows a strong peak at @xmath81 = 15 mev .",
    "this is quite comparable with typical spin fluctuation frequency , @xmath82 that results from the approximate position of the    peak in i m @xmath83 , @xmath82 and which is also in order of 15 mev in layered cuprates@xcite .",
    "on the basis of figs . 1 and 2 we can conclude that charge susceptibility may play an important role in the scattering mechanism and in the cooper pairing instability correspondingly .",
    "however , such a large value of inter - site coulomb interaction one could expect only at low doping level .",
    "therefore , we think that the spin fluctuation scenario of superconductivity is much more robust than charge fluctuation one in high - t@xmath84 cuprates .",
    "one would expect , however , a strong charge density wave like instability in underdoped cuprates since inter - site coulomb repulsion is the most important at low doping concentration .    in order to analyze these possible instabilities in the charge subsystem",
    "we also investigate the charge susceptibility with respect to a cdw formation .",
    "the cdw frequencies range can be obtained analyzing the denominator of dynamical charge susceptibility expression ( [ cds ] ) .",
    "therefore , we solve the equation @xmath85 through the route of the brillouin zone @xmath86 .",
    "one has to notice , however , that the solution of eq .",
    "( [ zqw ] ) can only be obtained at larger than 70 mev values of inter - site coulomb repulsion . in particular , at the optimal doping , @xmath87 @xmath88 , the stable solution in the whole brilloune zone was found only at g@xmath89 = 150 mev . in fig.3",
    "we present the resulting energy dispersion of cdw frequency , @xmath90 at temperature t=100 k. as one can see there are three disconnected branches of the frequency curves .",
    "it happens due to the fact that instability occurs not along the whole brllouin zone but rather at some critical wave vectors .",
    "in particular , it is clearly seen that the charge system is very unstable near the incommensurate wave vector ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 ) where curve is crossing zero .",
    "this means that the possible cdw must occur at this incommensurate wave vector @xmath93 .",
    "this quite a remarkable result confirms the difference between paramagnon charge fluctuations which are commensurate and real cdw order parameter having incommensurate wave vector .",
    "in a conclusion we have obtained in a frame of singlet - correlated band model beyond rpa approximation the new analytical expression for the dynamical charge sucseptibility .",
    "we have shown that it produce a strong peak at * q * = ( @xmath1 , @xmath1 ) at large enough screened coulomb repulsion between doped holes .",
    "this may result in a significant contribution to the pairing interaction from the charge susceptibility at low doping level where coulomb repulsion plays an important role .",
    "the analysis of the instability of the system with respect to a cdw formation shows that the system is the most unstable at the incommensurate wave vector * q*@xmath94 ( @xmath92 , @xmath92 ) .",
