    "the assumption of self - interest as a motivation for social and economic behavior is widely used as a guiding principle for social modeling . in a game theory context the idea of maximization of self - interest leads to the notion of ( noncooperative ) nash equilibrium .",
    "a strategy is a nash equilibrium if no player can improve his payoff by changing his strategy , when the strategies of the other players are fixed .",
    "given any environment situation , in a nash equilibrium solution , each player tries to maximize his gains regardless of what happens to the other players .",
    "it is the rational expectations attitude of what has been called the _ homo oeconomicus , _ a notion which is at the basis of many theoretical economics constructions .",
    "whether this is a realistic notion when applied to human societies is an important issue .",
    "experiments have been carried out and , in many cases , when played by human players , games have outcomes very different from the nash equilibrium points .",
    "an interesting case is the _ _ ultimatum game__@xcite .",
    "a simplified version of this game is the following :    one of the players ( the _ proposer _",
    "@xmath0 ) receives 100 coins which he is told to divide into two non - zero parts , one for himself and the other for the other player ( the _ responder _ @xmath1 ) .",
    "if the responder accepts the split @xmath2 , it is implemented .",
    "if the responder refuses @xmath3 , nothing is given to the players .",
    "consider , for example , a simple payoff matrix corresponding to two different proposer offers @xmath4 @xmath5 with @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( for example @xmath8 ) .",
    "the unique nash equilibrium is @xmath9 , corresponding to the payoffs @xmath10 .",
    "however , when the game is played with human players , such greedy proposals are most often refused , even in one - shot games where the responder has no material or strategic advantage in refusing the offer . based on this and similar results in other situations ( public goods games , etc ) , bowles and gintis@xcite @xcite developed the notion of strong reciprocity ( _ _ homo reciprocans__@xcite ) as a better model for human behavior .",
    "_ homo reciprocans would come to social situations with a propensity to cooperate and share but would respond to selfish behavior on the part of others by retaliating , even at a cost to himself and even when he could not expect any future personal gains from such actions_. this should be distinguished from cooperation in a repeated game or reciprocal altruism or other forms of mutually beneficial cooperation that can be accounted for in terms of self - interest .",
    "the same authors , in collaboration with a group of anthropologists , conducted a very interesting `` ultimatum game experiment '' in many small - scale societies around the world@xcite .",
    "homo oeconomicus is rejected in all cases and consistently different results are obtained in different societies , the players behavior being strongly correlated with existing social norms and the market structure in their societies .",
    "this and other experiments @xcite @xcite strongly suggest that human decision problems involve a mixture of self - interest and a background of ( internalized ) social norms @xcite @xcite .    strong reciprocity is a form of altruism @xcite in that it benefits others at the expense of the individual that exhibits this trait .",
    "monitoring and punishing selfish agents or norm violators is a costly ( and dangerous ) activity without immediate direct benefit to the agent that performs it",
    ". it would be much better to let others do it and to reap the social benefits without the costs .",
    "strong reciprocator agents contribute more to the group than selfish ones and they sustain the cost of monitoring and punishing free - riders . for this reason",
    "it was thought that the strong reciprocity trait could not invade a population of self - interested agents , nor could it be maintained in a stable population equilibrium . to counter this belief ,",
    "bowles and gintis @xcite developed a simple ( mean - field type ) model that might apply to the structure of the small hunter - gatherer bands of the late pleistocene .",
    "taking the view that the _ strong reciprocity _",
    "trait has a genetic basis , this would be a period long enough to account for a significant development in the modern human gene distribution .",
    "the model would give an evolutionary explanation of the phenomenon .",
    "of course , if instead of gene - based , strong reciprocity is culturally inherited , emergence and ( or ) modification of this trait could be much faster .    because i intend to explore the influence of the social ( network ) structure on the evolution of strong reciprocity , i will start by discussing a simplified version of the bowles - gintis model .",
    "the main simplification is that migration in and out of the evolving group to an outside pool of agents is not considered .",
    "the consideration of these migrations may be of interest for a realistic picture of the hunter - gatherer bands of the pleistocene , but not for the general picture of strong reciprocity in a wider society . by simplifying and somewhat enlarging the punishment scenario ( beyond ostracism ) of the bowles - gintis model and framing it as a replicator one - dimensional map",
    ", a clear view is obtained of its dynamical aspects .",
    "one considers a population of size @xmath11 with two species of agents , one denoted",
    "_ reciprocators _",
    "( r - agents ) and the other _ self - interested _ ( s - agents ) . in a _ public goods _ activity each agent can produce a maximum amount of goods @xmath12 at cost @xmath13 ( with goods and costs in fitness units ) .",
    "the benefit that an s - agent takes from shirking public goods work is the cost of effort @xmath14 , @xmath15 being the fraction of time the agent shirks .",
    "the following conditions hold @xmath16 furthermore @xmath17 so that , at every level of effort , working helps the group more than it hurts the worker .    for @xmath14",
    "one chooses @xmath18 which satisfies the constraints ( [ 2.1 ] ) .",
    "r - agents never shirk and punish each free - rider at cost @xmath19 , the cost being shared by all r - agents . for an s - agent the estimated cost of being punished is @xmath20 , punishment being ostracism or some other fitness decreasing measure .",
    "@xmath21 is the weight given by an s - agent to the punishment probability .",
    "it may or may not be the same as the actual fitness cost of punishment .",
    "each s - agent chooses @xmath15 ( the shirking time fraction ) to minimize the function @xmath22 @xmath23 being the fraction of r - agents in the population , @xmath24 is the probability of being monitored and punished .",
    "the last term is the agent s share of his own production .",
    "the value @xmath25 that minimizes @xmath26 is @xmath27    the contribution of each species to the population in the next time period is proportional to its fitness given by @xmath28 for s- and r - agents .",
    "the baseline fitness is zero , that is , @xmath29 .",
    "the first term in both @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the benefit arising from the produced public goods and the second term the work effort .",
    "the last terms represent the fitness cost of punishment for s - agents and the cost incurred by r - agents .",
    "@xmath32 corresponds to ostracism from the group , other values to general coercive measures affecting the fitness of s - agents .",
    "the last term in @xmath33 emphasizes the collective nature of the punishment .",
    "notice however the improbable heavy punishing burden put on reciprocators when in small number .",
    "finally one obtains a one - dimensional map for the evolution of the fraction of r - agents @xmath34    figs . 1 and 2 display this map , as well as @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 for two different values of @xmath38 , the other parameters being the same .",
    "they show the general behavior of the map in eq.([2.6 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath39 ( the fitness impact of punishment ) is large enough , the map has an unstable fixed point @xmath40 at @xmath41 and a left - stable one @xmath42 at @xmath43 . between @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    "there is a continuum of marginally stable fixed points . for smaller @xmath38 the region between @xmath41 and @xmath43 ( where @xmath45 is negative ) disappears and only the marginally stable fixed points remain . in both cases",
    "the asymptotic behavior corresponds either to @xmath46 ( and @xmath47 ) or to @xmath23 between @xmath48 and @xmath44 but @xmath49 . that is , in this second case , both reciprocators and shirkers remain in the population but shirkers choose not to shirk because the minimum of @xmath50 is at @xmath51 .",
    "for an initial @xmath23 smaller than @xmath41 the fraction of reciprocators falls very rapidly to zero .",
    "this reflects the ( maybe unrealistic ) fact that in this case a very small number of reciprocators has to carry the burden of punishing very many shirkers .",
    "hence , from the point of view of intragroup dynamics , either reciprocators are completely eliminated from the population or they remain in equilibrium with a probably large number of shirkers , which do not shirk for fear of being punished . therefore intragroup dynamics , by itself , can not explain how the reciprocator attitude might have become a dominant trait .",
    "however when very many groups are considered , for example assembled at random from a pool containing both reciprocators and shirkers @xcite @xcite , then only the groups that contain at the start a fraction @xmath23 greater than @xmath41 will have in the end a nonzero fitness . in all others ,",
    "s - agents invade the population and suffer a `` tragedy of the commons '' situation with final zero fitness . therefore from an intergroup dynamics perspective the groups with reciprocators tend to dominate and impose an above average predominance of the reciprocator trait .",
    "although the model , together with intergroup dynamics , explains why strong reciprocity is an adaptive trait @xcite , the marginally stable nature of the ( above @xmath43 ) fixed points also suggest that the shirker trait is never eliminated and will remain in the population .",
    "small independent groups assembling and disassembling is a likely scenario for the development of the reciprocator trait . in this sense",
    "the hunter - gatherer bands of the pleistocene might have indeed provided the appropriate environment for the evolution of the trait , whether gene - coded or culturally - inherited .",
    "it is well known that group size affects monitoring in public goods provision @xcite .",
    "therefore , a natural question is what happens when , later on , the pleistocene reciprocators and their fellow shirkers become imbedded into a larger society .",
    "monitoring and punishment of shirkers by reciprocators necessarily looses its global collective nature . once monitoring looses its global nature",
    ", it becomes the business of the neighbors of the shirker .",
    "in addition to the individual cost of monitoring and ( or ) punishing free - riders , such punishing requires an amount of force that , in particular , insures the effectiveness of the punishment and on the other hand puts the punisher safe from direct retaliation from the violator .",
    "this is one of the reasons for the creation of central authorities for this purpose .",
    "however if central authorities have enough force to implement punishment without retaliation , they are at times quite ineffective at monitoring .",
    "also laws and central authorities , on the role of reciprocators play , a role in the control of serious offenses , but not so much on the day to day monitoring of public goods work . therefore in a large society",
    "the nature of the control performed by the neighbors is certainly going to play a role on the evolution of the reciprocator trait .    if the trait is genetically encoded , maybe the wider societies developed by modern man had no time to make significant changes on its structure . however",
    "if it is ( at least in part ) culturally inherited then a much shorter time scale may be involved .",
    "what about the big city tales of a guy being mugged in full daylight while a crowd of passersby moves along quite indifferent to the event ?",
    "is it the ( @xmath52 ) remnants of non - reciprocators in the population or are we watching the emergence of homo oeconomicus in his full glory ? or is it something else ?",
    "to explore the possible effect of the social network structure on the evolution of strong reciprocity i will consider a agent - based model , which later on will be interpreted in a mean field sense similar to the model in section 2 .",
    "as before one considers r - agents and s - agents and the monitoring function performed by r - agents is kept at the neighbors level .",
    "however punishment is only implemented if at least two neighbors are willing to do so .",
    "it is the same as to say that punishing a norm - violator can not be an individual action , but requires a minimal social power and consensus .",
    "the need to be close to monitor and the need for agreement of at least two neighboring reciprocators to implement punishment , immediately suggests that the structure of the network is going to play a role on the evolution of the group .",
    "the following is the mathematical coding of this idea :    as before one has two agent species ( s - agents and r - agents ) , the fraction of r - agents being @xmath23 .",
    "the agents are placed in a network where , on average , each agent is connected to @xmath53 other agents .",
    "@xmath53 is called the _ degree _ of the network . to the whole population of dimension @xmath11",
    "one associates 3 @xmath54dimensional vectors , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath55 is called the _ _  work vector , _ _ @xmath56 the _ punishment vector _ and @xmath57 the _ cost of punishment vector_.    the link structure of the network is chosen as in the @xmath58model of watts and strogatz@xcite @xcite . starting from a regular ring structure where each node is symmetrically connected to its @xmath53 closest neighbors , each link is examined in turn and , with probability @xmath59 , replaced by a random link to some other node in the network .    at time zero , @xmath60 r - agents and @xmath61 s - agents are placed at random in the network . the local neighborhood of agent @xmath62 , that is the set of other agents connected to @xmath62 , is denoted @xmath63 .",
    "the entries of the vectors @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 are then computed as follows :    # for the @xmath55 vector    r - agents ; @xmath64    s - agents ; @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the number of r - agents connected to this s - agent , @xmath67    # for the @xmath56 vector    r - agents ; @xmath68    s - agents ;  @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the number of pairs of r - agents in @xmath63 which are also neighbors among themselves , @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the shirking fraction .",
    "# for the @xmath57 vector    r - agents ; @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the number of times that the agent @xmath62 is in a r - pair punishing an s - agent @xmath53 , @xmath75    s - agents ; @xmath76    summarizing :    each reciprocator , on detecting an s - agent @xmath53 , looks for another reciprocator in his own neighborhood also connected to @xmath53 .",
    "if he finds one he punishes @xmath53 by an amount proportional to the fraction of shirking .",
    "an s - agent may be punished several times by all different pairs of reciprocators in his neighborhood .",
    "the amount of work that an s - agent does is inversely proportional to the number of reciprocators in his neighborhood .",
    "however lack of communication between neighboring reciprocators may make the probability of punishment much smaller .",
    "the ( average ) fitness of r - agents and s - agents is @xmath77 @xmath78 the baseline fitness is zero , that is @xmath79 once the fitness is computed the replicator equation @xmath80 is applied and a new cycle starts with a new random distribution , on the network , of @xmath81 r - agents and @xmath82 s - agents .    running this agent model for several values of @xmath59 and , in each case ,",
    "for random initial @xmath83 s one finds two separate regions in the @xmath84 plane ( fig.3 ) . in region 1",
    "the evolution drives @xmath23 towards zero as well as the overall fitness @xmath85 ( example in fig.4a )    @xmath86    in region 2 there is an asymptotic nonzero value for @xmath23 and for the fitness ( example in fig.4b ) .",
    "as @xmath59 increases it becomes less likely to have a stable nonzero @xmath23 .",
    "the origin of this effect is clear .",
    "although @xmath58rewiring maintains the average degree of the network , the probability of two neighbors of an agent to be themselves neighbors decreases .",
    "therefore it becomes increasingly difficult for reciprocators to find local consensus for the punishment of s - agents .",
    "the average probability of two r - neighbors of a network node in s to be themselves neighbors , is called the ( relative ) _ clustering coefficient _ , @xmath87 @xmath88 being the maximum possible number of links between the r - neighbors of s - agent @xmath62 .",
    "the network clustering coefficient is related to the notion of transitivity used in the sociological literature .",
    "for the @xmath58rewiring model , the clustering may be estimated from the number @xmath89 of shortcuts which in this case is proportional to @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "@xmath90 therefore a mean field version of the agent model may be written as follows @xmath91 @xmath92 notice the term @xmath93 in @xmath94 and in the cost of punishment term in @xmath95 .",
    "it reflects the fact that neighborhood relations for reciprocators are to computed on their subnetwork of size @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath14 is as in eq.([2.2 ] ) with @xmath25 being computed to minimize @xmath96    this mean field version gives results identical to the agent - based model .",
    "clustering appears therefore as the determining network parameter driving the evolution of the reciprocator trait .",
    "1 - with a structure of small groups with collective monitoring of the agents activities , the fitness difference between groups with a sizable amount of reciprocators and those where they have disappeared , makes the emergence of the strong reciprocity trait a likely event .",
    "however rather than being completely invaded by reciprocators , maintenance of a certain amount of self - interested types is also likely , which only cooperate for fear of being punished .",
    "if , at a later stage , the social structure changes , they may be a source of instability and invade the population .    2 - in a large population , monitoring of the public goods behavior of the agents can not be a fully collective activity , rather being the chore of those in close contact with the free - riders .",
    "punishment of free - riders also requires a certain amount of local consensus among reciprocators .",
    "therefore the clustering nature of the society may play an important role in the maintenance and evolution of the reciprocator trait .    maybe the indifferent passersby that let the poor guy be mugged are not yet homo oeconomicus",
    ". maybe they are just reciprocators in the middle of strangers with whom they do not communicate nor trust . a clustering problem .",
    "3 - culturally - inherited traits may have a much faster dynamics than gene - based ones .",
    "modern societies are `` small worlds '' in the sense of short path lengths but not necessarily in the sense of also maintaining a high degree of clustering .",
    "therefore if the reciprocator trait has a high cultural component , it may very well happen that , eventually , we will see homo oeconomicus leaving the benches of economy classes for a life on the streets .",
