    "a star closely orbiting a black hole may be disrupted by a tidal force , most likely resulting in highly luminous flares .",
    "observation of such flares can thus provide important clues to the physics of black holes ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "the high luminosity phase is of short duration , making detection rare , but recent x - ray observations@xcite suggest a declining phase after the tidal disruption in a non - active galactic nucleus .",
    "a numerical simulation of tidal disruption and subsequent dynamical evolution has been carried out using smoothed particle hydrodynamics @xcite , in which the typical velocity of the fluid elements was mildly relativistic , less than 0.1@xmath4 .",
    "recently , chicone and mashhoon @xcite pointed out a very interesting phenomenon of tidal forces .",
    "when an ultra - relativistic velocity is considered , the tidal force exhibits an unexpected property contrary to non - relativistic dynamics .",
    "suppose that an object of finite size falls towards a black hole along the @xmath0 axis .",
    "the object would be stretched along the @xmath0 axis and compressed along the @xmath1 and @xmath2 axes under the newtonian tidal force .",
    "the tidal force would therefore cause anisotropic acceleration and deceleration in the particle dynamics near a freely - falling observer .",
    "that is , from the viewpoint of the observer , out - going particles on the @xmath0 axis would accelerate , while out - going particles on the @xmath1 or @xmath2 axes would decelerate .",
    "this is a non - relativistic expectation .",
    "chicone and mashhoon however showed that when the particle velocity exceeds a critical value @xmath5 , the particles would decelerate along the @xmath0 axis , but accelerate along the @xmath1 or @xmath2 axes .",
    "chicone , mashhoon and punsly @xcite also discussed the case of a spinning particle orbiting a rotating black hole . in their one - dimensional model",
    ", the relativistic particles instantaneously escape from a valid region of the local observer frame .    here , we present another concrete model of the tidal effects on relativistic motion . we consider motion of a charged particle in a weak magnetic field , and schwarzschild metric .",
    "fermi normal coordinates are constructed around the reference observer falling into a black hole .",
    "the magnetic field is assumed to be uniform along the @xmath0 axis in this frame .",
    "far from the gravitational source where the tidal force is negligible , the orbit is circular in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane . as the reference frame approaches the black hole along the @xmath0 axis , the tidal force becomes important .",
    "but how does it disturb the circular motion ?",
    "in particular , how does the relativistic rotating velocity affect the result ?",
    "the spatial orbit of the particle is always bound , so that it is possible to pursue the long term evolution in the fermi system .",
    "this toy problem may deepen our understanding of the tidal force .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the equation of motion of a charged particle in fermi coordinates is discussed . in section 3 , the tidal effect in the non - relativistic limit is discussed . in section 4 ,",
    "motion with relativistic velocity is considered , and numerical results are given .",
    "section 5 is the discussion .",
    "we consider a reference observer whose world line is geodesic .",
    "fermi normal coordinates , @xmath6 in a neighborhood of the observer can be constructed such that the world line of the observer is given by the observer s proper time @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the metric accurate to second order in @xmath9 takes the form@xcite : @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 are components of the riemann tensor along the observer .",
    "we consider the dynamics of a particle with mass @xmath14 and charge @xmath15 , labeled @xmath16 or @xmath17 in the fermi system .",
    "the equations of motion for the charged particle subject to the lorentz force are @xcite @xmath18 where the overdots denote differentiation with respect to time @xmath19 , and @xmath20 @xmath21 in eq.([maxwell ] ) , @xmath22 is the faraday - maxwell tensor and @xmath23 is the four velocity of the charged particle .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the electric field is zero and that the magnetic field is constant along the @xmath0 direction in the reference observer system .",
    "for motion of a particle in a uniform magnetic field @xmath24 , the electromagnetic acceleration ( [ maxwell ] ) is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "using an explicit form of the riemann tensor in schwarzschild spacetime , eq.([mster ] ) can be reduced to @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the schwarzschild radius , @xmath32 the gravitational constant and @xmath33 the mass . for a freely falling body with zero radial velocity at infinity",
    ", @xmath34 can be expressed as a function of proper time @xmath35 of the reference observer : @xmath36 , and therefore @xmath37 .",
    "we consider only the negative region of time @xmath35 , in which @xmath38 corresponds to @xmath39 , and @xmath40 corresponds to @xmath41 .",
    "however , when the spatial range is limited , time is also limited , e.g , when the spatial range is limited to @xmath42 , time is limited to @xmath43 .    equation ( [ eqz ] ) shows that if the particle is initially moving on a @xmath44 plane , ( i.e. @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) , the particle always remains on the plane . from now on ,",
    "we ignore motion in the @xmath0 direction .",
    "in this section , we consider the non - relativistic limit of eqs.([eqx ] ) and ( [ eqy ] ) , and assume flat spacetime .",

    "the tidal force dominates over the lorentz force for small @xmath31 , i.e , small @xmath55 , and the condition of the tidal disruption can be approximated as @xmath86 .",
    "after the transition time @xmath79 , the velocity increases . the curves in figure 2 are only shown for values of @xmath87 up to @xmath88 , but actually diverge as @xmath89 in the limit of @xmath90 .",
    "the non - relativistic treatment therefore becomes invalid , and the special relativistic effects should be taken in account in the final phase .",
    "in this section , we consider the tidal effect on gyration of a relativistic charged particle .",
    "we neglect electro - magnetic radiation from the particle for simplicity . the tidal acceleration is described in fermi normal coordinates constructed around a reference observer .",
    "the spatial range valid for the coordinate system is limited by radius @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is a typical component of curvature tensor evaluated along the observer s world line .",
    "a simple criterion is @xmath93 outside this region , the spatial metric in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane changes sign .",
    "we assume that the center of the circular motion is located not far from the reference observer at the origin , i.e , @xmath94 .",
    "it is possible to realize @xmath95 , but the location of the reference observer is inadequate in such a case . in the non - relativistic approximation , circular velocity @xmath96 in the absence of the tidal force satisfies the relation @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , the location of the circular motion may be chosen to be close to the origin , as long as the velocity is small enough .",
    "condition ( [ condfn ] ) is therefore satisfied .",
    "formally , the right hand side of eq.([condfn ] ) is infinity because the light velocity is assumed to be infinity in non - relativistic cases .    in relativistic cases , the circular velocity satisfies @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , @xmath94 , are not infinitesimal for @xmath99 and a finite value of @xmath100 . far from the gravitational source , condition ( [ condfn ] ) may be satisfied . as the particle falls , the curvature increases , and the valid spatial range accordingly decreases . as it is difficult to know a priori whether or not the particle always moves inside the valid spatial range , it is necessary to check condition ( [ condfn ] ) in the evolution . to do this ,",
    "we numerically integrate eqs.([eqx ] ) and ( [ eqy ] ) with @xmath101 , for relativistic orbiting particles .",
    "orbits of relativistic particles are calculated from large @xmath55 , provided condition ( [ condfn ] ) is satisfied .",
    "numerical results are given for the motion with an initial circular velocity @xmath102 .",
    "the trajectories are shown for the gyro - center @xmath70 in the left panel and for @xmath71 in the right panel of figure 3 .",
    "condition ( [ condfn ] ) is no longer satisfied at the end of each curve , which corresponds to different time @xmath35 .",
    "the final phase is therefore masked because the particle eventually escapes outside valid fermi coordinates .",
    "this behavior seems to be general , because the particle motion is slow compared with the shrinkage of the valid spatial range , which is proportional to time @xmath55 , as shown in condition ( [ condfn ] ) .",
    "the orbits are almost the same as those of the non - relativistic cases shown in figure 1 , the main difference being the termination points ; this is due to the coordinate system .",
    "the relativistic effects on the orbits are not apparent .",
    "the locally measured value of velocity @xmath96 at the particle position is given by @xmath103 , which can be reduced to @xmath77 in flat spacetime .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath96 normalized by the initial velocity @xmath104 is shown in figure 4 .",
    "like the non - relativistic cases , the velocity increases with @xmath105 from the transition time @xmath80 .",
    "however , the final behavior , i.e , divergence of velocity seen in non - relativistic cases can not be treated in this system , because the particle position is outside the valid coordinate system .",
    "the sudden drop in velocity in the right panel of figure 4 corresponds to the kink in the orbit shown in figure 3 .",
    "this is caused by the tidal acceleration almost reversing the direction of the particle s orbit .",
    "it is very interesting to consider the tidal effect on a relativistic particle with a much larger initial velocity .",
    "is the particle accelerated up to the velocity of light ?",
    "we show the results for initial circular velocity , @xmath106 .",
    "the orbits are shown for gyro - center @xmath70 in the left panel and for @xmath71 in the right panel of figure 5 .",
    "the spiral of the orbits is much tighter due to the larger circular velocity . in their final phase",
    ", the particles always escape from the valid coordinate system , as in figure 3 , preventing us from following the subsequent evolution .",
    "this termination may artificially cause these orbits to converge to @xmath107 in the left panel and @xmath108 in the right panel .",
    "each position suggested from the figure is not a true convergent position because the end points do not correspond to the same coordinate time .",
    "curves that stopped at early have larger @xmath109 due to condition ( [ condfn ] ) .",
    "the time evolution of velocity @xmath103 is shown in figure 6 .",
    "it is normalized by the initial velocity @xmath110 .",
    "remarkably , the velocity never increases , and actually decreases . in this case , the tidal force causes deceleration , contrary to our intuition .",
    "the physical mechanism is not easily understood , but the mathematical origin is simple .",
    "the tidal acceleration terms coupled with velocity in eqs.([eqx ] ) and ( [ eqy ] ) change sign for large velocities of @xmath111 . beyond a critical value ,",
    "the tidal force becomes repulsive in the relativistic cases , whereas it is attractive in the non - relativistic cases .",
    "this property is analogous to that reported by chicone and mashhoon @xcite .",
    "we have calculated evolution for various values of the initial circular velocity in order to determine whether the tidal force causes acceleration or deceleration .",
    "it was found that the critical initial velocity is approximately @xmath112 , and that the velocity decreases above this value .",
    "in this paper , we have examined the tidal effect on a charged particle orbiting in a uniform magnetic field . from this simple toy model",
    ", we found that the tidal force changes the property when velocity is relativistic , as shown by chicone and mashhoon @xcite . in our model , the gyration velocity on the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane changes due to the tidal force coupled to the velocity , as the particle falls into a black hole along the @xmath0 axis .",
    "the velocity at the final plunging phase increases , when the initial velocity is less than a critical value . on the other hand ,",
    "the velocity decreases , when it is larger than the critical value .",
    "the critical value was about @xmath113 in our model , but depends on the process .",
    "as for speculative effects of the velocity - dependent tidal force in a more realistic astrophysical situation , suppose that a spinning neutron star falls into a black hole along the @xmath0 axis .",
    "the property of the tidal force depends on the rotating velocity @xmath114 , which corresponds to the orbiting velocity of the particle in our model .",
    "when @xmath114 exceeds a certain value , the tidal disruption may occur in a peculiar way , quite different from that in non - relativistic cases .",
    "the maximum rotation velocity of a neutron star is of the order @xmath115 at the equatorial plane ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is very interesting to investigate the evolutionary behavior and the critical velocity in the hydrodynamical process with the velocity - dependent tidal force .    as for the valid range of the coordinate system ,",
    "the fermi normal coordinates are set up around a geodesic reference observer , we used second - order expansion for the metric about the reference observer , and neglected higher order terms .",
    "the tidal force appears due to non - uniformities in the gravitational field , and is expressed by the deviation from the flat spacetime .",
    "the force becomes significant when the curvature tensors measured by the reference observer are large . at the same time , the higher order terms are no longer negligible . in other words , the valid range of the coordinate system shrinks as the gravitational source is approached . in order to study the final phase of the tidal disruption , it is important to include the higher order expansion terms .",
    "see e.g. , @xcite for the third order and fourth order expansion terms .",
