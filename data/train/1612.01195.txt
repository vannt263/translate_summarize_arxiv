    "potential energy functions play a central role in chemistry , and from these functions , the properties of a system can , in principle , be determined . often , the potential energy function is obtained from _ ab initio _ methods , but it can also be determined from experimental data using inverse techniques .",
    "inverse problems theory to handle experimental data has been applied to refine potential energy functions from the second virial coefficient,@xcite differential cross - sections@xcite and phase shifts.@xcite    the helium diatomic system at low temperatures has received considerable attention in recent years due to quantum and relativistic effects in their thermodynamics and transport properties.@xcite the theoretical interpretation of the results has been performed with the _ ab initio _",
    "potential function.@xcite the helium dimer has a very small potential well depth , measuring approximately 11 k,@xcite consequently , highly accurate calculations are required to obtain the potential energy function.@xcite    the present paper presents an alternative way to refine the helium potential energy function from viscosity coefficient data at low temperatures .",
    "few studies have been conducted along this line and often at high temperatures,@xcite limit in which classical theory is valid , and in parametric form , usually for a lennard - jones potential energy curve.@xcite    to gain insight into this problem , an investigation into the sensitivity@xcite of the viscosity coefficient to the potential energy function is conducted , and an adequate temperature range for experimental data was observed .",
    "the present study shows a higher sensitivity for long range potential in the temperature range below 5  k. since it is necessary to use viscosity coefficient data at low temperatures in an inverse procedure , a quantum strategy to refine the potential energy curve is necessary and will be presented in this study .",
    "the inverse problem was divided into two parts : in the first part , the cross - section is obtained from the viscosity coefficient , whereas in the second part , the potential energy function is determined from the cross - section .",
    "the solution to the first part was determined using the tikhonov regularization under a laplace integral equation formulation .",
    "in the second part , the relationship between the potential energy and the total cross - section , which is nonlinear , was linearized by a sensitivity analysis algorithm.@xcite    the cross - section sensitivity matrix established has an approximate linear relation between the potential energy and total cross - section . in a previous study,@xcite the functional derivative of the quantum phase shift with respect to the potential energy function",
    "was established and coupled with the variable phase equation .",
    "for the first time , this set of coupled differential equations was used to establish the cross - section sensitivity matrix within exact quantum theory .",
    "this problem is ill - posed , since sensitivity matrix elements possess values that are close to zero . in an attempt to circumvent this problem in a tractable way",
    ", the tikhonov regularization procedure was used again .    the result obtained by the inverse technique",
    "was compared with recent _ ab initio _ potentials@xcite and exhibited excellent agreement .",
    "the present work presents a general strategy to obtain an accurate inverted potential , comparable in quality with high level potential energy models and calculations .",
    "chapman - enskog theory@xcite provides a well - established perturbation method to calculate the viscosity coefficient @xmath2 of a non - ideal gas from the collision integral @xmath3 in a first order approach , the viscosity coefficient is given by @xmath4 in which @xmath5 is the mass of the system , and @xmath6 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "the collision integral of interest to determine the viscosity coefficient is set in the form @xmath7 with @xmath8 the temperature and @xmath9 the collision energy .",
    "the transport cross - section @xmath10 in classical statistical mechanics is directly related to the scattering angle , but in quantum assumptions and for the bose - einstein statistic , the cross - section is associated with the phase shift,@xcite as follows : @xmath11      \\label{eqq}\\ ] ] with @xmath12 the wave number , @xmath13 planck s constant and @xmath14 the angular moment .",

    "more details about the calogero equation can be found in the published works of lemes et al.,@xcite viterbo2014 et al.,@xcite and braga and murrell.@xcite the viscosity coefficient as a function of the temperature is determined by solving these equations , obeying the sequence ( [ eqc ] ) , ( [ eqq ] ) , ( [ eqo ] ) and ( [ visco ] ) .      in another approach ,",
    "it is desired to obtain the potential energy function from the viscosity coefficient in the opposite direction of the direct problem , that is , in the sequence ( [ visco ] ) , ( [ eqo ] ) , ( [ eqq ] ) and ( [ eqc ] ) .",
    "the first step consists of computing the collision integral @xmath21 from viscosity coefficient data using equation ( [ visco ] ) through simple algebraic manipulation .",
    "the second step consists of the evaluation of the transport cross - section @xmath22 from the collision integral @xmath23 and these quantities are related by equation ( [ eqo ] ) .",
    "the bold style was used to represent functions in matrix form . using the trapezoidal quadrature , equation ( [ eqo ] )",
    "is transformed to an algebraic form @xmath24 the solution of which is determined by the tikhonov regularization method as @xmath25 in which @xmath26 is a first approximation for @xmath27 with @xmath22 found , it is possible to obtain the potential energy @xmath28 from the cross - section through equations ( [ eqq ] ) and ( [ eqc ] ) .    the main difficulty of this strategy is to obtain the @xmath28 value from @xmath29 due to the nonlinear relationship between these two quantities .",
    "this difficulty can be avoided by linearization of the problem as follows : @xmath30 in which the matrix @xmath31 is the sensitivity matrix , with elements @xmath32 nevertheless , it is more appropriate to use equation ( [ eqlinear ] ) as @xmath33 with elements of @xmath34 in a normalized form , such as @xmath35 here , the adequate solution can not be found by an orthodox inverse matrix algorithm , because the matrix @xmath34 is ill conditioned .",
    "the inverse matrix will be given again by another tikhonov regularization @xmath36 in which @xmath37 is a parameter of regularization and is the identity matrix .",
    "finally , the desired solution is given by @xmath38 in which @xmath39 is an initial guess for @xmath40 in this case , the regularization parameter is chosen by an l - curve , and provides an equilibrium between a residual norm and a solution norm .",
    "the success of the present method relies on identifying a way to determine the sensitivity matrix . in a previous work,@xcite a differential equation for the functional derivative of the quantum phase shift with respect to the potential energy function , @xmath41 ,",

    "more details about this approach are given in the work of lemes et al.@xcite    by deriving equation ( [ eqq ] ) with respect to the potential energy function at @xmath47 the sensitivity cross - section @xmath49 will be given by    @xmath50\\\\      \\times      \\left[s_{\\delta_{l+2}}(\\kappa , r^*)-s_{\\delta_l}(\\kappa , r^*)\\right]\\ ] ]    where all of the necessary information is available from the previous step .",
    "this method provides a new , simple and exact way to establish the sensitivity cross - section matrix @xmath34 english in equation ( [ tikep ] ) .",
    "finally , the sensitivity matrix for the viscosity coefficient can be obtained by    @xmath51    in which @xmath52    there is no need to determine matrix ( [ senseeta ] ) in our method , but this matrix suggests a new procedure to recover the potential energy function from viscosity coefficient data , such as using @xmath53 instead of equation ( [ eqlinear ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , preliminary studies show that the condition number of matrix @xmath54 is larger than the condition number of matrix @xmath55 making this method more difficult than the procedure proposed in this study .",
    "figure [ fig1](a ) shows the contour lines of the normalized sensitivity matrix to the transport cross - section data , @xmath56 this result provides important insight into the inverse procedure , such as the choice of the experimental data range to be used .",
    "* figure 1 *    from figure [ fig1](a ) , it can be observed that the transport cross - section with @xmath46 between 0.2 and 0.5  @xmath57 has a larger value of sensitivity at interatomic distances between 3 and 4   .",
    "this region of @xmath46 provides experimental data that are more adequate to obtain the long range potential between 3 and 4   because small changes in the potential can cause large changes in the transport cross - section .",
    "since the @xmath46 values of approximately 0.1  @xmath57 correspond to energy values of approximately 0.1  k , it is better to use viscosity experimental data obtained at low temperatures for the inverse procedure .",
    "this conclusion can also be obtained from figure [ fig1](b ) , showing the sensitivity level curves for viscosity data .",
    "only a small number of papers have reported experimental data on viscosity coefficients at low temperatures .",
    "for the temperature range required to refine the potential curve between 3 and 4   , that is , below 5 k , the reference of becker et al.@xcite presents 11 values .",
    "however , the quality of these data has been questioned@xcite due to the use of an old reference value for equipment calibration , resulting in a positive deviation of approximately 5  % as estimated by bich and vogel.@xcite    to generate the necessary data of viscosity coefficients , the equation @xmath58\\right\\ } ,      \\label{nachereq}\\ ] ] was used.@xcite from this equation , 41 viscosity values , between 1 and 5  k , were determined and used to refine the potential curve .",
    "the values adjusted by the equation ( [ nachereq ] ) , shown in figure [ fig2 ] , agreed with the calculated results with the most precise potential for description of the system,@xcite with an average error of 0.8735  % , an error lower than that reported for the experimental data ( 5  % ) .",
    "therefore , henceforth we will refer to equation ( [ nachereq ] ) as experimental data .",

    "the function @xmath28 is the _ ab initio _ potential curve proposed in 2010,@xcite henceforth considered to be the reference potential .",
    "the @xmath28 curve was previously tested to evaluate the second virial coefficient between 3 and 100 k with excellent agreement with the experimental data.@xcite when this potential is compared with the most accurate potential describing the system,@xcite the difference is less than @xmath64 between 2.4 and 4.5   . nevertheless , both curves , varandas@xcite and przybytek et al.@xcite , describe the viscosity coefficient with an error less than 5  % for temperatures between 1 and 5  k. therefore , both _",
    "ab initio _ potential curves , namely , those of varandas@xcite and przybyteke et al.@xcite , are equally suitable to describe the viscosity coefficient between 1 and 5  k.    the difference between the potential curves @xmath65 and @xmath66 is controlled by the parameter @xmath67 when @xmath68 is equal to 0.2 the average difference is approximately 10  % . in this case , if the potential curve @xmath65 is used to calculate the viscosity data the average error found was 12.46  % , which is greater than the experimental error of 5  % .",
    "therefore , the calculated viscosity data from the potential curve @xmath65 are not within the experimental error , and it is not suitable for estimating the viscosisty coefficient .",
    "the determination of the viscosity coefficient from a potential energy curve involves three steps : the determination of the phase shift using equation ( [ eqc ] ) ; followed by the determination of the transport cross - section using equation ( [ eqq ] ) ; and finally the determination of the collision integral using equation ( [ eqo ] ) from which the viscosity can be readily calculated .",
    "numerical integration of calogero s equation ( [ eqc ] ) was performed using the euler algorithm , with a step of @xmath69   between 1.5 and 70000   .",
    "next , in equation ( [ eqq ] ) , the sum is carried over even angular moments between 0 and 20 .",
    "finally , the trapezoidal rule was used to numerically integrate equation ( [ eqo ] ) over 100 points between @xmath70 and 5.4 mev .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the experimental data@xcite together with the values calculated by equations ( [ eqc ] ) , ( [ eqq ] ) , ( [ eqo ] ) and ( [ visco ] ) , using the potential function @xmath71      the inverse problem consists of the determination of @xmath28 using known viscosity data , @xmath72 therefore , one has to solve the set of four equations in the reverse sequence : ( [ visco ] ) , ( [ eqo ] ) , ( [ eqq ] ) and ( [ eqc ] ) . the first step provides the values of the transport cross - section , which are shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "this step involves equation ( [ eqc ] ) , which is a linear ill - posed problem , whose solution is determined by the tikhonov regularization method , shown in equation ( [ tikq ] ) .",
    "* figure 3 *    the result shown in figure [ fig3 ] was obtained with @xmath73 and using a matrix * k * with dimensions of 41 ( temperature ) @xmath74 101 ( energy ) .",
    "the value of @xmath26 is obtained from @xmath65 following the direct method .    in the second part of the inverse procedure ,",
    "the equations ( [ eqq ] ) and ( [ eqc ] ) are rewritten as ( [ lnq ] ) , which is another linear ill - posed problem , the solution of which is provided by equation ( [ tikep ] ) . before using equation ( [ tikep ] ) to refine the potential energy function , one needs to determine the matrix * s * from equations ( [ eqsp ] ) and ( [ senseq ] ) .",
    "the coupled differential equations ( [ eqsp ] ) were solved using euler s method with initial conditions @xmath75 @xmath76 and @xmath77   . in the limit",
    "@xmath17 @xmath45 is the desired sensitivity value at fixed @xmath78 @xmath79 and @xmath80 therefore , solving the coupled differential equations ( [ tikep ] ) , for different values of @xmath47 @xmath46 and @xmath14 , we obtain the @xmath81 values from which , using equation ( [ eqg ] ) , we calculated @xmath82 and consequently @xmath83    now , knowing @xmath84 equation ( [ tikep ] ) can be used in the following manner : first , an initial guess , @xmath85 is given for the unknown potential , and the value of @xmath26 is computed for this first potential estimation .",

    "potential curve.@xcite the potential depth is -11.1  k for the potential obtained in this work , while for the reference potential , the depth is -11.0  k ; therefore , an error of less than 1  % is observed .",
    "the equilibrium distance is 2.96   for both potentials    * figure 4 *    the viscosity coefficient was determined using refined potential @xmath91 this result together with experimental data are shown in figure [ fig2 ] , for temperatures between 1 and 5  k. the improved potential is adequate to describe the experimental data with an average error of 1.6823  % against 12.4632  % when @xmath65 was used .",

    "this relationship is nonlinear , and a common method to solve this inverse problem can not be employed . to circumvent this difficulty , the sensitivity matrix was used to linearize this problem .",
    "the initial problem was rewritten as a linear fredholm integral equation of the first order , whose solution is given by the tikhonov method .",
