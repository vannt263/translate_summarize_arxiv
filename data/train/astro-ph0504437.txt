    "the series of low column density ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) absorption features seen blue - ward of the emission line in high redshift quasi - stellar object ( qso ) spectra trace the distribution of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "this forest of absorption lines provides a unique , unbiased probe of the thermal and ionization history of the igm along the qso line - of - sight .",
    "this has motivated many authors to use hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation , calibrated to reproduce the observed properties of the forest obtained from high resolution qso spectra , to infer the amplitude of the metagalactic uv background ( see the seminal paper by rauch 1997 , and most recently tytler 2004 ) .",
    "consequently there are a wide range of estimates for the hydrogen ionization rate per atom , , inferred from the forest opacity using numerical simulations with different assumptions .",
    "this complicates the comparison with determinations of the ionization rate from estimates of the integrated emission from observed qsos and/or galaxies ( _ e.g. _ haardt & madau 1996 , hereafter hm96 ; madau , haardt & rees 1999 ) and estimates using the proximity effect ( _ e.g. _ scott et al . 2000 ) which both also have rather large uncertainties .",
    "furthermore , steidel ( 2001 ) , in a study of lyman break galaxies at @xmath6 , suggested that the intensity of the ionizing background may be a factor of a few larger than in the model of hm96 due to a large contribution from star - forming galaxies .",
    "we discuss new estimates of the metagalactic hydrogen ionization rate presented in bolton ( 2005 ) , inferred from state - of - the - art hydrodynamical simulations of the forest .",
    "these estimates are consistent with a substantial contribution from galaxies to the amplitude of the uv background at the hydrogen ionization edge , and are in agreement with other observational estimates of the dimensionless quantity @xmath7 .",
    "we use a suite of @xmath8 high resolution hydrodynamical simulations run using a new version of gadget ( springel , yoshida & white , 2001 ) to investigate in detail the dependence of on physical and numerical parameters ( for a detailed description of the simulations see bolton 2005 ) .",

    "we assume @xmath10 and a helium mass fraction of @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , we adopt fiducial values for the thermal state of the gas at mean cosmic density ; @xmath12\\pm5000 $ ] @xmath13 at @xmath14 $ ] and @xmath15 for the index of the gas effective equation of state ( hui & gnedin 1997 ) , based on the results of schaye ( 2000 ) .",
    "we linearly rescale the opacity of the artificial forest spectra we construct to match the central values for the forest effective optical depth taken from the fitting formula of schaye ( 2003 ) : @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "we treat the amplitude of the uv background as a free parameter , so rescaling the neutral hydrogen opacity corresponds to linearly rescaling the hydrogen ionization rate by the same amount .",
    "we initially run @xmath17 simulations of our fiducial model with differing box size and resolution to assess the degree of numerical convergence .",
    "we find simulations with less than @xmath18 gas particles within a @xmath19 comoving mpc box do not achieve adequate numerical convergence .",
    "we take our fiducial model to have @xmath20 gas particles within a @xmath21 comoving mpc box ; we estimate the value of we infer will be systematically high by around @xmath22 per cent due to the combined error from box size and resolution .     on the gas temperature at mean density @xmath23 at the three different redshifts indicated on the plot .",

    "when inferring from hydrodynamical simulations and subsequently rescaling with different parameters , it is generally assumed that ( @xmath27 rauch 1997 ) :    @xmath28    it is implicit in this relation that the density and velocity distribution , along with the effective equation of state of the absorbers remain unchanged for different values of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath25 .",
    "we test the validity of equation  [ eq : gscale ] using @xmath33 simulations in addition to our fiducial model , by varying the parameters @xmath32 , and in each run .",
    "we also rescale to different values for the temperature - density relation index @xmath26 and the effective optical depth in post - processing .",
    "we do not discuss the scaling with and @xmath30 , since our analysis revealed that equation  [ eq : gscale ] holds extremely well for these parameters .",

    "the filled squares and triangles show the estimated contribution to the metagalactic ionization rate from qsos+galaxies and qsos alone , based on estimates from the updated model of madau , haardt & rees ( 1999 ) including uv photons from re - processing by the igm .",
    "the hatched box gives the constraint on from the proximity effect ( scott 2000 ) and the estimate from lyman - break galaxies assuming a global spectral index of @xmath35 is plotted with a filled circle ( steidel 2001 ) .",

    "in recent years , compelling observational evidence has led to the acceptance of a standard cosmological model which is flat , has low matter density and a substantial contribution of vacuum energy to the total energy density . within this concordance cosmological model",
    "the current generation of hydrodynamical simulations predict values for the metagalactic hydrogen ionization rate , required to reproduce the effective optical depth of the igm in the range @xmath39 , which are about a factor of four larger than those in an einstein - de sitter model with the same r.m.s .",

    "this discrepancy increases with increasing redshift .",
    "we confirm the findings of tytler et al .",
    "( 2004 ) at @xmath41 that the estimated ionization rates from simulations of a concordance model are in reasonable agreement with the estimates of the integrated ionizing flux from observed qsos plus a significant contribution from galaxies as in the model of mhr99 .",
    "the estimates of the ionization rate are also in agreement with the lower end of the range of values from the proximity effect .",
    "this new agreement appears to be in part due to the currently favoured low value of , which increases the required value of , and more accurate measurements of the forest opacity .",
    "we also find that the uncertainty on the magnitude of inferred from simulations is greater than previously estimated , with the primary contribution to this error coming from the temperature of the low density gas in the igm .",
    "better constraints on the thermal history of the igm are required .",
    "additional physics such as radiative transfer , galactic feedback and metal enrichment may need to be incorporated into simulations in a more realistic fashion . however , our estimate of the error on most likely accounts for the modest changes expected from these processes , suggesting we have obtained a consistent constraint on the metagalactic hydrogen ionization rate .",
