    "this paper relies heavily on the results of its companion @xcite . in the latter work ,",
    "we have defined a lattice model which , we argued , is in the universality class of the @xmath0 coset sigma model , and carefully studied the decomposition of the hilbert space of the corresponding quantum spin chain @xmath6 under the action of the supergroup @xmath0 and its non - semisimple commutant @xmath1 .",
    "we shall now use these results to obtain information on the boundary spectrum of the model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "various easily obtained results in the continuum limit are collected .",
    "section 3 deals with the weak coupling limit in the bulk .",
    "subsection 3.1 tackles the minisuperspace analysis , subsection 3.2 defines and studies the small coupling expansion around @xmath7 , subsection 3.3 discusses the exact structure of the theory as @xmath8 and subsection 3.4 compares our perturbative approach with the one of wegner formally extended to the @xmath9 case .",
    "section 4 exploits the algebraic structures of the lattice model elucidated in the first paper to formulate two essential conjectures about the boundary spectrum .",
    "section 5 presents thorough numerical checks of these conjectures .",
    "section 6 discusses potential relationship with the @xmath9 gross neveu models and our third conjecture .",
    "section 7 contains our conclusions .",
    "all notations are consistent with those in @xcite . in addition , some of the new notations introduced in what follows are :    * @xmath10 , coupling constant of the sigma model * @xmath11 the chiral algebra obtained from the brauer algebra in the continuum limit",
    "as discussed at the end of section 2 in @xcite , the periodic partition function of the @xmath0 model on the annulus is obtained by calculating the supertrace of the appropriate power of the transfer matrix , which translates geometrically by giving to all non contractible loops a weight two .",
    "this partition function is thus _ identical _ with the one of the 6 vertex model .",
    "the continuum limit is well known to be described by a free compactified boson with dirichlet boundary conditions on either sides of the annulus .",
    "this bosonic degree of freedom comes from the interpretation of the 6 vertex model as a solid on solid model with height variables dual to the arrows .",
    "it is traditional to write the action for this boson @xmath12 as : @xmath13 with @xmath12 quantized on a circle of circumference @xmath14 .",
    "standard results show the relation between the coupling constant @xmath15 and the anisotropy parameter of the lattice model : @xmath16 so the case @xmath17 corresponds @xmath18 and @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "the continuum limit of the partition function is then @xmath21 where @xmath22 is integer for a lattice of even width , and @xmath22 is half an odd integer for a lattice of odd width .",
    "we have introduced the modular parameter @xmath23 to describe the annulus where @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the transverse length ( so the hamiltonian or transfer matrix act on the space @xmath6 ) and @xmath26 is the length in imaginary time ( this @xmath27 must not be confused with the transfer matrix , also denoted by the same letter in what follows ) .",
    "@xmath28 is the usual dedekind function @xmath29    we note however that the loop partition function for the @xmath0 model coincides with neumann boundary conditions in terms of the orthosymplectic vector field ( dirichlet boundary conditions would turn into loops having open ends on the boundary ) .",
    "therefore , the correspondence with the sigma model is best understood by turning to the dual of the field @xmath12 whose action is @xmath30 the partition function ( [ zdd ] ) can then be reinterpreted as the partition function with neumann boundary conditions @xmath31        in sec .  3.1 of @xcite we have defined for the spin chain @xmath6 a , so called , quasiperiodic partition function depending on a supermatrix @xmath39 encoding the set of all possible boundary conditions .",
    "let us call _ twisted _ the subset of boundary conditions such that @xmath40 .",
    "the simplest twisted boundary condition is of the form @xmath41 and the supermatrix @xmath42 encoding it is in fact the reflection @xmath43 described in @xcite .    the twisted boundary condition in eq",
    ".   defines a twisted partition function @xmath44 which can be easily computed in the path integral formalism .",
    "this , again leads to the cancellation of @xmath35 bosonic integrals against the fermionic ones leaving the fields @xmath45 .",
    "after a simple rotation by @xmath46 in the space @xmath45 one can see that the twisted boundary conditions in eq .",
    "are equivalent to antiperiodic boundary conditions for the field @xmath47 itself .",
    "the partition function for the compactified boson @xmath47 is therefore : @xmath48^{-1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the laplacian with dirichlet boundary conditions in space and antiperiodic boundary conditions in ( imaginary ) time direction : @xmath50 note that this partition function is independent of @xmath51 , ie of the weight of the intersections .    the fermionic fields in eq .",
    "are periodic .",
    "one can as well consider antiperiodic boundary conditions for fermions .",
    "therefore we shall distinguish between the periodic and antiperiodic twisted partition functions , the one in eq .",
    "being periodic .    in the discrete loop model picture , imposing either periodic or antiperiodic twisted boundary conditions amounts to giving a weight 0 to the loops winding the annulus an odd number of times .",
    "the difference resides in choosing 2 or @xmath52 for the loops winding the annulus an even ( nonzero ) number of times .      in the case",
    "@xmath53 , loops do not intersect and the partition function can be easily computed .",
    "noncontractible loops can wind only once around the system and get a weight @xmath54 for ( anti)periodic boundary conditions for bosons(fermions ) .",
    "the partition function can be written as @xmath55 for an even lattice , while for an odd lattice , the sum runs @xmath22 half an odd integer ( and thus adding odd and even widths gives the same sum for @xmath22 half integer ) . here , @xmath56 and @xmath57 is determined through @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) , the dimension of the fundamental .",
    "we then find the number of @xmath60 fields to be @xmath61 , a result indicating the underlying @xmath62 symmetry .",
    "note that @xmath63 .",
    "the total number of @xmath64 fields in the open boundary partition function is thus the sum of the number of currents and @xmath65 additional primary fields in the rank 2 symmetric @xmath62 tensor .",
    "note that the partition function for even lattice can also be written as @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "evaluating the difference of the two dimensions leads to the simple formula : @xmath68 the modular transform immediately follows : @xmath69 where @xmath70 and exhibits complex exponents .",
    "these complex exponents can be traced back to the complex electric charges in the free boson theory ( [ freebosonact ] ) necessary to give non contractible loops a weight greater than two .",
    "it is not clear of course that the modular transform of the modified partition function should have a useful meaning in the sigma model cft : antiperiodic boundary conditions for fermions in the space direction do not have to be included for consistency of the model ( unlike say , for the majorana fermions of the ising model ) .",
    "there is yet another way of obtaining the partition function in eq .   at @xmath53 if one knows : i ) the trace of the transfer matrix restricted to an irrep of the temperley lieb algebra and ii ) the decomposition of representations of @xmath1 into irreps of the temperley lieb algebra . according to sec .",
    "4.1 of @xcite , the partition function with most general boundary conditions ( encoded in the matrix @xmath42 ) can be written in the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 @xmath73 are @xmath74 generalized symmetric functions and @xmath75 is the character of the standard @xmath1 representation @xmath76 .",
    "on the other hand , according to the discussion in sec .",
    "5.2 of @xcite , the standard module @xmath77 decomposes into a direct sum of irreps @xmath78 of the temperley lieb algebra as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the number of standard young tableaux of shape @xmath81 and @xmath82 are multiplicities .",
    "if @xmath83 is the character of the temperley lieb irrep @xmath84 in the limit @xmath85 , then according to @xcite ( this is discussed in more details below ) @xmath86 and , therefore , in the continuum limit the partition function of the dense intersecting loop model at @xmath53 becomes @xmath87 \\frac{q^{j^2}- q^{(j+1)^2 } } { \\eta(\\tau)}.\\ ] ] in simple terms , huge degeneracies appear at this point .",
    "indeed , since loop crossings are not allowed ( @xmath53 ) , different operators corresponding to different symmetries of the non contractible lines now become identical .",
    "the limit where @xmath89 of the bulk spectrum can be analyzed using a minisuperspace approximation .",
    "such a strategy has proved extremely successful in recent analysis of wzw models on supergroups in particular @xcite .",
    "indeed , consider the sigma model on a cylinder of circumference @xmath90 or , equivalently , at temperature @xmath91 . doing a wick rotation",
    "transforms the space into a basic circle @xmath92 , while the imaginary time runs to infinity along the axis of the cylinder . at small @xmath90 - ie large temperature",
    "- it is reasonable to neglect the fluctuations of the fields in the transverse direction , and replace the fields @xmath93 by @xmath94 .    to be more precise ,",
    "let us describe the problem in a hamiltonian formalism .",
    "in general , one has to deal with wave functions @xmath95 which are functions of the field configuration at a given time ( or imaginary time ) , @xmath96 $ ] . in the minisuperspace limit , these become functions of the @xmath97 independent approximation of the fields , ie _ functions on the target space itself_. if the sigma model of interest is a model on a ( super)group , the wavefunctions become functions on that ( super)group . the hamiltonian becomes a differential operator on these functions .    to see how this works and fix notations ,",
    "consider briefly the @xmath98 action @xmath99=     { 1\\over 4\\pi g}\\int d^{2}x(\\partial_{\\mu}\\varphi)^{2}\\ ] ] with @xmath47 the angle of the vector @xmath100 , quantized on a circle of circumference @xmath14 .",
    "the minisuperspace approximation should be valid in the limit of @xmath15 large .",
    "this corresponds to small temperatures in the xy model , ie the limit where the free floating vortex operators are strongly irrelevant .",
    "so , in the minisuperspace approximation , the action in eq .   @xmath101 yields the quantised hamiltonian @xmath102 here @xmath103 is the canonical momentum associated with @xmath47 , the equal time commutator is @xmath104 = 1/i$ ] and @xmath105 is the laplacian on the circle .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath106 has eigenfunctions @xmath107 with eigenenergies @xmath108 .",
    "again , this approximation should become good when @xmath109 is large , so these dimensions are small and accumulate near the ground state .    on the other hand , @xmath106 reads , in the virasoro formalism @xmath110 the spectrum is thus , from the exact solution",
    ", @xmath111 and coincides in the limit @xmath109 small with the one obtained in the minisuperspace limit indeed .",
    "note that the central charge being a contribution of order @xmath112 to the spectrum should not be visible in the minisuperspace approximation .",
    "let us now apply these ideas to the simplest non trivial model of our series , namely the supersphere @xmath113 .",
    "we shall not dwell here on the subtleties related to rigorous definition of the supersphere as a supermanifold in the sense of mathematicians .",
    "instead , we prefer to define it directly as the coset space @xmath114 .    to be more specific let us fix some notations .",
    "let @xmath115 be some grassman algebra with a large enough number of generators @xmath25 .",
    "consider the linear space @xmath116 over @xmath117 composed of points @xmath118 , which can be parametrized by four even coordinates @xmath119 , @xmath120 and two odd coordinates @xmath121 , @xmath122 .",
    "@xmath116 becomes a supereuclidian linear space @xmath123 if we endow it with a scalar product which is defined as follows : for two points @xmath124 with coordinates @xmath125 and , respectively , @xmath126 put @xmath127 where @xmath128 . to distinguish between even and odd components we introduce the grading function @xmath129 which is zero evaluated on even indices and one on the odd ones , e.g. @xmath130 .",
    "it is then natural to associate to each @xmath131 a point @xmath132 in the dual space by the usual index lowering procedure @xmath133 in such a way that the scalar product @xmath134 becomes @xmath135 and to each endomorphism @xmath136 of @xmath123 the dual(transpose ) @xmath137 by the correspondence @xmath138 . in matrix components",

    "however , when the body of some component @xmath151 vanishes , that is @xmath154 , only the square of the soul of @xmath151 is fixed by eq .  , which is not enough to uniquely determine the soul itself .",

    "a similar singularity also occurs at the point @xmath53 . in that case",
    "however , the @xmath316 phase has less interesting features than for the case @xmath317 , while the operator coupled to @xmath51 is relevant . here",
    ", the value @xmath18 corresponds to some operators becoming marginal .",
    "the value @xmath18 plays for the 6 vertex model a role similar to the kosterlitz thouless point for the @xmath98 model ; beyond the value @xmath53 , the 6 vertex model enters a massive phase , and has no longer a continuum limit of interest .",
    "we can however perfectly well continue our formula beyond @xmath18 . in the case of the free boson",
    ", the result still describes the partition function of a well defined theory , which would be obtained as the continuum limit of a lattice model where `` the bare fugacity of vortices is turned to zero '' .",
    "similarly , it is natural to expect that the @xmath9 coset sigma model can be defined for any @xmath15 ( note that for @xmath318 the supersphere has trivial homotopy ) .",
    "we observe now that if we set @xmath319 or @xmath320 in our conjectured formula , we obtain , parametrizing now the young diagram by the lengths @xmath321 of the first two rows and @xmath322 for the first column @xmath323 this formula has an appealing physical interpretation . indeed , consider now the @xmath74 gn model @xmath324.\\ ] ] the central charge of this model is of course @xmath325 ( with a contribution of @xmath326 from the fermionic sector and @xmath327 from the bosonic one ) .",
    "its beta function vanishes identically , just like in the case of the coset sigma model .",
    "consider now the free point @xmath328 where the theory reduces to four majorana fermions and a @xmath329 system .",
    "the @xmath330 acts on the fermions here , and the @xmath331 on the bosons , in contrast with the supersphere sigma model where the @xmath330 acts on the bosons and the @xmath331 on the ( symplectic ) fermions .    in the free theory , the basic fields @xmath332 all have dimension @xmath333 , and they live in the fundamental representation .",
    "it is easy to organize all the fields of the theory in terms of representations of the global @xmath74 symmetry by means of young diagrams .",
    "_ irreps_. we only use the fact that a ( traceless ) tensor of shape @xmath81 necessarily contains the @xmath74 irreps of highest weight @xmath81 and , if @xmath81 is atypical , it might also contains irreps representation of highest weight @xmath334 . ]",
    "consider a young diagram of shape @xmath81 . to build a tensor corresponding to @xmath81",
    "one has to proceed as in the case of the sigma model , that is to super(anti)symmetrize indices   of the fundamental representation of @xmath74 . ] in a row(column ) . in this case , however , even indices correspond to fermionic fields @xmath335 ( in different points ) , while odd indices correspond to bosonic fields @xmath336 . therefore , the components of a tensor of hook shape @xmath337 corresponding to an @xmath338 highest weight @xmath339 acquire , after the fusion , the dimension @xmath340 which is exactly eq .  .",
    "this is , of course , the lowest possible dimension for a multiplet of @xmath338 fields in a highest weight representation @xmath341 .",
    "all other fields with the same symmetry @xmath341 have dimensions that differ by the previous one by integers .",
    "they can be constructed in two ways : i ) instead of taking the fundamental fields themselves in order to build tensor one can take as well their derivatives ii ) one can also multiplying the previously considered fields with @xmath338 scalars , e.g. @xmath342 .",
    "thus we propose that the continuation of the sigma model to @xmath319 coincides with the gn model at @xmath328 , which is nothing but the @xmath74 wzw model at level @xmath343 . in eq .",
    "clearly provide a free field representation for @xmath344 .",
    "the level of the @xmath345 free field representation provided by the fields @xmath336 can be derived from the normalization of the @xmath338 even roots : @xmath346 . ]    to check this further , let us observe that the full organization of the fields in the wzw can be obtained more explicitly by analyzing the characters of the current algebra in this theory .",
    "one finds two representations @xmath347 for the affine superalgebra based on the trivial and fundamental representations of @xmath338 , with characters @xmath348 @xmath349 here the @xmath350 are affine characters of @xmath351 : @xmath352\\nonumber\\\\ \\notag \\chi^{-1/2}_1(\\tau , u)&={\\eta(\\tau)\\over 2}\\left[{1\\over      \\theta_4(\\tau , u/2)}-{1\\over \\theta_3(\\tau , u/2)}\\right]\\\\ \\notag \\chi^1_0(\\tau , u ) & = \\frac{\\theta_3(2\\tau , u)}{\\eta(\\tau)}\\\\ \\chi^1_1(\\tau , u ) & = \\frac{\\theta_2(2\\tau , u)}{\\eta(\\tau)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to compute the supercharacters one has to insert @xmath353 into the trace , that is formally make the shift @xmath354 .",
    "imposing periodic boundary conditions for both fermions and bosons yields a supertrace partition function . evaluating the characters in eq .   with @xmath355",
    "we get , as expected from sec .",
    "[ sec : per_pf ] , the partition function of the compactified boson at @xmath319 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath43 be the outer automorphism of @xmath338 .",
    "then one can define twisted characters via @xmath356 noticing that @xmath43 acts only on the @xmath357 dynkin labels it is not hard to prove that the @xmath358 twisted characters in eq .",
    "are given by the same formulas   except the @xmath359 characters are now replaced by their twisted versions @xmath360 here again , evaluating the @xmath358 twisted characters at @xmath361 we get , as expected from sec .",
    "[ sec : tw_pf ] , the twisted characters of the compactified boson @xmath362 and @xmath363 .",
    "adding up the two affine characters in eq .   and",
    "developping in powers of @xmath364 in the point @xmath365 we get the partition function @xmath366 which is in agreement with eq .  , and weighs strongly in favor of our identification of the point @xmath319 .",
    "this in turn provides another look at the conjectures .",
    "indeed , instead of thinking of the critical line as a supersphere sigma model with running coupling constant @xmath2 , we may think of it as a gn model with running coupling constant @xmath367 .",
    "the deformation of this model away from the wzw ( free ) point is a current current perturbation , for which methods of conformal perturbation theory can be applied somewhat more comfortably than in the sigma model case .",
    "we start by writing generally the current algebra as @xmath368 where the greek labels take values in the adjoint .",
    "the @xmath28 s and the @xmath369 s characterize the algebra , and one has the usual relations @xmath370[\\beta]}\\eta^{\\beta\\alpha}\\nonumber\\\\ f^{\\alpha\\beta}_\\gamma=-(-)^{[\\alpha][\\beta]}f^{\\beta\\alpha}_\\gamma\\nonumber\\\\ f^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}=f^{\\alpha\\beta}_\\delta \\eta^{\\delta\\gamma}\\nonumber\\\\ \\eta_{\\alpha\\beta}\\eta^{\\beta\\gamma}=\\delta_\\alpha^\\gamma.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a crucial property of @xmath0 is that the casimir in the adjoint vanishes : @xmath371 this can also be used in the form @xmath372 .",
    "another crucial property is that in @xmath0 there is only one invariant rank three tensor , the structure constants @xmath373 ( in other words , every invariant in the 3-fold tensor product of the adjoint is proportional to @xmath369 ) . using these features",
    ", it seems possible to argue that , exactly like in the case of the @xmath374 sigma model @xcite , the perturbation theory away from the wzw point is abelian , and leads to corrections to the exponents proportional , to all orders , to @xmath375 times the casimir . in other words",
    ", we expect for the gn model that @xmath376 which is identical with our second conjecture .",
    "this leads us to our third conjecture @xmath377    finally , note that , while for @xmath378 then the identity field @xmath379 has the lowest scaling dimension @xmath380 among all allowable states of the theory , in contrast , as soon as @xmath381 the scaling dimension of tensor fields of shape @xmath382 get arbitrarily large and negative for @xmath383 big enough , and the model presumably becomes unstable .",
    "therefore , the point @xmath319 has to be the end of the critical line of the sigma model .",
    "this work can be summarized in our three conjectures ( [ c1],[guess],[c3 ] ) . for each of these",
    ", we have given a more or less complete list of arguments and verifications - including numerical ones .",
    "going beyond this , at the present stage , entails considerable difficulties , which we postpone for future work .",
    "one of the most obvious questions to tackle would be the nature of the boundary conditions inherited from the lattice discretization , the full lowest order calculation of the anomalous dimensions , and the control of higher order calculations , which , according to our analysis should vanish for all representations , and not only the fully symmetric ones .",
    "another very important question that requires further understanding is the nature of the algebra we have called @xmath11 , which appears as the natural continuum limit of the brauer algebra .    an interesting output of our work and our first conjecture is that the boundary spectrum is determined by the casimir decomposition of the spectrum at the @xmath312 ( or , if the third conjecture is correct , at the wzw point @xmath319 ) .",
    "this points to a special role played by the casimir algebra in the continuum limit , which is not obvious from the consideration of conserved quantities in the continuum action of the model @xcite , but , as we have explained , quite natural from the lattice model point of view . of the affine",
    "lie algebra @xmath384 in usual wzw models .",
    "it contains the ( enveloping algebra of the ) virasoro algebra , but is much bigger in wzw models , since it also contains for instance the modes from the higher order singlet fields under @xmath15 built out of the currents @xcite .",
    "this is very similar to the observations made in @xcite .",
    "the characters of this algebra appear in general as branching functions in expansions of characters of the affine algebra @xmath384 into characters of @xmath15 .",
    "they are not the same as the characters of the algebra generated by the casimir fields , though the two are related in an involved way @xcite . ]",
    "it seems natural to expect that further progress will come from investigating this question more thoroughly .",
