    "classical light propagating through arrays of coupled waveguides has provided a fertile ground for the simulation of quantum physics @xcite .",
    "these optical analogies of quantum phenomena are changing the way photonic integrated devices are designed ; e.g. one - directional couplers @xcite , light rectifiers @xcite , isolators and polarization splitters @xcite .",
    "as the manufacturing quality for experimental devices increases @xcite , it will soon be possible to propagate non - classical light states through linear photonic devices and a full - quantum analysis of the problem is at hand . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "propagation through an array of @xmath0 coupled linear waveguides is ruled by the schrdinger - like equation @xmath1 with a hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath2 where the real parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 are related to the effective refractive index of the @xmath5th waveguide and to the distance between the @xmath5th and @xmath6th waveguides , in that order .",
    "the operators @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) annihilate ( create ) a photon and @xmath9 gives the number of photons at the @xmath5th waveguide .",
    "note that the vacuum state @xmath10 does not couple to any other states .",
    "thus we will expect that states with an important vacuum component , e.g. coherent states @xmath11 with a small coherent parameter @xmath12 , will serve as good examples for the peculiarities of propagation in the quantum model .    while bloch oscillations of noon path - entangled photons have been theoretically studied in the heisenberg picture @xcite ,",
    "here we are interested in bringing forward a method in schrdinger picture and introduce a class of tight - binding waveguide arrays related to orthogonal polynomials .",
    "then , we study a two - waveguide coupler and propagate fock , coherent , two - mode entangled and two - mode squeezed states . finally , we analyze the propagation of such non - classical states in a well - known photonic lattice used for the coherent transport of classical fields and close with a brief discussion .",
    "for models with just nearest neighbor coupling , hamiltonian ( [ eq : genham ] ) reduces to the form : @xmath13 the equations of motion for the annihilation operators can be written in matrix form , @xmath14 , where the auxiliary matrix @xmath15 is tridiagonal , real and symmetric ; i.e. it is a jacobi matrix , @xmath16_{j , k } = \\omega_{j } \\delta_{j , j } + g_{j } \\left(\\delta_{j , k-1 } + \\delta_{j-1,k } \\right)$ ] .",

    "the eigenvalues @xmath24 are calculated by the method of minors as the zeros of the polynomial @xmath25 with @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "then , we can define a set of multimode annihilation operators @xmath29 that diagonalize hamiltonian ( [ eq : spham ] ) , @xmath30 for parameters that do not depend on the propagation distance , the propagator is given by : @xmath31 some quantities of interest that can be measured in an experimental scheme and tracked analytically are the number of photons at each waveguide , @xmath32_{j}^{\\dagger } \\left[\\mathbb{v}^{-1 } \\vec{a } \\right]_{j } \\hat{u}(z ) \\vert \\psi(0 ) \\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the notation @xmath33_{j}$ ] has been used to represent the @xmath5th element of vector @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the inverse matrix `` of @xmath19 , and the two - point correlation function , @xmath36_{p}^{\\dagger } \\left[\\mathbb{v}^{-1 } \\vec{a } \\right]_{p } \\left[\\mathbb{v}^{-1 } \\vec{a } \\right]_{q}^{\\dagger } \\left[\\mathbb{v}^{-1 } \\vec{a } \\right]_{q } \\hat{u}(z ) \\vert \\psi(0 ) \\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that correlates the photon numbers detected at two waveguides .",
    "we could choose a higher order detection probability @xmath37 @xcite ; the two - point correlation function is related to single detection @xmath38 .",
    "we will also use the fidelity , @xmath39 that measures how similar the propagated state @xmath40 is to a given state @xmath41 ; sadly , this measurement can not be realized experimentally without full state reconstruction .",
    "this procedure is valid for any given set of real parameters @xmath42 but here we are interested in bringing forward some specific lattices related to orthogonal polynomials .",
    "the classical propagation of light fields has already been studied for some of these finite lattices : ( i ) identical refractive indices and identical couplings @xcite , the eigenvalues are given by the roots of the @xmath0th chebyshev polynomial , @xmath43 and the components of the eigenvector matrix @xmath44_{j , k } \\propto u_{k}(\\lambda_{j}/2)$ ] .",

    ". the method can also be applied for semi - infinite lattices ; e.g. refractive indices given by @xmath52 and couplings given by @xmath53 @xcite lead to eigenvalues @xmath54 and to elements of the eigenvectors matrix proportional to jacobi polynomials .",
    "in order to give a practical example , let us study propagation of non - classical light states through two coupled photonic waveguides described by the hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath55 where the parameters @xmath56 is a real numbers related to the refractive indices difference and the diagonalization parameters are @xmath57 and @xmath58 with @xmath59^{-1/2}$ ] , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 @xcite .",

    "we are used to think that light will transfer from one to the other waveguide for a classical field impinging one of two - identical waveguides , @xmath79 , but in the quantum case we have to remember that the vacuum state does not couple between the guides .",
    "thus , whenever a non - classical state of light with a strong vacuum component impinges the two - waveguide coupler , the vacuum part of the whole state will remain at the initial waveguide ; e.g. a single photon impinging one of the waveguides will transfer to the second but something different will happen for a coherent state with a mean photon number of one or less than one photon . for the single photon impinging the first waveguide , @xmath80 , the mean photon number at the waveguides are given by @xmath81 and @xmath82 , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) , and the fidelity , @xmath83 , will oscillate between zero and one for identical waveguides @xmath77 , @xmath84 , fig .",

    "the two - correlation functions for identical waveguides will also show a periodic transfer of the quantum state between the waveguides , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](c ) . for a coherent state ,",
    "@xmath85 , the amplitude for the vacuum state component is proportional to @xmath86 and will not transfer to the second waveguide .",
    "thus , for a coherent state with mean photon number equal or less than one , @xmath12 , the vacuum amplitude will be large enough compared to the other amplitudes ; e.g. for @xmath73 the mean photon number at each waveguide , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](d ) , looks identical to that of the single photon case but the fidelities , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](e ) , and two - point correlation functions , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](f ) , tell us that the initial quatum state of light is never transferred to the second waveguide .",

    "[ fig : fig1](j - l ) . again the mean photon number at each waveguide for each case will look identical but the behavior of the fidelities and two - point correlation functions tell us that in the first case the initial state does not evolve while in the second case it does evolve .",

    "the photonic lattice is described by the parameter set @xmath77 and @xmath99 with @xmath100 and @xmath101 . ]",
    "recently , a lattice providing perfect transfer of classical light described by the hamiltonian @xmath102 has been proposed and demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "the size of the lattice is given by @xmath0 and the parameter @xmath103 is the distance at which the transfer from the initial to the final end is given .",
    "the eigenvector matrix @xmath21 for this photonic lattice is given by jacobi polynomials @xcite and can transfer any given state initially impinging the @xmath5th waveguide into the @xmath104th waveguide as long as the initial state does not involve a vacuum component .",
    "when the initial state has a strong vacuum component , this particular part of the state will not transfer and this will reflect in the fidelity at the output and the two - point correlations as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : fig2 ] .",
    "again we can see that the single photon input and the coherent state with a single photon mean photon number show identical mean photon number propagation , fig .",

    "[ fig : fig2](b ) and [ fig : fig2](e ) , and two - point correlation functions , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](c ) and [ fig : fig2](f ) , tell us that only in the single photon case the initial state is faithfully transferred to the end of the lattice .",
    "the same happens when we compare the propagation of a two - mode path - entangled state with that of a two - mode squeezed vacuum , both with a total mean photon number of one ; the mean photon number propagation at each waveguide are identical but the fidelities and two - point correlation functions will differ and point to faithful state transfer just in the case of the two - mode path - entangled state .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2](g)-[fig : fig2](i ) show the propagation results for the two - mode entangeld state and fig.[fig : fig2](j)-[fig : fig2](l ) show the propagation of a two - mode squeezed vacuum state with a squeezing parameter @xmath76 leading to a total mean photon number of one .",
    "we have shown a method to deal with non - classical light propagating through tight - binding arrays of coupled linear waveguides . while we focused on listing refractive indices and coupling parameters that allow us to diagonalize the quantum hamiltonian by use of multimode annihilation operators whose cofficients",
    "are given in terms of orthogonal polynomials , the method can be used for any given set of parameters as a real symmetric tridiagonal matrix is always feasible of diagonalization . for the sake of bringing forward one of the most pronounced difference between propagation of classical and non - classical states of light",
