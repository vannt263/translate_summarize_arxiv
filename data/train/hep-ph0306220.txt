    "a systematic approach to the investigation of the symmetry breaking structure of fermion - gauge theories is to use low - energy effective lagrangians @xcite to study the goldstone modes corresponding to the spontaneously broken global symmetries @xcite .",
    "ideally , one would like to understand the phase diagram of fermion - gauge theories in the @xmath0 plane , where @xmath1 is the temperature , and @xmath2 is the ( baryon number ) chemical potential .",
    "however , it is not known how to analyze general fermion - gauge systems at finite baryon density , since the baryon number chemical potential makes the euclidean dirac operator non - hermitian and the boltzmann weight complex .",
    "this problem can be avoided , as advocated in @xcite , by considering `` two - color qcd '' , for which the fundamental representation of @xmath3 is pseudoreal . from studies of 4d theories",
    ", it has long been appreciated that the @xmath3 theory exhibits exotic types of spontaneous breakdown of global symmetry @xcite .",
    "quarks and charge - conjugated antiquarks are combined into an extended flavor multiplet , which is expected to break into its extended vector subgroup .",
    "this has the consequence that in lattice simulations the boltzmann weight is real even at finite ( baryon number ) chemical potential @xmath2 .",
    "for an even number of flavors , the boltzmann weight is also positive definite .",
    "thus , analytic predictions can be quantitatively compared with monte carlo simulations in lattice gauge theory @xcite , provided the lattice regularization respects the relevant flavor symmetry group .",
    "such studies have recently been carried out @xcite in 4d qcd with quarks in pseudoreal ( and real ) representations at finite @xmath2 .    in @xcite",
    "we studied the @xmath4 case of 3d two - color qcd , and found that the phase structure predicted by the tree - level effective potential was qualitatively the same as the 4d case studied in @xcite , even though the details of the symmetry breaking in 3d are completely different from in 4d .",
    "this universality between 3d and 4d corresponds to the existence of two different breakings of the original global symmetry by a mass and a chemical potential term . in this paper",
    "we extend the 3d analysis of @xcite to include nonzero temperature effects via the one - loop effective potential , as was done recently for the 4d system in @xcite .",
    "the loop effects introduce another difference between 3d and 4d , as infrared physics is more significant in 3d . as a result",

    "the pseudoreality of the fundamental representation of @xmath3 means that the naive @xmath13 flavor symmetry is extended to @xmath14 , and the continuous part of this global symmetry group is predicted to break down in 3d as @xcite ( 2n_f ) ( n_f)(n_f ) .",

    "the dotted line is an approximation based on expanding the effective potential to sixth order in @xmath17 and demanding it to have the form @xmath168 note that the scale has been magnified to show just the vicinity of the critical line . ]",
    "the critical line ( [ critline ] ) has an interpretation in terms of a weakly interacting bose gas , as in the @xmath169 dimensional case studied in @xcite , where the diquark phase was argued to be a bose condensate .",
    "the fact that the same structure appears in our @xmath170 dimensional model is quite interesting , as bose condensation is rather different in two spatial dimensions .",
    "so we show here explicitly how the usual bose gas results are consistent with the landau - ginzburg effective lagrangian approach of this paper .",
    "recall that for a free relativistic bose gas in @xmath171 spatial dimensions , the charge density is given by @xcite @xmath172 .",

    "the @xmath59 excitations have baryon charge @xmath175 , so we should replace the chemical potential in ( [ rhod],[g2 ] ) by @xmath176 , and the charge density in ( [ rhod ] ) by @xmath177 . at low temperature the lightest modes , the @xmath59 modes , dominate .",
    "there are @xmath80 such modes , where we recall that the number of flavors is @xmath178 .",
    "furthermore , at low temperature only the particles contribute and so we expect @xmath179 in the landau - ginzburg approach discussed in the previous section , the critical line separating the normal and diquark phases is determined by the vanishing of the coefficient @xmath157 of the term quadratic in the order parameter @xmath17 in the expansion of the free energy ( [ lgexp ] ) . at one - loop , the vanishing of @xmath157 in ( [ c2exact ] ) near the critical point @xmath180 can be written as [ here we use slightly less restrictive approximations than were used in obtaining ( [ critline ] ) ] @xmath181\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{n t^2}{32\\pi f^2}\\ , g_2\\left(\\frac{m}{t},\\frac{2\\mu_b}{m}\\right ) .",

    "this is because only half of the @xmath59 modes contribute to the low @xmath1 bose gas , and so only they should be selected out of the general @xmath183 field in this limit . ]",
    "@xmath184 where the coefficients are fixed by the symmetries . since the baryon number chemical potential is @xmath185 we see that the relation ( [ nmu ] ) follows directly .",
    "this demonstrates the consistency of the landau - ginzburg effective lagrangian approach with the standard bose gas results , and shows that the critical line separating the normal and diquark phases describes a free bose gas in two spatial dimensions .",
    "in this paper we have used the low energy effective field theory method at finite temperature and finite baryon density to investigate the phase structure of three dimensional parity invariant su(2 ) qcd with fundamental quarks .",
    "we computed the one - loop effective potential at both @xmath4 and finite @xmath1 , at nonvanishing baryon number chemical potential . at @xmath4 ,",
    "the tree - level critical point @xmath142 between the normal and diquark phase receives a finite shift at one - loop , but this shift corresponds exactly to the mass renormalization , so that at one - loop the @xmath4 critical point is @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the one - loop renormalized pion mass . at nonzero temperature",
    "we found a simple expression ( [ omega ] ) for the effective potential , suitable for a landau - ginzburg analysis in terms of the order parameter @xmath17 which describes the rotation of the tree - level vacuum away from the normal phase vacuum alignment .",
    "the subsequent landau - ginzburg analysis of this free energy revealed a critical line in the @xmath186 plane , given approximately by ( [ critline ] ) .",
    "this line separates the normal and diquark phases , and ends in a tricritical point whose location is given approximately by ( [ tricritpoint ] ) .",
    "this general structure , with a critical line ending in a tricritical point , is qualitatively similar to that found in the 4d case @xcite , except that the @xmath187 temperature dependence for the critical line in ( [ critline ] ) becomes a power law @xmath188 in the 4d case .",
    "however , the details of the 3d phase diagram are much less clear than in the 4d case , due to the presence of infrared divergences , which become more pronounced at higher loops , where they will appear as powers . in a restricted region of the relevant coupling and parameters ( such as @xmath161 , @xmath189 and @xmath190 ) ,",
    "the one - loop effective potential does describe the correct physics .",
    "the one - loop calculation indicates that some transition happens in the vicinity of the critical line ( [ critline ] ) , and the one - loop landau - ginzburg analysis suggests that this is a line of second - order phase transitions , as is the case in 4d @xcite .",
    "however , in 3d there are infrared divergences as @xmath190 tends to zero ( @xmath191 ) , which become more significant at higher loops .",
    "this suggests that a nonperturbative analysis may be necessary to identify the true nature of the phase transition .",
    "there is another reason to think that in the 3d case the critical line may not be one of second - order phase transitions : in two spatial dimensions , only truly massless modes bose condense  massive modes , no matter how light , do not bose condense @xcite . if the @xmath97 modes are truly massless even at nonzero temperature , we would expect to be able to dimensionally reduce the system to two dimensions , in which case the mermin - wagner - coleman theorem tells us that a continuous symmetry can not be broken ( in the absence of long - range interactions ) .",
    "what then is the fate of the diquark phase at nonzero @xmath1 ?",
    "perhaps nonperturbative effects generate an exponentially small , @xmath192 ( rather than actually zero ) , mass for the modes ( which at tree level are exactly massless ) , and the critical line is actually a cross - over between a normal and diquark phase , until the tricritical point is reached , after which it presumably becomes a line of first - order transitions .",
    "we mention that such a nonperturbative exponentially small mass has been observed in the thermodynamics of the large @xmath193 @xmath194 sigma model in 3d @xcite .",
    "this would mean that the standard perturbative effective potential approach to two - color qcd in 3d is good for describing the physics on some portion of the critical line where it is a noninteracting bose gas , but away from this region the perturbative analysis is insufficient .",
    "it would be very interesting to investigate the relevant nonperturbative effects , perhaps from a large @xmath5 analysis , or from a lattice study of 3d two - color qcd .",
    "we thank a. kovner , v. miransky , i. shovkovy , k. splittorff and j. verbaarschot for helpful discussions .",
    "we also thank the u.s .",
    "doe for support through the grant de - fg02 - 92er40716 .",
    "in this appendix we perform the one - loop renormalization of the pion mass and wave function . as the theory is renormalizable at each order of the chiral perturbation , renormalization constants are common for both normal and diquark phase .",
    "thus we shall concentrate on the simpler case of the normal phase , and set @xmath195 as mentioned in section iv.a .",
    "we substitute ( [ sigmas ] ) at @xmath196 into the tree - level term of ( [ l ] ) and expand in @xmath58 and @xmath59 fields up to the quartic order .",
    "we write p_ab=^(1)_ab + i ^(2)_ab ,  q_ab=^(3)_ab + i ^(4)_ab ,  a , b=1,  ,n . without loss of generality",

    "there exist vertices of the form @xmath199 , but they do not contribute to @xmath200 .",
