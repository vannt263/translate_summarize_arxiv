    "this value seems to be in excellent agreement with the meteoritic abundance @xmath0(li ) = 3.26@xmath80.05 ( asplund et al .",

    "note that the li abundance @xmath0(li ) here and subsequently is given on the standard logarithmic scale , where the hydrogen abundance is @xmath0(h ) = 12.00 .",
    "the lithium abundance is known mainly for f- and later type stars , where li  i lines ( mostly the resonance doublet at 6708   ) can be observed .",
    "( sometimes the li  i 6708 line is observed in spectra of magnetic ap - stars with an enhanced li content . ) for f , g and k dwarfs a correlation exists between @xmath0(li ) and the effective temperature @xmath9 : the li abundance tends to decrease with decreasing @xmath9 . in particular ,",
    "lithium depletion is reliably established for the sun , namely @xmath10(li ) = 1.05@xmath80.10 according to asplund et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and 1.03@xmath80.03 according to caffau et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , but the meteoritic abundance is 3.26 , so there is a li depletion by @xmath11 2 dex . the lower @xmath0(li ) in atmospheres of the sun and other cool dwarfs is attributed principally to lithium destruction during the main sequence ( ms ) evolutionary phase .",
    "surface li depletion for stars with masses @xmath6 1.2 m@xmath1 can start in the pre - ms phase ( see , e.g. , maeder 2009 , sec .",
    "20.7 ) .",
    "the observed li abundances in atmospheres of f- and g - type supergiants and giants , the stars of interest here , show a large scatter from star to star .",
    "most stars display a significantly lower li content as compared with young stars ; moreover , the li  i 6708 line is often not seen , so only an upper limit to @xmath0(li ) can be evaluated ( see , e.g. , the early study of luck 1977 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "there are a few f , g and k supergiants and giants with rather high lithium abundances @xmath0(li ) @xmath7 2 - 4 . following some authors",
    ", we shall use the name li - rich for stars with @xmath0(li ) @xmath5 2.0 .    as is well known , the accuracy of two fundamental stellar parameters , namely the effective temperature @xmath9 and surface gravity @xmath12 , plays an important role in the precision of an abundance analysis .",
    "recently , we determined accurate fundamental parameters for 63 galactic a- , f- and g - type supergiants and bright giants ( i.e. , luminosity classes i and ii ) of masses about three solar masses or greater , including @xmath9 , @xmath12 and the iron abundance @xmath0(fe ) ( lyubimkov et al . 2010 , hereinafter paper i ) .",
    "a significant improvement in the accuracy of the @xmath12 values was obtained through application of van leeuwen s ( 2007 ) new reduction of the hipparcos parallaxes ( see lyubimkov et al .",
    "2009 and paper i for details ) .",
    "we found that the typical error in our @xmath12 values is @xmath80.06 dex for stars with distances @xmath13 300 pc and @xmath80.12 dex for stars with @xmath14 between 300 and 700 pc . for",
    "more distant supergiants with @xmath15 700 pc , where parallaxes are uncertain or unknown , the typical errors in @xmath12 are 0.2 - 0.3 dex . in order to check the derived @xmath9 values , a comparison with results inferred with the infrared flux method was used ; the mean error of @xmath8120  k in @xmath9 for stars with @xmath13 700 pc was found .    using these new stellar parameters , we determined the nitrogen abundance in the atmospheres of 30 galactic a and f supergiants ( lyubimkov et al .",
    "we confirmed the surface n enrichment previously reported for such supergiants and showed that rotationally - induced mixing during the main sequence ( ms ) evolutionary phase can play an important role in this enrichment .",
    "the mixing leads to the transfer of the cno - cycled material , i.e. , he , c , n and o , from the stellar interior to the surface .",
    "apart from the observed n enrichment and associated c deficiency in atmospheres of a , f and g supergiants , a lithium deficiency may confirm the mixing . according to theory , li depletion ( also , be and b depletion ) due to the mixing in the ms phase can be very strong ( heger & langer 2000 ; frischknecht et al .",
    "moreover , one anticipates that significant li depletions may occur , even when marked changes in the surface n and c abundances are absent ( e.g. , for stars with relatively low masses and/or low rotational velocities ) .",
    "therefore , li is a more sensitive indicator of the mixing than elements of the cno - cycle .",
    "thus , using the new parameters @xmath9 and @xmath12 , we analyzed the li abundance for 43 f- and g - type supergiants and bright giants . in section 2",
    "we describe observations and selection of programme stars . in section 3",
    "we discuss computations of li i lines , as well as synthetic spectra in the region of the li i 6708   resonance doublet , which is a principal source of the li abundance derivation .",
    "calculations of the model atmospheres are described there , too . in section 4",
    "we present in detail the li abundance determination , which is based on a comparison of observed and synthetic spectra in the region of the li i 6708   line .",

    "we compare the derived li abundances with other published data .",

    "the masses of li - rich stars are of special interest there . in section 9",
    "we compare the derived li abundances with recent theoretical predictions .",

    "one may see that the extreme mass is @xmath2 = 5.3 m@xmath1 ; the total @xmath2 range spreads from 1.0 to 5.3 m@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , according to table  4 , all known li - rich stars have masses @xmath6  6  m@xmath1 . in other words ,",
    "the li - rich giants and supergiants are the relatively low - mass objects .",
    "it was mentioned above that lithium is a much more sensitive indicator of rotational mixing than elements of participating in the cno - cycles .",

    "recently , frischknecht et al .",
    "( 2010 ) performed computations of 9 , 12 and 15 m@xmath1 stellar models with rotational mixing and confirmed that the surface li abundance decreases strongly during the ms phase .",
    "recently ekstrm et al .",
    "( 2012 ) enlarged significantly the mass range of rotational stellar models by computing models with @xmath2 from 0.8 to 120 m@xmath1 .",
    "unfortunately , no predictions for the li surface abundance are presented in this first of an expected series of papers .    at our request ,",
    "urs frischknecht extended computations to models with lower masses down to @xmath2 = 2 m@xmath1 .",
    "an initial lithium abundance @xmath0(@xmath20li ) = 3.25 was adopted in the model computations .",
    "it is necessary to note that the first dredge - up ( fd ) phase is computed only partially in his models for masses @xmath2 = 7 - 15 m@xmath1 ; the red - blue loops , which are pronounced for such masses , were not considered .",
    "we may compare our results with these new theoretical predictions ( frischknecht et al .",

    "open rhombi on the 2 , 3 and 5 m@xmath1 tracks mark the beginning of the surface li depletion in the fd phase .",
    "open stars on the 7 - 15 m@xmath1 tracks mark the post - ms moments when a great drop in @xmath0(li ) occurs .",
    "dotted vertical line at @xmath9 = 7000  k separates the region of f and g supergiants from the region of a supergiants.,width=313 ]    a set of frischknecht s evolutionary tracks for non - rotating 2 - 15 m@xmath1 models is presented in fig.8 .",
    "these tracks are shown from the zams to helium ignition and , hence , the red - blue loops for helium burning are absent ( compare tracks in figs 6 and 8) .",
    "the dotted vertical line in fig.8 corresponds to the effective temperature of 7000  k , the approximate boundary between a- and f - type supergiants .",
    "we found that stellar masses @xmath2 inferred from these new tracks are close to the masses derived from claret s ( also non - rotating ) tracks ( fig.6 ) .",
    "in particular , the difference in @xmath2 is imperceptible for stars with @xmath21  2  m@xmath1 ; the @xmath2 increment is larger for stars with @xmath22 5 - 11 m@xmath1 , namely it is about 8 - 11 per cent or comparable with the mean error of 8 per cent in the masses @xmath2 in table  1 .",
    "insignificant differences in @xmath2 were obtained , when comparing masses derived from rotating and non - rotating models .",
    "we found that frischknecht s tracks computed for the initial rotational velocities",
    "@xmath18 = 0 km s@xmath19 and 200 km s@xmath19 are rather close .",
    "substitution of @xmath18 = 0 km s@xmath19 for 200 km s@xmath19 leads to a decrease of @xmath2 by 0.1 m@xmath1 for a star with @xmath2  =  7.9  m@xmath1 and by 0.3 m@xmath1 for a star with @xmath2  =  11.0  m@xmath1 .",
    "thus , changes in @xmath2 are smaller than errors in the @xmath2 determinations . therefore , use of models with the rapid initial rotation can not lead to a marked decrease of the masses @xmath2 .    stellar models with the initial rotational velocity @xmath18 = 0 km  s@xmath19 do not show any changes in the surface li abundance during the ms phase .",
    "the changes appear later ; according to frischknecht s computations for non - rotating models , ( i ) if @xmath23  6  m@xmath1 the surface li abundance begins to decrease when a star enters the fd phase ; onset of this decrement is marked in fig.8 by open rhombi on the 2 , 3 , and 5 m@xmath1 tracks ( changes in the c and n surface abundances begin later , on the ascending branch of the tracks ) ; ( ii ) if @xmath4  6  m@xmath1 strong li depletion appears much earlier ; these moments are marked by open stars on the 7 , 9 , 12 and 15 m@xmath1 tracks .",
    "therefore , both our finding ( fig.7 ) and recent theoretical predictions show that the stars studied can be divided into two groups depending on the mass @xmath2 , namely the stars with @xmath23  6  m@xmath1 and the stars with @xmath4  6  m@xmath1 .",
    "next , we discuss a comparison with the theoretical predictions for these two groups separately .",
    "all li - rich stars are found to be in this @xmath2 region .",
    "it is interesting that the li - rich giants hd 17905 and hr 7008 have the li abundances that are virtually equal to the initial abundance @xmath0(li ) = 3.2@xmath80.1 .",
    "a simple explanation of this fact arises , if one supposes that during the ms phase these stars had very slow rotation ; they have not reached the fd phase ( figs 6 and 8) and , therefore , have conserved the initial li abundance .",
    "the evolutionary status of the three li - rich giants from table  1 is clear from fig.8 ( they are marked there ) .",
    "the stars hd  17905 and hr  7008 are observed prior to reaching the fd phase , whereas the star hr  3102 is closer to it .",
    "can the li - rich giants hd  17905 and hr  7008 conserve their initial lithium abundance @xmath0(li ) @xmath7 3.2 ( the simplest explanation of their high li abundances ) ? this would be possible , if their initial rotational velocities @xmath18 were close to zero .",
    "however , we found that these stars have currently rather high rotational velocities , namely @xmath24 = 53 and 58 km  s@xmath19 , respectively ( for the third li - rich star , hr  3102 , we found @xmath24 = 12 km  s@xmath19 ) .",
    "it is known that when a b - type star terminates the ms phase and passes into the afg supergiant phase , its rotational velocity decreases significantly .",
    "so , at the beginning of the ms phase , when the f - type giants hd  17905 and hr  7008 were b - type dwarfs , their rotational velocities should have been markedly greater",
    ". one may expect that the stars had then @xmath25 100 km  s@xmath19 ( see , e.g. , abt , levato & grosso 2002 ) . but stars with @xmath25 100 km  s@xmath19 are predicted to decrease significantly their surface li abundances by the end of the ms phase ( see below ) .",
    "then one must ask : why has li retained its initial value for hd  17905 and hr  7008 ?",
    "are the predictions for rotationally - induced mixing in error ?",
    "are we observing freshly - made li ?",
    "accurate determinations of c , n , and o abundances would be valuable here .    the third li - rich star , the giant hr  3102 with @xmath0(li ) = 2.3 , is of special interest because it is the only star in table  1 for which the nitrogen abundance was obtained by lyubimkov et al .",
    "specifically , a nitrogen excess [ n / fe ] = 0.41 was found for it .",
    "( other stars in the cited work were generally hotter than stars in the present work , i.e. , li could not be measured in these stars for which n was measured . ) according to lyubimkov et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , one may consider two possible explanations for this n excess .",
    "first , the star with an initial high rotational velocity @xmath26 200 km  s@xmath19 is now a post - ms object but has not yet reached the fd phase .",
    "however , frischknecht s computations show that in this case the star should have very low , undetectable li abundance .",
    "second , the n excess would appear if the star had slow rotation on the zams ( e.g. , @xmath26 50 km / s ; currently its observed velocity is @xmath24 = 12 km / s ) and now is close to the fd phase termination . but in this case theory again predicts a li abundance that is much less than the observed value @xmath0(li ) = 2.3 .",
    "moreover , as seen from fig.6 , this 5.1 m@xmath1 star has not reached the fd phase .",
    "thus , the observed data on the n and li abundances can not be explained by current theory .",
    "therefore , it appears that this li - rich bright giant hr  3102 may have freshly - produced lithium at the surface .    in table  3",
    "there are three more li - rich bright giants , namely hr 1135 , hr 1644 and hr 6707 , with the lithium abundances @xmath0(li ) = 2.2 , 2.4 and 2.0 , respectively .",
    "their positions in fig.8 show that they have not yet reached the fd phase . for one of these stars , namely hr 1135",
    "( f3 ii ) , the projected rotational velocity is known : @xmath24 = 49 km / s ( table  3 ) .",
    "one may expect that the initial rotational velocity of the star @xmath18 was significantly greater ; so we have in this case the same situation as for the above li - rich giants hd 17905 and hr 7008 .",
    "since stellar models with rapid rotation predict a strong li depletion by the end of the ms phase , one may suppose for this star , like hd 17905 and hr 7008 , a presence of freshly - produced lithium .",
    "four li - rich giants from table  3 ( lower part ) are interesting , because they have similar low masses @xmath22  2  m@xmath1 and , simultaneously , the similar li abundances @xmath0(li ) = 2.3 - 2.9",
    ". these giants are form a compact group in figs 6 , 7 and 8 .",
    "one sees from table  3 that their projected rotational velocities are @xmath24 = 27 - 66 km  s@xmath19 , i.e. @xmath11 50 km  s@xmath19 on average .",
    "they all are post - ms objects but have not reached the fd - phase ( fig.8 ) .",
    "frischknecht s computations for a 2 m@xmath1 model with the initial rotational velocity @xmath26 50 km  s@xmath19 predict the li abundance @xmath0(li ) @xmath11 2.6 just after the ms phase .",
    "this value is in excellent agreement with the observed li abundances for these giants .",
    "therefore , their enhanced li abundance is appears explainable .",
    "however , if , as seems likely , rotational velocities on zams were significantly greater than current values , one may have to suppose the presence of freshly - produced lithium",
    ". this supposition would be confirmed , if , as for hr 3102 , a nitrogen excess was found for these giants .    by the fd termination",
    ", the models with @xmath18 = 0 km  s@xmath19 predict the surface li abundance to fall in a narrow range from @xmath0(li ) = 1.46 at @xmath2 = 2 m@xmath1 to @xmath0(li ) = 1.37 at @xmath2 = 6  m@xmath1 .",
    "this relation between @xmath0(li ) and @xmath2 is shown by the solid thick line in fig.7 .",
    "the mean predicted abundance is @xmath0(li ) = 1.4 which is equal to the mean observed @xmath0(li ) value for eleven stars with @xmath0(li ) = 1.1 to 1.8 ( six stars from table  1 , filled squares in fig.7 , and five stars from table  3 , crosses in fig.7 ) .",
    "thus , we arrive at the conclusion that these eleven stars can be explained as post - fd objects ( or objects well into the fd phase ) that had small rotational velocities on the zams",
    ". positions of these stars in fig.8 confirm that they are in the fd phase ( some may be on a red - blue loop ) .",
    "their current rotational velocities are very low ( @xmath27 5 km / s , see table  3 ) thus , for 11 stars of our sample the initial rotational velocity is expected to be very small ( @xmath26 0 km / s ) .",
    "this fact leads to the conclusion that a substantial fraction of b dwarfs , progenitors of f and g supergiants and bright giants , have low rotational velocities @xmath18 that are close to zero .    in the case of 2 - 6  m@xmath1 models with rotation , substantial lithium depletion in the atmospheres",
    "occurs already in the ms phase and continues during the fd phase .",
    "we show in fig.7 by the dashed line the predicted post - fd surface abundances for 2 - 6  m@xmath1 models with the initial rotational velocity of @xmath18 = 50 km  s@xmath19 .",
    "one sees that the li abundance decreases from @xmath0(li ) = 0.92 at @xmath2 = 2 m@xmath1 to @xmath0(li ) = 0.39 at @xmath2 = 6  m@xmath1 .",
    "it is hardly possible to detect such low abundances .",
    "when @xmath18 = 100 km  s@xmath19 , the theory predicts severe li depletion already at ms termination , specifically from @xmath0(li ) = 0.80 at @xmath2 = 2 m@xmath1 to @xmath0(li ) = -0.85 at @xmath2 = 6  m@xmath1 . during the fd phase a further strengthening of li depletion occurs .",
    "therefore , most of our 2 - 6  m@xmath1 stars with li upper limits ( open circles in figs 7 and 8) can be explained as post - fd objects with @xmath28 50 km  s@xmath19 or post - ms and post - fd objects with @xmath25 100 km  s@xmath19 .",
    "one sees that two open circles ( li abundance upper limits ) in fig.7 lie higher than the post - fd predictions ( solid line at @xmath0(li ) @xmath7 1.4 ) ; they correspond to the f stars hr  7542 and hr  7834 , both with a mass @xmath2 = 5.3 m@xmath1 .",
    "their high upper li limits ( higher than li limits for other stars of this group ) can be explained by difficulties in detecting the li  i 6708 line . in particular , the spectrum of hr  7542 is markedly smoothed due to the rotational velocity @xmath24 = 25 km  s@xmath19 .",
    "a weak asymmetric blend observed at 6708    may be partially due to the li  i line , but the appreciable contribution of nearby fe i and si i lines does not allow us to estimate reliably the @xmath0(li ) value . as far as hr  7834 is concerned , its high li upper limit is related to its rather high effective temperature @xmath9 = 6570  k ( see fig.5 ) .",
    "positions of both stars in fig.8 show that they have not reached the fd phase .",
    "the bright giant hr  7834 may be a post - ms object with , e.g. , @xmath18 = 100 km  s@xmath19 and with the predicted surface abundance @xmath0(li ) = -0.7 ( the post - ms theoretical value interpolated to @xmath18 = 100 km  s@xmath19 for the mass @xmath2 = 5.3 m@xmath1 ) .",
    "the supergiant hr  7542 has currently the relatively high rotational velocity @xmath24 = 25 km  s@xmath19 ; its initial velocity @xmath18 was significantly greater .",
    "if its li upper limit 1.5 is close to the actual li abundance , one may suppose for this star the same scenario as for the hr  1135 ( see above ) , i.e. an appearance of freshly - produced lithium .",
    "in contrast to the preceding group , the derived li abundances for stars with @xmath4  6  m@xmath1 display less variety .",
    "one may see from fig.7 that li - rich stars are absent in the @xmath2 region from 6 to 15 m@xmath1 . as mentioned above",
    ", data of other authors confirm that there are no li - rich stars with @xmath4  6  m@xmath1 .",
    "next , only two stars , namely hr  461 and hr  8313 ( marked in fig.7 ) , have detectable @xmath0(li ) values . in all other stars of this group lithium",
    "is not seen .",
    "as far as the theoretical predictions on li depletion are concerned , a dramatic difference takes place for the non - rotating ( @xmath18 = 0 km  s@xmath19 ) models with masses @xmath2 = 7 - 15 m@xmath1 in comparison with the 2 - 6  m@xmath1 models .",
    "although the non - rotating 7 - 15 m@xmath1 models , like similar 2 - 6  m@xmath1 models , do not show any changes in the surface @xmath0(li ) value during the ms phase , a deep and precipitate drop in @xmath0(li ) by 4 - 6 dex occurs shortly after the ms termination ( its value is dependent on @xmath2 ) .",
    "we mark in fig.8 these very short moments by open stars on the 7 - 15 m@xmath1 tracks .",
    "( according to the model computations , the drop is absent at @xmath2 = 6 m@xmath1 , but exists at @xmath2 = 7 m@xmath1 ) .",
    "these abrupt changes in @xmath0(li ) occupy a very narrow range of effective temperatures in fig.8 , namely from @xmath9 = 15820  k at @xmath2 = 7 m@xmath1 to @xmath9 = 15700  k at @xmath2 = 15 m@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , a great drop in @xmath0(li ) occurs , when a star is observed as a b - type giant , i.e. when it is rather far from the f and g supergiant region where @xmath29 7000  k. moving along the track , such a star comes to the f and g supergiant region with a very low , undetectable li abundance .",
    "one may suppose that the abrupt drop of the surface li abundance arises from short - lived mixing ( unrelated to rotation ) of the outer layers , and , therefore , leads to the lithium destruction but does not affect other chemical elements .",
    "the 7 - 15 m@xmath1 models with rotation predict significant li depletion already at the ms phase termination .",
    "for instance , for the models with @xmath28 100 km  s@xmath19 the surface abundance @xmath0(li ) at the end of the ms varies from -0.9 for @xmath2 = 7 m@xmath1 to -4.3 for @xmath2 = 15 m@xmath1 ; for the models with @xmath28 200 km  s@xmath19 this value varies from -5.7 to -6.8 , respectively .",
    "further lithium deficiency occurs when a star is evolving from a b giant to an f and g supergiant and , next , when it enters into the fd phase .",
    "therefore , from the viewpoint of frischknecht s computations , f and g supergiants and bright giants with detectable li abundance should not be observed in the 7 - 15 m@xmath1 range .",
    "however , there are two stars in the 7 - 15 m@xmath1 range , namely hr  461 and hr  8313 ( marked in fig.7 ) , with a definite @xmath0(li ) value .",
    "it is necessary to consider these stars in more detail .",
    "the li  i 6707.8 line is clearly seen in spectra of both stars ( see , e.g. , fig.1 for hr  8313 ) .",
    "the non - lte lithium abundances of hr 461 and hr 8313 ( table  1 ) agree very well with the mean post - fd predicted abundance @xmath0(li ) = 1.4 for non - rotating models with @xmath30  6  m@xmath1 ( thick solid line in fig.7 ) , as well as with the mean observed @xmath0(li ) value for the 11 stars in the less massive group discussed above ( six filled squares and five crosses ) .",
    "our @xmath0(li ) values for the stars hr  461 and hr  8313 show good agreement with data of other authors .",
    "in particular , luck & wepfer ( 1995 ) derived the lte abundance @xmath0(li ) = 0.92 for hr  461 , which agrees very well with our lte value 0.89 for this star ( table  1 ) .",
    "luck ( 1977 ) obtained the non - lte abundance @xmath0(li ) = 1.49 for hr  8313 that is in excellent accordance with our value 1.53 .",
    "masses of the stars hr  461 and hr  8313 were found to be @xmath2 = 9.5@xmath81.2 and 7.1@xmath80.4 m@xmath1 , respectively ( paper i ) .",
    "when determining the masses , we took our @xmath9 and @xmath12 and used claret s ( 2004 ) evolutionary tracks , which have been computed with no rotational mixing in the ms phase .",
    "( note that errors in the @xmath2 values in paper i were estimated from uncertainties in @xmath9 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "when masses are derived from the new frischknecht s tracks presented in fig.8 , we obtain the slightly increased @xmath2 values , namely 10.6  m@xmath1 for hr  461 and 7.9 m@xmath1 for hr  8313 .",
    "although it is difficult to suppose that the derived masses @xmath2 for the stars hr  461 and hr  8313 contain gross errors , the theoretical predictions are such that cool giants and supergiants with @xmath4  6  m@xmath1 can not display a detectable li abundance ( this is possible only for stars with @xmath23  6  m@xmath1 ) . therefore , one may suggest two hypotheses as follows :    \\(i ) lithium observed in the atmospheres of the stars hr  461 and hr  8313 was produced recently , e.g. , during the fd phase .",
    "one sees from fig.8 that both stars are in the fd phase or , maybe , close to its termination ( if they are on the red - blue loops ) .",
    "note in this connection that the g - type supergiant hr  8313 shows the carbon isotope ratio @xmath31c/@xmath32c = 34 ( see below ) , which is typical for stars coming to the fd s end .",
    "\\(ii ) the prediction of the non - rotating models with @xmath4  6  m@xmath1 that a great drop in @xmath0(li ) occurs shortly after the ms phase is incorrect , but rather stars with @xmath2 = 7 - 10 m@xmath1 and @xmath26 0 km  s@xmath19 , like similar 2 - 6  m@xmath1 stars , have the post - fd lithium abundance about @xmath0(li ) = 1.4 . in this case",
    "the stars hr  461 and hr  8313 form in fig.7 a common sequence with the six stars of lower masses @xmath6  6  m@xmath1 ( filled squares ) .",
    "one may suppose that all these stars passed through the fd phase and , therefore , received the li depletion that is typical for the post - fd phase .",
    "the predicted li abundance is rather sensitive to details of stellar model computations .",
    "comparison of frischknecht s results with earlier computations of heger & langer ( 2000 ) for models of rotating stars with masses @xmath2 = 12 and 15 m@xmath1 confirms this supposition .",
    "in fact , when comparing data from these two sources obtained for initial rotational velocities @xmath18 = 100 and 200 km  s@xmath19 , we found that frischknecht s models predict much larger reductions in @xmath0(li ) at the ms termination than heger & langer s ones ( the difference is about 2 - 4 dex ) . note that a significant difference is also found by frischknecht et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for boron depletion .",
    "frischknecht et al .",
    "( 2010 ) noted that uncertainties in the theory are still quite large .",
    "therefore , further theoretical efforts are necessary in order to explain all data on the lithium depletion in post - ms and post - fd stars and , in particular , to confirm ( or not ) the predicted great drop in @xmath0(li ) shortly after the ms phase in the non - rotating 7 - 15 m@xmath1 models .",
    "our analysis , as well as theoretical predictions shows that the surface li abundances in f and g supergiants and giants depend strongly on their initial rotational velocities @xmath18 . what actual @xmath18 values can be expected for such stars ?",
    "in particular , can supergiants with the very low values @xmath26 0",
    "km  s@xmath19 exist ?",
    "progenitors of the 3 - 15 m@xmath1 supergiants are b - type ms stars , whereas the 2 m@xmath1 supergiants progenitors are a - type ms stars .",
    "abt , levato & grosso s ( 2002 ) analysis of observed rotational velocities of b - type ms stars led to interesting conclusions on the @xmath18 values . according to their results ,",
    "there is a rather large number of b - type ms stars with low initial velocities @xmath26 50 km  s@xmath19 . in particular , for b0-b2 subtypes the fraction of stars with @xmath18 = 50 km  s@xmath19 is greater than the fraction with @xmath18 = 100 or 200 km  s@xmath19 , whereas for b6-b7 subtypes the number of stars with @xmath18 = 50 km  s@xmath19 is comparable with the number of stars with @xmath18 = 200 km  s@xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the existence of f and g supergiants and giants both with the relatively small initial values @xmath26 50 km  s@xmath19 and with the relatively large values @xmath25 100 km  s@xmath19 is possible .",
    "moreover , since for 11 stars with @xmath0(li ) @xmath11 1.4 and @xmath6  6  m@xmath1 ( 6 filled squares and 5 crosses in fig.7 ) the values @xmath26 0 km  s@xmath19 are expected ( see above ) , the fraction of stars with very low initial velocities @xmath18 is substantial , too .",
    "recently huang , gies and mcswain ( 2010 ) determined and analysed rotational velocities for a large sample ( @xmath111000 ) of b - type ms stars .",
    "they considered evolution of rotation of the stars during the ms phase ( from zams to tams ) .",
    "it was concluded that about 6 per cent of newborn b stars are very slow rotators , i.e. they have the ratio @xmath33 0.1 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are equatorial and critical rotational velocities , respectively .",
    "however , the distribution of the stars with @xmath36 seems to depend strongly on stellar mass @xmath2 , so as the mass @xmath2 increases , more and more stars are born as slow rotators .",
    "the fraction of slow rotators is relatively small for newborn b stars with @xmath2 = 2 - 4 m@xmath1 , but is large for the stars with @xmath4 8 m@xmath1 .",
    "in particular , about 84 per cent of the stars with @xmath4 8 m@xmath1 show the initial ratio @xmath33 0.5 and a significant part of them have @xmath33 0.2 ( see fig.7 in the work cited ) .",
    "therefore , huang , gies and mcswain s analysis confirms that progenitors of f and g supergiants and bright giants could have the rotational velocity distribution needed to account for the distribution of li abundances with mass .",
    "computations of stellar evolutionary models show that lithium is a very sensitive indicator of stellar evolution . during evolution of a star from the main sequence ( ms ) to the f and",
    "g supergiant phase , lithium may be destroyed by , for example , the rotationally - induced mixing in the ms phase and strongly diluted by development of the supergiant s convective envelope ( the first dredge - up , fd ) .",
    "the strong dilution of the surface li abundance in rotational models by the ms phase termination and then during the fd phase is predicted , e.g. , by computations of heger and langer ( 2000 ) and frischknecht et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .    observed lithium abundances in f and g supergiants and giants support the idea that there is a boundary at @xmath22  6  m@xmath1 that divides these stars into two groups . in particular , all known li - rich giants and supergiants seem to be stars with masses @xmath6  6  m@xmath1 ; there are no li - rich stars with @xmath4  6  m@xmath1 .",
    "this conclusion follows not only from our work but also from a scrutiny of published data .",
    "a division of the stars into two groups with @xmath23  6  m@xmath1 and @xmath4  6  m@xmath1 is suggested as well by the recent frischknecht s computations ( priv .",
    "comm . ) of stellar models with masses from 2 to 15 m@xmath1 .",
    "most of the stars studied do not show lithium in their spectra .",
    "low lithium abundances in their atmospheres are explained by the strong li depletion during the star s evolution ; a few possibilities can be suggested :    \\(i ) in stars with masses @xmath4  6  m@xmath1 and very slow rotation ( @xmath26 0 km  s@xmath19 ) a great drop in @xmath0(li ) is predicted to occur shortly after the ms phase , such that stars come to the f and g supergiant phase with a strong li deficiency . in rotating stars with @xmath4  6  m@xmath1",
    "the great li deficiency appears already by the ms phase termination , according to frischknecht ; the deficiency increases when a star passes through the fd phase .",
    "so , from the viewpoint of these theoretical predictions , f and g supergiants and bright giants with @xmath4  6  m@xmath1 can not display a detectable li abundance .",
    "\\(ii ) in stars having masses @xmath23  6  m@xmath1 and initial rotational velocities @xmath25 100 km  s@xmath19 the significant li depletion is predicted to appear by the end of the ms phase .",
    "when these stars become f and g supergiants and giants , li is predicted to be undetectable .",
    "the li abundance becomes too low as well for stars with @xmath26 50 km  s@xmath19 , when they terminate the fd phase .",
    "there are altogether 23 stars ( of 55 studied ) with detectable li abundances , namely 11 stars in our basic list ( table  1 ) and 12 stars in the additional list ( table  3 ) . for eleven of these stars with masses @xmath6  6",
    "m@xmath1 we found @xmath0(li ) in a rather narrow range from 1.1 to 1.8 ( the average is 1.4 ) .",
    "these li abundances agree very well with the mean predicted value @xmath0(li ) = 1.4 for the post - fd non - rotating 2 - 6 m@xmath1 models .",
    "so , these 11 stars can be explained as the post - fd 2 - 6 m@xmath1 objects with the very slow initial rotation ( @xmath26 0 km / s ) .",
    "we studied 10 li - rich stars ( 3 in table  1 and 7 in table  3 ) ; their li abundances are @xmath0(li ) = 2.0 - 3.2 .",
    "we found that all li - rich giants and supergiants with @xmath0(li ) @xmath37 2.0 have masses @xmath6  6  m@xmath1 ; this conclusion follows not only from our work but also from a scrutiny of published data .",
    "two li - rich giants in table  1 caught prior to the fd , namely hd  17905 and hr  7008 , have a li abundance that is close to their initial / interstellar value @xmath0(li ) = 3.2 .",
    "theory insists that to have conserved their initial li abundance , their initial rotational velocities @xmath18 must have been about zero .",
    "however , their observed rotational velocities as bright giants are @xmath24 = 50 - 60 km  s@xmath19 and , therefore , the @xmath18 values at the ms beginning are expected to be much greater .",
    "rotating stellar models with @xmath25 100 km  s@xmath19 predict significant li deficiency after the ms phase ; the observed high abundances @xmath0(li ) for hd  17905 and hr  7008 contradict the theory .",
    "the same situation occurs for the bright giant hr  1135 ( f3",
    "ii ) from table  3 with @xmath0(li ) = 2.2 and with the otational velocity @xmath24 = 49 km  s@xmath19 .",
    "therefore , we are forced to assume for these three stars that either the theoretical li deficiency is greatly overestimated or freshly - produced lithium is observed in their atmospheres .",
    "lithium production is likely needed as well for one more li - rich star in our sample , namely hr  3102 ( table  1 ) , because the theory , even for non - rotating stars , can not explain simultaneously its high lithium abundance and substantial nitrogen excess .",
    "there is also in table  3 a compact group of four li - rich giants ( luminosity class iii ) with masses @xmath22 2 m@xmath1 and li abundances",
    "@xmath0(li )  =  2.3 - 2.9 .",
    "the observed @xmath0(li ) values for these four post - ms stars would be in good agreement with the theory , if their current rotational velocities as giants @xmath38 50 km  s@xmath19 do not markedly differ from the initial values @xmath18 on zams .",
    "however , if the @xmath18 values were significantly greater than current velocities , one may suppose again the presence of freshly - produced lithium .",
    "the absolute majority of programme stars with @xmath4  6  m@xmath1 did not show detectable lithium that is in good agreement with frischknecht s predictions . only for two stars with @xmath4  6  m@xmath1 ,",
    "namely hr  461 and hr  8313 , did we find definite @xmath0(li ) values .",
    "present theory can not explain the detectable li abundance in their atmospheres .",
    "two possible solutions of the problem may be suggested .",
    "first , the predictions for non - rotating 7 - 15 m@xmath1 models of a great drop in surface li abundance shortly after the ms phase are invalid . in this case , the stars hr  461 and hr  8313 , like eleven 2 - 6  m@xmath1 stars with @xmath0(li ) @xmath7 1.4 , can be post - fd objects with @xmath26 0 km  s@xmath19 .",
    "second , the theory is valid , but an episode of li production has been overlooked .",
    "evolutionary status of the stars studied would be clearer if additional information was available on abundances of elements and isotopes predicted to be affected by mixing with the interior .",
    "the carbon isotope ratio @xmath31c/@xmath32c is a valuable indicator but requires a c - containing molecule to contribute to the stellar spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , we could find published @xmath31c/@xmath32c values for only two cool supergiants , namely hr  3045 ( @xmath39 pup ) and hr  8313 ( 9  peg ) . according to tomkin , luck and lambert ( 1976 ) , the @xmath31c/@xmath32c ratio is equal to 7 for hr  3045 and 34 for hr  8313 that is much less than the initial ( solar ) ratio @xmath31c/@xmath32c = 89 .",
    "the low @xmath31c/@xmath32c values confirm that both the stars have been through the fd phase ; both are rather massive ( @xmath2 = 9.9 and 7.1 m@xmath1 , respectively ) , so they are likely to be on their red - blue loops .",
    "as follows from frischknecht s computations , the extremely low ratio @xmath31c/@xmath32c = 7 for the post - fd 9 - 15 m@xmath1 stars , like that for hr  3045 , can be explained by evolution with an initial rotational velocity @xmath18 = 150 km  s@xmath19 .",
    "observational insight into the changes in surface abundances of the progenitors of fgk supergiants and giants would be valuable . deep mixing such as",
    "may alter the surface c , n , and o abundances is guaranteed to rid the surface of lithium but lithium ( as explained above ) is not observable in the hot progenitors .",
    "greater exploration of boron in such stars could be very helpful , and beryllium in stars of intermediate temperatures would be valuable too .",
    "boron as b  ii and b  iii is detectable only in the ultraviolet and beryllium as be  ii only at 3130   .",
    "summarising , we may conclude that current theoretical stellar models with and without rotation account fairly well for the observed li abundances in f and g giants and supergiants .",
    "nonetheless , there are cases where the theory may be invalid , namely ( i ) the li - rich giants hd  17905 , hr  7008 , hr  3102 and hr  1135 ( @xmath6  6  m@xmath1 ) , whose high li abundances accompanied with rather large rotational velocities ( hd  17905 , hr  7008 and hr  1135 ) or the substantial nitrogen excess ( hr  3102 ) contradict theoretical predictions ; ( ii ) the relatively high - mass supergiants hr  461 and hr  8313 ( @xmath4  6  m@xmath1 ) with the detectable abundances @xmath0(li ) = 1.3 - 1.5 .",
    "it is possible that recently synthesized lithium is observed in both cases ( i ) and ( ii ) .    in all discussions of lithium synthesis in evolved stars , the same recipe involving nuclear reactions",
    "is invoked : @xmath40he  +  @xmath41be  +  @xmath42 ; @xmath43be  +  e@xmath44li  +  @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath46he is that which was present at the birth of the star and escaped destruction by avoiding mixing with the interior .",
    "( in low - mass stars but not the progenitors of the fgk bright giants and supergiants . additional and fresh @xmath46he is synthesized by the first stages of the pp - chain ) .",
    "if the above recipe is to result in lithium production , it must operate in a convective environment such that @xmath20be and @xmath20li is convected to lower temperatures at which they may avoid destruction by protons .",
    "this pairing of synthesis and a convective environment is known as the cameron - fowler mechanism . in connection with red giants , three sites at which the cameron - fowler mechanism may operate",
    "have been previously proposed : red giants experiencing the bump on the first ascent of the rgb or the he - core flash in low mass red giants ( charbonnel & balachandran 2000 ; kumar et al .",
    "2011 ) , the ascent of the agb following a red - blue loop ( charbonnel & balachandran 2000 ) and finally the hot bottom convective envelope of a luminous agb star ( sackmann & boothroyd 2000 ) . here , the suggestion of lithium production following a red - blue loop might account for lithium in hr  461 and hr  8313 . a new site and/or mechanism seems to be required to account for lithium production in hd  17905 , hr  7008 , hr  3102 and hr  1135 unless present theory overestimates destruction of li by rotationally - induced mechanisms .",
    "extra - mixing associated with a presence of magnetic fields has been suggested , for example ( guandalini et al .",

    "<S> lithium in the atmosphere of a f or g supergiant reflects the initial li abundance and the internal history of the star . during evolution of a star from the main sequence ( ms ) to the supergiant phase , lithium may be destroyed by , for example , rotationally - induced mixing in the ms stars and strongly diluted by development of the supergiant s convective envelope . in order to probe the connection between atmospheric li abundance and evolutionary predictions , we present a non - lte abundance analysis of the resonance doublet li i at 6707.8   for 55 galactic f and g supergiants and bright giants ( we observed 43 of them , the remaining 12 are added from luck and wepfer s list ) . the derived lithium abundances @xmath0(li ) may be considered in three groups , namely : ( i ) ten li - rich giants with @xmath0(li ) = 2.0 to 3.2 ( all ten are f - type or a9 stars ) ; ( ii ) thirteen g- to k0-type stars with li abundances in the narrow range @xmath0(li ) = 1.1 - 1.8 ; ( iii ) all other stars provide just upper limits to the li abundance .    </S>",
    "<S> the derived li abundances are compared with theoretical predictions of 2 to 15 m@xmath1 stars ( both rotating and non - rotating ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results are generally in good agreement with theory . in particular , the absence of detectable lithium for the majority of programme stars is explainable . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison suggests that the stars may be separated by mass @xmath2 into two groups , namely @xmath3  6  m@xmath1 and @xmath4  6  m@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> all li - rich giants and supergiants with @xmath0(li ) @xmath5 2.0 have masses @xmath6  6  m@xmath1 ; this conclusion follows not only from our work but also from a scrutiny of published data . </S>",
    "<S> eleven of thirteen stars with @xmath0(li ) = 1.1 - 1.8 , specifically the stars with @xmath6  6  m@xmath1 , show good agreement with the post - first dredge - up surface abundance @xmath0(li ) @xmath7 1.4 predicted for the non - rotating 2 - 6 m@xmath1 stellar models . </S>",
    "<S> an absence of li - rich stars in the range @xmath4  6  m@xmath1 agrees with the theoretical prediction that f and g supergiants and giants with @xmath4  6  m@xmath1 can not show detectable lithium .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that present theory appears unable to account for the derived li abundances for some stars , namely for ( i ) a few relatively low - mass li - rich giants ( @xmath6  6  m@xmath1 ) , whose high li abundances accompanied by rather high rotational velocities or substantial nitrogen excess contradict theoretical predictions ; ( ii ) the relatively high - mass supergiants hr 461 and hr 8313 ( @xmath4  6  m@xmath1 ) with the detected abundances @xmath0 = 1.3 - 1.5 . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that the lithium in such stars was synthesized recently .    </S>",
