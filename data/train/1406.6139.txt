    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , characterized by the presence of the siii 6355  absorption feature , are believed to be thermonuclear explosions of carbon / oxygen ( c / o ) white dwarf ( wd ) either accreting matter from its companion in a binary system , or merging with another white dwarf @xcite . a majority of these objects , known as ` normal ' type ia sne , @xcite form a remarkably homogeneous class with similar light curve shape and spectral evolution .",
    "the high and uniform peak luminosity makes them powerful distance indicators .",
    "sne ia have been used to measure the cosmic expansion history , leading to the discovery of accelerating universe and existence of dark energy @xcite .",
    "the key fact behind this is that the light curves of normal sne ia can be normalized to a common light curve using empirical relations between light curve width and peak luminosity @xcite .",
    "the observed homogeneity in sne ia is linked with the commonly accepted theory that the explosion of wd occurs at a mass close to the chandrasekhar mass limit @xcite of 1.4 m@xmath10 . however , the detailed explosion mechanism and the nature of progenitors are still under investigation . with the availability of good quality data of sne ia in the recent years , deviation from the observed homogeneity , and the occurrence of peculiar and exceptional events",
    "is quite evident .",
    "a recent study by @xcite has revealed that a majority of sne ia ( @xmath16 70% ) belong to a fairly homogeneous class  ` normal ' type ia , while @xmath16 9% are overluminous ",
    "sn 1991t - like events @xcite , @xmath16 15% are underluminous ",
    "1991bg - like events @xcite and @xmath16 5% are peculiar ",
    "sn 2002cx - like events @xcite .    the discovery of the extremely luminous type ia supernova sn 2003fg ( snls-03d3bb : * ? ?",
    "* ) and the subsequent discoveries of sn 2006gz , sn 2007if and sn 2009dc challenge the existing theory of type ia sn explosion of chandrasekhar mass wd ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "assuming the luminosity of sne ia is powered by radioactive decay of @xmath11ni synthesized in the explosion , the mass of @xmath11ni required to produce the observed luminosity of this class of objects exceeds 1 m@xmath10 . within the spherically symmetric explosion scenario , the existing models of sn ia explosion of chandrasekhar mass wd can not produce the required @xmath11ni .",
    "the inferred mass of @xmath11ni can be produced only with a progenitor more massive than a chandrasekhar mass wd .",
    "hence , these extremely luminous type ia sne have been termed as ` super - chandrasekhar - mass ' , or ` super - chandra ' type ia .",
    "they have very bright peak at maximum @xmath17 @xmath020 mag and the early post - maximum decline is very slow .",
    "apart from moderately low ejecta velocity and presence of unburned carbon , the near - maximum spectra of these objects are similar to those of normal sne ia . at nebular phase these sne exhibit a photometric and spectroscopic behaviour diverse from normal sne ia .",
    "they show enhanced fading in the light - curve with a possible break at @xmath16 150200 d , and very weak / absence of [ feiii ] emission in their nebular spectra @xcite .",
    "the luminous and broad light curves of the super - chandra sne do not follow the phillips luminosity - decline relation @xcite and may lead to wrong conclusions if included in cosmological studies @xcite .    to explain the observed properties of different classes of sne ia , a variety of theoretical models , incorporating both single - degenerate ( sd ) , and double - degenerate ( dd ) progenitors , with their masses ranging from sub - chandrasekhar to super - chandrasekhar , and propagation of the thermonuclear burning front via deflagration ( subsonic ) to detonation ( supersonic ) have been proposed ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "detonation models produce mostly iron group elements ( iges ) , while deflagration models produce both intermediate mass elements ( imes ) and iges , consistent with the observed spectra of sne ia .",
    "deflagration models leave most of the materials unburned , and are unable to produce high velocity features .",
    "the delayed detonation model @xcite , in which a deflagration to detonation transition occurs at some stage of the thermonuclear explosion , is however , successful in reproducing the observed characteristics of sne ia .",
    "models incorporating broken symmetries @xcite and asymmetric explosion @xcite have also been proposed to account for the observed diversity among sne ia .    in a sample of 29 objects",
    ", @xcite found that most of the luminous sne ia were found in galaxies with young stellar environments . with a larger sample of sne ia ,",
    "@xcite have shown that their light curve width closely tracks the specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) and stellar mass of the host galaxies  massive and/or low ssfr galaxies host sne with lower stretches ( narrow light curves or higher @xmath18 ) . super - chandra sne ia are also suggested to occur preferentially in young stellar and low metallicity environments @xcite .",
    "differential rotation and merging mechanisms may play key roles in increasing the progenitor mass suitable for these objects .",
    "a rotating wd can support more mass than the classical chandrasekhar mass limit of non rotating wd , with differentially rotating wds being more massive than the rigidly rotating wds @xcite .    in this paper , we present optical and uv data of the luminous type ia supernova sn 2012dn observed with 2-m himalayan chandra telescope ( hct ) , hanle and _ swift _ uvot .",

    "positrons are produced in the ejecta of sne ia by @xmath11co@xmath64@xmath11fe decay . around 50 d after explosion",
    ", the energy deposition is dominated by the interaction involving decay products of the @xmath11co@xmath64@xmath11fe chain , namely , gamma - ray photons and positrons . because of the significantly high energy available with photons per decay than positrons , during the early phase , energy deposition is dominated by photons . at later phase ( @xmath16 100 d after explosion ) , the energy deposition is dominated by positrons . at low ejecta density , positron may escape depending on the nature of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the escape of positron causes reduction in the energy deposition rates to the ejecta , which in turn leads to fainter light curves .",
    "this effect is found to be very low even at very late phase ; at @xmath16 400 d , it can account for at the most @xmath16 0.5 mag drop in the light curve @xcite .",
    "hence , the observed early steepening ( @xmath16 60 d after @xmath1 band maximum ) in the light curve of sn 2012dn can not be a consequence of escape of positrons .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the observed luminosity drop is probably the outcome of the flux distribution into infra - red , which could be accomplished by an early infra - red catastrophe ( irc ) or by dust formation .",
    "the irc causes shift of bulk emission from optical to infra - red wavelengths at late phases @xcite , resulting in significant drop in the late time optical light curves .",

    "the pre - maximum spectra of sn 2012dn show signature of cii @xmath716580 feature ( refer section [ sec : premax_spec ] ) , indicating the presence of unburned c. @xcite have shown that the c present in the ejecta can lead to formation of graphite dust in the supernova ejecta .",
    "the unburned c in the ejecta may also combine with o to form co molecules affecting the composition , size and mass of dust grain .",
    "further , radioactivity due to @xmath11ni produced in the explosion , destroys the molecules making c free for dust formation .",
    "the slow expansion velocity of the ejecta results in comparatively high densities at late phases , which may also promote formation of dust in the supernova ejecta .",
    "it thus appears that the observed fast decline in sn 2012dn might be due to dust formation .",
    "the onset of dust formation in the ejecta should also increase the luminosity in the near - infrared ( nir ) bands .",
    "however , due to non - availability of the nir data we are unable to confirm . for super - chandra objects , the observed differences in the onset of steepening in the light curve and magnitude drop can be understood in terms of different time - scales and intensities of dust formation @xcite .",

    "it is possible that the observed discrepancy in the siii and cii @xmath716580 velocity in sn 2012dn may be due to clumping and projection effect of carbon rich material , however , detailed modelling is required to confirm it .",

    "though , it is marginally luminous in the optical bands , it is @xmath16 one magnitude and two magnitudes brighter than normal sne ia in uvot @xmath43 and @xmath42 bands , respectively .",

    "is emitted in uv bands , similar to sn 2009dc @xcite .",
    "the peak bolometric luminosity of @xmath76 = 43.27 erg s@xmath8 indicates that @xmath16 0.82 m@xmath10 of @xmath11ni was synthesized in the explosion .",
    "the mass of @xmath11ni for sn 2012dn is on the higher side of @xmath11ni mass distribution for normal type ia events .",
    "sn 2012dn shows spectral features characteristic of normal sne ia , but with relatively narrow absorption lines .",
    "presence of unburned materials in the ejecta is evident from the cii 6580  absorption feature seen in the pre - maximum spectra . during the pre - maximum and close to maximum phase ,",
    "to reproduce observed shape of the spectra , the synthetic spectrum code syn++ needs significantly higher blackbody temperature , than those required for normal type ia events .",
    "however , during the post - maximum phase , synthetic spectrum with blackbody temperature similar to normal type ia fits the observed spectrum well .",
    "photospheric velocity of sn 2012dn , inferred from siii 6355  absorption line , is marginally greater than those of the super - chandra sne : sn 2003fg , sn 2007if , sn 2009dc and lower than sn 2006gz and normal type ia events .",
    "similar to super - chandra events , sn 2012dn has slow velocity evolution which is almost parallel to that of sn 2006gz .",
    "normal sne ia are expected to produce only weak emission in the far - uv , but interaction of the supernova ejecta with an extended progenitor such as red - giant star can produce excess of uv photons @xcite . based on the smoothness of the uv light curves and their qualitative similarity to the optical light curves ,",
    "the higher luminosity of sn 2012dn is associated with photospheric origin @xcite .",
    "further , the presence of stronger features in muv ( below 2700  ) and optical spectra also supports the photospheric origin for the excess emission , as flux from a hot shock would be relatively smooth and would dilute the photospheric features @xcite .",
    "hence , it is suggested that a higher temperature and lower opacity may contribute to the uv excess rather than a hot , smooth blackbody from shock interaction @xcite .",
    "however , the possibility of a structured spectrum with emission and absorption arising due to reprocessing of shock emission or originating from a different composition , is not ruled out . they have emphasized the need for higher quality uv spectra at the earliest possible epochs to probe the mechanism responsible for the excess uv emission .",
    "the syn++ fit of the pre - maximum spectra with very high blackbody temperature also supports the photospheric origin for excess luminosity in the early phase .",
    "the light generation by significant interaction of the ejecta with a csm can also result in increased luminosity of super - chandra sne @xcite .",
    "usually presence of csm around sne ia is inferred through either temporal variability @xcite or statistical analysis of the velocity of narrow absorption features @xcite .",
    "supernovae with relatively narrow hydrogen emission lines that are linked to sne ia are labelled as `` ia - csm '' objects . @xcite",
    "have investigated the observable signatures of sne ia - csm and argued that at least some sne ia arise from the sd channel , since a hydrogen rich csm is most likely the result of sd scenario .",
    "these are the extreme cases of interaction of supernova ejecta with the csm .",
    "the absence of any variable narrow absorption lines and narrow hydrogen emission lines in our medium resolution spectra indicates that appreciable amount of csm may not be present around sn 2012dn to give rise to higher luminosity .",
    "the decline in the magnitude in 50 days after @xmath1 maximum listed in the table [ tab_decline ] shows that sn 2012dn has slower decline than normal sne ia and sn 1991 t and faster than sn 2009dc in all the bands ( in @xmath1 band sn 1991 t and sn 2012dn have comparable decline rates ) . @xcite",
    "have demonstrated that despite having significantly different peak magnitudes , shape of the post - maximum light curve in @xmath89 band of supernova lsq12gdj , sn 2007if and sn 1991t - like sn 2005",
    "m are similar and different from the ia - csm objects ( refer fig",
    ". 10 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , presence of blueshifted naid and caii h&k absorption in the high resolution spectrum of supernova lsq12gdj led @xcite to postulate that some csm may be present around lsq12gdj while its contribution to the luminosity is negligible .",
    "@xcite have discussed the possibility of the csm consists of c , o or heavier elements , sufficiently close to the progenitor . the tamped detonation , in which a white dwarf surrounded by an extended envelope explodes ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , presents a possible progenitor system with csm .",
    "it produces luminous events with longer rise time , which appear much like normal type ia supernova after maximum .",
    "the extended envelope may come from an accreted binary companion .",
    "the presence of c feature in the spectra of sn 2012dn till @xmath16 10 days after maximum indicates possibility of explosion in a c rich environment .",
    "the presence of c in the csm would also provide conducive environment for dust formation , which may explain the observed steepening in the light curve @xmath16 50 days after maximum .",

    "<S> we present optical and uv analysis of the luminous type ia supernova sn 2012dn covering the period @xmath011 to + 109 days with respect to the @xmath1 band maximum , that occurred on jd 2456132.89 @xmath2 0.19 , with an apparent magnitude of @xmath3 = 14.38 @xmath2 0.02 . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute magnitudes at maximum in @xmath1 and @xmath4 bands are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> sn 2012dn is marginally luminous compared to normal type ia supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> the peak bolometric luminosity of @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 suggests that @xmath9 m@xmath10 of @xmath11ni was synthesized in the explosion . </S>",
    "<S> the decline rate @xmath12 mag is lower than that of normal type ia supernovae , and similar to the luminous sn 1991 t . </S>",
    "<S> however , the photometric and spectroscopic behaviour of sn 2012dn is different from that of sn 1991 t . </S>",
    "<S> early phase light curves in @xmath13 and @xmath14 bands are very broad . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath14 band peak has a plateau - like appearance similar to the super - chandra sn 2009dc . </S>",
    "<S> pre - maximum spectra show clear evidence of cii 6580  line , indicating the presence of unburned materials . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity evolution of cii line is peculiar . except for the very early phase ( @xmath1513 d ) , </S>",
    "<S> the cii line velocity is lower than the velocity estimated using the siii line . during the pre - maximum and close to maximum phase , </S>",
    "<S> to reproduce observed shape of the spectra , the synthetic spectrum code syn++ needs significantly higher blackbody temperature than those required for normal type ia events . </S>",
    "<S> the photospheric velocity evolution and other spectral properties are similar to those of the carbon - rich sn 2006gz .    </S>",
