    "this has been a very exciting year for particle physics .",
    "the lhc has been performing beyond expectations . at the time of this writing ,",
    "each experiment has recorded approximately 5/fb of data at 7 tev center of mass energy .",
    "dozens of searches for new physics have been published by cms and atlas analyzing @xmath5/fb of data .",
    "unfortunately , all have yielded null results so far . as we enter the second full year of 7 tev running , it is a good time to pause and survey the current status of lhc searches for new physics",
    ". the purpose of this paper will be to carry out this survey for a particularly well - motivated theoretical scenario : gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ; for a review and original references , see  @xcite ) .",
    "the searches we will survey are listed in table  [ tab : searches ] .",
    "these searches have typically expressed their results as constraints on the cmssm and various  simplified models \" with neutralino lsp ( though notable exceptions like  @xcite set limits on simplified parameter spaces in gmsb ) . in this paper",
    ", we will carefully reinterpret these results in terms of gmsb .",
    ".a summary of the most recent lhc searches with @xmath6/fb relevant to gmsb . included in this table is also the cms @xmath7+@xmath8+met search with 35/pb , since this is so far the only search in this final state .",
    "not included here are : cms all - hadronic searches with @xmath0  @xcite and razor  @xcite ( overlapping with standard jets+met ) ; atlas search for multileptons+met  @xcite ( not updated to 1/fb yet ) ; 2/fb cms searches for multileptons  @xcite , which were released as this paper was nearing completion ; and 1/fb atlas searches for os dileptons and ss dileptons @xcite , described in a talk while this paper was in preparation . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab - gmsb - analyses - long ]      a number of atlas and cms searches look for signatures of heavy stable charged particles ( hscps ) that propagate through the tracker without decaying , or stop in the detector and decay later . here",
    "we will review the most recent analyses ( both cms ) with @xmath9 1/fb .",
    "the 1.1/fb cms search  @xcite looks for high-@xmath10 isolated tracks with large ionization energy loss @xmath11 .",
    "another analysis presented in the same study requires also the presence of a slow muon candidate which allows loosening of some of the other cuts . for colored nlsps",
    "the slow muon signature is only relevant if their @xmath12-hadrons do not all neutralize before reaching the muon detectors .",
    "the limits resulting from the two approaches are similar .",
    "cms excludes direct pair production of stable gluinos up to 800900  gev , and of stops up to 500600  gev ( uncertainties are from unknown @xmath12-hadron physics ) .",
    "they also obtained a limit in a minimal gauge mediation ( mgm ) scenario with stau nlsp , with production primarily through heavier squarks , gluinos , and winos .",
    "this was expressed as a limit on the mass of the stau , but this is only meaningful in the context of mgm where the stau mass is related to the masses of all the other sparticles .",
    "clearly , it would be interesting to understand the limits on staus more model - independently , e.g.  as a limit on the direct stau production cross section .",
    "it would also be useful to know how the limits from this search apply to other scenarios , such as long - lived sbottoms ( constrained by a smaller - statistics atlas study of @xmath12-hadrons  @xcite using 34/pb that obtained a slightly weaker limit on sbottoms than stops ) , or chargino nlsps  @xcite ( on which a recent d@xmath13 search  @xcite with 5.2/fb set a limit of 217  gev on a higgsino - like chargino and 267 gev on a gaugino - like chargino ) .",
    "cms has also searched  @xcite for long - lived colored particles that form charged @xmath12-hadrons which ( @xmath14% or more of the time ) come to rest due to interactions with the detector material and decay much later , often out - of - time with respect to the collisions .",
    "the study set limits on pair - produced gluinos and stops with lifetimes between @xmath15  ns and @xmath16  s. however , the strongest limits from these searches are weaker than the direct search  @xcite .",
    "overall , searches for heavy stable charged particles are a relatively mature science , and our main suggestion here is , wherever possible , to present the limits on several reasonable scenarios ( stops , sbottoms , gluinos , staus , charginos ) rather than a single one .",
    "also , we believe these limits are more meaningful when phrased in terms of physical masses and cross sections rather than in terms of artificial model parameters such as those of mgm .",
    "gmsb is a rich source of well - motivated simplified models that can be used to guide experimental searches for displaced decays .",
    "these decays fall into two types : decays of neutral particles ( with displaced vertex , timing , or pointing signatures ) and decays of charged particles ( with additional kinked track signatures ) . in either case ,",
    "reconstructing the displaced decay can be a powerful tool for precise measurements of new physics  @xcite .",
    "kinks and other odd features in tracks are currently under - studied and new physics with large cross sections could be hiding there  @xcite .",
    "thus , a more comprehensive approach to studying such displaced decays is very well - motivated .",
    "so far both atlas and cms have released one study of displaced vertices that could be relevant for ggm . the atlas search  @xcite looks for vertices that are displaced significantly from the primary vertex , in events containing a high-@xmath10 muon ( from any vertex ) .",
    "they set limits on an rpv scenario in which squarks decay to neutralinos decaying as @xmath17 .",
    "limits are set on particles with lifetimes @xmath18 .",
    "typical excluded cross sections are @xmath19  pb , with some mass dependence . these limits ( based on only 33/pb of data ) will improve with more statistics since the search is background - free .",
    "this kind of search can be useful for ggm scenarios in which a long - lived nlsp can decay into jets ( to create the @xmath20 tracks needed for identifying the displaced vertex ) as long as there is also a high-@xmath10 muon in the event .",
    "one example is when two neutralino nlsps are produced from the decays of heavier particles , and at least one of the neutralinos decays into a hadronically decaying @xmath21 or @xmath22 , with the muon either produced from the cascade decay at the primary vertex or in the decay of the second neutralino into a @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "another example could be pair production of stop nlsps , although a stop nlsp would travel inside an @xmath12-hadron , and it is unclear to us whether the search will still work as - is in cases where the @xmath12-hadron is charged and thus has a track going from the primary to the secondary vertex .",
    "the cms search  @xcite looks for displaced vertices formed by @xmath24 or @xmath25 pairs .",
    "a search of this kind can be relevant for long - lived neutralino nlsps that can decay into a @xmath21 ( the branching ratio can be close to @xmath26 for a higgsino ) , as studied in detail in  @xcite .",
    "the cms search sets limits of 10 to 100 fb on @xmath27 for lifetimes from 0.1 cm to 100 cm , with mild dependence on choices of masses .",
    "however , since the benchmark model used in  @xcite does not include met , the search includes the requirement that , in the transverse plane , the total momentum of the leptons must point along the line connecting the primary and secondary vertex .",
    "this will not be the case in the gmsb scenarios because some of the momentum is carried by the gravitino .",
    "we estimate that the efficiency of this requirement for 250 gev higgsinos is 50% in the electron channel ( where the cut is @xmath28 ) and 16% in the muon channel ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "overall , we expect that interesting limits can be placed on long - lived neutralinos with this search , especially if the cut on @xmath30 can be relaxed .    in recent talks",
    "two more results have been presented .",
    "cms has analyzed displaced decays to photons , in events with one well - identified photon and another that converts in the tracker  @xcite .",
    "this applies directly to neutralino nlsps with @xmath31 final states .",
    "it would be interesting to relax some of the requirements , e.g. to allow an electron instead of a photon , to attempt to include cases where one decay might go to @xmath32 .",
    "the other new result is an atlas search for disappearing tracks  @xcite , motivated by degenerate wino lsps . from the available information it is unclear to us whether this would constrain signals like a stau decaying in flight , but it would be interesting to see the result interpreted in such gmsb contexts .",
    "these searches are interesting , but much more territory remains to be explored .",
    "at the most trivial level , any of our simplified models could be supplemented with an additional parameter @xmath33 for the nlsp decay , which can range from less than a millimeter to much larger than the detector size .",
    "more generally , it is important to keep in mind the important physical parameters that go into determining the sensitivity of a given analysis .",
    "these include :    * _ production cross section : _ searches should make sure to specify the production mode precisely .",
    "this could be controlled by the nlsp mass itself , in the case of direct production , or by the mass of heavier states ( e.g.  gluinos ) which are produced more copiously . *",
    "_ nlsp lifetime : _ this parameter is obviously is crucial for any search that looks for displaced objects .",
    "it is of paramount importance in any such search to show the limit or acceptance as a function of the lifetime . *",
    "_ nlsp mass : _ this will control the kinematics of the displaced decay products of the nlsp , which can in turn affect greatly the sensitivity of a given search . * _ nlsp boost : _ if the nlsp is boosted , e.g.  due to the decay of a heavier state , then this could also affect the kinematics of the displaced objects .",
    "it would be very interesting to see the dependence of the sensitivity on the nlsp boost .",
    "finally , a comment about triggering .",
    "this is a major challenge for any inclusive displaced object search .",
    "we would just like to point out that in gmsb , displaced objects are always accompanied with _ significant missing energy _ , since the long - lived nlsp is always decaying to the gravitino in addition to a visible object .",
    "so met triggers could prove to be a key ingredient for gmsb - motivated displaced - object searches .",
    "in this paper we have surveyed the space of all possible nlsp types in gauge mediation . for each case",
    ", we have analyzed a variety of production mechanisms , including cascade decays from strongly and electroweakly produced particles and direct production . in some of the cases we varied additional parameters in order to cover the largest possible part of the signature space .",
    "even though our results are cast in the framework of ggm , their description in terms of simplified models provides information about many spectra that appear in other susy breaking schemes as well .",
    "thus our work gives a broad general picture about the status of susy in light of the 1/fb of data from the lhc .",
    "we have found that in some cases the colored superpartners can still be very light , even without any special fine - tuning of the spectrum .",
    "for example , the gluino can be as light as @xmath34  gev in the sneutrino co - nlsps scenario . in some other scenarios",
    "the colored particles are much more constrained .",
    "the limits on gluinos for all nlsp types are summarized in figure  [ fig - limits - summary ] .",
    "some of the limits are strong and are already close to the kinematic limit of the 7  tev lhc ( depicted by the dashed vertical line in figure  [ fig - limits - summary ] ) .",
    "still , a large amount of parameter space remains viable at 7 tev .",
    "[ fig - limits - summary ]    scenarios in which just a single third - generation squark is light have much weaker limits .",
    "we have found a limit of @xmath35  gev on the direct pair production of sbottom nlsps .",
    "we have also found that multiple susy searches are interesting for light stop nlsps , becoming competitive with the current estimated tevatron limit of @xmath36  gev .",
    "it should be noted though that the cuts used in these searches are rather hard relative to the stop mass , and the light stop events make it into the sample only due to their large cross sections .",
    "because of these tiny efficiencies , the results strongly depend on the tails of distributions which we can not claim to have simulated reliably . therefore , we prefer not to quote a limit on the stop nlsp mass , which might be somewhere around @xmath37  gev .",
    "more dedicated experimental searches for stop nlsps , or more careful simulations of the existing ones , are sorely needed .",
    "we have pointed out that small optimizations of some of the existing analyses , or certain other types of searches , can probe the light stop regime more thoroughly .",
    "clearly , stop nlsps can still be as light as @xmath38  gev , and we have also seen that in such a scenario all the other squarks can be relatively light as well , near just 600  gev .",
    "constraining electroweak production is harder , and overall the lhc is far from reaching its 7 tev kinematic limit ( @xmath39 gev for wino production , as discussed in the introduction ) .",
    "still , we found that the @xmath40+met searches set a limit of @xmath41  gev on the production of winos decaying to bino nlsps .",
    "we have also estimated that directly produced wino co - nlsps can be constrained to @xmath42  gev with the data available today .",
    "another potentially clean scenario of electroweak production is winos decaying to slepton co - nlsps , which may have good sensitivity in a ss dilepton search without jet requirements , or a multi - lepton search .",
    "overall , in most cases , we have found that the strongest limits are set by very general searches for jets and missing @xmath43 .",
    "the exceptions are searches with extremely low backgrounds : @xmath40+met , which is by far the strongest limit on bino nlsps , and same - sign dileptons , which sets powerful limits on slepton nlsps and scenarios with multiple top quarks , e.g.  squarks or gluinos decaying to stop nlsps .",
    "clearly , such searches are very powerful and play to the lhc s strengths .",
    "we have seen though that other specialized searches such as @xmath21+jets+met and @xmath44-jets+met could do better if they included harder cuts on hadronic activity similarly to some of the jets+met search regions .    as the lhc moves from 1/fb studies to 5/fb or more , channels which are clean but",
    "have low branching fractions will become increasingly powerful .",
    "for instance , currently the best limits on @xmath21-rich higgsino nlsps come from jets + met and @xmath45+jets+met searches , but with more data , @xmath46+met becomes a promising channel as well .",
    "another example , relevant to @xmath44-rich scenarios , is requiring three or more @xmath44-tags in an event , which should greatly reduce background at the cost of lowered signal efficiency .    with greater integrated luminosity , more sophisticated search strategies will also become viable .",
    "we have argued that a cut on leptonic @xmath0 can enhance the power of searches involving dileptons by removing the largest backgrounds in a more targeted way .",
    "brute force is enough for the lhc to trounce tevatron limits , but there is still a need for more refined techniques to significantly extend what energy alone has accomplished so far .    for the next round of lhc searches",
    ", it may be useful to keep in mind some theoretical expectations .",
    "many models in which the known forces are unified predict that colored superpartners are significantly heavier than uncolored superpartners , which provides motivation for directly aiming searches at electroweak production of gauginos , higgsinos , or sleptons . as we have seen ,",
    "so far such processes are almost unconstrained .",
    "furthermore , naturalness motivates light stops to cancel divergences in the higgs mass . by 5/fb the lhc , with the combination of additional statistics and potentially refined search strategies , should be a sensitive probe of light stops .",
    "thus , two of the most well - justified signals from a theoretical point of view ",
    "light electroweak superpartners and light stops  will be among the highly relevant new pieces of information that potentially will arrive with 5/fb searches . finally , we hope that long lifetimes will be explored more systematically in upcoming analyses .",
    "while susy was not right around the corner , our results have identified a large region that still has room for interesting discoveries .",

    "we base the simulation on pythia  8.150  @xcite interfaced with fastjet  @xcite .",
    "since the implementation of some of the susy processes in pythia  8 is not yet complete we use the pythia  6pythia  8 interface to import all the susy processes from pythia  6.4.22  @xcite . for parton distributions",
    "we use cteq6l1  @xcite ( obtained via lhapdf  @xcite ) .",
    "pythia output is processed with a crude detector simulation code that mimics the object identification procedures of a generic lhc detector . in particular , we take the effective calorimeter coverage to be @xmath47 . for charged particles , we only accept @xmath48  gev . we allow the identification of tracks , photons , electrons , muons , hadronic taus and @xmath44 jets within @xmath49 ( further cuts are applied at the analysis level ) .",
    "we compute the missing energy vector @xmath50 based on the energy deposits in the calorimeters , as well as the full energies of muons . for a lepton ( @xmath51 or @xmath52 )",
    "to be isolated , the sum , within @xmath53 , of the @xmath10 of all other tracks , plus the transverse energy deposited in the calorimeter , except the contribution of the lepton itself , must be smaller than @xmath54 of the lepton @xmath10 . for",
    "a photon to be isolated , the summed @xmath10 of tracks , the transverse electromagnetic energy and the transverse hadronic energy within @xmath55 ( excluding the photon contribution ) should satisfy @xmath56  gev , @xmath57  gev , and @xmath58  gev .",
    "jets are formed from the calorimeter deposits ( except those of the isolated leptons and photons ) using the anti-@xmath59 jet algorithm  @xcite with cone size @xmath60 .",
    "hadronically decaying taus that originate from the hard process ( but not from jet fragmentation ) are `` reconstructed '' by taking their momentum before the decay and subtracting the momentum of the neutrino .",
    "hadronic tau jets ( usually a single jet ) are identified as those jets that are within @xmath61 around the reconstructed tau . for @xmath44 tagging , for each @xmath62 meson , we find the jet closest in @xmath12 , with @xmath55 and @xmath10 within @xmath63 of @xmath10 of the @xmath62 meson . if such a jet exists , we indicate it as a @xmath44 candidate . later , in the analysis stage , we apply approximate trigger , object identification and @xmath44 tagging efficiencies , to the extent that such information is available in the description of the relevant atlas or cms analysis .",
    "our simulation is significantly faster than pgs  @xcite because it does not discretize the calorimeters .",
    "we also do not simulate the energy resolutions of the various objects .",
    "neither detail is essential for our purposes .    in the calculation of efficiency , each event that starts with two colored superpartners is weighted by a corresponding nlo @xmath64 factor from prospino  2.1  @xcite .",
    "these are also used in combination with the lo cross sections from pythia for determining the cross section .    to compute limits on our simplified parameter spaces",
    ", we have used the  model - independent upper limits \" quoted in the experimental publications , wherever available . when these numbers were not available , we have used the standard @xmath65 statistic  @xcite . for searches with multiple subanalyses ,",
    "we have used the subanalysis which gave the best limit .",
    "an essential condition for the validity of a work like ours is the ability to reliably simulate the experimental searches using only publicly available information from the experiments . luckily , many of the recent lhc searches put a special effort into making their results suitable for re - analysis by theorists who want to apply them to different new physics scenarios .",
    "but in some cases certain important pieces of information were missing .",
    "we would like to list several items that in our opinion are important to be included in papers presenting experimental results :    * typical identification efficiencies of the various objects ( leptons , photons , @xmath44-jets ) , with a rough parameterization of the @xmath10 or @xmath66 dependence where relevant . * the likely treatment of other types of objects in the event besides those relevant to the particular search .",
    "suppose , for example , that a hard photon is present in an analysis that does not explicitly identify photons .",
    "will it simply be counted as a jet , or fail certain jet quality requirements ? if it fails to be a jet , will it consequently be ignored , or will it disqualify the entire event from being included in the sample ? * the description of other experimental effects whose precise simulation happens to be crucial for the particular analysis ( e.g. , resolutions of certain quantities ) .",
    "* simulated event yields for several signal points .",
    "these are important for validating the theorists simulation of the analysis .",
    "* whenever possible , a model - independent @xmath65 bound on the rate of signal events passing the cuts .",
    "details of the treatment of systematic errors would be helpful .",
    "even more helpful would be public release of @xmath65-calculating codes or likelihoods .",
    "* precise definitions of variables such as @xmath67 and @xmath68 , with all conditions on the number of jets to be summed over , their @xmath10 cuts , and so on .",
    "much of the work in this paper has been in reinterpreting existing lhc searches in terms of ggm parameter spaces for which they were not originally intended .",
    "clearly , it would be very useful to have an official framework like the proposed recast  @xcite which could automate and standardize this process .",
