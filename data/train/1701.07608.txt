    "in the present paper , we have two principal goals .",
    "first , we present data which have a bearing on the existence of correlations between rotation and activity (  racs \" ) in our sample of stars .",
    "second , we ask if the empirical correlations can be interpreted in the context of stellar dynamo theories ( which attempt to predict the properties of the magnetic fields which are generated in a star with a prescribed structure and rotation ) . the second goal is admittedly a challenging one : the basic mechanisms underlying stellar dynamo theory are being continuously improved as computer resources permit inclusion of more realistic physical effects . rather than attempting to provide a comprehensive discussion of these complexities , we simplify our discussion by restricting attention to certain broad classes of dynamos .",
    "we briefly outline the distinction between these classes in what follows .",
    "whatever the source of the magnetic field , the observational consequences of such a field in a star is expected to be the same : dissipation of mechanical energy associated with magnetic processes leads to enhanced emission ( relative to what is generated by the photosphere ) from the chromosphere ( in spectral lines such as caii h and k or @xmath4 ) and from the corona ( in x - ray continuum ) .",
    "these enhanced emissions arising from magnetic effects in the stellar atmosphere on the are considered in this paper to be generic indicators of what we refer to as  magnetic activity \" , or more briefly ,  activity \" . in this paper",
    ", we seek to quantify how ( an observational quantity that is associated with )",
    " activity \" in low - mass dwarfs is correlated with ( an observational quantity that is associated with )  rotation \" . in order to set the stage for interpreting our result",
    ", we first need to define certain terms which are related to dynamo models .",
    "models of dynamos in the sun and stars are typically based on ",
    "mean - field electrodynamics `` ( mfe ) : the fluid flow and the magnetic field are separated into mean ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) and turbulent ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) components ( e.g. racine et al . 2011 ) .",
    "although the mean values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are by definition zero , the mean value of their cross - product does _ not _ reduce to zero , but instead produces a non - zero turbulent mfe , @xmath9 .",
    "the essence of mfe is to express the ( vector ) @xmath9 in terms of the large - scale ( vector ) magnetic field @xmath6 by means of a tensor expansion in the mean field plus its gradients . the leading order term in this expansion @xmath10 = @xmath11 @xmath12",
    "is called the ' ' @xmath13-effect \" .",
    "parker ( 1955 ) first suggested that the @xmath13-effect might arise because cyclonic convective turbulence can systematically twist a large - scale magnetic field , and in the process , regenerate a large - scale poloidal field .",
    "all of the dynamos we consider here rely on the @xmath13-effect , as well as on ( at least ) one more factor .    in order to construct a mean - field dynamo model ,",
    "< b > is written as the sum of poloidal and toroidal components , and < u > is assumed to be directed purely in the azimuthal direction @xmath14 , and to be axisymmetric , i.e. the angular velocity @xmath15 can be a function of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , but not of @xmath14 . with these assumptions ,",
    "the induction equation for the time - varying magnetic field can be separated into two equations , one for the poloidal field , the other for the toroidal field .",
    "source terms ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) appear in both equations , and the dominant source terms determine the dynamo class . for the poloidal equation",
    ", @xmath18 is a single term , namely , the @xmath14 component of _ e _ , i.e. the @xmath13-effect . for the toroidal equation , @xmath19 contains two terms : ( i ) includes a spatial gradient of @xmath15 ; ( ii ) includes a spatial gradient of @xmath20 .",
    "three classes of mean - field dynamos are defined as follows : ( a ) @xmath13-@xmath15 dynamo , in which only term ( i ) is retained in the toroidal equation ; ( b ) @xmath21 dynamo , in which only term ( ii ) is retained in the toroidal equation ; ( c ) @xmath21-@xmath15 dynamo , in which terms ( i ) and ( ii ) are both retained in the toroidal equation .",
    "models of dwarf stars of spectral type f , g , k , and early m possess a radiative core and a convective envelope . in such stars , magnetic fields can be generated by an @xmath13-@xmath15 dynamo ( also referred to as an interface dynamo , or shell dynamo , parker 1975 ) .",
    "the strongest toroidal magnetic fields in these stars expected to be produced in the vicinity of the interface (  tachocline \" ) between the radiative core and the convective envelope where the differential rotation is the strongest . in stars which are massive enough to contain such an interface , and where therefore the possibility of an  interface dynamo \" ( i d ) exists , data pertaining to enhanced emission from such stars in chromospheric spectral lines and/or in coronal x - rays reveal clearly that there is a strong correlation between rotation and activity indicators ( e.g. pallavicini et al .",
    "1981 ; wright et al .",
    "2011 ) , i.e. the rac has a slope with a numerical value that is definitely non - zero .",
    "however , since limber ( 1958 ) derived models of cool main sequence stars with lower and lower masses , it has been widely believed by stellar evolution modelers that interfaces do not exist in all low - mass stars .",
    "an anonymous referee has pointed out that  there has been no definitive evidence validating this theoretical prediction \" . in principle , asteroseismology of m dwarfs might eventually provide p - mode frequencies with enough precision that ( by analogy with helioseismological data ) signatures of the interface could be identified .",
    "but although theoretical models have been calculated for such stars ( see rodriguez - lopez et al .",
    "2014 ) , no empirical data on reliable p - mode periods in m dwarfs are yet available . despite the lack of definitive evidence at the present time , we shall adopt the widely held belief that stars on the main sequence undergo a transition to complete convection ( ttcc ) at a certain spectral type . according to models , main sequence stars with masses that are less than a critical value of about 0.30 - 0.35  @xmath22 are completely convective .",
    "such stars should have no tachocline whatsoever on the main sequence . and",
    "yet the empirical evidence shows that stars with masses less than 0.30 - 0.35  @xmath22 also show enhanced emission in chromospheric lines and in x - ray continuum .",
    "since we have attributed such enhanced emission in warmer stars to magnetic activity , then it seems natural also to ascribe the enhanced emissions in completely convective stars to magnetic activity .",
    "such activity must rely on a non - interface type of dynamo , possibly an @xmath23 dynamo ( distributive dynamo : dd ) , maintained by convective turbulence alone ( e.g. roberts & stix 1972 , rosner 1980 , dobler et al .",
    "2006 , chabrier & kuker 2006 ) .",
    "it is important to note that the existence of complete convection in a star does not mean that the star is necessarily completely convective at all stages of its main sequence phase of evolution .",
    "feiden and dotter ( 2013 ) report that a 0.3  @xmath22 model arrives on the main sequence with a radiative zone sandwiched between two convective zones : the models suggest that such a  sandwich \" structure exists for several gigayears before the model becomes completely convective ( see also rodriguez - lopez et al .",
    "2014 ) . however , at lower masses , 0.25  @xmath22 , stellar models _ are _ completely convective at all ages ( see rodriguez - lopez et al .",
    "thus , when we use the label  completely convective \" for stars of masses in the intermediate range ( 0.25 - 0.3 )  @xmath22 , the label involves not merely a question of the _ mass _ of the model , but also of the _ age _ of the model .",
    "this complication may cause some ambiguity when we attempt to interpret racs in the vicinity of the ttcc .",
    "for simplicity , it would be convenient if a given star could be assigned to having either an i d or a dd .",
    "but we recognize that such a simplified approach can not be the whole story : in cool stars where an interface exists , the inevitable presence of a deep convective envelope gives rise to the possibility that i d and dd may both be operating ( e.g. brandenburg & subramanian 2005 ; brown et al .",
    "2010 ) .    in order to distinguish between the observational properties of i d and dd , durney , de young & roxburgh ( 1993 ) pointed out some differences between i d and dd .",
    "first , the magnetic field created by an i d should depend strongly on rotation whereas the magnetic field created by a dd should not . in terms of the notation to be used in the present paper , this would lead one to expect that in an i d star , the rac should have a slope which is definitely non - zero , whereas in a dd star , the rac slope should be essentially zero .",
    "second , although ids can produce activity cycles in the large - scale field it was not clear ( in 1993 ) how dd could ever give rise to a cycle .",
    "since 1993 , the second feature has been called into question .",
    "e.g. stefani & gerberth ( 2003 ) have demonstrated that cyclic behavior _ is _ possible in @xmath21 dynamo models provided that the following condition is satisfied : the @xmath13-effect needs to have radial gradients which are sufficiently steep , including changes in the algebraic sign .",
    "moreover , recent modeling suggests that the third class of dynamo models ( @xmath21-@xmath15 ) might be a better description to the solar dynamo ( where there is certainly an interface ) than an @xmath13-@xmath15 dynamo ( e.g. lawson et al 2015 ) .",
    "from the perspective of a change from an @xmath13-@xmath15 dynamo to an @xmath21-@xmath15 dynamo , perhaps in completely convective stars , we might also encounter a change from an @xmath21 dynamo to an @xmath24-@xmath15 dynamo .",
    "if this happens , then we might find that rather than seeing a zero slope for the rac in a completely convective star , the inclusion of @xmath15 in the dynamo model could lead to a non - zero rac slope .",
    "a long standing problem has been the search for an observational signature of the putative transition between different types of dynamos at the ttcc",
    ". there has been several attempts to detect a change in magnetic activity diagnostics ( e.g. mullan & macdonald 2001 ) or magnetic field topologies ( e.g. donati et al .",
    "2008 , morin et al .",
    "2008 , 2010 , phan - bao et al .",
    "2009 , stassun et al .",
    "2011 ) in the vicinity of the ttcc .",
    "none of these studies have identified unambiguous and definitive signatures of significant changes in magnetic activity at the ttcc . however , in a recent paper , west et al .",
    "( 2015 ) have reported on a study of racs in two groups of dwarfs : m1-m4 , and m5-m8 .",
    "west et al . ( 2015 ) found that the rac in m1-m4 stars has a somewhat different slope than the rac in m5-m8 stars ( see sect .",
    "4 below for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "one interpretation of this behavior is that something changes as regards the dynamo between m4 and m5 .",
    "we will return to a discussion of this interpretation ( as well as an alternative interpretation ) in section 4 below .    in order to address the ttcc - dynamo - transition topic meaningfully ,",
    "we first need to identify at what spectral type the ttcc occurs . limber ( 1958 ) states that  in that part of the main sequence where the inner radiative region ... is becoming vanishingly small \" , the corresponding spectral type is m3v - m4v .",
    "subsequently , dorman et al .",
    "( 1989 ) placed the ttcc at @xmath25 , which corresponds to the spectral subtype dm4 .",
    "even more recently , chabrier & baraffe ( 1997 ) predict that the ttcc occurs at @xmath26 , which corresponds to the spectral subtype dm2 .",
    "therefore , it appears that the ttcc may lie somewhere in the range between subtypes dm2 and dm4 , corresponding to masses of 0.25 - 0.4  @xmath22 ( stassun et al .",
    "the theoretical mass limit at the ttcc has been found to shift towards slightly smaller masses if different boundary conditions are used for the stellar models ( mullan et al .",
    "( even larger shifts of the ttcc towards lower masses were at one time proposed by mullan and macdonald 2001 if interior magnetic fields were to be as large as @xmath27 g. if fields as large as that were to exist inside stars , the definition of a  fully convective star \" could become more ambiguous : the onset of complete convection would then depend not only on the mass and age of a star , but would also depend on how strong its magnetic field is .",
    "however , we may not in fact need to worry about this ambiguity : browning et al .",
    "( 2016 ) have recently argued that such strong fields would be unstable .",
    "in standard main - sequence models , the radius of a model scales almost linearly with mass : therefore , the ttcc is expected to lie in the radius range of roughly 0.25 - 0.4  @xmath28 . according to the radius-@xmath29 calibration of houdebine et al .",
    "( 2016b ) this radius range yields an effective temperature range of 3200 - 3500  k for the ttcc .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the topic of a possible dynamo transition at the ttcc using a more extensive and more fine - grained data set than has previously been available for study .",
    "empirically , evidence for rotationally driven dynamos in cool stars first emerged when researchers plotted the strength of chromospheric emission versus stellar rotation .",
    "e.g. see kraft ( 1967 ) , vaughan et al .",
    "( 1981 ) , soderblom ( 1982 ) , vogt et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , noyes et al . ( 1984 ) , marcy & chen ( 1992 ) , patten & simon ( 1996 ) , fekel ( 1997 ) , delfosse et al . ( 1998 ) , jeffries et al . ( 2000 ) , pizzolato et al . ( 2003 ) , mohanty & basri ( 2003 ) , browning et al . (",
    "2010 ) , wright et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , rebassa - mansergas et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , west et al .",
    "( 2015 ) .",
    "the key signature is the following : emission in chromospheric spectral lines is observed to be stronger in stars with faster rotation speed @xmath30 ( or shorter rotation period p ) ( e.g. vaughan et al 1981 ) .",
    "this is defined as a  rotation - activity correlation \" ( rac ) .",
    "the existence of an rac is consistent with the expectations that ( i ) the faster the rotation is , the stronger are the magnetic fields which can be generated ( e.g. mullan et al . 2015 ) , and ( ii ) stronger fields are associated with stronger chromospheric heating ( skumanich et al . 1975 ) and with stronger coronal heating ( e.g. mullan 2009 ) .",
    "thus , if chromospheric emission intensity is plotted as a function of @xmath31 , it is found that over a certain range of periods , the rac has a clearly _ negative _ slope .",
    "however , as more data are accumulated , it emerges that the negative slope of the rac does _ not _ extend indefinitely to shorter and shorter @xmath31 .",
    "instead , when @xmath31 becomes shorter than a certain value @xmath32 , no further increase in emission occurs : for @xmath33 , the rac becomes flat ( e.g. vilhu 1984 ) , with a slope of zero . by definition , in the flattened portion of the rac , increasing rotation does _ not _ result in increased chromospheric / coronal emission . for solar type stars",
    ", the transition to a flat curve occurs for @xmath343 days .",
    "vilhu suggested the term  saturated \" to refer to such conditions .",
    "similarly , wright et al .",
    "( 2011 ) found that the saturation regime occurs at about @xmath35 .",
    "reiners et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found that the sturation occurs at the critical rossby number @xmath36 .",
    "we shall compare these values to those we obtain for our stellar samples below .",
    "pizzolato et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found that saturation occurs from a period of about @xmath37 days in solar type stars to about @xmath38 days in m dwarfs .",
    "rebassa - mansergas et al .",
    "( 2013 ) found that stars with @xmath39 are all in the saturated regime .",
    "this yields a rotation period of @xmath40 days for stars at the spectral type dm3 ( see paper  i ) .",
    "therefore , we shall consider that saturation occurs for periods of about @xmath40 days or @xmath41 .",
    "since in our stellar samples we have stars with shorter rotation periods or @xmath42 , we shall consider below that these stars likely lie in the saturated regime .",
    "vilhu suggested that  saturation \" might be due to a complete coverage of the star s surface by magnetic fields .",
    "another explanation of  saturation \" was offered by mullan ( 1984 ) in terms of the maximum possible flux of mechanical energy that can be generated by convection . in the present paper",
    ", we shall not attempt to identify the physical process which leads to saturation . instead",
    ", we shall adopt a purely empirical approach , and we shall refer to the flat portion of an rac as  saturated \" . in the same vein , we shall refer to an rac with a statistically significant negative slope as  unsaturated \" . to the extent that an rac owes its existence to the operation of a dynamo of some kind , we can say that the dynamo reveals itself in two regimes : saturated and unsaturated .",
    "the properties of the two different dynamo regimes we find below ( see section 3.8.1 ) for the low and high activity sub - samples respectively can not be due to effects of the chromospheric response to non - thermal heating mechanisms .",
    "in fact , there does not seem to be any definitive evidence that the influence of a magnetic field in a stellar atmosphere ever attains a saturated level . in support of this claim ,",
    "we note that the response of stellar chromospheres to non - thermal heating mechanisms is continuous and monotonically increasing from basal chromospheres to flaring chromospheres ( e.g. houdebine 1992 , houdebine & doyle 1994a , houdebine & doyle 1994b , houdebine et al .",
    "1995 , houdebine & stempels 1997 , houdebine 2009 , houdebine 2010 ) .",
    "therefore , the two different types of racs we find below for the low and high activity stars respectively highlight the different properties of the dynamo mechanisms in these two types of stars .",
    "it seems to us that in order to study the properties of stellar dynamos most profitably , it would be preferable to concentrate as much as possible on stars in the _ unsaturated _ regime .",
    "the reason for this claim is that , when conditions are saturated , there are extra factors which come into play which may obscure some physical properties that are directly associated with dynamo action . in view of vilhu s identification of a critical period @xmath32 , it seems that the _ slowest _ rotators have the best chance of being in the unsaturated regime .",
    "for that reason , we consider it worthwhile to push the spectroscopic measurements of stellar rotation towards the _ smallest possible values _ of @xmath43 which can be reliably measured .    in general ,",
    "since slow rotation means less chromospheric heating , we expect that the slowest rotators in our dataset will be stars which are low - activity stars classified as dk and dm ( i.e. those which by definition show no emission in the balmer lines ) , while the fastest rotators will be stars which are highly active stars classified as dke and dme ( i.e. those where by definition the balmer lines have an emission core ) . in what follows",
    ", we shall be especially interested in determining the ( negative ) slope of the rac for low - activity stars ( e.g. see fig .  13 below , lower panel ) .",
    "one reason for the present study has emerged from recent work by houdebine & mullan ( 2015 : hereafter hm ) : they found that another diagnostic of magnetic fields , namely , the efficiency of magnetic braking ( which manifests itself in the rotational velocity ) , undergoes a detectable change at spectral sub - type dm3 .",
    "basing their analysis on a new data set of precise rotational velocities , hm found that the mean rotation period of m3 stars is abnormally large compared to those of the adjoining spectral types dm2 and dm4 .",
    "this indicates that the dm3 stars have been slowed down more than the stars in the immediately adjacent sub - types dm2 and dm4 .",
    "this excess slowing at dm3 may be associated with a change in magnetic properties of the stars at dm3 .",
    "specifically , hm suggested that the change might be associated with an earlier report ( mullan et al 2006 ) that the lengths of flaring magnetic loops undergo a significant increase at spectral type dm3 .    in the present paper ,",
    "we extend the work of hm in two distinct ways .",
    "first , we expand the database of precise rotational properties of k and m dwarfs of various sub - types .",
    "second , we expand and analyze a separate database which deals with the second physical parameter which enters into the rac : the radiative properties which are associated with magnetic  activity \" in our sample of rotating stars . our goal here is to use the activity data to construct racs .",
    "moreover , we quantify the racs in two different parts of the stellar atmosphere : the chromosphere ( using the caii lines ) and the corona ( using @xmath44 ) . the present study is based on a larger sample of stars , and a finer grid of spectral sub - types , than have been used previously in constructing racs for k and m stars . our goal is to explore whether the unusual rotational signature reported by hm at dm3 is accompanied by unusual behavior in the activity indicators of either chromosphere or corona or both , either as regards the intensity of the radiation , or as regards the slopes of the racs .",
    "a key physical factor which is known to be well correlated with chromospheric emission and coronal emission has to do with magnetic fields on the stellar surface ( e.g. skumanich et al 1975 ; schrijver et al .",
    "the existence of rac s may be interpreted as an indication that the surface magnetic field intensities are correlated with the stellar rotation rate .",
    "this relationship is to be expected on the basis of standard dynamo theory ( e.g. parker 1979 , krause & radler 1980 , mullan et al . 2015 ) .",
    "however , most of the observational investigations cited above suffer from two inadequacies : ( i ) they included only a few stars which are rotating slowly enough to be in the unsaturated regime , and ( ii ) the targets included stars which were spread out over a broad range of spectral types . in this paper , we attempt to remedy both of these inadequacies .      in an effort to extend the racs to slow rotators among late - type dwarfs ,",
    "we have been reporting , over the past several years , improved spectroscopic measurements of rotational broadening @xmath43 in stars of spectral sub - types dk4 ( houdebine 2011a , paper xvi thereafter ) , dk6 ( houdebine et al .",
    "2016 , paper i ) , dm2 ( houdebine 2008 , paper viii , houdebine 2010a , paper xiv ) , dm3 ( hm ) and dm4 ( houdebine 2012a , paper xvii , houdebine et al . 2016 , paper i ) .    combining our ( previous ) rotational measures with our measures of the caii line equivalent widths ( ew ) ,",
    "we have already reported racs for dk4 ( houdebine 2011a , paper xvi ) , dm2 ( houdebine 2011b , paper xv ) and dm4 stars ( houdebine 2012b , paper xviii ) , for slow and rapid rotators alike . in those earlier papers , we proposed empirical racs which included large samples of slow rotators .",
    "we found that for later spectral types it is crucial to examine a fine grid of spectral sub - types .",
    "specifically , we found that the rac s vary significantly between dk4 to dm4 stars : the rac s were found to have different gradients and different saturation levels ( papers xv , xviii and the present study ) .",
    "the previous data , combined with the present study , now provide us with large enough data - sets in each spectral sub - type that we can investigate with improved confidence the differences ( if any ) between the rac s in five different spectral sub - types . in view of the results reported in hm ,",
    "it is notable that the present study enables us to study the rac s in the vicinity of the ttcc .",
    "when we consider _ slow _ rotators , our data confirm that the mean rotation periods of stars in the range dk4-dm4 in general decrease with decreasing effective temperature ( see hm and paper i ) .",
    "however , we also find that something unusual happens in the rotation rates between dm2 and dm4 .",
    "the overall trend towards decreasing rotation period as we go from dk4 to dm4 is interrupted at spectral sub - type dm3 : at that sub - type , the mean rotation period increases to a local peak , such that the mean rotational period at dm3 is _ longer _ than the overall trend between dk4 and dm4 would have predicted ( hm ) .",
    "but when we extend our investigation to include _ fast _ rotators among the dk4-dm4 stars , there is found to be the following overall trend : the mean rotation period tends to increase slightly from dk4 to dm4 .",
    "but once again , at dm3 , an exception is found : the mean rotation period of fast rotators at dm3 is locally significantly _ longer _ than the overall trend would have predicted ( hm ) .",
    "hm interpret these abnormally long rotation periods at sub - type dm3 as possibly being associated with the occurrence of increasing coronal loop lengths ( previously reported by mullan et al .",
    "2006 in a study of flare stars ) .",
    "the mean rotation period of the slow rotators is an important constraint on the temporal history of the dynamo mechanisms and magnetic braking mechanisms ( hm , paper i ) .",
    "an important aspect of the present paper is that we wish to investigate the racs in various formats . in the first place , we construct racs separately for the chromosphere and the corona",
    ". moreover , we explore correlations between various observations of the  activity \" and various aspects of  rotation \" . as an example",
    ", we will examine , for the h and k lines of caii , a plot of the quantity @xmath45 as a function of the rossby number @xmath42 .",
    "we also plot the caii surface flux as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "we use these different formats in an attempt to improve our chances of identifying changes ( if any ) in the dynamo regime in the vicinity of the ttcc . we shall find that changes near the ttcc are more readily detectable in some racs than in others .",
    "this may explain why the empirical detection of the ttcc has been elusive in the past .",
    "stepie ( 1989 , 1993 , 1994 ) has reported that racs exhibit certain differences at different spectral types . as an extension of this finding ,",
    "we have found , in previous studies ( paper xviii , hm ) and also in the present study , that it is important in constructing racs to select samples of stars with @xmath29 values which are confined within a narrow range .",
    "there are two principal reasons for this , one related to the choice of an optimal set of photospheric absorption lines , and the second related to our analysis of chromospheric emission lines .",
    "as regards the choice of photospheric lines , we have already discussed the first of the above reasons at length in paper i in the context of optimizing the measurement of rotational velocities at each spectral subtype between dk4 and dm4 . in the present paper ,",
    "we turn now to the second reason .    in the context of _ chromospheric _",
    "analysis , it is important to deal with stars with closely similar @xmath29 when we are attempting to quantify with as much precision as possible the ew of the chromospheric lines ( caii resonance doublet and h@xmath46 ) .",
    "these lines inevitably include some contributions from the background photospheric continuum and from the temperature minimum region ( e.g. houdebine & doyle 1994 , cram & mullan 1979 , houdebine & stempels 1997 , paper xv ) .",
    "initially , our samples of stars had been selected for the purpose of chromospheric modelling studies ( e.g. houdebine & stempels 1997 , houdebine 2009b paper xii , houdebine 2010b paper ix ) , and in these studies the selection of stars with closely similar spectral types was essential in order to develop reliable grids of semi - empirical model chromospheres , each of which would be superposed on a particular photospheric model .",
    "based on our previous papers , we have found that the most suitable initial selection parameter when we wish to identify a homogeneous sample of k or m dwarfs belonging to a specific sub - type is the ( r - i ) color : this color is sensitive to @xmath29 , but less so to metallicity ( e.g. leggett 1992 , ramirez & melendez 2005 , mann et al .",
    ". moreover , broad - band colors of high precision are widely available in the literature for many of the cool dwarfs which are of interest to us .    in the present paper , as an example of how we selected data for our rac studies , we now describe how we gathered the relevant data for a sample of dk6 stars .",
    "we selected a sample of 419 late k dwarfs on the basis of ( r - i ) measurements available in the literature .",
    "for example , our sample of dk6 stars ( see table  1 below ) contains stars with ( r - i)@xmath47 ( i.e. ( r - i ) color in the cousins system ) in the range [ 0.684;0.816 ] which also corresponds to ( r - i)@xmath48 ( ( r - i ) in the kron system ) in the range [ 0.503;0.613 ] according to the transformation formulae of leggett ( 1992 ) ( see leggett 1992 for more information on the cousin s and kron photometric systems ) . according to kenyon and hartmann ( 1995 ) , this range of colors is centered on ( r - i)@xmath47=0.75 , i.e. the spectral type dk7 . however , when we compiled and derived effective temperatures ( see paper i ) for this sample of late - k dwarfs , we found in average higher temperatures than what would be expected from the ( r - i)@xmath47-@xmath29 tabulation of kenyon and hartmann ( 1995 ) ( see paper i )",
    ". our dk6 stellar sample contains stars that have similar ( r - i)@xmath49 colours and the same effective temperatures to within @xmath50110 k ( see paper i ) .",
    "we refer to hm for a discussion of corresponding data for our sample of dm3 stars .",
    "the literature provided us with a starting list of a large number ( 419 ) of late - k dwarfs .",
    "searching through databases at the european southern observatory ( eso ) and observatoire de haute provence ( ohp ) , we identified spectra of 112 different stars which are suitable for our purposes .",
    "the final list of 105 stars for which the available spectra would allow us to determine reliable rotational data ( i.e. @xmath43 values ) in our sample of late - k dwarfs has already been provided in paper i. for the present paper , we found spectra which would allow us to make reliable measurements of the ews of caii and h@xmath46 for a sub - sample of only 89 late - k dwarfs .",
    "it is the combination of reliable rotations ( paper i ) and reliable ews of chromospheric lines which enable us to undertake , in the present paper , the study of the rac in our sub - sample of dk6 dwarfs .",
    "the spectra which we use for determining the caii and h@xmath46 equivalent widths in the present study of dk4-dm4 stars came from three different chelle spectrographs ; harps ( high accuracy radial velocity planet search , eso ) , sophie ( ohp ) and feros ( the fiber - fed extended range optical spectrograph ) .",
    "we included in our sample the sophie observations obtained in the high efficiency ( he ) mode .",
    "the modes in which the spectra were obtained are indicated in table  1 together with the corresponding signal to noise ( s / n ) ratio . for further details of the spectrographs , see hm .    as a second example of",
    "how we selected pertinent data for our spectral sub - samples , we consider here briefly our sample of dm3 stars .",
    "as described in hm , westarted off with a list of 381 dm3 objects based on ( r - i ) data in the literature .",
    "searching through the same databases as above , we found suitable observations which allowed us to determine reliable @xmath43 values for 86 different dm3 stars .",
    "a subsequent search of the available spectra in the above databases allowed us to obtain reliable measurements of the ews of caii and h@xmath46 for a sub - sample of only 59 m3 dwarfs for our chromospheric rac ( excluding probable spectroscopic binaries and low @xmath51 stars ) .",
    "the stars in our samples include all stars from all observing programs which have been carried out with harps and sophie for stars belonging to the following spectral sub - types : dk4 , dk6 , dm2 , and dm3 . for dm4 stars we compiled all measurements of @xmath43 available in the literature",
    "( see paper i ) . for the dk6 and dm3 samples , we also supplemented our own measurements with measurements available in the literature , notably for active stars ( see paper i ) .    in the harps and sophie databases ,",
    "many of the spectra were obtained in connection with planet - search programs . in such programs ,",
    "observers tend to avoid stars with high levels of magnetic activity .",
    "therefore our spectral samples are likely to be biased in general towards low activity stars , i.e. stars which are in the unsaturated portions of the racs . for reasons outlined above ( see section 1.1 ) , we consider this bias to be an advantage in the present study .",
    "the biases in our samples may contribute somewhat to the density of the sampling at different parts of the rac , but this is not expected to cause significant discrepancies as regards the overall racs .",
    "note that for the dm4 and dk6 samples , the sampling of the racs should be more complete as regards the measures of @xmath0 ( because we included other measures of @xmath43 from the literature , see paper  i ) .",
    "in this section , we first ( sub - section 3.1 ) evaluate the surface fluxes in the continuum in the vicinity of the caii resonance doublet by using our estimates of @xmath29 and also by using the synthetic spectra of de laverny et al .",

    "then , we construct the racs of m and k dwarfs using a variety of approaches : some approaches may facilitate the extraction of information that is more difficult to extract by means of other approaches . in all of the approaches , we plot a quantity related to  activity \" as the ordinate , and a quantity related to  rotation \" as the abscissa .    our first approach ( sub - sections 3.2 , 3.3 , 3.4 , 3.5 , and 3.6 ) specifies the  activity \" of a star in terms of the surface fluxes of chromospheric lines . combining these surface flux results with our results for @xmath0 ( paper i ) ,",
    "we construct a set of racs for m and k dwarfs belonging to various spectral sub - types ( see figs . 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , and 12 ) .",
    "we first analyze the rac for k4 and k6 dwarfs .",
    "then we re - visit the rac in m2 dwarfs that was first investigated in paper  xv .",
    "we then analyse the rac in m3 dwarfs for which @xmath43 measures were reported in hm and for which we present new measurements of the chromospheric line equivalent widths here .",
    "we also re - visit the rac in m4 dwarfs that was studied in paper xviii with the new values of the stellar parameters determined in paper i. finally , we compare the racs for five spectral k and m subtypes , dk4 , dk6 , dm2 , dm3 and dm4 , and draw conclusions about the differential variations of the rac from mid - k dwarfs to m4 dwarfs .",
    "we emphasize that our racs are plotted as a function of the projected rotation period @xmath0 and not the rotation period @xmath31 .",
    "the average @xmath51 is 0.6 .",

    "switching our attention to the corona ( sub - section 3.10 ) , we construct a different type of rac for our targets , this time referring to conditions in the corona , rather than the chromosphere .",
    "the coronal rac is obtained by plotting @xmath44/@xmath52 as a function of the rossby number ( fig .",
    "16 ) . comparing  activity \" in chromosphere and corona ( sub - section 3.11 ; figs .",
    "17 , 18 ) can provide information as to how any given m dwarf star partitions its deposition of mechanical energy between chromosphere and corona . to quantify this partition , in sub - section 3.11 we examine the correlations between @xmath44 and @xmath53 ( see figs .",

    "s calibrated in terms of absolute energy fluxes , rather than confining our attention to the values of the equivalent width ( ew ) .",
    "( nevertheless , the ew have proven useful in terms of surface magnetic fields : see mullan et al .",
    "2015 . ) in order to convert from ew to energy fluxes , we calculated the surface fluxes in the continuum in the vicinity of the caii lines from the theoretical model atmospheres of de laverny et al .",

    "( 2010)grid@xmath54flux/ ] for @xmath55 , [ m / h]=0.0 and @xmath13=0.0 .",
    "we found that in m2 , m3 and m4 dwarfs , for our observations , the continuum at about 3950     represents a good evaluation of the background continuum flux for the ca ii lines .",
    "but there are significant discrepancies between the observations and the models of de laverny et al .",
    "we show a spectrum of a dm2 star ( gl 205 ) in fig .  1 together with the model of de laverny et al .",
    "( 2012 ) for an effective temperature of 3500  k. we normalised these two spectra at 1 for the continuum flux at 3950   .",
    "as one can see in this figure , there are large differences in the continuum fluxes at 3910    and 4000    between the model and the observation .",
    "we believe these differences are due to missing opacities in the models .",
    "we also show in the lower panel of fig .",
    "1 the spectrum of gl 570a together with the model for an effective temperature of 4500  k. here again we note important differences : in the spectrum of gl 570a , the continuum flux at 3950    is not a good estimate of the continuum flux in the vicinity of the caii lines . in this case , one has to interpolate between the fluxes at 3910    and 4000   .",
    "therefore , for our estimates of the theoretical surface fluxes in the vicinity of the caii lines for m2 , m3 and m4 dwarfs , we took the average of the flux at 3950    and the value interpolated between 3910    and 4000   .",
    "for k6 and k4 dwarfs , we used the value interpolated between 3910    and 4000   .    using this approach",
    ", we found that the mean surface fluxes in the continuum in the vicinity of the caii lines are : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 for dk4 , dk6 , dm2 , dm3 and dm4 stars respectively .",
    "the strong decline ( factor of @xmath6130 ) in surface flux in the violet with decreasing @xmath29 from dk4 to dm4 is apparent in these numbers . using these figures , we are now in a position to examine quantitatively how the surface fluxes in the caii lines behave as a function of @xmath0 . in the subsequent sections ,",
    "the caii surface fluxes were computed for each star according to its effective temperature .",
    "we expect that the models give estimates of the continuum surface fluxes with a precision of the order of 40% .",
    "as mentioned above , this figure is far below the factor of @xmath6130 in the continuum surface fluxes in the violet with decreasing @xmath29 from dk4 to dm4 .",
    "therefore , the decline in the caii surface fluxes that we observe below ( see figure 14 ) in the racs from dk4 to dm4 is highly significant .      in this subsection",
    ", we re - investigate the racs in our sample of dk4 stars , that was first investigated in houdebine ( 2012b , paper xviii ) .",
    "we re - iterate that the racs are of fundamental importance in order to constrain an essential parameter of the dynamo mechanism(s ) : the role played by rotation . in our previous studies ( e.g. paper vii , paper xiv , paper xvi , paper xvii , hm ) , we reported on our results for @xmath43 and @xmath0 for stars of low activity level ( i.e. slow rotators ) for the spectral sub - types dk4 , dm2 , dm3 and dm4 . in paper i",
    "we have reported similar rotational data for dk6 stars .",
    "combining these rotational data with the surface fluxes of chromospheric lines in dk and dm starsstars provides a unique opportunity to investigate the racs in a fine - grained sample of m and k dwarfs which are sub - divided across five closely - spaced , but distinct , spectral sub - types .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "2 the rac which we have obtained for our dk4 stars . in previously published studies of racs in cool dwarfs , the majority of the results were reported in terms of homoscedastic linear least square fits ( lsf ) in order to fit their observations . in the present study",
    ", we propose different approaches .",
    "first , we perform homoscedastic linear and quadratic least square fits to our samples of low+high activity stars ( dk+dke or dm+dme ) .",
    "second , we perform heteroscedastic linear and quadratic least square fits ( lsf that account for measurement errors , see the appendix ) to our samples of low+high activity stars .",
    "third , we also compute homoscedastic and heteroscedastic linear least square fits to two particular sub - sets of our data , namely , stars in which activity is at a low level ( dk , dm ) and at a high level ( dke , dme ) respectively .",
    "we inter - compare the results of these fits for various spectral sub - types in turn in this subsection and in the following subsections .",
    "as we shall see , these various fits allow us to account for the complexity of our data sets . in our least - square fits",
    ", we do not include in general the suspected low @xmath51 stars , lower limits or spectroscopic binaries .",
    "however , in the present sub - section , for dk4 stars , it appears that some of the lower limit measurements do correlate with the other measurements of dk4 stars .",
    "therefore , we included some of these measurements in our correlations ( we did not include obvious outliers ) .",
    "the heteroscedastic linear least - squares fit to the data in fig .",
    "2 is shown by the solid line .",
    "the equation for the solid line in fig .",
    "2 is as follows :    @xmath62    the @xmath63 for the fit in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is only 0.033 for our sample of 34 dk4+dk4e stars .",
    "the statistical significance of this fit is 99.9% ( see table  1 ) .",
    "( results of all least - squares fits for this and subsequent spectral sub - types can be found in table 1 . )",
    "the homoscedastic linear least - squares fit yields similar results :    @xmath64    the @xmath63 for this fit is 0.032 for 34 dk4+dk4e stars . the correlation coefficient for this fit is found to be 0.884 and the statistical significance of the correlation is at least 99.9% ( see table  1 ) .",
    "therefore , these two fits are highly statistically significant .",
    "the reason for studying heteroscedastic fits in addition to the homoscedastic fits is that our @xmath0 measurements have large errors and these errors vary as a function of the values of @xmath65 ( rapid rotators have smaller errors than slow rotators ) .",
    "the presence of these variable errors may yield heteroscedastic fits that are in some regards different from the homoscedastic fits .",
    "we shall see examples of this statement in some of the following subsections .",
    "two aspects of the fits in eqs . ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) will be referred to in the subsequent discussion .",
    "first , the exponent of @xmath0 will be referred to as the  rac slope \" in a plot of @xmath66 versus @xmath67 .",
    "systematic changes in the numerical value of the rac slope will lead us to an important conclusion of the present paper .",
    "second , the numerical coefficient closest to the equals sign is a measure of the absolute level of the chromospheric emission among the stars in the sample .",
    "systematic changes in the numerical value of the coefficient will also be an important conclusion of this paper .",
    "so far in this sub - section , we have done an analysis of all of our dk4 stars , i.e. we have combined both the dk4 stars and the dk4e stars into a single sample .",
    "now we split our sample up into two groups ( dk4 in one , dk4e in the second ) , and analyze each group separately .",
    "specifically , we now apply heteroscedastic and homoscedastic linear lsf to the sub - samples of only the low activity stars ( dk4 ) and then repeat the exercise including only the high activity stars ( dk4e ) ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the reason for performing these separate fits is that we found that the linear fits did not reproduce well both the low activity and high activity sub - samples : this result led us to wonder if these two samples might contain different dynamo modes . if it turns out that indeed different dynamo modes are at work in slow rotators and fast rotators , then separate analyses of the data sets is warranted .",
    "we find that the linear heteroscedastic lsf to the dk4 low activity stars yield :    @xmath68    the @xmath63 for this fit is 0.034 for our sample of 30 dk4 stars and the statistical significance of the correlation is at least 99.9% ( see table  1 ) .",
    "this fit is shown as the straight dot - dashed line in fig .  2 .",
    "for the homoscedastic fit , we obtain :    @xmath69    the @xmath63 for this fit is only 0.031 for 30 dk4 stars , the correlation coefficient is 0.744 and the statistical significance is at least 99.9% ( see table  1 ) . therefore , both of these fits ( homo and hetero ) are highly statistically significant in spite of the scatter in the data .",
    "we note that the differences between the homoscedastic and the heteroscedastic fits fall within the uncertainties of the parameters of the fits .",
    "the linear heteroscedastic lsf to the dk4e high activity stars yield :    @xmath70    the @xmath63 for this fit is 0.038 for 4 dk4e stars and the statistical significance is 99.7% ( see table  1 ) .",
    "this fit is shown as the upper dot - dashed straight line in fig .  2 .",
    "we must admit that our dk4e sample contains only 4 stars and that therefore the rac for dk4e stars is not well constrained .",
    "however , as we shall see in the subsequent sub - sections , we find that this rac is consistent with the trend of the high activity star racs at other spectral types .    an important feature of our results emerges when we compare eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , and when we compare eqs . ( 2 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) . whether we consider homo- or hetero - scedastic results , we find that the gradient of the rac for the low activity stars alone ( -0.57 , -0.64 ) is shallower in magnitude than that of the combined sample of low+high activity stars ( -0.81 , -0.76 ) , and that the gradient of the rac for the high activity stars alone ( -1.88 , -1.877 ) is larger in magnitude than that of the combined sample of low+high activity stars ( -0.81 , -0.76 )",
    ". we shall find that this occurs systematically between the low activity sub - samples and the full samples for all five of our spectral sub - types ( see table  1 and sections 3.3 - 3.6 below ) .",
    "the effect is more pronounced as the spectral type increases ( see also sect .",
    "3.7 ) . for the high activity sub - samples",
    ", we shall find that the slope is steeper than that of the combined samples for dk4 , dk6 and dm2 stars , but that it reverses for the dm3 and dm4 stars ( at the ttcc and beyond ) and becomes shallower than that of the combined samples . as a consequence , the linear fits to the combined samples of low+high activity stars tend to overestimate the slope in the low activity sub - samples , and underestimate the slopes in the high activity stars sub - samples for dk4 , dk6 and dm2 stars .",
    "therefore , we also performed homoscedastic and heteroscedastic quadratic lsf to our samples of low+high activity stars for our five spectral sub - types .",
    "the quadratic fits allow us to reproduce both the shallower gradient of the linear lsf among the low activity stars as well as the higher fluxes among the high activity stars .",
    "this shows that the quadratic fit may give a better description of the data than the linear fit for the combined samples of low+high activity stars .",
    "however , according to an anonymous referee comments , the quadratic fits may not be significantly different from the results of the linear fits . to argue on this point ,",
    "the referee performed a simulation on sub - samples of dm and dme stars with random errors typical of those we find in this study .",
    "the referee found also a shallower slope among his sub - sample of slow rotators .",
    "given the evidence at hand , the signatures identified as possible evidences supporting the case for a quadratic fits are most probably due to random errors working in combination with a fairly narrow @xmath71 ) domain as compared to those errors .",
    "therefore , although the slopes of the high activity sub - samples in dk4 , dk6 and dm2 are in favor of a quadratic description of the data , we can not yet conclude that quadratic fits represent definitely a better representation of the full datasets .",
    "we can also note that the @xmath63s are comparable between linear and quadratic fits .",
    "more data will be required to conclude .",
    "as an anonymous referee rightly pointed to , if the data are localized to a domain that is only 2 - 3 times as large as a typical error bar , random measurement errors can easily randomize the data and weaken the slope of any true correlation . however , this point is not statistically correct . if the distribution of the errors is gaussian ( which we assume here ) , then the correct parameter to compare to the rac domain @xmath72 is @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the number of measures .",
    "the value of @xmath75 is 17.2 for our low activity dk4 star sample which is far larger the values of 2 - 3 mentionned above .",
    "it appears that @xmath75 lies in the range 17 to 40 for our low activity and high activity racs .",
    "the levels of confidence of a given lsf depends not only on the mean error but _ alo on the number of measures_. therefore , our lsfs should be established to a fairly high level of confidence , which is confirmed by the high statistical significances that we obtained for our least square fits ( see table  1 ) . nevertheless , the simulation of the referee is of interest to us .",
    "we take this important point into account and we emphasize here the preliminary character of our results .",
    "indoubtedly , these interesting results should be comfirmed with additional data , obtained preferably with a higher resolution spectrograph for the slow rotators such as espresso ( eso , @xmath76 ) . therefore , in the following sub - sections and sect .",
    "3.7 , our results on the separate fits to the sub - samples of low and high activity stars should be considered with caution and are only preliminary .",
    "they should be confirmed with larger stellar samples .      in this subsection",
    ", we discuss the results for our sample of dk6 stars . for the sake of consistency with previous measurements in this series of papers , and to avoid duplication in describing the method",
    ", we refer the reader to papers vi and xv to see how we evaluate the ew for the caii resonance doublet and the h@xmath46 line . in table 2",
    ", we list the ew we have obtained for the caii resonance doublet and for the h@xmath46 line for our dk6 stars .",
    "we note that our dk6 stellar sample contains only one star with h@xmath77 definitely in emission ( i.e. a dk6e star ) : gl  517 ( eq vir ) , with the fastest rotation ( @xmath43 = @xmath78 , @xmath31/sin@xmath79 = 3.05 days , see paper i ) .",
    "our  dk6 \" sample also includes one star of  intermediate \" activity with h@xmath46 neither in emission nor absorption ( i.e. a dk6(e ) star ) : gl  208 ( table  2 ) .",
    "as regards eq vir , this star has been classified in the literature as a dk5 star .",
    "in fact , gl 517 is a by  dra star with colours which vary with time ( depending on spot coverage ) .",
    "our observations contain many slow rotators but very few fast rotators ( dke stars ) .",

    "we also searched the literature for other measurements of the caii ew .",
    "we found only a few measurements of the caii ew or flux for our dk6 stars ( marilli et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , rutten ( 1987 ) , duncan et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , browning et al .",
    "( 2010 ) ) .",
    "these measures are also listed in table  2 .",
    "we saw in paper  xv ( see also sect .",
    "3.4 ) that correction for metallicity effects in dm2 stars is essential in order to obtain a good correlation between the caii ew and @xmath0 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the caii line formation depends sensitively on the ca abundance ( houdebine & panagi 2016 , in preparation ) . here",
    "the same applies to dk6 stars and to the ca ii surface fluxes . in paper i we compiled [ m / h ] measures for our dk6 stellar sample and here we computed the caii surface fluxes corrected for metallicity effects , assuming a proportionality between [ m / h ] and caii surface fluxes .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "3 the rac which we have obtained for our dk6 stars .",
    "the heteroscedastic linear lsf to the data in fig .  3",
    "is shown by the solid line .",
    "one of the stars in our sample , gl  208 ( a dm6(e ) star with @xmath31/sin@xmath79 = 8.94 days ) , is probably also a fast rotator : but its value of @xmath43 is too small ( and its value of @xmath0 is too large ) to be entirely consistent with its observed activity level .",
    "it is possible that we are viewing this star close to its rotation axis , i.e. @xmath51 may be atypically low .",
    "we also report on two relatively active stars with a rather slow rotation : gl  455.1 and gl  907.1 .",
    "these stars depart noticeably from the main correlation .",
    "we believe that these stars also have low @xmath51 .",
    "most of the other stars follow the solid - line correlation fairly well with a few exceptions : a group of stars that lie below the main correlation and are low activity - fast rotators . one of them is a subdwarf : their internal structure may cause their dynamos to operate differently from those in main sequence k stars . for the few other stars ,",
    "similar discrepancies from the rac have been found in dm2 stars ( paper xv and sect .",
    "3.4 below ) ; they will also be noted among dm3 stars ( see sect .",
    "3.5 below )",
    ". reiners et al .",
    "( 2012 ) also observed a few stars which are discrepant compared to the global trend : reiners et al .",
    "disregarded such objects as being due to measurement errors .",
    "however , the repetition with which they appear in our samples , and the fact that they are relatively rapidly rotating , lead us to believe that these _ low - activity relatively fast rotators _ may indeed exist as a possibly significant sub - set of late k and m dwarfs .",
    "the best explanation we have is that , in a star such as gl  412.3ab , which exhibits a slight asymmetry when its photospheric spectral lines are subjected to rotational analysis ( see paper i ) , these stars may be unresolved spectroscopic binaries : as such , they could yield abnormally broadened cross - correlation profiles ( see also gl  186ab in paper i ) . therefore these stars are probably spectroscopic binaries that are unresolved at the time the observations were made .",
    "this is quite plausible since binarity is a common characteristic of late - type dwarfs .",
    "we label these stars as spectroscopic binaries in fig .  3 .",
    "including the known binaries in our dk6 sample , the number of probable spectroscopic binaries yield a proportion of 20% binaries in our full sample .",
    "this is consistent with the recent finding of ward - duoung et al .",
    "( 2015 ) that binary stars constitute a percentage of about 25% of their stellar sample for @xmath81 .",
    "we shall see in the subsequent subsections that the proportion of binaries amounts to about 28% , 37% and 48% for our dm2 , dm3 and dm4 stellar samples respectively .",
    "our dm2 and dm3 results are again compatible with the fraction of about 32 - 37% derived by ward - duoung et al .",
    "( 2015 ) for these stars . for our dm4 sample , our figure of 48% is somewhat larger than the 37% fraction expected at this spectral type .",
    "this disagreement may find a simple explanation in the bias in detecting parallaxes for nearby m dwarfs . indeed , faint single m4 dwarfs are much more difficult to detect than the companions to nearby brighter m and k dwarfs .",
    "therefore , our dm4 sample , which is largely based on parallax surveys of nearby dwarfs is biased towards the detection of faint companions to nearby brighter m and k dwarfs .",
    "this should explain why we have a larger binary fraction for the m4 dwarf sample .",
    "we should like to emphasize four points regarding the plot in fig .",
    "( i ) metallicity differences from star to star contribute to the scatter about the dk6 rac in fig .  3 . by analogy , in paper  xv we reported that metallicity differences among dm2 stars are responsible for the greater part of the scatter in the rac .",
    "( ii ) another contribution to the scatter is that our statistics on the caii line ew are poor ; we have very few measures of the caii line ew for most of our dk6 stars compared to what we have for the stars in our dm2 sample , and the caii line ew is known to vary with rotation and with the phase of the activity cycle ( e.g. baliunas et al . 1995 ) .",
    "however , we have little or no information as to which part of the cycle our observations happened to ",
    "catch \" any particular star .",
    "( iii ) the value of @xmath51 may vary from 1 to 0 and certainly contributes to the scatter in fig .",
    "( iv ) the range of effective temperatures in our dk6 sample is somewhat larger than in our samples of dm2 , dm3 and dm4 stars ( e.g. only @xmath82  k in dm3 stars , where @xmath29 ranges from 3210 to 3350  k ) .",
    "we would like to emphasize as well that a few of the active stars in our dk6 stellar sample are candidate young stars that may not yet have contracted to the main - sequence ( ms ) .",
    "a reliable way to identify the pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars in our samples is the stellar radius : the fact is , pms stars that have not yet contracted to the ms have abnormally large radii .",
    "we identified three such stars in our dk6 sample : gj 1177a , gj 182 and gj 425b are possible pms stars ( see paper i ) .",
    "however , gl 425b is a rather low activity star . as such ,",
    "the abnormally large radius for this star is probably due to binarity .",
    "nevertheless , we find that these stars _ do correlate well with the ms stars_. in our m2 sample ( see next section ) , we have identified also two pms stars : gj 1264 and gj 803 . but",
    "again , as we shall see , these pms stars do correlate very well with the other ms stars . in our m3 sample ,",
    "gj 277a is a possible pms star . in our m4 sample ,",
    "gj 2069a , gj 3322 , gj 669a , gj 695b , gj 812a are possible pms stars according to their radii .",
    "_ we emphasize that all these stars do not rotate especially fast .",
    "there are many ms stars that rotate faster . _",
    "these pms stars are expected actually to spin up as they contract to the ms , and young ms stars are expected to be the fastest rotators ( e.g. barnes 2003 ; for a theoretical model of this process , see e.g. fig .  2 in macdonald & mullan 2003 ) .",
    "that is what we actually observe in our samples of stars : young ms stars are the fastest rotators ( e.g. among our m4 sample ; gj 3631 , gj 3789 , gj 4020b , gj 4338b , gj 431 , gj 630.1 , gj 791.2a ) with @xmath43 in excess of 15 @xmath83 and up to 56 @xmath83 .",
    "all our racs demonstrate that pms stars do not stand out as significantly different from the main correlations of the ms stars ( see subsequent sections ) .",
    "numerous previous studies also found similar results : e.g. mamajek & hillebrand ( 2008 ) , browning et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , christian et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , west et al .",
    "this finding is rather intriguing since pms stars may have internal structures which differ from those of ms stars : in fact , some pms stars may even be fully convective . more investigation is required to confirm this result , but so far , in our samples , we found no definitive evidence that pms stars obey different racs from those of ms stars .",
    "the heteroscedastic linear lsf to the rac in fig .",
    "3 gives the following :    @xmath84    the parameters of this lsf are given in table  1 .",
    "the @xmath63 is 0.093 and the statistical significance is 99.9% for 55 dk6 stars .",

    "we find in this case that the heteroscedastic and the homoscedastic linear fits give slightly different results for the slope and for the flux amplitude : this is due to the fact that high activity stars ( fast rotators ) have smaller uncertainties in @xmath0 compared to low activity stars , and this give them much higher weights in the least square fit . as a result",
    ", the heteroscedastic linear solution fits the high activity stars better , whereas the homoscedastic linear solution clearly underestimates the fluxes among high activity stars .",

    ", we note that in fig .",
    "3 , the correlation in eq .  ( 6 ) spans the entire range of @xmath0 values for which we have dk6 data .",
    "in particular , it is important to notice that the dk6 data exhibit no evidence for a flattening ( or  saturation \" ) of the rac at the shortest periods ( @xmath0 = 1.8 days ) .",
    "this is consistent with previous results for the earlier spectral type ( dk4 ) which also showed no signs of saturation ( see sect .",
    "neither is there evidence for saturation among dm2 stars ( see fig .  5 below ) .",
    "having analyzed the combined samples of slow and fast rotators , we now turn to performing heteroscedastic and homoscedastic linear lsf on the sub - samples of low activity stars ( dk6 ) and high activity stars ( dk6e ) separately .",

    "this fit is shown as the straight dot - dashed line in the upper right portion of fig .",
    "we again find that the gradient of the rac for the low activity stars alone ( -0.86 , -0.64 ) seems shallower than that of the low+high activity star sample ( -1.05 , -0.81 ) and that the gradient of the rac for the high activity stars alone ( -1.402 , -1.364 ) seems steeper than that of the low+high activity star sample ( -1.05 , -0.81 ) .",
    "we find that this difference in rac steepness occurs systematically between the low activity sub - samples and the full samples for all five of our spectral sub - types ( see table  1 and sections 3.4 - 3.6 below ) .",

    "however , we consider these results as still preliminary because the domains of the racs are relatively small compared to the typical uncertainties on individual measures .",
    "if this difference between the racs of the low and high activity sub - samples is confirmed to be true , this may represent a discovery of interest : indeed , to the extent that the slope of an rac is related in some way to an underlying dynamo process , the difference which we found between the slopes of the low and high activity sub - samples suggests that there may exist two different dynamo regimes for these two sub - samples of stars .",
    "we find that this difference between low and high activity regimes persists for all our samples of stars with different spectral sub - types .",
    "however , we observe a difference for stars which are more massive than the ttcc and stars which are less massive than the ttcc . for the former ,",

    "most of the subdwarfs also lie significantly apart from most of the m2 dwarfs .",
    "most of this large scatter is due to metallicity effects on the caii line formation .",
    "we used the empirical correlation found by houdebine ( 2008 , paper vii ) to determine the metallicity for each star as a function of its radius ( see paper  i ) .",
    "we use these values here to correct the caii surface fluxes for metallicity effects , assuming a proportionality between surface flux and metallicity ( optically thin case ) . the caii line ew ,",

    "even subdwarfs correlate with normal metallicity dwarfs .    in fig . 5 , we plot the uncertainties on @xmath0 as dotted lines for each star . for these uncertainties",

    "as already mentioned in the previous section , these stars are probably unresolved spectroscopic binaries .",

    "there are also a few stars that have too long rotation periods for their surface fluxes .",

    "these stars are shown as squares in fig .",
    "the heteroscedastic linear lsf to the rac in fig .",

    "the correlation coefficient is 0.949 and the @xmath63 is 0.018 for 66 dm2 stars .",
    "the gradient of this correlation ( -1.481 ) is very close to that of the correlation found in paper  xv ( -1.53 ) .",
    "in fact there are few differences between the two results : the correlation has only been shifted slightly in @xmath0 .",
    "both the homoscedastic and the heteroscedastic give highly significant correlations with a statistical significance better than 99.9% .",
    "the heteroscedastic linear fit yields a somewhat slightly larger slope than the homoscedastic linear fit .",
    "this is because the errors on the dm2e stars are significantly smaller than those of the dm2 stars , and therefore the weights of the dm2e stars in the correlations are larger than those of dm2 stars in the heteroscedastic fit . as a consequence , the heteroscedastic fit goes through the sub - sample of dm2e stars whereas the homoscedastic fit underestimates clearly the higher fluxes of the dm2e stars .",

    "the heteroscedastic linear lsf to the dm2e high activity star sub - sample yields :    @xmath99    therefore , the slope of the rac for the high activity dm2e stars is again steeper than that of the combined sample of low+high activity stars .",
    "we note that this slope gets closer to that of the combined sample as we move from dk4 to dm2 .",
    "the differences between these two slopes were larger for dk4 and dk6 stars .",
    "the parameter @xmath75 is 23.45 for the high activity star sub - sample and 34.77 for the low activity star sub - sample .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath89 which is a normalized estimate of the mean error on the measurements is much smaller than the period domains of the racs in both cases .",

    "in order to have an unbiased sample of measurements , we searched the literature for additional @xmath43 and caii measurements : we found several additional stars with @xmath43 measurements ( see paper  i ) .",

    "1989 , rutten et al .",
    "instead , we found several measures of the @xmath4 ew ( soderblom et al .",

    "one can see in this figure that the scatter is very large among both dm3 and dm3e stars .",
    "the same kind of scatter was observed among the raw data of dm2 stars ( fig .",
    "4 ) . considering the good correction we had for the metallicity in the previous section for dm2 stars",
    ", we decided to compile all the metallicities published for our initial selection list of 381 dm3 stars , and try to obtain a metallicity - radius correlation for these stars , similarly to the dm2 stars in paper  vii .",
    "we found metallicities from the literature for 147 dm3 stars .",
    "this data and the radius-[m / h ] relationship were reported in paper  i. data for m3 stars corrected for metallicity can be found in table 5 and fig .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "8 the rac corrected for metallicity effects for dm3 stars .",
    "the scatter is reduced compared to the raw data in fig .  7 , but there remains a significant scatter among both dm3 and dm3e stars .",
    "the corrected correlation is not as good as for dm2 stars .",
    "we believe this is due partly to the poorer statistics we have on the caii line ews .",
    "indeed , for dm3 stars we have very few measurements of the caii lines ews ( table  4 ) , whereas for dm2 stars we had several measurements for almost all stars ( see houdebine et al . 2012c , paper xix ) .",
    "we also observe a larger scatter in the radius-[m / h ] relationship for dm3 stars ( see paper  i ) compared to dm2 stars .",
    "this may also lead to poorer corrections of the metallicity effects on the rac .",
    "we observe among our sample of dm3 stars a sub - sample of relatively fast rotating - low activity stars . again , as in the case of dm2 stars , we believe that these stars are unresolved spectroscopic binaries .",
    "we also found three stars with possibly low @xmath43 ( see fig .",
    "8) . in the corrected rac ,",
    "most of the subdwarfs now follow the same correlation as normal dwarfs , indicating that our metallicity corrections are reasonably correct .",
    "we find that for periods above 7 days or so , the gradient between the dm3 stars ( open circles : the slowest rotators ) and the dm3e stars ( filled circles : the fastest rotators ) is very steep . because we have only a few dm3e stars compared to the larger group of dm3 stars , we do not obtain a good linear lsf to both the dm3 and dm3e sub - samples .",
    "this is due to the fact that the linear lsf to the dm3 sub - sample gives a shallower gradient ( -0.90 , table  1 ) compared to the dm3+dm3e sample .",
    "therefore , we gave higher weights to our dm3e data points : we find that a weight of 7 to dm3e stars and 1 to dm3 stars gives a good fit to both data sub - samples . for @xmath31/sin@xmath79 @xmath101 days",
    "we obtain the following heteroscedastic linear lsf for our dm3+dm3e sample ( table  1 ) :    @xmath102    the gradient in eq .",
    "( 17 ) ( -2.02@xmath500.11 ) is significantly steeper than the gradients which we determined for our dk4 and dk6 samples ( -0.814@xmath500.059 and -1.047@xmath500.042 respectively : see figs . 2 and 3 ) . but",
    "interestingly , the mean gradient in fig .  8 is intermediate between that of dm2 stars ( -1.575@xmath500.058 ) and that of dm4 stars ( -2.56@xmath500.19 : table  1 ) . once again , this is an encouraging sign that the physical parameters we have derived for dm3 stars are plausible when compared with stars which are slightly hotter and slightly cooler .",
    "we plot the linear lsf for stars with periods @xmath103 days ( we refer to these as unsaturated stars : see below ) in fig .  8 ( solid line ) .    for the homoscedastic fit we obtain the following linear lsf for our dm3+dm3e sample ( table  1 ) :    @xmath104    the slopes of both the heteroscedastic and the homoscedastic linear fits are comparable . note that the uncertainty on the slope is smaller for the heteroscedastic fit than for the homoscedastic fit .",
    "both fits confirm that the slope of the rac is getting steeper as we move to later spectral types .    as we saw in sect .",
    "1.4 , one would expect the rac to flatten out for rotation periods shorter than 2 - 10 days .",
    "we have several objects in our m3 sample that have shorter rotation periods .",
    "we note that the rac flattens out (  saturates \" ) for the fastest rotating dm3e stars for @xmath105  days . in this period range",
    ", we find 7 fast rotators with about the same surface flux ( @xmath106 ) which corresponds to the maximum observed in the unsaturated portion of the rac .",
    "although in the present data set we do not have enough data to clearly confirm the presence of a saturation plateau , one should expect saturation to occur among some of our sample stars according to previous investigations .",
    "we propose that saturation in our present dm3 sample occurs at about @xmath107 days , which agrees with the expectations of saturation occuring in the range 2 - 10 days . in fig .",
    "8 we therefore represent the fits of the rac in the  unsaturated \" portion , and draw a flat plateau in the expected  saturated \" portion of the rac .",
    "the fact that certain stars in our samples probably lie in a saturated regime , while others are found to lie in an unsaturated regime , has a bearing on a methodological point which was made in sect . 1.1 : a study of stellar dynamos is best done ( we believe ) by focussing on stars in an unsaturated regime .",
    "therefore in what follows , the least squares fits which we will present refer only to stars in the unsaturated regime . in this regime ,",
    "the observations show that there exist stars of both low ( dm ) and high ( dme ) activity , so the sample provides access to a range of  dynamo strengths \" .",
    "in contrast , in the saturated regime , only high - activity stars ( dme ) are present .    in the regime of our unsaturated stars , we also performed heteroscedastic and homoscedastic linear lsfs to the separate sub - samples of low activity dm3 and high activity dm3e stars respectively ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the heteroscedastic linear lsf to the dm3 low activity stars ( all of which are in the unsaturated regime ) yields :    @xmath108    therefore , the gradient of the rac for the low activity stars is again much shallower than that of the combined sample of low+high activity stars , and by more than @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , the linear lsf to the combined sample may be somehow inadequate .",
    "we plot the linear lsf to the low activity sub - sample also in fig .  8 ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "the homoscedastic linear lsf to the dm3 low activity stars yields :    @xmath110    both fits yield comparable results within errors .",
    "the @xmath63 for these fits are 0.039 and 0.047 respectively .",
    "both fits are highly statistically significant at a 99.9% confidence level . once again , we see that the slopes of the rac among low - activity dm3 stars ( -0.84 , -0.93 ) are significantly shallower ( by more than 3@xmath111 ) than the slopes of the rac for the combined sample of high and low activity dm3 stars ( -2.02 , -2.08 ) .    turning now to the high activity dm3e stars in the unsaturated regime , we find that the heteroscedastic linear lsf yields :    @xmath112    in contrast to the results we obtained for the k4 , k6 , and m2 samples , this time for the dm3e sub - sample of unsaturated stars , the slope of the rac is _ shallower _ than that of the combined sample of ( unsaturated ) low+high activity stars",
    ". it seems that at the ttcc , the slope of the rac for ( unsaturated ) high activity stars is falling significantly to a value of about -1 .",
    "although there remains some uncertainty on our fit for dm3e stars ( because we have only 8 stars in the unsaturated regime , and with a significant scatter ) , we shall see in the next subsection that this decrease in the steepness of the slope is confirmed in our ( unsaturated ) dm4e sub - sample and is significant above the @xmath109 level ( 23 stars ) .",
    "our m4 sample also confirms that , the slope of the racs for the high activity ( unsaturated ) sub - samples has fallen below the slope of the combined dm+dme samples .",
    "we have also performed lsfs to the full sub - sample of dm3e stars ( unsaturated+saturated ) .",
    "we give the results of the fits in table  1 ( dm3e+sat ) .",
    "the slope for the full sub - sample has fallen to -0.39 which is considerably smaller than the value of -1.04 we found above . however , this conforts us with the idea that at the ttcc , the slope of the rac for dm3e stars is of the same order than that of the slope for the low activity dm3 stars ( see sect .",
    "3.7.6 ) .",
    "the relative invariance of the rac slopes which we have obtained for the linear lsf to the _ low activity stars _ in our 5 stellar samples gives an important degree of credibility to our results .",
    "it is important to note that all of our low - activity stars have been found to lie in the unsaturated regime of the rac , i.e. in the regime where ( we believe ) dynamo theory can best be tested . to the extent that the slope of the rac is determined ( in the unsaturated regime ) by the physical properties of a dynamo ,",
    "our results suggest that there may exist only one dynamo regime for the low activity stars from dk4 to dm4 within errors ( see sect .",
    "the parameter @xmath75 is 18.28 for the high activity star sub - sample and 21.77 for the low activity star sub - sample .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath89 which is a normalized estimate of the mean error on the measurements is much smaller than the period domains of the racs in both cases .",
    "hence , these lsfs should be relatively well established , which corresponds to the high statistical significances we obtain ( table  1 ) . however , these results may still preliminary because the domains of the racs are relatively small compared to the typical uncertainties on individual measures as hilighted by the referee .",

    "might these changes be an indication that the dynamo mechanisms undergo a change at the ttcc , perhaps from an @xmath113 dynamo to an @xmath24 type of dynamo ?",
    "there tends to be more and more high activity - relatively slow rotators when we move to the spectral sub - types dm3 and dm4 , which questions the validity of a single rac for the combined samples at these spectral types .",

    "we also observe among our sample of dm4 stars a sub - sample of relatively fast rotating - low activity stars . again , as in the case of dm2 and dm3 stars , we believe that these stars are unresolved spectroscopic binaries .",
    "we also found a few stars with possibly low @xmath51 ( see fig .",
    "we find that when we apply the linear heteroscedastic and homoscedastic lsfs to the combined dm4+dm4e stars in the unsaturated regime , the gradients are very steep , steeper even than what we found for our dm2 and dm3 stellar samples .",

    "this confirms that the slope of the linear lsfs increases in absolute value when the spectral type increases from dk4 to dm4 .",

    "12 we observe a flattening (  saturation \" ) for the fastest rotating dm4e stars for @xmath123  days .",
    "this is a range in periods where saturation is expected to occur ( see sect .",

    ", we observe 12 fast rotators with a mean surface flux of @xmath125 .",
    "we also performed separate linear lsfs to the sub - samples of only the low activity dm4 and the sub - set of high activity dm4e stars ( all of which we assume are in the unsaturated regime ) respectively ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the heteroscedastic linear lsf to the dm4 low activity stars yields :    @xmath126    therefore , the gradient of the rac for the low activity stars is again much shallower than that of the combined sample of low and high activity stars ( unsaturated ) , and by more than @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , the linear lsf to the full sample is somehow inadequate .",
    "we note also that the slopes of the heteroscedastic linear lsf to the sub - samples of only the low activity stars remain approximately constant ( within measurement errors ) from dk4 to dm4 .",
    "this point will be further developed in sect .",
    "the homoscedastic linear lsf to the dm4 low activity stars yields :    @xmath127    again , the gradient of the rac for the low activity stars is shallower than that of the combined sample of low and high activity stars , and by more than @xmath109 .",
    "we find that for the low activity dm4 stars , both the homoscedastic and heteroscedastic models give similar results for the mean value of the slope of the rac .",
    "and this mean value ( 0.825 - 0.91 ) is remarkably similar ( within 1@xmath111 ) to the mean values for low - activity stars in the other 4 spectral sub - types : 0.624 , 0.637 , 0.891 , 0.93 .",
    "however , there is one aspect in which the dm4 slow rotators differ from the other four sub - types : the dm4 stars have significantly larger values of @xmath111 associated with the slope of the rac in both the homo- and hetero - scedastic lsfs .",
    "we will return to this topic in section 3.7.2 below .",
    "we find that the @xmath63 is much poorer for the heteroscedastic model ( 1.966 ) than that for the homoscedastic lsf ( 0.057 )",
    ". nevertheless , both fits are statistically highly significant ( better than 96% ) .",
    "the heteroscedastic linear lsf to the 23 unsaturated dm4e high activity stars yields :    @xmath128    therefore , the gradient of the rac for the high activity stars is also much shallower than that of the combined sample of low and high activity stars , and by more than @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , the linear lsf to the full sample seems rather inadequate .",
    "this point is straightforward if one looks at the linear heteroscedastic lsfs in fig .",
    "it is obvious that the lsfs to the low activity stars , and to the high activity stars can not be reproduced by a simple linear or quadratic function .",
    "we note that the dm4e data confirm the decrease in the slope of the lsf fits to unsaturated stars as we pass through the ttcc .",
    "in addition , we also performed a linear lsf to the full sample of dm4e stars ( unsaturated+saturated ) in order to compare with the previous fit .",
    "we find a slope of -0.47 for the full sub - sample of dm4e stars ( table  1 ) .",
    "this result again suggests that the slopes for the sub - samples of low activity stars and of high activity stars are of the same order after the ttcc .",
    "the parameter @xmath75 is 18.90 for the high activity star sub - sample and 19.13 for the low activity star sub - sample .",
    "these figures are still very high , although that of the low activity sub - sample has decreased compares to other spectral types .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath129 is still much smaller than the period domains of the racs in both cases . as a consequence",
    ", these lsfs should be established with a good confidence level , which is in agreement with the high statistical significances we obtain for these fits ( table  1 ) .",
    "we find that the linear fits ( to the unsaturated dm4+dm4e samples ) are incapable of reproducing the slopes among the low activity stars and the ( unsaturated ) high activity stars .",
    "we face the same problem as we did in dealing with the case of dm3 stars : the problem is that there exists high activity - relatively slow rotators and low activity - relatively fast rotators .",
    "these two types of stars overlap in their range of values of @xmath0 .",
    "the dm3 and especially the dm4 datasets lead us to question the validity of fitting both the low activity and high activity ( unsaturated ) sub - samples with a single rac .",
    "instead , it seems to us that it might be better to consider the possibility that two distinct racs are present in the data . to the extent that the racs are determined with dynamo operation ,",
    "this leads us to wonder : is there perhaps a distinct dynamo process operating in low - activity dm4 stars from the dynamo process which is at work in ( unsaturated ) high - activity dm4e stars ? the slopes of the linear lsf to the low activity stars for our 5 stellar samples are rather homogeneous , even for the dm4 stars , although the latter stars are almost certainly fully convective .",
    "this result suggests that there may exist a single dynamo regime for the slow rotators from dk4 to dm4 within errors ( see sect .",
    "this important result should be tested with larger samples of low activity stars .",
    "there exist more and more unsaturated high activity - relatively slow rotators when we move to the spectral sub - types dm3 and especially dm4 .",
    "these relatively slow rotators overlap in @xmath0 with the low activity stars .",
    "this poses an important problem : we can not fit satisfactorily both the low activity and ( unsaturated ) high activity samples with a single rac .",
    "we suggest that the dynamo mechanisms behave differently among the high activity stars when crossing the ttcc . at the ttcc ( dm3 ) and beyond",
    ", the data suggest that there exist two different dynamo regimes for and high activity stars ( see sect .",
    "these differences in these dynamo regimes could be related to differential rotation : in the young high activity stars differential rotation is expected to be larger , and it should vanish with age , i.e. in the low activity stars . large differential rotation would boost the magnetic field generation in these fully convective stars , such that we could have high activity - relatively slow rotators with large differential rotation .    now that we have assembled enough data to construct racs at five different spectral sub - types for late k and m dwarfs , it is worthwhile to examine the systematics of racs as a function of spectral sub - type .",
    "now that we have values of the rac slopes for five different spectral sub - types , we provide an overview by plotting the slopes as a function of the infra - red color index ( r - i)@xmath47 in fig .  13 . in this figure ,",
    "results are plotted separately for three distinct samples of stars : the low - activity stars only ( lower curves ) , the ( unsaturated ) high activity stars only ( labelled  high activity \" ) , and the combined samples low+high activity stars ( labelled  low+high activity \" ) . in this figure ,",
    "the heteroscedastic models are plotted as solid lines , and the homoscedastic models are plotted as the dashed lines .      in fig .",
    "13 , the upper curves refer to the combined samples : the plotted points indicate the mean values of the rac gradients which we have obtained for each of our 5 sub - samples by means of linear heteroscedastic ( solid line ) and homoscedastic ( dashed line ) lsfs . attached to each mean value of the gradient",
    "is plotted the 1@xmath111 uncertainty in the mean value of the gradient .",
    "we see that the value of the mean gradient becomes monotonically steeper as ( r - i)@xmath47 increases .",
    "the heteroscedastic ( solid line ) and homoscedastic ( dashed line ) models give similar results .",
    "there are some significant differences ( above the @xmath109 level ) between the two models for the dk6 sample , but this does not affect the overall trend observed for the gradient .    the fact that the magnitude of the gradient increases monotonically with increasing spectral type implies that the magnitude of the effects of rotation on the mechanisms of the dynamo increases systematically as we examine our combined samples at later spectral types . if this result is connected with the physics of the dynamo , and if it is physically permissible to consider low activity stars in the same context as ( unsaturated ) high activity stars , then the results in fig .",
    "13 may provide an important new constraint on the dynamo mechanism(s ) .",
    "the magnitude of the gradient increases monotonically as we go from the spectral sub - type dk4 to the spectral sub - type dm4 .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "13 suggest that , if the ttcc occurs at dm3 , the effects of rotation on chromospheric emission are larger in fully convective stars than in early m type and late k dwarfs where a radiative core persists .",
    "if this result is taken at face value , it does not appear to be consistent with the suggestions of durney et al ( 1993 ) , mentioned in the first paragraph of the introduction .",
    "previous studies have also reported a variation in the rac gradient of linear fits ( e.g. stepie 1989 , 1993 , 1994 ) as a function of spectral type : the rac was found to be steepest ( i.e. most negative ) at df6 ( b - v=0.45 ) and shallowest close to dk6 ( b - v=1.41 : kh ) .",
    "however , the most complete study ( stepien 1989 ) did not include any stars which are cooler than dk6 .",
    "thus , the study we report here is complementary to stepie s work , extending that work towards cooler stars as far as dm4 ( ( b - v)=1.60 ) .",
    "however , our results indicate that the trend noted by stepie between df6 and dk6 ( namely , the rac becomes shallower in cool stars ) does _ not _ continue at later spectral types . on the contrary , we find that the trend in the gradient reverses : according to our samples , the rac for the combined samples becomes _ steeper _ as we go towards dm4 .",
    "it is natural to wonder if the pronounced steepening of the rac gradient is a signature of changes in the dynamo mechanism when crossing the ttcc ?",
    "as noted in the introduction above , it appears that the ttcc lies between subtypes dm2 and dm4 . in this context",
    ", we consider it significant that , among the stars in our samples , the rac gradient for the combined samples steepens rapidly between spectral subtypes dm2 and dm4 .",
    "moreover , hm report a notable lengthening in the mean rotation periods of inactive and active stars also at spectral subtype m3 . also at m3 , coronal loops in active stars become noticeably longer ( see hm for a discussion of loop length data reported by mullan et al . [ 2006 ] ) .",
    "our data lead us to believe that something interesting takes place in the spectral subtype range dm2-dm4 as regards the rotational and activity parameters .",
    "is the interesting behaviour between dm2 and dm4 perhaps associated with changes in the dynamo regime when crossing the ttcc ?",
    "possibly , although we have not yet been successful in identifying a physical explanation which accounts for the results reported above .",
    "however , whatever the physical mechanism which is responsible for the increased steepnesses in fig .",
    "13 , the rise in the steepness of the gradient for the combined sample from sub - type k4 to sub - type m2 indicates that the changes occurring in the rac slopes ( and therefore perhaps also in the dynamo mechanism(s ) ) may be progressive and may begin even earlier than sub - type dm2 .",
    "now let us consider only the _ low activity stars _",
    ", in order to position ourselves as much as possible in the unsaturated regime of the ca ii fluxes , and therefore ( hopefully ) also in the unsaturated regime of the dynamo",
    ". the continuous line and dashed line in fig .",
    "13 ( lower curves ) are a plot of the slopes of the heteroscedastic and homoscedastic linear lsfs respectively to the racs for the low activity stars sub - samples only .",
    "the parameter @xmath75 lies between 19.13 and 39.68 for these low activity star sub - samples .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath73 which is a normalized estimate of the mean error on the measurements is much smaller than the period domains of the racs in all cases .",
    "hence , these lsfs should be established to a relatively high confidence level , which agrees with the high statistical significances we obtain for these fits ( table  1 ) .    in this regard",
    ", we note that the process of applying a lsf to a data set leads not only to a mean value for the slope : the lsf also yields a standard deviation @xmath111 for the slope .",
    "we consider it worthwhile to note that the values of @xmath111 contain information about the robustness of the slope .",
    "13 shows that the slopes for the slow rotators ( dk , dm only ) do not behave the same as for the combined samples of stars ( dk+dke or dm+dme ) . the gradient",
    " @xmath130 \" for the low activity stars remains almost constant ( within the error bars ) between dk4 and dm4 at a level of @xmath130 = -(0.8 - 0.9 ) .",
    "more specifically , if we consider not merely the _ absolute value _ of @xmath130 , but also the statistical significance of its value _ compared to its own @xmath111 _ , we find the following pattern : in dk4 stars , the magnitude of @xmath130 is 5.6 times its own @xmath111 , in dk6 stars , @xmath130 is 6.1 times its @xmath111 , in dm2 stars , @xmath130 is 7.4 times its @xmath111 , and in dm3 stars , @xmath130 is 4.3 times its @xmath111 .",
    "all 4 of these cases have slopes which are statistically highly significant .",
    "the chromospheric emission in these cases does indeed depend sensitively on rotation .",
    "but in m4 stars , @xmath130 has a value which is only 2.3 times its own @xmath111 for the homoscedastic model and 2.4 times its own @xmath111 for the heteroscedastic model . in this case , at the 3@xmath111 level of significance , the mean slope which we have derived for the rac of our sample of low activity dm4 stars is formally consistent with zero . in a situation where the slope of the rac is zero ( or formally consistent with zero),the meaning is that the chromospheric emission in low - activity dm4 stars does _ not _ depend on rotation at all ( or is consistent with zero sensitivity to rotation ) .",
    "although our lsfs of the slow rotators seem well established because of the large number of measures we have in our sub - samples , we still consider these results as preliminary and they should be confirmed with measures from a higher resolution spectrograph ( such as eso - espresso ) , because our errors on the individual measures are still large compared to the period domains of the racs .",
    "we also show the slopes of the heteroscedastic and homoscedastic lsfs to the sub - samples of only the ( unsaturated ) high activity stars in fig .  13 .",
    "the parameter @xmath75 lies between 17.20 to 23.45 for these high activity star sub - samples ( the case of dk4e stars is not considered because we have too few measures ) .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath73 which is the normalized estimate of the mean error on the measurements is much smaller than the period domains of the racs in all cases .",
    "hence , these lsfs should be established with a rather good conficence level , which agrees with the high statistical significances we obtain for these correlations ( @xmath13190% , table  1 ) .",
    "however , we consider these results as still preliminary because the domains of the racs are relatively small compared to the typical uncertainties on individual measures .",
    "we note that these slopes behave quite differently from the slopes of the low activity stars and the slopes of the combined samples of low+high activity stars . for the high activity stars , we observe that the slopes are clearly steeper than those for the low activity stars at spectral types dk6 and dm2 . at these spectral types ,",
    "they are also steeper than the slopes of the combined samples of low+high activity stars .",
    "these higher slopes suggest the existence of two different dynamo regimes for the low and the high activity sub - samples for these stars .",
    "however , things change at the ttcc . at the ttcc ( dm3 ) ,",
    "the slopes for the high activity stars are found to diminish dramatically , by a factor of about 2 . although there remains a large uncertainty on this slope for dm3e stars ,",
    "the fall of the slopes at the ttcc is confirmed by the measure of the slope for dm4e stars with a much higher confidence level . beyond the ttcc ( dm4 )",
    ", the slope continues to diminish .",
    "in fact , the slope at dm4 reaches a value that is very similar to the slope we have obtained for the low activity star sub - samples ( although we emphasize that the overall shapes of the racs are very different : see figs .  8 and 12 ) .",
    "this dramatic decrease in steepness among ( unsaturated ) high activity stars at m3 and m4 suggests that the dynamo mechanisms operating in dk4 , dk6 and dm2 high activity stars ( perhaps an @xmath113 dynamo ? ) may be different from those operating in the fully convective dm3 and dm4 high activity stars ( perhaps an @xmath24 dynamo ? ) . in this regard ,",
    "we detect no major changes in the slopes at the ttcc for the low activity star sub - samples apart from a decreased statistical significance of the rac slope .",
    "this point is further discussed in the next sub - section .",
    "we emphasize that , although our lsfs to the high activity stars seem relatively well established , in our sub - samples we have only few measures ( from 8 to 23 ) .",
    "therefore , these results should be confirmed with larger stellar samples and are still preliminary .",
    "these results lead us to suggest a five - part conclusion .",
    "\\(i ) the gradients of the racs which we have obtained in our combined samples of low+high activity stars unambiguously increase with increasing spectral type with a high level of confidence .",
    "but it also appears that the linear lsfs only provide a poor description of the full racs .",
    "\\(ii ) there appears to be a significant dichotomy between the low activity and the ( unsaturated ) high activity sub - samples .",
    "this leads us to consider that there may exist two distinct dynamo regimes in dke , dme and dk , dm stars .",
    "\\(iii ) the gradients of the combined samples suggest that there are changes operating in the dynamo mechanisms before , at , and after the ttcc .",
    "in addition , the gradients to the high activity sub - samples point to important changes in the dynamo mechanisms occuring at the ttcc and beyond .",
    "\\(iv ) we can confidently assert that in low activity dk4 , dk6 , dm2 , and dm3 stars , there is a robust ( @xmath132 ) increase in caii flux as the period decreases .",
    "that is , the dynamo in unsaturated dk4-dm3 stars _ is _ clearly sensitive to rotation .",
    "\\(v ) but in low activity m4 stars , the sensitivity of the dynamo to rotation , although still perhaps present , is not as robust , and may even be zero ( at the 3@xmath111 level of significance ) .",
    "thus , even in the low activity stars in our samples , a rotational dynamo is certainly contributing significantly to chromospheric heating in dk4-dm3 stars .",
    "but in dm4 low activity stars , the signs of rotational control over chromospheric emission are less significant ( in a statistical sense )",
    ".    these two last points , if they can be confirmed , might be relevant in the context of durney et al ( 1993 ) , who suggested that rotation would be a controlling influence in the case of interface dynamos , but should not be as effective as a controlling influence in distributed dynamos .",
    "on the one hand , the robust sensitivity to rotation which we have found in dk4-dm3 low activity stars could be evidence for interface dynamos in those stars .",
    "on the other hand , in dm4 low activity stars , the weaker evidence for statistically significant rotational sensitivity might presage the lessening of the effects of an interface dynamo . in this context , m3 might be considered to be the latest spectral sub - type to have definitive evidence for the presence of a radiative core ( so that an interface dynamo is even possible ) .",
    "it is worth recalling that hm also concluded that at m3 , something unusual happens to the rotational braking .",
    "could the hm result , in combination with our results for the rac slope , be a sign that the ttcc occurs between m3 and m4 ?",
    "this will be tested in a future study using an even finer grained spectral type sampling at about the ttcc using new data .",
    "we suggest that in fig .  13 , the striking difference between the combined sample ( upwardly rising lines ) and the low activity stars only ( lower lines ) may be associated with the fact that the combined sample might contain two distinct regimes of dynamo operation ( high and low ) , whereas the low activity sample contains only a single regime ( low ) .",
    "suppose that the separation of dm4e stars from dm4 stars in fig .",
    "12 is associated with two distinct dynamo regimes : if so , the attempt to fit a lsf to the combined sample of dm4+dm4e stars may involve an attempt to  force \" two different types of dynamos into a single mold . such an attempt would not be as physically meaningful as attempting to fit a truly homogeneous population ( e.g. the low activity stars alone ) .",
    "analogous arguments can be made for dm3 stars ( fig .",
    "8) and dm2 stars ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "according to this argument , it may be more profitable to focus separately on the different curves of the low activity stars and the high activity stars respectively in fig .  13 in order to gain insight into dynamo theory .",
    "we conclude that for the low activity stars only , the gradient is definitely shallower than that for the samples of the low plus high activity stars .",
    "but we also conclude that the gradient for the low activity stars only does not vary significantly with spectral type .",
    "we also note that the differences between the slopes for the low activity stars and for the low+high activity stars increase drastically with increasing spectral type .",
    "this result emphasizes that _ the efficiency of the dynamo mechanisms increases drastically at short rotation periods , and also increases with decreasing stellar mass_. we also conclude that _ there are no significant changes occurring in the efficiency of the dynamo mechanisms for low activity stars as a function of stellar mass when moving from dk4 to dm4_.      in the plots which we have compiled of each rac for our five spectral sub - types ( figs .  2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 12 ) , we overplot the separate heteroscedastic linear lsf to the low activity stars and to the high activity stars for direct comparison with the heteroscedastic linear lsf to the low+high activity samples . as we saw in the previous sections ,",
    "the overplots show clearly that the linear lsf to the low+high activity stars fails completely to reproduce the slopes of the linear lsf which we have derived both from the slow rotators and the fast ( unsaturated ) rotators .",
    "we show that the low+high activity samples can not be described by a single rac .    in view of this",
    ", it seems to us that , to the extent that the rac is determined by a dynamo mechanism , we need to invoke two different dynamo regimes . the first ( we suggest ) is at work among dk and dm stars ( i.e. low - activity stars ) .",
    "this first regime seems rather constant from dk4 to dm4 and is therefore independent ( to a first approximation ) of the spectral type .",
    "a second dynamo regime ( we suggest ) is at work among dke and dme stars .",
    "this second regime exhibits steeper rac slopes for the spectral types dk4 , dk6 and dm2 , and shallower slopes for the dm3 and dm4 spectral types .",
    "the data suggest that the second regime deviates significantly from the first regime at the ttcc and beyond .",
    "the main problem is that , among the stars in our samples at spectral sub - types dm3 and dm4 , there are interlopers , namely , a certain number of high activity - relatively slow rotators and a certain number of low activity relatively - fast rotators that overlap in @xmath0 .",
    "these interlopers make it impossible to reproduce the entire datasets with a single rac .",
    "our results suggest that , whether we are considering low activity stars alone , or the combined samples of low+high activity , the properties of the racs undergo changes of some kind , especially at the ttcc and beyond .",
    "this conclusion is especially true for dm4 stars .",
    "the findings we present here can be considered as providing evidence in favor of the following hypothesis : the dynamo mechanism in fully convective stars is different from the dynamo mechanisms in stars where a tachocline exists .",
    "we propose that differential rotation ( probably important in the young dme stars and less important in the older dm stars ) plays an important role in defining the racs among dm and dme stars at the ttcc and beyond .",
    "we bring together the heteroscedastic linear fits to the low+high activity racs ( in terms of surface fluxes ) for our five spectral sub - types in fig .",
    "14 ( upper panel ) . in this section",
    "we discuss two key aspects of the figure , and how they vary as a function of spectral type : ( i ) the absolute magnitudes of the caii flux , and ( ii ) the slopes of the rac in the unsaturated regime .",
    "there are several striking trends in this figure .",
    "first , with increasing spectral type , the curves tend to shift downward and to the right , i.e. the overall level of chromospheric flux decreases , and the periods tend to be shorter .",
    "important differences between the racs of dk4 , dm2 and dm4 stars have already been reported by houdebine ( 2012b ) . also , variations in the rac properties at different spectral types was previously reported by stepie ( 1993 , 1994 ) .",
    "he found that the @xmath133 relationships globally shifted towards shorter rotation periods as ( b - v ) increases from 0.52 ( df7.5 ) to 1.15 ( i.e. spectral type dk5 , according to kh ) . on the other hand ,",
    "in an earlier study , the opposite tendency emerged : stepie ( 1989 ) found that the @xmath134 relationships were globally shifted towards longer rotation periods for ( b - v ) from 0.45 ( df6 ) to 0.66 ( dg5 ) and that they stabilize for ( b - v ) from 0.75 ( dg8.5 ) to 1.40 ( dk6 ) .",
    "also , patten & simon ( 1996 ) proposed that the projected rotation period becomes longer as one move from spectral types g1 to m2 . in view of this complicated behaviour",
    ", it seems that in the @xmath135 racs , first the rotation period becomes longer between df6 and dg7 , then remains unchanged between dg7 and dk6 , and then the period starts to become shorter between dk6 and dm4 : the latter behaviour persists into later spectral types .    in fig .",
    "14 , in the context of the combined samples ( upper panel ) , one can see that the steepness of the racs ( at least in the unsaturated regime ) increases noticeably as we go towards later spectral type ( as already shown in fig .",
    "we have not detected any saturation behavior for stars in our dk4 , dk6 or dm2 stars , whereas we may observe a saturation in dm3 and dm4 stars for the most rapid rotators .",
    "might this saturated - unsaturated behavior also point towards a different dynamo mechanism in dm3 and dm4 stars from the dynamo mechanism in dk4 , dk6 , and dm2 stars ?",
    "we also observe that the largest caii surface fluxes are found in the stars with the earliest spectral types ( dk4 , dk6 , dm2 ) . for dm4 stars",
    ", there is a pronounced decrease in the absolute magnitudes of the surface fluxes for the fastest ( unsaturated ) rotators compared to dm2 stars .",
    "but even among relatively slow rotators ( with periods longer than 10 days ) , where any effects of saturation are expected to be minimal , the caii surface fluxes are observed to decline by more than 100 between dk4 and dm4 .",
    "surveying the results , we see that dk4 and dk6 stars have similar racs , with a slightly larger gradient for the dk6 stars .",
    "then the rac falls to lower surface fluxes for dm2 stars and the rac steepens .",
    "the rac for dm3 stars is distinctly different in shape compared to that of the dm2 stars : dm3e stars exhibit saturation whereas the dm2e stars do not .",
    "also , dm3 stars overlap in rotation periods with dm2 stars .",
    "this is due to the fact that we found ( in hm ) that dm3 stars possess abnormally long rotation periods for both high activity and low activity stars compared to the adjoining dm2 and dm4 stars . in hm , it was suggested that the anomaly of relatively long rotational periods at type m3 might be related to an empirical report ( mullan et al .",
    "2006 ) that flaring loop lengths undergo an increase to larger values at dm3 . in dm4 stars , the ( unsaturated ) rac shape parallels that of dm3 .    the trends in surface fluxes of caii in fig",
    "14 suggest that whatever is controlling chromospheric emission in our sample stars , the mechanism is less effective ( by factors of 10 or more ) , and leads to different rac shapes , in dm3 and dm4 stars than in dm2 , dk6 , dk4 stars .",
    "now , as regards the latter stars , it might at first sight be believed that we should be fairly confident that interface dynamos are at work ( e.g. mullan et al . 2015 ) .",
    "( unfortunately , we can not be absolutely confident that _ only _ an i d is at work in the dm2 , dk6 , and dk4 stars : the results of brown et al .",
    "( 2010 ) indicate that also a dd can operate in the convection zone of partially convective stars . if both i d and dd are in fact simultaneously operative in a certain star , current dynamo models give no quantitative results for the relative strengths of magnetic fields which would be generated by the different dynamos .",
    "thus , although we use the words  fairly confident \" in the present context , the question of the relative importance of i d and dd in a partially convective star remains ambiguous .",
    "could it be that the different rac shapes in dm3 and dm4 stars might be due to the absence of an interface dynamo ?",
    "if so , ttcc may be occurring between dm2 and dm3 sub - types .",
    "we also note that the changes in the racs are progressive from dk4 to dm4 , and that the fall in the fluxes begins at about dm2 and continues from dm3 to dm4 . however ,",
    "whatever the correct physical interpretation in terms of different dynamos eventually turns out to be , our data show that _ the efficiency of the dynamo mechanisms falls progressively from dk6 to dm4 , and that this fall is particularly pronounced after the ttcc at spectral sub - type m4_.      in the lower panel of fig .",
    "14 , we show results of the heteroscedastic models for low activity stars only .",
    "the most striking difference between the lower and upper panels in fig .",
    "14 is that the low activity stars do not exhibit any evidence for saturated behavior .",
    "moreover , a striking characteristic of the lower panel is that the five racs are almost all parallel to one another ( as already noted in fig .",
    "these features support our claim that low activity stars may provide us with a possible  window \" into a more homogeneous sample in terms of the dynamo mechanism : it seems likely that only unsaturated dynamo operation is at work in the lower panel of fig .",
    "we note that surface fluxes for unsaturated dm4 stars are again found to be 10 - 100 times smaller than those in unsaturated dk4 and dk6 stars .",
    "and we also observe a similar global pattern in both panels ( upper and lower ) : there is a trend towards shorter periods with increasing spectral type .",
    "it is clear that the overall level of caii flux is diminishing as we go from k4 to m4 : the @xmath136 coefficient of the linear lsf to the rac of dk4 stars is larger by a factor of 25 than the linear lsf to the rac of dm4 stars .",
    "this suggests that the dm4 stars at any given period are generating mechanical energy flux some 25 times less effectively than dk4 stars with the same rotational period . even in the much narrower gap between dm3 and dm4 ,",
    "the @xmath136 value for the linear lsf to the rac has decreased by a factor of almost 10 at any particular rotational period .",
    "these results indicate that dm4 stars really are suffering from a weakening of the ability to generate mechanical energy ( whether in magnetic form or in acoustic form or in a combination of both forms ) compared to dm3 and earlier sub - types .",
    "we conclude that the overall level of dynamo efficiency ( as regards chromospheric heating ) diminishes markedly as the stellar mass decreases .",
    "however , we also find that , as regards the low activity stars ( i.e. unsaturated dynamos ) , _ there is an almost universal dependency of the dynamo efficiency on the rotation period : i.e. the level of activity varies approximately as @xmath137 .",
    "_ this universal feature is missing when we attempt to analyze samples which combine stars of _ both _ low activity and high activity .",
    "for the combined samples , our results indicate that the dynamo efficiency decreases differentially and drastically with decreasing rotation period as we move from dk4 dwarfs to m4 dwarfs .      in the spirit of searching for rac s among a variety of parameters ( in case",
    "the correlations are obscured more in certain cases ) , we now set aside the rotation period which we have used so far , and explore how activity depends on rossby number .",
    "dynamo theory suggests that the dynamo efficiency , and therefore the magnetic field strength and its direct diagnostic in the chromosphere , the caii lines , should scale with the dynamo number ( montesinos et al .",

    "an interface dynamo is probably still operating ( mullan et al .",

    "the most striking conclusion of the present section is that , as regards chromospheric heating there are almost two orders of magnitude _ decrease _ in going from dk4 to dm4 .",

    "they found that @xmath44 increased faster than @xmath53 : @xmath181 . in the present study",
    ", we compiled @xmath53 and @xmath179 for our five different spectral subtypes .",
    "we find that the lsf to our samples give :    @xmath182    for our dk4 stars ,    @xmath183    for our dk6 stars ,    @xmath184    for our dm2 stars ,    @xmath185    for our dm3 stars , and    @xmath186    for our dm4 stars .",
    "the correlations are in all cases highly significant ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the only exception occurs in the dk6 stars : this is because in this sample we have only few high activity stars .",
    "since the slope for dk6 stars is the same as for dk4 and dm2 stars , we believe the dk6 correlation is relevant for comparison to other sample correlations .",
    "perhaps the smaller range of @xmath44 values among dk6 stars also contributes to low significance .",
    "we show in fig .",

    "this is essentially identical to the value reported by schrijver et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for f5-k3 stars .",
    "therefore , the same slope seems to prevail for all main - sequence stars from f5 to m4 .",
    "this result emphasizes that in low mass stars , it is a general result that _ the coronal emission grows faster than the chromospheric emission , from low activity stars to high activity stars_. it is interesting to note that when investigating iue spectra of f to k type stars , ayres et al .",
    "( 1981 ) found also a power - law slope of about 1.5 between the @xmath188  k line fluxes and the mgii line fluxes .",
    "however , in their correlation between the soft x - rays and mgii fluxes , they found a larger slope .",
    "however , what is more striking than the similarity in _ gradients",
    "_ found for these correlations , is the _ multiplicative _ coefficients in the correlations .",
    "we find that this factor changes from @xmath189 for dk4 stars to @xmath190 for dm4 stars .",
    "this large difference indicates that the empirical correlations differ greatly from one spectral sub - type to another even if the gradients are comparable . to illustrate this",
    ", we plot the lsf of @xmath179 versus @xmath53 in fig .  18 for our five spectral sub - types .",
    "in all cases , it is apparent that the correlations have slopes which do not differ greatly .",
    "but the absolute values of fluxes from the chromospheres differ greatly .",
    "e.g. , dk4 and dk6 stars have @xmath53 values mainly in the range @xmath191 , whereas the chromospheres of dm4 stars emit mainly in a much lower range , @xmath192 . on the other hand , emissions from the _ coronae _ of dk4 and dm4 stars overlap in the range @xmath193 .    as a result , _ at any given chromospheric emission level , the coronal emission strongly increases as we consider later spectral sub - types_. e.g. , for a chromospheric caii luminosity of @xmath194 , the x - ray luminosity increases by a factor of at least 110 between dk4 and dm4 .",
    "therefore , in the case of m dwarfs , the situation is quite different from that of earlier f , g and k spectral types ( e.g. schrijver et al .",
    "1992 ) : stars from f to g to k all follow a common correlation between @xmath44 and @xmath53 . in a similar vein , the large differences we observe among m dwarfs explains the large scatter observed in the @xmath195 correlation reported by panagi & mathioudakis ( 1993 ) for k and m dwarfs .    it is natural to inquire at this point : what makes m dwarfs so different from f - g - k dwarfs as regards the ratio of coronal to chromospheric emission ?",
    "one possibility has been suggested by mullan ( 1984 ) .",
    "coronal heating depends ultimately on tapping into the reservoir of mechanical energy associated with convective motions . in the context of electrodynamic coupling , the efficiency with which energy contained in that reservoir",
    "can be conveyed to the corona depends on two time - scales , @xmath196 for convection , and @xmath197 for the coronal loops in which the energy is to be deposited . in the sun ,",
    "these time scales differ by factors of order 100 .",
    "this large difference explains why the coronal energy flux from the sun amounts to only 1% or less of the mechanical energy flux in convection .",
    "but mullan ( 1984 ) predicted that as one goes down the main sequence , there could come a point where the two time scales @xmath196 and @xmath197 could be comparable",
    ". this would occur by reduction in @xmath196 due to smaller convection cells , and increases in @xmath197 due to longer coronal loops . by making some assumptions ,",
    "the prediction was made that @xmath196 @xmath198 @xmath197 would occur among stars with @xmath29 @xmath198  3400  k ( see mullan 1984 : section vi ) .",
    "what spectral type does this correspond to ? according to rajpurohit et al ( 2013 ) , the corresponding i - j colour is 1.2 - 1.3 , and the spectral type is m3 .",
    "moreover , i - j = 1.2 corresponds to v - i colour = 2.2 , which is also the colour at which coronal loops become longer ( mullan et al 2006 ) .    at the spectral type",
    "where @xmath196 @xmath198 @xmath197 , the coronal loops would reach a resonance in their efficiency to tap into the convective reservoir . as a result",
    ", the efficiency of coronal heating in dm3 stars would be larger than in the sun by 80 - 170 .",
    "this range overlaps with the excess by factors of order 110 reported in fig .  18 above .",
    "because a resonant process is at work in this model , the increase in coronal heating efficiency is expected to build up in spectral types as these approach closer to the resonance , i.e. approaching m3 .",
    "thus , the full increase by factors of 80 - 170 should be realized at m3 , but smaller enhancements are expected at ( say ) m2 , k6 , and k4 .",
    "it is important to note that the electrodynamic resonance works only for the _ corona _ : there is no analogous process occurring in the _",
    "chromosphere_. heating of the chromosphere , whether in an f star of an m star , continues to rely on localized dissipation of acoustic waves ( for the  basal \" component : mullan and cheng 1993 ) and on localized dissipation of currents , via the conductivity tensor , in a partially ionized medium ( for the  magnetic \" contribution ) ( e.g. kazeminezhad and goodman 2006 ) .",
    "even if the resonant model ( mullan 1984 ) turns out to be incorrect , at least the empirical results explain the @xmath168-@xmath42 relationships reported above .",
    "we can now interpret the @xmath168-@xmath42 relationships ( in fig .",
    "16 ) vis - a - vis the @xmath45-@xmath42 relationships ( in fig .",
    "15 ) . indeed , in late - k and m dwarfs , the 110-fold increase in x - ray coronal emission from spectral sub - types k4 and m4 compensates for the 90-fold decrease in dynamo / chromospheric efficiency from the same spectral types . as a result , in fig .",
    "16 , the m dwarfs have about the same @xmath168 values as the dk4 and dk6 stars , whereas in fig .",
    "15 , we found a drop - off for dm2 stars of about a factor of 10 as regards the chromospheric heating .",
    "note however that in fig .",
    "16 , there is some convergence in @xmath168 for @xmath199 for all spectral types .",
    "this discussion may help us to understand why mullan and macdonald ( 2001 ) failed to identify any signature of the ttcc in @xmath200 data : their failure may result from one aspect of _ coronal _ properties in m dwarfs . as a result of these properties , and their variation with spectral type in the vicinity of an electrodynamic resonance which ( perhaps coincidentally ) overlaps with the ttcc , the _ coronal _",
    "ratio @xmath168 is not really suited for diagnosing the changing properties of the dynamo mechanisms before and at the ttcc . in view of the data presented in the present paper , we are now disposed to believe that the _ chromospheric _ emission ( e.g. the caii luminosity ) is better suited to respond to a signature of the ttcc .",
    "can the properties of the rac s discussed above explain the mean @xmath0 values obtained by hm for stars ranging in spectral sub - type from dk4 to dm4 stars ?",
    "in particular , can they help in understanding the hm results of unexpectedly long rotation periods for dm3 stars ? to answer this , we note that the mean @xmath0 values of the slow rotators tend to decrease towards later spectral types . as a matter of fact , this trend is reproduced in the lower end of the racs ( figs",
    "therefore , the decrease in the mean @xmath0 at later spectral types could be due to the fact that the dynamo mechanisms become inefficient at a rotation period that decreases towards later spectral type ( fig .",
    "14 ) . however , this is not completely the case for the dm3 rac , which extends to somewhat longer periods than the dm2 rac .",
    "globally , the dm3 rac is shifted towards longer periods with respect to the dm2 rac such that the mean @xmath0 for dm3 stars is longer than for dm2 stars ( as mentioned by hm ) . for dm4 stars ,",
    "the whole of the rac is shifted towards shorter rotation periods compared to dm3 stars .",
    "this explains why the mean @xmath0 for dm4 stars is clearly smaller than that for dm3 stars .",
    "in fact , the dynamo mechanism in dm4 stars apparently become so inefficient at long periods that our sample contains not a single dm4 stars with @xmath0 longer than 10 days ( see figs .",
    "this can be contrasted with the much longer @xmath0 values for dm3 stars : as large as 30 days ( see fig .",
    "our discovery in the present paper that the level of chromospheric emission in dm4 stars is definitely smaller than in dm3 stars ( suggesting that dynamo action in dm4 stars is less effective than in dm3 stars ) could explain why the mean @xmath0 is much shorter at dm4 than at dm3 : dm4 stars are not as good at generating magnetic fields , and as a result they do not have access to as good a  magnetic brake \" as dm3 stars . the dm4 stars just keep on spinning fast , whereas the dm3 stars are braked .",
    "this might supplement ( or replace ) the hypothesis of long loop lengths ( cf .",
    "hm ) as the reason for slow rotation at dm3 .    among dm2 stars also",
    ", there are no stars rotating as slowly as the slowest dm3 stars ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "so dm2 stars do not have access to as good a brake as dm3 stars . and",
    "yet , their dynamo effectiveness seems to be as high as , or higher than , the dm3 stars ( see fig .  14 above ) . in this case , the onset of increased loop lengths at dm3 ( cf .",
    "hm ) would help to explain why dm3 stars have access to a better magnetic brake than dm2 stars .",
    "for the fast rotators , we found ( in hm ) that the trend for the mean @xmath0 is to become in general shorter as the spectral type becomes later , except at sub - type dm3 where the mean period is found to be significantly larger .",
    "the minima of the racs show the opposite trend , i.e. the minimum @xmath0 decreases with increasing spectral type . however , only very few active stars are at the extremes of the racs : most active stars lie at longer periods . in the case of dm3 and dm4 stars ,",
    "most active stars lie in the upper part of the rising slope of the rac ( see figs .  8 and 12 ) .",
    "we also refer to figs .  3 and 5 for dk6 and dm2 stars respectively .",
    "therefore , the trend observed in the active stars can be interpreted by the racs only if one considers their locations on these curves .",
    "nevertheless , we note again that the upper end of the rac for dm3 stars ( in its rising part ) is shifted again towards periods which are clearly longer than those for dm2 and dm4 stars .",
    "this again explains at least partly the abnormally large mean @xmath0 of the active dm3 stars ( see hm ) .    in summary , we find that the properties of the racs can explain at least partly the observed trends in the mean @xmath0 and also the abnormally long @xmath0 values reported for dm3 stars by hm",
    ". however , this does not exclude another explanation , possibly involving a change in loop lengths ( hm ) , which might also contribute to the unusual rise in the mean @xmath0 at dm3 .",
    "west & basri ( 2009 ) investigated the rotation and activity in @xmath4 in a sample of 14 late - type m dwarfs ( m6-m7 ) .",
    "they found that many of these objects are rotating relatively fast ( @xmath201 ) but have also @xmath4 in absorption .",
    "these rotational velocities imply rather short rotation periods for these small objects .",

    "but we would like to suggest another possible interpretation , as follows .    in view of our own results for the rac s in m4 , m3 , and m2 stars ,",
    "we find it a matter of interest that the slope of the chromospheric rac determined by w15 for m1-m4 stars ( -0.19@xmath500.036 ) is much shallower than the values we have found . for our combined samples of dm+dme stars , we have found slopes of -1.5 to -2.5 ( see table  2 ) . and",
    "even when we confine attention to the slow rotators , we still find slopes for m2 , m3 , and m4 dwarfs ( -0.89 to -0.93 ) which are clearly significantly steeper than w15 report for their m1-m4 sample .",
    "our results indicate that chromospheric emission in m2-m4 stars in our samples exhibit much stronger sensitivity to rotation than w15 have reported for either of their samples .",
    "is it possible that this dichotomy arises from selection effects ?",
    "we note that the data of w15 include mainly  active \" stars with @xmath4 _ in emission _ i.e. fast rotators , whereas our samples ( especially the slow rotator samples ) are biased towards slow rotators ( @xmath4 _ not _ in emission ) .",
    "now , fast rotators are more likely to be in the saturated regime of the dynamo ( see section 1.1 above ) : in that regime , the rac flattens out , and takes on a slope which is close to zero .",
    "in fact , in a discussion of the systematic differences between their m1-m4 sample and their m5-m8 sample , w15 point out that  at similar rotation periods , a much larger fraction of the late - type m dwarfs [ m5-m8 ] are active \" than is the case for the m1-m4 stars . visual inspection of fig .  6 in w15 suggests that some 65% of their m1-m4 stars are labelled  active \" while almost 90% of their m5-m8 stars are  active \" .",
    "this is consistent with the w15 statement that a  much larger fraction \" of the m5-m8 stars are in the saturated regime .",
    "this leads us to wonder if the presence of saturated behavior is contributing to the ( essentially ) zero slope reported by w15 for m5-m8 stars . and even among the m1-m4 stars of w15 , where the fraction of active stars is admittedly smaller than in the m5-m8 sample , that fraction is by no means small : some 65% of the m1-m4 stars are  active \" , and",
    "therefore may , lie in the saturated regime .",
    "suppose that 65% of the m1-m4 stars in the w15 sample lie in the saturated regime ( with a slope of zero ) , while the remaining 35% lie in the unsaturated regime , where the slope is finite ( and negative ) , with a value of -a .",
    "then the complete w15 sample of m1-m4 stars would have an rac with an average slope a(w15 ) = ( 0.65@xmath2130 ) + ( 0.35@xmath213(-a ) ) . for slow rotators with spectral sub - types extending from dk4 to dm4",
    ", we have found that -a can take on values in the range from -0.6 to -0.9 .",
    "this leads us to predict that a(w15 ) could range from -0.21 to -0.32 .",
    "in fact , the empirical slope reported by w15 ( -0.19@xmath500.036 ) contains , within a 3@xmath111 range , values of a(w15 ) extending from -0.08 to -0.30 .",
    "this overlaps extensively with our predicted range of slopes .",
    "thus , it is possible that : ( i ) the existence of a small but finite negative slope obtained by w15 for m1-m4 stars is due to the presence of a minority ( 35% ) of stars in the unsaturated regime , and , ( ii ) the change in slope in going from m1-m4 to m5-m8 is due to the larger number of stars in the saturated regime among the m5-m8 sample . in order to test these possibilities , and in order to get a more definitive test of a change in dynamo mode at the ttcc",
    ", we suggest that it would be best to concentrate on stars in the unsaturated regime .",
    "so far , our own studies have not yet reached into m5-m8 stars : it will be a matter of great interest to determine if the w15 findings of significant change in rac slope between m4 and m5 can be replicated using unsaturated stars .",
    "in this section , we first ( section 5.1 ) summarize the approach we have adopted in order to study dynamos in low - mass stars .",
    "then we go on ( sections 5.2 - 5.5 ) to describe how we have characterized quantitatively the observational data in terms of chromospheric observations .",
    "a discussion of coronal data follows ( section 5.6 ) . in section 5.7",
    "we present the major conclusions of our study in terms of three hypotheses about dynamo action in low - mass dwarf stars .",

    "dynamos are believed to be operative .",
    "dynamos may rely on rotation plus turbulence , or on turbulence alone , to generate magnetic fields which then , as a result of  magnetic activity \" ( of some kind ) lead to heating of the chromospheric and coronal gas .",
    "it is possible that different types of dynamos are at work in stars of different masses . in this paper",
    ", we bring together observational evidence to see if it is possible to identify signatures of different types of dynamos .",
    "our study is based on the assumption that different types of dynamos are expected to lead to different answers to the following question : how does the amount of  activity \" behave as a function of  rotation \" ? in order to address this , we need to compile data which provide us with quantitative measures of  activity \" and  rotation \" .",
    "an important aspect of the present paper is that we measure rotational speeds in stars which are rotating more slowly than has been reported in previous studies .",
    "why are we interested in slow rotators ?",
    "the reason has to do with the physics of dynamos : theoretical work suggests that rotational dynamo operation can saturate when the rotational speed reaches a certain limit .",
    "it seems to us that it would be difficult to extract information from a saturated dynamo , where the activity level no longer depends on how fast the star is rotating .",
    "for this reason , we prefer in this paper to deal with dynamos in an unsaturated condition , where an increase in rotation leads to a clear and measurable increase in activity .",

    "a general feature of many racs is that as rotational periods become shorter , the caii surface flux becomes larger , up to a point . beyond that point ,",
    "shorter periods do not lead to any increase in caii flux : at these shortest periods , the rac is probably  saturated \" .",
    "a key aspect of the present paper is that we discuss only the unsaturated part of the rac . in this case , we obtain least squares fits of the rac to a function of the form @xmath215 . in a log - log plot , @xmath130 is the slope of the rac , and is a negative number . the coefficient @xmath136 is a measure of the amplitude of chromospheric heating .",
    "numerical values of the slope @xmath130 which we have obtained from least squares fitting to our data for the various spectral sub - types are shown in fig",
    "the different curves show the results we have obtained when we group our target stars in three different ways .",

    "( ii ) the curve which runs ( almost ) horizontally near the lower boundary of the figure refers to stars which are confined to the low activity sub - samples ( dk , dm ) .",
    "( iii ) the  jagged \" curve extending from middle left to lower right refers to stars which are confined to the high activity sub - samples ( dke , dme ) .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "13 will guide our discussion of dynamos in the final sub - section below .      as a second step in obtaining racs ,",
    "we consider not the slopes , but the overall level of chromospheric heating in terms of the ratio of @xmath53 to @xmath52 . based on this ratio ,",
    "we have obtained racs based on a more physically relevant parameter ( the rossby number @xmath216 ) .",
    "these racs ( see fig .",
    "15 ) show that , at the longest rotation periods ( @xmath217 = -1.2 ) in our data set , chromospheric heating in dm3 stars is _ less effective by a factor of about 20 _ than in dk4 stars .",
    "our results suggest that the _ chromospheric _ heating efficiency in dm4 stars is _ less effective _ by a factor of about 100 than in f - g - k type stars . we also observe a progressive decline in the location of the racs as we go from dk4 to dm4",
    ": dk6 stars lie slightly below ( a factor of 3 ) the rac of f , g and k type stars , while dm2 stars lie a factor of 10 below the rac of f , g , and k type stars . the data point to a conclusion which we consider reliable : the efficiency of chromospheric heating decreases progressively between dk4 and dm4 .",
    "the amplitude of the overall decrease is 20 - 90 .",
    "this also implies that the overall efficiency of the dynamo mechanisms also decreases by the same factors when moving from k4 to m4 dwarfs .",
    "turning now to the rac associated with _",
    "emission , we find a very different behavior from the chromospheric data ( fig .",
    "the coronal emission @xmath168 _ does not decrease _ significantly as we go from dk4 to dm4 .",
    "the lack of decrease is especially marked when we compare the coronal emission to the chromospheric emission ( see fig .",
    "18 ) : for a given value of @xmath53 ( say @xmath218 ergs / s ) , the value of @xmath44 in dm4 stars is larger by a factor of order 100 compared to @xmath44 in dk4/dk6 stars .",
    "thus , while the _ chromospheric _ heating efficiency is _ decreasing _ as we go from dk4 to dm4 ( by a factor of up to 100 ) , the _ coronal _ heating efficiency is simultaneously _ increasing _",
    "( by a factor of 100 or so ) .    in terms of a dynamo interpretation , this raises the question : which part of a stellar atmosphere should we study in order to obtain more reliable information about dynamo efficiency in m dwarfs , the chromosphere or the corona ?",
    "the behaviors are so different that it is not clear that the same information about the dynamo will emerge from both data sets .",
    "we have argued ( section 3.11 ) that it may be preferable to concentrate on the chromosphere .    in view of this",
    ", we now present some conclusions which , in our opinion , help to bring order to the chromospheric data which have been analyzed in the present paper",
    ".      inspection of fig .",
    "13 leads us to offer the following hypotheses .",
    "\\(i ) in the case of low - activity stars , we see that the rac slope @xmath130 is essentially unchanged as we go from dk4 to dm4 . to the extent that a particular rac slope is associated with a particular dynamo mechanism ,",
    "our results indicate that low - activity stars have essentially the _ same _ dynamo at work in stars which range in spectral sub - type from dk4 to dm4 .",
    "such a dynamo must have something to do with a physical property which is present in _ all _ low mass stars from dk4 to dm4 , i.e. on both sides of the ttcc .",
    "what property is common to all such stars ?",
    "the answer is : all of them have a deep convective envelope in which turbulence provides a ready supply of energy to drive a distributed dynamo ( dd ) i.e. a dynamo which could be described by either an @xmath21 model or an @xmath24 @xmath15 model .",
    "this leads us to * hypothesis ( a ) * : low - activity stars from dk4 to dm4 may be dominated by a turbulent ( dd ) dynamo .",
    "\\(ii ) in the case of the rac for high - activity stars , the aspect of fig . 13 that is most likely to catch the eye is probably the  jagged \" behavior at early spectral types .",
    "but we would like to draw attention at first to a different aspect of the racs : namely , the values of the slopes @xmath130 at the _ latest _ spectral types ( dm3e and dm4e ) . in these cases ,",
    "our results indicate that the rac slopes for high - activity stars are essentially the _ same _ as for the low - activity stars . once again relying on a putative association between an rac slope and a dynamo mechanism",
    ", these results suggest that at spectral types dm3 and dm4 , the dynamo mechanism in low- _ and _ high - activity stars are actually the _ same_. it has already been suggested ( see ( i ) ) that a dd is at work in all low - activity stars .",
    "this leads us to * hypothesis ( b ) * : in the high activity stars at the latest sub - types in our samples ( dm3e and dm4e ) , a dd is at work .",
    "this is not a surprising conclusion : dm3e and dm4e stars are completely convective ( cc ) , so they also have access to dd operation in the form of either an @xmath21 dynamo model or an @xmath24-@xmath15 dynamo model .",
    "\\(iii ) moving now to high - activity stars at earlier spectral types ( dk4e , dk6e , and dm2e ) , we see in fig .",
    "13 that the rac slopes _ are very different from the slopes of the low - activity stars_. this suggests that high - activity stars in the range dk4e - dm2e have access to a _ different kind of dynamo _ from the type ( dd ) that may dominate in low - activity stars",
    ". what might give rise to a non - dd type of dynamo in stars with spectral types in the range dk4-dm2 ?",
    "the answer is surely related to the fact that such stars have interfaces between the outer convective envelope and an inner radiative core .",
    "this leads to * hypothesis ( c ) * : in high - activity stars at the earliest spectral types in our samples , an interface dynamo ( i d ) is at work .",
    "it seems probable that such a dynamo could be described by an @xmath13-@xmath15 dynamo model . to be sure",
    ", dk4e - dm2e stars also have deep convective envelopes : therefore a dd is probably also at work .",
    "but the clear difference in rac slopes between low - activity stars in the range dk4-dm2 and high - activity stars in the range dk4e - dm2e indicates that the dd ( with its shallow rac slope ) is not playing a dominant role in dk4e - dm2e stars .",
    "\\(iv ) if our hypotheses have any validity , we can conclude that the primary quantitative difference between i d and dd is this : the rac slopes are steeper ( by up to 1.5 units ) among the i d stars than the dd stars .",
    "thus , the i d stars are much more sensitive to rotation than the dd stars .",
    "specifically , if we compare two stars which differ in rotation by a factor of ( say ) 10 , two stars where i d operates will differ in activity level by a factor which is 30 times larger than the difference in activity level of two stars where dd operates .",
    "\\(v ) the conclusion in item ( iv ) is reminiscent of a suggestion that was made by durney et al ( 1993 ) : the rac in a star with i d should depend sensitively on period , but the rac in a star with dd should not . the results in fig",
    ". 13 are at least partially consistent with durney et al . :",
    "i d stars ( as we identify them ) are definitely more sensitive to rotation than dd stars ( as we identify them ) .",
    "admittedly , we have not found that the dd has _ zero _",
    "slope for its rac : but we have found that the slope is at least smaller than in the i d stars .    the fact that the dd stars have an rac with a non - zero slope suggests that rotation @xmath15 does have @xmath219 effect on the activity level in these stars . in terms of the two options which we have proposed in hypotheses a and b above , it might be preferable to conclude that the dominant dynamo model in dd stars may be the @xmath21-@xmath15 model .",
    "finally , we make a point about the overall methodology which has been ultimately responsible for this paper .",
    "the opening sentence in item ( i ) above , which provides a start to our 3 hypotheses , would not have been possible if we did not have access to a large sample of _ low - activity _ stars .",
    "such stars are slow rotators . therefore ,",
    "if the lead author of this study ( erh ) had not paid attention to extracting the lowest possible values of @xmath220 ( of order 1 @xmath221 ) in as many stars as possible , our sample of low - activity stars might have been so small as to prevent us from drawing statistically significant conclusions .      the theoretical concept that main sequence stars undergo",
    "a transition to complete convection ( ttcc ) at a particular mass ( in the vicinity of spectral types m2-m4 ) has been in the literature for 50 years or more .",
    "nevertheless , the search for an empirical signature which might support this concept has yielded no definitive evidence .",
    "for example , mullan and macdonald ( 2001 ) sought such evidence in x - ray data , but were unable to identify any signature of the ttcc .",
    "also in our own coronal data ( fig .  16 ) , we see no definitive sign of a transition .",
    "neither could we find evidence for the ttcc in the racs of chromospheric data when we combined low- and high - activity stars ( fig .",
    "13 , monotonically rising line from lower left to upper right ) .",
    "nor could we find any evidence of ttcc when we confined our attention to the chromospheric racs of low - activity stars ( lowest lying line in fig .",
    "however , in one particular sample , our study has led to what we believe is a potentially valuable signature . specifically , in our sample of high - activity stars between dk4e and dm4e , the slopes of the chromospheric rac ( fig .",
    "13 ,  jagged \" line ) consists of 2 distinct regimes . in one regime",
    ", the slopes overlap with the ( shallow ) slopes of low - activity stars . in the other regime ,",
    "the slopes are found to be much steeper .",
    "we interpret the transition between the two regimes as evidence for a transition between dynamo modes .",
    "the transition occurs between dm2e and dm3e .",
    "we suggest that this cross - over from steep to shallow rac slopes may provide empirical evidence that the ttcc has been crossed .",
    "we have shown how empirical information about rotation and chromospheric emission may contribute to understanding some aspects of dynamo mechanisms in cool dwarfs .",
    "data for m dwarfs with spectral types later than m4 , and also for l and t dwarfs would be of great interest to complete our view on the dynamo mechanisms in low - mass stars .",
    "for example , is there any evidence that the efficiency of coronal heating actually decreases after we pass though the electrodynamic resonance which is expected to occur around dm3-dm4 ?",
    "it would also be of interest to investigate the variations of rotational and chromospheric properties by using finer grained samples of stars near the ttcc , i.e. using samples of stars all of which are confined to spectral types of dm2.5 , dm3.5 , and dm4.5 stars .",
    "this could contribute to better understanding of the behavior of possible changes in the dynamo mechanism(s ) at the ttcc .",
