    "one important statistical tool to access the structure of complex networks arising in many systems  @xcite is the clustering coefficient , introduced by watts and strogatz  @xcite to measure `` the cliquishness of a typical neighborhood '' in the network and given by the average fraction of neighbors which are interconnected with each other . this quantity has been used for instance to characterize small - world networks  @xcite , to understand synchronization in scale - free networks of oscillators  @xcite and to characterize chemical reactions  @xcite and networks of social relationships  @xcite .",
    "one pair of linked neighbors corresponds to a ` triangle ' , i.e.  a cycle of three connections .",
    "while triangles may be abundant in monopartite networks , they can not be formed in bipartite networks  @xcite , where two types of nodes exist and connections link only nodes of different type .",

    "bipartite networks arise naturally in e.g.  social networks  @xcite where the relationships ( connections ) depend on the gender of each person ( node ) , and there are situations , such as in sexual contact networks  @xcite , where one is interested in comparing clustering properties between monopartite and bipartite compositions .    in this paper",
    ", we study the cliquishness of either monopartite and bipartite networks , using both the standard clustering coefficient and an additional coefficient which gives the fraction of squares , i.e.  cycles composed by four connections .",
    "as shown below , such a coefficient retains the fundamental properties usually ascribed to the standard clustering coefficient in regular , small - world and scale - free networks . as a specific application ,",
    "two examples of networks of sexual contacts will be studied and compared , one being monopartite and another bipartite .",
    "furthermore , we will show that one can take triangles and squares as the basic units of larger cycles in any network , monopartite or multipartite .",
    "the frequency and distribution of larger cycles in networks have revealed its importance in recent research for instance to characterize local ordering in complex networks from which one is able to give insight on their hierarchical structure  @xcite , to determine equilibrium properties of specific network models  @xcite , to estimate the ergodicity of scale - free networks  @xcite , to detect phase transitions in the topology of bosonic networks  @xcite and to help characterizing the internet structure  @xcite .",
    "since the computation of all cycles in arbitrarily large networks is unfeasible , one uses approximate numerical algorithms  @xcite or statistical estimations  @xcite . here",
    ", we go a step further and deduce an expression to estimate the number of cycles of larger size , using both clustering coefficients , which not only improves recent estimations  @xcite done for monopartite networks , but at the same time can be applied to bipartite networks and multipartite networks of higher order .",
    "we start in section [ sec : squares ] by introducing the expression which characterizes the cliquishness of bipartite networks , comparing it with the usual clustering coefficient . in section [ sec : sexual ] we apply both coefficients to real networks of sexual contacts and in section [ sec : new ] we use them to estimate cycles of larger size and show how it is applied to bipartite networks .",

    "thus , one should take triangles and squares simultaneously as the two basic cycle units in any network .",
    "an application of both clustering coefficients was proposed , namely to estimate the number of cycles in any network , either monopartite or multipartite .",
    "using a recent estimation which yields a lower bound of the number of cycles in monopartite network up to a size @xmath124 where @xmath113 is the maximum number of neighbors in the network , we deduce a more general expression which not only improves the previous estimation but is also suitable for bipartite networks and enables one to estimate cycles of size up to @xmath92 .",
    "furthermore , in the particular case of bipartite networks our estimation yields as a natural consequence that only cycles of even size may appear .",
    "we also studied a concrete example of two sexual networks , one where only heterosexual contacts occur ( bipartite network ) and another with homosexual contacts ( monopartite ) .",
    "the results obtained with the two real networks were compared with the ones obtained with a scale - free network and with an agent model recently introduced .",
    "our results emphasize that , in general , the agent model seems to be more suitable to reproduce networks of sexual contacts than the standard approach with random scale - free networks .",
    "furthermore , our results for the clustering distribution of both real sexual networks gave some evidence that the clustering ability in sexual networks probably does not depend on the type of sexual contact ( homosexual or heterosexual ) .",
    "to strengthen this hypothesis it is necessary to use larger networks of sexual contacts and apply the topological quantities here described .",
    "these and other questions are being analyzed in more detail and will be presented elsewhere .",
