    "statistical models in two dimensions can often be dealt with by several of the exact methods and have been invaluable sources of ideas in quantum field theory and many - body physics .",
    "however , little is known about two - dimensional models with layered structure , which have been considered in various contexts @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we propose a bi - layered @xmath0 loop model with a particular type of the interlayer coupling which allows the exact calculation of the partition function by a simple path - integral based on the gaussian action .",
    "our main tool is coulomb gas ( cg ) method .",
    "let us recall some general features of cg .",
    "as is well known , fluctuations of a system become important in the lower dimensions and , the critical exponents differ much from those of the gaussian ( or mean - field ) theory . indeed , in two dimensions , we have a zoo of critical models which are quite different from the gaussian ; for instance , they are the unitary minimal models @xcite , which satisfy highly - nontrivial bootstrap conditions under the infinite - dimensional conformal symmetry @xcite .",
    "interestingly , however , it turned out that introducing intrinsic charges in a gaussian theory can give heuristic , nevertheless exact , descriptions of a certain class of critical models @xcite .",
    "such descriptions are generically referred as the coulomb gas and enable us to calculate the scaling dimensions @xcite , @xmath5-point functions @xcite , and partition functions @xcite .",
    "let us turn to more specific lattice models whose continuum limits are described by the cg .",
    "the simplest is the @xmath0 loop model ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "this model actually have considerable importance for general models with the central charge @xmath6 .",
    "for instance , each member of the unitary minimal models can be represented as a superposition of several different loop models .",
    "model which is generalized to have another parameter @xmath7 ( a weight for non - contractible loops ; see section [ section_singlelayer ] ) form a complete basis for those of the a - d - e lattice models ( @xmath8 ) @xcite and therefore for the minimal conformal field theories @xcite .",
    "further , the cg analysis of the loop models also provide us with the results on the non - unitary models such as the percolation , self - avoiding walk ( @xmath9 ) @xcite , and dense polymer ( @xmath10 ) @xcite . ]    in a standard , algebraic view , partition functions of conformal field theories in general are assumed to have the sesquilinear form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the allowed highest weight and @xmath13 is the character of the representation in some algebra ; an integer @xmath14 is the multiplicity of the corresponding representation .",
    "this expression ( [ zchichi ] ) reveals the operator content , from which one can extract various physics in the continuum limit .",
    "the cg method allows us to evaluate the partition function of the @xmath0 loop model on a torus in a remarkably direct way ( without algebraic inputs ) .",
    "it is essentially given by a path - integral over a compact bosonic field governed by the gaussian action @xmath15\\propto",
    "\\int d^2 z~ \\left ( \\nabla \\varphi(z)\\right)^2 , \\label{gaussianaction0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the bosonic field @xmath16 is a continuum version of the height function on the dual lattice which is uniquely determined from the non - intersecting loop configurations on a honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the cg methods is this kind of flexibility in scales compared to the other exact methods ; from microscopic ( lattice ) formulation of a model , we can derive the corresponding macroscopic ( continuum ) behavior , which is yet straightforward to handle analytically .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the @xmath0 loop model to a bi - layer model through the lattice formulation and calculate its continuum partition function on a torus in the form by which one can , in general , read off the operator content .",
    "the model has an interaction determined from the number of intersections between two loops each from each layer .",
    "the decoupling of the local fluctuations from the topological ones , which is essential in the single - layer loop model @xcite , is taken over to this model .",
    "this is actually due to the topological nature of the inter - layer interaction .",
    "as we mentioned , multi - layered models appear in many places . in particular , it is important for the disordered systems @xcite .",
    "it is the essence of the replica method that taking @xmath17 limit gives the physics of disordered system , where @xmath18 is the number of layers .",
    "although it should be noted that our interlayer coupling might differ from that arise from the replica method , we think this as a step towards the understanding of the replica limit .    as the principle of the path - integral dictates",
    ", we should sum over all the topological sectors .",
    "accordingly , we obtain a sum over all the possible pairs of torus knots ; each knot is characterized by two coprime integers and corresponds to a homotopical class of non - contractible loops on the one of the torus - layers . from this expression , we can easily see the modular invariance @xcite of the partition function .    to deal with the sum over the coprime integers ,",
    "we apply the mbius inversion formula @xcite .",
    "our expression for the multiplicity in the bi - layer system involves the product of the ramanujan sums , and looks similar to the one which occurs in the additive number theory .",
    "it contains highly non - trivial selection rules . to illustrate this",
    ", we analyze the partition function of the bi - layered o(1 ) models .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section_model ] , the model is defined on the lattice with doubly - periodic boundary conditions . at a special point of parameters , the model becomes an inhomogeneous vertex model .",
    "we derive , in section [ section_intersection ] , a determinant formula which counts the number of intersections . in section [ section_singlelayer ]",
    ", we review the ideas used in calculating the partition function of the @xmath0 model . in doing so",
    ", we fix the notations of the parameters used in the continuum formulation .",
    "section [ section_bilayer ] contains our main result .",
    "we first show the modular invariance of the partition function .",
    "next , we evaluate it by the repeated applications of the mbius inversion formula",
    ". the poisson ressumation can then be performed , resulting in an expression for conformal dimensions of various operators , which depends continually on the interaction parameter @xmath19 .",
    "section [ section_bilayero1 ] is devoted to a brief inspection of the examples in the bi - layered @xmath2 models .",
    "the lower spectrum seems to be related to that of a particular coset model . in section [ section_flow ] ,",
    "we observe generic properties of the flow of the conformal dimensions when one varies @xmath19 . in section",
    "[ section_conclusion ] , we conclude with few remarks . in [ section_derivation ] , a short derivation of the formula concerning the mbius inversion is given . in [ section_isingorbifold ] , the critical ising parition function and its squares , which we need for checking one of our examples are reviewed from a unified , orbifold point of view .",
    "the @xmath0 model is a spin model generalizing the ising model , whose partition function , on a honeycomb lattice , allows the following loop representation : @xmath20 where the sum is over non - self - intersecting loop configurations ; @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the length of loops and number of loops , respectively . for @xmath23 ,",
    "the model becomes critical at some @xmath24 .",
    "the universality class of the critical @xmath0 model is studied well by mapping the model to a six - vertex model on a kagome lattice with the coulomb gas method @xcite or by mapping it to a seven - vertex model on the same honeycomb lattice , which is solved by the bethe ansatz method @xcite .",
    "a crucial step existing in both methods is to give an orientation to each loop .",
    "namely , one decomposes the real weight @xmath25 in ( [ zon ] ) into two complex weights : @xmath26 and assigns @xmath27 ( resp .",
    "@xmath28 ) to each clockwise ( resp . anti - clockwise ) loop .",
    "the partition function ( [ zon ] ) is then written as @xmath29 where the sum is over the configurations of oriented loops and @xmath30 ( resp .",
    "@xmath31 ) is the number of clockwise ( resp . anti - clockwise ) loops . using the relation @xmath32 , which holds for the loops on the honeycomb lattice on a plane ,",
    "the weight @xmath33 can be further decomposed and redistributed as : @xmath34 at a vertex , resulting in the seven - vertex model @xcite .     formed by the honeycomb lattice of the layer @xmath35 ( solid lines ) and that of the layer @xmath36 ( dotted lines ) .",

    "consider two layers @xmath35 and @xmath36 each of which consists of the honeycomb lattice with doubly - periodic boundary conditions . to obtain an oriented loop configuration , place arrows on some of the edges of @xmath35 and @xmath36 independently such that at each vertex there are either no arrows , or just one arrow in and just one out . now",
    "define a lattice formed by stacking @xmath35 and @xmath36 such that there are two types of the vertices , @xmath40 with three edges and @xmath41 with six edges ; we denote this by @xmath37 ( fig .",
    "[ loopconfig ] ) . then",
    "two oriented loops @xmath42 on @xmath35 and @xmath43 on @xmath36 can intersect each other on @xmath37 at the vertex of type @xmath41 . as an interlayer coupling ,",
    "we assign a weight @xmath44 , @xmath45 for each intersection of loops depending on the orientations .",
    "the sign @xmath46 at an intersection p is defined locally and relatively for two oriented loops @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "namely p is counted as @xmath47 ( resp .",
    "@xmath48 ) if @xmath43 crosses @xmath42 at p from right to left ( resp . from left to right ) .",

    "one easily verifies that @xmath52 if there are only loops each of which is homotopic to a point .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain a coupled model , we have to consider the model on a manifold on which some of the loops can be non - contractible so that we may have @xmath53 ; we here consider the model on a torus .    .",
    "the solid lines and dotted lines ( both with arrows ) represent the loop segments on the layer a and on the layer b , respectively .",
    "these weights are invariant under @xmath54-rotations of each configuration .",
    "note that the weights at the top and bottom in the last column also appear in the set of weights at the vertex of the type @xmath40.,width=377 ]    the partition function of the bi - layer model is then given by @xmath55 where @xmath21 , @xmath30 ( resp .",
    "@xmath31 ) stand for a total length of loops , a number of contractible clockwise ( resp .",
    "anti - clockwise ) loops as before .",
    "since the interlayer coupling is defined locally , the model ( [ zlat ] ) can be thought of as a vertex model on the lattice @xmath37 .",
    "the weight for an oriented - loop configuration on the lattice @xmath37 is given by the product of the local vertex weights ( fig .",
    "[ vertexweights ] ) .",
    "this vertex model is special in its inhomogeneity : the vertex of type @xmath40 allows @xmath56 arrow - configurations and the vertex of type @xmath41 allows @xmath57 configurations",
    ". it would be nice if one could find the exact solution of this and compare that with an analysis based on our continuum partition function .",
    "for an oriented non - contractible loop , we have another relation @xmath58 , which is distinct from the relation for a contractible loop . therefore , under the vertex rule ( [ onvertex ] ) , the non - contractible ( oriented ) loop in ( [ zlat ] ) has the trivial weight @xmath59 .",
    "instead , we can assign a different weight @xmath60 with @xmath61 : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are number of positively and negatively oriented non - contractible loops , respectively .",
    "for definiteness we use a convention in which we call `` positive '' for a loop of the winding numbers @xmath65 with @xmath66 , or with @xmath67 if @xmath68 . in the continuum limit of the single layer model ,",
    "this assignment of the weight is possible by a certain modification of the partition function @xcite , which will be used in section [ section_continuum ] . in view of constructing the partition function basis",
    "( see the first footnote for single - layer ) , it seems to be necessary to include this type of distinct weight @xmath7 in the definition .",
    "here we give a general consideration on the distinction of the physics according to the value of @xmath1 .",
    "consider an arbitrary loop configuration on the layer a , then the weight for adding new non - contractible loop on the layer b will be , depending on the possible orientations , @xmath69 or @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the additional intersection number .",
    "if @xmath72 , we have @xmath73 , and both orientation of the new loop occur in amplitudes with the same modulus . on the other hand , if @xmath74 , this symmetry is violated ; one of the two possible orientation is preferred to the other . in this paper",
    ", we only consider the `` symmetric '' case : @xmath72 .",
    "thus , we set @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "the scale of the parameter @xmath19 is chosen for the later convenience , and the rescaled coupling @xmath77 will be defined in ( [ ghat ] ) .      our purpose in introducing the signs to the intersections is to set the weight induced by the interlayer - coupling independent on a local fluctuation of loops .",
    "this is guaranteed by the invariance of the intersection number @xmath38 under    * \\(i ) an addition of contractible loops ( fig .",
    "[ localdeformations]-(a ) ) , * \\(ii ) a local deformation of loops ( fig .",
    "[ localdeformations]-(b ) ) .    actually , it is these properties that enable us to decompose the bosonic field into local and global part and to do a path integral calculations in section [ section_continuum ] .     is common ( equal to five ) for all the three cases .",
    ", width=415 ]    now let us count the total intersection numbers @xmath38 between loops belonging to the distinct layers .",
    "firstly , one may forget about contractible loops by the invariance under ( i ) .",
    "the result can be stated in terms of the pair of total winding numbers @xmath78 and @xmath79 will become clear when we define the frustration in section [ section_singlelayer ] . ] due to the presence of the several non - contractible loops on each layer .",
    "below , we show the following : @xmath80 since loops on a honeycomb lattice should be non - self - intersecting , only one type of homotopy class is allowed on each layer ( otherwise they intersect within the same layer ) .",
    "this reduces the problem to the calculation of the intersection number between more fundamental objects .",
    "namely , they are the torus knots characterized respectively by the winding numbers @xmath81 and @xmath82 which are coprime @xmath83 where @xmath84 stands for the greatest common divisor ( gcd ) of @xmath85 and @xmath86 ; one should merely multiply @xmath87 to @xmath88 , if the configuration consists of the total winding number with @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "this procedure is compatible with the bi - linearity of the determinant .",
    "thus , we can assume ( [ coprime ] ) without loss of generality .",
    "to do the rest of the calculation , we consider an infinite plane with a coordinate @xmath91 in which the points differing by integer coordinates are identified and use it to parametrize the knots .",
    "each of them is then represented by a  closed \" curve in the unit square @xmath92\\times [ 0,1]$ ] . by the invariance under ( ii ) , we may stretch the curve to form a set of pararell lines ; these are periodic geodesics on the torus .",
    "we locate these to pass through the origin",
    ". then the locations of the intersections in @xmath93 and their mirrors outside @xmath93 are given by the solutions @xmath91 of @xmath94 where each set of @xmath95 and @xmath96 defines two lines and their unique intersection point .",
    "since , by the bzout s lemma , ( [ coprime ] ) implies that there exists a pair of integers @xmath95 such that @xmath97 for any integer @xmath98 and so does @xmath96 such that @xmath99 for any integer @xmath100 , one can equivalently count the solutions of , @xmath101 the set of the solutions @xmath102 forms a lattice , which can be linearly mapped from the unit square lattice @xmath103 by the multiplication of the inverse of the matrix in ( [ matrixeq ] ) . by taking the jacobian factor into account , one can count the number of the solutions in @xmath93 .",
    "we have thus shown the formula ( [ determinant ] ) .",
    "again the number of intersections is five ; the intersection at the top - right and bottom - left shoud be counted as one - half for each because of the identification .",
    "the winding numbers are given by @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "( b ) the fundumental region @xmath93 and its mirror on @xmath102-plane .",
    ", width=377 ]",
    "we first recall the coulomb gas partition function of the @xmath0 model @xcite . using the determinant formula ( [ determinant ] )",
    ", we formulate the continuum partition function of the layered model ( [ zlatnon ] ) . here the moduli parameter of the torus is denoted by @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the two basic periods .",

    "the sign is again dependent on the orientation of the crossing ; it is determined in a way parallel to the definition of @xmath46 below ( [ onvertex ] ) .",
    "since loops are closed , the correspondence between the loop and height configuration is unique up to a constant shift of the latter . on the torus",

    "quite importantly , the local fluctuation @xmath121 can be integrated out , giving @xmath122 as @xcite @xmath123 } = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{y}}|\\eta(q)|^{-2 } , \\label{z0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the variable @xmath124 and the dedekind eta function @xmath125 in the standard convention , @xmath126 @xmath127 ; the coupling @xmath128 is determined by is fixed from the requirement that the screening field @xmath129 , which originates from the discreteness of the height function @xmath130 , be marginal @xcite .",
    "this leads to the relation @xmath131 with @xmath132 defined in ( [ n2cos ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath133 such description by the local action ( [ gaussianaction ] ) corresponds to the vertex rule ( [ onvertex ] ) .",
    "thus , the weight for the non - contractible loop ( without orientation ) is automatically @xmath134 .",
    "a novel observation @xcite is that one can modify the weight for non - contractible loop as @xmath135 by exploiting the identity : @xmath136 where @xmath137 represents @xmath138 ways of the positive or the negative orientation of @xmath18 non - oriented non - contractible loops .",
    "a presence of the loop which is characterized by the coprime winding numbers @xmath139 leads to the frustration @xmath140 .",

    "since the integrand has the canonical dimension two , a possibility is that the presence of the inter - layer coupling leads to a marginal deformation of the decoupled model ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "in general , an invariance of partition functions under the modular transformation : @xmath153 imposes strong constraints on the operator content @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "our expression ( [ zlayer ] ) of the bi - layer system automatically satisfies the modular invariance . to see this , first recall that any modular transformation ( [ modular ] )",
    "can be expressed as a finite composition of the two basic transformations @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "the modular invariance of ( [ gaussian ] ) follows from the transformation properties of the frustrations ( @xmath77-dependence being suppressed ) : @xmath156 and from the basic idea of the path - integral that the sum should be taken over all the possible configurations ( here , taken over all the frustrations ) .",
    "since the gcd remains invariant under these transformation : @xmath157 the partition function of the @xmath0 model ( [ zongcd ] ) also has the modular invariance .",
    "further , the determinant has the analogous invariance , and @xmath158 transform by multiplication of the identical @xmath159 matrix , which has the determinant equal to one . ] which may be represented as @xmath160 if the determinant in ( [ cdeterminant ] ) is regarded as the third component of @xmath161 with @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "thus , under the transformations , each term in the sum ( [ zlayer ] ) changes into another term with the common extra factor , compared with ( [ gaussian ] ) , determined only from the gcd and determinant of the frustrations .",
    "this establishes the modular invariance of the partition function of the layered model ( [ zlayer ] ) .    in order to see the operator content ,",
    "we need to fourier transform the sum ( [ zlayer ] ) into a series in @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "the similar transformation for the partition function ( [ gaussian ] ) is easily done by the poisson ressumation .",
    "intuitively , this task becomes rather non - trivial for the sum with the gcd , ( [ zongcd ] ) and ( [ zlayer ] ) , because the gcd function @xmath166 has no apparent periodic structure on the @xmath167-plane ; its distribution has rather recursive ( self - similar ) and irregular pattern ( being recursive because all the prime numbers play equivalent and relatively independent roles in determining the gcd , and irregular because they appear irregularly ) .",
    "it is possible , however , to take advantage of the recursive nature by allowing deliberate overlaps and to express the sum ( [ zongcd ] ) as a superposition of sums over the periodic structures @xmath168 . in order to do this ,",

    "further , since the gcd is to be evaluated as @xmath210 , the sum over @xmath43 is just @xmath211 therefore we see that setting @xmath208 amounts to a restriction on the electoric charge in ( [ cdimension ] ) and ( [ cspin ] ) to @xmath212 with @xmath213 and a shift in @xmath214 . taking the terms with @xmath215 and the symmetry @xmath216 into account",

    ", one can in principle read off the non - trivial selection rules in the bi - layer system . in particular , it is always possible to calculate the lower spectrum by this explicit formula .",
    "it seems , however , difficult for general cases to state the selection rules in simpler form e.g. in terms of few quantum numbers .",

    "if a conformal field theory has a primary fields of dimension @xmath12 , the theory also has a descendant field of the dimension @xmath227 which is , in the algebraic setting @xcite , obtained by applying the virasoro generators @xmath228 @xmath229 to the primary such that @xmath230 .",

    "note also that the lowest - order term in ( [ gamma3 ] ) which is diagonal in @xmath164 and @xmath165 is @xmath257 , which means in our notation ( [ zbz ] ) that ( [ gamma3 ] ) is related to a model with the central charge @xmath9 rather than to that with @xmath224 if it is considered as a full partition function .",
    "it remains , however , the possibility that ( [ gamma3 ] ) forms a part of some other partition function with the central charge @xmath224 .",
    "in summary , the partition functions of the bi - layered dilute @xmath2 models and the bi - layered dense @xmath2 models both at the intersection weight @xmath4 are represented respectively by ( [ gamma32 ] ) and ( [ gamma3 ] ) , and together reproduce all of the spectrum ( [ cosetspectrum ] ) of the coset model ( [ coset ] ) .",

    "they are folded due to the symmetries of the partition function that follow from the definition ( [ lambda ] ) : @xmath261 in addition to these , as in fig .",
    "[ graph2 ] , we have an extra symmetry @xmath262 in the sectors @xmath205 . formally , this can be understood by the presence of the half - divided charge @xmath263 in ( [ zdiagoff ] ) .",
    "the four flat lines ( @xmath264 and @xmath265 ) correspond to the operators with vanishing magnetic charges @xmath206 and @xmath207 . as a result of ( [ gammahalfsymmetry ] ) , all the difference of the operator content of the model at @xmath3 to that of the model at @xmath4",
    "are contained in the sector @xmath194 ( fig . [ graph ] ) .",
    "thus , let us concentrate on the flow in the sector @xmath194 . by recognizing that these parabolas occur in sequence , we may state an interpretation of this flow as follows .",
    "if we look at the graph up - side down , these curves are regarded as some trajectories of balls in a space surrounded by the walls at @xmath152 and at @xmath239 in the presence of a uniform gravitational field .",
    "for example , if we are at @xmath266 and throw a ball in the horizontal direction to the wall at @xmath239 , then it falls down to @xmath267 as it reflects alternatively at @xmath152 and at @xmath239 .",
    "if we tune the initial velocity , it goes as @xmath268 , which in fact appears in the graph .",
    "another trajectory is @xmath269 .",
    "every collisions are perfectly elastic due to the symmetry ( [ gammasymmetry ] ) .",
    "hence , we have a law of the reflection in the spectrum .",
    "each falling trajectory carries a certain positive or negative multiplicity and implies the possibility of the operators of higher scaling dimensions at any @xmath19 . for fixed @xmath19 ,",
    "it defines a sequence of `` descendants '' . at @xmath152 , for instance , the descendants of the field of dimension @xmath270 may have dimensions @xmath271 .",
    "finally , we remark that cancellations of multiplicities may happen at particular values of @xmath19 where multiple trajectories cross each other .",
    "as we can see from ( [ decoupled ] ) , there are no diagonal terms with @xmath272 or @xmath273 .",
    "complete cancellations in fact occur both at @xmath274 and at @xmath275 .",
    "this illustrates a non - trivial aspect of the selection rules .",
    "we have introduced a bi - layered loop model in which the inter - layer coupling depends on the signed number of intersections between loops living on the different layers .",
    "the model is first defined microscopically on the lattice with the periodic boundary condition , and then the corresponding continuum partition function is proposed based on the idea of the coulomb gas . within our definition of the inter - layer coupling , the local fluctuation decouples from the topological one .",
    "accordingly , we are left with the sum over the topological sectors of two compact bosonic fields .",
    "the partition function has the modular invariance .",
    "after the poisson resummation , we have the explicit expression which reveals the operator content .",
    "each coefficient involves a combination of the ramanujan sums , and contains non - trivial selection rules .",
    "we analyze few examples of the curves of scaling dimensions induced by the inter - layer coupling ( fig .",
    "[ graph ] and [ graph2 ] ) .",
    "the layered model continuously changes itself from the decoupled model ( @xmath3 ) into the non - trivial coupled model ( @xmath4 ) , where the operator content is reorganized and the model has the simple spectrum ( [ gamma32 ] ) .    in the definition of our layered model on the lattice , loops from different layers do not overlap but instead intersect each other .",
    "this feature is unique to our model . to compare , we mention the coupled loop model whose self - dual critical point was studied by algebraic methods @xcite and the models that arise from the replica approach to the disordered models such as the random - bond @xmath164-state potts model @xcite or the disordered @xmath0 loop model @xcite . in the former model , two potts models , described respectively by two independent temperley - lieb algebras ,",
    "are considered on _ the same _ square lattice and coupled via the weight for the local overlap of loops .",
    "similarly , for the latter models , the averaging procedures lead to the models of the replicated @xmath18-layers which are coupled through the overlap of loop segments ( energy operators ) , that is , renormalized version of the bonds @xmath276 where @xmath277 is the microscopic spin .",
    "although , at this stage , we could not relate our model and these other coupled loop models , we briefly discuss a possible approach to the latter , disordered models by using the method in this paper .    in the replica method ,",
    "the intermediate layered models were analyzed for general @xmath278 by conformal perturbation theories , and then @xmath17 limits should be taken . in this way , the two lines of the non - trivial fixed point emanating from the ising point @xmath279 and @xmath255 are found @xcite . along these critical lines , the effective central charge and ,",
    "thermal and magnetic eigenvalues are estimated .",
    "they are also numerically checked , for the random potts case , using the transfer matrix @xcite .",
    "now our model can be generalized to the one consisting of @xmath18-layers .",
    "since it would be again described by a quadratic action similar to that used in this paper , it seems to be straightforward to obtain the partition function of the model for any @xmath278 .",
    "it would then give some insight on the replica limit if the analytic continuation in the variable @xmath18 and studying its @xmath17 limit could be possible at the level of the exact partition function .",
    "further important extension is within the bi - layered model but is a generalization including several number of charges @xmath280 ( @xmath281 ) , or equivalently , with several weights @xmath282 for non - contractible loops .",
    "other than at @xmath283 , this is necessary for obtaining integer coefficients . in the single - layer case , @xmath284 is taken to be the set of the eigenvalues @xcite of the adjacency matrices associated with the a - d - e dynkin diagrams . in this way",
    ", it would be possible to examine whether we have a discrete series of the models similar to the unitary minimal model @xcite in the single - layer case or not .    finally , we emphasize that the virtue of the cg method is its directness .",
    "although we have only dealt with a specific case in multilayered system , the continuum partition function was derived from the lattice formulation by a straightforward path - integral .",
    "we hope that our slight extension in two dimensions from single layer to multilayer will stimulate further progress in this direction .",
