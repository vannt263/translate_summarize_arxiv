    "the question of the integrability of the test particle motion in the zipoy - voorhees metric has recently attracted some attention , with both numerical @xcite and analytical investigations @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite were able to exclude the existence of some polynomial first integrals , but they argue that some weaker form of integrability might take place taking into account the results of @xcite . on the other hand , the results of @xcite indicate chaotic behaviour of the system , but the region where that happens is very small when compared to the phase space dominated by invariant tori , and the integration was performed with the runge - kutta method of the 5th order only . since it is known @xcite that integrable systems can exhibit numerical chaos ( particularly for the r - k method ) , the results of @xcite should be taken cautiously .",
    "our own numerical integration produced a poincar section visibly shifted from the one in @xcite ( see the end of section * iv * ) , and since we used a more accurate method , it poses the question of whether the picture would be further deformed as the precision was increased .",
    "in other words , to decide on the integrability of the problem , a rigorous mathematical analysis is required rather than numerical simulations .    the physical problem and its significance are the same as in the classical paper by carter @xcite  that the existence of an additional first integral in the kerr space - time makes the problem completely integrable .",
    "carter s integral is not generated by a killing vector , so it is not a usual symmetry of the manifold , but it is quadratic in momenta which has important consequences .",
    "such integrals translate into the separability of the hamilton - jacobi equation and dalembertian @xcite , which in turn appears in the teukolsky @xcite equation .",
    "that is to say , both the classical problem of particle motion in this space - time , the linear perturbation equations governing the gravitational waves and potentially quantum equations in that background become considerably easier to solve .",
    "this fact is also used in numerical approaches , when trying to determine possible spectra of gravitational radiation in anticipation of the observed data @xcite .",
    "it is then natural to analyze other space - times which could serve as models of compact objects , and the stationary axisymmetric ones are one direction to explore .",
    "however , despite some numerical evidence @xcite we find that the particular zipoy - voorhees metric with the parameter @xmath0 is not integrable . to be more precise",
    ", we consider the motion of a test particle as a hamiltonian system with @xmath1 degrees of freedom and ask for the existence of an additional constant of motion @xmath2 that would yield _ liouvillian integrability _ with respect to the canonical poisson bracket @xmath3 .",
    "that is , for all first integrals @xmath4 we would have @xmath5 , where the hamiltonian is included as @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are also already known .",
    "it turns out , that no such first integral can be found in the class of meromorphic functions , and we will use the differential galois theory to prove that . recall that a function is called meromorphic when its singularities ( if it has any ) are just poles ; so by allowing first integrals that are potentially singular at some points of the phase space we are considering a fairly wide class of functions .",
    "the reason for using this particular theory is that it gives the strongest known necessary conditions for the integrability of dynamical systems .",
    "it was used for proving the nonintegrability of the hardest problems of classical mechanics , like the three - body problem @xcite , which had been open for centuries . for an accessible overview of applications ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the zipoy - voorhees metric under consideration is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 form the prolate spheroidal coordinates . instead of working directly with the geodesic equations we take the hamiltonian approach with @xmath12 where the canonical coordinates are @xmath13 the equations then read @xmath14 with @xmath15 , and the normalization of four - velocities gives the value of the ( conserved ) hamiltonian to be @xmath16 .",
    "the new time parameter is the rescaled proper time @xmath17 , which allows us to include the zero geodesics for photons without introducing another affine parameter but with simply @xmath18 .",
    "since the metric has two killing vector fields @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the two momenta @xmath21 and @xmath22 are conserved . together with the hamiltonian they provide three first integrals .",
    "the question then is whether there exists one more first integral that would make the system liouville integrable . to answer this question",
    "we employ the differential galois approach to integrability .",
    "more specifically , we use the main theorem of the morales - ramis theory @xcite .",
    "[ mr ] if a complex hamiltonian system is completely integrable with meromorphic first integrals , then the identity component of the differential galois group of the variational and the normal variational equations along any nonconstant particular solution of this system is abelian .",
    "let us try to explain the involved mathematics somewhat . for detailed exposition of the differential galois theory the reader",
    "is referred to books @xcite .",
    "the morales - ramis theory is exposed in @xcite , and a short introduction with application to another relativistic system can be found in @xcite .    to describe the differential galois approach to the integrability we consider a general system of differential equations @xmath23 we assume that the right - hand sides @xmath24 are meromorphic in the considered domain .",
    "let @xmath25 be a nonequilibrium solution of this system .",
    "then the variational equation ( ve ) along this solution have the form @xmath26 it is not difficult to prove that if the original system has an analytic first integral @xmath27 , then the variational equation have a time - dependent first integral @xmath28 which is polynomial in @xmath29 .",
    "similarly , one can show that if @xmath27 is a meromorphic first integral , then the variational equations   have a first integral @xmath28 which is rational in @xmath29 .",
    "the ziglin lemma , see p. 64 in @xcite , says that if the system   has @xmath30 functionally independent first integrals @xmath31 , @xmath32 , then the variational equations   have the same number functionally independent first integrals @xmath33 which are rational functions of @xmath29 .    in the considered theory , time",
    "is assumed to be a complex variable , and for complex @xmath34 , the solution @xmath25 can have singularities .",
    "assume that @xmath35 is not a singular point of @xmath25 .",
    "then in a neighborhood of @xmath36 there exist @xmath37 linearly independent solutions of the variational equations  .",
    "they are the columns of the fundamental matrix @xmath38 of the system  .",
    "this matrix can be analytically continued along an arbitrary path @xmath39 on the complex plane avoiding the singularities of the solution @xmath25 .",
    "assume that @xmath39 is such a closed path , or loop , with the base point @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath40 be a continuation of @xmath38 .",
    "solutions of a system of @xmath1 linear equations form a linear @xmath1-dimensional space . thus , in a neighborhood of @xmath36 , each column of @xmath40 is a linear combination of columns of @xmath38 .",
    "we can write this fact in the form @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a complex nonsingular matrix , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "in fact , the matrix @xmath42 depends only on the homotopy class @xmath44 $ ] of the loop . taking all loops with the base point @xmath36 we obtain an a group of matrices @xmath45 which is called the monodromy group of the equation  .",
    "one can show that if @xmath46 is a first integral of  , then @xmath47 for an arbitrary @xmath48 , and for an arbitrary @xmath49 from a neighborhood of @xmath36 .",
    "in other words , if the original system has a meromorphic first integral , then the monodromy group has a rational invariant .",
    "hence , if the system possesses a big number of first integrals , then the monodromy group of variational equations can not be too big because it has a large number of independent rational invariants .",
    "this observation can be transformed into an effective tool if we restrict our attention to hamiltonian systems and the integrability in the liouville sense ( complete integrability ) .",
    "the above facts are the basic ideas of the elegant ziglin theory @xcite .",
    "the problem in applying this theory is that the monodromy group is known for a very limited number of equations .",
    "at the end of the previous century the ziglin theory found a nice generalization .",
    "it was developed by baider , churchill , morales , ramis , rod , sim and singer , see @xcite and references therein . in the context of hamiltonian systems",
    "it is called the morales - ramis theory , and in some sense , it is an algebraic version of the ziglin theory .",
    "it formulates the necessary conditions for the integrability in terms of the differential galois group @xmath50 of the variational equations .",
    "it is known that it is a linear algebraic group and that it contains the the monodromy group . by definition",
    "it is a subgroup of @xmath51 which preserves all polynomial relations between solutions of the considered linear system , see @xcite ; and for a wide class of equations it is generated by @xmath52 .",
    "the differential galois group can serve for a study of integrability problems on the same footing as the monodromy group .",
    "namely , first integrals of   give rational invariants of @xmath53 .",
    "if the considered system is hamiltonian then necessarily @xmath54 , and groups @xmath52 and @xmath53 are subgroups of the symplectic group @xmath55 . it can also be shown that the differential galois group @xmath53 is a lie group . if the system is completely integrable with @xmath1 meromorphic first integrals , then @xmath53 has @xmath1 commuting rational invariants .",
    "the key lemma , see p. 72 in @xcite , states that if the above is the case , then the lie algebra of @xmath53 is abelian .",
    "this means exactly that the identity component of @xmath53 is abelian .",
    "determination of the differential galois group is a difficult task .",
    "fortunately , in the context of integrability , we need to know only if its identity component is abelian .",
    "if it is not abelian then the system is nonintegrable .",
    "if we find that a subsystem of ve has a non - abelian identity component of the differential galois group , then conclusions are the same .",
    "this is why , in practice , we always try to distinguish a subsystem of ve .",
    "it is easy to notice that @xmath56 is a solution of  . using it we can reduce the dimension of ve by one .",
    "if the system   is hamiltonian , then first we restrict it to the energy level of the particular solution . in effect , in hamiltonian context we can easily distinguish a subsystem of variational equations of dimension @xmath57 , which are called the normal variational equations ( nve ) .",
    "the difficulty of investigation of the differential galois group of nve depends , among other things , on the form of its matrix of coefficients , and so also on the functional form of particular solution . quite often , by an introduction of a new independent variable @xmath58",
    "we can transform nve to a system with rational coefficients @xmath59 , \\quad b_{i , j}(z)\\in\\mathbb{c}(z ) .      \\label{linsys}\\ ] ]    the set of rational functions @xmath60 is a field , and equipped with the usual differentiation it becomes a differential field .",
    "solutions of a system with rational coefficients are typically not rational .",
    "the smallest differential field containing all solutions of   is called the picard - vessiot extension of @xmath60 .",
    "the differential galois group @xmath53 of   tells us how complicated its solutions are , i.e. , if the equations are solvable . here",
    "solvability means that all solutions can be obtained from a rational function by a finite number of integrations , exponentiation and algebraic operations @xcite .",
    "this category of functions , called liouvillian , includes all elementary functions , as well as some transcendental , such as the logarithm or elliptic integrals , and is commonly referred to as `` closed - form '' or `` explicit '' solutions .",
    "the following classical result connects the structure of @xmath53 with the form of the solutions .",
    "system is solvable , i.e. , all its solutions are liouvillian , if and only if the the identity component of its differential galois group is solvable ,    the connection of this theorem with integrability is the following . if it is possible to show that either nve , or a subsystem of nve are not solvable , then the identity component of their differential galois group is not solvable , so , in particular is not abelian .",
    "thus , by theorem  [ mr ] , the system is not integrable . the question of whether a given system with rational coefficient is solvable can be resolved completely for a system of two equations ( or one equation of second order ) . in this case",
    "there is an effective algorithm by kovacic for finding the liouvillian solutions @xcite .",
    "this algorithm gives a definite answer , and if liouvillian solutions exist it provides their analytical form .",
    "there exist a similar , almost complete algorithm for systems of three equations and some partial results for systems of four equations .",
    "the plan of attack is thus to look for particular solutions for which the nve has a block structure so that a two - dimensional subsystem can be separated .",
    "we then rewrite it as a second - order linear differential equation with rational coefficients and apply the kovacic algorithm to see if it has any liouvillian solutions .",
    "note that the system has no external parameters , and only the values of particular first integrals enter as internal parameters .",
    "they are synonymous with initial conditions , so that if we manage to find just one solution , for particular values of @xmath61 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , such that the respective nve is unsolvable , we will have proven that there can not exist another first integral over the whole phase space .",
    "it might so happen , unlike in the carter case , that the system exhibits some particular invariant set on which there exists an additional integral .",
    "for example , one could have @xmath62 , which would mean that @xmath63 is conserved on the zero - energy hypersurface @xmath64 , which is clearly a physically distinguished case .",
    "we will then have to look for particular solutions on those sets to make the results even more restrictive than just the lack of a global first integral .    the obvious particular solution to look at",
    "is a particle moving along a straight line , through the center in the equatorial plane , which in prolate coordinates means @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the nontrivial equations then read : @xmath67 or , upon rescaling time by @xmath68 we have @xmath69 where the dot denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath70 , and we have omitted the first equation , as the other two do not depend on @xmath71 .",
    "this two - dimensional subsystem defines the particular solution around which we will construct the nve as mentioned before .",
    "the conservation of the hamiltonian now reads @xmath72 which together with the equation for @xmath73 yields @xmath74 so that @xmath75 is expressible by the jacobi elliptic functions .",
    "this fact is important , as we will change the independent variable from @xmath70 to @xmath9 which is permissible ( does not change the identity component of the galois group ) only if the function @xmath75 defines a finite cover of the complex plane @xcite .",
    "the variational equations along this solution separate so that the nve read @xmath76 where the variations @xmath29 correspond to the perturbations of variables @xmath10 and @xmath77 .",
    "this is another step of the reduction mentioned in the previous section ",
    "the particular solution only have @xmath9 and @xmath78 components , and the nve only has components in the orthogonal directions of @xmath10 and @xmath77 .    introducing a new dependent variable @xmath79 and taking @xmath9 as the new independent variable",
    ", the nve can be brought to the standard form of @xmath80 with the rational coefficient @xmath81 @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the following polynomial @xmath84    since for all physical particles we have @xmath85 all the others parameters can be rescaled by it @xmath86 which we use in what follows .    as is customary , we will use the same notation as in kovacic s paper , adhering exactly to the steps and cases of the algorithm @xcite .",
    "we note that a linear equation like has local solutions in some neighborhood of a singularity @xmath87 of @xmath88 , which take the form @xmath89 where @xmath90 is analytic at zero , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 is called the characteristic exponent .",
    "the algorithm checks if it is possible to construct a global solution , which , in the simplest case , is of the form @xmath93 for a polynomial @xmath94 and rational @xmath95 .",
    "the degree of @xmath96 is then linked with the exponents and that provides preliminary restrictions on the parameters values and integrability .",
    "the application of the algorithm itself is straightforward , and the only complication is that the singularities and exponents might depend on parameters .",
    "fortunately there are only several special values of @xmath61 that influence the outcome , and we outline the general steps in the two subsections below . for details ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite , and another version of the algorithm , as applied to the dynamical system of the bianchi viii cosmology , can be found in @xcite .",
    "the poles of @xmath88 are @xmath97 and for all of them to be different we must have @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "all are of order 2 , and the order at infinity is 4 , so that we need to check all the cases of the algorithm .    in case 1 ,",
    "the characteristic exponents @xmath100 of form the following set @xmath101 where the first pair corresponds to @xmath102 , and the combinations @xmath103 give only nine non - negative integers ( not all distinct ) as possible degrees of the appropriate polynomial @xmath96 , which enters into the solution of .",
    "however , the respective test solutions of the form as in require that @xmath64 , and have to be discarded so that this case can not hold .    in case 2 , the families of exponents @xmath104 are @xmath105 which in turn give 131 possible integer degrees for the appropriate polynomial . checking them one by one , we find that they require @xmath106 in order to form a solution , so that this case can be discarded as well under the current assumptions .    in case 3 , the families @xmath104 contain @xmath107 numbers , which make 4826809 combinations for @xmath108 out of which 230856 are non - negative integers .",
    "we thus first resort to checking for the presence of logarithms in the solutions , which would prevent this case @xcite .",
    "the only poles with integer difference in the exponents are 0 and @xmath102 . using the frobenius method @xcite",
    ", we get the two independent solutions around zero @xmath109 as can be seen , the logarithm is present when @xmath110 , and since the solutions around @xmath102 do not have logarithms at all , the only possibility for case 3 left here is with @xmath111 .      in order to exclude the special energy hypersurfaces @xmath64 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , we have to resort to a more general particular solution , namely one with @xmath114 . as already mentioned , it is enough to find one solution for each such surface , and that means we can take a specific value of @xmath22 .",
    "the corresponding nve will only have numeric coefficients , and checking for its liouvillian solutions is much easier , for it suffices to use one of available implemented routines , for example the `` kovacicsols '' of the symbolic system maple .",
    "the solution will also be expressible by ( hyper)elliptic function as defined by the hamiltonian constraint @xmath115 and the counterparts of the nve given in will read @xmath116 we then proceed exactly as above , taking @xmath9 as the independent variable and reducing the system to one equation of the form @xmath117 . for each hypersurface in question , the value of @xmath118 leads to nve that are not solvable with liouvillian functions .",
    "this finishes the proof for all possible levels of the hamiltonian .    to further illustrate the complexity of this system",
    ", we have also obtained a poincar section for the cross plane @xmath65 shown in fig . [ fig ] .",
    "the numerical integrator was based on the bulirsch - stoer modified midpoint scheme with richardson extrapolation .",
    "we note that the special solution defined by lies entirely in the plane @xmath65 and is a trajectory beginning and ending at the singularity so it does not contribute to the section .",
    "it also lies outside the visible chaotic region , which is confined to a very small subset of the phase space , as mentioned in @xcite .",
    "the above results carry , to some extent , to the general zipoy - voorhees metric given by @xmath119 where @xmath120 .",
    "the main problem that arises for arbitrary @xmath121 is that the special solution might no longer be a ( hyper)elliptic function , because the hamiltonian now gives @xmath122 so the right - hand side is not necessarily a polynomial or rational function .",
    "accordingly , the rationalization of the nve might not preserve the identity component of the differential galois group .",
    "however , when @xmath121 is rational we can still proceed by taking a new dependent variable to be @xmath123 as this leads to the normal form which involves only integral powers of @xmath124 and @xmath125 . assuming then that @xmath126",
    ", we can make the nve rational by taking @xmath127 as the new variable if need be .",
    "unfortunately , the number of poles ( and their values ) now depends on @xmath128 and @xmath129 , so the kovacic algorithm has to be applied to each @xmath121 separately , but for each of them it is as straightforward as above to use the maple package , once suitable numeric values of the parameters have been chosen .",
    "for example , we have verified that @xmath130 is also nonintegrable , confirming the numerical evidence of @xcite that for both @xmath131 and @xmath132 , the general metric does not admit additional first integrals .",
    "our main result can be stated as      this confirms the previous considerations of @xcite and goes much further than excluding first integrals polynomial in momenta up to a certain fixed small degree .",
    "meromorphic functions include not only the analytic functions of both momenta and coordinates , but also rational and transcendental ones as long as their singularities are just poles .",
    "in particular , it follows that even if a conserved quantity exists , it can not be expressed by an explicit formula of the above type .",
    "this result thus strongly reduces the possibility of using constants of motion expansion in solving the equations of geodesic motion or gravitational waves because the decomposition in terms of normal frequencies requires one to calculate their values directly from the initial conditions of the coordinates and momenta @xcite .",
    "of course , further techniques can be used to better understand and describe the motion , especially in the region where the dynamics is regular , but the fundamental physical property of this space - time is that no additional conservation law holds .",
