    "the study of the mechanisms responsible for the formation of structures in the universe was started by the pioneer work of jeans ( 1902 , 1928 ) . studying the conditions under which a cloud of gas ( in a static background ) becomes gravitationally unstable under its own gravity jeans concluded that perturbations with masses smaller than a `` critical '' value @xmath5 ( the jeans mass ) do not grow and behave like acoustic waves whereas perturbations with a mass @xmath6 bigger than @xmath5 grow under the effect of their self - gravity , leading to gravitationally bound structures .    since then",
    ", the mechanism proposed by jeans has been extensively applied as a criterion of stability in several models of galaxy formation . however , by the recombination epoch ( which is believed to be the one after which baryonic perturbations could begin to grow ) , the critical scale predicted by the classical jeans theory is not at all related to the galactic scale .",
    "instead , it is well known that just before recombination the critical jeans mass is @xmath7m@xmath8 , ( i.e. the mass of rich clusters or even superclusters of galaxies ) , and immediately after recombination the jeans mass drops abruptly , more than 10 orders of magnitude , to a value @xmath9m@xmath8 , which is related to the mass of globular clusters ( weinberg 1972 ; zeldovich & novikov 1983 ) .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy between the jeans mass , before and after recombination , and the mass of a typical galaxy , a few @xmath10m@xmath8 , has not been , up to now , well understood .",
    "one should emphasize , however , that these values for the jeans mass just before and just after recombination epoch are obtained assuming a baryon - dominated universe .",
    "on the other hand , the observation of flat galactic rotation curves at large galactic radii as well as high galaxy velocity dispersions in clusters has led to the missing mass problem and to the dark matter conjecture to solve it .",
    "this fact has , in particular , led to the hypothesis that dark matter halos exist around galaxies .",
    "the existence of dark matter therefore also implies that when studying the dynamics and the formation of structures in the universe one can not use the simple jeans stability criterion for a one component gas , but one has to study how does the gravitational instability arise in a mixture of at least two components .",
    "this formulation of the problem leads to a different jeans mass , as well as to a better understanding of the origin of galactic mass spectrum .",
    "this will be the main goal of this paper .",
    "we must note that , after we finished this work , it was pointed out to us by dr .",
    "varun sahni that this problem had already been studied , using a different formalism , by some russian authors like grishchuk & zeldovich ( 1981 ) or polyachenko & fridman ( 1981 ) .",
    "although having reached some of our conclusions , such studies lack most of the features present in this work .",
    "in particular they do not refer to the existence of the resonance we shall point out in this paper .",
    "since it is generally accepted that dark matter is constituted by wimps , ( weakly interacting massive particles ) in this study we shall consider the case for which the two components of the cosmic fluid interact only gravitationally .",
    "the two fluid components that we shall consider will be a baryonic one and a hot dark matter ( hdm ) one , hereafter component @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "the latter being assumed to be made of neutrino - like particles .",
    "although the numerical results obtained in this paper refer to the particular case of hdm , one should point out that the formalism here developed is quite general and applies to any type of a two - component mixture .    in sect .",
    "[ sec.equ ] we shall establish the linear coupled equations which describe the dynamical system for the density perturbations in the two - component fluid we wish to study .",
    "we shall then develop , in sect .",
    "[ sec.qual ] , a qualitative analysis of the dynamical system .    in sect .",
    "[ sec.sol ] we shall study the behaviour , in phase - space , of the trajectories representing the general solution of the dynamical system . this analytical study will be complemented with some numerical plots in order to clarify some of the qualitative results obtained .    for numerical purposes we shall consider that the onset of gravitational instability occurs in a flat @xmath13 universe at recombination epoch , after the decoupling between radiation and baryonic matter , when the radiation temperature is @xmath14 k ( kolb & turner 1990 ) .",
    "we shall assume that the density parameter @xmath15 has a value in agreement with the limits imposed by standard nucleosynthesis ( walker et al .",
    "assuming @xmath16 h @xmath17 , where h is the hubble constant in units of @xmath18 km / s / mpc , i.e. h = h@xmath19(@xmath18 km / s / mpc ) , such a value is @xmath20 .",
    "the neutrino - like particles which constitute the dark matter component are assumed to have a mass compatible with the assumption of being already non - relativistic by the recombination epoch .",
    "it will be shown later in this paper that this value for the mass of the dark matter particles seems to provide a good fit for the galactic mass spectrum .    in sect .",
    "[ sec.res ] we shall describe the occurence of a resonance which , in our opinion , is responsible for the formation of structure at the typical galactic scales .    the relation between the existence of the resonance , the galactic scale and the mass of dark matter particles is discussed in sect .",

    "[ sec.con ] and [ sec.fut ] we shall point out the main results presented in this paper and outline some open questions as well as the research paths we intend to follow in the near future .",
    "the dynamics of a non - relativistic self - gravitating fluid can be described by the usual set of hydrodynamical equations : continuity equation , euler equation and poisson s equation .    in this paper",
    "we shall neglect the expansion of the universe , since we shall be interested only in the qualitative behaviour , at the onset of the process of growth of density perturbations in the post recombination epoch , and not in the exact dynamics of the process .    in this case , for a fluid made of two components , @xmath12 and @xmath11 , the above set of equations",
    "becomes :    @xmath21    @xmath22    @xmath23    @xmath24    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the total self - gravitational potential , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are respectively the density , velocity and pressure fields for fluid elements of component @xmath30 , ( the index @xmath30 taking the values @xmath12 or @xmath11 ) .    using a perturbative analysis , to first order in the perturbation , one can write the dynamical variables as follows :    @xmath31    where the index `` @xmath32 '' indicates the unperturbed value , and @xmath33 the first order perturbation .",
    "it s common to consider the zero order solution to be an infinite fluid at rest , ( @xmath34 ) , for which the density and pressure are the same everywhere ( unperturbed fluid ) .",
    "we must point out , as it is well known , that this static solution for the unperturbed state of the above equations is not mathematically correct , except for @xmath35 .",
    "however , since this problem is removed when considering the more realistic case of a fluid embedded in the expanding universe , ( which we shall discuss in a forthcoming paper ) , one can start perturbing this static configuration in order to obtain some qualitative information on the fluid behaviour .",
    "we shall assume that the solutions of the above coupled system of eqs .",

    "( [ eq.a ] ) - ( [ eq.e ] ) leads to the following equations :    @xmath36    where the double dot stands for second time derivative , @xmath0 is the wave number of the perturbation . for each of the components @xmath30 ,",
    "the parameter @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the density contrast @xmath40 and @xmath41 the adiabatic sound speed given by @xmath42 .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath37 , at the cosmic time of recombination , @xmath43 , can be related to the density parameter , @xmath44 , of component @xmath30 , by    @xmath45    the adiabatic sound speed in component @xmath30 at recombination , @xmath46 , is the sound speed of a monoatomic ideal gas , which is given by :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the boltzman constant and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are respectively the temperature at recombination and mass of the particles of component @xmath30 .",
    "one should emphasize , that from the decoupling between the neutrino - like particles and radiation until the epoch at which these particles become non - relativistic , ( which occurs for a red - shift @xmath51 , doroshkevich et al .",
    "1988 ) , their temperature t@xmath52 is given by t@xmath53t@xmath54 , where t@xmath54 is the radiation temperature . since then , it decays with @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the scale factor of the universe ( gao & ruffini 1981 ; padmanabhan 1993 ) .",
    "one can therefore estimate that , at the recombination epoch , such a dark component @xmath12 will have a temperature t@xmath57 k    the above system ( [ eq.j ] ) of two linear differential equations of second order can be transformed into the following autonomous dynamical system of four first order differential equations which one can write in a matrix form as :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 , the superscript @xmath60 standing for transpose .",

    "these solutions are given by the second and fourth components , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , of the general solution @xmath65 , of the dynamical system ( [ eq.1 ] ) .",
    "using methods of qualitative theory of differential equations one can analyse the dynamical system and obtain some qualitative information on the behaviour of the perturbations .",
    "this will help understanding the stability , against density perturbations , of the two - component system .",
    "even in a case like this one where an explicit solution exists , this is worth doing .",
    "alternatively the autonomous dynamical system can be numerically studied provided we specify the initial condition @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the cosmic time at which the equilibrium state of the fluid is perturbed .",
    "we shall analyse the system qualitatively and , whenever it proves convenient , to clarify any result , we shall illustrate this study with some numerical plots .",

    "+ solutions in a center subspace oscillate at constant amplitude , and therefore density perturbations with wave number @xmath109 ca nt grow .",
    "this case corresponds to the existence of two pairs of acoustic wave modes propagating in the fluid with different phase velocities . in the limit of small wavelengths",
    ", it is easy to see that these modes have the same dispersion relations and compositions as two completely uncoupled acoustic waves propagating in pure @xmath12 and @xmath11 fluids .",
    "this is due to the fact that the role played by their self gravity , which is the only mechanism coupling the two components , is not important at small scales .",

    "+ the analysis of the composition of these modes shows that all of them envolve both components @xmath12 and @xmath11 , and are completely coupled through gravity , which , at these large scales plays an important role .",
    "one can then conclude that growth of density perturbations is possible only for @xmath2 .",
    "note that for all @xmath2 this growth affects the two components ( i.e. the mixture ) and not only one of them .",
    "this is the reason why we called @xmath1 the jeans wave number of the mixture .",

    "it is interesting to note that although this scale length is related to the jeans lengths , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , of the two components when taken separately it does not coincide , in the general case , with none of them .",
    "in fact from relation ( [ eq.3 ] ) one can see that @xmath127 .    since we are mainly interested in structure formation we shall consider , in what follows , only the case when @xmath2 , ( i.e. @xmath128 ) .",
    "in order to study the behaviour with scale of the dynamical system at the onset of the structure formation process , one needs to analyse the @xmath0-dependence of the eigenvalues @xmath105 , the eigenvectors @xmath78 and the coefficients @xmath76 , which appear in eq .",
    "( [ eq.1-a ] ) .    since @xmath129 and @xmath130 we shall only study the dependence with scale of the real eigenvalue @xmath120 and of the imaginary part of @xmath122 .",

    "however @xmath120 does not grow at the same rate for all scales .",
    "in fact there are two particular scales at which a significant change in its growth rate occurs .",
    "the first one is the jeans scale - length of the mixture , @xmath131 , where , after changing from an imaginary to a real value , @xmath120 increases very fast and then slows down , remaining approximately constant until the second peculiar scale is reached , which occurs near the jeans scale - length of the dark matter component , @xmath126 , where @xmath120 grows faster again . beyond this region",
    "the growth of @xmath120 slows down again and approaches the asymptotic value @xmath132 as @xmath133 ; see eqs .",
    "( [ eq.4 ] ) and ( [ eq.6 ] ) .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath122 is a decaying function of scale and the only change in its behaviour occurs at a scale which coincides with the second peculiar scale for @xmath120 , ( i.e. for a scale near @xmath126 ) , where a faster decrease than for any other region of the scale range , is observed . for greater scales it approaches zero as @xmath133 .",
    "since @xmath122 is the frequency associated to the acoustic modes one can see , from its dependence with scale , that although oscillations are present in all scales , for large scales acoustic waves have their frequency approaching zero , i.e. their period tends to infinity .",
    "[ fig.1 ] .",
    "additional information about the system behaviour can be obtained studying the trajectories in phase - space corresponding to the general solution @xmath65 ; unfortunately , since the phase - space is of dimension four , they are hard to visualise . however , since , as referred above , we are particularly interested in the qualitative behaviour of the second and fourth components of the general solution @xmath134 , i.e. the behaviour of the density perturbations @xmath135 and @xmath136 , we shall infer some properties of the dynamical evolution of the density perturbations analysing the behaviour of the projection , on the plane @xmath137 , of the phase - space four - dimensional trajectories .",
    "looking at the components of the eigenvectors , given by the relations ( [ eq.4 ] ) - ( [ eq.10 ] ) , one can see that the projection , on the plane @xmath138 , of the stable subspace coincides with that of the unstable subspace ( since @xmath139 ) .",

    "the other hand @xmath145 means that , in the acoustic modes , the two components oscillate with opposite phases ; when the density in one of them is growing , the density in the other is decreasing .",
    "the direct product of the stable and unstable subspaces forms a two dimensional subspace which is usually called a _",
    "saddle subspace _ and solutions in such a subspace are simultaneously pulled towards the equilibrium point along the stable axis and pushed away from it along the unstable axis .",
    "the result is that when the time @xmath146 varies from @xmath147 to @xmath148 the orbits representing these particular solutions are initially attracted by the critical point reaching a closest approach to the origin at a time @xmath149 after which they are repelled away .",
    "choosing initial conditions such that @xmath150 , i.e. @xmath151 lies on the plane @xmath138 , and given the symmetry , in first and third components , between the eigenvectors @xmath152 and @xmath153 , one concludes that the closest approach from the origin of these orbits , is attained at initial time @xmath67 , ( i.e. @xmath154 ) .",

    "it is worth noting that this condition ( @xmath151 lying on the @xmath156 plane ) , corresponds to the reasonable assumption that the mixture starts to collapse from rest .",
    "moreover , since the effect of the center subspace is to force the orbit to oscillate , one shall have a projected path which oscillates around the projection of the saddle subspace , i.e. around the straight line given by eq .",

    "[ fig.subs ] .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the rates of change with scale of both @xmath161 and @xmath162 are not constant .",

    "[ fig.b13 ] .",
    "in fact from this plot , or alternatively analysing expressions ( [ eq.13 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq.13-a ] ) , one can notice that for @xmath178 ( i.e. @xmath179 ) , @xmath161 and @xmath162 are slowly increasing functions , while when @xmath163 reaches the order of @xmath126 they become much steeper functions of @xmath163 . for values of @xmath163 above this scale the rate of change of @xmath161 and @xmath162 slows down again as @xmath161 and @xmath162 approach the asymptotic values 1 and @xmath180 respectively .",
    "this means that the composition of the mixture in the collapsing mode changes substantially when the perturbation scale is of the order of @xmath126 , starting to involve , at this scale , a much greater part of the dark material which , for smaller scales , was mainly oscillating in the acoustic mode .    further on , it will be shown that there is a critical scale @xmath181 where a resonance between the two components occurs is in the particular case we are considering of the order of @xmath126 as shall be seen later .",

    "[ fig.orb ] ) .",
    "one must also point out that if one allows @xmath208 and/or @xmath209 the expressions ( [ eq.19 ] ) for @xmath76 , and consequently the expressions ( [ eq.19-c ] ) for @xmath210 , become more complicated , and therefore dificult to be studied analytically .",
    "the general analytical study of the mode amplitudes , in the case when all the @xmath211 , is under development and we intend to publish it in a forthcoming paper .",
    "however preliminary numerical results seem to indicate that no significant change occurs in the behaviour of the mode amplitudes .",
    "looking at the behaviour of the amplitudes @xmath206 , one should first of all point out that , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq.7 ] ) , one can see that the pairs @xmath212 and @xmath213 are related by :    @xmath214    this means that a maximum of @xmath215 corresponds to a minimum of @xmath216 and a maximum of @xmath217 corresponds to a minimum of @xmath218 or inversely .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] , where the numerial plot illustrates the dependence of @xmath219 on scale , and shows its resonant behaviour for @xmath220 , and in fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] , where the sharp minimum occurring for the coefficient @xmath221 is observed at the same value of the scale length . in the numerical plot of fig .",
    "[ fig.coefd ] we also illustrate the behaviour of the coefficients @xmath222 and @xmath223 .    physically , this means that the occurrence of a resonance ( presence of maxima in @xmath215 or @xmath217 ) , is related with the fact that at the resonant scale the ratio between the number of particles which populate the collapse and decaying modes and the number of particles of the same component which populate the acoustic mode grows substantially when compared with the same ratio in nearby scales .",
    "therefore one can say that most of the resonant material is collapsing and little is left oscillating , with the oscillating mode helping to devoid the background to make a greater percentage of the particles participate in the collapse .",
    "the occurrence of such a resonance can be interpreted as a consequence of the following :    as pointed out by grishchuk & zeldovich ( 1981 ) , the dynamical system ( [ eq.1 ] ) represents two gravitationally coupled oscillators . if one takes the two components @xmath11 and @xmath12 separately , the dispersion relations , for perturbations in those separate components , give us the natural frequencies of oscillation , i.e. the ones the components would have if uncoupled , which are given by    @xmath224    and @xmath225 where @xmath226 and @xmath227 are the natural frequencies for components @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq.19-d ] ) and ( [ eq.19-e ] ) one can see that the two natural frequencies coincide for a wave number @xmath228 given by    @xmath229    this means that @xmath228 is the characteristic wave number for which perturbations in the two components , taken separately , would have the same collapse time scales .",
    "thus it is reasonable to expect a resonance to occur , at least in some of the mode amplitudes of the perturbations , for a value of @xmath0 near @xmath228 .",
    "in fact it will be shown below that such a resonance does indeed occur .",
    "the scale length corresponding to @xmath228 is given by    @xmath230^{1/2}.    \\label{eq.19-g}\\ ] ]    in the case when @xmath231 and @xmath232 one can see that @xmath181 is of the order of @xmath126 , as noted in the last section .",
    "this resonance has physical meaning only if the value of @xmath228 is real and positive .",
    "looking at eq .",
    "( [ eq.19-f ] ) one can see that this can only happen in the case when the gravitationally dominant component , i.e. the one with a greater value of @xmath233 , has also a greater sound speed , otherwise the scale for which the two components have equal natural frequencies will be a physical meaningless imaginary one .",
    "therefore , in what follows , it will be assumed that @xmath234 and @xmath235 .",
    "this is a necessary condition for the existence of a resonance in the system .",
    "when applied to our universe , for which the observational evidences seem to indicate to be dominated by dark matter , ( i.e. @xmath234 ) , this means that such a resonance can not occur in a cold dark matter ( cdm ) dominated universe .    as can be seen in eqs .",
    "( [ eq.19-c ] ) , the peculiar behaviour of @xmath161 and @xmath162 for @xmath236 mentioned in the preceding section , is responsible for the fact that , from all the perturbations which can start to grow at the recombination epoch , those with masses of the order of @xmath237 are the ones which are going to present , at the onset of the gravitational instability , the biggest amplitude , in the collapse mode . in this sense",
    "the scale @xmath181 is a privileged one .",
    "however one must be careful in interpreting this result since it is valid only for the onset of the instability and can not be extrapolated in time . to have a correct idea about the dynamical evolution of the perturbations one has to solve a more complicated problem ,",
    "i.e. we must include , in the equations , the terms due to the expansion of the universe , which allows us to obtain the correct growth rate of the perturbations . on the other hand",
    "another dificulty arises because we solve the equations only for one fourier component of the general solution which separates a perturbation into distinct wavelengths that , in principle , have distinct growth rates .",
    "therefore at any epoch the density contrast in a perturbed region of scale @xmath238 must be _ integrated _ in all the region , i.e. for all @xmath0 in the range @xmath239 , ( see padmanabhan 1993 ) .    in particular , before a careful analysis of these two points is made , one can not know which perturbations are the first to reach the non linear regime .",
    "this is a very important question that we shall address in a forthcoming paper ( in preparation ) .    since the growing mode is the one that leads to structure formation we shall be particularly interested in the behaviour of the coefficients @xmath222 and @xmath219 which are the ones associated to that mode .",
    "we shall therefore proceed by analysing the functions @xmath215 and @xmath217 .",

    "we shall , therefore , from now on study only the behaviour of the mode amplitude @xmath217 which is the one associated to the growing mode in the baryonic component .    substituting the value of @xmath249 given by eq .",

    ", one can say that @xmath253 .    from this expression",
    "it is clear that the height of the resonant peak increases as the parameter @xmath244 , ( in this case of the order of @xmath254 ) , increases .",
    "this means that the more the universe is dominated by dark matter , the more the effect of the structure formation resonance in the baryonic material will be important .    in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] the amplitude @xmath219 , of the growing mode in the baryonic component , is ploted as a function of the mass scale of the perturbation , for @xmath255 , which corresponds to assume that @xmath256 , using for @xmath15 and @xmath257 the values @xmath258 and @xmath259 respectively .",
    "this is to be compared with the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig.multzeta3 ] where other values of the parameter @xmath244 were used .",
    "the importance of the resonance can be also measured by the width of its band : a larger resonant band corresponds to a weaker resonance ( feynman 1966 ) .",
    "we shall define the resonant band width @xmath260 as the width of the curve of @xmath261 at half the maximum of its height .",
    "the two values of @xmath0 ( @xmath262 ) , which define the resonant band width @xmath263 , must therefore satisfy the following condition :    @xmath264    and are given by    @xmath265^{1/2 }    \\label{eq.104}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath266    and    @xmath267^{1/2 }      \\label{eq.106}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for given sound speeds of the two components one can see that this width is very sensitive to the product @xmath268 . on the other hand , the further apart the sound speeds @xmath269 and @xmath270 in the two components are , the smaller the resonant band width will be , indicating a stronger and sharper resonance .",
    "another feature one should point out is the behaviour of @xmath219 to the left and to the right of the resonant scale .",
    "since there is no growing mode for @xmath271 , we shall be interested in studying the behaviour of @xmath219 for the limits @xmath183 and @xmath272 .",
    "the value of @xmath219 in the limit @xmath183 , depends on the values of @xmath273 and @xmath274 and is given by :    @xmath275    whereas the value of @xmath219 for @xmath276 depends on both the sound speeds and on the densities of the two components , and is given by :    @xmath277    assuming , as above , that @xmath278 , the asymptotic value @xmath279 , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq.109 ] ) , while , if one allows @xmath244 to be much smaller than @xmath280 , then @xmath281 .    on the other hand , in the case @xmath282 , and for reasonable values of @xmath244 ,",
    "the value of @xmath283 is always of the order of @xmath284 .",
    "one can therefore conclude that the @xmath219 curve has a different behaviour on the far left and on the far right of the resonant scale .",
    "for small scales the value of @xmath219 does not vary very much with initial conditions , while for great scales that value is very sensitive to initial conditions .",
    "the smaller the initial perturbation in the dark component when compared with the initial perturbation in the baryonic component , the smaller will be the value of the mode amplitude in the growing mode of the baryonic component . for scales larger than the resonant one , favouring , in consequence , the onset of perturbations at the resonant scale or smaller ( relative to greater ones ) .",
    "the inverse occurs if the perturbation in the dark component increases relative to the perturbation in the baryonic component , i.e. in this case the favoured scales for the onset of perturbations are the resonant one or greater ( see fig.[fig.multzeta3 ] ) .",
    "we believe that the resonance described in sect . [ sec.res ]",
    "is responsible for setting up the growth , at the recombination epoch , of massive structures at the galactic scale .",
    "the resonance therefore provides the mechanism to select out this particular scale , among all possible scales which could undergo the gravitational collapse . in other words",
    "this resonance provides an explanation why do galaxies , with the typical masses one observes , form around the recombination epoch , even if the jeans mass for baryons , and even the jeans mass for the mixture , either before or just after this epoch , is either much larger or smaller than typical galactic masses .",
    "the typical galactic masses should , according to this work , correspond to the mass of the perturbations , which , at the recombination epoch , would have a scale near the above mentioned resonant scale .",
    "one would therefore have no need to assume that the mass spectrum of perturbations at that time was already populated in a way similar to the one we observe now .",
    "instead , one can say that the typical galactic mass scale would simply result from the scale selected by this resonance .    of course we need a better and deeper understanding of the physics of the resonant mechanism and how it can affect the power spectrum of the density perturbations , not only at recombination epoch but also in the period following it .",
    "therefore one has to go from separate fourier amplitudes to quantities _ integrated _ over the wavelength scale .",
    "since one is interested in knowing how the spectrum of inhomogeneities will transform after recombination , one must follow the dynamics of several fourier components of the density perturbations from recombination until the epoch when the perturbations become non linear .",
    "note that in the matter dominated period , before recombination , no resonance can exist .",
    "this is because , due to the coupling between baryonic matter and radiation in that period , the component with greater sound speed is the baryonic one . on the other hand , in a flat universe like the one we have assumed , the baryons are not gravitationally dominant .",
    "therefore one can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq.19-f ] ) that the resonance can not occur in that period .",
    "thus , in order to have a detailed understanding of galaxy formation one only needs to study the dynamics of the fourier components after recombination epoch . before recombination",
    "one can assume that the power spectrum was any reasonable one predicted by another model , like , for instance , some type of inflationary model .    since this is a very important point which must be carefully analysed .",
    "since it lies out of the main goal of this paper , we intend to treat it thoroughly in a separate paper .",
    "one can relate the scale of the resonance with the mass of the dark matter particle .",
    "the scale at which the resonance peak occurs depends on @xmath269 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq.102 ] ) , which in turn is a function of the value of the mass of dark matter particles @xmath285 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq.19-f ] ) we have already concluded that in order for the resonance to occur , the dark matter must necessarily be hot .",
    "the total mass @xmath6 inside a spherical region of radius @xmath286 is given by    @xmath287    where @xmath0 is the wave number and @xmath288 is the total mean density in that region .",
    "in order to obtain bounds for the mass of dark matter particles we shall assume that galaxies form by means of the above described resonance and therefore have mass scales which correspond to the resonant scale for @xmath217 .",

    "the sound speeds @xmath293 at recombination , appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq.102 ] ) are given by eq .",
    "( [ eq.13 ] ) .",
    "one should emphasize that from the decoupling , between the neutrino - like particles and radiation , until the epoch at which these particles become non - relativistic , which for @xmath294ev occurs at a red - shift @xmath51 , ( doroshkevich et al .",
    "1988 ) , their temperature t@xmath52 is given by t@xmath53t@xmath54 , where t@xmath54 is the radiation temperature .",
    "since then , it decays with @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the scale factor of the universe ( gao & ruffini 1981 ; padmanabhan 1993 ) .",
    "one can therefore estimate that , at recombination , such a dark component @xmath12 will have a temperature t@xmath295k .    in fig .",
    "[ fig.md ] is plotted the scale @xmath6 at which the resonant peak occurs ( which we have assumed to be the galactic total mass ) versus the mass of hot dark matter particles @xmath285 .    assuming that a typical galaxy formed at recombination epoch has a baryonic mass of",
    "a few @xmath296m@xmath8 one can estimate from the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig.md ] that the mass of the dark matter particles is of the order of @xmath297 .",
    "it is remarkable that this value agrees quite well with the cosmological upper bounds for neutrino s masses ( peebles 1993 ) as well as the values predicted by sciama s decaying dark matter hypothesis ( sciama 1990a ; sciama 1990b ) .",
    "it is clear from the results obtained in this work that it is incorrect to use the jeans criterion for a 1-component fluid to a 2-component mixture , for two main reasons :    1 .   the jeans scale for the mixture does not correspond to any of the jeans scales for the components taken separately .",
    "moreover , in a 2-component mixture there are always present , at all scales , oscillations in the two components , which correspond to acoustic waves .",
    "the same is not true for a one component system .",
    "however the main result of this work is , as we have shown , that , in a two - component fluid , a resonance between the two components of the fluid must always occur provided that the component with a greater density is the one with a greater sound speed , see eq .",
    "( [ eq.19-f ] ) .",
    "one can therefore put some constraints on the nature of the dark matter if galaxies are to be formed by such a resonant effect .",
    "in fact , assuming that the density parameter of the universe is @xmath298 and adopting a value for the density of the baryonic component in agreement with standard light - element nucleosynthesis , one is led to the conclusion that the universe is dominated by dark matter , i.e. @xmath234 . in such a case , if @xmath299 ( case of cdm ) , one concludes from eq .",
    "( [ eq.19-f ] ) that no resonance between the two components is possible and therefore , the galactic scale would not be a preferred one , as it seems to be .",
    "one is therefore led to believe that most , if not all , of the _ dark matter present in the universe is hot _ ,",
    "i.e. it is constituted by light neutrino - like particles as implied by the condition for the existence of a strong resonance , i.e. @xmath292 , ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq.104 ] ) and comments following it ) .",
    "this resonance is linked to the fact that at the critical scale @xmath300 , there is an enhancement of the number of particles in both components , ( but particularly in the baryonic one ) , which participate in the collapse mode , instead of participating in the acoustic modes as it happens for other scales .",
    "this effect is only significant in a narrow resonant band in the length , or mass , scale of the perturbations .",
    "this , we believe , is the reason for the formation of galactic structures at the time of recombination with their characteristic range of mass scales .",
    "this effect occurs at the galactic scales provided that the dark matter component is made of neutrino - like particles with masses of the order of @xmath301ev .",
    "this value for the mass of the neutrino - like particles is below the upper bounds imposed by cosmological constraints on the neutrino s mass ( peebles 1993 ) , assuming a flat universe , and remarkably close to the value predicted by sciama s decaying dark matter hypothesis ( sciama 1990a ; sciama 1990b ) .",
    "we must also note that , from the numerical results obtained in the preceding sections , this mass scale is of the order of @xmath302m@xmath8 which gives a baryonic mass , in the same scalelength , of the order of @xmath303m@xmath8 , which lies in the range of the masses of typical galaxies ( a few @xmath10m@xmath8 ) .",
    "one should point out , however , that the resonant scale @xmath300 is particularly sensitive to the mass of the particles constituting the dark component , see fig .",
    "[ fig.md ] .",
    "this study has left a lot of open questions , some of which are already under investigation .",
    "below we briefly comment on some of them .",
    "first : one should point out that this study assumes galaxies to have started their formation during recombination .",
    "however , this can well be not the case and they could have started their formation over a wider time interval starting from recombination . in that case , the unperturbed densities @xmath27 and the sound speeds @xmath41 in the two components would vary during such a period , allowing the scale of the resonance to be shifted .",
    "this might in turn provide an explanation for the observed wide mass range for galactic structures .",
    "this is a problem which we intend to address in a future paper ( in preparation ) , where the effects due to the expansion of the universe are taken into account .",
    "second : although the analysis of possible effects of this resonant mechanism on the power spectrum is out of the main purpose of this paper , the existence of the above mentioned resonance , or at least the change in behaviour of the mode amplitudes near the resonant scale is , on its own , a very important result .",
    "the occurrence of this resonance can have , in principle , important implications in the process of galaxy formation , and , in particular , transform the power spectrum of density perturbations at recombination epochs . therefore , though a better understanding of the physics underlying the resonant mechanism is needed , this point shall be thoroughly treated in a forthcoming paper of ours .",
    "third : one must note that it will be interesting to study what happens for the case of a 3-component system like the dark matter mixed models .",
    "we suspect that in such a case more than one structure formation resonance occurs .",
    "this is a question which we intend to address in the future .",
    "finally , one should also mention that although resonances between periodic coupled oscillators are common in all branches of physics , this type of resonance occurring in ( non periodic ) collapsing modes are , to our knowledge , yet unheard of , and we suspect that in other branches of physics such as in plasmas ( where one has a 2-component fluid whose components are coupled by the electromagnetic interaction ) similar resonances may perhaps occur , giving rise to instabilities .",
