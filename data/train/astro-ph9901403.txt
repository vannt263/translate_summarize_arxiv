    "the relative abundances of the light elements not only substantiate the standard interpretation for big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) ( reeves et al . 1973 ; epstein , lattimer , & schramm 1976 ) , but they also hold the key for our determining the universal ratio of baryons to photons , commonly designated by the parameter @xmath10 ( boesgaard & steigman 1985 ; olive et al .",
    "1990 ; smith , kawano , & malaney 1993 ) .",
    "there has been considerable interest in measuring the abundance of deuterium , since its production was strongly regulated by photodestruction in the radiation bath during the bbn , making d / h a strong discriminant of @xmath10 .",
    "deuterium is also destroyed in stars . after having passed through one or more generations of stars , diffuse gases that we can observe",
    "have probably had their deuterium abundances reduced to values below those that result from bbn .",
    "thus it is important to observe systems that have different levels of chemical enrichment and mixing ( timmes et al .",
    "1997 ) , so that we can untangle the effects of the two fundamental destruction mechanisms , i.e. , the photodestruction accompanying bbn and the astration of material as the universe matures . a key step in this area of research is to form a solid foundation of measurements of d in the chemically evolved gas in the disk of our galaxy . ultimately , when these results are combined with determinations for distant gas systems that have not aged as much , we expect to achieve a better understanding about the processing of gas through stars , which is interesting in its own right ( steigman & tosi 1992 , 1995 ; dearborn , steigman , & tosi 1996 ; scully et al .",
    "1997 ; tosi et al .",
    "1998 ) , and this in turn should allow us to extrapolate the concentration of d back to an era very soon after its primordial production .",
    "an important foundation in recognizing the relationship between d / h and some measure of stellar processing , such as the relative abundances of elements produced in stellar interiors , is that an empirical relationship between the two forms a unique sequence . if this turns out not to be true , then more elaborate interpretations of chemical evolution may be needed . to explore this issue ,",
    "we have embarked on a program to revisit some lines of sight studied by other investigators (  [ bkgnd ] ) , but this time using much higher resolution spectra obtained with the interstellar medium absorption profile spectrograph ( imaps ) .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the spectrum of @xmath1  ori  a ( hd 36486 ) .",
    "this star has a spectral classification of o9.5  ii , is a spectroscopic binary , and is a member of the ori ob1 association that has a distance modulus of 8.5 ( @xmath11 ) ( humphreys 1978 ) . in a companion paper ( sonneborn et al .",
    "1999 ) we will report on results for @xmath12  vel and @xmath13  pup . the basic properties of our spectrum of @xmath1  ori and the instrument that recorded it are discussed in  [ basic ] , followed by examinations of systematic errors that could arise in the determination of a very weak contamination signal (  [ contam ] ) , the intensity of the scattered light background (  [ bkg ] ) , and absorption features from other species (  [ interference ] ) . in  [ template ] we describe how we obtained independent information on the shape of the velocity profile for material toward @xmath1  ori , so that we could undertake our study with only a small number of unknown , free parameters .",
    "we have paid considerable attention to minimizing the errors and evaluating them in a fair and consistent manner (  [ errors ] ) . for our value of @xmath8(d",
    "i ) reported in  [ n(di ) ] to be useful , we must compare it with @xmath8(h  i ) , and we must strive to make the accuracy of the latter as good as or better than the former . in ",
    "[ n(hi ) ] we discuss our comprehensive investigation of the iue archival data that show l@xmath5 absorption in the spectrum of @xmath1  ori . this special analysis combined with our determination of @xmath8(d  i ) ultimately led to our determination of the atomic d / h toward @xmath1  ori reported in  [ d / h ] .",
    "we relate this result to the abundances of other elements relative to h in  [ heavy ] and discuss its significance in  [ disc ] .",
    "early measurements of d / h obtained from the _ copernicus _ satellite ( resolution @xmath14 fwhm ) and iue ( resolution @xmath15 fwhm ) , summarized by vidal - madjar & gry ( 1984 ) , had a few cases that differed by more than the reported errors from a general average @xmath16 . at face value , this suggested that d / h varies from one location to the next .",
    "mccullough ( 1992 ) revisited this problem and asserted that the evidence for such variations was not convincing . in making his claim that all of the data were consistent with a constant value for d / h , mccullough rejected all of the deviant cases on the grounds that the complexity of their velocity structures made the measurements much less accurate than originally claimed .    the high resolution ( @xmath17 fwhm ) and good sensitivity of the ghrs instrument on hst enabled an accumulation of very accurate observations of the interstellar l@xmath5 h and d absorption features superposed on the broader chromospheric l@xmath5 emission lines of nearby f , g and k type stars .",
    "the best determinations of d / h were those toward @xmath5  aur ( capella ) , where linsky , et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found that @xmath18 , and toward hr 1099 , where piskunov , et al .",
    "( 1997 ) obtained @xmath19 .",
    "the issue of whether or not atomic deuterium to hydrogen ratios toward other cool stars differ from these values has been an elusive one , although it seems clear that one could rule out deviations greater than about 50% in either direction ( wood , alexander , & linsky 1996 ; dring et al .",
    "1997 ; piskunov et al .",
    "the chief problem has been that the measurements of @xmath20 toward late - type stars were very dependent on assumptions about the shape of the underlying emission profile ( linsky & wood 1996 ; piskunov et al .",
    "1997 ) or the compensations for additional , broad absorptions caused by hydrogen walls associated with the stellar wind cavities around either the sun or the target stars ( linsky & wood 1996 ; wood & linsky 1998 ) .",
    "even so , these investigations revealed some intriguing , convincing variations for the abundances of d  i with respect to those of mg  ii .",
    "unfortunately , the significance of these changes is clouded by the possibility that they could result simply from alterations in the amount of depletion of mg onto dust grains ( murray et al .",

    "lemoine , et al ( 1996 ) observed the interstellar h and d l@xmath5 absorption features in the spectrum of the da white dwarf g191@xmath21b2b with the ghrs and reported their determinations for d / h .",
    "later , high - resolution observations by vidal - madjar , et al ( 1998 ) brought forth some refinements in the interpretation of the velocity structures of the absorption profiles , leading to a determination @xmath22 for all of the material in front of this star .",
    "if one allows for the fact that a contribution from the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) is somewhat blended with those of more distant clouds and adopts the @xmath5  aur result for the lic , d / h toward the other material could be of order @xmath23 .",

    ", there is the danger that improper allowances for either l@xmath5 emission ( cool stars ) or absorption ( hot dwarfs ) could lead to errors .",
    "moreover , in some circumstances hydrogen walls associated with either the target stars or the sun can lead to complications .",
    "one way to bypass these problems is to examine the higher lyman series absorption features toward more distant , early - type stars with much more foreground material , as was done with the _ copernicus _ satellite .",
    "we also have the benefit of sampling the interstellar medium well outside our immediate vicinity .",

    "a far - uv spectrum of @xmath1  ori over the wavelength interval 930 to 1150  was recorded in a series of exposures lasting 54 min over various observing intervals between 22 november and 3 december 1996 by the interstellar medium absorption profile spectrograph ( imaps ) .",
    "this series of observations was undertaken during the orfeus - spas  ii mission ( hurwitz et al . 1998 ) on sts-80 , which was the second orbital flight of imaps .",
    "imaps is a simple , objective - grating echelle spectrograph that can record the far - uv spectrum of a bright , early - type star with sufficient resolution to show many of the velocity structures in the interstellar lines .",
    "jenkins , et al .",
    "( 1996 ) present a detailed description of the imaps instrument , its performance on the first orfeus - spas mission in 1993 , and the methods of data correction and analysis .",
    "we summarize very briefly how the spectra are recorded by imaps : in any single exposure that covers an angle @xmath27 , one - quarter of the echelle grating s free spectral range and , nominally , diffraction orders 194 through 242 are recorded by an electron - bombarded ccd image sensor .",
    "this detector has an opaque photocathode on a smooth substrate and uses magnetic focusing to form the electron image on the ccd .",
    "electrons impacting on the back side of the specially thinned ccd have an energy of 18  kev , and they produce enough secondary electrons within the silicon layer to make individual photoevents appear as bright spots .",
    "each spot has an amplitude that is about 20 times greater than the combined noise from the readout amplifier and the random fluctuations in dark current .",
    "the ccd has a format of @xmath28 pixels , each of which is @xmath29 m square and subtends a @xmath30 equivalent to a doppler shift of @xmath31 .",
    "the echelle orders are separated by about 5 ccd pixels , but they are rather broad in the cross - dispersion direction . the ccd is read out 15 times a second .",
    "the video signals from successive frames are summed in an accumulating memory to produce the integrated spectral images . in our processing of these images after the flight , we subtracted dark - current comparison frames that were recorded at frequent intervals with the accelerating high voltage turned off .",
    "the effective area of imaps on the 1996 flight was about @xmath32 at wavelengths longward of about 1020 , leading to typical signal - to - noise ratios of about 80 near the maximum of the echelle grating s blaze angle for stars as bright as @xmath1  ori  a. however the al+lif coatings on the two gratings have a low reflection efficiency at shorter wavelengths , resulting in a factor of 10 lower effective area in the vicinity of the l@xmath1 and l@xmath2 lines . this reduced efficiency coupled with the much lower flux at the centers of the stellar lyman series lines made it especially difficult to achieve high values of signal - to - noise .",
    "we overcame this problem by recording a large number of spectra that could be added together . the total integrated flux at the continuum levels near l@xmath1 and l@xmath2 amounted to about 600 photons for each ccd pixel width in the dispersion direction ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "noise fluctuations in the spectra had @xmath34 deviations about equal to 1/10 of the continuum levels , with the principal noise source being the multiple readouts of the ccd , rather than from photon - counting statistical errors .",
    "( this is clearly evident in fig .",
    "[ dorideut ] , which shows a noise level at zero intensity to be about the same as that at the elevated intensity levels . )",
    "we deliberately introduced offsets in position for the spectra in different sets of exposures .",
    "this was done to reduce the possibility that the spectrum could be perturbed by subtle flaws , such as ccd columns with anomalous responses or variations in photocathode efficiency with position ( we could see no evidence for the latter however ) .",
    "figure  [ dorideut ] shows the d and h absorption profiles for @xmath1  ori at l@xmath1 and l@xmath2 .",
    "observations of telluric atomic oxygen lines from excited fine - structure levels , seen elsewhere in the imaps spectrum of this star , indicated that the instrumental profile that governs the wavelength resolution of these observations was consistent with a gaussian distribution having a fwhm  ori  a are not far from those that apply to our @xmath1  ori spectrum . ]",
    "equal to @xmath35 . at this",
    "resolving power , the deuterium features are well separated from their hydrogen counterparts , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ dorideut ] .",
    "while the deuterium l@xmath1 profile does show some asymmetry , to within the uncertainties of the noise there does not seem to be any extraordinary complexity in the velocity structure of the d profiles .",
    "for instance , there seems to be no evidence for any strong , narrow velocity components buried within the main peak of the l@xmath2 feature .",
    "most important , the d features are not badly saturated .      there is some overlap of signal from one echelle diffraction order to the next .",
    "our optimal extraction routine was designed to compensate for this effect ( jenkins et al .",
    "1996 ) , but if this correction was not perfect we may have had some contamination by the spectral intensities from an adjacent order .",
    "we had to be especially watchful for this possibility in the vicinity of the lyman series lines because the stellar continuum level in the region of interest is much lower than elsewhere .",
    "this gives the contamination signal an advantage over the signal we wished to study .",
    "for l@xmath2 there is no problem because there are no spectral features in the orders either directly above or below the d and h features or their nearby continua .",
    "errors in correcting for order overlap will only change the effective zero intensity level , which is corrected out anyway .",
    "the next higher order of diffraction that appears just below the one that contains the l@xmath1 absorptions is featureless , but , unfortunately , the order above the l@xmath1 order exhibits interstellar absorption features from the very strong multiplet of n  i at 954 .    in our investigation of the spectrum in the vicinity of l@xmath1 , we allowed for the possibility that our correction for the order overlap was either too large or too small .",
    "this error could have added a spurious signal to our spectrum .",
    "therefore , we included as a free parameter a scaling coefficient @xmath36 ( which could be either positive or negative ) for the amplitude of a correction signal ( with the same shape ) to cancel the possible residual contamination , and we allowed it to vary as we explored for minimum values of @xmath3 (    [ errors ] and [ n(di ) ] ) .",
    "when this coefficient is less than 0.005 or larger than 0.03 , unreasonably large perturbations can be seen in the bottom of the very broad hydrogen feature . within this range , however , we allowed for the fact that our derivation of @xmath8(d  i ) could be influenced by the exact value .",
    "figure  [ dorideut ] shows the correction signal with the most plausible amplitude , as indicated by minimum @xmath3 for @xmath36 at the most probable @xmath8(d  i ) given in table  [ chi2_results ] .",
    "the spectrum that is shown in this figure has had this correction included .",
    "our analysis of the d profiles is very dependent on our having an accurate determination of the level of zero intensity .",
    "sources of background illumination include not only grating scatter , but also a diffuse glow caused by a portion of the l@xmath5 geocoronal background that is not fully rejected by a mechanical collimator at the instrument s entrance aperture .",
    "( the detector s dark count rate is negligible compared to these sources of background . ) fortunately , we could use the bottoms of the broad , heavily saturated h absorptions that accompany each d profile establish the position of the background level .    in principle , the saturated portion of the h profile could mislead us if there were broad , shallow wings in the instrumental profile caused by scattering from the echelle grating .",
    "if this were the case , one could imagine that the local background level might increase slightly for wavelengths somewhat removed from the strong h feature .",
    "we can rule out this prospect on two grounds .",
    "first , before imaps was flown , we illuminated it in a vacuum tank with a collimated beam from a molecular hydrogen emission line source , and faint , very broad wings of the recorded emission lines could be seen only on the strongest features .",
    "the energy in these wings corresponded to 15% of the total , spread over several  .",
    "the remaining 85% was within the main peak .",
    "second , for @xmath1  ori we found that for both l@xmath1 and l@xmath2 the apparent depths of the d features in _ copernicus _ scans ( taken with an ordinary grating in first order ) showed excellent agreement with those registered in the imaps spectrum after it had been degraded by convolving it with the _ copernicus _ instrumental profile function [ a triangle with fwhm = 0.045   ( laurent , vidal - madjar , & york 1979 ) ] .",
    "for these two reasons , we feel confident that the apparent flux in the bottom of the h feature is , to within the uncertainties from noise , a good representation for the zero level under the deuterium line .",
    "table  [ other_lines ] lists lines from species other than d  i and h  i that are in vicinity of the deuterium absorptions or the fragments of the spectrum that were used to define the continuum level (  [ n(di ) ] ) . the werner 3@xmath210",

    "the 1081.875  line has @xmath41 that is 0.82 times that of the interfering feature ( morton 1991 ) , and once again this difference was taken into account when we made the correction .",
    "to derive the most accurate value for the column density of atomic deuterium @xmath8(d  i ) , it is beneficial to use information from other species recorded at much higher s / n to help define more accurately the shape of the d  i velocity profile . profiles of o  i and n  i are probably the most suitable comparison examples for two reasons . first , these two elements have very mild depletions , if any , caused by the atoms condensing into solid form onto dust grains ( meyer , cardelli , & sofia 1997 ; meyer , jura , & cardelli 1998 ) .",
    "the column densities of n and o seem to track those of h over a diverse sample of regions ( ferlet 1981 ; york et al .",
    "1983 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "it is unlikely that their velocity profiles will differ appreciably from that of d  i. this is in contrast to the usual striking differences exhibited between elements that are mildly depleted , such as na  i , and elements that are strongly depleted , such as ca  ii .",
    "the former is generally concentrated at lower velocities than the latter for a given line of sight ( routly & spitzer 1952 ; siluk & silk 1974 ; vallerga et al . 1993 ; sembach & danks 1994 ) .",
    "second , o  i and n  i have ionization potentials close to that of neutral hydrogen , and this close match in energy makes their susceptibility to ionization nearly the same and also insures that the cross sections for ( nearly resonant ) charge exchange are high ( field & steigman 1971 ; butler & dalgarno 1979 ) .",
    "for this reason , plus the consideration that whatever means there are for ionizing n and o will operate in much the same way for h ( or d ) , we can generally regard the relative ionizations of oxygen and nitrogen to be good representations for that of d [ but for evidence to the contrary , see vidal - madjar et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ] .",
    "this assumes , of course , that o and n are not being ionized appreciably to multiply charged states .",
    "ori  a. no absorption was evident at @xmath44 , but it was difficult to assign a quantitative upper limit because of interference from the nearby feature of si  ii at 989.873 . ]    in the wavelength coverage of imaps where we have a reasonably good s / n , there are no transitions from the o  i ground state that are weak enough ( and with known f - values ) to yield absorption lines that we can analyze .",

    "unfortunately , the transition probability for this line is so weak that only the main peak in the velocity profile shows up above the noise .    for n  i , within the coverage of imaps there are three multiplets ( at 952.4 , 953.8  and 954.1 ) from the ground level that are ideal for studying the apparent distribution  ori at high velocity resolution , it is probably safe to assume that the two are equal to each other . ]",

    "the other two features are heavily saturated but useful for revealing the weaker shoulder on the left - hand side of the main peak . the 4 much stronger features of n  i in the vicinity of 954  are useful for defining accurately the behavior of @xmath45 at velocities where it is below about @xmath51 .",
    "we derived a composite @xmath45 profile for n  i from the 7 lines using the method employed by jenkins & peimbert ( 1997 ) when they synthesized the profiles of h@xmath38 in various @xmath37 levels toward @xmath13  ori  a.    figure  [ nando ] shows the @xmath52 profiles that we derived for n  i and o  i. we chose to work with the n  i profile in our interpretation of the d lines because it was of much better quality . this pragmatic reason for choosing n  i as",

    "while this may be true , we point out that this weak shoulder in the o  i absorption , if it exists , may have been lost in the fitting of the continuum to the curvature of the stellar spectrum , which is larger than the expected size of the shoulder indicated by the n  i profile .",
    "also , the existence of some absorption to the left of a main peak is supported by the shape of the l@xmath1 deuterium profile shown in figures [ dorideut ] and [ extremes ] .    in principle , we should be cautious about possible contamination of the interstellar n  i profile by nitrogen atoms in the earth s atmosphere above our orbital altitude of 295 km . above this altitude , the msis-86 model atmosphere for solar minimum shows an exponential decrease in the density of nitrogen atoms with a scale height of 53 km , starting at a density of @xmath54 at 295 km ( meier 1991 ) . for a zenith angle @xmath55 of 45",

    "since the convolution of two gaussian distributions produces a third with a second moment equal to the sum of the two original ones , we can state that @xmath66    when we analyzed the deuterium features , we adopted for a standard model of their shapes the nitrogen velocity profile convolved with the last term in eq .",

    "the ones that we can identify easily are the inaccuracies in defining the background level for both lines (  [ bkg ] ) and the contamination signal in the l@xmath1 profile([contam ] ) .",
    "additional parameters that could affect the outcome are the temperature of the gas @xmath67 through its effect in making the deuterium profile smoother than the n  i template (  [ template ] ) , the difference in the zero points of the n  i and d  i velocity scales , and the adopted heights and slopes of the continuum levels over the deuterium l@xmath1 and l@xmath2 absorption features .",
    "our tactic for coping with these systematic errors was to express them in terms of simple parameters that could vary and then consider them in a unified analysis .",
    "since these errors could be correlated , we felt that it would be unwise to analyze them separately .",
    "we determined how well the data conform to various combinations of parameter values by evaluating the conventional @xmath3 statistic , @xmath69 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath70 is a measured intensity with uncertainty @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the expected intensity given the specified set of parameter values .",
    "useful discussions of how to interpret the determinations of @xmath3 when there are many free parameters are given by lampton , et al .",
    "( 1976 ) and bevington & robinson ( 1992 , p. 212 ) .",
    "the basic scheme is to find the minimum value @xmath73 that arises when all parameters that influence @xmath72 are free to vary , and then examine the deviations @xmath74 as the parameters stray from their optimum values .",
    "our @xmath3 values represented a sum over both the l@xmath1 and l@xmath2 features taken together .",
    "this approach is similar to one adopted by burles & tytler ( 1998a ) in their analysis of the deuterium abundance in a quasar absorption line system , except that we decouple the hydrogen measurements (  [ n(hi ) ] ) from those of deuterium because they are fundamentally different from each other .    to limit the number of degrees of freedom that apply to the confidence intervals for the outcomes that we are interested in , we segregated the free parameters into two fundamental categories .",
    "first , we recognized those parameters that had an astrophysical significance , @xmath8(d  i ) and @xmath67 .",
    "we sought to find a confidence interval that constrained these two parameters simultaneously .",
    "while @xmath67 might seem to be an incidental parameter outside the objective of this study , there were good physical reasons for our verifying that no appreciable portion of the probability density wandered above or below acceptable limits .",
    "the second category contained parameters that were of no particular interest to us , i.e. , nuisance parameters , but ones that had to be allowed to change freely as we re - minimized the @xmath3 for every new trial combination of @xmath8(d  i ) and @xmath67 .",
    "we had no profound reason to require that any of these variables in the second category be constrained , and thus we could consider a projection of the lowest @xmath3 values in the multi - dimensional space of these variables onto just the @xmath8(d  i)@xmath75 plane .",
    "this allowed us to restrict the number of the degrees of freedom ( df ) that applied to the confidence intervals down to only 2 .    in summary , parameters that mattered were",
    "( 1 ) @xmath8(d  i ) and ( 2 ) @xmath67 , while those that did not were ( 3 ) the coefficient @xmath36 for scaling the contamination signal (  [ contam ] ) , ( 4 ) a relative velocity error @xmath76 between the n  i profile template (  [ template ] ) and the deuterium absorption , ( 5 and 6 ) the background levels in the bottom of the h l@xmath1 and l@xmath2 features , and finally ( 7 through 10 ) the two coefficients that described the continuum straight lines spanning the d l@xmath1 and l@xmath2 features , i.e. , in each case the level near the middle of the d feature and the slope of the line.(h  i ) given in  [ n(hi ) ] , the damping wing absorbs only 9% of the flux at the d l@xmath1 line and 2% at the d l@xmath2 line .",
    "moreover , the _ appearance _ of the continuum suggests that a straight - line fit is justified  see fig .",
    "[ extremes ] . ]      from our knowledge of the ccd readout noise and dark current combined with the statistical fluctuations in the ( background + signal ) photons , we made an initial estimate for the uncertainties in the individual measurements of intensity @xmath71 at each velocity .",

    "the correlations disappear for @xmath78 , which is exactly the width of each pixel in the ccd .. ] our determinations of @xmath3 discussed below relied on intensities separated by this value for @xmath79 .",
    "the most important terms in the summation for @xmath3 are those that are directly influenced by trial values of @xmath8(d  i ) and @xmath67 , through differences over the ( deuterium line ) velocity interval @xmath80 to @xmath81 between measured intensities @xmath70 and the computed values of @xmath72 , the expected absorption profile multiplied by a local continuum level . at the same time , parameters that define the continuum contribute to @xmath3 through the deviations between @xmath70 and straight - line extrapolations over the intervals ( @xmath82 to @xmath80 , + 40 to @xmath83 ) for l@xmath1 and ( @xmath84 to @xmath80 , + 40 to @xmath85 ) for l@xmath2 ( see fig  [ extremes ] ) .",
    "likewise , @xmath3 is influenced by modifications in the background zero level that must be subtracted from the raw intensities at all velocities : we allowed the sum to include deviations away from zero for the background - corrected fluxes over the heavily saturated portion of the h profile from + 60 to @xmath86 ( for the d line heliocentric velocity scales shown in figs .",
    "[ dorideut ] and [ extremes ] ) .",
    "finally , fluxes over all velocities in the l@xmath1 profile can be modified by the contamination correction signal , whose amplitude was allowed to vary as we searched for a minimum @xmath3 in each case .",
    "we had a total of 320 independent intensity measurements to constrain the 10 free parameters listed at the end of  [ errors ] , so we should insist that the minimum @xmath3 agree with a reasonable expectation for @xmath87 .",
    "in fact , with our original estimate for the noise in the measurements , we arrived at a minimum @xmath88 , a value that was unreasonably low . in later calculations , we rescaled this noise level by a factor @xmath89 , since we had a 90% confidence that the minimum @xmath3 should be at least equal to 278 for df  =  310 .",
    "we felt that it was legitimate for us to perform a _",
    "post facto _ rescaling of the noise , because our original estimate was accurate to only a level of about 25% .",
    "this rescaling is a conservative one , because it s more probable that the minimum @xmath3 should really be about equal to 310 .",
    "if we had used 310 instead of 278 in the expression for the noise multiplication factor , we accordingly would have found tighter limits for @xmath8(d  i ) because the @xmath3 expressions would have increased more rapidly as we deviated away from the most probable @xmath8(d  i ) .    to find the minimum @xmath3 , we used powell s method of converging to the minimum of a multi - dimensional function ( press et al .",
    "1992 , p. 406 ) .",
    "after finding this minimum and noting the most probable @xmath8(d  i ) , we then evaluated the confidence interval for @xmath8(d  i ) by forcing this parameter to vary , but at the same time allowing the other 9 parameters to adjust to new minima in @xmath3 .",
    "our target values for the new minima corresponded to @xmath90 and @xmath91 for the 90% and 99% confidence limits ( i.e. , `` 1.65@xmath92 '' and `` 2.58@xmath92 '' deviations ) , respectively , where @xmath93 is the overall minimum at the preferred value of @xmath8(d  i ) as shown in table  [ chi2_results ] .",

    "it is for this reason that we concluded that the l@xmath5 feature was the best indicator of @xmath8(h  i ) .",
    "spectra of @xmath1  ori obtained with the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( iue ) in high - dispersion mode ( fwhm @xmath108 25 km s@xmath109 ) were particularly attractive for our study of the l@xmath5 feature for several reasons .",

    "1973 ) , an effect that requires a special correction ( bohlin 1975 ) of uncertain accuracy .",
    "second , a large number of observations of @xmath1  ori obtained under slightly different observing conditions ( e.g. , small aperture _ vs. _ large aperture ) over the course of many years are available from the iue archive . by analyzing all of the iue exposures rather than a single observation",
    ", we can validate our estimates of random errors and also increase our chances of exposing _",
    "systematic _ errors in the derivation of @xmath8 ( ) . finally , our ability to combine many observations allowed us to reduce the effects from random noise by brute force .",
    "a potentially important source of systematic error is the fact that @xmath1  ori is a complex multiple - star system .",
    "the primary ( component a ) is a single - lined spectroscopic binary that is important in the history of ism research : stationary ca  ii absorption features in its spectrum provided the earliest evidence of interstellar gas ( hartmann 1904 ) .",
    "the velocity amplitude of the binary is @xmath110 , and it has a period of 5.7 days ( harvey et al .",
    "it is also a partially eclipsing binary ( koch & hrivnak 1981 ) , and it has a visual companion of comparable brightness at a separation of @xmath111 ( heintz 1980 ; mcalister & hendry 1982 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic binary nature of the star system presents an opportunity to investigate systematic errors in the determination of the interstellar @xmath8 ( ) : the l@xmath5 profile is extremely broad , and if there are unrecognized stellar lines in the principal part of the lorentz wings of the l@xmath5 feature , then their additional optical depth could lead to an overestimate of @xmath8 ( ) .",
    "however , such stellar lines should move in velocity as the binary traverses its orbit , and this may lead to different values of @xmath8 ( ) when observations made at different times are analyzed .",
    "if this occurs , then we should see @xmath8 ( ) change as a function of the spectroscopic binary phase .",
    "similarly , we can check for systematic changes in @xmath8 ( ) when the multiple star enters the partial eclipses over the phase intervals 0.9@xmath210.1 and 0.4@xmath210.6 . while any dependence on phase may uncover an influence that stellar features have on the outcome",
    ", there is no guarantee that they do not perturb our result in a manner that is uniform over all phases .    according to the nssdc archive ,",
    "there are 59 iue observations of @xmath1  ori obtained with the short wavelength prime ( swp ) camera in the high - dispersion echelle mode .",
    "we screened these observations for saturated exposures , missing data , or other problems and rejected two of the observations , leaving 57 spectra for our analysis . using the standard iue rdaf software , we selected the spectral regions of interest from the standard iuesips data rather than the newsips reductions since there are a number of problems with newsips processing as applied to high dispersion spectra that could adversely affect our analysis ( massa et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in the vicinity of the l@xmath5 line the orders on the iue detector are closely spaced , and scattered light from adjacent orders overlaps in the interorder region causing an incorrect background subtraction and zero intensity level when using the standard software .",
    "we used the method of bianchi & bohlin ( 1984 ) to correct for this problem .",
    "also , in some cases , a velocity shift was applied to the iue data based on the position of the triplet at 1200  compared to that expected from the imaps profile (  [ template ] ) with optical depths rescaled to account for the stronger transition probabilities .",
    "this should register all of the iue data to the correct velocity scale to an accuracy of better than @xmath1125 km s@xmath109 , which is more than adequate for a determination of @xmath8 ( ) since we are fitting _ both _ of the strong damping wings of the l@xmath5 profile ( an error of 5 km s@xmath109 in the velocity scale zero point changes @xmath8 ( ) by an insignificant amount ) .",
    "iue data contain a number of perturbations in addition to the usual photon counting noise .",
    "they show strong fixed pattern noise , `` hot spots '' which mimic emission features , and drop - outs where the reseaux used to correct for camera distortions happen to fall on the spectrum ( harris & sonneborn 1987 ) .",
    "in addition , the spectra occasionally show artifacts at the transitions between echelle orders due to errors in the ripple correction ( see below ) . again , by analyzing _",
    "all _ of the iue data , we can reduce the impact of these noise sources , which are present in some of the observations and are not apparent in others .",
    "we ascertained that there was no _ persistent _ nonlinearity in the photometric response of iue by comparing its l@xmath5 profiles of hd93521 and hd74455 with those recorded for the same stars by the ghrs on hst with the medium - resolution grating ( g160 m ) .",
    "departures from the ghrs spectra near the breaks in the iue echelle orders seem to come and go , but aside from the greater random noise in the iue spectra , the spectra are usually very similar to each other .    in simplest terms ,",
    "our means for constraining the column density followed a method introduced by jenkins ( 1971 ) and used later by bohlin ( 1975 ) , bohlin , et al ( 1978 ) , shull & van steenberg ( 1985 ) , and diplas & savage ( 1994 ) : we determined the @xmath8 ( ) that provides the best fit to the l@xmath5 profile with the optical depth @xmath113 at a given wavelength @xmath50 calculated from the expression @xmath114 ( jenkins 1971 ) , where @xmath115 is the l@xmath5 line center at the velocity centroid of the hydrogen .",
    "however , we went a step further by employing the technique used to estimate @xmath8 ( ) in  [ n(di ) ] , i.e. , we first determined the important free parameters that could be adjusted to fit the l@xmath5 absorption profile , then we found the set of parameters that minimized @xmath116 using powell s method , and finally we set confidence limits on the column density by increasing ( or decreasing ) @xmath8 ( ) with the other parameters freely varying until @xmath116 increased by the appropriate amount for the confidence limit of interest .",
    "figure  [ hicon ] shows a sample iue spectrum in the vicinity of the l@xmath5 absorption line . from this figure",
    "one can see that the continuum is close to linear in this region . however , it is possible that the continuum has a slight downward or upward curvature , so we assumed a second - order polynomial to describe the continuum and allowed the @xmath116 minimization process to determine the continuum shape that provided the best fit to the l@xmath5 profile .",
    "therefore the free parameters for fitting the profile were @xmath8 ( ) , three coefficients that specify the second - order continuum polynomial , and a simple additive correction to the intensity zero point .",
    "profile showed that the zero intensity level was not quite correct , so we included a zero point shift as a free parameter and used intensity points within the saturated core as one of the collections of terms for calculating @xmath116 . ]",
    "we point out that the continuum placement is constrained not only by the fits to regions that are far removed from the l@xmath5 feature , but also by requiring a good match to the shapes of its damping wings .",
    "for instance , if the continuum is badly placed or has too much upward or downward curvature , then a poor fit results . in particular , if we artificially forced the continuum to have a downward curvature ( in an experimental challenge to lower @xmath8(h  i ) and thus provide a higher d / h ) , we obtained clearly inferior fits .",
    "we found that in the course of our minimizing @xmath3 that we could always simultaneously obtain a good fit to the profile and match the outlying fluxes with a nearly flat continuum .",
    "figure  [ hiprofs ] shows two examples of l@xmath5 profiles observed with iue , along with the computed profiles for the lower and upper bounds on @xmath8 ( ) at the 90% confidence level for each case .",
    "the final continua corresponding to the upper and lower bounds are plotted with dashed lines .",
    "panel ( @xmath117 ) shows a typical spectrum , while ( @xmath118 ) shows examples of artifacts at @xmath119 1214.4 and 1224.8  that we encountered at the transitions between iue echelle orders .",
    "assuming these to be artifacts due to the ripple correction , we used only the sides of the l@xmath5 profile in the wavelength ranges 1209.0@xmath211213.5  and 1217.14@xmath211223.0  and thereby excluded these artifacts from the @xmath120 calculation .",

    "it is important to note that the great strength of the l@xmath5 profile makes the lorentzian wings dominate over the effects of instrumental or doppler broadening .",
    "gas that is known to exist in the vicinity of the orion association at high velocities ( @xmath122 ) ( cowie , songaila , & york 1979 ) should not be important , since the absorptions from any wisps of h  i at such velocities are displaced by only about 0.3  relative to the line center .",
    "figure  [ allhi ] shows the logarithms of the derived column densities with their 1@xmath92 error bars , plotted as a function of the spectroscopic binary phase , for all of the iue swp data except the two rejected exposures .",

    "we find that including the region that spans the ripple correction artifact at 1214.4  shown in figure  [ hiprofs](b ) lowers the overall result by less than 0.01  dex .",
    "this is because the feature is present in only a small fraction of the iue spectra .",

    ", we arrive at @xmath144 .",
    "thus , we see no evidence that the gas has been specially enriched with material having a high abundance of heavy elements and , by virtue of a more intensive exposure to stellar interiors , a more thorough depletion of deuterium .",
    "in fact , the possible positive correspondence in the deviations in the n and d abundances is reminiscent of the suggested correlation ( but with large errors ) between d / h and zn / h shown by york & jura ( 1982 ) . of course",
    ", we must acknowledge that for nitrogen a comparison of our result for @xmath1  ori with the general measurements of meyer , et al ( 1997 ) for other lines of sight may be compromised by errors in f values , since we used different transitions to determine @xmath145 .",
    "our finding presented in  [ d / h ] indicates that the most probable d / h toward @xmath1  ori is about half as large as that found from various hst investigations of the local ism .",
    "our result applies to an average over a range of velocities , which means that it represents a _",
    "lower limit _ for the magnitude of deviations from the other cases . this anomaly is not linked with an increase in o / h or n / h , as one might expect from a simple explanation that a greater fraction of the gas had been cycled through stellar interiors . of course , it may be possible to envision that the gas toward @xmath1  ori holds an unusually large fraction of material that has cycled only through the _ outer envelopes _ of stars , thus depleting the d without increasing the concentrations of heavier elements .",
    "recent observations of hd emission in the infrared from gas near orion seem to confirm our finding that the abundance of deuterium is low in this region .",
    "wright , et al .",
    "( 1999 ) detected emission from the hd @xmath146 transition at @xmath147 toward the orion bar with the long wavelength spectrometer on board the _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) . while there are some uncertainties in the rotation temperature of hd and the correction factors that must be applied to observations of the accompanying h@xmath38 , they arrived at a preferred value @xmath148 which leads to @xmath149 since there should be no appreciable d or h in atomic form",
    ". their total range for d / h could be as large as 0.35 to @xmath150 however .",
    "bertoldi , et al .",
    "( 1999 ) used the short wavelength spectrometer on iso and found a weak emission from the @xmath151 transition at @xmath152 for hd in the orion molecular outflow omc-1 .",
    "again , corrections using information from models of the gas had to be made to interpret the results .",
    "bertoldi , et al.(1999 ) concluded that @xmath153 .",
    "the measurements of hd by both groups seem to lead to results that are consistent with our determination of atomic d / h toward @xmath1  ori  a.    very distant gas systems that are registered in quasar absorption line spectra reveal apparent values of d / h that range from @xmath154 ( burles & tytler 1998a , b ) to @xmath155 ( songaila et al .",
    "1994 ; carswell et al . 1996",

    "; webb et al . 1997 ; tytler et al . 1999 )  see reviews by burles & tytler ( 1998c ) and hogan ( 1998 ) .",
    "the large dispersion in these outcomes might be attributable either to complications that arise from our incomplete knowledge of the chemical evolution of systems at large redshifts , the difficulty in obtaining accurate values of @xmath8(h  i ) , or to the presence of random , weak , h  i systems that masquerade as deuterium by having a velocity offset that is equal to about @xmath156 from a main system .",
    "one might suppose that , in time , additional observations that include new cases or new data on existing ones may lead to a better understanding of the behavior of d / h in the universe .",
    "unfortunately , this optimistic belief may have been dealt a setback by our result that indicates that d / h could be driven by a process that we do not understand .",
    "essentially , we see evidence that the ratio changes over a distance scale where the environment should be homogeneous , according to observations of other elements and generally accepted simple models for a galaxy s chemical evolution and mixing rates in the ism .    a few proposals to explain possible deviations in the balance of atomic d to h in the interstellar medium have been considered in the past .",
    "the simplest involves the selective incorporation of d into hd , an effect that can amplify hd / h@xmath38 to values well above the fundamental ratio of d to h ( watson 1973 ) , but one that is probably counterbalanced by the more rapid photodissociation of hd in diffuse clouds because there is no self shielding ( as there often is with h@xmath38 ) .",
    "a preferential formation of hd is not responsible for the depletion of atomic d toward @xmath1  ori  a , since @xmath157 ( spitzer , cochran , & hirshfeld 1974 ) ( likewise , we see no hd features in our imaps spectrum ) .",
    "another alternative , one advanced by vidal - madjar , et al .",
    "( 1978 ) and bruston et al .",
    "( 1981 ) , makes use of the differences in the ways that d and h can respond to radiation pressure , as a result of the very different opacities in the lyman lines .",
    "they proposed that this effect could lead to a separation of the two species if there were a density gradient and a nonisotropic radiation field .",
    "finally , jura ( 1982 ) has suggested that deuterium atoms could collide with dust grains , stick to them , and then be more strongly bound than hydrogen .",
    "furthermore , he suggests that the mobility of the d atoms on the surfaces of these grains could be much lower than that of h , thus limiting the chances for combining with h atoms and being ejected as hd .",
    "one possible way to investigate the plausibility of this hypothesis might be to look for d@xmath21c or d@xmath21o stretch mode absorption features in dense clouds .",
    "we look forward to the possibility that insights on the relationship for the variability in d / h to other interstellar parameters could arise from the anticipated large increase of information that should come from the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
