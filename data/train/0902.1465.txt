    "the in - degree and out - degree may be correlated ; this correlation can be characterized by @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the average of the indicated quantity over all network nodes .",
    "( since every out - link of a node is an in - link for some other node , @xmath16 . )",
    "additionally , networks can be assortative or disassortative @xcite , i.e. , nodes with high degree may prefer or avoid connecting to other nodes of high degree .",
    "we characterize this by a correlation coefficient @xmath17 between the in - degrees @xmath18 and the out - degrees @xmath13 at either end of a directed link from node @xmath5 to node @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath19 where @xmath20 indicates an average over all network links .",
    "if @xmath21 , the network is assortative , if @xmath22 it is disassortative , and it is neutral if @xmath17 is exactly one .",
    "another example of topological structure is the existence of communities @xcite , which are groups of nodes that tend to be densely interconnected within the group but sparsely connected between groups .",
    "in addition to static topological properties of networks , another area of recent interest has been dynamical processes taking place on networks .",
    "examples include synchronization of coupled identical dynamical systems ( which may be chaotic ) @xcite , the onset of coherence in the evolution of heterogeneous network - coupled dynamical systems ( both oscillatory @xcite , as well as chaotic @xcite ) , the onset of instability in discrete state models of gene networks @xcite , percolation on directed networks @xcite , and others . in several of these examples @xcite ,",
    "an important determining quantity was shown to be the maximum eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix @xmath1 , the elements of which are defined to be @xmath2 if there is a directed link to node @xmath4 from node @xmath5 and zero otherwise for all @xmath4 , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the number of network nodes ; @xmath25 by definition .    motivated by the importance of @xmath0 to these dynamical problems , ref .",
    "@xcite developed theory for obtaining large @xmath24 approximations to @xmath0 from knowledge of statistical characterizations of the network .",
    "for example , it was shown @xcite that random networks constrained only by specification of the joint degree distribution @xmath26 have @xmath27 where @xmath26 is the probability that a randomly chosen node has in - degree @xmath28 and out - degree @xmath29 . from it",

    "thus assortativity ( @xmath21 ) tends to increases @xmath0 , and disassortativity ( @xmath22 ) tends to decrease @xmath0 .",
    "however , we note that in two of the cited applications ( namely , gene network stability @xcite and site percolation on large directed networks @xcite ) , the formulations resulted in a somewhat more general eigenvalue problem .",
    "specifically , this problem was that of determining the largest eigenvalue @xmath6of a generalized adjacency matrix @xmath7 whose elements are given by @xmath32 where @xmath9is the ` bias ' characterizing node @xmath4 which may be different for each node . in the special case of uniform @xmath33 for all @xmath4 , the problem for @xmath6reduces to that for @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath34 , and the previous results such as eqs . and can be employed .",
    "however , it is also of interest to consider the more general problem of determining @xmath6for nonuniform biases , and it is that problem to which this paper is devoted .",
    "we note that in the site percolation context @xcite , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the probability that node @xmath4 is removed , while in the gene network context @xcite , @xmath37 is the probability that the output of gene ( node ) @xmath4 is switched to another state if one or more of its randomly chosen inputs is switched . in either case ,",

    "we furthermore assume that @xmath81 and @xmath82 on the two ends of a link from @xmath5 to @xmath4 are uncorrelated .",
    "thus there is no assortativity , and @xmath83 does not depend on @xmath61 . under this assumption , @xmath83 is simply the probability that a randomly chosen link points toward a node with degree @xmath58 .",
