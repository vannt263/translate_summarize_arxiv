    "<S> _ ab initio _ calculations of the harmonic phonon dispersion curves and phonon mode grneisen parameters have become routine .    </S>",
    "<S> a systematic approach to _ anharmonicity _ has been more difficult to develop . </S>",
    "<S> anharmonic effects are key to explaining phenomena where phonon - phonon collisions become important , such as in the study of lattice thermal conductivity , @xmath0 , a key quantity for optimizing the performance of electronic materials , thermal coatings , and thermoelectrics @xcite . for weakly anharmonic systems , </S>",

    "<S> their effects on phonon frequencies and lifetimes can be evaluated using the first - order perturbation theory ( pt ) @xcite , and @xmath0 can then be obtained by either using the relaxation time approximation or solving the boltzmann transport equation @xcite . the computational feasibility and physical accuracy of these methods are well established @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , pt tends to be computationally expensive for solids with large , complex unit cells , and its ability to handle strong anharmonicity is insufficient , especially when the harmonic phonon dispersion contains imaginary frequencies or when phonon scattering becomes so intense that @xmath0 saturates at its theoretical minimum @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> our approach , compressive sensing lattice dynamics ( csld ) , determines anharmonic force constants from standard dft total energy calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we utilize compressive sensing ( cs ) , a technique recently developed in the field of information science for recovering sparse solutions from incomplete data @xcite , to determine which anharmonic terms are important and find their values simultaneously . a non - intuitive prescription based on cs to generate dft training data </S>",
    "<S> is given . </S>",
    "<S> we show that csld is efficient , general and robust through a few prototypical case studies . </S>",

    "<S> since it is not _ a priori _ obvious where to truncate this expansion , one needs to rely on physical intuition , which can only be gained on a case - by - case basis through time - consuming cycles of model construction and cross - validation . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , anharmonic fcts have been calculated only for relatively simple crystals and weak anharmonicity @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we have recently shown that a similar problem in alloy theory , the cluster expansion ( ce ) method for configurational energetics @xcite , can be solved efficiently and accurately using compressive sensing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cs has revolutionized information science by providing a mathematically rigorous recipe for reconstructing @xmath17-sparse models ( i.e. , models with @xmath17 nonzero coefficients out of a large pool of possibles , @xmath18 , when @xmath19 ) from a set of only @xmath20 data points @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> given training data , cs automatically picks out the relevant expansion coefficients and determines their values _ in one shot _ by applying a mathematical technique which in essence is the occam s razor for model choice . to see how this applies to lattice dynamics , we write down the force - displacement relationship for eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : taylor ] ) : @xmath21 the forces can be obtained from first - principles calculations using any general - purpose dft code for a set of @xmath22 atomic configurations in a supercell . </S>",
    "<S> this establishes a linear problem @xmath23 for the unknown fcts , where @xmath24 will be referred to as the sensing matrix . </S>",

    "<S> different training configurations are labeled by superscript @xmath25 . </S>",

    "<S> columns corresponds to @xmath18 fct components , which are arranged in a vector @xmath28 . in practice </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath18 can far exceed @xmath29 , which makes the linear problem eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : feqaphi ] ) underdetermined . </S>",
    "<S> a reasonable approach would be to choose @xmath28 so that it reproduces the training data @xmath30 to a given accuracy with the smallest number of nonzero fct components , i.e. , by minimizing the so - called @xmath31 norm of the solution . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , this is an intractable ( `` np - hard '' ) discrete optimization problem .    </S>",
    "<S> cs solves the underdetermined linear problem in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : feqaphi ] ) by minimizing the @xmath32 norm of the coefficients , @xmath33 , while requiring a certain level of accuracy for reproducing the data . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath32 norm serves as an approximation to the @xmath31 norm and results in a computationally tractable convex optimization problem . </S>",
    "<S> mathematically , the solution is found as @xmath34 where the second term is the usual sum - of - squares euclidian @xmath35 norm of the fitting error for the training data ( in this case , dft forces ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath32 term drives the model towards solutions with a small number of nonzero elements , and the parameter @xmath36 is used to adjust the relative weights of the @xmath32 and @xmath35 terms ( see below ) . </S>",
    "<S> csld has several advantages over other methods for building models of lattice dynamics : it does not require prior physical intuition to pick out potentially relevant fcts , the fitting procedure is very robust with respect to both random and systematic noise @xcite , and it gives an efficient prescription for generating training data .    </S>",
    "<S> a full account of the technical details of our approach will be given in a separate publication , and here we only describe the key features . </S>",
    "<S> higher values of @xmath36 will produce a least - squares like fitting at the expense of denser fcts that are prone to over - fitting , while small @xmath36 will produce very sparse under - fitted fcts , degrading the quality of the fit . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal @xmath36 value that produces a model with the highest predictive accuracy lies in - between and can be determined by monitoring the predictive error for a leave - out subset of the training data not used in fitting @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the predictive accuracy of the resulting model is then validated on a third , distinct set of dft data , which we refer to as the `` prediction set '' . space group symmetry and translational invariance conditions are used to reduce the number of independent fct elements @xcite ; the latter are also important for momentum conservation according to the noether s theorem . </S>",
    "<S> these linear constraints are applied algebraically by constructing a null - space matrix . for polar insulators , </S>",
    "<S> the long - range coulomb interactions can be treated separately by calculating the born effective charges and dielectric tensors . </S>",
    "<S> the long - range contributions are then subtracted from @xmath30 , ensuring that the remaining fcts are short - ranged @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a key ingredient of csld is the choice of atomic configurations for the training and prediction sets . </S>",
    "<S> it is intuitively appealing to use snapshots from _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( aimd ) trajectories since they represent physically relevant low - energy configurations . </S>",
    "<S> however , these configurations give rise to strong cross - correlations between the columns of @xmath37 ( i.e. , high mutual coherence of the sensing matrix @xcite ) , which decreases the efficiency of cs due to the difficulty of separating correlated contributions to @xmath30 from different fcts . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most profound results of cs is that a near - optimal signal recovery can be realized by using sensing matrices @xmath37 with _ random _ entries that are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in this case , the contributions from different fcts are uncorrelated and can be efficiently separated using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : csfit ] ) . for the discrete orthogonal basis in the cs cluster expansion @xcite , i.i.d . sensing matrices @xmath37 </S>",
    "<S> could be obtained by enumerating all ordered structures up to a certain size and choosing those with correlations that map most closely onto quasi - random vectors . </S>",
    "<S> this strategy is difficult to adapt for csld since the taylor expansion employs non - orthogonal and unnormalized basis functions of a continuous variable , @xmath38 . to solve this conundrum </S>",
    "<S> , we combine the physical relevance of md trajectories with the mathematical efficiency of cs by adding random displacements ( @xmath39 0.1  ) to each atom in well - spaced md snapshots . </S>",
    "<S> to guarantees that all the terms in the @xmath32 norm have the same unit of force , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : force ] ) is scaled by @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath15 is the order of the fct and @xmath42 is a `` maximum '' displacement chosen to be on the order of the amplitude of thermal vibrations . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure was found to significantly decrease cross - correlations between the columns of @xmath37 and resulted in stable fits .    we begin by demonstrating the accuracy of our approach for two relatively simple cases , si and nacl . </S>",
    "<S> dft calculations were performed using the perdew - becke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) functional @xcite and projector - augmented wave ( paw ) potentials @xcite as implemented in the vasp code @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an overview of the predictive accuracy of csld is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : err - vs - nmax ] . </S>",
    "<S> we included up to the 6-th order fcts for a total of 712 ( si ) and 1375 ( nacl ) symmetrically distinct elements . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : csfit ] ) found 258 and 199 non - zero fct elements , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the errors decrease when higher order fct parameters are considered . </S>",
