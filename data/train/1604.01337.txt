    "in this article we study lattice gas models with certain long range pair interactions .",
    "our models are generalizations of certain mean field and random graph models , in which all sites or nodes interact with all others with equal strength .",
    "in contrast with mean field models , we allow the interaction strength to decay , but at a rate sufficiently slow that interactions between far away sites are still significant .",
    "our models can be described as follows .",
    "consider the cubic lattice in @xmath0 dimensions , rescaled so that the spacing between adjacent sites is @xmath1 .",
    "we consider configurations of particles on the @xmath2 lattice sites that fit inside the @xmath0-dimensional unit cube @xmath3^d$ ] .",
    "each configuration consists of an arrangement of particles on the lattice sites in @xmath4 .",
    "we say a site is occupied if there is a particle there ; each lattice site is either occupied by one particle or unoccupied .",
    "configurations are assigned an energy from a pair potential @xmath5 \\to { \\mathbb r}$ ] .",
    "interactions are only between occupied sites . the energy associated with distinct occupied sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 is @xmath8 , and the total energy of a configuration is obtained by summing @xmath8 over all occupied sites @xmath9 .",
    "we assume there is @xmath10 such that @xmath11 diverges at least as slowly as @xmath12 as @xmath13 . as a consequence ,",
    "the interactions between sites that are far apart ( relative to the lattice spacing ) make nontrivial contributions to the total energy .",
    "such interactions are sometimes called _ long range _  @xcite .",
    "equivalence of thermodynamic ensembles breaks down in this regime  @xcite , so we will consider only the microcanonical ensemble , in which energy density and site occupancy density are held fixed .    when @xmath14 is a constant function , our model is a microcanonical version of the curie - weiss mean field ising model .",
    "when @xmath15 , our model is related to certain random graphs .",
    "this is because the occupancy pattern on the lattice can be mapped to an adjacency matrix for a graph on @xmath16 nodes , where an occupied site is an edge in the graph , and an unoccupied site corresponds to the absence of an edge . in this case",
    ", @xmath14 corresponds to an interaction between graph edges . for discussion on the connection to the curie - weiss model and random graphs ,",
    "see the comments in section  [ sec : discussion ] below .",
    "we now give a rough description of our main results .",
    "each configuration can be described by an occupancy pattern  a function with value @xmath17 at each occupied site and @xmath18 at each unoccupied site .",
    "more precisely , each configuration corresponds to an occupancy pattern @xmath19 defined on @xmath4 as follows : if site @xmath6 is occupied ( resp .",
    "unoccupied ) , @xmath19 is equal to @xmath17 ( resp .",
    "@xmath18 ) on a @xmath0-dimensional cube of side length @xmath1 centered at @xmath6 .",

    "one can imagine that such @xmath19 is obtained by smoothing out occupancy pattern functions for large finite  @xmath16 , with @xmath25 representing the probability that site @xmath6 is occupied .",
    "the entropy density associated with the occupancy density @xmath19 is @xmath26\\,dx.\\ ] ] the entropy density is simply the log of the number of configurations with density approximately given by  @xmath19 , normalized by @xmath22 .",
    "the above heuristics show that as @xmath27 , the energy density , entropy density , and particle density can be accurately expressed in terms of the occupancy density @xmath28 .",
    "if these heuristics are correct , one expects that as @xmath27 , at fixed energy and particle density , configurations will have occupancy densities that approach optimizers @xmath29 of the entropy density   subject to the constaints on particle and energy density .",
    "it is then straightforward to write the corresponding euler - lagrange equations and , in principle at least , find the optimizers @xmath29 . for details on the above ideas from the point of view of large deviations",
    "theory , see for instance  @xcite .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is to show that the above heuristics can be made mathematically rigorous under very weak assumptions on the potential energy @xmath14 .",

    "rigorous results in the long range setting described above are relatively scarce .",
