    "in many applications it is desirable to shape a beam or pulse of light so that it has specific properties along the optical axis . in particular , for applications in microscopic imaging @xcite , optical tweezers @xcite , laser micro - machining @xcite , dressing of optical filaments @xcite , filament formation @xcite and long - range laser ablation @xcite , to name a few , it is important to have a well controlled beam with a nearly uniform intensity along the optical axis .",
    "however , due to their wave nature localized packets of light will broaden spatially through diffraction .",
    "for example , gaussian beams of width @xmath1 and wavenumber @xmath2 double in spatial extent over the rayleigh range @xmath3 @xcite .    in a linear , isotropic medium the electric field of a beam of light polarized in the @xmath4 direction can be modeled by a wave packet of the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes the spatial coordinate along the optical axis , @xmath7 are the cartesian coordinates transverse to the optical axis , @xmath8 is time and @xmath9 the carrier angular frequency of the wave . within the slowly varying _ ansatz _ on @xmath10 , the propagation of a beam with initial data @xmath11 at the @xmath12 plane",
    "is described by the paraxial wave equation : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the transverse laplacian defined by @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "exact solutions to equation ( [ intro : governingequation ] ) can be expressed in terms of an integral transform of the initial profile @xmath16 ; see [ appendix : solution ] .",
    "this integral transform is in fact equal to the fresnel diffraction integral @xcite .",
    "constructing solutions to ( [ intro : governingequation ] ) in free space that resist diffraction over length scales much larger than the rayleigh range has attracted considerable interest within the optics community .",
    "diffraction free beams are solutions to equation ( [ intro : governingequation ] ) satisfying the condition that for all @xmath6 , @xmath17 . if we make the _ ansatz _",
    "@xmath18 then diffraction free beams can be found by solving the two dimensional helmholtz equation .",
    "indeed , plane waves , bessel beams @xcite , mathieu beams @xcite and parabolic beams @xcite are examples of such solutions in various orthogonal coordinate systems .",
    "note , however , that the diffraction free beams described above are not realizable in practice since they carry infinite energy .",
    "one technique for obtaining finite energy approximations of such solutions is apodization at the input plane @xmath12 .",
    "that is , if @xmath19 solves ( [ intro : governingequation ] ) then apodized approximations to @xmath19 are found by solving ( [ intro : governingequation ] ) with the initial data @xmath20 where @xmath16 is a function of finite extent . in @xcite so called `` bessel - gauss '' beams were created by apodizing bessel beams with a gaussian function and a general framework for constructing gaussian apodized solutions to ( [ intro : governingequation ] ) was developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "bessel - gauss beams have received considerable interest because they can be produced experimentally , for example by a diffraction grating with concentric grooves @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a gaussian beam passing through an axicon lens produces a ring beam with a truncated gaussian cross - section that results from the division of the beam around the axicon tip @xcite .",
    "the effect of these optical elements is to create a linear superposition of gaussian beamlets whose individual wave vectors @xmath21 lie on a cone of aperture angle @xmath22 .",
    "the mutual interference of these beamlets generates the bessel pattern and due to influx of energy supplied by the oscillatory wings of the bessel function to the central core , these waves are robust to nonlinear losses and physical barriers @xcite .",
    "however , for a truncation of width @xmath23 the bessel - gauss beam only accurately approximates the ideal bessel beam in a `` bessel - zone '' of width @xmath24 near the tip of the axicon @xcite and then transitions to a ring - beam in the far - field @xcite .",
    "it was also shown by bagini et .",
    "@xcite that bessel - gauss beams can be created remotely by focusing ring beams .",
    "specifically , in cylindrical coordinates @xmath25 bessel - gauss beams can be generated remotely by solving equation ( [ intro : governingequation ] ) with the initial data @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the peak value of the electric field , @xmath28 is the radius of the ring beam , @xmath1 is the characteristic width of the ring , @xmath29 is the focal distance , @xmath30 is the zero order bessel function of the first kind and @xmath31 is a parameter related to the focusing of the beam @xcite .",
    "note that for this initial data the argument of the bessel function is complex valued and in particular if @xmath32  no focusing  it reduces to a modified bessel function of the first kind . in figure",
    "[ fig : genbesselbeams ] we provide a contour plot of the @xmath33 intensity profile for such a `` generalized '' bessel - gauss beams and select four radial cross sections to highlight the transition from a ring - beam into a bessel - gauss beam and back to a ring beam .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ fig : genbesselbeams ] , the intensity profile along the optical axis ( @xmath34 ) is not uniform in @xmath35 within the bessel - zone and is in fact given by a lorentzian - gaussian type function @xcite .",
    "the non - uniformity of the on - axis intensity limits the utility of bessel - beams in some applications . in this paper",
    "we explore the problem of applying additional phase shaping to the ring beam in order to create beams with specific properties along the optical axis . specifically , we consider the problem of constructing a phase function @xmath36 at the input plane @xmath12 that focuses a ring beam intensity profile @xmath37 of radius @xmath38 and width @xmath1 into a target intensity profile @xmath39 of width @xmath40 along the optical axis centered at a target distance @xmath29 . in figure",
    "[ fig : besselsubfig2 ] we illustrate the geometry and notation for the problem we are considering .",
    "the constants @xmath41 denote peak values of the electric field and @xmath42 , @xmath43 are smooth , non negative compactly supported functions with a maximum value of @xmath44 supported on the intervals @xmath45 and @xmath46 defined by @xmath47 respectively .",
    "simultaneous amplitude and phase shaping of the beam will achieve the task and indeed this problem was studied in @xcite .",
    "however , in practice this is achieved through holographic techniques which are difficult to implement and have low power efficiency @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : besselsubfig1 ] we illustrate one possible method for how phase shaping of ring beams can be achieved .",
    "first , a ring beam of radius @xmath38 and width @xmath1 is created by passing a collimated beam through an axicon or a concentric diffraction grating . the phase function",
    "is then applied , perhaps through a lens with a radially dependent thickness , which focuses the beam into the desired profile .",
    "the effect of adding a shaper phase @xmath36 can be realized by solving equation ( [ intro : governingequation ] ) with the initial data @xmath48 .",
    "the exact solutions to equation ( [ intro : governingequation ] ) can be expressed in terms of a hankel transform and the field along the optical axis is given by the following relationship : @xmath49 ( see [ appendix : solution ] ) . in this paper",
    "we consider the problem of optimizing the on - axis profile of the beam in the sense that we are interested in minimizing the @xmath0 norm : @xmath50 over the space of measurable phase functions @xmath51 .",
    "note that while the optimal axis is defined by the half - line @xmath52 we have defined the @xmath0 norm over the entire real axis .",
    "we make this definition as it allows us to use the @xmath0 isometry between a function and its fourier transform .",
    "moreover , this definition of the functional penalizes the beam wasting light outside the support of the target intensity distribution .",
    "since we are assuming that @xmath53 is compactly supported away from zero it follows from the change of variables @xmath54 and @xmath55 that @xmath56(\\omega),\\ ] ] where @xmath57 denotes the fourier transform from @xmath58-space into @xmath59-space .",
    "the optimal design problem can then abstractly be posed as finding a measurable phase function @xmath60 that minimizes the functional @xmath61 $ ] defined by @xmath62=\\left\\| g(\\omega)- |\\mathcal{f } \\left[g(s ) \\exp(i \\varphi(s))\\right](\\omega)\\right|\\|_{l^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are positive compactly supported functions .",
    "this abstract formulation can be identified with the specific application we are interested in by setting @xmath65 in the two - dimensional setting similar functionals have been studied within the context of shaping beams into desired intensity patterns in the focal plane of a lens @xcite .",
    "the variational problem we are considering is closely related to the problem of phase retrieval from two intensity measurements , i.e. the problem of determining the complex argument of a function given both knowledge of the modulus of a function and the modulus of its fourier transform .",
    "phase retrieval arises in applications in various fields ranging from astronomy @xcite , ultrashort pulses @xcite , radial beam shaping @xcite , pulse shaping @xcite , microscopy @xcite , to image reconstruction @xcite .",
    "a detailed review of the history of this problem and a number of numerical techniques that have been developed to solve this problem can be found in @xcite .    within the context of phase retrieval , the most common technique for optimizing @xmath66",
    "is the alternating projection algorithm pioneered by gerchberg and saxton @xcite and its variants such as the hybrid input - output algorithm discovered by fienup @xcite . in the original gerchberg - saxton algorithm",
    "the phase is recovered as follows :    1 .",
    "choose an initial guess @xmath67 .",
    "2 .   define @xmath68\\right)$ ] .",
    "3 .   define @xmath69\\right)$ ] .",
    "4 .   loop through items 2 and 3 until @xmath70 $ ] is sufficiently close to zero .    through plancherel s identity",
    "it can be shown that the gerchberg - saxton algorithm is an error reducing algorithm in the sense that @xmath71\\leq i[\\phi_{n}]$ ] @xcite .",
    "however , this property alone does not guarantee convergence of the algorithm . while projection algorithms converge on convex sets @xcite , the projections employed by the gerchberg - saxton algorithm are analogous to projections onto the boundary of the unit ball in @xmath72 which is clearly not convex",
    "this lack of convexity commonly leads to stagnation of the algorithm away from the global minimum which must be overcome by additional ad hoc means @xcite .",
    "indeed , additional techniques such as the hybrid input - output algorithm are commonly implemented along with the gerchberg - saxton to force the algorithm out of local minimum @xcite .",
    "other techniques for phase retrieval have also been developed including in the two diemnsional setting a variational principle for the transport of intensity distributions between two planes orthogonal to the optical axis @xcite .    in phase",
    "shaping , however , the infimum of @xmath66 may be significantly bounded away from zero and therefore when applied to our problem convergence of the gerchberg - saxton algorithm can not be assessed . indeed , without any further _ a priori _ information about the minimum value of @xmath66 stagnation of the algorithm is the only indication of possible convergence . moreover ,",
    "if the gerchberg - saxton stagnates at a large value of @xmath66 it may indeed be at the global minimum for the problem .      the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 we use elementary fourier analysis to deduce some basic results concerning the functional @xmath66 and translate these results in terms of the practical parameters for the phase shaping problem we are interested in . using plancherel s identity",
    "we obtain as a necessary condition for accurate beam shaping a normalization for the peak target intensity @xmath73 in terms of the design parameters : @xmath74 we also prove the existence of a minimum for this problem and in doing so obtain the regularity result that the optimal phase is the argument of an analytic function .",
    "finally , in using the uncertainty principle we prove _ ansatz free _ lower bounds on the minimum value of the functional .",
    "indeed we prove the following necessary condition for accurate beam shaping : @xmath75 although we discovered this result independently , romero and dickey are to the best of our knowledge the first to make the connection between the uncertainty principle and limitations in beam shaping arising from diffraction @xcite .",
    "our work goes beyond their treatment in that we prove in a mathematically precise manner the exact range of parameters for which the minimum value is bounded away from zero .",
    "in section 3 we use the stationary phase method to a construct a phase @xmath36 such that solutions to equation ( [ intro : governingequation ] ) with the initial data @xmath76 satisfy @xmath77 the phase is constructed as follows :    1 .   the following initial value problem is solved : @xmath78 2 .",
    "the phase is found by integrating : @xmath79    a similar approach was taken by friberg in the analysis of a logarithmic axicon lens @xcite . while friberg showed that the logarithmic axicon lens maps the support of @xmath53 into @xmath43 in the short wavelength limit ( @xmath80 ) , it fails to match the target intensity .",
    "our approach is more general in that for our construction the intensity distribution is exactly matched in the short wavelength limit .",
    "we would like to point out , however , that we are not the first to discover the use of the method of stationary phase for beam shaping . indeed , after we successfully extended friberg s analysis in @xcite to our setting we discovered that romero and dickey developed essentially the same algorithm in the two - dimensional setting in @xcite and further developed the theory in @xcite .    in section 4",
    "we explore how the method of stationary phase coupled with the gerchberg - saxton algorithm can be applied to practical problems .",
    "we consider three specific applications .",
    "we first study the problem of creating a near - uniform intensity along the optical axis down range from a source .",
    "specifically , we take the input beam to be a gaussian ring and the target profile to be a @xmath81-th order super - gaussian .",
    "we show that the stationary phase approximation yields a good initial guess that is further improved upon by the gerchberg - saxton algorithm .",
    "we also highlight the role of the uncertainty principle and show that accurate phase shaping is impossible for sufficiently small values of @xmath1 or @xmath40 .",
    "we also consider in this section the problem of creating beams with oscillatory intensity profiles .",
    "we show that that as a consequence of the uncertainty principle there is a cutoff in the period of these oscillations below which phase shaping can not adequately match the target intensity .",
    "we illustrate this by applying our algorithm to periodic intensity profiles with small scale oscillations .",
    "finally , we show in this section how the method of stationary phase coupled with linear temporal chirping can be used to form pulses with specified temporal widths at the target distance @xmath29 . specifically , by taking a separable spatio - temporal _ ansatz _ on the initial data we show that spatial phase shaping can be employed to correct for the additional spatial spreading of the beam arising from linear temporal chirping .",
    "we conclude with a summary and discussion of our results .",
    "in this section we use the abstract variational formulation of our problem to obtain quantitative information about our beam shaping problem .",
    "let @xmath82 denote the space of lebesgue measurable functions on @xmath83 and @xmath84 the space of smooth compactly supported functions on @xmath85 .",
    "recall from the introduction that we are interested in minimizing the functional @xmath86 defined by @xmath87=\\left \\|g-\\left |\\mathcal{f}\\left[g\\exp(i \\varphi)\\right ] \\right| \\right\\|_{l^2},\\ ] ] with @xmath88 having support bounded away from the origin . in terms of the particular beam shaping problem",

    "it is important to note that in our initial formulation of the problem we did not specify any constraints on the target electric field .",
    "throughout the rest of this paper we will assume this normalization and hence that @xmath101 which will be a critical assumption in the stationary phase analysis as well .",
