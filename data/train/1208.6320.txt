    "steinfadt et al.s ( @xcite ) discovery of the eclipsing double wd binary system  @xcite allowed for the first geometric measurement of the radius of a elm wd , finding @xmath9 for the @xmath10 he wd , consistent with the presence of a thick stably - burning hydrogen envelope ( also see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "additional eclipsing systems @xcite have led to even more constraints , although for some of the more compact systems it is not clear if the radius is truly the equilibrium radius of the wd or if it has been tidally distorted .",
    "multiple common envelope phases are possible in the formation scenario for elm wds , leading to elm wds in binaries with more massive wds .",
    "many of these will come into contact within 10gyr ( figure [ fig : wdmerg ] ) .",
    "indeed , a large number of the known double wd binaries contain elm wds ( @xmath11 , circled points ) with large ( @xmath12 ) radii indicative of a stable h burning shell @xcite . as noted by @xcite , since the time to burn the h envelope",
    "can easily exceed the time to reach contact , many of these elm wds will come into contact with the remaining h envelope .",
    "this raises the possibility for many new phenomena that we begin to explore here .",
    "the large radii of the elm wds means that roche lobe overflow ( rlo ) occurs at larger orbital periods than otherwise expected , so we start in  2 by examining the behavior of the radius of the elm wd as its h envelope is transferred .",
    "we follow in  3 by outlining the basics of mass transfer and highlighting some of the new possibilities when elm wds are donors .",
    "there is a more distinct possibility for thermally stable burning of the accreted h and he on the accreting wd and the initial contraction of the elm wd to mass loss allows for more stable mass transfer than that originally found for cold he wds @xcite .",
    "we perform the full evolution calculations in  4 , highlighting the new phases of h mass transfer , the special behavior near the period minimum , and the likelihood that the intruiging object is one of these systems .",
    "we close in  5 by discussing the implications for am cvn evolution , and the remaining work needed to resolve the thermonuclear outcomes for the accreted matter .",
    "the way in which the donor radius changes with mass loss differentiates the evolution of these elm donor binaries from the earlier work of @xcite for cold he wds , where the wd always becomes larger as mass is removed .",
    "this is usually expressed as the logarithmic derivative of radius with respect to mass @xmath13 which is @xmath14 for cold , degenerate matter",

    "however , the precise boundary is not yet known and may be metallicity - dependent .",
    "for instance , the recently discovered binary @xcite has an elm wd with a high temperature and a radius indicative of burning even though it is somewhat more massive ( @xmath17 ) than the expected burning limit , although for this particular object the unknown contribution of tidal heating may contribute to its large size .",
    "we limit our exploration to @xmath18 .",

    "these represent a large range of elm wd models ( @xmath20 ) that adequately cover the possible envelope masses ( @xmath21 ) at the time of roche lobe contact , or equivalently have ages of 113gyr ; for an age of 1gyr , the expected envelope masses according to @xcite are @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) to @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , but the exact mapping of @xmath16  to age is not known in detail . instead , we verify the starting models by noting that they span the observed range in surface gravity and effective temperature seen in elm wds ( e.g. , @xcite ) , with @xmath26,00020,000k and @xmath27 .",
    "we need to find @xmath28 as a function of the amount of mass that has been lost , @xmath29 , for each distinct initial model .",
    "these models have the temperature , pressure and abundance profile of a stably - burning pure h envelope in diffusive equilibrium with the he core .",
    "the resulting transitional h / he layer has an abundance profile set by chemical equilibrium in the changing electric field , as described in @xcite . as we show later",
    ", the thermal time at the base of the h envelope is longer than the mass transfer timescale , so that the material responds adiabatically to mass loss . to simulate mass loss",
    ", we simply go to the mass coordinate @xmath30 in the initial model and force that mass element to the surface by making its pressure artificially low ( we went to @xmath31 ; in contrast , the pressure at the h / he boundary is @xmath32 , while the pressure at the core is @xmath33 ) .",
    "as the underlying fluid elements now have lower pressures , we conserve their entropy by assuming that @xmath34 is constant , where the adiabatic index @xmath35 was @xmath36 for the region in question .",
    "the density is then computed from @xmath37 and @xmath38 following the equation - of - state ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) , and the composition of each mass element is assumed to be the same as in the original model .",
    "therefore , we need only integrate the pressure and radius with respect to the mass coordinate .",
    "this integration is done by shooting from the core toward the surface and from the surface toward the core and meeting at a mass coordinate in the middle ( the @xmath39 point , where the hydrogen and helium mass fractions are equal ) . selected results for 0.15@xmath40 elm wds",
    "are shown in figure  [ fig : radii ] , where we plot the radius as a function of the remaining mass along with the zero - temperature ( fully degenerate ) model used by @xcite .",
    "two things are obvious : ( 1 ) as the envelope is stripped , the slope @xmath41 so the donor shrinks ( as in @xcite for stable burners ) , and the slope is still greater than the @xmath42 value of the zero - temperature model even once @xmath43 ; and ( 2 ) the radii are always larger than the zero - temperature model , even when the envelope has been stripped , because of the lower initial degeneracy . in our models",
    "the larger radii are consequences of both finite ages so that even just passive cooling would result in warmer / larger wds ( unlike in @xcite ) and stable h burning ( unlike in @xcite ) . the initial core temperatures at the onset of mass transfer range from @xmath44k for the @xmath45 envelope to @xmath46k for the @xmath47 , with higher temperatures resulting in higher initial entropies @xcite .",
    "in figure  [ fig : zeta ] we compare our results for @xmath15  with those computed using ` modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics ` ( ` mesa ` ; @xcite ) . for our starting points ,",
    "the models of @xcite only covered limited values of @xmath19  and @xmath16 , as we used models that `` evolved '' from the starting models .",
    "similarly , with ` mesa ` we had to use models that we could construct out of suitable starting conditions , subject to mass loss and diffusive equilibrium .",
    "therefore the comparison is not exact : the ` mesa ` model has a total hydrogen mass of @xmath45 , radius of 0.048@xmath48 , and surface temperature of 7150k , compared to ( @xmath49 , 0.062@xmath50 , 7160k ) and ( @xmath51 , 0.048@xmath50 , 6500k ) , for our models .",
    "we can not simultaneously match the envelope mass , radius , and surface temperature .",
    "even so , the agreement for @xmath15  is good , and the model profiles ( the pressure and adiabatic index as functions of radius ) agree well .",
    "the main apparent difference is the `` hump '' in @xmath15  around a stripped mass of @xmath52 visible in our models but not in the ` mesa ` models .",
    "this occurs slightly before the hydrogen - to - helium transition and near the onset of degeneracy in the original model , and given the different mass coordinates at which this happens in our models versus the ` mesa ` models , the discrepancy is not surprising .",
    "we see that overall , the shape of @xmath28 in this adiabatic limit is constant in terms of @xmath53 .    whether or not adiabatic evolution is a valid assumption depends on the thermal timescale @xmath54 at the base of the envelope , which is where the luminosity is fixed and most of the excess radius beyond the degenerate helium core is located",
    ". mass - loss will be adiabatic if @xmath55 .",
    "for the models of @xcite , @xmath54 is typically a few myr , so for accretion that is faster than @xmath56 , our approximation is reasonable , and this regime encompasses most of the evolution we discuss below . for lower mass - loss rates , we should consider thermal evolution during the mass stripping , although at these rates the amount of mass stripped is low enough that it does not significantly affect our results .",
    "we start with a he wd donor with mass @xmath57 that is steadily losing mass onto an accretor ( typically a co wd ) with mass @xmath58 .",
    "the total mass is @xmath59 , while the binary orbital separation is @xmath60 and the orbital angular momentum is @xmath61 .",
    "the mass transfer rate is fixed by the rate of orbital angular momentum loss , @xmath62 via @xmath63 the accretor may have intermittent periods of unstable hydrogen burning ( classical novae , or cne ) that eject material from the binary ; therefore we can not assume that mass transfer is conservative but must instead track the mass lost by the binary , @xmath64 .",
    "we write this as @xmath65 , so that @xmath66 means the accretor , on average , keeps a constant mass ( e.g. , it ejects in each cn the amount of matter that has accreted ) , and @xmath67 means that the accretor keeps all the accreted mass .",
    "we do not recalculate the accretor s radius as it gains mass , as this is a small effect for the massive accreting wd . if the cn were to excavate material from the accreting wd , then @xmath68 , although we do not explicitly consider this situation .",

    ", gravitational - wave losses set @xmath62 to be @xcite : @xmath76 this remains true for wide systems , as the material transfers through an accretion disk .",
    "however , if there is not enough room for a disk ( based on eqn .  6 of @xcite ) then material will impact directly onto the accretor @xcite . in this case , the angular momentum of the accreted material is lost to the accretor .",
    "this angular momentum loss subtracts an additional @xmath77 from the quantity in the brackets in eqn .",

    "in reality , all of the @xmath79 may not be lost but some may be transferred back to the system via tidal coupling ( as in @xcite ) , but for now we explore the limit where this does not occur since the tidal timescales are largely unconstrained for the accreting wd .",
    "the importance of knowing the value of @xmath80 is highlighted by equation ( [ eqn : jdot ] ) .",
    "when @xmath67 ( i.e. , the transferred material stays on the accretor ) , the mass ratio @xmath81 decreases even more quickly , reducing dynamical stability (   [ sec : stable ] ) and increasing @xmath82 . on the other hand , when material is lost from the system ( i.e. , @xmath66 ) , then @xmath81 changes more slowly with a corresponding reduction in @xmath82 .",
    "it is the ability for the accretor to burn the accreting material at the supplied rate that determines @xmath80 .",
    "stable burning ( i.e. , burning the material at the accreted rate in a thermally stable manner ) implies @xmath67 , whereas unstable burning results in mass losing events ( e.g. , classical novae ) that drive @xmath83 .",
    "since no detailed calculations are available that cover accreted material with our particular abundance mixture ( almost pure h going to nearly pure he ) ; we base our current calculations on @xcite ; @xcite for h burning and @xcite for pure he burning .",
    "the transferred material at the onset of mass transfer is certainly pure hydrogen .",
    "if that material does not gain any carbon or oxygen contamination from the accreting wd , then it can only burn via the pp - cycle . though briefly considered by @xcite , no recent calculations have been done to explore the thermal stability of such a pure h layer .",

    "we therefore assume stable hydrogen burning when @xmath85 ( the green horizontal line in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdot ] ) , and assume that all the accreted mass remains on the accretor ( @xmath67 ) . for rates lower than this , we assume that the h burning is unstable , leading to roche lobe overflowing nuclear flashes and @xmath66",
    ". however , very little mass is transferred at these low rates , leading to a small impact on the outcome .",
    "the accretion rates needed for stable pure he burning are much higher than those for hydrogen . just as in h burning",
    ", the stability arises due to the increasing importance of radiation pressure and shell thickening , both occurring as the burning luminosity approaches the eddington limit @xcite .",
    "most thoroughly discussed in @xcite , this rate depends on the wd core mass , and , for the evolution of these binaries , allows for stable he burning only near the period minimum @xcite .",
    "this results in a narrow range of rates ( typically only a factor of @xmath86 , see the hatched region in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdot ] ) for which a wd can stably burn helium .",
    "this demands two comparisons for our calculations .",
    "first , a tracking of when the accretion rate is in the stable regime and for that duration , a confirmation that enough mass is transferred to build the steady state burning model .",
    "second , when @xmath87 reaches the upper limit of the stable burning regime ( meaning that the radius of the accretor exceeds its roche radius ) , we must account for the excess transferred matter that can not be stably burned by the accretor . for this calculation ,",
    "we simply assume ( as is commonly done ; @xcite ) that that matter is lost by the binary .",
    "hence , even in the stable regime we will sometimes set @xmath80 to a value that is different than zero .- order runge - kutta integrator , updating the value of @xmath80 is done so as to keep the rate of accreted material for the last iteration in the stable regime  no higher order derivative is used  which leads to the apparent numerical noise in figure  [ fig : mdot ] .",
    "this does not affect the outcome .",
    "] we do this so that @xmath88 does not exceed the limit for stable he burning ( essentially the eddington limit ) . when these conditions occur in our evolutionary scenarios , its almost always the case that @xmath89",

    "mass transfer is dynamically stable when the term in the brackets in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : jdot ] ) is positive for @xmath67 .",
    "if it is negative , the stellar radius will be larger than the roche radius after mass transfer , leading to a dynamical instability and merger .",
    "the form of this condition depends on whether the angular momentum of the material which leaves the donor can get back into the orbital angular momentum ( as assumed in disk accretion ) or becomes  lost \" in the accretor during direct impact .",
    "accretion via a disk is stable when @xmath90 for a cold wd , @xmath91 , leading to @xmath92 .",
    "this would imply stability if @xmath93 , the traditional criterion for stability . the additional angular momentum loss allowed by direct - impact changes the criterion to : @xmath94 this substantially reduces the allowed mass ratios for initially stable mass transfer @xcite especially for cold wds , or those with a finite entropy @xcite but no burning .",
    "however , as we show in figure  [ fig : zeta ] , he wds with thick , massive hydrogen layers have @xmath41 for stripped masses @xmath95% .",
    "@xcite were the first to explore the possibly different evolutions this allows for . just from eqn .",

    "hence , for almost all the mass ratios considered here , dynamical instability is not possible for disk - fed accretion and could only happen for direct - impact accretion when @xmath99 ( assuming a typical @xmath92 once the hydrogen envelope has been fully stripped ) .",
    "tidal interactions could work to stabilize these few unstable mass transfer cases ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but that is beyond the scope of our work .",
    "just as in the conventional double wd binaries , the lower mass elm wd will be driven into contact by the loss of angular momentum from gravitational waves . for the more massive companion , we presume cold co wds with masses 0.71.0@xmath40 ( we do not discuss masses @xmath100 , as those are not covered by the calculations of @xcite ) .",
    "we neglect any tidal heating of the elm wd prior to contact , and simply assume , as in the previous section , that it has a thick h envelope that is stably burning .",
    "we start by discussing the long period of stable mass transfer of the overlying h shell , then discuss the behavior near the period minimum and close with a brief discussion of the outgoing he mass transfer phase ; which is similar to that previously discussed in the literature .",
    "the larger stellar radius leads to the onset of mass transfer at orbital periods of @xmath101 minutes , much longer than expected for a thin - h - shell cooling wd .",
    "since @xmath102 , the donor shrinks under mass loss , so the mass transfer is stable and secularly driven at the rate implied by equation ( [ eqn : jdot ] ) when angular momentum loss is fixed by gravitational radiation ( see eqn .  [",

    "the amount of mass that has been stripped ( third panel down ) is simply what s needed to keep the stellar radius equal to the roche radius as the donor moves inward .",

    "note that this is not true in the period / mass range where direct - impact accretion occurs ( as presumably for hm  cnc ) , as that dramatically increases @xmath136 and so reduces the outgoing ( am  cvn ) population . in any case , finding these predicted systems remains a challenge .",
    "@xcite found it unlikely that v407  vul had the same origin as hm  cnc , as the lifetimes on the incoming versus outgoing branches would suggest that its orbital period should be increasing rather than decreasing ( @xcite find @xmath137 at an orbital period of 9.5min ) .",
    "we do not find quite such a strong preference , with @xmath1384 depending on the accretor mass ( compared to a ratio of about 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "still , the small orbital period derivative of v407  vul is somewhat difficult to explain , being a factor of 2 smaller than the lowest value we find in figure  [ fig : pdot ] . considering lower accretor masses may help resolve this .",
    "we have shown that the unique properties of elm wds  large , nondegenerate h - rich shells supported by stable h burning  lead to some new phenomena when mass transfer initiates in double - wd binaries . there is a prolonged period of h - rich mass transfer at a low rate during inspiral , with hm  cnc  potentially being the prototype .",
    "the change in the mass - radius relation for the donor creates an intrinsically more stable binary that opens up additional phase space for making stable he accreting binaries .",
    "this may increase the am cvn birthrate , potentially alleviating the apparent paucity of progenitor systems .",
    "those am cvns which emerged from this progenitor scenario will also have a larger he core radius than expected from an initially cold wd , thereby exhibiting a higher accretion rate at a fixed orbital period than from a cold wd @xcite .",
    "prior to the onset of mass transfer , the elm wds had gyrs to undergo diffusive settling and substantial burning of hydrogen . that clearly allows for the complete sedimentation of the heavier elements from the outermost layers of the wd .",
    "hence , the mass transferred will vary from nearly pure h , to nearly pure he .",
    "as we discussed , much work remains to more carefully calculate the thermonuclear outcomes from this mass transfer .",
    "if more thermally stable , then these systems may become more observationally detectable due to the higher luminosities .",
    "it is also interesting to note the pronounced absence of heavy elements in the x - ray spectra of hm  cnc  @xcite , also pointing to an elm origin that lived a long time prior to mass transfer initiation .",
    "if thermally unstable , then the accumulated mass could ignite explosively @xcite , potentially contributing to the increasing number of low - luminosity `` supernovae '' observed locally ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we thank bill paxton for advice on running mesa , and thank bill paxton and ken shen for helpful discussions .",
