    "there are still some serious ingredients in the fundamental interactions of elementary particles that have not been experimentally verified .",
    "the higgs particle(s ) and new heavy neutral gauge bosons @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , ... have not yet been established and physics of those particles still remain elusive . in recent years , the amount of works for searching for the higgs and extra gauge bosons have considerably increased and this research subject is now one of the most exciting topics in searching physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . on one hand , recent lep 2 experiments determined a lower bound of the higgs boson mass to be approximately 114.1 gev [ 1 ] .",
    "furthermore , it should be pointed out that the tevatron data [ 2 ] for searching for the low energy effects of quark - lepton contact interactions on dilepton production taken at @xmath5=1.8 tev are translated into lower bounds on the masses of extra neutral gauge bosons @xmath6 . on the other hand , recent theoretical progress on study of strong and electroweak interactions and the fundamental concept on natural extensions of the sm , have turned the physics of interplay between the known matter fields and exciting new phenomena related to new matter fields via new interactions .",
    "one of the most challenging current topics beyond the sm is to study physical implication of a set of higgs particles and extra gauge bosons predicted by the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) in the tevatron @xmath7 collider experiment at @xmath5=2 tev .",
    "the production of higgs bosons or their decays ( via the heavy quark / lepton interactions ) are promising and useful processes which would be searched for in the forthcoming high energy experiments . with the advent of the run ii at the tevatron",
    ", it is expected to be clarified that the intermediate heavy quark loop can be a sizeable source of higgs bosons in both cp - even ( light @xmath8 and heavy @xmath9 ) scalar and cp - odd pseudoscalar ( @xmath10 ) sectors . as for extra neutral gauge bosons @xmath11 , existence of those neutral gauge bosons",
    "are required by the models addressing the physics beyond the sm , such as supersymmetry ( susy ) , grand unification theory , superstrings and so on .",
    "the prediction for the masses @xmath12 of @xmath11-bosons is rather uncertain , though these bosons could be heavy enough with the masses @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the mass of the @xmath15-boson ) . the simplest version of existing @xmath11-bosons is based on the model with extension of the standard @xmath16 gauge group by an extra @xmath17 factor [ 3 ] .",
    "there are also many other extended models of the sm , such as the ones in which the @xmath18 gauge group is extended to @xmath19 [ 4 - 7 ] and to @xmath20 [ 8 ] . in those models , the massive su(2 ) extra gauge bosons ( corresponding to the broken generators ) could couple to fermions in different generations with different strength and thus could give the answer to the question of why the top quark is so heavy , since they might single out the fermions of the third generation .",
    "the precision measurements of electroweak parameters narrowed the allowed region of extra gauge boson masses keeping higgs boson masses to be consistent with radiative corrections including the supersymmetric ones .",
    "one of the goals of the present work is to examine the potential of the run ii experiment at the tevatron in searching for @xmath8- , @xmath9- and @xmath10- higgs bosons , new extra gauge bosons , and to give the estimation of the upper limits on the masses of stop quarks as well as the lower bounds on the masses of the scalar higgs bosons both in the light and heavy mass sectors .",
    "we first show how the existing tevatron bounds on the scale of quark - lepton compositeness [ 9 ] can be adopted to provide an upper limit of the quantity @xmath21 , i.e. the product of masses of stop eigenstates @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we also discuss how the lower bounds of the scalar higgs boson masses can be obtained from the forthcoming tevatron data .",
    "furthermore , we emphasize that the forthcoming experiments for discovering the supersymmetry in both higgs and quark sectors could lead to estimations of the masses of neutral and charged extra gauge bosons @xmath6 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "an example - the models in which the precision electroweak data allow the extra gauge bosons to be of the order @xmath24(0.5   tev ) are , e.g. , the noncommuting extended technicolor models [ 5 ] . the @xmath6 and @xmath2 bosons with such masses are of interest , since they are within the kinematic reach of the tevatron s run ii experiments",
    ".    then we also study the processes like @xmath25 keeping in mind that the main channels in the mssm are the scalar ones ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 mean a photon , a gluon , a lepton and a heavy quark , respectively ) since the pseudoscalar mode is largely suppressed in the wide range of the mssm parameters .",
    "since in two photons ( @xmath34 ) or two gluons ( @xmath35 ) decays the invariant mass of @xmath34 or @xmath35 system would be identical to the mass of the decaying boson , a promising way to detect @xmath8- and @xmath9-bosons at the tevatron is to search for the decays @xmath8 , @xmath36 and @xmath8 , @xmath37 as well .",
    "it is known that at high energy @xmath7 ( or @xmath38 ) collisions a contribution of gluonic interactions become large due to increase of gluon densities in the proton .",
    "the tevatron run ii experiment could observe the lightest higgs boson production via a two gluon fusion @xmath39 with the cross - section @xmath40 of an order @xmath41(1.0 pb ) at @xmath42 110 gev [ 10 ] .",
    "raise of the @xmath8-boson mass up to 180 gev would lead to decreasing of @xmath40 up to the order @xmath24(0.2 pb ) . for the @xmath10-higgs boson production",
    "the following important features are remarkable : + ( i ) the detection efficiency of the signal events has high accuracy because the decay of @xmath10 higgs - bosons can be precisely modeled in the kinematic region for various decay channels , e.g. , @xmath43 ( here , the leptons @xmath32 run over electrons @xmath44 , muons @xmath45 and @xmath46-leptons ) ; + ( ii ) the mass @xmath47 of the @xmath10 higgs - boson can be reconstructed from its final state to test the mass relation in the mssm mass sum rule [ 11 ] at the tree - level @xmath48 with its deviation due to radiative corrections ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the masses of the cp - even @xmath8 and @xmath9 higgs bosons , respectively ) .    the outline of the article is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we define the model .",
    "estimation of the upper limits of the masses of stop quarks as well as the lower bounds on the masses of the scalar higgs bosons will be discussed in sec .",

    "it is expected that the tevatron run ii experiments will be able to exclude @xmath6 bosons with masses up to 750 gev .",

    "note that recent experimental limits on @xmath338 and @xmath339 gauge bosons in the canonical left - right symmetric model [ 32 ] require that their mass be higher than about 800 gev .",
    "an important question is whether the forthcoming data at the tevatron run ii at @xmath5=2 tev will progress far enough to determine the lower bounds on the @xmath73-scale and the @xmath6 boson mass within the models considered in this work .",
    "+ a large decay width @xmath340 arises due to a sum of one - loop intermediate heavy quark states largely decaying into two gluons ( a new interaction of the @xmath8-higgs boson is extended only on the third family ) .",
    "the @xmath341 channel will be diminished , otherwise it must have already been established at the tevatron .",
    "the @xmath26 mode via a gluon fusion may be significantly enhanced in mssm .",
    "thus , this mode is a very promising channel to discover cp - odd higgs boson @xmath10 .",
    "discovery region for the @xmath227 mode might be enlarged as well as the @xmath228 channel , if a precise reconstruction of the mass of the @xmath10 -higgs bosons is available .",
    "the detection modes @xmath241 and @xmath242 may be good channels for discovery of two higgs bosons predicted in the mssm . + from the above consideration , we note that the tevatron run ii can catch an evidence of higgs bosons ( @xmath8/@xmath9 and/or @xmath10 ) whose dominant final states could be gluon jets and/or pairs of @xmath227 or @xmath228 instead of @xmath186 .      99 the lep higgs working group , r. bock et al . , cern - ep-2000 - 055 and lep experiments , aleph 2000 - 28 , delphi 2000 - 050 , l3-note 2525 , opal tn 646 .",
