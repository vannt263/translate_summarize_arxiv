    "et al@xcite proposed the use of pad approximants and later stubbins@xcite tried some other extrapolation techniques . without doubt , the most popular extrapolation strategy was proposed by ciowsloski@xcite and it gives rise to the connected  moments expansion ( cmx ) and leads to an expression for the systematic calculation of the energy of the ground state .",
    "knowles@xcite studied the cmx and derived an elegant and compact expression for the approximants in terms of matrices built from the cumulants .",
    "it is well  known that the series of cmx approximants for the energy exhibits singularities and convergence problems that limit its usefulness@xcite . in an attempt to overcome those difficulties some authors proposed variants of the cmx@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0expansion , as well as the cmx and its variants , have been tested on several simple models with varied success@xcite , and in spite of their notorious limitations they have even been applied to several problems of physical interest@xcite , including the calculation of the electronic energy of atoms and some small molecules@xcite .",

    "however , they can be improved by an appropriate choice of the reference function@xcite .",
    "the main reason for still insisting on the development of the cmx appears to be its size consistency@xcite which those other approaches do not obey . however , in most of the applications summarized above size consistency is not an issue .    in this paper",
    "we test the main assumptions of the cmx by means of simple quantum  mechanical models . in this way",

    "cioslowsky@xcite showed that one can obtain @xmath12 without explicitly calculating the nonlinear parameters @xmath24 . from the properties of the pad approximants",

    "we may say that the main assumption in the cmx is that equation ( [ eq : exp - exp ] ) is valid provided that @xmath34 .",
    "in such a case the ground ",
    "state energy is given by the limit of the cmx approximants ( [ eq : e0^(m ) ] ) for @xmath35 .",
    "if the square matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq : e0^(m ) ] ) is singular , the corresponding approximant is omitted .    in principle , it may happen that @xmath36 for some values of @xmath0 in the complex @xmath0plane .",
    "in such a case the cumulant expansion ( [ eq : t - exp ] ) converges for @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the root of @xmath36 closest to the origin .",
    "( the location of such singular points will obviously depend on the trial function @xmath39 ) .",
    "therefore , matching the taylor series about @xmath1 for the two sides of equation ( [ eq : exp - exp ] ) may give rise to some difficulties , especially because the expression in the right  hand side does not take into account such singular points .",
    "consequently , it is unclear that we can successfully extrapolate the approximate expression for @xmath2 thus derived to the limit @xmath3 .",
    "this aspect of the problem was addressed by witte@xcite and witte and shankar@xcite for some particular problems . in sections",
    "[ sec : simple_models ] and [ sec : oscillators ] we will show that under certain circumstances the main assumption of the cmx , namely equation ( [ eq : exp - exp ] ) , does not apply to some simple problems .",
    "the exponential expansion ( [ eq : exp - exp ] ) does in fact appear to take into account the singular points of the inverted series@xcite .",
    "if we keep the first two terms , solve for @xmath0 and differentiate with respect to @xmath40 we obtain @xmath41 this approximate result partially agrees with the exact one that we will derive for a two  level model in section  [ sec : simple_models ] .",
    "some time ago knowles@xcite applied the cmx to the two  level model @xmath42 and concluded that the series ( [ eq : e0^(m ) ] ) for the reference function @xmath43 converges to the exact eigenvalue for @xmath44 less than about @xmath45 , but as @xmath44 is increased the series converges to a result which is more and more in error .",
    "he also found that the cmx series reproduces the correct @xmath46power series for the same reference function but the series can become violently oscillatory when the reference function is @xmath47 .",
    "besides , in the limit @xmath48 alternate approximants for @xmath49 tend to zero and infinity .",
    "knowles@xcite concluded that those results placed some doubt on the claims that the series is convergent for any reference function having a nonzero overlap with the exact wavefunction .",

    "state energy @xmath55 and the excited  state energy @xmath56 with the former and latter reference vectors , respectively .",
    "the rate of convergence of the cmx series decreases ( increases ) with @xmath44 in the former ( latter ) case .",
    "convergence towards the excited state is unexpected because there is no doubt that @xmath2 always tends to @xmath12 as @xmath3 when @xmath34",
    ". it may be for this reason that convergence of the cmx series to excited states has been ignored as far as we know .",
    "a reasonable explanation for such anomalous behaviour is that the limit of the series of cmx approximants ( [ eq : e0^(m ) ] ) is determined by the maximum overlap @xmath57 as suggested by the fact that in the particular example just discussed @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xmath61 for all values of @xmath46 .",
    "we will discuss this issue in more detail below .",
    "it is obvious that if the series of cmx approximants converges to an excited state when @xmath34 then the main assumption of the method , equation ( [ eq : exp - exp ] ) , is not valid in general . in what follows",
    "we explore this point in more detail and write the cmx approximants to @xmath2 as @xmath62    the two  level system is suitable for a discussion of the convergence properties of the @xmath0expansion . in this case ,",

    "we see that the smallest radius of convergence occurs when @xmath68 .    for large @xmath0",
    "we have the exponential expansion @xmath69 and not the algebraic terms found by witte@xcite and witte and shankar@xcite for more elaborate models in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "although the large@xmath0 expansion of @xmath2 exhibits the correct exponential behaviour , it is not valid at the matching point @xmath1 unless @xmath71 .",

    "if we solve equation ( [ eq : e(t)_cj_2x2 ] ) for @xmath0 and differentiate the result we obtain @xmath74 that resembles the approximate expression ( [ eq : dt / de(app ) ] ) derived by amaj et al@xcite . by means of this simple model",
    "we realize why stubbins@xcite obtained reasonable results from a pad analysis of the derivative @xmath75 .",
    "note that in this case @xmath76 exhibits logarithmic singularities instead of the branch cut singularity appearing in the spin1/2 isotropic antiferromagnetic xy chain@xcite .",

    "[ fig : e(2 ) ] illustrates the behaviours of those functions .",
    "table  [ tab : a_0m_2x2 ] clearly shows that when @xmath122 @xmath112 already converges towards @xmath86 as @xmath115 increases as discussed above . we conclude that when @xmath87 the approximate functions @xmath123 obtained by matching the taylor series about @xmath1 can not exhibit the correct exponential behaviour for @xmath3 .",
    "it is not difficult to understand what happens when @xmath87 in the case of the two  level model .",
    "first of all note that @xmath124 .",
    "second , the exponential expansion of the cumulant  generating function ( [ eq : e(t)_cj_2x2 ] ) @xmath125 converges for all @xmath126 when @xmath87 .",
    "third , the match between the exponential expansion ( [ eq : e^(m)(t ) ] ) and the @xmath127expansion at @xmath1 is valid for both , positive and negative , values of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath128 the cmx simply chooses the convergent exponential expansion for @xmath98 and the result is the energy of the excited state .",
    "the cmx fails completely when @xmath68 because both exponential expansions ( @xmath95 and @xmath98 ) are divergent at @xmath1 .",
    "it is worth noting that the original approach of horn an weinstein@xcite in terms of pad approximants @xmath129(t)$ ] for @xmath2 yields accurate results in this most unfavourable case .",
    "these approximants exhibit either a saddle point or a minimum when @xmath115 is either odd or even , respectively . from such stationary points",
    "we obtain @xmath130 with @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "in addition to it , these pad approximants yield increasingly accurate estimates of the poles of @xmath2 at @xmath132 , @xmath133 .",
    "the behaviour of the exponential parameters discussed above is not restricted to the case @xmath82 .",
    "[ fig : bm3 ] shows that two of the exponential parameters @xmath134 behave in a similar way .",
    "the third one , which we arbitrarily chose to be @xmath135 , is real because the three parameters are solutions to a cubic equation .",

    "fig : a0m(theta ) ] shows @xmath138 for some values of @xmath115 .",
    "we appreciate that the series of cmx approximants converges towards @xmath85 when @xmath139 and towards @xmath86 when @xmath140 and diverges when @xmath141 is close to @xmath142 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "it is a further illustration and confirmation of the arguments above .",
    "these examples clearly show that the condition @xmath34 is insufficient to guarantee the validity of equation ( [ eq : exp - exp ] ) that is the main assumption of the cmx .",
    "in fact , they suggest that if @xmath143 is not the largest overlap , then the cmx series may converge towards an excited state in which case @xmath123 will not be an acceptable approximation to @xmath144 for @xmath95 , except for sufficiently small values of @xmath0 . besides , for some reference states ( like those with @xmath68 for the two  level model ) the cmx does not converge at all .",
    "it is not difficult to show that the results for the two  level model also apply to arbitrary problems .",
    "for example , if we choose the reference state @xmath145 then we draw conclusions similar to those above for @xmath146 because we already have a two  level problem .",
    "we have also carried out a numerical and analytical study of the cmx for hamiltonian matrices of greater dimension .",
    "for example , if we choose a diagonal matrix with elements @xmath147 , @xmath148 and the reference vector with coefficients @xmath149 , @xmath150 then the generating function @xmath2 is a ratio of polynomial functions of @xmath151 .",
    "the @xmath152power series ( large@xmath0 expansion ) converges for all @xmath153 that is quite close to unity . for this reason",
    "we expect some difficulties when matching the @xmath0 and @xmath152series .",
    "in fact , in this case the cmx series does not appear to converge towards the ground  state energy ( or the convergence rate is too small for practical purposes ) .",
    "the conclusions of the preceding section are not restricted to the particular case in which only a finite number of states contribute to @xmath2 . in what follows we consider quantum  mechanical systems with an infinite number of bound states . in order to keep present discussion as simple as possible in what follows",
    "we consider the harmonic oscillator @xmath154 if we choose @xmath155 where @xmath156 is a normalization factor , then the cmx converges towards the ground state because @xmath157 for all @xmath158 . in this case",
    "the exponential parameters for the case @xmath159 are @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 that are quite close to the actual excitations @xmath163 as expected .    if , on the other hand , we choose @xmath164 then the cmx converges towards the second excited state because @xmath165 .",
    "note that in this case @xmath27 and @xmath166 ; consequently @xmath123 will not be an acceptable approximation to @xmath2 beyond a sufficiently small neighbourhood of @xmath1 .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the exponential parameters @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "if we choose @xmath170 then the cmx series @xmath112 alternate between @xmath114 and @xmath171 for @xmath115 odd and even , respectively .",
    "this result is not surprising in the light of our previous discussion of two  level models . at first sight",
    "one may think that it suggests that the cmx fails when two overlaps are equal @xmath172 and greater than any other @xmath173 ; however , this is not the case .",
    "for example , the reference function @xmath174 satisfies @xmath175 but the cmx converges towards the ground state . in this case we obtain @xmath176 and @xmath177    as a nontrivial example we choose the anharmonic oscillator @xmath178 and the reference states @xmath179 the cmx series converges towards the ground  state energy in the former case ( @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 ) and oscillates around the second excited  state energy in the latter one ( @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 ) as shown in table  [ tab : a_0m_aho ] .",
    "one expects that @xmath186 for all @xmath187 and that @xmath188 for all @xmath189 .",
    "what we know for sure is that @xmath123 will not be an acceptable approximation to @xmath2 when @xmath190 except in a neighbourhood of @xmath1 as indicated by the exponential parameters @xmath134 .",
    "the main assumption of the cmx is that the exponential expansion ( [ eq : exp - exp ] ) is a suitable approximation to the cumulant  generating function ( [ eq : e(t ) ] ) when @xmath143 . up to now , it was believed that the only limitations of the method were singularities in the cmx approximants ( [ eq : e0^(m ) ] ) or an occasional divergence for some reference state . by means of simple quantum ",
    "mechanical models we have shown that the performance of the cmx is mainly determined by the overlaps @xmath191 .",
    "present investigation strongly suggests that the series of the cmx approximants ( [ eq : e0^(m ) ] ) converges towards the energy of the state with greatest overlap with the reference function .",
    "thus , we have the following situations :    * when @xmath157 for all @xmath187 the series @xmath112 converges towards the ground  state energy and we can say that the cmx is valid . * the series @xmath112 converges towards the energy of an excited state ( or oscillates about it ) . in such a case we may say that the cmx is still useful but its main assumption embodied in equation ( [ eq : exp - exp ] ) is no longer valid",
    ". this situation may happen when the reference state exhibits the largest overlap with an excited state .",
    "* the series @xmath112 does not converge at all and the cmx is of no practical utility .    in no case",
    "does the cmx converge to a meaningless limit as suggested by knowles@xcite based on results for a two  level model .",
    "the main conclusions of this paper agree with those drawn earlier that the cmx and its variants should be applied with extreme care in order to obtain useful results@xcite .",
    "in fact , in most cases the rayleigh ",
    "ritz variational method in the krylov space is by far preferable to the cmx and its variants@xcite .",
    "we have also shown that the original method of horn and weinstein@xcite yields accurate results in a case in which the cmx badly fails .",
    "the choice of an appropriate trial state may improve the results dramatically as illustrated by a recent study on the rabi hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "finally , one of the main contributions of this paper is that the analysis of the exponential parameters @xmath136 may provide an indication on the rate of convergence of the cmx approximants .",
    "if all such parameters are real and positive one expects a reasonable convergence towards the ground state ( provided that @xmath34 ) .",
