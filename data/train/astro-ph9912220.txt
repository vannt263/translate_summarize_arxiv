    "the properties of galaxies in the universe are determined by the behaviour of both the dark matter and the baryonic material from which they are made .",
    "the dynamics of the dark matter , which are determined by gravity alone , are now reasonably well understood .",
    "n - body simulations ( e.g. ) provide an accurate description of the evolution of structure into the highly non - linear regime where dark matter halos form ( see , for example ) .",
    "analytically , the press - schechter theory @xcite predicts to within @xmath0 the distribution of halo masses found in n - body simulations for a specified cosmology , whilst theoretically motivated fitting functions do even better @xcite .",
    "extensions of this theory @xcite predict , with reasonable accuracy , the hierarchical build - up of halos through the mergers of smaller progenitors ( see , for example , ) .",
    "the behaviour of the baryonic matter , on the other hand , is less well understood .",
    "the dynamics of the gas are not determined by gravity alone but also by hydrodynamical forces and radiative processes .",
    "since gas must cool into dense lumps before it can turn into stars , these processes are crucial for galaxy formation ( see , for example , ) .    in this paper",
    ", we compare the outcome of two widely used techniques for modelling the behaviour of gas as it forms into galaxies : semi - analytic modelling and direct simulation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) .",
    "semi - analytic models applied to cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmologies @xcite have met with considerable success in explaining many of the observed properties of the galaxy population , such as the luminosity function , the distributions of colour and morphological type , the counts as a function of magnitude and redshift ( e.g. ) , the properties of lyman - break galaxies @xcite , and the clustering of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the sph technique @xcite has been used by many authors to model galaxy formation ( e.g. ) .",
    "these simulations have been successful in producing objects with approximately the mass of galaxies and , in cosmological simulations , with approximately the right abundance .",
    "however , to date no simulation has been able to produce a realistic , rapidly rotating spiral galaxy starting from cosmological initial conditions ( e.g. ) .",
    "both techniques require a number of simplifying assumptions in order to model the evolution of cooling gas .",
    "for example , semi - analytic models assume that dark matter halos and their associated gas component are spherically symmetric , and that gas is efficiently shock - heated when halos collapse .",
    "sph , on the other hand , assumes that gas is well represented by a set of discrete particles .",
    "the two methods have different strengths and limitations .",
    "semi - analytic modelling can follow a large dynamic range of scales and is sufficiently flexible that the effects of varying assumptions and parameter values can be readily explored .",
    "sph , on the other hand , does not impose any restrictions on geometry and solves directly the approximate evolution equations for gravitationally coupled dark matter and dissipative gas .",
    "limited resolution , however , restricts the accessible dynamic range and the expense of large simulations makes it impractical to carry out extensive parameter space explorations . in both approaches , a phenomenological model for star formation and feedback must be coupled to the evolution of dark matter and gas in order to calculate observable properties of galaxies .",
    "generally , such models are more easily implemented in semi - analytic models than in sph simulations in which the behaviour of the phenomenological model itself often depends on resolution .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to determine the extent to which the two techniques of semi - analytic modelling and sph simulation produce consistent results for the evolution of cooling gas in the cosmological setting relevant to galaxy formation .",
    "there are several ways in which such a comparison might be carried out . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the statistical approach of comparing the properties of _ populations _ rather than of individual objects .",
    "this comparison is motivated by two considerations .",
    "firstly , we wish to understand how the different approximations inherent in the two techniques translate into differences in the _ average _ properties of the two models .",
    "secondly , both techniques have been used ( and continue to be used ) to study statistical properties such as galaxy luminosity functions and spatial correlation functions .",
    "it is clearly important to test how reproducible these bulk properties are using these rather different modelling techniques . a complementary approach , which we defer to a later paper , is to compare the properties of individual objects modelled using the two techniques .",
    "a secondary aim of our paper is to assess how the neglect of sub - resolution processes in sph simulations , i.e. star formation and feedback , can affect the properties of objects above the resolution limit .    when differences between the results of the two modelling techniques do arise , it is difficult to know which of the two , if either , is giving the  correct \" answer . in some cases , however",
    ", we can explore the reasons for a disagreement by altering parameters in the semi - analytic model which describe a specific physical process , for example , the galaxy merger timescale . in this way",
    ", we can identify specific areas of disagreement in which further theoretical work is required .",
    "this paper is laid out as follows . in  [ sec : moddets ] , we briefly describe the sph and semi - analytic models , and discuss in greater detail their specific implementation in this work . in  [ sec : compare ] , we compare several properties of the galaxies calculated using the two techniques , and uncover the reasons for some of the differences by varying key parameters in the semi - analytic models . finally , in  [",
    "sec : discuss ] , we present our conclusions .",
    "we now present the models of galaxy formation employed in this paper .",
    "since the sph and semi - analytic techniques are described in detail elsewhere , we give only a brief overview here , referring the reader to the appropriate references for further details where applicable .",
    "the sph technique is a lagrangian method in which the gaseous component of the universe is described by a set of tracer gas elements represented by particles within the simulation volume .",
    "estimates of local gas properties ( and their spatial derivatives ) for each particle are derived by smoothing over the properties of the @xmath1 nearest neighbour particles ( see for a review ) . for simulations of galaxy formation",
    ", the gas must also be able to cool radiatively .",
    "the simulation volume is initially populated with dark matter and gas particles , with a spatial distribution derived from a cosmological power spectrum .",
    "the equations of gravity and hydrodynamics are then solved over a succession of small timesteps in order to propagate the particle distribution forwards in time until the present day .",
    "simulations were carried out for two of the cold dark matter cosmological models studied by : @xmath2cdm ( mean mass density parameter , @xmath3 ; cosmological constant , in units of @xmath4 , @xmath5 ; hubble constant , in units of 100 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , @xmath7 ; and rms linear fluctuation amplitude in @xmath8mpc spheres , @xmath9 ) , and scdm ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) . the baryon fraction in each cosmology was set , from nucleosynthesis constraints , to be @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the simulations , which were carried out using the parallel ap3m - sph code of , have @xmath15 particles of each species in boxes of side 70@xmath16 mpc and 50@xmath16 mpc in the @xmath2cdm and scdm models respectively .",
    "the gas mass per particle is therefore @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the @xmath2cdm and scdm cosmologies respectively .",
    "since we adopt @xmath19 , the smallest resolved objects have a gas mass of @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the two cosmologies .",
    "an unevolving gas metallicity of 0.3 times the solar value was assumed , taking into account that gas cooling in objects above the resolution threshold will already have been processed by several previous levels of the merger hierarchy .",
    "the sph simulations use a cooling function which is a series of power - law fits to the results of . if instead the tabulated cooling function of is used ( this being the function used in the semi - analytic models ) then around 10% more cold gas results by @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we employed a comoving @xmath23-spline gravitational softening equivalent to a plummer softening length of @xmath24kpc for @xmath25 in @xmath2cdm and @xmath26kpc for @xmath27 in scdm . at lower redshifts , the softening remained fixed at @xmath28kpc in physical coordinates , and the minimum sph spatial resolution was also set to match this value .",
    "approximately 10,000 timesteps were used in each simulation to evolve from @xmath29 to @xmath22 . with our chosen parameters ,",
    "the simulations are able to follow the cooling of gas into galactic dark matter halos .",
    "the resulting `` galaxies '' typically have 50 - 1000 particles .",
    "dark matter halos were identified at @xmath22 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "simulation outputs at higher redshifts were available , but so few galaxies have formed beyond @xmath30 in these small volumes that no statistically meaningful comparison could be made at higher redshifts .",
    "halos were found using the friends - of - friends ( fof ) group finding algorithm @xcite with a linking length of @xmath31 times the mean interparticle separation in scdm . in @xmath2cdm , we assume halos form with the overdensity predicted by the model of and therefore use a linking length which grows from @xmath32 at @xmath33 to @xmath34 at @xmath30 .",
    "consistent definitions of halo overdensities are adopted in the semi - analytic models considered .",
    "`` galaxies '' were also found using this algorithm , but with a much smaller linking length of @xmath35 .",
    "galaxies are made of gas particles that have cooled below 12,000  k and represent overdensities of @xmath36 .",
    "a complete description of the simulations and the properties of the simulated galaxies is given by .",
    "the key assumption of the sph technique is that the evolution of gas may be approximated by the evolution of a set of particles .",
    "each particle may be thought of as a packet of gas that `` carries '' with it the thermodynamical properties of the system .",
    "the smoothing inherent in the sph technique introduces problems whenever gas properties vary discontinuously ( or at least on scales much smaller than the smoothing scale ) . in the case of shocks ,",
    "an artificial viscosity term is used to capture the shock and prevent it from being smoothed away by the sph algorithm .",
    "another example of this kind of problem occurs in a multiphase gas ( although see ) , in which the sharp boundary between phases is smoothed over , causing the phases to diffuse into one another .",
    "this problem can lead to runaway cooling in the centres of dark matter halos , as happened , for example , in one of the simulations of .",
    "the simulations of attempt to circumvent this problem by ignoring the contribution of cold ( @xmath37k ) particles in the computation of the densities of hot ( @xmath38k ) particles .",
    "( for a complete discussion of this approximation see ) an important consequence of this approximation is that galaxies in the simulations match the shape of the observed galaxy luminosity function at the bright end .",
    "a further limitation arises from the fact that the sizes of the galaxies that form in the simulations are determined primarily by the gravitational force softening length rather than by any real physical process .",
    "this raises the possibility of enhanced tidal disruption , drag , and merging within dark matter halos .",
    "whilst the softening length is kept fixed in physical coordinates at low redshift , it is fixed in comoving coordinates at high redshift , as described in ",
    "[ sec : simspecs ] .",
    "thus for @xmath27 the _ physical _ softening length in the @xmath2cdm simulation is larger than in the scdm simulation and , as a result , non - physical effects due to softening may be expected to be more pronounced at early times in the @xmath2cdm simulation .",
    "although a variety of prescriptions have been tried in attempts to model supernovae feedback in sph simulations , usually by converting cold gas into `` star particles '' which then inject thermal and kinetic energy into the surrounding gas ( e.g. ) , this process remains poorly understood . in cosmological sph simulations , gas can only begin to cool efficiently in objects well above the minimum resolved halo mass , around several times @xmath39 in our case .",
    "thus , resolution effects prevent all the gas from cooling in small halos at high redshift , a process that , in reality , is probably due to feedback from supernovae or other energetic sources .",
    "the resolution of our simulation was , in fact , chosen to ensure that the fraction of baryons that cools by the present in the scdm model is comparable to the observed fraction of cold gas and stars in galaxies today .",
    "this was achieved by carrying out several test simulations with varying resolution until the desired cold gas fraction was obtained @xcite .        in semi - analytic models ,",
    "some of the processes involved in galaxy formation ( e.g. the growth of dark matter halos by mergers of smaller halos ) are followed using analytic solutions and monte - carlo techniques .",
    "other , more uncertain processes , such as feedback from supernovae are modelled by means of simple , physically motivated rules .",
    "typically , each such rule contains one or two free parameters which are constrained using observations of galaxies in the local universe ( e.g. ) .    in semi - analytic models , the dynamics of the gas are strongly coupled to the evolution of dark matter halos and to the processes of star formation and feedback . the starting point for our own modelling",
    "is the set of dark matter halos at @xmath22 drawn from the press - schechter mass function . a merging history for each halo",
    "is then constructed using the extended press - schechter formalism . beginning with the earliest progenitor halo",
    ", our model assumes that gas ( initially assumed to have zero metallicity ) is shock - heated to the virial temperature of the halo , after which it begins to cool according to a specified cooling function .",
    "any gas that does cool forms a galaxy at the centre of the halo within which stars begin to form at a specified rate , producing both metals and supernovae .",
    "supernovae reheat some of the gas in the galaxy , ejecting it back out into the surrounding halo .",
    "( this gas is not allowed to cool again until the halo has merged to form part of a larger halo . )",
    "these processes continue until the halo mass has increased by a factor of two or more , either by merging with a larger halo , or by numerous accretions of smaller halos .",
    "any leftover hot gas becomes part of the new halo , and the largest galaxy of the newly formed halo becomes the central galaxy , onto which further gas can cool .",
    "any other galaxies become satellites in the new halo , and may eventually merge with the central galaxy due to energy loss by dynamical friction .",
    "the full model includes other processes such as stellar population synthesis and morphological evolution which are not directly relevant to the present work .",
    "as well as this `` full '' semi - analytic ( ) model , for the purposes of this work we have constructed a `` stripped - down '' semi - analytic ( ) model which is designed to be directly comparable to the sph simulations ( in a statistical sense ) . in the  model ,",
    "we switch off star formation and the associated supernovae feedback and chemical enrichment , since these processes are not included in the sph calculation .",
    "instead , we assume a fixed metallicity of 0.3 times the solar value , just as in the simulations .",
    "we also mimic the sph resolution by truncating halo merger trees at @xmath40 times the dark matter particle mass in the simulation , and by switching off gas cooling when the hot gas mass is less than @xmath40 times the gas particle mass .",
    "the parameter @xmath41 is set to @xmath42 , i.e. twice the number of particles in the sph smoothing kernel .",
    "this value was chosen since it allows the  model to match the position of the peak in the galaxy mass function in the sph simulations ( as will be shown in ",
    "[ sec : massfunc ] , see fig .",
    "the  model has no such truncation of merger trees and has effectively unlimited resolution ( in practice , we resolve progenitor halos down to masses several hundred times smaller than in the sph and  models ) .    to further emulate conditions in the sph simulations in the  model",
    ", we replace the press - schechter formula for the mass function of dark matter halos ( which is commonly used in semi - analytic models , including our model ) with the formula proposed by which provides a better match to the results of large n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "although this ensures that the abundance of halos at @xmath22 in the model is similar to that in the sph simulations , it does not guarantee that the distribution of progenitor halo masses will also be the same .",
    "in fact , as has been shown by , we find that at high redshifts the merger trees in our  model underpredict the abundance of progenitor halos seen in the sph simulations .",
    "we reconcile the progenitor distributions in the two models by adopting a simple , empirical correction .",
    "we scale the value of the extrapolated critical linear threshold for collapse from the spherical collapse model , @xmath43 , by a redshift - independent factor , @xmath44 , such that @xmath45 .",
    "( thus , in the standard form of the extended press - schechter theory , @xmath46 . )",
    "this approach is similar to that proposed by .",
    "the factor @xmath44 is allowed to be a function of the @xmath22 halo mass .",
    "we find that the following simple form for @xmath44 provides a reasonable fit to progenitor mass functions in the sph simulations over the redshift range 0 to 3 : @xmath47 , & \\hbox{scdm } \\\\",
    "1 + 0.14 \\left [ \\log ( m_{\\rm halo}/h^{-1}{\\rm m}_\\odot ) - 15.64\\right ] , & \\lambda\\hbox{cdm . } \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{eq : fdc}\\ ] ] this correction to the extended press - schechter theory is based purely on an empirical fit to our two simulations .",
    "it is designed to minimize differences in the statistical properties of the dark halos in the two models , so that we can focus on differences in their gasdynamical properties . given the limited statistics provided by our relatively small simulation volumes , this correction should not be regarded as appropriate in a general sense and may not be accurate for larger volumes or for different power spectra to those considered here . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmprog ] we show the mass function of progenitor halos at @xmath48 for parent halos in the mass ranges @xmath49@xmath50 and @xmath51@xmath52 , defined so that @xmath53 is the number of progenitors in the mass range @xmath54 to @xmath55 per parent halo .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the distribution from our  model with the above correction , whilst the solid lines show the model without the correction .",

    "the semi - analytic model of was used to simulate galaxy formation in a large sample of dark matter halos spanning a wide range in mass .",

    ", 100 halos were simulated . in the  model",
    "the mass range was extended down to @xmath58 , and between 4 and 20 halos were simulated in each mass bin ( fewer halos were simulated for the most massive bins as these are computationally more expensive ) . to study the clustering of galaxies in the semi - analytic models",
    ", we used the techniques of and populated halos in the sph simulations with `` semi - analytic '' galaxies .",
    "the cosmological parameters required as input into the semi - analytic model ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) were set to the same values used in the sph simulations .",
    "the remaining parameters of the  model were set equal to the values chosen by ( for @xmath2cdm ) and by ( for scdm , for which we used the parameters of their @xmath64cdm model ) .",
    "parameters were chosen so as to obtain a model which produces a reasonable match to the local b and k - band luminosity functions and other local data ( as described by ) .",
    "these parameters can be split into two classes : those that affect the results of the  model and those that do not .",
    "the latter , however , are still important for specifying the behaviour of the model .",
    "parameters that do not affect the  model are those which govern star formation , feedback from supernovae and the production of metals by stars .",
    "we do not discuss them in any detail here but refer the reader to for a full description .",
    "the parameters which do affect the results of the  model ( and whose specific values tend to be inspired by the results of simulations ) are the following : ( i ) @xmath65 , the dynamical friction coefficient that determines the merger timescale for galaxies orbiting in halos ( see eqn .",
    "[ eq : merge ] ) ; ( ii ) the dark matter density profile ; ( iii ) the gas density profile ; ( iv ) the progenitor halo mass resolution ; and ( v ) the critical mass for cooling ( ( iv ) and ( v ) are both specified by @xmath66 ) . unless otherwise stated , we set @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and assume ( a ) that the dark matter density profile has the form proposed by , namely , @xmath69 ^ 2)},\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is a scale - length , and ( b ) that the gas density has an isothermal profile at large radii , and a constant density core of size @xmath71 , i.e. @xmath72 the core radius is initially set to some fraction of the nfw scale - length , @xmath73 , of the dark matter halo . our standard choice for this fraction is 0.33 , motivated by the results of hydrodynamical simulations of cluster formation @xcite .",
    "the gas that is able to cool in a halo is the densest gas , which has the lowest entropy .",
    "when halos merge to form a new halo this low entropy gas , which would normally settle into the inner parts of the halo , is missing .",
    "we take this into account by increasing the core radius of later generations of halos so that the gas density at the virial radius is the same as it would have been if no gas had cooled in progenitors ( for a full description see ) .",
    "the model also allows us the option of keeping the core radius fixed , which we explore below .",
    "the inclusion of a core in the hot gas profile prevents the formation of extremely bright galaxies in the centres of groups and clusters , which would otherwise lead to a disagreement with the shape of the bright end of the observed galaxy luminosity function .",
    "the reasons for choosing this particular profile are therefore identical in spirit to those for preventing runaway cooling in the sph simulations ( see  [ sec : sphass ] ) .",
    "semi - analytic models make several assumptions in the treatment of gas in order to obtain simple , analytic solutions to complex hydrodynamical processes .",
    "we have already mentioned the important assumptions of spherical symmetry and of the shock - heating of the gas to the virial temperature of its associated halo .",
    "the hot gas is then further assumed to settle into a distribution with a universal form .",
    "finally , the amount of gas that is able to cool by time @xmath74 after the formation of the halo is identified with the gas contained within the radius at which the cooling time equals @xmath74 .",
    "once it has cooled , this gas is assumed to flow to the centre of the halo , where it is available for star formation , provided that the free - fall time for the gas is also less than @xmath74",
    ". we shall refer to this as the `` cooling radius '' prescription .",
    "in this section we compare several properties of the galaxy populations that form in our models and consider how this comparison is affected by varying certain assumptions and parameter values .",
    "we begin by comparing the most basic quantities calculated by each technique , namely the fraction of gas in the hot and cold phases , both globally and as a function of dark matter halo mass . for these purposes ,",
    "we define a ` hot halo gas phase ' as gas hotter than @xmath75k ; a ` galaxy phase ' represented by cool , dense gas in the sph simulation and sdsa , and also including stars in disks and spheroids in the fsa ; and an ` uncollapsed gas phase ' consisting of everything else  i.e. gas outside virialised halos .",
    "note that for the galaxy phase , we consider only galaxies with a mass greater than @xmath40 gas particles in the sph and  models , but include galaxies of all masses in the  model .    in the press - schechter ( or sheth - mo - tormen ) theory , all the matter in the universe",
    "is deemed to be in halos of some mass , and semi - analytic models assume that gas in halos is shock heated to the halo virial temperature",
    ". we can therefore determine the fraction of gas in the uncollapsed gas phase in the  model simply by integrating over the analytical mass function @xcite from zero mass to the mass corresponding to a virial temperature of @xmath75k . according to the spherical top - hat model of halo formation ,",
    "the mass corresponding to @xmath75k is : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the overdensity of a newly formed , virialised dark matter halo at redshift @xmath78 ( e.g. ) . since some halos hotter than @xmath79 are not resolved in the  model , the integration in this case is carried out from zero mass to @xmath80 or to @xmath40 dark matter particle masses , whichever is largest .",
    "this estimate does not correspond exactly to the situation in the sph simulation in which the largest halos are surrounded by gas at temperatures above @xmath75k which extends beyond the virial radius .",
    "because of this , the model calculation will effectively overestimate the amount of uncollapsed gas relative to the sph simulation . on the other hand , gas in the sph simulation tends to be slightly more extended than assumed in the semi - analytic model ( i.e. the simulated clusters tend to have a baryonic content slightly smaller than the universal baryon fraction within a radius enclosing an overdensity of 200  see e.g. ) .",
    "these two effects counteract each other to some degree .",
    "the amount of gas in the hot and galaxy phases depends upon the rate at which gas cools .",
    "therefore this comparison tests model assumptions relating to the process of gas cooling , such as spherical symmetry and the cooling radius prescription in the semi - analytic models or the effects of smoothing in sph .",
    "this test will therefore be sensitive to the choice of gas density profile in the semi - analytic models and to @xmath1 in the simulations .",
    "since this comparison is concerned only with the total amount of gas in different phases , it is insensitive to the way in which the gas is apportioned into galaxies within a single halo , at least in the sph and sdsa models . in the  model ,",
    "some dependence on galaxy merger rates may exist , since merging can affect the star formation rate in a galaxy and thus alter the amount of gas reheated by feedback , as well as the rate of chemical evolution , which in turn alters the cooling rates in subsequent generations of halos .      figure [ fig : gastemp ] shows the fraction of gas in each of the three phases : hot halo , galaxy and uncollapsed , as a function of redshift . in both cosmologies , the uncollapsed gas fraction in the  model is quite close to , although somewhat larger ( by @xmath81 ) , than in the sph simulation at low redshifts . at @xmath22 ,",
    "the fractional difference is @xmath82 .",
    "given the caveats mentioned above , this level of agreement is pleasing . in the  model ,",
    "the fraction of gas in the uncollapsed phase is significantly lower than in the sph simulation and the  models .",
    "the only differences between the and  models in this calculation is the numerical resolution and the use of the press - schecther mass function in the  model and the sheth - mo - tormen in the  model .",
    "it turns out that these differences contribute about equally to the discrepancy in the fraction of uncollapsed gas in the two cases at @xmath22 .",
    "( the press - schechter mass function contains more low temperature halos than the sheth - mo - tormen mass function . ) at higher redshift , resolution effects are the dominant factor .",
    "the gas belonging to sub - resolution halos is classed as uncollapsed gas in the  and sph cases , but is accounted for as hot halo or galaxy gas in the  case .    in the galaxy phase , which is the most interesting from the perspective of galaxy formation , the  and sph models again",
    "agree extremely well at all redshifts in both cosmologies .",
    "the fractional difference , defined as @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the masses of galaxy gas in the  and sph models respectively , is close to 50% at @xmath48 in the scdm cosmology , but is much smaller in @xmath2cdm .",
    "half of the @xmath22 mass of galaxy gas has cooled by @xmath86 and @xmath87 in scdm and @xmath2cdm respectively . below these redshifts ,",
    "the fractional difference between the  and sph models is everywhere less than 25% .",
    "the agreement between the hot halo gas in the  and sph models is also very good . for @xmath2cdm , at @xmath22 ,",
    "the two models differ by only 20% .",
    "this is a non - trivial result .",
    "one of the most uncertain assumptions of the semi - analytic technique is that gas is shock - heated to the virial temperature of the parent halo .",
    "it is therefore reassuring that the amount of hot halo gas turns out to be similar to that seen in the sph simulations .",
    "the  model predicts significantly more galaxy gas than the sph and  models .",
    "since the merger trees in this model have effectively no mass resolution limit , gas cools very efficiently at high redshifts in small halos .",
    "however , feedback reheats a significant fraction of this gas , reducing the galaxy phase fraction . in scdm",
    ", stronger feedback is required to match the observed galaxy luminosity function than in @xmath2cdm , and this is reflected in a smaller galaxy gas fraction .",
    "since it is @xmath40 that determines which halos are resolved in the  model , this parameter affects the gas fractions in all three phases .",
    "for example , reducing @xmath40 from 64 to 32 worsens the agreement between the galaxy phase fractions in the  and sph models in the @xmath2cdm cosmology as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gastemp_nsph32 ] , although the two models are still reasonably close , differing only by approximately @xmath88 at @xmath22 .",
    "the differences produced by this entirely plausible change in @xmath40 are indicative of the degree of uncertainty inherent in these comparisons .",
    "figure [ fig : coldgas ] shows the mass of `` galaxy - phase '' gas , expressed as a fraction of the total ( i.e. dark matter plus gas ) halo mass and scaled by the universal baryon fraction . at @xmath89",
    "the quantity shown is the fraction of gas which exists in progenitors of the @xmath22 halos in each mass bin .",
    "this is a bulk quantity for each halo and is independent of the way in which gas is divided among the galaxies that reside in each halo .",
    "the  model predicts somewhat less galaxy gas than the sph simulation , particularly in the @xmath2cdm cosmology .",
    "the difference is typically @xmath0 , except at low masses where the agreement is better .",
    "( we do not plot error bars for the largest mass bins in the sph simulations because they contain only one or two halos . )",
    "we note that this is significantly more than the 10% change in cooled gas mass found by when the cooling function was used in sph simulations ( which , in any case , increased the amount of gas that cooled ) . at higher redshifts ,",

    "we have also compared the outcome of the sph simulations with a full semi - analytic model , in which the star formation and feedback prescriptions are restored and no artificial resolution limit is imposed .",

    ". the main conclusion of this paper is that the agreement between the sph simulation and the stripped - down version of the semi - analytic model is better than a pessimist might have expected .",
    "the tests we have carried out generally show reasonable agreement between the two techniques , although we have found significant differences in the cold gas mass functions in the two models .",
    "since in both approaches the gas physics are necessarily treated in an approximate fashion , it seems inappropriate to regard one as ` correct ' and the other as ` wrong , ' in the instances where discrepancies arise .",
    "specifically , our main results may be summarized as follows :    \\(i ) over the simulation volume as a whole , the global amounts of gas in the three main phases that develop ( hot , cold galactic and uncollapsed ) are very similar in the  model and the sph simulation . from @xmath105 ( the redshift by which about half the final amount of galaxy gas has cooled ) to the present ,",
    "the maximum difference is never larger than 25% .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , the model produces slightly _ less _ hot gas than the sph simulation at all epochs ( although this difference may not be significant given the uncertainties inherent in this comparison ) .",
    "the distribution of cold gas in halos of different mass also agrees quite well ( to within @xmath123 ) with the largest differences occuring in the most massive halos .",
    "these results apply to the sph and  models in their standard forms , i.e. with parameters chosen independently of this comparison in order to match certain observational constraints .",
    "thus , we conclude that in spite of its various approximations ( e.g. spherical symmetry ) , the simple model of gas cooling normally employed in semi - analytic models gives similar results , on average , to the sph simulations .",
    "\\(ii ) even though the total amount of cold gas is similar in the  model and the sph simulations , the actual cold gas mass functions ( i.e. the abundance of galaxies as a function of cold gas mass ) are different , particularly in the @xmath2cdm cosmology . in this case",
    ", the sph simulation produced three to four times more high - mass galaxies than the  model , or equivalantly , at a fixed abundance , galaxies in the sph simulation are , on average , twice as massive as their counterparts .",
    "we were able to discount a difference in galaxy merging rates as the dominant source of this discrepancy .",
    "instead , we identified as the culprit a difference in the efficiency of cooling in massive galaxies : more gas cools into these galaxies in the sph simulation than in the standard  model .",
    "thus , artificially increasing the cooling rate of gas in the  model ( by assuming that the core radius of the gas density profile remains fixed rather than growing with time as in our standard model ) leads to excellent agreement with the sph galaxy mass functions and also with the mass functions of galaxy progenitors .",
    "\\(iii ) the spatial distribution of galaxies , as characterised by the two - point correlation function , is remarkably similar in the semi - analytic and sph models .",
    "this is true not only of the present - day distribution , but also of the clustering at high redshift .",
    "this conclusion also holds even when the cooling rate is enhanced in the  model as discussed in ( ii ) .",
    "the primary limitation of current cosmological sph simulations is the relatively poor resolution attainable even with the largest computers . by comparing our sph or  models to the full semi - analytic model ( fsa )",
    ", we gain some idea of how important these resolution effects are in practice . furthermore , since the  model includes prescriptions for star formation and feedback that are not modelled at all in the sph simulations we have considered , we can also assess how important these processes are in determining the properties of hot and cold gas in the moderately large galaxies that form in our sph simulations .",
    "the total amount of gas that can cool in an sph simulation is determined by the resolution limit . on the other hand , because of its intrinsically high resolution , the semi - analytic model traces the evolution of gas even in small halos which the sph simulation assigns to the uncollapsed phase . as a result , not only is the fraction of halo gas ( hot and cold ) larger in the  model than in the sph simulation , but its cold gas mass function extends to smaller masses that can be resolved in the sph simulation .",
    "the fsa cold gas mass function has a much sharper cut - off at the massive end than either the  or sph models .    in summary ,",
    "our comparisons demonstrate a higher level of consistency than was perhaps expected between the results of sph simulations and the more idealized semi - analytic models",
    ". a particularly uncertain component of the semi - analytic treatment is the assumption that gas cools from a quasi - equilibrium state established when the gas is shock - heated to the virial temperature of a halo during collapse .",
    "our comparisons do not test this assumption directly , only its net effect on the amount of gas that cools .",
    "globally , this turns out to be very similar to the sph result .",
    "however , the semi - analytic model tends to produce somewhat less cool gas in massive halos than the sph simulation , particularly in the @xmath2cdm cosmology .",
    "we stress that due to the limited resolution of our sph simulations , our conclusions are restricted to massive galaxies , with baryonic mass of @xmath124",

    "<S> we compare the statistical properties of galaxies found in two different models of hierarchical galaxy formation : the semi - analytic model of cole et al . and the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations of pearce et al . </S>",
    "<S> these two techniques model gas processes very differently : by approximate , analytic methods in the case of the semi - analytic model , and by direct numerical integration of the equations of hydrodynamics for a set of discrete particles in the case of sph . using a ` stripped - down ' version of the semi - analytic model which mimics </S>",
    "<S> the resolution of the sph simulations and excludes physical processes not included in them , we find that the two models produce an ensemble of galaxies with remarkably similar properties , although there are some differences in the gas cooling rates and in the number of galaxies that populate halos of different mass . </S>",
    "<S> the full semi - analytic model , which has effectively no resolution limit and includes a treatment of star formation and supernovae feedback , produces somewhat different ( but readily understandable ) results . </S>",
    "<S> our comparison demonstrates that , on the whole , sph simulations and semi - analytic models give similar results for the thermodynamic evolution of cooling gas in cosmological volumes . </S>",
    "<S> agreement is particularly good for the present - day global fractions of hot gas , cold dense ( i.e. galactic ) gas and uncollapsed gas , for which the sph and stripped - down semi - analytic calculations differ by at most 25% . in the most massive halos , </S>",
    "<S> the stripped - down semi - analytic model predicts , on the whole , up to 50% less gas in galaxies than is seen in the sph simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the two techniques apportion this cold gas somewhat differently amongst galaxies in a given halo . </S>",
    "<S> this difference can be tracked down to the greater cooling rate in massive halos in the sph simulation compared to the semi - analytic model . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxy correlation functions in the two models agree to better than about 50% over most pair separations and evolve with redshift in very similar ways . </S>",
    "<S> our comparison demonstrates that these different techniques for modelling galaxy formation produce results that are broadly consistent with each other and highlights areas where further study is required .    </S>",
    "<S> methods : numerical - galaxies : formation : kinematics and dynamics - cosmology : theory - hydrodynamical simulation </S>"
