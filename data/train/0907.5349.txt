    "the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite has been extremely successful in describing a wide range of mean - field features for experiments with bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) . in particular , the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation @xcite , where the kinetic energy is neglected , has been very rewarding @xcite .",
    "this approximation holds for repulsive condensates with positive scattering length @xmath0 and large particle numbers . in the regime of validity of the tf approximation",
    ", the total energy is distributed between interaction energy and potential energy from the confining trap , while the kinetic energy becomes negligible .",
    "because of the non - linear nature of the gp equation , it is only solved analytically in a few cases , e.g. , vortices and solitons in homogeneous condensates @xcite .",
    "the tf solution is also analytical , although it only holds in the bulk of the condensate . at the surface",
    "the approximation breaks down and is usually patched by including the kinetic energy at the surface @xcite .",
    "the interactions of the ordinary gp equation are based on the lowest order zero - range potential , which is governed by the scattering length alone .",
    "although this approximation is usually very good , the higher - order corrections to the scattering dynamics @xcite can be crucial in certain cases , e.g. , for rydberg molecules embedded in becs @xcite and for narrow feshbach resonances @xcite .",

    "we assume that the condensate can be described by the gp equation .",
    "since we are interested in the ultracold regime , where the temperature is much smaller than the critical temperature for condensation , we adopt the formalism . in order to include higher - order effects in the two - body scattering dynamics",

    "we assume an isotropic trap , @xmath8 , and introduce the trap length @xmath9 . the single - particle density , @xmath10 , is normalized to the particle number , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the chemical potential .",

    ", one assumes that @xmath20 and @xmath24 vanishes at infinity , drops the boundary terms , and eq .",
    "is obtained by varying @xmath25 .",
    "however , the existence of these surface terms is essential for the inclusion of higher - order interactions as discussed below .    in the rest of this paper we use trap units , @xmath26 ,",

    "let us briefly review the standard thomas - fermi approximation @xcite . neglecting the kinetic - energy term , as compared to the trap and interaction energies , the gp equation has the solution @xmath32 with chemical potential @xmath33 .",
    "this solution is used out to the surface , @xmath34 , while outside @xmath35 .",
    "the normalization and surface condition @xmath36 give @xmath37 the total energy becomes @xmath38 the trap and interaction energies are @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",

    "we now consider the boundary terms in eq .  .",
    "above , we assumed that @xmath61 at some finite radius @xmath59 which we identify as the condensate size .",
    "however , only the first two boundary terms in eq .",
    "vanish on account of this condition .",
    "for the last term in eq .   to vanish we need @xmath62 , which implies that @xmath63 notice that this latter derivative is in fact non - zero in the @xmath64 case , which is the root of the divergence of the kinetic energy at the condensate surface as we discuss later .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : surface - derivative ] ) gives a closed expression for the remaining free parameter @xmath52 , @xmath65    this additional requirement on the derivative at the edge of the condensate implies that higher - order terms require a smoothing at the surface of the cloud . in addition , the discussion of which kinetic operator structure to use ( @xmath66 or @xmath67 @xcite ) is obsolete in our treatment since the boundary term @xmath68 vanishes . in this sense",
    "the inclusion of a higher - order term neatly removes some of the difficulties of the traditional tf treatment .",
    "the solutions with a finite boundary @xmath54 of the modified gp equation only minimize the energy functional if eq",
    ".   holds .",
    "we note that extremal states of the energy functional always satisfy the virial theorem .",
    "thus , enforcing the virial theorem on the gp solutions is equivalent to eq .  .",
    "we show in the appendix that the virial theorem approach also leads to eq .  .",
    "we now determine the condensate size @xmath54 and chemical potential @xmath12 .",
    "the normalization condition is @xmath69 while the surface condition reads @xmath70 combining eq",
    ".  - gives @xmath71 which determines @xmath54 for given @xmath72 and @xmath31 , and upon back - substitution also @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath73 case can be worked out analogously by replacing trigonometric functions with hyperbolics and keeping track of signs .",
    "the two cases can in fact be combined into one equation @xmath74    this equation determines @xmath75 implicitly as function of @xmath76 . the result is shown in fig .  [ fig - rmax ] .",
    "we notice that in principle , @xmath54 becomes a multi - valued function . however , all the higher solutions for @xmath47 [ dotted in fig .  [ fig - rmax ] ] are spurious , since the density becomes negative on one or more intervals inside @xmath54 . the non - spurious solutions [ solid line in fig .  [ fig - rmax ] ] define @xmath54 as a single - valued function of @xmath0 and @xmath31 , which was not guaranteed a priori .",
    "the four quadrants in fig .",
    "[ fig - rmax ] correspond to the different sign combinations of @xmath0 and @xmath31 .",
    "the sign of the extra interaction energy , @xmath18 , is determined by @xmath77 . for a typical concave density",
    ", the laplacian term will be negative .",
    "we therefore see that for @xmath78 , the higher - order interaction is attractive , whereas for @xmath79 , it is repulsive .",
    "the tf solution only exists for @xmath79 .",
    "we discuss both cases separately below .      for @xmath80 , @xmath73 [ third quadrant in fig .",
    "[ fig - rmax ] ] there are no solutions , which is expected since the normal tf approximation has no solutions for @xmath80 as the interaction energy @xmath17 is negative and the kinetic energy that could prevent collapse is neglected .",
    "the @xmath47 , @xmath42 case in the first quadrant has only spurious solutions . here",
    "the @xmath31 term is attractive for the typical concave density and a collapse towards a high - density state is possible in complete analogy to the usual discussion of attractively interacting condensates within the standard gp theory .",
    "whereas there can be metastable states at large values of @xmath81 , these are stabilized by kinetic energy and thus are not present in our tf approach .",
    "thus , even when the total kinetic energy is small , it is still needed to prevent the attractive higher - order term from amplifying local - density variations .",
    "this important point can also be established by considering the stability of the homogeneous condensate through linearization of the gp equation . by repeating the analysis of @xcite with the higher - order term",
    ", we find that for @xmath47 and @xmath42 , the kinetic - energy term is crucial for the stability of the excitation modes .",
    "in fact , exponentially growing modes will always be present if the kinetic energy is neglected .",
    "this will be discussed elsewhere in relation to the numerical solution of the full gp equation @xcite .      for @xmath73 , @xmath42",
    "a single solution ( a ) exists . this was expected since @xmath82 gives extra stability .",
    "the solution approaches the normal tf result in eq .",
    "when @xmath83 , as can also be seen from eq .",
    "of course in this limit @xmath84 .",
    "however , the @xmath85 term in eq .   implies that the convergence to the normal tf solution is only on a relative scale and is better represented on a logarithmic scale as in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig - rmax ] .    for @xmath47 ,",
    "@xmath80 there is a single solution ( b ) which connects smoothly to the ( a ) solution . in the limit @xmath86 , which is determined by @xmath87",
    ", we find @xmath88 .",
    "this solution is possible when the @xmath31 term provides just enough repulsion to cancel the usual @xmath80 collapse behavior .      in fig .",
    "[ fig - mu ] we show the chemical potential for the smoothly connecting solutions ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "again we see that ( a ) approaches the normal tf limit for large @xmath89 . here , it is interesting to note how @xmath12 turns around near the origin [ amplified in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig - mu ] ] and maintains a positive value .",
    "this occurs in the region where the lowest - order interaction gives a large negative - energy contribution which the @xmath31 term is still able to balance yielding a well - defined tf solution .",
    "this behavior is analogous to the balancing of attraction by the kinetic term in the usual @xmath90 case @xcite . as @xmath0 becomes increasingly negative , so too does @xmath12 and collapse is inevitable ( and likewise when @xmath91 ) .",
    "with @xmath54 and @xmath12 determined , we can find the density profile , energy densities and integrated energy contributions . with eq .",
    ", the energy densities are given by @xmath92 using eq .",
    ", the total energy density ( without @xmath93 ) becomes @xmath94    in fig .",
    "[ fig - dens - a ] , we show the density profile of the ( a ) solutions for @xmath95 and selected @xmath73 .",
    "we clearly see that the higher - order term tends to expand the condensate through its repulsion .",
    "importantly , at the boundary , there is a smoothing caused by the condition in eq .",
    "[ see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig - dens - a ] ] . we will discuss how this affects the estimated kinetic energy in the next section .",
    "as @xmath96 grows , we see the condensate flatten and in the limit of very large @xmath96 , it becomes a constant density .",
    "figure  [ fig - dens - b ] displays the density profile for the ( b ) solutions with @xmath80 for selected @xmath47 . here",
    ", we see the profile collapse toward the expected delta - function with decreasing @xmath31 . it is interesting to follow the ( a ) solution through the origin in fig .",
    "[ fig - rmax ] and onto solution branch ( b ) , passing from @xmath97 to @xmath98 . on the ( a ) branch",
    ", the solution flattens as @xmath31 decreases and eventually becomes effectively constant in space .",
    "this is also true for the ( b ) branch at @xmath98 , and as @xmath31 is decreased , the solution proceeds to shrink as the @xmath31 term becomes unable to provide the repulsion needed to prevent the @xmath80 collapse induced by the lowest - order term .    from the figures",
    ", we see that large @xmath96 induces large changes in cloud size . as the condensate",
    "can be imaged with very good resolution @xcite , this should be measurable if the regime of large @xmath96 can be accessed .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we now discuss the energy contributions which are interesting since the release energies are in fact measurable quantities @xcite . since we neglect the kinetic term in the tf approximation , the release energy is simply @xmath99 . in tab .",
    "[ tab : data ] , we give the integrated energy contributions for some relevant values of @xmath31 calculated for @xmath100 , whereas fig .  [ fig - energy ] gives the energies as function of @xmath101 .",
    "we note that for smaller values of @xmath102 , the same overall behavior is found , however , the kinetic term is more important and the tf approximation becomes worse .",
    "we observe that @xmath103 grows towards the @xmath104 point .",
    "this is due to the trap energy increasing as the density flattens [ @xmath16 diverges around the origin in fig .",
    "[ fig - energy ] ] .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath91 the energy diverges toward @xmath105 as the collapse sets in [ @xmath17 diverges on the @xmath47 side in fig .",
    "[ fig - energy ] ] .",
    "the boundary where the energy vanishes is around @xmath106 for @xmath100 , but this depends on the choice of @xmath102 . with respect to the release energy",
    ", we find that somewhere in the region @xmath107 , @xmath108 becomes negative .",
    "this is a result of the unavoidable collapse , and also indicates that kinetic energy can not be ignored at this point .",
    "notice , however , that the release energy changes considerably and could provide a way to measure the influence of the @xmath31 term .",
    "we now address the validity of the tf approximation with the @xmath31 term included . in order to do so , we must consider the contribution of the kinetic energy .",
    "the kinetic energy density can be written as @xmath109 strictly speaking , this is not the true kinetic energy , since the kinetic terms were neglected from the start",
    ". however eqs .   and can be used to test whether the tf approximation holds locally , i.e. , @xmath110 should hold for the solution @xmath57 to be consistent . in tab .",
    "[ tab : data ] , we calculate the integrated contribution of the kinetic energy relative to the total tf energy and we find that the contribution is small everywhere except the point where @xmath111 on the @xmath47 side of fig .",
    "[ fig - energy ] . here , the kinetic energy is of course the most important term and the tf approximation is poor .    in the standard",
    "tf , the kinetic energy causes trouble at the boundary of the cloud . here ,",
    "@xmath112 and since the density vanishes and the derivative is finite [ see eq .",
    "[ eq : density - tf ] ] , this diverges at @xmath34 . when including the higher - order term we need to use the additional boundary condition @xmath113 at @xmath54 , so the kinetic energy will be strictly zero at @xmath54 .",
    "however , as one approaches the boundary , the kinetic - energy density grows rapidly before it descends towards zero within a very small interval at @xmath54 . the total energy density in eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy - dens ] ) goes to zero at this point and we find that @xmath114 is very large near the boundary as in the usual @xmath64 case .    we conclude that the inclusion of the higher - order term does not alleviate the difficulties with kinetic energy at the boundary .",
    "the techniques for addressing this problem described in @xcite should therefore be generalized to include the higher - order interaction term in order to improve the description at the boundary of the cloud .",
    "the considerations above show that deviations from the usual tf approximation can be strong when @xmath31 is large . in the following ,",
    "we reintroduce explicit units for comparison with real systems .",
    "we have to consider @xmath115 .",
    "of course , the @xmath116 factor means that this quantity is generally very small since @xmath31 is of order @xmath117 and @xmath30 is of order @xmath118 .",
    "we first consider some typical background values for bosonic alkali atoms away from resonance .",
    "we estimate the effective range to be the of order of the potential range and assuming a van der waals interaction , we have @xmath119 . for typical one - component gases we have @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "since @xmath5 , we see that the @xmath121 term will dominate and in all cases @xmath122 . in trap units , this becomes @xmath123 .",
    "in typical traps of @xmath124 , the higher - order term is therefore very small .",
    "these values also predominantly lie in the first quadrant of fig .",
    "[ fig - rmax ] and thus no tf solution exists .",
    "let us first consider feshbach resonances in order to increase the influence of the @xmath31 term .",
    "we use a multi - channel feshbach model @xcite , which describes the full t matrix as a function of resonance position @xmath125 , width @xmath126 , magnetic - moment difference between the channels @xmath127 , and the background scattering length @xmath128 . performing an effective - range expansion @xcite",

    "even so , the effective - range corrections near zero - crossing obtained are in fact identical to those obtained from use of the full t - matrix @xcite .",
    "one finds @xmath136 , where @xmath137 .    as a concrete example",
    ", we consider the alkali isotope @xmath138k where several feshbach resonances of vastly different widths were found recently @xcite .",
    "first , we focus on zero - crossing and consider the very narrow resonance at @xmath139 g with @xmath140 g , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 .",
    "we obtain @xmath143 and @xmath144 for @xmath145 .",
    "it is important to notice that @xmath78 around @xmath146 .",
    "this means that we are looking for solutions in the first and third quadrants of fig .",
    "[ fig - rmax ] and again we have to conclude that no tf solutions can be found when higher - order terms are taken into account .    another case of interest is around resonance where @xmath147 . here , we have @xmath148 and @xmath149 on both sides of the resonance .",
    "thus , the @xmath42 side will be in the first and the @xmath80 in the second quadrant of fig .",
    "[ fig - rmax ] .",
    "this makes it difficult to imagine sweeping the resonance from either side to probe the solutions on branch ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig - rmax ] .",
    "one could imagine starting on the @xmath42 side with small @xmath47 .",
    "the full gp equation will have perfectly sensible solution here , however , when one approaches the resonance the @xmath31 term will diverge and induce collapse already on the @xmath42 side .",
    "if we approach from the @xmath80 side , then we face the problem that the critical number of particles decreases dramatically before @xmath31 grows sufficiently and one therefore needs a very small condensate since @xmath150 @xcite . at this point ,",
    "the tf approximation is no longer valid .",
    "the feshbach resonance used to increase @xmath31 must be very narrow in order for @xmath151 to be large .",
    "however , most experimentally known resonances are not narrow . for broad or intermediate resonances",
    ", we have to consider the long - range van der waals interaction when calculating the effective - range corrections .",
    "analytic formulas for this case have been worked out in @xcite , and we note that the effective range diverges as @xmath152 near zero crossing exactly as in the feshbach model above . for very narrow resonances",
    ", we still have @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the characteristic length of the van der waals interaction . the model above should thus give the dominant contribution .",

    "we have explicitly introduced the oscillator length which is the relevant length scale of comparison .",
    "importantly , we find that @xmath79 for @xmath42 and we are thus in the fourth quadrant where a tf solution exists . for @xmath80 , we pass to the second quadrant as @xmath31 becomes positive and a single collapsed solution can be found .",
    "we now estimate the parameters obtained from the van der waals formulas . with @xmath159 m and @xmath160 @xcite , we have @xmath161 .",
    "we thus have @xmath162 . for values of @xmath0 that are not extremely small , the solution is therefore typically located far to the right in fig .",
    "[ fig - rmax ] where it will look similar to the @xmath64 case .",
    "we can estimate how close to zero one would have to tune @xmath0 in order to see deviations using the @xmath145 limit of the van der waals effective range .",

    "observing the effect of the @xmath31 term therefore seems out of reach at the moment , but might be possible in the near future . of course , we still have to maintain a large value of @xmath72 for kinetic energy to be small , and thus a larger condensate is needed close to zero crossing .    from the examples above",
    ", we see problems in accessing the tf solutions presented above in current experiments with ultracold alkali gases .",
    "in particular , we notice that realistic systems which have been used for creation of becs in alkali - metal gases for the last decades have parameters that predominantly lie in the first quadrant of fig .",
    "[ fig - rmax ]",
    ". as we have discussed , there are no well - defined tf solutions in that region .",
    "therefore , we see that the kinetic energy plays a decisive role and we are forced to consider it in principle , even if it is small for all practical purposes .",
    "the physical reason is that for @xmath42 and @xmath47 , the higher - order interaction is effectively attractive and induces collapse which will have to be balanced by a barrier from the kinetic term , similar to the @xmath80 , @xmath64 case @xcite .",
    "since we neglect the kinetic term in the tf approximation , we should not expect to find solutions in the @xmath78 case .    only in the case of resonances dominated by the long - range van der waals interaction",
    "do the parameters allow for tf solutions with non - zero @xmath31 .",
    "however , here the length scale of the trap makes the contribution very small and the tf solution becomes identical to the @xmath31 case .",
    "one could in principle tune @xmath0 very close to zero - crossing and obtain a significant contribution but the level of tuning required is beyond current experimental reach .",
    "we have considered the effect of higher - order interactions in bose - einstein condensates within the gross - pitaevskii theory .",
    "we derived the gp equation with effective - range corrections included and solved it analytically in the thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "higher - order interaction terms act as derivatives on the condensate wave function which means that the boundary conditions on the solutions of the gp equation must be carefully considered .",
    "we then discussed the solutions for various parameters and presented the chemical potential , density profiles , and the energy contributions .",
    "we find that no tf solutions are possible when the higher - order term is attractive .",
    "this conclusion holds both in the trapped system and in the homogeneous case @xcite .",
    "an estimate of the relevant parameters for alkali atoms showed that away from resonances , they typically lie in the region where the effective - range correction is effectively attractive and likewise near very narrow feshbach resonances .",
    "we conclude that in those cases , the kinetic energy , even if very small , is crucial in order to stabilize collapse due to higher - order interaction terms . for broader resonances where the long - range van der waals potential is dominant , we find that modified tf solutions exits . however , for typical traps , the parameters are very small and tuning of the scattering length near zero crossing at a level beyond current experimental reach is necessary .",

    "even though eq",
