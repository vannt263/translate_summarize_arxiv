    "in order to introduce @xmath21 formally , let @xmath24 represent the state of the system at ( discrete ) time @xmath25 .",
    "the vector @xmath24is defined in the compound hilbert space @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the hilbert spaces for the lattice sites and coin qubit , respectively . with @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    "spanned by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , we can write @xmath31 with @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the probability amplitude for the walker to be at site @xmath34 at time @xmath25 with the coin in state @xmath35 . the probability of finding the walker at site @xmath36 at time @xmath25 is @xmath37 .",
    "the state evolves as @xmath38 , with @xmath39 a unitary operator . here ,",
    "operator @xmath40 is the _ coin operator _ , acting only in @xmath28 , whose more general form is @xmath41 with @xmath42 arbitrary reals and @xmath43 ( notice that , for @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath40 is just the hadamard transformation ) .",
    "@xmath46 is the conditional displacement operator along direction @xmath47 , which we write as @xmath48 $ ] , where @xmath49 is the unit vector along direction @xmath47 .",
    "equation @xmath50 can be expressed as a map relating probability amplitudes @xmath51 with @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are nearest neighbors of @xmath36 .",
    "this map admits two plane - wave solutions of the form @xmath55   $ ] , where @xmath56  are time independent vectors , @xmath57 is the pseudo - momentum with @xmath58   $ ] , and @xmath59 are two frequencies determined by the dispersion relation .",
    "the dispersion relation is most relevant because @xmath60 is entirely determined by it , given @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , when the initial state extends over a finite set of points in the lattice , especially when it is modulated by a _ smooth _ function of space , the dispersion relation is particularly useful for predicting the evolution of the initial wave packet , due to the relatively well - defined group velocity ( given by the local gradient of the dispersion relation curve ) . in this case ,",
    "long - wavelength continuous approximations are very well suited and useful for envisaging the long time behavior of the probability distribution .",
    "this has been discussed in detail for @xmath8 in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    ", we will limit ourselves to a qualitative discussion of what the dispersion relation suggests for cases @xmath22 .",
    "let us first consider @xmath62 . by proceeding as stated above ,",
    "one obtains the following dispersion relation : @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "notice that phase @xmath69 does not appear in eq .",
    "( [ disp(2 ) ] ) ; hence it is irrelevant . as for the phases that do appear , they just entail a translation of the frequency and spatial quasi - momentum . only @xmath70 and @xmath71 are dynamically relevant parameters .",
    "figure [ fig1](a ) presents the dispersion curves for @xmath72 .",
    "the most relevant features are the existence of a number of saddle - points ( for which the group velocity is zero ) , together with regions of maximum slope ( which equals 0.5 , hence the maximum velocity in @xmath73 ) and , most importantly , the existence of dps .",
    "interestingly , when @xmath74 , the dps disappear , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "this suggests that the existence of dps could be particularly sensitive to decoherence effects in the coin mechanism .",
    "the dynamics around the points of null and maximum slope can be analyzed as in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath8 , i.e. , in terms of known solutions of simple linear wave equations .",
    "one can then envisage more or less straightforward generalizations of the results there discussed to the two - dimensional case ( we study this elsewhere for grover-@xmath73 @xcite ) .",
    "but the existence of dps is particularly appealing and constitutes a qualitative difference with the one - dimensional case .",
    "this geometric object , the dp ( that takes its name from the diabolo - like shape of the conical intersection ) , appears in physics in quite different contexts such as , for instance , quantum triangular billiards @xcite , conical refraction in crystal optics @xcite , the electronic spectrum of polyatomic molecules @xcite , or the dispersion relations for massless fermions ( dirac electrons ) in qed and for electrons in graphene @xcite or optical lattices @xcite .",
    "the diabolo is associated with some remarkable phenomena appearing in those systems . _ as for a given initial condition the dispersion relation determines the evolution of the system ( in the absence of dissipation ) , the existence of dps establishes a strong link between the evolution properties in these contexts_. let us remark the fact that the quantum walk , differently from the continuous systems mentioned above , is defined in a discrete hilbert space .    for what we have stated so far",
    ", we can expect to find in the dynamics of @xmath73 some parallelism with phenomena present in the aforementioned systems . in this sense , fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) shows the propagation of an initially extended state [ with a gaussian probability distribution of @xmath75 and coin state @xmath76 equal for all populated sites ] after @xmath77 time steps .",
    "a homogeneous ballistic propagation from the origin with perfect circular symmetry is clearly visible , which strongly recalls the ring shape of the beam exiting a biaxial crystal under conical refraction conditions @xcite .",
    "indeed a careful analysis reveals that the fine structure of the probability distribution in fig .",
    "1(c ) is very similar to that appearing in conical refraction ( the so - called pogendorf rings @xcite ) , a result to be reported elsewhere with full mathematical details @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare this dynamics with that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) , which has been obtained for the same initial conditions but with @xmath78 . in this case",
    "the diabolo is lost and the branches of the dispersion relation show a parabolic shape [ see fig . [ fig1](b ) ] that leads to evolutions typical of linear optical diffraction @xcite .",
    "we want to mention that a similar controlled disappearance of the dp has been experimentally observed in graphene @xcite .    before moving to a higher dimension ,",
    "let us revisit the relation between @xmath62 and grover-@xmath15 from the dispersion relation perspective .",
    "the dispersion relation for grover-@xmath15 consists of four sheets , because the coin space is four - dimensional , and can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in our notation",
    ", they read @xmath79 and @xmath80   $ ] .",
    "remarkably , the two sheets @xmath81 coincide with those of @xmath73 [ eq .",
    "( [ disp(2 ) ] ) ] for @xmath82 after identifying @xmath83 in grover-@xmath16 with @xmath84 in @xmath73 , i.e. , the two dispersion relations coincide for these parameters up to a @xmath85 rotation of the pseudo - momentum . the two other roots in grover-@xmath86 , @xmath79 ,",
    "are constant , which means that the projections of the initial state onto the corresponding eigenvectors will not evolve in time .",
    "this is the origin of localization in grover-@xmath87 for most initial coin states , as already noticed in ref .",
    "we conclude that , whenever the initial state in grover-@xmath88 does not project onto the eigenvectors governed by @xmath89 , grover-@xmath16 and @xmath90 are isomorphous for @xmath82 .",
    "this is our proof of the ( partial ) equivalence between the two versions of the process .",
    "let us now move to @xmath23 .",
    "the dispersion relation is governed by @xmath91   \\nonumber\\\\ &   + s_{1}\\left [   c_{2}s_{3}\\sin\\left (   u\\!+\\!v\\!-\\!w\\right )   -s_{2}c_{3}\\sin\\left ( u\\!-\\!v\\!-\\!w\\right )   \\right ]   , \\label{disp3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "here @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 from eq . ( [ disp3 ] )",
    "two dispersion relations are obtained , namely @xmath99 and @xmath100 . as in @xmath90 ,",
    "some phases in @xmath40 are absent in the dispersion relation ( hence they are irrelevant ) and the effect of the rest of phases in @xmath40 is just a displacement of the dispersion relation surfaces in the @xmath101 space . equation ( [ disp3 ] ) is simpler for @xmath102 , @xmath103 . in this case",
    "there are eight degeneracies ( occurring when @xmath104 ) at @xmath105 , with @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "these are the three - dimensional ( 3d ) equivalents of the dps discussed for @xmath62 . as in @xmath62 ,",
    "the dps disappear when phases @xmath108 are different .",
    "we mention that several crystallographic structures have recently been proposed for obtaining 3d dps ( dirac - semimetal in 3d ) @xcite .    in figs . [ fig2](a ) and 2(b ) we present two bidimensional projections of the probability distribution corresponding to the propagation of a walker initially localized at the origin .",
    "the width of the distribution grows linearly with time , along all three spatial dimensions , as it happens for lower dimensionality . in order to show the effect of the dp , figs . [",
    "fig2](c ) and 2(d ) show the same projections as figs . [",
    "fig2](a ) and 2(b ) when the initial condition of the walker is not localized but extended .",
    "again we choose a gaussian distribution with @xmath75 , whose pseudo - momentum is centered at one of the dps [ @xmath109 .",
    "we observe a symmetric ballistic dynamics in the @xmath110 plane [ fig . [ fig2](c ) ] that resembles that of fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) .",
    "notice the existence of two concentric bright rings , as it occurs in conical refraction @xcite .",
    "however , the probability is not equally symmetric in the @xmath111 plane [ fig . [ fig2](d ) ] which reveals an intrinsic lack of symmetry in @xmath112 : indeed , it can be shown that it is not possible to find any initial coin state that leads to a symmetric propagation in all directions [ the chosen initial coin state , @xmath113 for all populated sites , leads to a symmetric distribution in the planes with constant @xmath114 , but not in those for which @xmath114 varies , as the figures show ] .",
    "one could wonder whether @xmath112 is a process similar to grover-@xmath115 as it happens for @xmath116 .",
    "the answer is negative : we have derived and compared the dispersion relations of both processes for @xmath117 and they are different .",
    "hence @xmath116 is a singular case in this respect .",
    "another aspect investigated in the context of two - dimensional quantum walks is the generation and the effects of bipartite entanglement during their evolution @xcite . having a richer and more complex structure than the bipartite case @xcite , multipartite entanglement",
    "has recently attracted a lot of interest in the scientific community .",
    "clearly , a feasible system able to generate a proper amount of genuine multipartite entanglement could be a valuable benchmark for this rapidly growing research field .",
    "hence a most relevant question is whether quantum walks with @xmath118 do exhibit considerable genuine multipartite entanglement or not .",
    "we have investigated this for @xmath117 .",
    "we have first to trace out the state of the coin , and we are then left with a density matrix in the composite hilbert space @xmath119 ( each subspace corresponding to a direction of the walk ) .",
    "we evaluate the multipartite entanglement present in this composite system by means of the tripartite negativity @xcite .",
    "this is defined as the geometric average of the three negativities that are obtained by considering the three possible bipartitions of the total system , giving @xmath120{n_{1 - 23}n_{2 - 13}n_{3 - 12}}$ ] . here",
    "@xmath121 is the negativity of the composite system @xmath122 corresponding to the bipartition in the subsystem @xmath123 and the subsystem @xmath124 .",
    "each hilbert direction - subspace has a dimension growing with the number of time steps , so we use the generalization of the negativity for higher - dimensional systems ( so as to have @xmath125 ) @xcite .",
    "we have calculated @xmath126 in @xmath112 , with the walker starting at the origin and initial coin state @xmath76 , for a number of time steps @xmath25 up to 10 , obtaining the plot in fig . [ fig2](e ) . even if the number of time steps considered here is not so large ( due to the dimension of the total hilbert space , the computational power required for the evaluation grows rapidly with @xmath25 ) , it is easy to check that @xmath112 is able to generate a considerable amount of genuine multipartite entanglement .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that @xmath126 saturates rather fast .",
    "let us finally discuss the implementability of @xmath127 . realizing @xmath7 is quite demanding because of the complexity of performing coin operators to transform the needed @xmath10-dimensional qudit . on the other hand , in @xmath127 : ( i )",
    "a single coin qubit is required independently of @xmath128 ; ( ii ) two - dimensional transformations of the qubit are easy to implement @xcite ; and ( iii ) the sequential application of operators @xmath129 , @xmath130 , makes the implementation of @xmath127 similar to that of @xmath6 , provided that all @xmath0 dimensions could be multiplexed into a single one ( similarly to what schreiber _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have recently done in their pioneering implementation of @xmath15 ) .",
    "indeed , one could even implement @xmath127 with a constant number of physical elements independently of @xmath0 if there is sufficient control on the experimental device .    in order to illustrate this",
    ", we generalize the idealized device already discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which is similar to that actually used in ref .",
    "consider a long enough optical cavity containing two electro - optic modulators ( eoms ) whose roles are ( i ) eom1 performs the coin operator @xmath131 ( i.e. , makes a unitary transformation of the light polarization state , which plays the role of the coin - qubit in this implementation of the walk ) ; and ( ii ) eom2 performs the conditional displacement @xmath132 , which consists in up / down shifting the carrier frequency of the light pulse depending on its polarization .",
    "the light pulses entering the cavity are assumed to be much shorter than the cavity length , and the frequency shifts introduced by eom2 must be large enough for avoiding any frequency overlapping between pulses .",
    "with such a device not only @xmath6 can be implemented  see refs .",
    "@xcite  but also @xmath127 could be implemented for different values of @xmath0 by properly programming the operations of the eoms , without the need for additional elements .",
    "for example , in order to perform @xmath133 , the first half of the time step is implemented within one cavity round trip of the light pulse ( during which eom1 and eom2 implement @xmath134 ) ; then , in the subsequent cavity round trip , the settings of both eoms are changed in order to perform a different coin operator and a different frequency displacement implementing @xmath135 .",
    "importantly , the frequency displacements in @xmath136 and @xmath137 must be different enough in order to multiplex a large number of steps @xcite .",
    "only technical limitations seem to restrain the extension of the procedure to higher @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , we are not claiming that the device just outlined is the most appropriate for implementing @xmath127 .",
    "indeed , a suitable modification of the flexible device used by schreiber _",
    "et al_. @xcite would probably be a more promising option . with our discussion",
    "we just want to emphasize that a single and conceptually simple device _ could _ implement alternate quantum walks with tunable dimensionality .",
    "in conclusion , we have introduced the @xmath0-dimensional alternate quantum walk and discussed some of its properties through the analysis of the dispersion relation that reveals , in particular , the existence of diabolical points .",
    "we have demonstrated that , for @xmath117 , the process generates genuine multipartite entanglement .",
    "we have finally discussed its implementability , that could be possible with physical resources that do not necessarily grow with the dimensionality of the walk .",
