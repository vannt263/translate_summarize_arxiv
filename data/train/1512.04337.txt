    "it is noteworthy that the thermodynamical phenomenological implications of gup in quantum gases are numerous , for example @xcite .",
    "in@xcite the quantum gravity influences on the statistic properties classical non - relativistic , ultra - relativistic and photon gases were addressed .",

    "it is found that there is a quantum gravity correction depends on the number density of the star leads to an increase in the mass of the star and the quantum gravity tends to resist the collapse of the star .",
    "the other configuration is that the star is almost composed of ultra - relativistic particles .",
    "they found that the increase in the star energy leads to monotonically blows up of fermi pressure which resists the gravitational collapse .",
