    "the discovery of evidence for live @xmath0al ( half - life of @xmath7 yr ) at the time of the formation of refractory inclusions in the allende meteorite ( lee et al . 1976 ) led quickly to the suggestion that the @xmath0al was synthesized in a supernova , then transported by the supernova s shock wave to a dense molecular cloud , where the shock wave triggered the collapse of a cloud core and injected the @xmath0al into the collapsing presolar cloud ( cameron and truran 1977 ) .",
    "detailed numerical calculations showed that such simultaneous triggering and injection was possible , provided that the shock wave had slowed to speeds of @xmath8 10 to @xmath8 40 km / sec ( boss 1995 ; foster & boss 1996 , 1997 ) and that the shock wave and cloud were effectively isothermal at @xmath8 10 k. this isothermal assumption is appropriate for the radiative phase of a supernova shock ( chevalier 1974 ) , which occurs when the shock has travelled @xmath8 10 pc and swept up a cool shell of gas and dust .",
    "recent adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) studies ( nakamura et al .",
    "2006 ; melioli et al .",
    "2006 ) have shown that shock - triggered star formation is likely to occur when the supernova shock has evolved into a radiative shock , i.e. , the shock wave is able to cool so rapidly by radiation that the shock wave is effectively at the same temperature as the ambient medium , confirming the results of boss ( 1995 ) and foster & boss ( 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "vanhala & cameron ( 1998 ; hereafter vc ) used a smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code and detailed equations of state to confirm the previous results for isothermal shocks and clouds .",
    "however , when vc allowed their models to become nonisothermal by including compressional heating and molecular , atomic , and dust cooling , they found that they could not achieve simultaneous triggering of cloud collapse and injection of shock wave material , raising serious doubts about the supernova trigger hypothesis .",
    "alternative explanations for the origin of the slri in chondritic meteorites have also arisen .",
    "shu et al . ( 1997 ) suggested that the slri were produced _ in situ _ by spallation reactions involving energetic particles emanating from protosolar flares striking dust grains near the x - wind point , from whence the grains would be lofted upward by the x - wind and transported outward to the solar nebula .",
    "however , the slri @xmath1fe can not be produced by spallation , and requires a stellar nucleosynthetic source ( tachibana & huss 2003 ) such as a supernova . the fact that the results of @xmath0al dating agree well with the independent pb - pb dating system ( connelly et al .",
    "2008 ) implies that the @xmath0al was spatially homogeneous in the solar nebula , which is inconsistent with the bulk of its production by spallation reactions at the x - wind point .",
    "regardless of whether spallation reactions contributed to the slri inventory , then , a supernova source for the @xmath0al and @xmath1fe appears to be necessary .",
    "given a supernova origin for the @xmath0al and @xmath1fe , it has also been suggested that a nearby ( @xmath8 0.1 pc ) supernova may have injected these slri into the already - formed solar nebula ( ouellette , desch & hester 2007 ) . while such hot shock front gas is unable to penetrate into the much denser disk gas ( chevalier 2000 ) , ouellette et al . ( 2007 ) suggested that slri residing in dust grains micron - sized and larger shot through the stalled shock - wave gas and into the disk .",
    "however , supernova dust grains are essentially all smaller than 0.1 micron , and are sputtered to even smaller sizes in the shock ( bianchi & schneider 2007 ) .",
    "gounelle & meibom ( 2008 ) noted that disks formed within @xmath8 0.3 pc of a massive star would be photoevaporated away prior to its supernova explosion .",
    "furthermore , krot et al . ( 2008 ) argued that injection into a late - phase solar nebula would have led to the injection of stable oxygen isotopes as well as slri into the disk , leading to an oxygen isotope distribution that would be inconsistent with the observed values and their explanation by mass - independent fractionation .",
    "krot et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and thrane et al .",
    "( 2008 ) argued that injection must have occurred instead into the presolar cloud , so that the sun and the solar nebula shared a common reservoir of oxygen isotopes .",
    "here we return to the question of whether nonisothermal shock fronts are fatal for the supernova triggering hypothesis , by using the flash2.5 amr code and an improved cooling law to reinvestigate this basic question of solar system origin .",
    "flash employs a block - structured adaptive grid approach .",
    "advection is handled by the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) , featuring a riemann solver at cell boundaries that handles shock fronts exceptionally well .",
    "we downloaded and ran the flash2.5 amr code ( flash.uchicago.edu/website/home ) on several of the flash - supplied test problems relevant to shock - triggered star formation , namely the sod shock tube problem and the gravitational collapse of a pressureless cloud .",
    "we then used flash2.5 to reproduce the standard case of triggered collapse of foster & boss ( 1996 ) , and verified that flash2.5 was able to produce simultaneous triggered collapse and injection of shock wave material when the shocked cloud was forced to remain isothermal at 10 k. the details of these test cases will be presented in a future paper .    in the present models , we used the two dimensional , cylindrical coordinate ( @xmath9 ) version of flash2.5 , with axisymmetry about the rotational axis ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "multipole gravity was used , including legendre polynomials up to @xmath11 .",
    "the equation of state routines were taken to be those for a simple perfect gas with a mean molecular weight of @xmath12 .",
    "as in foster & boss ( 1996 ) , the target dense cloud core is a stable bonnor - ebert ( be ) sphere with a mass of 1 @xmath5 , a radius of 0.058 pc , a temperature of @xmath13 k , and a maximum density of @xmath14 g @xmath15 at rest near the top of the cylindrical grid .",
    "the be sphere is embedded in an intercloud medium with a density of @xmath16 g @xmath15 and a temperature of 10 k. the shock wave begins at the top of the grid and propagates downward at 20 km / sec toward the be sphere .",
    "the shock wave has a thickness of 0.003 pc with a uniform density of @xmath17 g @xmath15 and a temperature of 1000 k. the shock wave is followed by a wind with a density of @xmath16 g @xmath15 and temperature of 1000 k also moving downward at 20 km / sec .",
    "the shock wave material is represented by a color field , initially defined to be equal to 1 inside the shock wave and 0 elsewhere , which allows the shock wave material to be tracked in time ( foster & boss 1997 ) .",
    "the slri are assumed to be contained in dust grains of sub - micron size ( bianchi & schneider 2007 ) , small enough for the grains to remain coupled to the gas .",
    "these initial conditions are identical to those in the standard case of foster & boss ( 1996 ) , with the exception of the temperatures of 1000 k in the shock and wind , and the nonzero velocity of the wind .",
    "the cylindrical grid is 0.197 pc long in @xmath18 and 0.063 pc wide in @xmath19 .",
    "we set the number of blocks in @xmath19 to be 5 and in @xmath18 to be 15 , leading to approximately uniform spacing in @xmath19 and @xmath18 , with each block consisting of @xmath20 grid points , equivalent to an initial grid of @xmath21 .",
    "with up to five levels of refinement allowed , flash is then able to follow small - scale structures with the effective resolution of a grid 16 times finer in scale , or effectively @xmath22 , somewhat higher than the highest resolution of @xmath23 used by vanhala & boss ( 2000 ) , but less than the resolution of @xmath24 used by vanhala & boss ( 2002 ) .",
    "in the absence of cooling , flash produces an adiabatic evolution with an effective @xmath25 .",
    "model nc was run without cooling , but with the temperature constrained to be less than 1000 k. the shock wave was unable to compress any part of the target cloud to a density higher than about twice that of the initial central density of the cloud .",
    "much of the cloud was heated to temperatures of 100 k to 1000 k , preventing cloud collapse . instead",
    ", the cloud s remnants were swept up by the shock wave and wind and transported off the grid .",
    "this result is quite similar to that obtained by foster & boss ( 1996 ) for the standard case when run with an adiabatic pressure law ( @xmath25 ) rather than an isothermal pressure law .",
    "we next ran three models with variations in the cooling function , based on the results of neufeld & kaufman ( 1993 ) , who calculated the radiative cooling caused by rotational and vibrational transitions of optically thin , warm molecular gas composed of h@xmath6o , co , and h@xmath6 , finding h@xmath6o to be the dominant cooling agent .",
    "their figure 3 shows that over the range of temperature from 100 k to 4000 k , the total cooling rate coefficient @xmath26 can be approximated as @xmath27 erg @xmath28 s@xmath29 . the cooling rate @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the number density of molecular hydrogen and @xmath32 is the number density of the molecular species under consideration . assuming that @xmath33 , we take @xmath34 , leading to @xmath35 erg @xmath15 s@xmath29 , where @xmath36 is the gas density in g @xmath15 .",
    "the figures show the results of model c , which used the neufeld & kaufman ( 1993 ) cooling rate as well as the constraint that the temperatures remain at 1000 k or less .",
    "figure 1 shows that rayleigh - taylor ( r - t ) fingers form immediately after the shock strikes the cloud and penetrate downward farthest along the symmetry axis .",
    "kelvin - helmholtz ( k - h ) rolls form soon thereafter , as the shock front ablates material off the sides of the cloud and transports it downstream . the color field is injected into the target cloud by a combination of the r - t and k - h instabilities , though the cloud material polluted by the k - h vortices tends to be lost by subsequent ablation ; the r - t fingers have the best chance to inject shock wave material close to the cloud s symmetry axis and hence into the region where a protostar will soon form .",
    "the fact that both gas and dust from the shock wave region are directly injected into the cloud by r - t fingers ensures that slri carried by the shock wave will also be injected , as found in the previous isothermal models ( foster & boss 1997 ; vanhala & boss 2000 , 2002 )    figure 2 shows that after 0.1 myr , a region along the symmetry axis has formed with a maximum density @xmath8 1000 times that of the center of the initial target cloud .",
    "the temperature contours show that the thermal energy generated by compressional heating at the shock - cloud interface is rapidly lost by the molecular cooling .",
    "the maximum temperatures of 1000 k are limited to thin shells at the shock - cloud interface ; cooling is so rapid in the denser regions just inside this interface that the temperature falls to 10 k , the minimum temperature allowed by the calculation .",
    "this rapid cooling makes the evolution similar to that of isothermal models .",
    "figures 3 and 4 show a close - up of the forming protostar along the symmetry axis , after 0.16 myr , when the maximum density has reached @xmath37 g @xmath15 .",
    "lower density regions continue to infall onto the growing central protostar with velocities on the order of 1 km / sec , highly supersonic compared to the sound speed for 10 k gas of 0.2 km / sec .",
    "clearly the protostar has entered the dynamic collapse phase , and will form a central protostellar core surrounded by an infalling envelope .",
    "figure 4 shows that while the protostar is polluted with shock wave material , the lower density gas that will soon accrete onto the protostar typically has an even higher density of shock wave material than that already in the protostar .",
    "note that the present models do not include rotation of the target cloud , so a protoplanetary disk can not form in these models .",
    "we estimate the injection efficiency of the shock wave material into the forming protostar by calculating the amount of color residing inside regions with density greater than @xmath38 g @xmath15 at the time ( 0.16 myr ) shown in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "the fraction of the incident color field that was injected into this infalling region is @xmath8 0.003 for model c. this low injection efficiency is similar to that ( @xmath8 0.002 ) obtained by vanhala & boss ( 2002 ) in their extremely high resolution , isothermal shock - cloud models , for a comparable definition of injection efficiency .",
    "such a low injection efficiency is in accord with a supernova as the source of the shock wave .",
    "based on the estimates of cameron et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , foster & boss ( 1997 ) noted that the @xmath0al - containing gas and dust in a supernova shock wave would have to be diluted by a factor of @xmath39 in order to explain the inferred initial abundance of @xmath0al in the solar nebula , i.e. , @xmath40 of shock - wave material should be injected into a 1 @xmath5 presolar cloud . in the standard case ,",
    "the mass of the shock wave that is incident on the target cloud is 0.016 @xmath5 , so the desired injection efficiency is @xmath41 . however",
    ", given that not all of the 1 @xmath5 target cloud will be accreted by the protostar , the injection efficiency would need to be half as large if only 0.5 @xmath5 is accreted , dropping the desired injection efficiency to @xmath42 , the same as that obtained in model c. many other factors enter into the desired injection efficiency , such as radioactive decay , nucleosynthetic yields ( rauscher et al .",
    "2002 ) , and sweeping - up of intervening interstellar cloud material , so these estimates should only be taken as being consistent to order of magnitude .",
    "two other models with cooling were calculated , identical to model c except for having the neufeld & kaufman ( 1993 ) cooling rate doubled ( model 2c ) or halved ( model 0.5c ) , in order to test the sensitivity of the results to the assumed cooling rate .",
    "both models evolved very similarly to model c , with the main difference being that the amount of injected shock front material was about 1/3 higher in model 2c and about 1/10 lower in model 0.5c . evidently simultaneous triggering and injection is relatively insensitive to changes in @xmath43 of this magnitude .",
    "finally , it is worth considering why these results differ from those of vc , who were unable to achieve simultaneous triggering and injection in their three dimensional sph models with cooling .",
    "the reasons appear to be three - fold .",
    "first , the flash amr code with ppm is superb at representing the physics of shock waves striking target clouds , such as the r - t and k - h instabilities that dominate these interactions .",
    "sph has its strengths , but sph is relatively poor at resolving the r - t and k - h dynamical instabilities ( e.g. , agertz et al .",
    "second , the neufeld & kaufman ( 1993 ) cooling rate estimate is a considerable improvement over the cooling rates used in vc , which included many species , but did not include the contribution due to h@xmath6o , which neufeld & kaufman ( 1993 ) found to be dominant .",
    "third , and perhaps most importantly , low injection efficiencies would be hard to detect in the vc sph calculations , which typically involved only 5000 particles in the target cloud , so that the desired dilution factor of @xmath44 for a supernova shock wave ( foster & boss 1997 ) would require that only half a particle be injected .",
    "these models show that when cooling by molecular species is included , a 20 km / sec shock wave is able to trigger the gravitational collapse of an otherwise stable , solar - mass dense cloud core , as well as to inject appropriate amounts of supernova shock wave material into the collapsing cloud core .",
    "this injected material consists of shock wave gas as well as dust grains small enough to remain coupled to the gas , i.e. , sub - micron - sized grains , which are expected to characterize supernova shock waves ( bianchi & schneider 2007 ) and to carry the slri whose decay products have been found in refractory inclusions of chondritic meteorites ( lee et al .",
    "evidently a radiative - phase supernova shock wave is able to cool sufficiently rapidly to behave in much the same way as a shock wave that is assumed to remain isothermal with the target cloud ( boss 1995 ; foster & boss 1996 , 1997 ; vanhala & boss 2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "these models thus lend strong support to the hypothesis first advanced by cameron & truran ( 1977 ) that a supernova shock wave carrying slri may have triggered the formation of the solar system .",
    "we thank tomasz plewa for valuable assistance with using flash2.5 and roger chevalier , james stone , and the two referees for their comments .",
    "this research was supported in part by nasa origins of solar systems grant nng05gi10 g and nasa planetary geology and geophysics grant nnx07ap46 g , and is contributed in part to nasa astrobiology institute grant ncc2 - 1056 .",
