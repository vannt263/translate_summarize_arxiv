    "there has recently been renewed interest in the similarities between the equations of fluid dynamics and those of quantum mechanics @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this is a venerable subject @xcite .  in a previous article @xcite",
    "we have shown how any solution of the multi - variable , multi - dimensional generalization of the simplest flow equation , the euler - monge equation , is related to a particular type of solution to a linear diffusion or heat equation , in twice the number of `` spatial '' dimensions .",
    "but , as is well - known , the heat equation when complexified is just the schrdinger equation .",
    "so the method of @xcite may be viewed as a new transformation relating the euler - monge and dimensionally - doubled schrdinger equations , which differs from the transformation of madelung .    here",
    ", we extend this result , especially in the case of one space dimension , to a flow equation driven by some particular , given pressure terms ( i.e. so - called `` body forces '' ) .",
    "when the given pressure - gradient is either @xmath0 or @xmath1 independent , we obtain the general solution for such pressure driven flows in closed but implicit form , and we relate these solutions to those of driven diffusion / schrdinger equations .",
    "the corresponding schrdinger equation contains a potential whose form is related to the pressure - gradient .",
    "we also find explicit series solutions in a variety of situations .",
    "special attention is given to constant and linear pressure - gradients .",
    "we discuss the complexification required to obtain the schrdinger equation , and we emphasize analogies between the heat equation and the wigner - moyal equation for the evolution of quantum mechanical densities .",
    "in addition , we show how solutions of a related bateman equation may be constructed",
    ".    should there be any lack of motivation to consider such matters , perhaps a brief historical overview is warranted .",
    "the euler - monge ( e - m ) equations embodied in fluid dynamics first appeared in 18th and 19th century studies of both fluid flow @xcite and analytic geometry @xcite .",
    "riemann took up a study of the equations in the context of gas dynamics , discussing the equations as a theory of invariants @xcite  ( for a modern textbook treatment , see @xcite ) .",
    "his approach is widely applicable to almost _ all _ nonlinear flow problems , although it does not triumph over turbulence .  a systematic modern discussion of the e - m equations that synthesizes ideas from both geometry and invariance theory can be found in the review by dubrovin and novikov @xcite .",
    "most contemporary texts and reviews stress the _ universal _ role played by these nonlinear transport equations in accordance with whitham s theory @xcite :  essentially all nonlinear waves , even those in dispersive and dissipative media , involve e - m equations , or simple variants of them , if the nonlinear wavetrains are slowly varying .",
    "this makes the equations particularly useful for analyzing the asymptotic behavior of nonlinear solutions .  the e - m equations and their conservation laws also serve as a useful starting point in polyakov s study of turbulence @xcite but without yet leading to a general solution of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "in short , the euler - monge equations appear widespread across a very broad landscape of physics and applied mathematics problems , and therefore it is important to understand their solutions at as many levels as possible .  to that end",
    "we shall map some solutions of the e - m equations with given pressure - gradients onto linear diffusion / schrdinger equations .",
    "suppose we ask for the condition that @xmath2 is a solution of the following linear diffusion equation in two ( @xmath1 and @xmath3 ) dimensions @xcite with a given `` potential '' term @xmath4 : @xmath5 this holds if and only if a nonlinear equation is satisfied by @xmath6:@xmath7 we will call this the `` pressure driven euler - monge equation . ''",
    "the function @xmath8 is the pressure - gradient , @xmath9 , as it would appear in the navier - stokes equation for an incompressible fluid without viscosity .",
    "here , we shall concentrate on pressure - gradients which are _ given _ functions , especially those which are time - independent , @xmath10 , and not have @xmath11 determined by an equation of state .",
    "( hence , our discussion is not truly a description of ideal non - viscous fluid flow . )    the linear equation ( [ diffusion ] ) can always be attacked , at least formally , by the propagator method .",
    "however , in general , it is not possible to find explicit , closed - form solutions , either to that linear equation or to the associated nonlinear equation ( [ pressure ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , general implicit solutions to the nonlinear equation can be obtained in closed form , as shown below , when the pressure - gradient is either a function of @xmath1 alone , or of @xmath0 alone .  moreover , in cases where the pressure takes simple forms , special explicit solutions exist , in terms of which the general solution may be constructed .",
    "in this section we discuss some simple cases before treating a general pressure term .",
    "the technique we use is a variant of the well - known method of characteristics .",
    "first , consider the case of the constant pressure equation , with @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 two elementary special solutions are given by @xmath14 now , to obtain the general solution , just set one of these expressions to be an arbitrary differentiable function of the other .",
    "@xmath15 for any differentiable @xmath16 , where in ( [ implicit ] ) , @xmath17 .",
    "this result is well - known @xcite .  by taking @xmath1 and @xmath0 partial derivatives",
    ", the reader will easily verify that as a consequence of ( [ implicit ] ) , @xmath18 must satisfy the euler - monge equation ( [ eulermonge ] ) .    next , consider the equation resulting from a linear pressure , @xmath19 , hence constant pressure - gradient , @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 two special solutions are given by @xmath22 then the general solution is given by @xmath23 where again @xmath16 is any differentiable function , and where @xmath24 in this last equation .",
    "in the case of a quadratic pressure the equation becomes @xmath25 with a linear forcing term @xmath26 .",
    "a particular solution is now given by @xmath27 ( dividing by @xmath28 and taking the limit @xmath29 recovers the first of ( [ constantpsolns ] ) . )",
    "now we can construct another solution by translating @xmath30 by @xmath31 to give @xmath32 ( in the @xmath29 limit this gives the trivial solution in ( [ constantpsolns ] ) . )  the general solution is now given implicitly by @xmath33 with @xmath16 an arbitrary differentiable function .",
    "one way of proceeding with equation ( [ pressure ] ) , in the case of arbitrary time - independent @xmath34 is not to consider @xmath35 as a function of @xmath1 and@xmath36 , but to think of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath1 and@xmath37 , i.e. the hodograph method @xcite",
    ".  then we have @xmath38 this transforms equation ( [ pressure ] ) into a _ linear _",
    "equation for @xmath0 . @xmath39 the solution for general @xmath40 is easily constructed from this .",
    "we turn this equation into an integro - differential equation by integration with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath41 where @xmath42 is an arbitrary function of integration .",
    "this equation is then formally solved by iteration : @xmath43 since every term in the expansion is a product of a function of @xmath1 with a function of @xmath35 , all these terms are easily disentangled .",
    "the terms linear in @xmath44 can be evaluated separately to give@xmath45 the @xmath46th term in the remaining series of terms is given by @xmath47 times @xmath48 where the pressure is @xmath49 .",
    "these terms can be summed .",
    "after an integration by parts , the final result is @xmath50 this is the general solution to ( [ impliciteqn ] ) with boundary value @xmath51 .    the result ( [ implicitsolution ] ) is easily checked to be a solution to ( [ impliciteqn ] ) .",
    "we recognize this as again being of the form where an arbitrary function of one particular solution of ( [ pressure ] ) is set equal to a second particular solution .  in this case",
    "@xmath52 involves an arbitrary function of the combination that gives a particular time - independent solution , @xmath53 , of the time - independent special case of ( [ pressure ] ) , @xmath54 , and the remaining terms in @xmath55 implicitly furnish another particular solution of the fully time - dependent ( [ pressure ] ) .",
    "similar statements apply to the situation where the driving term is a function of only @xmath0 , and not @xmath1 .",
    "thus @xmath56 is solved implicitly by @xmath57 ,  where the latter function has as its argument the same form as the particular @xmath1-independent solution @xmath58 .",
    "[ [ building - up - to - the - extra - dimension ] ] building up to the extra dimension + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    of course , the existence of an implicit solution , while providing a pleasing theoretical establishment of integrability , is not much use in many practical applications .",
    "so we also look for power series expansions in @xmath0 .",
    "consider first the case of a constant pressure - gradient,@xmath59 further time differentiation removes the explicit @xmath28 , just as it would for any time - independent @xmath60 , @xmath61 if the power series is denoted by @xmath62 we have @xmath63 , @xmath64 ,  and so on .  that is,@xmath65 the resulting expression for @xmath66 for @xmath67 is therefore given , for constant @xmath68 by @xmath69 here , the floor function , @xmath70 , is the greatest integer less than or equal to @xmath71  hence,@xmath72 this last expression involving the exponential , evaluated at @xmath73 after all differentiations , evokes the extra - dimensional approach .     to follow through on that idea ,",
    "recall that hermite polynomials are given by ( @xcite , * 22.3.10 * ) @xmath74 so , taking @xmath75 of both sides of ( [ nthtimederiv ] ) , we find , formally , @xmath76 this result allows us to perform the sum , to obtain @xmath77 through use of the generating function ( @xcite , * 22.9.17 * ) @xmath78  thus we conclude@xmath79 the rhs clearly involves just the time evolution of @xmath80 , evaluated at the extra dimension boundary , @xmath73 , but under the action of a slightly modified extension of the time - dependent kernel in @xcite , such that the initial data has a supplementary shift @xmath81 .     comparing this to the undriven situation",
    ", we see the physical interpretation is simply that of a constant external acceleration imposed uniformly on the nonlinear self - interaction of the fluid .",
    "if we `` fall '' along with the self - interacting fluid , constantly accelerating with it , the effects of the external acceleration are removed .",
    "that is to say , from galilean covariance , if @xmath18 is any solution of ( [ eulermonge ] ) , then @xmath82 is a solution of ( [ emconstantgrad ] ) .",
    "[ [ working - down - from - the - extra - dimension ] ] working down from the extra dimension + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the previous implicit solutions suggest another way to obtain results in terms of an extra - dimensional equation :  incorporate one of the particular solutions into the exponential along with @xmath18 .",
    "for example , define @xmath83 then we have@xmath84 this gives an equivalence between the euler - monge equation with linear pressure - gradients , ( [ emlineargrad ] ) , and solutions , of the form given in ( [ lineargradientu ] ) , to the following modified extra - dimensional linear equation . @xmath85",
    "the formal solution to this linear equation is given by the propagator method .",
    "@xmath86 where the operator kernel obeys @xmath87 that is , the kernel is a time - ordered exponential @xcite given by the usual series of nested integrals .",
    "@xmath88 this time - ordered exponential can be worked out as products of ordinary exponentials , through use of the underlying algebra.@xmath89   = 0=\\left [   b , c\\right ]   \\;,\\;\\;\\;\\left [   a , b\\right ]   = a\\ ; , \\label{algebra}%\\ ] ] where @xmath90 .",
    "note that @xmath91 is central .",
    "writing@xmath92 we see that we need to solve an evolution equation of the form@xmath93 with @xmath94 , where @xmath95 obey ( [ algebra ] ) , and where the coefficients @xmath96 commute with everything .",
    "the solution is given by the baker - campbell - hausdorff technique .",
    "@xmath97 for the case at hand , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and    @xmath101 .",
    "so@xmath102 the right - most exponential operator rescales @xmath1 and @xmath3 in the initial data , and the left - most operator then evolves these data as in the undriven case , except for the replacement @xmath103 .",
    "thus the action of this kernel on the initial , exponentiated data becomes@xmath104 as in @xcite , series expansion in powers of @xmath3 and evaluation of ( [ frakusolution ] ) at @xmath73 produces a time series solution for @xmath105 , since @xmath106 .",
    "the series so obtained explicitly exhibits any difference between @xmath35 and the particular solution incorporated into the exponential.@xmath107 once having found these results so systematically  although perhaps somewhat laboriously  their interpretation is almost as simple as for the case of a constant driving term .  as the reader may check by direct substitution ,",
    "if @xmath18 is any solution of ( [ eulermonge ] ) , then @xmath108 is a solution of ( [ emlineargrad ] ) resulting from the same initial value data @xcite .    the preceding modification of the propagator approach to ( [ diffusion ] ) can be employed for general pressure - gradients .",
    "if @xmath109 is a particular solution to ( [ pressure ] ) , even if the pressure - gradient depends on both @xmath1 _ and _ @xmath0 , then @xmath110 satisfies the linear equation@xmath111 if and only if @xmath112 .",
    "thus , evolution of any exponentiated initial data , expressed as @xmath113 , can be effected by solving a linear equation for the kernel appropriate to ( [ generallinearequation ] ) , and acting with that kernel on @xmath114  for certain problems , in addition to the @xmath115 case just discussed , this approach may be simpler to carry through than a direct attempt to construct the propagator for ( [ diffusion ] ) .",

    "it is perhaps not so well - known that the series solution ( [ seriessolution ] ) leads to the same conclusions .  in general",
    ", this may require some asymptotic approximations , but it is easy to find simple analytical examples .",
    "a particularly elementary illustration of a breaking kinematic wave is given by taking continuous , piecewise linear @xmath35 profiles .",
    "first consider the case of the undriven euler - monge equation .",
    "the time power series sum ( [ seriessolution ] ) for @xmath116 is easily evaluated in this case .",
    "take one particular initial linear segment to be@xmath117 then we have @xmath118 , and so , for the time development of this segment,@xmath119 the segment becomes vertical at its `` break - time '' @xmath120 , and while obvious , it is perhaps worth stressing that this is precisely the same as the radius of convergence of the time power series ( [ seriessolution ] ) .    continuously rising and falling combinations of such linear segments , forming a triangular `` bump , '' with equal amounts of rise and fall ,",
    "have conserved height and base length .",
    "hence the triangle s area is constant .",
    "so too for the area under a continuous polygonal bump .",
    "this area conservation is just what you would expect from the euler - monge equation , written as a local conservation law : @xmath121 .",
    "at least , this is what you would expect for continuous and _ differentiable _ functions .",
    "the fact that the same integrated conservation law also applies to continuous , piecewise differentiable functions may be surprising upon first encounter , but it is well - known to be true @xcite .",
    "after the earliest such break - time , the continuous piecewise linear @xmath35 profile will no longer be single - valued .",
    "if there are physical reasons to prohibit this , a standard procedure is to replace the continuous but multi - valued @xmath35 with a shock discontinuity , positioned so as to preserve the previously mentioned area conservation ( cf .",
    "the rankine - hugoniot rule , or the lax entropy condition @xcite ) .",
    "when constant pressure - gradients drive the euler - monge equation , the result ( [ seriessolution ] ) shows the same initial linear segment evolves as@xmath122 with the same break - time as before , @xmath120 .  when linear pressure - gradients are added to the euler - monge equation , ( [ linearseriessolution ] ) shows the initial linear segment evolves as@xmath123 with modified break - time given by @xmath124 .",
    "again , these break - times are just the radii of convergence for the respective time power series .",
    "another example is given by taking exponential initial data , for which we take the @xmath116 case to again see the wave evolution from the series ( [ seriessolution ] ) .",
    "suppose that initially @xmath125 , then @xmath126 , so@xmath127 this series is familiar to anyone who has ever attempted to find by iteration the inverse function for the elementary equation @xmath128 , i.e. to obtain @xmath129 .",
    "lambert and euler studied the analytic properties of a generalization .",
    "there is a contemporary movement to standardize the function and name it after lambert @xcite .  the resulting `` lambert w function '' series definition , its log derivative , and its key functional relation",
    "are given by@xmath130 this series converges absolutely for @xmath131 .",
    "so the above solution ( [ lambertseries ] ) for exponential initial data is @xmath132 the radius of convergence of the series for @xmath35 is therefore both @xmath0- and @xmath133-dependent .",
    "absolute convergence holds when @xmath134 .",
    "actually , the lambert function is well - behaved for all positive arguments , as is obvious from the inverse function , hence the exponential shape evolves backward in time without the formation of any singularities .  but",
    "for forward time evolution , the wave always breaks , or forms a shock - front , and it does so at earlier times for larger @xmath1 .",
    "the condition for the wave to break , for positive @xmath0 , is just that the radius of convergence of the time power series is reached .",
    "that is @xmath135 .  at this time , for the given position , the slope of the wave profile becomes vertical , since@xmath136 and @xmath137 gives @xmath138 .",
    "the motion of the vertical face of the wave is simply given by @xmath139 or@xmath140 there is also the implicit definition of @xmath18 provided by ( [ implicit ] ) when specialized to the case at hand : @xmath141 , or @xmath142 this functional relation is immediately seen to be the familiar one obeyed by the lambert function , as in ( [ lambertprops ] ) above .  indeed , our derivation of the series solution to the euler - monge equation for general data obeying ( [ implicit ] ) may be thought of as a generalization of such series solutions to an infinite class of such functional relations .",
    "we plot below the @xmath143 @xmath116 case of @xmath35 for various @xmath0 .",
    "the exponential initial data @xmath144 is shown as a black curve .  with our sign conventions in the euler - monge equations ,",
    "the wave moves to the left .  for negative @xmath0",
    "the solution is also unbounded as @xmath145 , but non - singular for finite @xmath1 , as shown by green curves in the right - most part of the figure for various negative times .  for positive @xmath0",
    ", vertical profiles occur where the curve has infinite slope , at the points indicated by small circles on the tips of the series - defined segments of @xmath105 shown by green curves in the left - most part of the figure for various positive times .",
    "the series fails to converge for larger values of @xmath1 , beyond these tips .",
    "( in more realistic situations , this may be indicative of some missing physics , such as would be represented by adding higher @xmath1 derivatives in the original pde , as in burgers equation , see @xcite . )",
    "however , the implicit definition of @xmath146 given by the functional relation ( [ implicit ] ) serves to define upper branches of @xmath18 that are shown by the orange curves extending beyond the location of the vertical face .",
    "these upper branches may be thought of as the overhanging portions of the breaking wave .",
    "a pretty numerical example of a continuous , integrable , piecewise exponential wave is obtained by joining rising and falling exponentials , so that the initial data is @xmath147 .",
    "the time evolution of this example can be found graphically displayed on the website of one of the authors .",

    "( recall the model is non - relativistic . )",
    "moreover , we may extend the solution ( [ lambertfront ] ) of the euler - monge equation stemming from the exponential initial data , using the analysis of the preceding subsections , to find the constant body - force solution arising from the same initial data.@xmath153 we also find the corresponding linear body - force solution.@xmath154 thus we have conditions for the wave profile to be vertical ( signaling the local formation of shocks ) whenever the arguments of the lambert functions are equal to @xmath155 , i.e. @xmath156 respectively , for the three situations considered .",
    "the latter two conditions are very implicit determinations of @xmath157 .",
    "in this section a trivial method is given to construct an infinite number of solutions to the diffusion equation starting from a solution of the monge equation , which might well be taken as one of the particular solutions of explicit form .",
    "this follows very simply from the existence of operators which commute with the diffusion operator .",
    "consider the case where @xmath158 , i.e the free case . then",
    "because @xmath159 and the `` boost '' generator @xmath160 all commute with the operator @xmath161 , we can find an infinite class of solutions of the diffusion equation based upon the solution @xmath35 of the monge equation by operating upon the `` primitive '' solution @xmath162 with arbitrary functions of these operators .",
    "( in fact only three such operators are required , as the diffusion operator is itself a combination of the others . ) for example , consider @xmath163 where @xmath16 is an arbitrary function with no singularity at the origin , or @xmath164 note that in fact this latter class is really the same as the former , on account of the differential equation satisfied by @xmath35 : all time derivatives may be replaced by derivatives with respect to @xmath1 .  in the case of generic @xmath165 , the only operator which commutes with the diffusion operator ( [ diffusion ] ) is @xmath166 .",
    "but there are exceptional cases .",
    "for example , when @xmath167 , the boost generator @xmath168 also commutes .",

    "suppose further that another solution of the diffusion equation is sought of the form @xmath171 .",
    "then it may be verified that @xmath172 satisfies the equation @xmath173 if @xmath35 is known explicitly then this equation can be integrated :  in the case @xmath169 , @xmath174 , and in the case @xmath175 @xmath176 .",
    "the diffusion equation may be interpreted as a schrdinger equation , upon complexification .  to be explicit ,",
    "consider the time - dependent schrdinger equation for a harmonic potential in one dimension .",

    "on the other hand , the symmetric generators@xmath206 also commute with @xmath207 , and may be used to construct other conserved densities .",
    "it is amusing that the conservation laws ( [ conservation ] ) are _ exactly _ of the form as in the introductory remarks of @xcite , with complexification of the second - derivatives coefficient .",
    "unfortunately , if that coefficient is not purely imaginary , then the construction falters for real point - splittings .  in other words , for real functions obeying the real diffusion equation this particular collection of conservation laws does not exist .",
    "still , it is also amusing that one could indeed think of the point - splitting as introducing extra dimensions , and doing so by dimension - doubling .",
    "the wave functions involved in the currents are then just two distinct types of particular free wave functions in twice the number of spatial dimensions , namely @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "they each obey the extra - dimensional equations @xmath210 there are other solutions of these free particle equations , of course , but as in @xcite we need only make use of particular solutions to encode the conservation laws .",
    "in previous investigations @xcite , the euler - monge equation was used to obtain the prototypical bateman equation @xcite .",
    "this section addresses the question of what happens when the pressure term is added , and gives solutions of the resulting modified bateman equation .",
    "first of all we notice that the equation @xmath211 holds whatever the pressure term is , provided it is dependent only upon @xmath1 .",
    "this implies the existence of a scalar @xmath212 such that @xmath213 that is,@xmath214 this and ( [ pressure ] ) imply that @xmath215 satisfies a bateman - like equation , in interaction with an external field : @xmath216 note that the rhs preserves homogeneity in @xmath215 , but breaks homogeneity in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , in general .  in the particular case where @xmath217 , a constant , and @xmath218 , @xmath215 is determined by ( [ phieqns ] ) to be @xmath219 .",
    "since any function of @xmath215 will also satisfy the bateman - like equation ( as is clear from ( [ uasphis ] ) ) , we might as well take the square root of this for verification of ( [ bateman - like ] ) .",
    "if @xmath220 are arbitrary differentiable functions of @xmath215 , then the general solution of the bateman - like equation when the pressure - gradient is constant is given by solving implicitly for @xmath215 the following equation : @xmath221 direct calculation establishes this result .",
    "we find@xmath222 and hence@xmath223 substitution of these last two expressions into the bateman - like equation ( [ bateman - like ] ) proves the claim .  the implicit equation ( [ implicitbateman ] ) gives the general solution to ( [ bateman - like ] ) ,  for constant pressure - gradient , as it depends upon two independent arbitrary functions .",
    "a similar result can be found in the case of a linear pressure - gradient term , @xmath167 , which is the unique example that preserves homogeneity in @xmath1 for ( [ bateman - like ] ) .  here , the general solution is given by the implicit solution for @xmath215 of the following equation : @xmath224 once again , direct calculation establishes this result .",
    "this is the second known case where a generalized form of the bateman equation is integrable , the other being the so - called `` two dimensional born - infeld equation '' @xcite .",
    "more general pressure - gradients appear to be less tractable for the bateman - like equation , even implicitly , without resorting to the euler - monge form of the equation .",
    "note that the recipe which worked to obtain implicit solutions of the driven euler - monge equation for arbitrary @xmath225 is not as useful for ( [ bateman - like ] ) , since thinking of @xmath226 instead of @xmath227 does not linearize that equation .",
    "we have considered here the effects of given pressure - gradients on the one - dimensional flows of the euler - monge equation , and on the corresponding driven diffusion / schrdinger equations expressed in an extra dimension .",
    "the extra dimension method provides some additional insight and computational tools beyond those given by the method of characteristics and the technique of constructing implicit solutions , which we have discussed and compared .",
    "while we have touched on some elementary features of conservation laws for the free particle schrdinger case , including their relation to the wigner - moyal equation , a full analysis of higher - dimensional driven flows along the lines of @xcite  remains to be given @xcite .",
