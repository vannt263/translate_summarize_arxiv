    "observations using the  advanced ccd imaging camera ( acis ) and the  ( _ hst _ ) further supported this interpretation @xcite .",

    "the signals from corresponding polarization channels were summed in hardware , and the total - power samples from each of 96 frequency channels were sampled every @xmath25s and recorded to disk for off - line analysis .",
    "we analyzed the data using standard pulsar search techniques , implemented in the presto software package @xcite .",
    "first we identified and excised radio - frequency interference .",
    "we then dedispersed the data in the dm range 0110  @xmath26  pc , with resolution of 0.3  @xmath26  pc .",
    "this is twice the maximum galactic dm predicted for this line of sight by the @xcite electron density model ; for the distance range of 250800  pc , within which the neutron star likely lies (  1 ) , the predicted dm range is 29  @xmath26  pc .",
    "each time series contained 1.2 billion points , and would have been needlessly challenging to analyze .",
    "we therefore down - sampled the data to a resolution of 0.288  ms , resulting in much more reasonable time series of 300 million points . for a dm of 40  @xmath26  pc ,",
    "the smearing caused by dispersion across one of the frequency channels is 0.3  ms , so that for smaller dms the effective time resolution of the search was about 0.3  ms .",
    "we performed the periodicity search using fast - fourier techniques , and were sensitive to periods @xmath27  ms .",
    "in order to improve sensitivity for a range of pulse duty cycles , we incoherently summed up to 16 harmonics of the data ; for @xmath28  ms , we maintained good sensitivity for duty cycles down to about @xmath29 .",
    "the sensitivity at long periods decreases gradually due to red noise , but this is not a significant concern for @xmath30  s. unfortunately , we found no convincing pulsar candidates in this search .    using the standard modification to the radiometer equation , assuming a pulse shape with 10% duty cycle , we were sensitive to pulsars with @xmath28ms having a period - averaged flux density at 820mhz @xmath31jy , with gradually decreasing sensitivity for smaller periods .",

    "@xmath80 ( 709 corrected for background ) , so we find @xmath81 corresponding to @xmath82 .",
    "we verified this analytic expression by examining folded light curves at the periods associated with the maximum values of @xmath50 .",
    "it is not surprising that the pulsed fraction of a @xmath3-ray pulsar in x - rays should be less than @xmath83 .",
    "this is not a very sensitive limit consdering that other @xmath3-ray pulsars whose soft x - rays are predominantly thermal ( geminga , psr b105552 , possibly psr b0656 + 14 ) have even smaller pulsed fractions ( 30% , 21% , and 12% , respectively , * ? ? ? * ) . in these cases ,",
    "the pulse profiles are quasi - sinusoidal .",
    "the @xmath50 test is therefore a good one for , whose x - rays are also dominated by a soft thermal source within the response of the  hrc , although the result is not very restrictive in this case .",
    "we also note that the vela pulsar has a more complicated pulse shape , while its pulsed fraction is only 9% @xcite .",
    "in order to test for proper motion of the neutron star , we compared the position of  on the hrc with the acis position obtained 3 years earlier @xcite .",

    "in order to bound the possible proper motion , we adopt an upper limit that is twice this difference , or @xmath92 , corresponding to @xmath93  yr@xmath6 .",
    "this allows the neutron star to have traveled from a birth in the galactic plane to its present position in @xmath94  yr or longer , which is not an unreasonable age for its x - ray temperature . at the maximum distance of 800  pc ,",
    "the limit on @xmath0 corresponds to a tangential velocity limit @xmath7 km  s@xmath6 , which is typical for radio pulsars .",
    "even in the absence of detectable pulsations ,  remains the leading ( and only ) candidate for identification with .",
    "its soft x - ray spectrum , and absence of optical and radio emission , support the hypothesis that it is an older and possibly more distant cousin of the geminga pulsar .",
    "the upper limit on proper motion that we derived is a significant new observational constraint , allowing an age of at least @xmath94  yr for  if it was born in the galactic plane .",
    "this compares favorably with the characteristic age @xmath95  yr of geminga , and is consistent with a surface temperature of only @xmath61  k , compared with @xmath96  k for geminga @xcite .    assuming that the age and distance of  are both larger than those of geminga , it is likely that  is a maximally efficient @xmath3-ray pulsar close to its death line @xcite , following the trend of @xmath3-ray efficiency increasing with decreasing spin - down power @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we can not rule out that  is a millisecond pulsar with similar spin - down power and magnetospheric gap voltage as geminga .",
    "if so , its thermal x - ray emission may be due to surface reheating by a magnetospheric accelerator .",
    "it is not now possible to make a significantly more sensitive search for x - ray pulsations from , as the operational limitations of  no longer allow long , contiguous pointings .",
    "while _ xmm - newton _ is in principle more sensitive , it has not been used to observe , which lies near the earth - avoidance zone of the satellite orbit , with maximum allowed pointing durations of @xmath97  ks .",
    "finally , the upcoming _ gamma - ray large area space telescope _",
    "( ) may be the best hope of detecting pulsations from .",
    "_ glast _ will certainly reduce the positional uncertainty of , which will be an independent test of association with , and additional motivation for a dedicated pulsar search .",
    "for this , a sufficiently long , pointed observation is best , as argued by @xcite .",
    "we estimate the expected  count rate from  using its photon flux of @xmath98 @xmath99  s@xmath6 between 100  mev and 4  gev @xcite . assuming an average on - axis effective area of 5000  cm@xmath23 for the  large area telescope ( lat ) in this energy range , the predicted count rate is 0.003  s@xmath6 . a more detailed calculation ,",
    "convolving the spectrum of  from figure  3 of @xcite with the lat on - axis effective area curve , predicts a similar rate of 0.0027  s@xmath6 in the 1004000  mev range .",
    "this is almost half the count rate from the  hrc , and holds great promise for a pulsar discovery .",
    "it is likely that  will succeed where failed because , unlike thermal x - rays , @xmath3-rays have sharp peaks with pulsed amplitude approaching 100% . in 1 week of elapsed time , including earth blockage ,  can collect as many photons from  as we have obtained using . on - source time in a pointed observation of  can be higher than average because the source is close to the ecliptic pole .",
    "also , galactic background is negligible at these coordinates @xmath9 .",
