    "compressed sensing ( cs ) @xcite has recently emerged as an efficient technique for sampling a signal with fewer coefficients than the number dictated by classical shannon / nyquist theory .",
    "the assumption underlying this approach is that the signal to be sampled is sparse or at least `` compressible '' , i.e. , it must have a concise representation in a convenient basis . in cs ,",
    "sampling is performed by taking a number of linear projections of the signal onto pseudorandom sequences .",
    "therefore , the acquisition presents appealing properties such as low encoding complexity , since the basis in which the signal is sparse does not need to be computed , and universality , since the sensing is blind to the source distribution .",
    "reconstruction of a signal from its projections can be done e.g. using linear programming @xcite , with a complexity that is @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the number of samples to be recovered .",
    "plenty of applications are possible , ranging from image and video to biomedical and spectral imaging , just to mention a few . a single - pixel camera has been demonstrated in @xcite , which uses a single detector to sequentially acquire random linear measurements of a scene .",
    "this kind of design is very interesting for imaging at wavelength outside the visible light , where manufacturing detectors is very expensive .",
    "cs could be used to design cheaper sensors , or sensors providing better resolution for an equal number of detectors .",
    "e.g. , in @xcite an architecture is proposed based on hadamard imaging , coupled with reconstruction techniques borrowed from cs .    the acquisition of multidimensional signals could benefit from cs due to its low - complexity sampling process and the reduction of the number of samples to be taken , processed and transmitted . in this case",
    ", a serious problem arises regarding the computational complexity of the reconstruction process .",
    "the conventional approach of measuring the signal along all dimensions at once leads to very large @xmath2 , making the reconstruction computationally intractable .",
    "the simplest solution is to take separate sets of measurements grouping subsets of dimensions and to perform separate reconstructions .",
    "for example , an hyperspectral image could be acquired in the spatial or spectral dimensions . however , this ",
    "separate \" approach does not yield satisfactory performance in terms of mean - squared error ( mse ) , as it neglects the overall correlation among every dimension . in the example above",
    ", the spatial cs approach completely neglects the spectral correlation , and the spectral approach neglects the spatial one .    the authors of @xcite showed a way to recast a multidimensional cs problem to a one - dimensional one , by the means of kronecker products of sensing and sparsity matrices .",
    "the problem of this approach is that the dimensionality of the cs problem to be solved rapidly grows as the product of the sizes of each dimension .",
    "the authors of @xcite apply cs to blocks of images considering wavelets as sparsity basis .",
    "reconstruction algorithms for multidimensional signals have also been proposed in @xcite for hyperspectral images and multiview video .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a generic framework for cs acquisition and reconstruction of multidimensional signals .",
    "then , we propose architectures for 2d and 3d signals .",
    "the framework is general since the principles behind the architectures we propose can be easily extended to @xmath0-dimensional signals , with arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the proposed architectures can be practically implemented following the algorithms we devise for each architecture .",
    "the architectures we propose can be applied to several scenarios we describe in the following paragraphs .",
    "the first architecture describes a practical implementation for devices that acquire 2d visual information through progressive scanning @xcite .",
    "these devices are equipped with a one - dimensional array of detectors , and a 2d image is obtained via the repeated use of the array over different slices of the 2d object to be imaged .",
    "this is a very important scenario , which encompasses many applications . amongst others ,",
    "it is worth mentioning at least two examples , which we will focus on in the respective sections of this paper .",
    "the first is given by _",
    "flatbed scanners _ , where each line of the image is acquired by a 1d optical sensor moving in the orthogonal direction . the second one is represented by _ airborne and spaceborne imagers _ of the pushbroom type for remote sensing applications . in this case , the 1d sensor is carried on a flying platform such as an airplane or satellite ; the sensor looks down at the earth , and acquires a line - by - line scan of the underlying scene , while each line is oriented in the across - track direction , and the platform flight moves the sensor from one line to the next one .",
    "these applications , as well as several other ones , can clearly benefit from cs .",
    "devices similar in principle to the single pixel camera can be applied to progressive scanning , where a 1d micromirror array can be used to directly sense lines in the cs format . in the case of the remote sensing imaging system",
    ", cs can lead to a simpler and cheaper system , which uses a single detector and produces a reduced number of sampling .",
    "detectors can be costly in the wavelengths outside the visible spectrum , and the reduced number of samples allows to implement simpler onboard processing systems . for the flatbed scanner ,",
    "cs would be extremely useful in order to develop a scanner of small size , as the cs sensor needs not be of the same physical size as the document being scanned .",
    "moreover , in both cases , processing and data handling would be greatly reduced , which is important in order to reduce power consumption in the remote sensing case , and in order to enable application to small - sized low - power devices in the flatbed scanner case .",
    "the second scenario is the acquisition of hyperspectral images .",
    "satellite imaging is a highly effective tool in a variety of scientific and engineering contexts because of the information it provides about the nature of the materials being imaged .",
    "while traditional digital imaging techniques produce images with scalar values associated with each pixel location , in multi- and hyperspectral images these values are replaced with a vector containing the spectral information associated to that spatial location .",
    "the resulting image is therefore threedimensional ( two spatial and one spectral dimensions ) , and spectral resolution is very important for several applications , including classification , anomaly detection , and spectral unmixing . despite the huge potential ,",
    "however , many modern satellite imagers face a limiting trade - off between spatial and spectral resolution .",
    "in fact , the total number of samples that can be acquired is constrained by the size of the detector array .",
    "this limits the usefulness and cost - effectiveness of spectral imaging for many applications .",
    "this scenario intends to investigate the possibility of overcoming this limitation by means of a new imaging architecture based on cs , that is , an architecture in which the acquisition system does not detect single pixels of the scene , but rather a small number of measurements .",
    "reconstruction of the image is going to be performed at the ground station , and all subsequent processing steps ( radiometric and geometric calibration , orthorectification , and applications ) would be performed on the reconstructed image . in this paper",
    "we consider several possible architectures that are based on the constraints imposed by real - world spectral imaging systems . a first architecture",
    "is derived from 2d imaging systems , and is based on the concept of a sensor that acquires the image as a whole , both spatially and spectrally . in this case , the single - pixel camera paradigm is still applicable , provided that this single pixel is actually a single - pixel spectral imaging device , i.e. one that separates the spectral components of the incoming light into several different wavelengths , in such a way that the integration of spatially modulated light can be done individually in each spectral channel , yielding a different set of linear measurements for each wavelength .",
    "the second architecture mimics spectral imagers of the pushbroom type .",
    "these scanners have a 2d sensor , but the two dimensions correspond to the spectral ( wavelength ) dimension and one spatial dimension , i.e. the direction perpendicular to the flight path . at a given flight position , the scanner acquires at once one spatial - spectral slice , i.e. one line of the image with all its spectral components ; as the satellite or airplane moves one , another spatial - spectral slice is acquired , and this process is repeated until the desired image length has been obtained . in this paper",
    "we also consider a cs imaging architecture based on this paradigm .",
    "we assume that the single - pixel concept is applied to spectral slices , i.e. there is a diffractive element before the single pixel , so that the spatial - spectral slice can be modulated before being sensed by the single detector .",
    "it is worth noticing that these architectures would yield significant benefits to hyperspectral imaging systems .",
    "they would allow to reduce the cost and size of the sensor itself , for the same spatial and spectral resolution , thanks to the reduced number of detectors .",
    "moreover , they would allow to greatly simplify onboard data handling , since the compressed acquisition process would generate much less data than a conventional system , allowing to employ less memory and computing power , eliminating the need of onboard compression altogether , and eventually leading to reduced power consumption , which is a critical aspect of any remote sensing mission . despite the very appealing advantages ,",
    "however , these acquisition architectures entail a reconstruction problem of huge size .",
    "indeed , optimal reconstruction must exploit signal sparsity ( and hence correlation ) in all dimensions , requiring to solve the reconstruction problem at once employing a three - dimensional transform as sparsity model .",
    "this problem has huge computational complexity , and becomes infeasible for rather small image sizes , highlighting the need of techniques that can achieve near - optimal performance with a reasonable computational complexity .    in this paper",
    "we address these scenarios , and tackle the reconstruction problem for 2d and 3d signals . in particular , for 2d images , we propose a simple progressive acquisition algorithm , where rows are acquired independently of each other , but the reconstruction is performed jointly over all rows .",
    "joint reconstruction is achieved through an iterative algorithm that correlates different rows through linear prediction filters , instead of taking a multidimensional transform as sparsity domain .",
    "prediction filters allow to exploit correlation in both horizontal and vertical dimensions , even if the acquisition is performed in one direction only .",
    "the main concept is to exploit correlation along the vertical direction by iteratively predicting each line and reconstructing the prediction error only , which is more compressible than the line itself .",
    "results show that few iterations of the proposed algorithm suffice to significantly improve the mse of the reconstruction , allowing to obtain high - quality reconstruction results with feasible complexity .",
    "on the other hand , for 3d images we have more degrees of freedom than in the 2d case .",
    "for example , in @xcite it has been shown that 2d spatial cs ( i.e. , every spectral channel is measured independently ) has better performance than spectral cs ( in which every spectral vector is measured independently ) , just because the former approach models correlation in two dimensions , and the latter in only one .",
    "however , it should be noted that even spatial cs achieves an mse that is not small enough for many hyperspectral applications , as the relative error is around @xmath3 for sensible values of the number of acquired samples .",
    "the key idea is that , in order to improve reconstruction quality , correlation must be exploited in all three dimensions of the spectral cube . to achieve this goal",
    ", we propose several approaches , combining an accurate modelling of the spatial - spectral correlations , with the low complexity of sequential , as opposed to fully joint , reconstruction .",
    "in particular , instead of modelling the correlation by means of a three - dimensional transform , and hence attempting to reconstruct the hyperspectral cube as a whole , we employ a linear correlation model of the hyperspectral image , and iteratively apply this model band by band , improving the quality of the reconstructed image .",
    "an alternative algorithm applies the model to the spectral rows of the image , iterating along rows .    since the quality of the reconstructed signal depends on two factors : @xmath4 the initialization of the iterative procedure and @xmath5 the accuracy of the linear prediction filters , we consider different initialization strategies based either on a 2d cs approach or on a simplified 3d strategy @xcite and test different prediction filters looking for the one providing better performance .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : background ] contains the background of this work , notations and definitions . in section",
    "[ sec : prop_alg ] we describe in detail the algorithms we propose . in section  [ sec : num_res ] we show some results obtained by simulations and we conclude our work in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",

    "the same algorithm holds for signals which are not exactly sparse , but rather compressible , meaning that they ( or their representation @xmath50 in basis @xmath51 ) can be expressed only by @xmath52 significant coefficients , while the remaining ones are ( close to ) zero .    when the measurements are noisy the @xmath26 minimization with relaxed constraints is used for reconstruction : @xmath53where @xmath54 bounds the amount of noise in the data .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that extracting the elements of @xmath55  at random from a gaussian or rademacher distribution ( i.e. , @xmath56 with the same probability ) , and , in general , from any sub - gaussian distribution , allows a correct reconstruction with overwhelming probability .",
    "in this paper , we propose a general framework for multidimensional signals , allowing to exploit the low complexity and universality of cs in the acquisition process , with a manageable complexity of the reconstruction algorithm .",
    "refer to figure  [ fig : block_diagrams ] , which depicts the canonical approach of considering the multidimensional signal as a single signal ( [ fig : bd_classic ] ) and the architecture proposed in this paper ( [ fig : bd_novel ] ) , based on progressive scanning and iterative reconstruction .",
    "multidimensional signals are often captured in a progressive way , in a sequence of acquisitions corresponding to subsets of the coordinates .",
    "the principle is to acquire separately each signal dimension ( or subsets of dimensions , considering them as single signals ) .",
    "then , instead of reconstructing the whole set of measurements at once , as done with kronecker compressed sensing @xcite , an iterative algorithm is applied to dimensions not involved in the measurement process . at each iteration ,",
    "a linear prediction filter is used to aid the reconstruction process , measuring the prediction and reconstructing the prediction error only , which is supposed to be more compressible than the original signal .",
    "for example , if an hyperspectral image is acquired band by band , the iterative algorithm is applied on wavelength dimension . at each iteration , each band is predicted , acquired with the same sensing matrix used to acquire that band , the measurement of the predicted band is subtracted from the measurement of the band itself and the cs reconstruction is applied to this `` measurement prediction error '' , only .    in the following ,",
    "we specialize the approach to 2d and 3d signals .",
    "we propose novel architectures for 2d and 3d acquisition and reconstruction , and the corresponding algorithms implementing the proposed architectures .",
    "according to typical progressive scanning approaches , like the ones used by commercial flatbed scanners or by remote sensing systems acquiring environmental pictures , an image is acquired by sensing @xmath57 pixels of each row in a progressive fashion , until @xmath58 rows are acquired .",
    "hence , the acquired image will result as a matrix of pixels of size @xmath59 , which will be compressed ( and , accordingly , decoded ) using a conventional technique .",
    "this process requires the acquisition ( and processing ) of @xmath60 pixels .",
    "when @xmath58 and @xmath57 are large , processing of this huge amount of data may represent an issue , especially when dealing with low cost or low complexity devices .",
    "for this reason , we propose a very simple acquisition scheme , based on cs linear measurements taken on each row , without any further processing .",
    "this reduces the amount of data to be acquired and processed .",
    "the reconstruction algorithm relies on linear prediction filters in order to improve the quality of cs reconstruction , by correlating the measurements of adjacent rows in order to exploit their statistical dependencies during the reconstruction stage , largely improving over individual separate reconstruction .",
    "the image acquisition algorithm we propose , labelled as algorithm  [ alg:2d_coding ] , is very simple and consists in taking linear measurements of each row of the image in a progressive fashion . to minimize the risks of failures in the reconstruction side , a different sensing matrix @xmath55",
    "is drawn for each row .",
    "the image to be measured can be divided into @xmath58 rows . for each row ,",
    "@xmath48 linear measurements are taken , where @xmath61 and @xmath57 is the desired vertical resolution .    in summary ,",
    "the scene we wish to acquire is represented by the matrix @xmath62 . for each row of @xmath63",
    ", we draw a matrix @xmath64 whose elements are gaussian i.i.d .",
    "such that @xmath65 , with @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    ". then , we take @xmath48 linear measurements of @xmath68 which will form the rows of the matrix of measurements @xmath69 , namely @xmath70    the image @xmath63 , @xmath48 the measurement matrix @xmath71 draw @xmath72 of size @xmath73 s.t .",
    "@xmath65 @xmath74 @xmath71    a more complex algorithm , based on compressed sensing and able to capture spatial correlation in both directions ( horizontal and vertical ) , could acquire in a single shot the whole image in a single measurement vector of length @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79    even if this algorithm performed better than the one proposed here since the reconstruction would optimally exploit the correlation in 2 dimensions through a 2d transform matrix , it would require the solution of for a vector of length @xmath80 . for realistic values of @xmath58 and @xmath57",
    ", the solution of would be impossible to perform in reasonable time .",
    "on the other hand , the proposed approach splits the problem into smaller ( and hence tractable ) subproblems .",
    "however , in doing so , it does not neglect the spatial correlation in vertical direction , which is modelled and employed in the reconstruction process through the use of linear prediction filters .      a trivial reconstruction algorithm based on the acquisition scheme described in section [ sec : coding ]",
    "would simply apply the @xmath26 reconstruction to recover separately each line of @xmath63  given the corresponding @xmath72 and @xmath81 .",
    "instead , we propose an algorithm which iteratively improves the current estimate of @xmath63  by modelling statistical dependencies between adjacent lines .",
    "we label this algorithm  [ alg:2d_decoding ] .",
    "we count the iterations using the index @xmath11 .",
    "the estimation of @xmath63  at iteration @xmath11 is denoted with @xmath82 .",
    "in particular , the algorithm evaluates a first image reconstruction using some initialization strategy @xmath83 ( iteration @xmath84 ) .",
    "then , the iterations start .",
    "the intuition is as follows . for each row",
    ", if we are able to reliably predict it using the reconstruction of the upper and lower lines at previous iteration with some linear prediction filter @xmath85 , obtaining @xmath86 , we can compute the `` measurement '' @xmath87 of this prediction by applying matrix @xmath72 to @xmath86 .",
    "then we calculate the prediction error in the linear measurement domain @xmath88 by subtracting this `` predicted measurement '' from the original measurement row @xmath81 .",
    "the error @xmath88 will be then reconstructed using , leading to a prediction error on the signal samples equal to @xmath89 .",
    "adding @xmath89 to @xmath86 provides a new estimate of @xmath90 .",
    "since the new estimate is more accurate than the old one , the process can be repeated by estimating a new , more accurate prediction .",
    "if the prediction of the row is accurate enough , the prediction error is going to be more compressible than the original vector . as a consequence , for an equal number of measurements , the @xmath26 reconstruction will yield lower mse .",
    "we support this claim by numerical simulations , whose results are shown in section  [ sec : pred_err_sparsity ] .",
    "different initialization strategies are described in section  [ sec : init_strat ] , while prediction filters for 2d signals are described in section  [ sec : lp_2d ] . since is a convex problem and the prediction filters we test are linear ,",
    "the overall algorithm can be considered as a projection onto convex sets .",
    "this ensures the convergence of the algorithm to the intersection of the constraint sets ( if any ) @xcite .",

    "common to the various approaches are the signal dimensions , which determine the spatial and spectral resolution of the imaging system .",
    "the spectral resolution is given by the number of individual wavelengths @xmath102 that the system is able to discriminate .",
    "in one possible approach , each wavelength is sensed individually , leading to different measurements for each spectral channel . in another approach ,",
    "the system measures spatial - spectral slices individually , and different wavelengths are separated during the cs reconstruction process . in both cases , we assume that the user intends to acquire or reconstruct each spectral channel with a resolution of @xmath103 pixels . in both cases , we can represent the original data as a cube with two spatial and one spectral dimension , and interpret them either as a collection of @xmath102 spectral channels , or as a collection of @xmath58 spatial - spectral slices . in the following",
    "we take the first approach , and consider an hyperspectral image @xmath104 as a collection of @xmath102 spectral channels @xmath105 , each consisting of a @xmath103 frame , i.e. @xmath106~.\\ ] ]      according to algorithm  [ alg:3d_coding_band_unique ] , for each spectral channel a collection @xmath107 of @xmath48 measurements is acquired as @xmath108 where each sensing matrix @xmath109 is taken as gaussian i.i.d . and @xmath110 . for simplicity",
    ", @xmath48 is taken as the same value for all spectral channels .",
    "the measurements of all channels are then collected in the matrix @xmath71 .",
    "this setting is amenable to separate spatial reconstruction of each spectral channel using a two - dimensional transform as sparsity domain .",
    "however , we expect that separate spatial reconstruction does not yield a sufficiently accurate estimate of the original image , since it lacks modelling of spectral correlation , which is very strong for hyperspectral images .    the hyperspectral image @xmath111 , @xmath48 the measurement matrix @xmath71 draw @xmath72 of size @xmath112 s.t . @xmath65 @xmath113 @xmath114 @xmath71      the idea behind",
    "the iterative reconstruction is that , as in the 2d case , if we can obtain a prediction of a spectral channel @xmath115 , e.g. applying the operator @xmath85 to channels @xmath116 and @xmath117 of some initial reconstruction , then we can cancel out the contribution of this predictor from the measurements of @xmath115 , and reconstruct only the prediction error instead of the full spectral channel .",
    "if the prediction filter is accurate , the prediction error is expected to be more compressible than the full signal , and the reconstruction will yield better results as shown in section  [ sec : pred_err_sparsity ] . in particular , the iterative procedure starts from the initial reconstruction @xmath118 of all spectral channels . at this stage , we do not specify how we generate such initial reconstruction , which is generically denoted by @xmath119 to indicate that it is computed from random projections @xmath120 and measurement matrices @xmath121 . then , for every channel we first obtain @xmath122 .",
    "after that , we compute prediction error measurements as @xmath123 , and we use @xmath88 to reconstruct the @xmath19-th channel summing the cs reconstruction of @xmath88 to @xmath124 .",
    "@xmath125 is the 2d sparsity transform matrix .",

    "again , it is worth noting that since is a convex problem and the prediction filter is linear , this algorithm can be cast in terms of projections onto convex sets @xcite , guaranteeing convergence to the intersection of the constraint sets ( if not empty ) .",

    "for example , the acquisition can be performed for each spectral row ( instead of spectral channels ) , and the reconstruction can be performed iterating over rows .",
    "the respective algorithms can be obtained by algorithms  [ alg:3d_coding_band_unique ] and [ alg:3d_decoding_band_unique ] by properly rotating indexes and dimensions .",

    "the prediction filter operates in a blockwise fashion .",
    "prediction of spectral channel @xmath19 is performed dividing the channel into non - overlapping spatial blocks of size @xmath148 pixels .",
    "each block is predicted from the spatially co - located block in a reference spectral channel @xmath149 ( typically the previous or next band ) .",

    "this one - step prediction filter is employed in such a way as to take full advantage of the correlation between bands . in particular , the current band is very correlated with its two adjacent bands , while the correlation tends to decrease moving further away . eventually , we define a predictor for a block in the current band @xmath115 as the average of two predictors obtained from the previous and the next band . @xmath161 .",
