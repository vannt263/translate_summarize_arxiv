    "to ask how sound waves propagate in a moving fluid is a surprisingly subtle question that rapidly introduces one to the full power and complexity of curved - space lorentzian differential geometry @xcite . a sound wave propagating in a flowing fluid shares many of the properties of a minimally coupled massless scalar field propagating in a non - flat ( 3 + 1)dimensional lorentzian geometry .",
    "this partial isomorphism is the basis of a very useful analogy whereby _ parts _ of general relativity can be identified with _",
    "parts _ of non - relativistic fluid mechanics .",
    "kinematic aspects of gr , such as the existence of event horizons , carry over to fluid mechanics ( event horizons map into the boundaries of regions of supersonic flow ) . dynamic aspects of gr ( the einstein equations ) do _ not _ carry over .",
    "the analogy is not an identity , nevertheless enough features are shared in common to make the model very useful , and rather entertaining .",
    "( since this is a summer school , i will be very pedagogical and will set out a number of exercises as we work through the details . )",
    "the basic idea is to consider a non - relativistic , irrotational , barotropic fluid .",
    "the fluid should be irrotational since in this case the velocity is completely specified by a scalar field , ( which does not have to be single - valued ) : @xmath0 thus there is hope that the sound waves , which we shall soon see are merely linearized fluctuations in the velocity field , can also be described by a scalar field .",
    "there is of course nothing physically wrong with non - scalar sound ( vector sound ? ) but the equations then become so unmanageable as to be completely unwieldy . in the meantime ,",
    "as long as whatever vorticity happens to be present is confined to thin vortex tubes , the present analysis is perfectly capable of handling everything outside the vortex core .",
    "the fluid should be barotropic : the pressure should be a function of the density only .",
    "this requirement makes sure that the pressure forces do not generate vorticity ",
    "it guarantees that an initially irrotational fluid will remain irrotational .",
    "an additional simplifying assumption , for the purposes of this talk , is that the viscosity is zero ( inviscid fluid ) .",
    "this is merely a technical simplification , and the complications attendant on introducing viscosity into the system are already understood  @xcite .",
    "( viscosity acts as an explicit breaking term for the acoustic lorentz invariance , and acoustic lorentz invariance becomes an approximate symmetry that improves in the low - frequency low - wavenumber limit . ) the relevant dynamical equations are : + ( 1 ) the continuity equation @xmath1 ( 2 ) the ( zero - viscosity ) euler equation @xmath2 ( 3 ) some barotropic equation of state @xmath3 ( easy ) check that this is a closed system of equations .",
    "check that if the vorticity is initially zero it will remain so .",
    "now pick some arbitrary but exact solution [ @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 of the equations of motion .",
    "treat this exact solution as a background field and ask how linearized fluctuations around this background behave . write @xmath7 the equations of motion for these linearized fluctuations are @xmath8 here we define @xmath9 , the standard definition for the speed of sound .",
    "derive these equations .",
    "( the second equation , which comes from the euler equation , is a little tricky . )",
    "these three first - order partial differential equations can be assembled into one second - order partial differential equation which carries exactly the same information : @xmath10 this is a second - order partial differential equation for @xmath11 with variable coefficients that depend only on the background field around which we are linearizing .",
    "once a solution @xmath12 has been obtained , the pressure fluctuations @xmath13 and density fluctuations @xmath14 follow directly from the linearized euler equation and the linearized equation of state .",
    "( easy ) check this .    to turn this into a form suitable for obtaining a _ spacetime _ interpretation , introduce four - dimensional coordinates via the usual identification @xmath15",
    "now introduce a @xmath16 matrix @xmath17.\\ ] ] ( greek indices run from @xmath18@xmath19 , while roman indices run from @xmath20@xmath19 . ) define @xmath21^{-1}.\\ ] ] then the rather formidable - looking second - order partial differential equation for @xmath11 can be very simply written as @xmath22 ( straightforward ) check this .",
    "calculate @xmath23 .",
    "show that ( [ e : eom ] ) above is _ identical _ to ( [ e : physical ] ) .",
    "once you have reduced the equations of motion to the form ( [ e : eom ] ) , the last step is trivial : just observe that this equation is exactly that of a minimally coupled massless scalar field propagating in a spacetime with inverse metric @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , the differential operator appearing in this equation is just the dalambertian of the inverse metric @xmath24 .",
    "check that the matrix @xmath25.\\ ] ] is the inverse of @xmath26 .",
    "check that the signature of this matrix is @xmath27 .",
    "thus we have demonstrated that the propagation of sound is governed by an _ acoustic metric _  @xmath28 .",
    "this acoustic metric describes a @xmath29dimensional lorentzian ( pseudo  riemannian ) geometry .",
    "the metric depends _ algebraically _ on the density , velocity of flow , and local speed of sound in the fluid .",
    "this is the essential difference between this acoustic lorentzian geometry and gr : the acoustic metric is governed by the fluid equations of motion ( continuity , euler s equation , and the barotropic equation of state ) which constrain the background geometry , and the einstein equations of gr are not useful in this context .",
    "you can certainly _ calculate _ the ricci tensor and einstein tensor for this acoustic metric , but there is no justification for asking these quantities to satisfy any particular constraint .",
    "note that although the underlying physics ( fluid mechanics ) is completely non - relativistic , sharply separating the notions of space and time , the fluctuations ( sound waves ) nevertheless couple to a spacetime metric that places space and time in a unified framework .",
    "( some tricky points . )",
    "copy / extend the standard definitions of black hole , event horizon , apparent horizon , and surface gravity into this context .",
    "check your ideas against the discussion below , and the more detailed formulation in  @xcite .",
    "a particularly simple example of a non - trivial acoustic geometry is provided by laminar fluid flow through a nozzle  @xcite : as the nozzle narrows the fluid speeds up .",
    "if the nozzle is sufficiently narrow the fluid velocity will exceed the local speed of sound .",
    "( doing this experimentally while maintaining laminar flow is a rather difficult proposition . )",
    "if the fluid velocity exceeds the speed of sound , then sound waves can not escape back out of the region of supersonic flow .",
    "thus a region of supersonic flow shares many of the properties normally associated with a black hole ( more properly , this region shares many of the properties of the ergosphere of a black hole ) .",
    "a draining bathtub , with water swirling around the drain , is a useful model for emphasizing the difference between an event horizon and an ergosphere  @xcite .",
    "as one moves inwards towards the drain , two interesting things happen : first , the magnitude of the fluid velocity exceeds the speed of sound , and second ( somewhat nearer the drain ) the _ radial component _ of the fluid velocity exceeds the speed of sound .",
    "the region in which the fluid velocity exceeds the speed of sound defines the ergoregion .",
    "( it is impossible to stand still in the ergoregion without producing a sonic boom . )",
    "once the radial component of the velocity exceeds the speed of sound , then acoustic disturbances can not escape from the region around the drain , and this defines the event horizon .",
    "if the motion is perfectly radial , ( no swirling ) the two notions agree .",
    "it is only if there is a swirling motion near the drain that the two notions need to be separated .",
    "this is the analog for fluid dynamics of the gr behaviour of the metric near a rotating black hole : for the kerr metric the dragging of inertial frames implies that the region in which one can not remain at rest with respect to asymptotic infinity [ the ergoregion ] is not the same as the region from which you can not escape to asymptotic infinity .",
    "it is experimentally very easy to set up a situation in which air bubbles in water are induced to collapse at supersonic speeds .",
    "( speeds of up to mach 4 are quite common . )",
    "supersonic bubble collapse provides an example of an apparent horizon ( not an event horizon ) .",
    "it s an apparent horizon because simply by waiting for bubble collapse to stop , and the re - expansion phase to start , you can always be guaranteed of getting a sound signal back out to spatial infinity  thus there can not be a true event horizon ( absolute horizon ) in the system .",
    "furthermore , this apparent horizon can exist for only a very short time during each collapse cycle : by construction , the apparent horizon lasts for less than one sound - crossing time .",
    "experiments of this type are normally set up to investigate the phenomenon of _",
    "before anyone gets too carried away , let me state explicitly that the visible light emitted in sonoluminescence is not hawking radiation associated with this apparent horizon : ( 1 ) if anything , you should expect phonons , not photons  @xcite ; ( 2 ) the `` hawking temperature '' estimated from the acceleration of the bubble wall , while somewhat larger than the most naive estimates based on unruh s analysis  @xcite , is still far too small to be relevant for sonoluminescence  @xcite ; ( 3 ) the fact that the apparent horizon lasts for less than one sound - crossing time renders hawking s calculation moot . see below for more discussion of acoustic hawking radiation .",
    "can we find a fluid flow that exactly mimics the schwarzschild geometry ?",
    "no , but we can get reasonably close : we can find a fluid flow that has an acoustic metric that is conformal to that of schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "start by writing the schwarzschild geometry in gullstrand form @xcite @xmath30 in this coordinate system the schwarzschild geometry has been written in such a way that _",
    "space _ is flat , though _",
    "spacetime _ is curved .",
    "find the coordinate transformation needed to go from any of the more usual representations of schwarzschild spacetime to this one .",
    "demonstrate that for any spherically symmetric geometry ( not necessarily static , though you may want to consider that special case first ) it is always possible to find a coordinate system such that _ space _ is flat .",
    "( so all the spacetime curvature can be forced into the @xmath31 and @xmath32 components of the metric . )",
    "take the general acoustic metric .",
    "pick @xmath33 a position - independent constant , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . check that this fluid flow satisfies the equation of continuity  @xcite .",
    "find the equation of state .",
    "find the background pressure distribution needed to satisfy the euler equation .",
    "demonstrate that for this choice of fluid flow @xmath36 finally , show that this is the best that can be done  @xcite .",
    "in the same way that one can define a surface gravity for a black hole in general relativity , it is also possible to set up a notion of surface gravity for an acoustic black hole .",
    "unruh showed  @xcite that under certain conditions the surface gravity is related to the normal derivative of the fluid velocity as it crosses the event horizon , and is then equal to the physical acceleration of the fluid as it crosses the event horizon .",
    "@xmath37 unfortunately , this result is limited to the case where ( 1 ) the speed of sound is position independent , and ( 2 ) the fluid crosses the event horizon perpendicularly ( which means the event horizon must be identical to the ergoregion ) .",
    "the general result , derived in  @xcite , is @xmath38 so a position dependent speed of sound , or a non - trivial ergoregion , greatly complicates life .",
    "there are a large number of technical incantations required to justify these formulae .",
    "consider a null geodesic that just skims the acoustic event horizon , and parameterize it by non - relativistic newtonian time .",
    "show that this parameter is not an affine parameter for the null geodesic , and show that the surface gravity measures the extent to which newtonian time fails to be an affine parameter . for more details",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "with the build up we have seen so far , the discussion of acoustic hawking radiation  @xcite is almost anticlimactic , and can be relegated to a series of exercises .",
    "read the _ original _ paper demonstrating the existence of hawking radiation ( the one in nature  @xcite , compare with  @xcite ) . check that this derivation does not need or use the einstein equations .",
    "( the key feature of this original derivation is that the black hole is quasi - static : there should be an apparent horizon that lasts for a long time compared to the light - crossing time for the black hole . )",
    "compare this with some of the subsequent rederivations of the hawking radiation effect .",
    "for example , using analytic continuation to euclidean signature",
    ". later derivations are technically slicker ( and more computationally efficient ) but often obscure the underlying physics .",
    "verify that an acoustic black hole will emit a quasi - thermal _ phonon _ spectrum with temperature @xmath39 near the horizon , the spectrum is almost exactly thermal .",
    "as the phonons move away from the event horizon they are to some extent back - scattered by the acoustic metric .",
    "exactly the same phenomenon occurs in gr and is the origin of the famous grey - body factors  even for a schwarzschild black hole the emission spectrum is not exactly planckian .    put in some numbers .",
    "verify that @xmath40 \\left [ { 1\\over c_s } { \\partial ( c_s - v_\\perp ) \\over",
    "n } \\right].\\ ] ] thus for supersonic flow of water through a 1 mm nozzle , @xmath41 .",
    "if this number was just a little bit better , we could reasonably hope to build laboratory experiments to verify this acoustic hawking effect .",
    "temperatures of @xmath42 kelvin are not by themselves completely out of reach , though you would certainly not be using water as the working fluid .",
    "the real issue is that of detecting a thermal phonon spectrum at this temperature , while maintaining laminar supersonic flow for the working fluid .",
    "verify that the existence of hawking radiation is a purely kinematic effect . hawking",
    "radiation will occur in any lorentzian geometry that contains an event horizon , independent of what the dynamical equations underlying the geometry are .",
    "see for instance  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to hawking radiation , which is a purely kinematic effect , the notion of black hole entropy is intimately tied up with the dynamics of the geometry .",
    "in fact , if the dynamics of the geometry is governed by a lagrangian that depends only on the metric ( and thus implicitly on the riemann tensor of the metric ) then there is a rather general formula for black hole entropy  @xcite @xmath43 here the integral runs over the two - dimensional event horizon , and @xmath44 denotes the two - dimensional levi - civita symbol defined on the event horizon . in particular , suppose ( for simplicity ) that we have @xmath45 then for a spherically symmetric black hole @xmath46 this example is enough to drive home a key point : entropy equals area ( plus corrections ) _ if and only if _ the lagrangian is einstein  hilbert ( plus corrections )  @xcite .",
    "so calculations of black hole entropy are implicitly calculations of the lagrangian governing the geometry  @xcite .    there are some interesting quirks of history here : historically bekenstein s notion of black hole entropy came first , and hawking radiation was discovered as a side effect of trying to make the notion of black hole entropy consistent with ordinary thermodynamics .",
    "but now we see that hawking radiation is a much more primitive concept , one that is more fundamental than the black hole entropy it helped explain .",
    "in fact hawking radiation makes perfectly good sense even in situations in which the notion of black hole entropy is entirely meaningless  @xcite .",
    "this also has implications for string theory  @xcite : we have known since the mid 1980 s that the low - energy ( sub - planckian ) limit of essentially any string theory is a theory of curved spacetime with dynamical equations derived from an action that is the einstein ",
    "hilbert action ( plus corrections ) .",
    "thus in _ any _ phenomenologically interesting string theory black holes must have an entropy that is proportional to the area ( plus corrections ) . in a certain sense , complicated state - counting calculations in the underlying string theory can be viewed as consistency checks that verify that the low - energy dynamics is what you thought it was .",
    "there are suspicions , though not a complete proof , that it might be able to formalize this statement by rephrasing the state - counting calculations directly in terms of the low - energy degrees of freedom .",
    "see for instance the horowitz ",
    "polchinski `` correspondence principle ''  @xcite or carlip s  @xcite and solodukhin s  @xcite analysis in terms of a the central charge of an appropriate virasoro algebra attached to the event horizon .",
    "the acoustic model for lorentzian spacetime is a very good toy model for forcing you to think long an hard about fundamental issues in gr ( and fluid mechanics , and even string theory ) .",
    "it forces you to sharply separate those aspects of black hole physics that are purely kinematical from those parts that are intrinsically dynamical .",
    "it forces you to think about the universality of lorentzian geometry : even completely non - relativistic fluid dynamics has a lorentzian spacetime hiding inside it .",
    "it allows you to formulate in a coherent manner possible approaches to the breakdown of lorentz invariance ( though i have not said anything about this topic in this talk ) .",
