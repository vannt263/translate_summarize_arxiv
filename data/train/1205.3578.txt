    "a temperature - dependent , _ full _ model for ( rate - dependent ) damage has been addressed in @xcite as well , with local - in - time existence results .",
    "the main difficulties attached to the analysis of system  are :    the _ elliptic degeneracy _ of the momentum equation : in particular , we allow for the positive coefficients @xmath112 and @xmath113 to tend to zero simultaneously ;    the _ highly nonlinear coupling _ between the single equations , resulting in the the quadratic terms @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 in the heat and phase equations and , respectively ;    the _ poor regularity _ of the temperature variable , which brings about difficulties in dealing with the coupling between equations and when we consider the thermal expansion terms ( i.e. we take @xmath117 ) ;    the _ doubly nonlinear _ character of , due to the nonsmooth graph @xmath118 and the nonlinear operator @xmath119 ( which on the other hand has a key regularizing role ) .",

    "is in fact to _",
    "prevent it_. specifically , we have shown that , if the initial datum @xmath126 stays away from the values points @xmath10 and @xmath11 , so does @xmath2 during this evolution , guaranteeing that the operators in are uniformly elliptic .",
    "separation property _ is proved by exploiting a sufficient coercivity of @xmath81 at the thresholds @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which for example holds true for the logarithmic potential .    in @xcite",
    "an _ isothermal _ ( irreversible ) model for damage has been considered : therein , because of the elliptic degeneracy of , the authors only prove a local - in - time existence result . for ( isothermal ) _ rate - independent _ damage models @xcite , the results change significantly : in this realm , only poor time - regularity of the solution component @xmath2 is to be expected , because the @xmath11-homogeneous dissipation contribution in @xmath28 to @xmath31 just ensures @xmath127-estimates for the function @xmath128 .",
    "that is why , one has to resort to the aforementioned notion of _ energetic solution _",
    "@xcite , in which no time - derivatives of @xmath2 are featured .",

    "this technique can not be applied to system . nonetheless , let us mention that a key assumption in @xcite is a suitable growth of the heat conductivity @xmath101 . following @xcite , here",
    "we will combine it with conditions on the heat capacity coefficient @xmath130 to handle the quadratic nonlinearities @xmath114 and @xmath115 in .    due to the lack of  good \" a priori estimates for @xmath0 mentioned in * 3 ) * , we will not be able to encompass in our analysis the case of a non - constant thermal expansion coefficient @xmath95 , e.g. @xmath131 , which would still be interesting for damage @xcite .",

    "it consists of a _ one - sided _ variational inequality ( i.e.  with test functions having a fixed sign ) , and of an _ energy inequality _ , see later .      unlike @xcite ,",
    "here we shall not enforce separation of @xmath2 from the threshold values @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and accordingly we will allow for general initial configurations of @xmath2 .",
    "then , it is not to be expected that either of the coefficients @xmath112 and @xmath113 stay away from @xmath10 , which results in the elliptic degeneracy of the displacement equation . to handle it , we shall approximate system  with a non - degenerating one , where we replace with @xmath136 let us note that , to rule out the degeneracy , it is sufficient to truncate away from zero only the coefficient @xmath112 of the _ viscous _ part of the elliptic operator in the momentum equation . however , for technical reasons which will become apparent in section [ sec:5 ] ( cf .",

    "<S> for such an approximate system , global - in - time existence and well - posedness results are established in various cases . </S>",
    "<S> then , the passage to the limit to the degenerate system is performed via suitable variational techniques .    * key words:*phase transitions , damage phenomena , thermoviscoelastic materials , elliptic degenerate operators , nonlocal operators , global existence of weak solutions , continuous dependence .    * </S>",
