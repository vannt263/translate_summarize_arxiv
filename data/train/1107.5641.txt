    "the last missing piece of the sm , the higgs boson , would be discovered or ruled out sooner or later and new physics signals beyond the sm are expected to appear for the first time . among the most striking events that the lhc would reveal",
    "is the formation of mini black holes",

    ", the lhc experiments can probe the strong gravity regime and possibly produce black holes @xcite .",
    "typical size of the schwarzschild radius of these black holes is @xmath3 fm and they are called as mini black holes .",
    "mini black holes also evaporate through hawking radiation @xcite just as ordinary black holes .",
    "the lifetime of a mini black hole is typically about @xmath4 so the black hole decays instantaneously .",
    "once the black hole is produced at the lhc one can detect its creation by observing hawking radiation .",
    "it is also possible that rotating or charged black holes would be produced . for these reasons",
    "there have been many studies on the emission of particles by mini black holes , both static and rotating ones in extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "when particles are scattered off by rotating ( or kerr ) black holes a very interesting phenomenon known as superradiance occurs .",
    "if a field of the form @xmath5 is incident on a rotating black hole of angular velocity @xmath6 , the field is amplified if @xmath7 . in this case",
    "the rotation energy is transferred to the scattered field . for",
    "any rotating objects the superradiance can occur .",
    "if the rotating black hole is surrounded by a mirror which reflects the scattered field back to the black hole , the field bounces back and forth between the black hole and the mirror . during the process the field amplifies itself and the extracted energy from the rotating black hole grows exponentially .",
    "this is so called the press - teukolsky black - hole bomb @xcite .",
    "the origin of the black - hole bomb is the small imaginary part of @xmath8 . in the case of superradiance where @xmath7 , the imaginary part is positive",
    "so the field contains the term of exponential increasing with time , @xmath9 . the mirror which reflects the field needs not be a real one .",
    "for example , a mass term of the field in 4-dimensional spacetime can play a role of the mirror . in this case",
    "the massive field forms a bound state with the black hole , and the superradiance results in the instability of the black hole .",
    "there have been many works on the black - hole bomb where a massive particle is bound to a celestial black hole under superradiance @xcite . for the higher dimensional kerr black holes",
    ", it was shown that they do not exhibit such instabilities for massive fields because there are no bound geodesics in the spacetime around the black hole @xcite .",
    "in a recent work @xcite i have investigated the possibility of black - hole bombs at the lhc .",
    "the work is a higher dimensional version of @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the superradiance of a massive scalar field by a rotating black hole in higher dimensions with the mirror boundary condition is analyzed .",
    "as shown in @xcite the mass term would not be enough for the role of mirror and probably electromagnetic fields might work out for charged particles , but to focus on the possibility of forming a black - hole bomb , the mirror boundary condition was simply imposed without considering any technical concerns about it .",
    "it was assumed that the mirror boundary condition is simply given by whatever reflects the scattered particle back to the black hole .",
    "current work is an extension of @xcite . in this work we analyzed the bulk emission as well as the brane emission .",
    "intuitively the bulk emission modes are expected to be suppressed compared with the brane emission , and we will see that this is really the case by a factor of @xmath10 .",
    "we also investigate the different angular modes for different masses .    in the next section the superradiance of massive scalar particles by rotating black holes in higher dimensions with the mirror boundary condition",
