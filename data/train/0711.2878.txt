    "this result seems natural within the fisher - huse droplet theory @xcite where the interface energy is a sum of random terms that follow some central limit asymptotic behavior .",
    "this picture is confirmed by the gaussian distribution of the random variable @xmath200 , and by the conventional behavior exactly at criticality @xmath241 however , the presence of another length scale @xmath7 that diverges with a greater exponent @xmath242 remains to be better understood , in particular if one compares with the spin - glass transition . in the spin - glass case , @xmath7 appearing in the random contribution of the free - energy is considered as the true correlation length , since this is the leading term in the free - energy in this case .",
    "but then the interface energy is governed by some critical chaos exponent @xmath243 exactly at criticality , with @xmath244 , in contrast with the conventional behavior of eq .",
    "[ enertcconclusion ] .",
    "so in both cases , even if the physical interpretation is different , one needs two different diverging length scales to describe the critical behaviors of the random contributions of the free - energy and energy or entropy .",

    "[ freeconclusion ] .",
    "within one disordered sample , the random variable @xmath245 strongly depends on the temperature , and this is why the energy and the entropy of the interface presents fluctuations that are not directly related to the scalings appearing in the free - energy .",
    "more precisely , the entropy can be obtained as a derivative of the free - energy with respect to temperature @xmath246 ( and similarly the energy reads @xmath247 ) .",
    "the first term is the extensive term , the second term is only of order @xmath248 , and thus we conclude that the fluctuation term of order @xmath249 with @xmath4 present in the entropy and in the energy ( eq . [ enerdp ] ) has for origin the derivative of the random variable @xmath245 .",
    "the identification of these two terms yields @xmath250 i.e. the derivative @xmath251 is of order @xmath252 where @xmath253 is the chaos exponent of the zero - temperature fixed point .",
    "let us now consider the singularity of the prefactor @xmath254 as @xmath255 . if one defines a chaos length @xmath11 via @xmath256 one obtains that this chaos length @xmath11 diverges more slowly than the correlation length .",
    "more precisely , in the random ferromagnetic case , using @xmath257 and @xmath258 , one obtains the singularity @xmath259 so here the difference in scaling between the chaos length @xmath11 and the correlation length @xmath8 comes from the difference between @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in the spin - glass case , using @xmath260 and @xmath261 , one obtains the singularity @xmath262 here , the difference in scaling between the chaos length @xmath11 and the correlation length @xmath8 comes from the difference @xmath263 .    in conclusion , beyond the differences in interpretation concerning the nature of the transition in disordered ferromagnets ( where the true correlation length is @xmath8 associated to the non - random term of the free - energy , and where the interface energy presents conventional scaling at criticality @xmath264 ) and in spin - glasses ( where the true correlation length is @xmath7 associated to the random term of the free - energy , and where the interface energy presents non - conventional scaling at criticality @xmath265 with a critical chaos exponent @xmath244 ) , the common feature seems to be that in both cases",
    ", the characteristic length scale @xmath11 associated with the chaotic nature of the low - temperature phase , diverges more slowly than the correlation length .",
    "note that for spin - glasses , nifle and hilhorst have found that the inequality @xmath10 is satisfied in a finite range of dimensions @xmath266 above the lower critical dimension @xmath267 , whereas for @xmath268 , the usual scaling laws in terms of the correlation length exponent @xmath37 are valid @xcite . in disordered ferromagnets , one may similarly wonder whether the different singularities in @xmath8 and @xmath7 exist only in a finite range of dimensions @xmath266 .",
    "it would be nice to clarify in which conditions the critical point of a disordered model is described by a single diverging length scale or by two diverging length scales .",
