    "the radio - loud active galactic nucleus ( agn ) centaurus a ( ngc 5128 ) is one of the most extensively studied agns at all wave bands , thanks to its proximity ( distance of @xmath4 mpc , rejkuba 2004 ; 1@xmath5 = 1 kpc ) and brightness ( 210 kev flux typically @xmath62 @xmath010@xmath7 erg @xmath2 s@xmath8 ) .",
    "cen a features the nearest agn jet and is considered a prototypical fr i radio galaxy .",
    "its radio structure consists of extended kpc - scale outer , middle , and inner radio lobes , fed by a one - sided kpc - scale jet .",

    "1998 ; see also israel 1998 for a review ) .",
    "the host galaxy of cen a is a giant elliptical with a pronounced optical dust lane that obscures the inner few kpc and is believed to be an edge - on disk structure ( quillen et al .",
    "the inner dust disk , with associated young stars , h ii regions , and other ionized gas , is the site of vigorous star formation , e.g. , observed along the edges of the inner disk ( e.g. , ebneter & balick 1983 , dufour et al .",
    "the dust disk is interpreted as the result of a merger between a large elliptical and a gas - rich disk galaxy at least a gyr ago ( e.g. , israel 1998 ) .",

    "1999 ) have established the presence of a non - thermal , power - law continuum whose origin is not certain .",
    "it could be a signature of accretion , or it could be associated with jet emission processes , e.g. , synchrotron or inverse compton emission from the sub - pc vlbi jet .    below @xmath64 kev , the x - ray continuum emission undergoes moderately heavily absorption , although the nature of the x - ray obscuring material is not certain ; i.e. , it could have a sky - covering fraction of 1 as seen from the central x - ray source or it could be in the form of a dusty torus .",
    "rothschild et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have noted @xmath650@xmath13 variations in the absorbing column over @xmath620 years , and suggested that the nucleus is seen through the edges of a warped , rotating disk . the strong x - ray absorption makes cen a relatively unique : the vast majority of fr i radio galaxies possess relatively weak x - ray absorbing columns ( @xmath14 10@xmath15 @xmath2 ) .",

    "rosat _ and _ asca _ , turner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggested that one plausible description of the nuclear emission is a partial - covering model , wherein the nucleus is seen through three layers of absorption : 40@xmath13 , 59@xmath13 , and 1@xmath13 of the nuclear emission is obscured by columns of 4 , 1 and 0.01 @xmath0 10@xmath1 @xmath2 , respectively . using _",

    "there is a prominent fe k@xmath3 emission line at 6.4 kev , first noted by mushotzky et al .",
    "it is narrow ( e.g. , fwhm = 2200@xmath16900 km s@xmath8 , evans et al .",
    "2004 ) , and its flux is historically nearly constant despite long - term continuum variations spanning a factor of @xmath65 over 20 years ( rothschild et al .  1999 ) , implying an origin for the line that is distant from the origin of the variable continuum .    the soft x - ray emission within @xmath66 kpc of the nucleus of cen a consists of both diffuse and point - like emission .",
    "there is diffuse emission associated with the kpc - scale jet extending from @xmath17 60 pc to the ne radio lobe ( e.g. , kraft et al .",

    "point - like emission is associated with several dozen knots in the kpc - scale jet ( e.g. , kataoka et al .",
    "2006 ) as well as from a population of x - ray binaries ( e.g. , kraft et al .",
    "2000 ) . a soft x - ray spectrum covering the inner few kpc is thus expected to contain both power - law continuum emission from the jet and point - like sources and line - like emission associated with the thermal gas .",

    "the combination of the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) ccd and the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ) instruments have yielded a broadband spectrum covering 0.3 to 250 kev , allowing us to deconvolve the various broadband emitting and absorbing components in this object .",
    "furthermore , the exceptional response of the xis ccd and high signal - to - noise ratio of this observation allow us to study narrow emission lines in great detail .",

    "the nucleus of cen a was observed by _ suzaku _ from 2005 august 19 at 03:30 ut until august 20 at 09:50 ut , and in fact was the first light target for the hxd .",
    "_ suzaku _ was launched 2005 july 10 into a low - earth orbit .",
    "it has four x - ray telescopes ( xrts ; serlemitsos et al .",

    "three ccds ( xis0 , 2 , and 3 ) are front - illuminated ( fi ) , the fourth ( xis1 ) is back - illuminated ( bi ) and features an enhanced soft x - ray response .",
    "the xrt / xis combination yields effective areas per detector of roughly 330 @xmath19 ( fi ) or 370 @xmath19 ( bi ) at 1.5 kev , and 160 @xmath19 ( fi ) or 110 @xmath19 ( bi ) at 8 kev .",
    "each xis is equipped with two @xmath20fe calibration sources that produce fluorescent mn k@xmath3 and k@xmath21 lines and are located at the ccd corners .",

    "the xis data used in this paper were version 0.7 of the screened data ( fujimoto et al .",
    "2007 ) provided by the _",
    "suzaku _ team .",
    "the screening is based on the following criteria : grade 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 events were used , the cleansis script was used to remove hot or flickering pixels , data collected within 256 s of passage through the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) were discarded , and data were selected to be 5@xmath9 in elevation above the earth rim ( 20@xmath9 above the day - earth rim ) .",
    "the xis fi ccds were in 2x2 , 3x3 and 5x5 editmodes , for a net exposure time after screening of 71.5 ( xis0 ) , 70.3 ( xis2 ) and 68.6 ( xis3 ) ks .",
    "xis1 was in 3x3 and 5x5 modes , for a net exposure of 68.6 ks .",
    "the source was observed at the nominal center position of the xis .",
    "the xis was kept in normal mode , but to reduce the risk of photon - pileup , the 1/4 window option was used : each ccd recorded 256 by 1024 pixel rows , with a readout time of 2 s , as opposed to 8 s when the full 1024 by 1024 window is used . for each xis",
    ", we extracted a 2@xmath5 radius centered on the source .",
    "spectra were binned to a minimum of 50 counts bin@xmath8 to allow use of the @xmath22 statistic .",
    "the count rates observed over the full xis band were 5.0 ct s@xmath8 ( average of xis0 , 2 and 3 ) or 4.3 ct s@xmath8 ( xis bi ) .",
    "these count rates are far below the limit for photon - pileup in 1/4 window mode , @xmath6 12.5 ct s@xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , extracting over annular regions with inner and outer radii of 0.4@xmath5 and 2@xmath5 , respectively , yielded spectra identical in shape to those extracted over 2@xmath5 circular regions , indicating that pile - up was negligible .    because the soft diffuse emission in cen a covers nearly the entire read - out area of the ccd , we used observations of the north ecliptic pole ( nep ) to extract a background spectrum .",
    "_ suzaku _ observed the nep on 2005 september 2 to 4 .",
    "there was a brief , sharp flare during the nep observation , consistent with evidence for solar wind charge exchange emission ( see fujimoto et al .",
    "2007 ) . removing that flare and applying the same screening criteria as above yielded a net exposure time of 93.9 ( xis0 ) , 108.5 ( xis1 ) , 93.3 ( xis2 ) , and 96.6 ( xis3 ) ks .",
    "we extracted data over a 2@xmath5 circle .",
    "the nep is known to contain soft x - ray emission lines ( see e.g. , fujimoto et al .",
    "2007 ) , but they are much fainter than those of cen a ( see @xmath23 ) .",

    "lines near 0.80.9 kev such as fe l xvii and ne ix in cen a are typically @xmath660 ( 100 ) times brighter in cen a compared to the nep as seen in the xis bi ( xis fis ) .",
    "average 0.52.0 kev count rates for the nep observation were 0.004 , 0.009 , 0.004 , and 0.003 count s@xmath8 for xis0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively ; average 210 kev count rates were 0.005 , 0.012 , 0.005 , and 0.004 count s@xmath8 , respectively .",
    "response matrices and ancillary response files ( arfs ) were generated for each xis independently using xissimrmfgen and xissimarfgen version 2006 - 10 - 26 ( ishisaki et al .",
    "the arf generator takes into account the level of hydrocarbon contamination on the optical blocking filter . however , the cen a observation occurred very early in the _ suzaku _ mission , and the level of contamination was quite low : we estimate a carbon column density of only @xmath60.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 and 0.5@xmath010@xmath24 @xmath2 for xis0 , 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "a consequence of observing with the 1/4 window option is that there are no @xmath20fe calibration source lines on the ccd .",
    "this leads to a higher systematic uncertainty in the energy scale compared to normal mode ( where it is a few tenths of a percent at most ) . to estimate the instrument resolution , we used the calibration source lines from a 77 ks observation of mcg6 - 30 - 15 , observed in normal mode with no window option immediately prior to cen a. we fit the calibration source spectra with three gaussians .",
    "two gaussians were for the mn k@xmath3 doublet ( expected energies 5.899 kev and 5.888 kev ) , with energy centroids fixed to be 11 ev apart , and the higher energy line flux set to twice that of the lower energy one .",
    "the third gaussian was used to model the k@xmath21 line , expected at 6.490 kev .",
    "we found the average of all the calibration line widths @xmath25 to be 9@xmath26 ev ; residual width may be due e.g. , to imperfect cti correction .",
    "the positional accuracy of _ suzaku _ is @xmath61@xmath5 at present , as the spacecraft has been known to exhibit small attitude variations ( `` wobble '' ) .",
    "we checked to make sure that the effect of these attitude variations was not significant , given that the 1/4 window option was used throughout the observation .",

    "the model utilized the count rate of upper discriminators as the measure of cosmic ray flux that passed through the silicon pin diode and yielded background spectra based on a database of non x - ray background observations with the pin ( fukazawa et al .",
    "2007 ) . the systematic uncertainty of the pin is expected to be @xmath175@xmath13 .",
    "however , we note that cen a is one of the brightest agns in the pin energy range , and the effect of background subtraction error on the net source spectrum is relatively small .",

    "the low @xmath66 value could of course indicate the absence of a large amount of compton - thick material that is brightly illuminated by the primary continuum and also efficiently radiates the reflection continuum .",
    "an alternate suggestion is that the compton hump is diluted by a power - law component , e.g. , from one of the jets .",

    "in addition , wozniak et al .  ( 1998 ) demonstrated that spectral fitting of several radio galaxies that also displayed weak or non - existent compton humps is inconsistent with this notion .      assuming that the line originates in gas that is in virialized orbit around the black hole , we can estimate the distance @xmath106 from the black hole to the fe k@xmath3 line - emitting gas .",

    "@xmath114 is the covering fraction , initially assumed to be 1.0 .",

    "we note that the fainter power - law component can not reproduce the entire fe line as @xmath71 is too large ; the primary power law must be responsible for the bulk of the line .",
    "finally , @xmath120 is the photoionization cross section assuming absorption by k - shell electrons only ; all cross sections were taken from veigele ( 1973verner / photo.html ] ) .",
    "@xmath97 is the column density .",
    "the two hard x - ray absorbing components in model 8 have column densities 1.5 and 7 @xmath0 10@xmath1 @xmath2 , which attenuate power laws with normalizations in a 5.3:1 ratio .",

    "assuming isotropic emission , @xmath114 = 0.7 ( @xmath43 = 1.0 ) or 0.6 ( @xmath43=1.17 ) may fit the data .",
    "such values would be more consistent with an origin in a disk as opposed to a shell completely surrounding the core .",
    "( 2 ) the illuminating x - ray continuum may be anisotropic .",
    "for instance , rothschild et al .  (",
    "2006 ) found that @xmath122 was not correlated with @xmath97 and suggested that the line - emitting gas may lie along the vlbi jet some distance from the black hole .",
    "( 3 ) the line - emitting gas may be responding to an illuminating flux that is @xmath60.6 of the observed flux .",
    "this is possible , for instance , if the line - emitting gas is @xmath104200 light - days from the x - ray continuum origin , and does not lie on our line of sight to the continuum origin ; the observed line flux is a response to the continuum flux convolved with a @xmath44200-day time delay . _ swift_/bat monitoring indicates that the average 14195 kev flux of cen a in early 2005 was very roughly 15@xmath13 higher compared to the flux in 2005 august ( private communcation from the _ swift _ team in 2007 ) , possibly explaining some of the line flux discrepancy .",
    "continued long - term monitoring of the continuum and line fluxes may shed light on this issue .",
    "alternatively , the line of sight from the continuum origin to the line - emitting gas may be blocked , by a clump of gas that absorbs 40@xmath13 of the @xmath447 kev flux and that does not lie along our line of sight to the continuum .",
    "( 4 ) it is plausible that our initial assumption of a uniform - column density absorber is incorrect and the absorbers are instead clumpy ; this is more consistent with the observation of two different columns",
    ". there could be higher columns lying out of our line of sight to the x - ray continuum source .",
    "for instance , we can use eq .  1 of wozniak et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which gives the expected fe k@xmath3 intensity assuming a cloud with a column @xmath104 10@xmath1 @xmath2 lying off the line of sight and subtending a fraction @xmath123 of the sky as seen from the source , as a function of the k edge optical depth and the spectral index and normalization of the illuminating continuum .",
    "we find that a solid angle of @xmath123 @xmath6 0.5 yields a predicted line intensity compatible with what _ suzaku",
    "_ observes .",
    "such a covering fraction suggests a torus or some sort of infinite slab , e.g. , a disk - like structure , although the current data can not constrain whether such a disk would be in the form of a `` standard '' optically - thick , geometrically - thin disk at all radii or a `` disk + sphere '' hybrid ( e.g. , esin , mcclintock & narayan 1997 ) , wherein the inner parts of a standard thin disk are replaced by a radiatively - inefficient flow such as an advection dominated accretion flow ( narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "the _ suzaku _ xis has yielded the best soft x - ray spectrum obtained to date for cen a , revealing emission lines that likely originate in the thermal plasma that extends from the nucleus to a radius of @xmath66 kpc .",
    "at least the inner parts of the gas are likely heated by the agn central engine and/or the nuclear starburst ; osullivan , ponman & collins ( 2003 ) demonstrated that the gas in the central 2 kpc of cen a has a much higher temperature then the @xmath442 to 14 kpc gas in the halo .",
    "photoionization does not yield as good a fit to the _ suzaku _ data as collisional ionization models , as the former can not reproduce the strong observed fe l emission complex . specifically , to obtain a good model fit , we have assumed that the emission is entirely collisional in nature , and used a two - temperature vapec model with @xmath59 near 0.2 and 0.6 kev .",
    "this is similar to results obtained in a wide variety of spiral and starburst galaxies ( see references in strickland et al .",
    "2004 ) . however , we are likely sampling thermal emission from plasma spanning a range of temperatures . for example , the soft x - rays are likely not completely dominated by emission from gas with @xmath59 above 0.6 kev , or else we would detect a h - like mg line at least as intense as the he - like mg line , and the he - like ne line would be extremely faint . similarly ,",
    "emission from gas with @xmath59 @xmath17 0.20 kev does not dominate , as the ne x would be extremely faint .",
    "we have derived estimates of @xmath74 , @xmath73 , and @xmath43 using the k shell edge depths , and estimates of @xmath75 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 from the thermal plasma ( for the remainder of this paper , we assume that the abundances in the extended thermal plasma and in the circumnuclear absorbing material are identical )",
    ".    we can also estimate abundances relative to fe , e.g. , @xmath124/@xmath43 , from the k@xmath3 fluorescent lines and eq .  1",
    ". values of @xmath115 were taken from the x - ray data booklet .",
    "for ni and ca , @xmath116 = 0.89 and 0.88 , respectively , assuming neutral atoms ( bambynek et al .  1972 ) .",
    "we assume @xmath116 = 0.9 for all other elements .",
    "the values of @xmath121 , calculated assuming solar abundances and a covering fraction @xmath114=1.0 , are listed in table 3 .",
    "relative abundances are calculated as , e.g. , @xmath124/@xmath43 = ( @xmath125/@xmath126 ) / ( @xmath127/@xmath128 ) , where @xmath128 has been estimated using the abundance derived from the fe k edge depth , @xmath43=1.17 , and the solar abundance was used for @xmath126 .",
    "we caution that for ar , ca , and ni , the lines are weak and the statistics are poor . for si , there may be systematic effects due to current xis calibration as well as from the fact that the continuum near 1.7 kev is a mixture of all three power - law components .",
    "table 5 lists the abundance ratios .",
    "there is agreement on the values of @xmath74/@xmath43 derived from the edges and from the lines .",
    "we observe [ m / h ] = log(@xmath43 ) = + 0.1 , a slightly higher metallicity value than in the metal - rich population of globular clusters at 220 kpc radii ( [ m / h ] @xmath129 , peng et al .",
    "2004 ) or in the outer stellar bulge component ( e.g. , [ m / h ] @xmath6 0.2 at a radius of 8 kpc , harris & harris 2002 ) .",
    "there have been previous indications of high metallicities in the central regions of cen a , i.e. , indications of overabundances of n and o in young h ii regions in the inner few kpc ( moellenhoff 1981 ) .",
    "our observed [ m / h ] value is only slightly higher than values for the ism of other early - type galaxies ( humphrey & buote 2006 ) .",
    "it is similar to values for the stellar components of large ellipticals in general , [ m / h ] @xmath130 ( henry & worthey 1999 ) .",
    "trager et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also found the stellar populations of eight field ellipticals to have [ m / h ] @xmath130 , though it may not be straightforward to compare cen a to field ellipticals due to cen a s recent merger .",
    "our observed value of @xmath131 is consistent with the value of 2 obtained by peng et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for cen a s globular clusters .",
    "however , our observed [ m / h ] value is much higher than the average value ( of a very wide distribution ) found in the halo stars of cen a , [ m / h ] = 0.4 at radii of 2030 kpc ( harris & harris 2000 , harris , harris & poole 1999 ) .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that the circumnuclear material and the diffuse plasma have directly originated in the relatively metal - poor outer halo , unless enrichment via local star formation has occurred .",
    "the premerger origin of the circumnuclear material can not be known for certain , although it is plausible that during the merger , gaseous material originally in the outer portions of the progenitor galaxies lost sufficient angular momentum to be transported to the nuclear regions ( toomre & toomre 1972 ) .",
    "furthermore , connections between the nuclear gas and starburst activity at radii of hundreds of pc and less are well - known ( e.g. , hopkins et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) .",
    "the likelihood that cen a s circumnuclear gas has been enriched due to starburst processes is therefore high .",
    "the degree of metallicity enrichment depends on many factors , including the imf , star formation rate , and the total gas consumed , but simulations of disk - disk mergers incorporating star formation by mihos & hernquist ( 1994 ) demonstrated that [ m / h ] values of 0.30.4 at the center of the resulting merged ellipticals are plausible .",
    "the metallicity value derived from the _ suzaku _ data is consistent with enrichment due to the ongoing star formation in the inner bulge , as a result of the merging process .",
    "the observed relative element abundances also support enrichment .",
    "we calculated the expected relative abundances due to enrichment by type ii and type ia sne , ignoring enrichment via stellar wind processes .",
    "we used the abundances relative to solar as found in tsujimoto et al .",
    "( 1995 ; their figures 12 ) , assuming a salpeter imf , converting to the abundances of lodders ( 2003 ) , and assuming one type ia explosion for every 10 type ii explosions . for the ratios listed in table 5 , we expect @xmath132 @xmath62.5 , @xmath133 through @xmath134 to be 1.41.7 , and @xmath135 through @xmath136 and @xmath137 to all be @xmath6 0.70.9 .",
    "most of our observed abundance ratios are consistent ( or at least roughly consistent ) with these predictions .",
    "the current burst of star formation is estimated to have started at least 50 myr ago ( e.g. , dufour et al .  1979 ) .",
    "assuming star formation at a uniform rate of 30 @xmath12 yr@xmath8 ( telesco 1978 measured a star formation rate 10 times that of the milky way s spiral arms ) , this is sufficient to enrich the gas to the current metallicity levels within that time span ( m.  loewenstein , priv .  comm . ) , although we can not know for certain how much enrichment of the gas has occurred within the last 10@xmath11 yr and how much occurred closer in time to the merger .    finally , we discuss the argument of hardcastle , evans and croston ( 2007 ) that `` high - excitation '' sources , which have torus - like circumnuclear absorbing gas and which accrete at moderate fractions of the eddington limit ( e.g. , fr iis ) , are fueled by a supply of cold gas , i.e. , gas transported to the nucleus as a result of a merger or tidal interactions .",
    "in contrast , `` low - excitation '' sources , which include all fr i s and some of the less powerful fr iis , may be powered by accretion of hot ( x - ray emitting ) gas .",
    "as mentioned before , cen a , although classified as an fr i , has heavy x - ray absorption characteristic of most fr iis .",
    "our observation of high metallicity , indicative of cold gas being transported inwards to the nucleus as a result of the merger , is thus consistent with this argument of `` cold - mode '' accretion .",
    "the combination of _ suzaku _ s xis and hxd has allowed us to obtain a high - quality spectrum of the nucleus ( inner 2 kpc ) of cen a spanning 0.3250 kev .",
    "the long exposure time , narrow response of the xis , and low background make the xis spectrum one of the highest quality ccd spectra of cen a to date , particularly below 2 kev .",
    "the hxd pin above 12 kev is more sensitive than _ rxte _ hexte or _ integral _",
    "instruments , allowing us to accurately and directly measure the 1276 kev flux and spectral shape .",
    "the hxd gso provides a direct estimate of the 45250 kev flux of cen a.    our best - fit model includes several broadband components .",
    "the @xmath443 kev emission can be fit by two absorbed power laws .",
    "the primary ( brighter ) power law is absorbed by a column of about 1.5@xmath010@xmath1 @xmath19 .",
    "the secondary power law , with a brightness about 19@xmath13 of the primary , is absorbed by a much higher column , about 7@xmath010@xmath1 @xmath2 . in our best - fit model ,",
    "the photon indices were the same , and the best - fit value was 1.817@xmath138 . untying",
    "the photon indices did not result in a significant fit improvement .",
    "including data down to 0.3 kev , we find that two vapec components plus a third absorbed power - law component can fit the data .",
    "the soft x - rays reveal emission lines due to he- and h - like o , fe xvii , he- and h - like ne , and he - like mg .",
    "the strong fe l emission supports an origin in collisionally ionized , rather than photoionized , gas .",
    "two vapec components of temperatures @xmath59 = 0.2 and 0.6 kev can model the soft x - ray emission lines well .",
    "the _ suzaku _ data are consistent with scenarios previously forwarded to explain the nature of the various power - law components . as suggested by evans et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the primary , hard x - ray power law is likely associated with bondi accretion at the black hole .",
    "the secondary power law could represent x - ray emission associated with the pc - scale vlbi jet , although this is not certain .",
    "alternatively , a partial - covering model , as suggested by turner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , may apply : 84@xmath13 ( 16@xmath13 ) of the sky as seen from the x - ray source is obscured by a column 1.5 ( 7 ) @xmath010@xmath1 @xmath19 . in any event , it more likely that the material obscuring the hard x - rays is associated with the circumnuclear material than with the optical dust lane .",
    "the third , soft x - ray power - law component is consistent with absorption by the optical dust lane only .",
    "it likely represents a blend of diffuse emission and knot emission from the kpc - scale jet ( as well as possibly the pc - scale jet ) , plus emission from a population of xrbs and other x - ray point sources , plus a likely contribution from scattered nuclear emission , which is likely less than 1@xmath13 of the total hard x - ray power - law emission .",
    "the hard x - ray photon index , the 210 kev flux , the fe k@xmath3 line intensity and the column density of the material absorbing the primary power law are all consistent with recent observations over the last @xmath65 years , suggesting that no large variations in these parameters have occurred over the last few years . during the _ suzaku _ observation ,",
    "the hard x - ray flux was not strongly variable on short timescales , showing only a 10@xmath13 increase in flux throughout the observation .",
    "k - shell absorption edges due to fe , ca , and s are significantly detected .",
    "several fluorescent emission lines , likely originating in the absorbing material , are detected .",
    "in addition to fe k@xmath3 and fe k@xmath21 , k@xmath3 lines from si , s , ar , ca and ni are detected at at least 90@xmath13 confidence .",
    "the latter three are detected for the first time in cen a. the strict upper limit on the amount of compton reflection , @xmath139 , supports the notion that the fluorescent lines originate in compton - thin material .",
    "the fe k@xmath3 line width is @xmath17 2500 km s@xmath8 fwhm .",
    "if the line - emitting material is in virial orbit , then it is no closer than 200 light - days to the black hole .",
    "no emission due to he- or h - like fe is detected .",
    "the fe k edge energy is consistent with absorption by fe i ; ionization stages above fe @xmath6v are ruled out .",
    "the gas does not likely completely surround the x - ray continuum source ; the equivalent width of the fe k@xmath3 line is more consistent with gas which is clumpy and/or covers the continuum source only partially , or the bulk of the gas may lie off the line of sight to the x - ray source , possibly in the form of a disk .",
    "metallicities are measured for the circumnuclear absorbing gas for the first time in cen a. the high signal - to - noise ratio of the xis spectrum has enabled us to use the k - shell absorption edge depths , relative fluorescent line strengths , and thermal plasma emission lines to derive abundances ( we have assumed that abundances in the thermal plasma gas are the same as those for the circumnuclear absorbing material ) .",
    "we observe a value of [ m / h ] = log(@xmath43 ) = + 0.1 for the circumnuclear material / diffuse plasma which is much higher than for the halo stars at 2030 kpc radii .",
    "it is likely that the merger that created cen a s famous edge - on dust disk also triggered the infall of cold gas into the inner regions of cen a , where it currently accretes onto the black hole .",
    "our metallicity observation suggests that the accreting material could not have originated in the relatively metal - poor outer halo unless enrichment due to local star formation occurred at some point .",
    "the relative observed abundances are indeed consistent with enrichment by a mixture of type ii and type ia supernovae .",
    "this high signal - to - noise ratio ccd observation has yielded breakthroughs in constraining abundances , but further progress can be made with a very high spectral resolution instrument , such as the planned calorimeter aboard _ constellation - x_. by better constraining the widths and intensities of k@xmath3 emission lines and soft x - ray emission lines , as well as edge energies and depths , _ constellation - x _ will thus yield abundance constraints on the circumnuclear material in potentially many dozens of agns once it is launched .",
