    "with respect to the _ uniform distribution _ on @xmath0 , the problem was solved independently by vershik @xcite , brny @xcite and sinai @xcite , who showed that , under the scaling @xmath38 , the limit shape @xmath29 is given by a parabola arc defined by the cartesian equation @xmath39 more precisely ( cf .",

    "this observation incorporates the topic of convex lattice polygonal lines in a general theory of integer partitions . for ordinary , one - dimensional partitions ,",
    "the problem of limit shape can also be set up , but for a special geometric object associated with partitions , called _ young diagrams _",

    "was only sketched , so even in the uniform case our proof seems to be the first complete implementation of sinai s probabilistic method ( which , as we will try to explain below , is far from straightforward ) .",
    "let us also point out that theorem [ th : main1 ] is a _ non - trivial _ extension of ( [ eq : vbs ] ) since the measures @xmath10 ( @xmath70 ) are _ not close _ to the uniform distribution @xmath71 in total variation distance ( denoted by @xmath72 ) , and in fact @xmath73 as @xmath5 ( see theorem [ th : lim(r ) ] in the appendix ) .",

    "theorem [ th : main2 ] shows that the limit shape result holds true ( with the same limit @xmath29 ) when the parameter @xmath78 specifying the distribution @xmath45 is chosen at random . using the terminology designed for settings with random environments , theorems [ th : main1 ] and [ th : main2 ]",
    "may be interpreted as `` quenched '' and `` annealed '' statements , respectively .",
    "the universality of the limit shape @xmath29 , established in theorem [ th : main1 ] , is not a general rule but rather an exception , holding for some , but not all , probability measures on the polygonal space @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , as was shown by bogachev and zarbaliev @xcite , _ any _ @xmath79-smooth , strictly convex curve @xmath80 started at the origin may appear as the limit shape with respect to _ some _ probability measure @xmath81 on @xmath0 , as @xmath5 .",
    "the main results of the present paper have been recently reported ( without proofs ) in a brief note @xcite .",
    "our proof of theorem [ th : main1 ] employs an elegant probabilistic approach first applied to convex lattice polygonal lines by sinai @xcite .",
    "this method is based on randomization of the ( fixed ) right endpoint @xmath82 of polygonal lines @xmath6 , leading to the interpretation of a given ( e.g. , uniform ) measure @xmath28 on @xmath0 as the conditional distribution induced by a suitable probability measure @xmath83 ( depending on an auxiliary `` free '' parameter @xmath16 ) defined on the `` global '' space @xmath15 of _ all _ convex lattice polygonal lines ( with finitely many edges ) . to make the measure @xmath83 closer to @xmath28 on the subspace @xmath84 specified by the condition @xmath82 , it is natural to pick the parameter @xmath85 from the asymptotic equation @xmath86 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "then , in principle , asymptotic properties of polygonal lines @xmath1 ( e.g. , the limit shape ) can be established first for @xmath87 and then transferred to @xmath88 via conditioning with respect to @xmath0 and using an appropriate local limit theorem for the probability @xmath89 .",
    "a great advantage of working with the measure @xmath83 is that it may be chosen as a `` multiplicative statistic '' @xcite ( i.e. , a direct product of one - dimensional probability measures ) , thus corresponding to the distribution of a sequence of independent random variables , which immediately brings in insights and well - developed analytical tools of probability theory .    sinai s approach in @xcite was motivated by a heuristic analogy with statistical mechanics , where similar ideas are well known in the context of asymptotic equivalence , in the thermodynamic limit , of various statistical ensembles ( i.e. , _ microcanonical _ , _ canonical _ , and _ grand canonical _ ) that may be associated with a given physical system ( e.g. , gas ) by optional fixing of the total energy and/or the number of particles ( see ruelle @xcite ) . in particular , khinchin @xcite has pioneered a systematic use of local limit theorems of probability theory in problems of statistical mechanics .",
    "deep connections between statistical properties of quantum systems ( where discrete random structures naturally arise due to quantization ) and asymptotic theory of random integer partitions are discussed in a series of papers by vershik @xcite ( see also the recent work by comtet et al .",
    "@xcite and further references therein ) .",
    "note also that a general idea of randomization has proved instrumental in a large variety of combinatorial problems ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the vast bibliography therein ) .",
    "the probabilistic method is very insightful and efficient , as it makes the arguments heuristically transparent and natural .",
    "however , the practical implementation of this approach requires substantial work , especially in the two - dimensional context of convex lattice polygonal lines as compared to the one - dimensional case exemplified by integer partitions and the corresponding young diagrams @xcite .",
    "to begin with , evaluation of expected values and some higher - order statistical moments of random polygonal lines leads one to deal with various sums over the set @xmath90 of points @xmath91 with co - prime coordinates ( see section  [ sec2.1 ] ) .",
    "sinai @xcite was able to obtain the limit of some basic sums of such a kind by appealing to the known asymptotic density of the set @xmath90 in @xmath92 ( given by @xmath93 ) ; however , this argumentation is insufficient for more refined asymptotics . in the present paper ,",
    "we handle this technical problem by using the mbius inversion formula ( see section  [ sec3 ] ) , which enables one to reduce sums over @xmath90 to more regular sums .",
    "as already mentioned , another crucial ingredient required for the probabilistic method is a suitable local limit theorem that furnishes a `` bridge '' between the global distribution @xmath83 and the conditional one , @xmath28 .",
    "analytical difficulties encountered in the proof of such a result are already significant in the case of ordinary integer partitions ( for more details and concrete examples , see @xcite and further references therein ) .",
    "the case of convex lattice polygonal lines , corresponding to two - dimensional strict vector partitions ( see remark  [ rm : strict ] ) , is notoriously tedious , even though the standard method of characteristic functions is still applicable . to the best of our knowledge , after the original paper by sinai @xcite where the result was just stated ( with a minor error in the determinant of the covariance matrix @xcite ) , full details have not been worked out in the literature ( however , see @xcite ) .",
    "we prove the following result in this direction ( cf.theorem  [ th : lclt ] ) .",
    "[ th : intro - lclt ] suppose that the parameter @xmath85 is chosen so that @xmath94 . then as @xmath5 @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the covariance matrix of the random vector @xmath97 with respect to the probability measure @xmath98 .",
    "the quantities @xmath99 and @xmath100 , obtained via the measure @xmath14 , depend in general on the parameter @xmath78 as well .",
    "for the sake of notational convenience the latter is omitted , which should cause no confusion since @xmath78 is always fixed , unless stated explicitly otherwise .",
    "one can show that the covariance matrix @xmath100 is of the order of @xmath101 , and in particular @xmath102 and @xmath103 . from the right - hand side of ( [ eq : intro - lclt ] ) , it is then clear that one needs to refine the error term in the asymptotic relation @xmath104 by estimating the deviation @xmath105 to at least the order of @xmath106 .",
    "we have been able to obtain the following estimate ( cf.theorem  [ th:5.1 ] ) .",
    "[ th : intro - a ] under the conditions of theorem @xmath107    the proof of this result is quite involved .",
    "the main idea is to apply the mellin transform and use the inversion formula to obtain a suitable integral representation for the difference @xmath108 of the form ( @xmath109 ) @xmath110 where @xmath111 happens to be of the order of @xmath112 ( according to the `` optimal '' choice of @xmath85 as explained at the beginning of section  [ sec1.3 ] ; cf .",
    "theorem [ th : delta12 ] ) , @xmath113 is an explicit function analytic in the strip @xmath114 , and @xmath115 is the riemann zeta function . as usual , to obtain a better estimate of the integral one has to shift the integration contour in ( [ eq : intro - m ] ) as far to the left as possible , and it turns out that to get an estimate of order @xmath116 one needs to enter the critical strip @xmath117 , which requires information about zeroes of the zeta function in view of the denominator @xmath115 in ( [ eq : intro - m ] ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ] , we explain the basics of the probability method in the polygonal context and define the parametric families of measures @xmath14 and @xmath65 ( @xmath46 ) . in section  [ sec3 ] , we choose suitable values of the parameter @xmath16 ( theorem  [ th : delta12 ] ) , which implies convergence of `` expected '' polygonal lines to the limit curve @xmath29 ( section  [ sec4 ] , theorems [ th:3.2 ] and  [ th:8.1.1a ] ) . the refined error estimate ( [ eq : intro - a ] ) is proved in section  [ sec5 ] ( theorem  [ th:5.1 ] ) .",
    "higher - order moment sums are analyzed in section  [ sec6 ] ; in particular , the asymptotics of the covariance matrix @xmath100 is obtained in theorem  [ th : k ] .",
    "section  [ sec7 ] is devoted to the proof of the local central limit theorem ( theorem  [ th : lclt ] ) .",
    "finally , the limit shape result , with respect to both @xmath14 and @xmath65 , is proved in section  [ sec8 ] ( theorems [ th:8.2 ] and  [ th:8.2a ] ) .",
    "the appendix includes necessary details about the tangential parameterization and the tangential metric @xmath69 on the space of convex paths ( section  [ a-1 ] ) , as well as a discussion of the total variation distance between the measures @xmath65 ( @xmath70 ) and the uniform distribution @xmath71 ( section  [ a-2 ] , theorems [ th : vasser ] and  [ th : lim(r ) ] ) .",
    "let us fix some general notations frequently used in the paper . for a row - vector @xmath118 , its euclidean norm ( length )",
