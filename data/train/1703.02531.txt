    "<S> the  mott - kitaev \" iridates crystallize in 2d and 3d structures ( the harmonic honeycombs  @xcite ) , and all known compounds are found to magnetically order at low temperature in one of two ways : a commensurate ` zig - zag ' phase ( found in and @xmath1-rucl@xmath2  @xcite ) , and an incommensurate order ( found in @xmath1 , @xmath3 and  @xcite ) . </S>",

    "<S> we assign @xmath35 as the parameter describing this field induced broken symmetry , which _ ex concessis _ is proportional to the scattering form factor , leading to a quadratic field dependence in the intensity @xmath36 . </S>",

    "<S> considering we are measuring both the @xmath43 and @xmath44 channels , and see no intensity for all @xmath45 peaks at @xmath46{t}$ ] , we can rule out a zero - field phase with continuous canting of the moments by the field . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that our observations are most likely explained by an increasing moment size , with long - range quantum correlations turning on @xmath34{k}$ ] , which can not develop a sizable ordered moment at zero field , presumably due to the system s intrinsic magnetic frustration .    </S>",
    "<S> this behavior differs from archetypical examples of phase transitions in magnetic field such as spin - flops or incommensurate to commensurate transitions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these are usually first order transitions ; the former is a transition between an antiferromagnetic state and a spin - polarized state , while the latter will often cause the incommensurate order to soften , shifting toward a commensurate @xmath25 as it is suppressed by the field . in the present case , </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : rmxs_hf]g we show each of the symmetry distinct @xmath52 broken symmetry states , denoted using the conventional nomenclature . </S>",
    "<S> the states that are consistent with the primary features of the data are two - fold : ( i ) @xmath53-type ( zig - zag ) broken symmetry ( explaining the appearance of the @xmath54 peaks ) and ( ii ) @xmath55-type order ( explaining the linear dependence of the the allowed structural peaks ) . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , these represent symmetries that are broken by the applied magnetic field itself . </S>",
    "<S> first , an induced moment along the applied magnetic field on each ion would transform as an @xmath55-like object with moments along @xmath6 ( denoted @xmath56 ) . </S>",
    "<S> second , the effective local susceptibility tensor ( including orbital @xmath57-factor as well as correlation effects ) is anisotropic ( see reference   for a discussion of ) and it can be decomposed into components parallel and perpendicular to the two honeycomb chain directions , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the moments will in general ca nt equally and oppositely along the @xmath4 directions , leading to @xmath53-like broken symmetry , with moments staggered along @xmath47 ( denoted @xmath58 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown ( see supplementary information ) that @xmath56 and @xmath58 not only belong to the same irreducible representation as @xmath10 , allowing @xmath35 to coexist on symmetry grounds , but are in fact energetically favored over other broken symmetry states . </S>",
    "<S> our observations are completely consistent with landau theory of second order phase transitions - the combined effect of magnetic field and crystal symmetry is to act as a ` field ' for the commensurate order , so that the observed zig - zag pattern is linearly coupled to magnetic field ( leading to an intensity @xmath59 that is quadratic , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rmxs_hf]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this also explains why there is no thermodynamic anomaly on cooling at @xmath26 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : susc]c ) : the symmetry breaking associated with @xmath35 is already broken by the applied @xmath60 .    </S>",
    "<S> however , a simple linear response to the applied field does not explain the temperature dependence of @xmath35 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rmxs_hf]e ) , which evolves like a thermodynamic order parameter . nor </S>",
    "<S> does it explain the observation that the moment lost from @xmath10 appears to be entirely transferred to @xmath35 , which is strongly suggested by a simple sum rule of their respective intensities ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phasedi]a ) . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> if we assume that the ordered moment of @xmath35 is canted entirely along the diagonal bond axes @xmath4 ( which would be equivalent to the ` zig - zag ' order seen in and rucl@xmath2 , we find a quantitative equivalence between the ordered moment of @xmath35 and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> noting at the kink field the magnetic moment is @xmath61{\\nicefrac{\\upmu_{\\textrm{b}}}{ir}}$ ] , this suggests that the moment along the chains is @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is around half the angle between the diagonal chains . </S>",

    "<S> nevertheless , the heat capacity ( fig .  [ fig : susc]b ) shows no singular anomaly expected of a thermodynamic phase transition for @xmath66{t}$ ] , but instead shows a broad break in slope as the temperature is lowered . </S>",
    "<S> this break in slope is much clearer in the field - dependent heat capacity at constant temperature ( see supplementary information ) , where it appears as a broad crossover between the low field and high field regimes . </S>",
    "<S> plotting the location of this peak on a phase diagram , we observe immediately that it maps directly onto a constant contour line of the i@xmath67 amplitude , the experimental measure of @xmath35 itself . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the applied magnetic field , induces a thermodynamically stable ` zig - zag ' ordered phase , but without a spontaneous symmetry - breaking phase transition or its associated singularities .    in @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> type structures , the low temperature ground state is found to be incommensurate  @xcite in the li - based compounds but zig - zag in the na - based compounds . </S>",
    "<S> the former has been linked to strong kitaev exchange in several independent theoretical works @xcite , whereas the latter does not directly need kitaev exchange at all  @xcite , leaving the question open as to whether a single hamiltonian captures the relevant physics for all of these compounds . </S>",
    "<S> our results hint that there exists a universal theoretical framework with which to understand the magnetism of the ` harmonic ' honeycomb iridates , with kitaev exchange as the dominant energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , given a simple model of kitaev and heisenberg exchange terms in the effective hamiltonian , it can be shown that the transition to @xmath35 at @xmath18 directly implies that the kitaev term dominates ( see supplementary information sec.[sec : khest ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , this work exposes the presence of a quantum critical point at @xmath18 in a kitaev exchange - dominant system  @xcite , providing a unique opportunity to study the physics of kitaev interactions in a purely quantum ( @xmath68{k}$ ] ) regime  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> our observations are completely consistent with the landau theory of second order phase transitions . on the other hand , while a ferromagnet has a finite order parameter at zero field , in the present case @xmath35 only exists if a field is present . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> the applied magnetic field is acting on a _ vestigial _ order , taking moment away from the true ground state @xmath10 and transferring it to another @xmath35 , without ever causing a thermodynamic phase transition . </S>",

    "<S> in addition to placing severe constraints on the microscopic hamiltonian describing these systems , these results experimentally demonstrate that there is a unified description of the mott - kitaev honeycomb family  @xcite , and more broadly , that these materials are playgrounds for the study of exotic phases in highly frustrated quantum magnets . </S>"
