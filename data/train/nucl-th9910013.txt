    "covariant field theory can be coerced into giving solutions to non - perturbative problems such as bound states via the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "there are technical difficulties in arriving at those solutions , but they are manifestly covariant .",
    "an alternative approach that also provides covariant results is obtained by using a hamiltonian theory and the corresponding schrdinger equation to solve for the bound states .",
    "a consequence of this covariance is that the commutation relations between the operators that constitute the four - momentum ( @xmath0 ) and the four - angular momentum ( @xmath1 ) give a representation of the poincar algebra .",
    "there are many different formulations of hamiltonian theories , corresponding to different forms of dynamics , as discussed by dirac @xcite .",
    "the components of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 operators can be classified as either dynamic ( dependent on the interaction ) or kinematic .",
    "different forms of dynamics result in different separations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 into dynamic operators and kinematic operators .",
    "the two forms that we will be concerned with are the equal - time and light - front formalisms .",
    "the equal - time form gives four dynamical operators , while the light - front form yields only three dynamical ones .",
    "having a small number of dynamical operators is good since this simplifies some calculations .    using the canonical coordinate system , with @xmath2 and defining the commutation relations at equal time ( @xmath3 ) , we obtain the most familiar hamiltonian theory , an equal - time theory . for this system , rotations and translations",
    "are kinematical , while the hamiltonian and generators of boosts are dynamical .",
    "the fact that the generators of boosts are dynamical implies that when the full hamiltonian is truncated , it will no longer transform appropriately under boosts .",
    "this implies that the equal - time hamiltonian may not be well - suited for relativistic problems .",
    "an alternative coordinate system is obtained by using light - front variables @xmath4 to construct @xmath5 .",
    "high - energy experiments are naturally described using these coordinates , rather than equal - time ones .",
    "this is because the front of a beam traveling at the speed of light in the ( negative ) three - direction is defined by a surface where @xmath6 is constant .",
    "the description of the interaction of this beam with a target is much simpler if described in terms of light - front variables @xcite than if an equal - time variables are used . as an example , the bjorken @xmath7",
    "variable used to describe deep inelastic scattering experiments is simply the ratio of the plus momentum of the struck constituent particle to the total plus momentum of the bound state .    using the light - front coordinate system and defining the commutation relations at equal light - front time ( @xmath8 )",
    ", we obtain a light - front hamiltonian theory @xcite . for this choice , rotation about the three axis , translations in the one , two , and plus directions , and the generators of boosts in the one , two , and plus directions are kinematical , while the hamiltonian @xmath9 and rotations about the one and two directions are dynamical .",
    "since the boosts are kinematical , the light - front hamiltonian is useful for relativistic problems , such as strongly - bound systems , even when the hamiltonian is truncated .",
    "however , since two of the rotations are dynamical , the momentum operator four - vector will not be covariant under those rotations when the hamiltonian is truncated .",
    "this lack of manifest rotational invariance presents some difficulties for bound - state calculations .",
    "a key benefit of using the light front is that the vacuum can be very simple .",
    "for our theory , the masses of the particles are large .",
    "all massive particles and anti - particles have positive plus momentum , and the total plus momentum is a conserved quantity .",
    "thus , there is no condensation , and the vacuum ( with @xmath10 ) is empty , the fock space vacuum .",
    "thus , the hilbert space for this theory is the fock space .",
    "diagrams that couple to the vacuum vanish , so the number of non - trivial light - front time - ordered diagrams is greatly reduced compared to the equal - time theory .      an untruncated light - front hamiltonian will commute with the total relative angular momentum operator , since the total momentum commutes with the relative momentum . thus , for the scalar theory we consider here , the eigenstates of the full hamiltonian will also be eigenstates of the angular momentum . however , as mentioned earlier , a fock - space truncation of the light - front hamiltonian results in the momentum operator four - vector losing covariance under rotations .",
    "hence @xmath11 and the truncated hamiltonian do not commute and this implies that the eigenstates of the truncated hamiltonian will not be eigenstates of the angular momentum",
    ".    how will this violation of rotational invariance affect physical observables ?",
    "a way to observe this violation is to note that on the light front , rotational invariance about the three - axis is maintained .",
    "this allows us to classify states as eigenstates of @xmath12 with eigenvalues @xmath13 .",
    "we compare the energies of states with the same `` relative angular momentum '' quantum number @xmath14 but different @xmath13 values .",
    "we will define the `` relative angular momentum '' operator in section [ uxsec ] .",
    "if the hamiltonian were rotationally invariant , the energies should be the same ; the breaking of rotational invariance causes the energies to be different @xcite .",
    "we expect that the higher fock - space components of the full hamiltonian will be small if the coupling constant is small enough .",
    "thus , truncation at successively higher orders should reduce the violation of rotational invariance of the truncated hamiltonian .",
    "in particular , by retaining enough terms in the perturbation expansion of the hamiltonian , the violation of rotational invariance can be reduced to an arbitrarily small amount , provided only that a perturbation expansion is valid .",
    "thus , the only real question is : how many terms are required ?",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore how truncation at different orders in the effective potential affects the breaking of rotational invariance of the spectra .",
    "the model we are using is a lagrangian with neutral scalar particles coupled via a @xmath15 interaction to other neutral scalar particles .",
    "the bethe - salpeter equation for this lagrangian is discussed , and the ladder approximation to the bethe - salpeter equation and its spectra are reviewed .",
    "we also derive the light - front hamiltonian from that lagrangian and write out the light - front schrdinger equation for bound states consisting of two particles . an approximation to the light - front potential that causes the light - front schrdinger equation to be equivalent to the ladder bethe - salpeter equation",
    "is discussed .",
    "this approximation will be called the _",
    "uncrossed approximation_. the one - boson - exchange ( obe ) effective potential and two - boson - exchange ( tbe ) effective potential are derived in this approximation .",
    "all of this is discussed in more detail in section [ ourmodel ] .    following the development of the model , we look at some numerical calculations in section [ results ] . for our tests ,",
    "we look at states composed of two massive scalar particles bound by the effects of the exchange of a lighter scalar particle .",
    "we calculate the spectra ( the coupling constant versus bound - state mass curves ) using the bethe - salpeter equation in the ladder approximation .",
    "since the bethe - salpeter equation is manifestly covariant , its solutions are states with definite angular momentum .",
    "we also calculate the spectra using a light - front schrdinger equation with the obe and the obe+tbe potentials . because of the lack of manifest rotational invariance",
    ", these wavefunctions do not have definite angular momentum .",
    "an artificial `` relative angular momentum '' operator is constructed , and a partial - wave decomposition is performed on these wavefunctions to analyze the various angular momentum states present in them .",
    "the problem of trying to classify these states is discussed .",
    "we then plot the spectra for the wavefunctions classified as the lowest - lying @xmath16- and @xmath17-wave states for the bethe - salpeter , obe schrdinger , and the obe+tbe schrdinger equations .    in section [ conclusions ] , we summarize our findings : the higher - order terms help to partially restore the breaking of rotational invariance introduced by using only the obe potential .",
    "this restoration is largest when the states are weakly bound .",
    "we stress that the point of this paper is _ not _ to solve the lagrangian of this model exactly .",
    "instead , we seek to understand how rotational invariance is broken by the light - front hamiltonian in the uncrossed approximation , how it can be partially restored by keeping higher - order graphs , and also to compare the results from the two truncated hamiltonians to the results of the `` exact '' theory ( the ladder bethe - salpeter equation ) .",
    "discussion of the inclusion of the crossed - graph contributions will be given in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "this study is closely connected to the work of schoonderwoerd , bakker , and karmanov @xcite , who considered two - body scattering in perturbation theory using a model similar to ours .",
    "off - shell scattering amplitudes were computed at order @xmath18 and it was found that for low momenta , the tbe diagrams contributed much less than the iterated obe diagrams .",
    "this lead to a conjecture that the lightly - bound states should be well described by the obe potential , with the tbe potential playing a minor role .",
    "these results encourage us to calculate and compare bound states incorporating the obe and obe+tbe diagrams .",
    "we note that some of the difficulties present in @xcite are avoided here since there are no singularities in the bound - state integral equation .    while this manuscript was in preparation , a paper by sales _ et .",
    "@xcite appeared . in that work ,",
    "a model similar to ours was used to consider bound states .",
    "their study included the same two truncations that we use , as well as the a comparison to the bethe - salpeter equation results",
    ". however , the investigation of ref .  @xcite focused on the ground state , while here we are concerned with the rotational invariance of the excited states .",
    "we consider two distinguishable uncharged scalars @xmath19 with mass @xmath20 ( which we will refer to as _ nucleons _ ) , that couple to a third , uncharged scalar @xmath21 with mass @xmath22 ( which we will refer to as a _ meson _ ) by a @xmath15 interaction .",
    "this @xmath15 theory , which can be considered a massive extension of the wick - cutkosky model @xcite , has been used by schoonderwoerd , bakker , and karmanov @xcite on the light front to study scattering states .",

    "thus , in that limit , all states with the same principal quantum number have the same energy . when @xmath148 , that degeneracy is broken , but only slightly , as we can see from fig .",
    "[ bsfig ] .",
    "because of this , we will label our states using atomic spectroscopy notation .",
    "next , we consider the two light - front schrdinger equations given by eqs .",
    "( [ obeham ] ) and ( [ tbeham ] ) .",
    "these equations are solved numerically ( for each parity and several @xmath13 values ) for the spectrum @xmath41 for a range of bound - state energies @xmath37 .",
    "the symmetries of the light - front hamiltonian allow us to classify the states according to @xmath13 and the action under parity , so as an example , we calculate the spectra with even parity and @xmath149 . for the range of values we use ,",
    "we find the numerical errors in @xmath132 are less than 2% .",
    "the errors are largest for the most deeply bound states with the largest coupling constants , as was the case for the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "we plot both the obe spectra [ in fig .",
    "[ plotraw](a ) ] and the obe+tbe spectra [ in fig .",
    "[ plotraw](b ) ] along with the bethe - salpeter spectra for the even parity and @xmath149 states . based on the energies",
    ", we see that the @xmath150 state is expected to be the @xmath151 state , the @xmath152 state the @xmath153 state , and the @xmath154 and @xmath155 states the @xmath156 or @xmath157 states .",
    "we see approximate agreement between both of the truncated hamiltonian results and the bethe - salpeter results for lightly - bound systems ( where @xmath158 ) .",
    "our states are not manifest eigenstates of total angular momentum @xmath11 . however ,",
    "if our approximation of the hamiltonian potential was good enough , we would be able to identify the @xmath154 and @xmath155 states of the light - front hamiltonian calculation with @xmath156 and @xmath157 states of the bethe - salpeter equation unambiguously .",
    "this would determine the angular momentum of the light - front schrdinger equation wavefunctions . from fig .",
    "[ plotraw ] , we see both that the addition of the tbe potential brings the @xmath154 and @xmath155 states closer to the bethe - salpeter results , and that in the lightly - bound region the @xmath154 and @xmath155 states can be identified as @xmath156 and @xmath157 states . for more deeply - bound states , this identification can not be made .",
    "an alternative approach to assigning angular momenta labels would be perform a partial - wave decomposition of the wavefunctions in the real angular momentum basis .",
    "the wavefunctions could then be labeled by the angular momentum component which is dominant . in light - front dynamics , this is difficult to do since the perpendicular components of the real angular momentum operator ( @xmath159 and @xmath160 ) are dynamical , which makes the angular momentum operator as complicated as the hamiltonian . we are encouraged to look for an alternative operator which is easier to use , yet approximates the behavior of the real angular momentum .",
    "we shall use the `` relative angular momentum '' , defined by @xmath128 , where the vectors are equal - time three - vectors .",
    "the relative momentum @xmath127 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ eteq ] ) and @xmath161 is canonically conjugate to @xmath127 . the `` relative angular momentum '' @xmath162 is used to help analyze our solutions , and is not the same as the real angular momentum that can be derived from the lagrangian using the energy - momentum tensor . however , we will see that the `` relative angular momentum '' gives results that are expected from the real angular momentum , so our use of the `` relative angular momentum '' in place of the real one appears to be justified .",
    "a partial - wave decomposition is performed on the wavefunctions ( represented in the relative momentum basis ) to obtain the radial wavefunctions @xmath163 for all `` relative angular momentum '' states @xmath164 . since the potential is not manifestly rotationally invariant when written in terms of the relative momentum , our wavefunctions will have support from many different partial waves .",
    "not all partial waves are allowed ; only those partial - wave states with the same @xmath12 and parity quantum numbers as the wavefunction give non - vanishing radial wavefunctions .",
    "we have @xmath165 we define the fraction of the wavefunction with `` relative angular momentum '' @xmath14 as @xmath166 the fractions @xmath167 are a measure of the amount of `` relative angular momentum '' state @xmath14 in the @xmath39 eigenfunction .    to illustrate these `` relative angular momentum '' fractions",
    ", we perform this analysis on the four lowest coupling constant wavefunctions with even parity and @xmath149 for both the obe and obe+tbe truncations , the same as in fig .",
    "[ plotraw ] .",
    "we show @xmath167 as a function of @xmath37 in fig .",
    "[ fracfig ] .",
    "( the plots for the @xmath168 states show similar behavior , with different @xmath14 values . )",
    "note that more higher `` relative angular momentum '' states contribute for deeper bound states .",
    "this is the same behavior that would be expected if the real angular momentum was used to perform the partial wave decomposition .",
    "recall that the real angular momentum will commute with the full potential if no truncation is made .",
    "however , the potentials we use are truncated , and neglecting the higher - order terms breaks the rotational invariance of the potential .",
    "also , both the binding and the importance of the higher - order diagrams increase with the coupling constant .",
    "thus , both truncations we consider will break rotational invariance more when the states are more deeply bound . in the absence of having the real angular momentum fractions",
    ", we will use the `` relative angular momentum '' fractions .",
    "examination of the @xmath167 curves in fig .",
    "[ fracfig ] shows us that , as postulated earlier , the @xmath150 and @xmath152 states shown in figs .   [ fracfig](a , e ) and [ fracfig](b , f ) are predominately @xmath169-wave states , which we label the @xmath151 and @xmath153 states respectively . for the obe truncation , the @xmath154 state shown in fig .",
    "[ fracfig](c ) is predominately @xmath17-wave ( labeled the @xmath157 state ) and the @xmath155 state shown in fig .",
    "[ fracfig](d ) is predominately @xmath169-wave ( labeled the @xmath156 state ) , with little mixing between the two states .",
    "for the obe+tbe truncation , the @xmath154 and @xmath155 states are mixtures of both the @xmath156 and @xmath157 states , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fracfig](g , h ) in fact , we see a level crossing between the @xmath170 states in that the @xmath154 state is predominantly @xmath157 for lightly - bound systems , but as the binding increases , the @xmath154 state becomes predominantly @xmath156 .",
    "again , this type of mixing would also be found if the real angular momentum was used .",
    "if this @xmath156-@xmath157 mixing is ignored , then fig .",
    "[ fracfig ] shows clearly that when the tbe is included the amount of `` relative angular momentum '' states mixed in actually _",
    "decreases _ as compared to the obe results .",
    "this implies that the wavefunctions of the obe+tbe equation are better `` relative angular momentum '' states than the wavefunctions of the obe equation .",
    "thus the tbe potential restores some rotational invariance to the obe calculation .",
    "we attempt to classify the wavefunctions as states with definite angular momentum .",
    "if a wavefunction has the most support from the `` relative angular momentum '' state @xmath14 , we classify that state as having angular momentum @xmath14 .",
    "this procedure designates the first two wavefunctions for both the obe and the obe+tbe cases as @xmath169-wave states , which is clearly the right thing to do . for the third and fourth wavefunctions of the obe+tbe equation",
    ", there are points where the fraction of the @xmath169-wave state equals the fraction of the @xmath17-wave state . here",
    "it no longer clear that such a state should be assigned a definite `` relative angular momentum '' value ; we do so regardless and analyze the consequences later .",
    "we now examine the breaking of rotational invariance of the two truncations based on the comparison of states with different @xmath13 projections of the same angular momentum .",
    "since the @xmath169-wave state has only @xmath149 , there is nothing to analyse in that case .",
    "further discussion of the ground - state @xmath169-wave will appear in ref .",
    "@xcite . in figs .",
    "[ 2pfig ] , [ 3pfig ] , and [ 3dfig ] , we plot the bethe - salpeter bound - state spectra along with the spectra for the states constructed with the obe and the obe+tbe potentials .",
    "the different @xmath13 states for the bethe - salpeter equation are exactly degenerate as a result of the rotational invariance of the equation .",
    "the curves from the hamiltonian theory do not exhibit the exact degeneracy in @xmath13 ; the degeneracy is broken whether the obe or obe+tbe potentials are used .",
    "however , we see that the degeneracy is partially restored when the tbe potential is included , in that for a given binding energy the spread of the coupling constants is always smaller .    in figs .",
    "[ 2pfig ] and [ 3pfig ] , we plot the spectra for the @xmath171 and @xmath172 states , respectively . in both figures",
    ", we see that the @xmath149 and @xmath173 curves move closer together after addition of the tbe potential .",
    "however , the average of the two curves for each case does not move much .",
    "in fact , for the @xmath172 state in fig .",
    "[ 3pfig ] , the @xmath173 curve moves farther away from the ladder bethe - salpeter curve after addition of the tbe .",
    "we also note that in fig .",
    "[ 3pfig ] the spread of the spectra is larger than in fig .",
    "[ 2pfig ] for both the obe and the obe+tbe light - front schrdinger equations .",
    "we attribute this to the neglect of the higher - order graphs .",
    "since the states with different @xmath13 values would be degenerate if all the higher - order graphs were included , not including them causes a breaking of the degeneracy .",
    "because the coupling constant is larger for the @xmath172 states than for the @xmath171 states with the same binding energy , the omission of the higher - order graphs causes a larger breaking of the degeneracy for the @xmath172 states .",
    "we also consider the first @xmath17-wave states .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ 3dfig ] that , as in figs .",
    "[ 2pfig ] and [ 3pfig ] , the states with different @xmath13 values move together after addition of tbe .",
    "the effect of the level crossing of the @xmath156 and @xmath157 states shown in figs .",
    "[ fracfig](g ) and [ fracfig](h ) is seen here in that there are two disjoint curves for @xmath149 .",
    "when the level crossing occurs , at @xmath174 , the wavefunction which originally was the @xmath156 state becomes the @xmath157 state and vice versa .",
    "there are some problems that this level crossing causes . in the intermediate region where the @xmath156 and @xmath157 states are about equally mixed",
    ", it is probably not physically sensible to call the state a @xmath156 or @xmath157 state .",
    "however , plotting the curves gives us an indication of what the wavefunctions are doing , and for this case we see that the @xmath149 curve is always bounded by the @xmath173 and @xmath175 curves .",
    "a more restrictive classification scheme would leave a gap ( in @xmath176 ) between the two @xmath149 curves and it would not be so clear that the bounding of the @xmath149 curve which we observe here occurs .    finally , we note that the spread of the curves in the @xmath157 case is approximately the same as the spread in the @xmath172 case for each truncation .",
    "this tells us that the higher - order graphs have the same qualitative effect in both states .",
    "in this paper , we considered two truncations of the light - front hamiltonian , the obe and obe+tbe truncations . using these truncations ,",
    "a `` relative angular momentum '' operator was used to study the partial - wave decompositions of the bound - state wavefunctions .",
    "we found that the `` relative angular momentum '' operator acting on those states yield behavior similar to that expected from the real angular momentum .",
    "this result encourages the use of this operator to classify the states according to their angular momentum values @xmath14 , and to study the degeneracy of the spectra for states with the same @xmath14 value but with different projections @xmath13 .",
    "we found less breaking of the degeneracy when the obe+tbe potential was used than when the obe potential was used . both of these findings indicate that the obe+tbe truncation of the hamiltonian breaks rotational invariance less than the obe truncation alone .",
    "however , there is still some discrepancy between our truncated hamiltonian spectra and the ladder bethe - salpeter spectra . in general , our obe+tbe results for the @xmath16- and @xmath17-wave states show deeper binding than the bethe - salpeter results .",
    "not surprisingly , this disagreement is largest for the most deeply bound - states where the coupling is largest .",
    "this difference would be removed if all the higher - order pieces of the potential were included .",
    "these higher - order pieces are also needed for the full restoration of rotational invariance .",
