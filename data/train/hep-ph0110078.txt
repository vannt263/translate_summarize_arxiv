    "however , it has recently been shown that in the heavy - quark limit the decay amplitudes for these processes can be calculated in a model - independent way using a qcd factorization approach @xcite , which is similar to the scheme developed earlier for non - leptonic two - body decays of @xmath7 mesons @xcite .    to leading order in @xmath1 ( and neglecting isospin violation in the @xmath8 form factors ) one finds that the amplitudes for the decays @xmath2 and @xmath3 coincide .",

    "our result is in good agreement with the current central experimental value of @xmath28 including its sign , which is predicted unambiguously . by far",
    "the most important source of isospin breaking is due to the 4-quark penguin operator @xmath130 , whose contribution to @xmath28 is about 9% ( at @xmath131 ) .",
    "the other terms are much smaller . in particular",
    ", the contribution of the chromo - magnetic dipole operator , for which factorization does not hold , is less than 1% in magnitude and therefore numerically insignificant .",
    "hence , the most important isospin - breaking contributions can be calculated using qcd factorization .",
    "it follows from our result that these effects mainly test the magnitude and sign of the ratio @xmath132 of penguin coefficients .",
    "because of their relation to matrix elements of penguin operators , isospin - breaking effects in @xmath0 decays are sensitive probes of physics beyond the standard model . for example , scenarios in which the sign of @xmath28 is flipped could be ruled out with more precise data . in addition , in certain extensions of the standard model there exist local 4-quark operators yielding an isospin - breaking contribution to the decay amplitudes at leading power in the heavy - quark expansion .",
    "precise measurements of radiative decay rates would tightly constrain the corresponding wilson coefficients . here",
    "we confine ourselves to a brief illustration of the most interesting potential new physics effects in @xmath0 decays .",
    "a more detailed study will be presented elsewhere .",
    "new physics effects arising at some high energy scale manifest themselves at low energy through new contributions to the effective weak hamiltonian . as a first , popular example in which the operator basis is not enlarged , consider the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with minimal flavor violation , and with contributions to the @xmath133 decay rates that are enhanced in the large-@xmath134 limit taken into account beyond leading order @xcite . in this scenario",
    "new contributions to @xmath18 and @xmath20 are too small to have a significant effect . for low @xmath134 , @xmath135 is negative as in the standard model .",
    "however , for large @xmath134 the coefficient @xmath135 can take on both positive or negative values .",
    "positive values , which would flip the sign of @xmath28 , become more probable as @xmath134 increases ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . with more precise data , isospin breaking in @xmath0 decays could rule out significant regions of the mssm parameter space at large @xmath134 .",
    "we note that the sign of @xmath135 can also be flipped in supersymmetric models with non - minimal flavor violation , independently of @xmath134 , via gluino  down - squark loop graphs .    in a more general scenario",
    ", new physics effects can be parameterized in terms of additional contributions to the coefficients of the dipole operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 , contributions involving dipole operators @xmath136 and @xmath137 with opposite chirality than in the standard model , and a plethora of local 4-quark operators , the most general set of which can be taken as ( a factor of @xmath138 is included here for convenience only ) @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "the dirac structure @xmath142 can be any of the ten combinations @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 . here , as usual , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 .",
    "as an example , note that such an extensive list of 4-quark operators can arise in general supersymmetry models @xcite .    in a generic new physics model",
    "the wilson coefficients @xmath153 and @xmath154 need not be flavor independent @xcite .",
    "therefore , isospin - breaking effects can arise even if the photon in the first diagram in figure  [ fig : graphs ] is emitted from the @xmath69 or @xmath155-quark lines . taking this possibility into account",
    ", we find that at leading order the contributions to the coefficients @xmath74 are @xmath156 where @xmath157 , and we have introduced the new convolution integral @xmath158 the new physics contribution from the chromo - magnetic dipole operator is included in ( [ kinp ] ) despite its @xmath159 suppression , because it could potentially be large in models with strongly enhanced @xmath160 . in analogy with ( [ bqdef ] )",
    ", we define a quantity @xmath161 with corresponding coefficients @xmath162 given by equivalent expressions with all wilson coefficients replaced by their opposite - chirality counterparts .",
    "its contribution to the decay amplitude is @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is defined in analogy with ( [ alead ] ) in terms of the matrix element of the opposite - chirality operator @xmath136 . because this amplitude does not interfere with the leading standard model amplitude for @xmath0 its effect is likely to be suppressed .",
    "a remarkable fact is that there can exist local 4-quark operators yielding a leading ( i.e. , not power - suppressed ) contribution to the decay amplitudes , as indicated by the factor @xmath165 in the first term in @xmath166 and @xmath167 , which compensates the power suppression from the prefactor @xmath168 in ( [ bqdef ] ) .",
    "the origin of these terms can readily be understood by noting that the tensor operators @xmath169 have a leading - twist projection onto the @xmath45 meson .",
    "when fierz - transformed into the basis used above , such operators turn into tensor operators and operators with structure @xmath146 . the fact that such operators enter the amplitudes for exclusive radiative @xmath7 decays with large coefficients means that future , precise measurements of radiative decay rates will provide tight constraints on the corresponding wilson coefficients .",
    "we have presented a model - independent analysis of the leading isospin - breaking contributions to the @xmath0 decay amplitudes . in the standard model",
    "these effects appear first at order @xmath1 in the heavy - quark expansion .",
    "they can be expressed in terms of convolutions of hard - scattering kernels and meson light - cone distribution amplitudes of leading and subleading twist .",
    "we have evaluated these contributions at nlo in perturbation theory , neglecting however some numerically suppressed @xmath159 terms . with the exception of the matrix element of the chromo - magnetic dipole operator ,",
    "whose contribution is numerically small , factorization of the leading isospin - breaking contributions is expected to hold to all orders in perturbation theory .    to our knowledge",
    ", the analysis presented here provides the first example of a quantitative test of qcd factorization at the level of power corrections . as such , it lends credibility to the idea of factorization as a leading term in a well - behaved expansion in inverse powers of the @xmath69-quark mass . our prediction for the magnitude and sign of isospin - breaking is in good agreement with the present central experimental value of this effect .",
    "if this agreement persists as the data become more precise , it will be possible to place novel constraints on flavor physics beyond the standard model .",
