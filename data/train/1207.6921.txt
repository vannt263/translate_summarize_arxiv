    "few - particle systems with large two - particle scattering length @xmath0 possess universal properties that are independent of the short - range interaction details .",
    "the three - particle system was investigated theoretically by v. efimov more than 40 years ago @xcite but only in the last decade the cold - atom physics experiments @xcite confirmed his prediction for the existence of zero orbital angular momentum weakly bound three - particle states with asymptotic discrete scaling symmetry .",
    "this boosted the interest also in the universal systems with four or even more particles .",
    "in contrast to the three - body system where semi - analytical results have been obtained ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) , most of the theoretical studies of the four - body systems are numerical .",
    "in addition to the numerous bound - state calculations , e.g. , @xcite , also the collision processes have been investigated in the framework of hyperspherical harmonics ( hh ) @xcite , coordinate - space faddeev - yakubovsky ( fy ) equations @xcite or momentum - space alt , grassberger and sandhas ( ags ) equations @xcite .",
    "the studies include the elastic and inelastic atom - trimer @xcite and dimer - dimer scattering @xcite as well as the four - atom recombination @xcite .",
    "depending on the collision energy and the two - particle scattering length ( that can be manipulated by the external magnetic field in the cold - atom experiments ) all these reactions may get resonantly enhanced due to the presence of unstable tetramer states .",
    "such a resonant behaviour in the dimer - dimer relaxation and four - atom recombination , roughly consistent with theoretical predictions , was observed recently in experiments with ultracold atoms performed near the universal regime @xcite .",
    "the four - particle reaction , that , to the best of our knowledge , has not been studied so far , is the three - cluster recombination , i.e. , an inelastic collision of a dimer and two atoms leading to the two - cluster final state either with two dimers or with one atom and a trimer .",
    "due to time reversal symmetry , the amplitude for this process is equal to the amplitude for the three - cluster breakup of the initial two - cluster state .",
    "the latter is more directly related to the transition operators for the two - cluster reactions @xcite and is derived in the present work using the formalism of the ags four - particle scattering equations .",

    "this may have important consequences for the life time and stability of trapped ultracold atomic gases with small admixture of dimers : let s suppose that the trapping potential is lower than the kinetic energies of the recombination products , i.e. , they are able to escape the trap . neglecting other reactions like the four - atom or dimer - dimer - atom recombination that should be suppressed at not too high densities ,",
    "the atom density in the trap evolves with time according to @xmath114 thus , due to @xmath115 even at low dimer densities @xmath116 the dimer - atom - atom recombination may be as important as the three - atom recombination .",
