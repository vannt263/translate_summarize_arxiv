    "<S> notice that the dimerization @xmath1 is completely staggered , which seems to be the most interesting case at least in the context of spin ladders @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the the four - spin coupling @xmath0 in spin - orbital models originates in the standard superexchange interaction @xcite . in spin ladders </S>",
    "<S> , it can be interpreted as a result of the coulomb interaction between holes in a doped phase @xcite . here , unless stated otherwise , we assume an antiferromagnetic @xmath18 heisenberg energy scale .    </S>",
    "<S> much of the theoretical efforts have been focused on the study of the homogeneous chain both numerically @xcite and analytically @xcite . in general </S>",
    "<S> , the interesting features occur in the strong coupling regime where perturbation theory does not work . in these cases </S>",
    "<S> it is important to have access to exact results since they play the role of relevant testing devices for approximate non - perturbative methods . </S>",
    "<S> one such example is the point @xmath19 in the homogeneous chain , which is equivalent to the integrable su(4 ) exchange spin chain @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this fact has been not only useful to check numerical analysis @xcite but also relevant to trigger further non - perturbative studies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the purposes of this paper is to point out that there exists two other points in which the model ( 1 ) is still exactly solvable . equally important , </S>",
    "<S> both results are concerned with the strong coupling regime @xmath20 , namely @xmath21    the exact solution enables us to derive analytical expressions for the ground state energy and the low - lying gap excitation . to our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> the first case is a rare example where we can provide the exact value of the energy gap for an interacting spin chain with _ alternating _ bond strength . </S>",
    "<S> it should be emphasized that this result is both at a feasible value of the spin - peierls dimerization and in a physically meaningful regime of the coupling @xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the utility of these exact results are threefold . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , since the lowest gap excitation for case ( i ) is very small , it provides us a relevant check of the reliability of numerical and approximate non - perturbative methods to distinguish between gapped and gapless phases . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we present evidence that the second case is an example of a system with a spontaneous spin - peierls effect . </S>",
    "<S> this lends support to the prediction by nersesyan and tsvelick @xcite that _ negative _ four - spin interaction can induce non - haldane spin - liquid behaviour in spin ladders . </S>",
    "<S> the novelty here is that this fact is established at the very strong coupling regime @xmath22 , which is beyond the reach of the approach of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , together , they motivate us to study the gap behaviour for arbitrary values of dimerization and interaction and to search for possible gapless phases .    </S>",
    "<S> the exact integrability is derived by identifying the lattice statistical model whose row - to - row transfer matrix commutes with hamiltonian ( 1 ) with the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath23 given by ( 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such classical statistical system consists of two isotropic six vertex models coupled by the total energy - energy interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the row - to - row transfer matrix @xmath24 of a vertex model is usually written as the trace of an ordered product of boltzmann weights , @xmath25\\ ] ] where @xmath26 denotes the local boltzmann weights with auxiliary space @xmath27 and quantum space @xmath28 , parametrized by the spectral parameter @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the auxiliary and quantum spaces correspond to the horizontal and vertical degrees of freedom of the coupled six vertex models . in our case there are four possible states per bond .    </S>",
    "<S> essential to our approach is to notice that the boltzmann weights can be conveniently written in terms of two commuting temperly - lieb operators @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the identity operator . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , defining @xmath32 with @xmath33 denoting the exchange operator , we found that the @xmath34-matrix @xmath35 is given by @xmath36    the weight @xmath37 plays the role of the four - spin interaction @xmath0 while a combination with @xmath38 is responsible for the dimerization @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these weights belong to a more general class of systems , that originally appeared in integrable coupled potts models @xcite , and were recently rediscovered in the context of lorentz lattice gases and fuss - catalan algebras @xcite . for the cases we are interested in , their explicit expressions are @xmath39 where @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> as usual , the corresponding hamiltonian is obtained as the first - order expansion in @xmath29 of the logarithm of @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> by using the weights ( 5 ) it is not difficult to verify that we indeed recover the hamiltonian ( 1 ) , up to irrelevant re - scaling constants , at the values given by ( 2 ) . to make further progress we have to explore other properties of the transfer - matrix . in particular , we are interested to establish the inversion relation @xcite , since it in principle provides us the means to compute the ground state energy and excitation properties </S>",
    "<S> . we will start by considering the most involved model which is the case with non - null dimerization @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> for this system , the inversion identity follows from a combination between the usual unitary property , @xmath41 , and a less standard crossing relation for the weights @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> these operators are not independently crossing symmetric , instead they satisfy a novel `` mixed '' crossing property , which reads @xmath43^{t_2}(\\ln3-\\lambda)\\stackrel{1}{m }   , ~~\\alpha=1,2\\ ] ] where @xmath44 denotes the transpose and @xmath45 is a @xmath46 antidiagonal matrix both acting on the space @xmath47 .    together with unitarity , this crossing relation allows us to derive the following inversion identity , @xmath48^{l } \\mbox{id } + t^{+}(\\lambda)\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is a matrix whose elements for large l are exponentially small , @xmath50 , compared to the term proportional to the identity i d . </S>",
    "<S> this means that , in the thermodynamic limit , the last term in ( 7 ) vanishes , providing us a much simpler functional equation for all the transfer matrix eigenvalues . in particular , the largest eigenvalue @xmath51 per site satisfies @xmath52    with the help of unitarity , @xmath53 , it is possible to solve the functional equation ( 8) under plausible analyticity assumption in the region @xmath54 where the boltzmann weights are positive . </S>",
    "<S> the solution is given by @xmath55    we now have the basic ingredients to derive the exact value for the ground state energy per site @xmath56 of hamiltonian ( 1 ) at @xmath2 and @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> this value is obtained by computing @xmath58 , which reads @xmath59    the inversion relation and trigonometric periodicity impose stringent constraints to the form of the low - lying excitations . </S>",
    "<S> they should be described in terms of meromorphic functions having two independent periods @xmath60 and @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> this observation alone enables us to calculate the dispersion relation @xcite and from that one obtains the exact value for the gap . </S>",
    "<S> such gap corresponds to the energy necessary to create an excitation with total spin @xmath62 in the spin - orbital model ( i ) . </S>",
    "<S> here we omit further technicalities and present only the final result . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the triplet energy gap @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 ^ 2 = 0.00286 9614\\ ] ]    interesting enough , the energy gap is very small and this has an immediate application . </S>",
    "<S> it could be used to test if a given numerical or approximate non - perturbative method can really make a clear distinction between a small gap and a real gapless phase . in general </S>",
    "<S> , this is a difficult task , and we expect that our exact result will be quite relevant to determine suitability of multiprecision methods in spin ladders models . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , this should be important when one wants to predict the scaling behaviour of the gap as a function of the dimerization @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we turn next to the second solvable point @xmath65 and @xmath22 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath38 is null and we are only left with the product of two commuting isotropic six vertex models . from the point of view of the classical statistical model , this means that we are in fact dealing with an alternative representation of the sixteen - state potts model . by now several properties of the general @xmath66-state potts </S>",
    "<S> are fairly well understood . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the ground state and the triplet gap can be determined either by the inversion trick as above @xcite or by a direct mapping onto the @xmath67 heisenberg chain @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their exact expressions are @xmath68 + \\frac{1}{4 } = -1.98444 4091\\ ] ] and @xmath69}{[1+(2+\\sqrt{3})^{-j } ] } \\right ] ^2= 0.77960 4542\\ ] ]    further interesting results can still be derived from the mapping of the homogeneous spin - orbital model ( 1 ) at @xmath22 onto the the antiferromagnetic @xmath67 chain with anisotropy @xmath70 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first , it is possible to show that the gap of the first excitation in the sector of total spin @xmath71 vanishes exponentially as @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> the momentum of this excitation is @xmath73 , which is compatible with the interpretation that in the thermodynamic limit the system has two spontaneously dimerized ground states , in accordance with the lieb - schultz - mattis theorem @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result supports the prediction by nersesyan and tsvelick @xcite that a four - spin interaction may induce dimerized phases in spin ladder models . </S>",
    "<S> the bosonization arguments of ref.@xcite for the weak coupling regime @xmath74 together with our exact result at the very strong coupling point @xmath22 indicate that such dimerized phase should be robust for a rather large region of @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> next , one can explain the numerical observations by pati , singh and khomskii @xcite that the model ( ii ) , _ now _ </S>",
    "<S> _ for _ @xmath76 ( point @xmath77 in figure 1 of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , possesses an infinitely degenerated ground state . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , @xmath76 corresponds to the _ ferromagnetic _ regime of the @xmath67 chain , whose @xmath78 finite entropy for @xmath79 is exactly computed to be @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> this value is a rigorous confirmation of the lower bound proposed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for such residual entropy .    considering these exact results , </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to ask if a combined effect of dimerization and @xmath81 four - spin interaction could lead to a gapless regime . to investigate this problem </S>",
    "<S> we numerically diagonalize the hamiltonian ( 1 ) , with periodic boundary conditions , up to l=14 sites by using a lanczos - type algorithm . in table 1 </S>",
    "<S> we exhibit our numerical results for the ground state energy and the triplet energy gap for both cases ( i ) and ( ii ) . </S>",
    "<S> the extrapolations towards the infinite volume limit was performed by using the van den broeck - schwartz method of convergence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while the results for the ground state are in good agreement with the exact values , the gap estimates have a rather poor accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> this emphasizes the importance of our exact results , since they clearly show that one can not trust the numerical gap estimates beyond two significant digits . </S>",
    "<S> however , this does not prevent us to make a _ qualitative _ comparison of the behaviour of the gap in the whole dimerization region @xmath82 for various values of the interaction @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in figure 1 for three values of @xmath0 in the strong coupling regime . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that indeed for each value of @xmath23 the gap has a very small minimum for an appropriate value of the parameter @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> note that for @xmath57 this minimum occurs very near the solvable point @xmath2 where the gap is small but still finite . </S>",
    "<S> this helps us to establish an upper bound for @xmath23 , beyond which one probably should rule out strictly null mass gaps . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath83 we observe , however , that this minimum decreases faster towards zero , suggesting the possibility of a gapless line on the plane @xmath84 in the @xmath85 regime . it would be interesting to confirm the existence of this massless line via more powerful numerical methods such as the density matrix renormalization group @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , this method will allow us to determine with good accuracy the critical value @xmath23 where the gapless line starts . in practice , however , when a gap is as small as we calculated , its effect would be invisible at even low temperatures which may still be considerably higher than the value of the gap .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have pointed out the existence of two integrable points in the spin - orbital model where relevant physical quantities such as the ground state energy and the excitation gap can be evaluated exactly . </S>",
    "<S> these results together with the solvable su(4 ) symmetric point seem to exhaust all possible bethe ansatz integrable cases of hamiltonian ( 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our numerical analysis indicate the possibility of a gapless line on the plane @xmath86 for @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> this then will add other example of coupled spin chains in which suitable combination of dimerization and interaction strength is capable to close the energy gap @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also hope that our observations will motivate further numerical and analytical investigation in related systems . </S>"
