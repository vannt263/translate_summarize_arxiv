    "most fundamental physical stellar parameters of field white dwarfs , such as effective temperature , surface gravity , and magnetic field strength can directly be measured with high precision from spectroscopic observations .",
    "assuming a mass - radius relation , both mass and radius may be inferred independently of the distance . determining these properties also for the accreting white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) is a relatively new research field , essential not only for testing stellar ( binary ) evolution theory , but for understanding the physics of accretion in this whole class of binaries .",
    "the last years saw a rapid growth of identified polars , cvs containing a synchronously rotating magnetic white dwarf . despite the large number of know systems ( @xmath6 ) rather little",
    "is known about the temperatures of the accreting white dwarfs in these systems .",
    "the main reasons for this scarcity are twofold .",
    "( a ) in the easily accessible optical wavelength band , the white dwarf photospheric emission is often diluted by cyclotron radiation from the accretion column below the stand - off shock , by emission from the secondary star , and by light from the accretion stream .",
    "even when the accretion switches off almost totally and the white dwarf becomes a significant source of the optical flux ( e.g. schwope et al . 1993 ) , the complex structure of the zeeman  splitted balmer lines and remnant cyclotron emission complicate a reliable temperature determination .",
    "( b ) at ultraviolet wavelengths the white dwarf entirely dominates the emission of the system during the low state and may be a significant source even during the high state .",
    "however , the faintness of most polars requires time - consuming space based observations ( e.g. stockman et al .",
    "iue observations of rxj1313.2@xmath03259 ( henceforth rxj1313 ) were carried out in march , 1996 .",
    "one swp ( 1150@xmath01980 ) and one lwp ( 1950@xmath03200 ) low resolution spectrum were obtained on march 2 and march 6 , respectively ( table1 ) .",
    "the lwp image was taken prior to the failure of gyro#5 , read - out of the image had to await that control over the spacecraft was re - established .",
    "both observations were taken through the large aperture , resulting in a spectral resolution of @xmath7 .",
    "because of the faintness of rxj1313 , the exposure time of the swp spectrum was chosen roughly equal to the orbital period .",
    "the spectra have been processed through the iuenewsips pipeline , yielding flux and wavelength calibrated spectra .",
    "the swp spectrum is shown in fig[f - swp ] .",
    "it is a blue continuum with a flux decline below @xmath8 . due to the long exposure time",
    ", the spectrum is strongly affected by cosmic ray hits .",
    "some emission of civ@xmath91550 and heii@xmath91640 may be present in the spectrum of rxj1313 , but from the present data no secure detection of line emission can be claimed .",
    "the absence / weakness of emission lines strongly indicates that the iue observations were taken during a period of very low accretion activity .",
    "the broad flux turnover below @xmath8  is reminiscent of the photospheric  absorption observed during low states , e.g. in amher @xcite or dpleo @xcite .",
    "our first approach was , thus , to fit the swp data with non - magnetic pure hydrogen white dwarf model spectra @xcite .",
    "however , none of the models could satisfyingly describe the observed spectrum . while the continuum requires a rather low temperature , @xmath10k , the steep slope in the narrow core of the  absorption ( @xmath11 ) is in disagreement with the very broad  line of such low - temperature models .",

    "we , therefore , fitted the iue data of rxj1313 with a two - temperature model , using again our non - magnetic pure hydrogen model spectra and leaving four free parameters ; the temperatures and scaling factors of both components .",
    "the best fit is achieved by a white dwarf with a `` base '' temperature of @xmath1k and a `` spot '' temperature of @xmath2k ( fig.[f - swp ] ) . for a distance @xmath12pc , as derived by thomas et al .",
    "@xcite , the white dwarf radius resulting from the scaling factors is @xmath13 cm . assuming the hamada - salpeter ( 1961 ) mass - radius relation for a carbon core , the corresponding mass is @xmath14 , which is consistent with the mass derived by thomas et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "because the iue / swp observation represents the orbital mean of the ultraviolet emission of rxj1313 , the spot size can not be directly estimated .",
    "assuming that the ultraviolet - bright spot shows a similar variation as the x - ray spot observed with rosat @xcite , we estimate a fractional area @xmath3 .",
    "for a somewhat larger spot , the temperature would be correspondingly lower .",
    "fig.[f - overall ] shows the iue swp and lwp spectra along with an average optical low state spectrum , as well as the two - component model .",
    "the flux of the lwp spectrum is somewhat lower than predicted by the model , which could be due either to heavy underexposure ( table1 ) or to the fact that the lwp spectrum covers only @xmath15 of the orbital period , possibly resulting in a lower spot - contribution than in the orbital - averaged swp spectrum , or both .",
    "the agreement of the model spectra with observed optical flux is reasonably good , especially when considering that only the 12251900  range was used for the fit and that the ultraviolet and optical spectra were taken at different epochs .",
    "the summed spectrum of the white dwarf model and a red dwarf matching the red end of the rxj1313 spectrum has @xmath16 , which is in agreement with the observed low - state magnitude of the system @xcite . during the low state ,",
    "the optical and ultraviolet emission of rxj1313 is , hence , dominated by its two stellar components .    for completeness , we mention that an additional possible source of  absorption is the interstellar gas .",
    "we computed the interstellar  profile for the absorption column derived from the x - ray data , @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the width of this line is smaller than the geocoronal emission in the swp spectrum .",
    "thus , interstellar absorption can not explain the narrow `` core '' observed in the iue spectrum .",
    "a major uncertainty in the computation of realistic hydrogen line profiles in magnetic atmospheres is the treatment of the stark broadening in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the stark broadening of the individual zeeman components is smaller than that of the entire transition in the non - magnetic case , but no detailed calculations are available .",
    "this uncertainty can be taken into account by treating the amount of the stark broadening as a free parameter in the model atmosphere calculation and calibrating it with observations @xcite .",
    "for , this approach is , however , difficult . on one hand , there are only few single magnetic white dwarfs for which good ultraviolet spectroscopy has been obtained . on the other hand ,",
    "the three zeeman components of  become visible as individual absorption features only for fields @xmath18 mg . for lower field strengths the  profile",
    "is still dominated by the stark effect and the zeeman shifts introduce only an additional broadening which is , again , difficult to quantify .",
    "an additional problem in the computation of synthetic  profiles arises for low - temperature atmospheres ( @xmath19k ) . in ultraviolet observations of non - magnetic white dwarfs in this temperature range , quasi - molecular absorption of @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath21 produces strong absorption features at @xmath8  and @xmath22 , respectively , which are overlayed on the red wing of  @xcite .",
    "calculations of these transitions in the presence of a strong magnetic field have not yet been approached .",
    "we have retrieved the iue spectra available for all magnetic white dwarfs listed by jordan @xcite , and find that in at best two of them the @xmath20 feature can be identified ( bpm25114 , @xmath23 mg and kuv23162@xmath01230 , @xmath24 mg ) .",
    "also , none of the accreting magnetic white dwarfs in polars with @xmath19k observed in the ultraviolet display noticeable @xmath20 absorption @xcite . from fig.[f - swp ] it is apparent that also the spectrum of rxj1313 is devoid of noticeable absorption at 1400  and 1600 . in summary , observations indicate that the @xmath20 and @xmath21 quasi - molecular absorption lines may be weaker in a strongly magnetic atmosphere than in a non - magnetic one .    assuming a magnetic field strength of @xmath25 mg for rxj1313 , as derived by thomas et al .",
    "@xcite from the cyclotron emission , the expected shift of the @xmath26 components is @xmath27 , causing the centre of the @xmath28 component to coincide with the steepest slope of the  profile .",
    "while the zeeman effect may broaden the observed  profile , the reduced stark broadening will cause an opposite effect .",
    "we estimate that the use of non - magnetic model spectra in the analysis of the profile may cause a temperature error of a about @xmath29k .",
    "we conclude that the theoretical uncertainties in the stark broadening do presently not warrant the use of magnetic model spectra .",
    "the narrow core in the broad  absorption observed in rxj1313 can not be produced by magnetic effects supporting our interpretation of a rather cool white dwarf with a localized hot region .",
    "it is well established that the white dwarfs in cvs tend to be hotter than single white dwarfs .",
    "this observational result suggests that accretional heating takes place in addition to the secular core cooling of the white dwarfs in cvs ( e.g. sion 1991,1999 ) .",
    "furthermore , the white dwarfs in cvs below the period gap are on average cooler than those in cvs above the gap ( gnsicke 1997,1998 ; sion 1991,1999 ) .",
    "a combination of two effects is thought to be responsible for this difference : ( i ) the average age of the short - period cvs below the period gap is about an order of magnitude larger than that of cvs above the gap @xcite and core cooling of their white dwarfs has progressed correspondingly ; ( ii ) the average accretion rate in short - period cvs is about an order of magnitude lower than in long - period cvs @xcite , resulting in reduced accretional heating .",
    "warner @xcite shows  admittedly only for a small sample of cvs  that the expected correlation between accretion rate and white dwarf temperature does , in fact , exist .",
    "rxj1313 is the polar with the fourth - longest period .",
    "it is , therefore , expected to be rather young , to experience a comparatively high time - averaged accretion rate , and to have a correspondingly hot white dwarf .",
    "contrary to these expectations , however , it harbours the coldest white dwarf of all the cvs above the period gap .",
    "in fact , the temperature of the white dwarf in rxj1313 is comparable to the average white dwarf temperature in short - period cvs .",
    "we suggest two possible scenarii which can explain the atypically low white dwarf temperature .",
    "\\(a ) rxj1313 has only recently developed from a detached pre - cataclysmic binary into the semi - detached state .",
    "mass transfer is in the process of turning on and substantial heating of the white dwarf has not yet taken place . in this case",
    ", the observed effective temperature of the white dwarf allows to estimate a lower limit on the cooling age and , thereby , on the time elapsed since the system emerged from the common envelope .",
    "the time scale for the turn - on of the mass transfer is @xmath30yrs , which is short compared to the @xmath31yrs that a cv spends above the gap @xcite .",
    "the probability of finding a cv in this stage of its evolution is rather small , but non - zero .",
    "\\(b ) rxj1313 is a `` normal '' long - period cv , but has more recently experienced a low accretion rate for a sufficiently long time interval ( @xmath5yrs ) which allowed its white dwarf to cool down to its current temperature .",
    "long - term ( @xmath32yrs ) fluctuations of the accretion rate about the secular mean predicted from angular momentum loss by magnetic braking @xcite are consistent with the large range of observed accretion rates at a given orbital period @xcite .",
    "two possible explanation for these fluctuations have been suggested .",
    "( b1 ) a limit - cycle in the secondary s radius driven by irradiation from the hot primary ( king et al .",
    "1995,1996 ) which causes a corresponding variation in the mass transfer rate .",
    "( b2 ) cvs possibly enter a prolonged phase of low ( or zero ) @xmath33 following a classical nova eruption , referred to as hibernation @xcite .",
    "rxj1313 may be such a hibernating cv .",
    "however , the low temperature of the white dwarf in rxj1313 argues against a very recent nova explosion . in v1500cyg , the white dwarf cooled from the nuclear burning regime , i.e. several @xmath34k in 1975 to @xmath35k in 1992 @xcite . on the theoretical side , prialnik ( 1986 )",
    "shows in a simulation of a 1.25  classical nova that the white dwarf reaches its minimum temperature @xmath36yrs after the nova explosion .",
    "two observational tests could help to decide whether rxj1313 is a rather `` fresh '' post - nova with its secondary only marginally filling its roche - lobe : ( 1 ) a nova eruption may break synchronization , as observed in v1500cyg @xcite , causing the orbit to widen and the secondary to retreat from its roche lobe .",
    "the resynchronization of the white dwarf spin with the orbital period occurs in v1500cyg apparently on a time scale of a few hundred years @xcite .",
    "more accurate ephemerides of rxj1313 than presently available ( thomas et al .",
    "1999 ) are necessary to test for a small remnant asynchronism of the white dwarf spin .",
    "( 2 ) the nova eruption may contaminate the binary system with material processed in the thermonuclear event , resulting in deviations from the typical populationi abundances found in most cvs @xcite .",
    "anomalous ultraviolet emission line ratios similar to those observed in post - novae have been found in the asynchronous polar bycam @xcite .",
    "the white dwarf in bycam has @xmath37k @xcite , which is in rough in agreement with the temperature expected a few 1000 years after a nova explosion .",
    "bycam contains also a slightly asynchronously rotating white dwarf , which leaves the question of the expected time scale for resynchronization somewhat unsettled .",
    "high - state ultraviolet observations of the cno lines in rxj1313 do not exist so far and will serve to test the post - nova hypothesis . if no evidence for a nova event should be found , rxj1313 is either very young as a cv or experiences a prolonged low state in some kind of mass transfer cycle .    before we discuss the temperature of the white dwarf photosphere , = 15000k , we comment on the `` warm '' ultraviolet - bright spot with @xmath38k .",
    "rxj1313 is yet another polar in which the white dwarf appears to have a non - uniform temperature distribution .",
    "other examples are amher @xcite , dpleo @xcite , or qstel @xcite . these hot spots are best explained by the localized irradiation of the photosphere with cyclotron and x - ray photons from the accretion funnel which is continuously fed at a low rate . in the case of rxj1313 , we estimate the luminosity of the ultraviolet - bright spot to be @xmath39 , corresponding to an accretion rate of @xmath40 , which is consistent with the low - state accretion rate , @xmath41 , derived by thomas et al . @xcite .    we now discuss accretion heating of the white dwarf in rxj1313 .",
    "as shown by giannone & weigert @xcite and by sion @xcite this is an inherently time - dependent process .",
    "accretion compresses the outer non - degenerate layers of the white dwarf which heat up approximately adiabatically if the accretion rate is high .",
    "the core suffers some compression , too , which heats primarily the non - degenerate ions . for intermittent accretion ,",
    "the thermal inertia of the deep heating produces a time delay which causes an enhanced luninosity long after accretion stopped . for very low accretion rates , @xmath42 ,",
    "on the other hand , prolonged accretion may lead to a quasi - stationary state in which the energy loss balances compressional heating @xcite and the temperature profile of the envelope remains stationary .    the simplest way to view",
    "compressional heating is to consider the energy released when the accreted mass is added .",
    "since the envelope mass is small and represents a practically constant fraction of the white dwarf mass , @xmath33 increases the mass of the degenerate core of mass @xmath43 , radius , and temperature .",
    "the energy released per unit time is g@xmath33(1/ 1/ ) of which some fraction feeds the initial degeneracy of the electrons reaching .",
    "apart from a factor of order unity , this energy equals the work performed by compression , @xmath44)/dt with @xmath45 the pressure and @xmath46 the density , integrated over the envelope .",
    "note that this energy release is different from that freed at the surface , which equals g@xmath33/  in an am her star , and represents the additional energy released by compression of the envelope of the white dwarf between radii  and .",
    "if compression is adiabatic , the work performed is used to increase the internal energy of the gas , as prescribed by the first law of thermodynamics . in the isothermal case",
    ", the released energy would completely appear as radiative loss .",
    "we consider here the case of slow compression and assume that the energy released by accretion at a rate @xmath33 equals the increment in luminosity @xmath47 where g is the gravitational constant , and we estimate that @xmath48 is between 0.5 and 1.0 .",
    "core heating is a minor effect and adds only @xmath49% to @xmath50 .",
    "hence , the compressional energy is primarily released in the envelope , at an approximately constant rate per radius interval .    in equilibrium , accretion at a rate @xmath33 can maintain an effective temperature  of the white dwarf defined by , even if the white dwarf had cooled to a substantially lower temperature before the onset of accretion .    in their discovery paper , thomas et al .",
    "( 1999 ) derive a mass of the white dwarf in rxj1313 of @xmath51  and a secondary mass of @xmath52 , with uncertainties of about 0.10",
    ". there was some concern about the mass ratio which should be @xmath53/@xmath54 for stable mass transfer .",
    "for definiteness , we assume here @xmath55 .",
    "thomas et al .",
    "( 1999 ) also derived a mass accretion rate which is very low compared to other long period cvs .",
    "they observed the system over seven years and found that it hovers most of the time at low accretion luminosities corresponding to @xmath42 .",
    "only twice was the system found in an intermediate state with an accretion rate of @xmath56 , during the rosat all - sky - survey and in a subsequent optical follow - up observation in february 1993 .",
    "it was never observed at an accretion rate of @xmath57 , the typical value of cvs with = 45 h @xcite . to be sure ,",
    "the derived accretion rates depend ( i ) on the adopted white dwarf mass and ( ii ) on the soft x - ray temperature and the bolometric fluxes of the quasi - blackbody source , and the quoted rates are probably uncertain by a factor of @xmath58 .",
    "a white dwarf of 0.5  has a core radius = @xmath59 cm and a radius @xmath60 cm at = 15000k . for these parameters",
    ", we find an equilibrium temperature from compressional heating alone of  @xmath61  k , where @xmath62  k is the accretion rate in units of @xmath63 .",
    "the observed temperature of 15000k can be maintained by an accretion rate of @xmath64  for @xmath65 , which is within the observed range of mass transfer rates .",
    "since the internal energy source of the white dwarf will contribute to the observed luminosity , the actual accretion rate required to maintain the photosphere at 15000 k may be somewhat lower .",
    "alternatively , the efficiency @xmath48 of converting the compressional energy release into the observed luminosity may be lower . within the uncertainties",
    ", however , it is also possible that the present temperature is almost entirely due to compressional heating and that the white dwarf had cooled to a temperature substantially below 15000 k prior to the onset of mass transfer . in any case , the cooling age of @xmath66yrs to reach 15000 k @xcite is a lower limit to the actual pre - cv age of the white dwarf . since the kelvin - helmholtz time scale of the envelope is roughly of the order of @xmath67yrs , the low temperature of the white dwarf requires @xmath33 to have been low for a comparable length of time .",
    "if rxj1313 is a cv in the process of turning on mass transfer we would expect that the accretion rate in rxj1313 would ultimately reach @xmath57  at which time the white dwarf has been compressionally heated to @xmath68k , the temperature typically observed in cvs with @xmath69h @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the low temperature of the white dwarf in rxj1313 is consistent with compressional heating by mass accretion at a rate substantially lower than the expected for a long period cv .",
    "the system has not passed through a phase of high accretion rate within at least the last @xmath67yrs which is the approximate kelvin - helmholtz time scale for the envelope .",
    "there are three possible previous histories of rxj1313 : ( a ) it is a young cv in the process of turning on the mass transfer ; ( b1 ) it is in a long - lasting phase of low accretion within an irradiation - driven limit cycle ; ( b2 ) it has passed through a nova outburst shutting off mass transfer for a prolonged period .",
    "we can not presently distinguish between cases ( a ) and ( b1 ) , while observational tests of ( b2 ) have been suggested above .",
    "we thank klaus reinsch for the optical spectrum of rxj1313 and for useful comments on the manuscript , and stefan jordan for discussions on magnetic model atmospheres .",
