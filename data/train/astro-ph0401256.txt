    "initial studies suggest that classical coronagraphs can potentially image even extrasolar terrestrial planets ( see the review by * ? ? ?",

    "electromagnetic effects will limit the practicality of all these designs .",
    "however , the more choices of masks we have explored using fraunhofer theory , the more likely it seems we may find a useful one for terrestrial planet finding . with extrasolar terrestrial planets in mind ,",
    "i attempt to develop a unified picture of coronagraph image masks to determine the range of potentially useful solutions to the fraunhofer diffracted - light problem .",

    "we will examine a one - dimensional coronagraph @xcite comprising an entrance aperture , @xmath0 , an image mask , @xmath1 , and a lyot stop , @xmath2 , each of which is represented by a complex - valued function constrained to have absolute value @xmath3 .",
    "we use the notational conventions of @xcite and @xcite ; letters with hats represent pupil plane quantities , and quantities transform as follows : @xmath4=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } \\hat m(x ) \\ , e^{-2 \\pi iux } \\ , dx.\\",

    "mostly we will discuss monochromatic effects , though sometimes we will consider the effects of finite bandwidth .",
    "we will use dimensionless units , but our units can be translated into physical distances as follows . in the pupil planes , our coordinates ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 )",
    "measure distance from the optical axis in units of the local pupil diameter , which for example , at the primary mirror would simply be @xmath7 , the diameter of the primary mirror . however , since the model is one dimensional , the primary mirror does nt have a diameter so much as a width ; it extends forever in one direction . in the image planes , our coordinates ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , etc . )",

    "an incoming wave incident on the entrance aperture creates a field with amplitude @xmath14 . in our model , when an incoming wave interacts with a stop or mask , the function representing the mask multiplies the wave s complex amplitude .",
    "so after the wave interacts with the entrance aperture , the amplitude becomes @xmath15 .    after interacting with the entrance aperture , the beam propagates to an image plane , where the new field amplitude is the fourier transform of the pupil plane field amplitude , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes convolution .",

    ".    notch filter masks for which @xmath48 for @xmath49 are called band - limited masks @xcite .",
    "band - limited masks are an important subset of notch - filter masks because as we will see below , only the low - wavenumber components of any mask affect the off - axis light .",
    "naturally , band - limited functions display wide variation , from the @xmath50 mask that optimizes inner working angle , to masks where @xmath51 is a prolate spheroidal wavefunction @xcite .",
    "these latter masks optimize search area .",
    "the gaussian mask @xcite is a good approximation to the prolate - spheroidal wavefunction band - limited mask .",
    "the next simplest solution to equation  [ eq : demandsonlythat ] is one that adds a linear slope to @xmath39 , while maintaining the needed translational symmetry .",
    "i.e. , @xmath52 figure  [ fig : calm]c shows an example of such a sawtooth - like function .",
    "when @xmath39 takes this form , @xmath53 and @xmath54 equations  [ eq : firstorder1 ] and [ eq : firstorder2 ] contain equations  [ eq : notch1 ] and [ eq : notch2 ] as a special case ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "mask functions @xmath51 that solve equations  [ eq : firstorder1 ] and [ eq : firstorder2 ] can always be decomposed into a sum of a notch - filter function and a @xmath56-function .",
    "for example , a @xmath57-function mask @xmath58 fills the bill .",
    "we can call notch filter masks `` zeroth order '' masks , and this @xmath57-function mask a `` first order '' mask .    of course",
    ", we can not build this @xmath59function mask .",
    "the closest we can come is to build a mask that is everywhere equally transparent , but that generates a phase shift of @xmath60 in the center : @xmath61 figure  [ fig : calm]d shows @xmath39 for this mask  it approximates the sawtooth - like exact solution of figure  [ fig : calm]c .",
    "the disk phase mask of @xcite is a two - dimensional version of this approximate solution .",
    "equation  [ eq : demandsonlythat ] shows that over some interval , @xmath39 , and therefore @xmath43 are periodic functions , with period @xmath62 .",
    "we can expand such functions as a fourier series : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are complex .",
    "this series satisfies equation  [ eq : demandsonlythat ] .",
    "however , this solution would completely specify the function over all @xmath8 ; equation  [ eq : demandsonlythat ] offers more freedom than that .",
    "we can express a complete solution as the sum of the above fourier series and any notch filter function : @xmath66 where and @xmath67 and @xmath68 , as long as @xmath69 in other words , all masks that completely remove on - axis light in a coronagraph with a tophat entrance aperture can be represented as the sum of a notch filter function and a series of @xmath56-functions located at @xmath70 .",
    "so far , we have only considered masks with all @xmath64 and @xmath65 equal to 0 , which we called zeroth order masks , or masks with only @xmath71 , which we called first order masks ( there is no @xmath72 .",
    "we can refer to masks with @xmath64 or @xmath73 , for @xmath74 as `` higher order '' masks .",
    "we can also consider the situation where the lyot stop is bigger than the entrance aperture ; @xmath75 . in this case",
    ", the solution to equation  [ eq : zero ] takes the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a high - pass filter function , i.e. one where @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "high - pass filter functions do not have any effect on the image , however ; the functional part of the mask is the series of @xmath56-functions .",
    "one example of a mask that works ( approximately ) for @xmath75 is the 1-d disk phase mask illustrated above .",
    "it does not suddenly fail if @xmath80 becomes small or negative  though the approximation to a @xmath56-function degrades towards the edges of the pupil plane .",
    "masks containing a row of @xmath56-functions may not be buildable , but we could build approximate versions , like the disk phase mask , and we could build low - pass - filtered versions of some masks by convolving the mask function with @xmath81 for example , ( though constructing such masks could be tricky ! ) .",
    "however , all masks in this series except for notch filter masks and first order masks face the following complication in a broad - band system . in a real optical system ,",
    "@xmath82 necessarily changes with the wavelength of the light , @xmath11 ; for an intensity mask , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the reference wavelength used for the purpose of defining the diffraction scale .",
    "other , wavelength - dependent effects may appear , or be built into the mask , but this dilation is intrinsic to a classical coronagraph .",
    "consequently , @xmath85 .",
    "the notch - filter solution , for which @xmath39 is constant over a large range in @xmath5 , can trivially be made to work over a large range in @xmath11 because of its dilation symmetry .",
    "however , all other solutions will only work at one wavelength , unless @xmath82 explicitly changes as a function of wavelength in some special way other than simple dilation .",
    "now we will assess the impact of a coronagraph on an off - axis source , like an extrasolar planets located at angle @xmath9 from the optical axis in the plane of the sky .",
    "we can proceed in the context of a more general problem , where @xmath25 and @xmath30 can be any functions at all that we can fourier transform .",
    "a band - limited mask is what - you - see - is - what - you - get ; a coronagraph with a band - limited mask attenuates the field from a distant source by a factor of @xmath86 and the point spread function ( psf ) in such a coronagraph does not depend on @xmath9 .",
    "but in general , the psf in a coronagraph depends on @xmath9 , and clearly , the shapes of many image masks do not directly show how the mask attenuates off - axis sources .",
    "how can we understand in general what a coronagraph does to image of an astronomical source ?",
    "@xcite showed that the high wavenumber components of the mask function , those with @xmath87 , do not affect how the mask interacts with off - axis light .",
    "consequently , for any mask , we can convolve @xmath51 with @xmath88 and get the same effective mask . for a notch filter mask",
    ", this operation just means looking the band - limited part of the mask , which as we mentioned , is trivial to interpret .",
    "we will apply a similar idea here to reveal the workings of any image mask .",
    "consider a point source , providing a field @xmath89 in the plane of the sky , and a harmonic mask function @xmath90 .",
    "the field after the entrance pupil is @xmath91 , and the field in the first image plane is @xmath92 .",
    "the field after the image mask is @xmath93 .",
    "the field in the second pupil plane is @xmath94 the field after the lyot stop is @xmath95 .",
    "the final field is @xmath96 * \\delta(x - x_1)$ ] . in other words ,",
    "the point source response of this particular special coronagraph is an intensity pattern @xmath97 centered at @xmath98 .",
    "we can evaluate the field amplitude at the center of the pattern simply by replacing the fourier transform with @xmath99 .",
    "then we see that the amplitude attenuation provided by this coronagraph at the center of the image of a point source is @xmath100 \\quad \\mbox{for a harmonic mask.}\\ ] ] the intensity at the center of the point spread function ( psf ) is @xmath101 .",
    "we can call @xmath102 the coronagraph s amplitude attenuation function and @xmath101 the coronagraph s intensity attenuation function .",
    "we can find the attenuation function for any arbitrary mask by expanding the mask function as @xmath103 .",
    "then the attenuation function becomes a fourier integral : @xmath104\\ , du \\\\ & = & \\mbox{ft}(m \\cdot ( l(u ) * a(-u)))(x_1 ) \\\\ & = & \\left[\\hat m * \\left ( \\hat l \\cdot \\hat a^\\dagger \\right ) \\right](x_1 ) , \\label{eq : attenuation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 denotes complex conjugation .",
    "this definition applies for any arbitrary entrance aperture , image mask , or lyot stop .",
    "the psf shape may change as a function of @xmath106 , the location of the off - axis source .",
    "however , the center of the psf is usually the maximum of the psf , so the attenuation function measures a critical feature of the mask for the purpose of finding off - axis point sources , like extrasolar planets .",
    "equation  [ eq : attenuation ] shows that while a mask may look to us like it has sharp edges , in some sense it looks to the sky like it is smooth ",
    "convolved with a smoothing kernal of the form @xmath107 . for example , the @xmath108function mask described above has an amplitude attenuation function @xmath109(x)$ ] .",
    "if the lyot stop is a tophat function and @xmath80 is small , then @xmath110 .",
    "if the image mask is band - limited , then @xmath111 .",

    "the left column shows image plane quantities , and the right column shows their pupil plane conjugates .",
    "figure  [ fig : construct]a , b , and c show the entrance aperture , @xmath0 , the image mask , @xmath1 , and the lyot stop , @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fig : construct]d shows the convolution of @xmath30 and @xmath25 and the image plane conjugate of this function , @xmath113 .",
    "these quantities act respectively as filter function and smoothing kernal .",
    "the amplitude attenuation function , @xmath112 , shown in figure  [ fig : construct]e , is a smoothed version of the mask .    in this example , @xmath30 * @xmath25 is a constant for @xmath114 , and zero for @xmath115 , as shown in figure  [ fig : construct]d .",
    "consequently , if @xmath43 were a band - limited mask function with power only where @xmath114 , then multiplying @xmath43 by @xmath116 would only serve to multiply @xmath43 by a constant .",
    "in other words , @xmath51 would be an eigenfunction of convolution with @xmath117 .",
    "figure  [ fig : compare ] shows @xmath51 and @xmath118 for several different image masks : a phase knife ( equation  [ eq : knife ] ) , a tophat mask , a one - dimensional disk phase mask ( equation  [ eq : phasedisk ] ) , a gaussian mask , and a band - limited mask ( @xmath119 ) . of the masks shown , only the phase knife and the band - limited mask provide @xmath120 . of those",
    ", only the band - limited mask provides perfect cancellation of on - axis light and the deep null needed for terrestrial planet finding .",
    "the attenuation function provides a good metric for the inner working angle , @xmath121 of a coronagraph .",
    "for example , we could define the inner working angle by @xmath122 . with this definition , and assuming a tophat lyot stop with @xmath123 , @xmath124 for the @xmath56-function image mask , and @xmath125 for a phase knife .",
    "for comparison , the smallest possible inner working angle for a band - limited mask is @xmath126except that for this band - limited mask , @xmath127 , so the coronagraph would have no throughput .",
    "notice that with a mask that is not a notch filter mask , apodizing the lyot stop makes @xmath128 into a broader function , which increases the coronagraph s inner working angle .",
    "likewise , we could push the inner working angle inwards if we replaced the lyot stop with a pair of pinholes at @xmath129 , for example .",
    "however , in reality , these distinctions probably do nt matter , because low order aberrations , like pointing error , will probably set the inner working angle of a real coronagraph      by taking derivatives of equation  [ eq : attenuation ] , we can construct a taylor expansion for @xmath112 about @xmath130 : @xmath131 \\ , du .",
    "\\label{eq : taylor}\\ ] ] consider a system where @xmath30 and @xmath25 have even symmetry .",
    "if @xmath43 has even symmetry then @xmath132 will vanish for all odd @xmath133 .",
    "if @xmath43 has odd symmetry then @xmath132 will vanish for all even @xmath133 .",
    "for example , in a coronagraph where @xmath134 and @xmath135 have even symmetry , if we use any image mask with odd symmetry , the on - axis final image field from an on - axis point source will be zero .",
    "mask functions , @xmath51 , with odd symmetry necessarily become negative , so they require manipulating the phase of the beam .",
    "the simplest such mask is the phase - knife coronagraph @xcite , for which @xmath136 a phase knife consists of a half - plane of glass joined to a half - plane of phase - retarding material so that the seam falls on the optical axis",
    ". we may be able to make a more practical version of this mask by laying an opaque strip over the seam so that the mask function becomes @xmath137 where @xmath138 is one or two diffraction widths .",
    "this variation retains the mask s odd symmetry , but removes the seams from direct illumination .",
    "though @xmath139 for the phase knife , the mask does not eliminate all on - axis light .",
    "the on - axis source may produce an image with zero central intensity , but with bright wings that can overwhelm the image of an off - axis planet .",
    "a perpendicular pair of phase knives , like the four - quadrant phase mask @xcite does a better job than a single phase knife at reducing these wings at the cost of some search area and also exactly satisfies equation  [ eq : zero ] for a circular entrance aperture and circular lyot stop .",
    ".null depth [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : table1 ]    however , the wings of the image of an on - axis point source are not the only drawback to the phase - knife mask",
    ". real stars do not provide perfect on - axis point sources ; stars have finite angular size and telescopes can not point at them perfectly accurately ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we must consider the intensity leak from slightly off - axis starlight , which we can approximate by @xmath140 , where @xmath9 is the angle off axis .    a common misconception is that disk phase masks are especially sensitive to pointing error .",
    "however , any coronagraph has a pointing error tolerance related to its inner working angle ; the smaller the inner working angle , the tighter the tolerance . disk plase masks have small inner working angles , so they have tight pointing tolerances .",
    "but at a given inner working angle , disk phase masks perform well .",
    "in general , the leak increases as some power of @xmath9 .",
    "equation  [ eq : taylor ] shows that the intensity leak from a mask with odd symmetry , like a phase - knife mask , is @xmath141 .",
    "a notch filter mask has even symmetry , so the intensity leak from a notch - filter mask is @xmath142 .",
    "the circular phase mask @xcite and the gaussian mask have @xmath143 , so they leak at @xmath144 , though the zeroth order leak can be made negligible .",
    "all masks of containing @xmath145 terms in equation  [ eq : complete ] produce an @xmath141 intensity leak .",
    "viewed at quadrature , reflected visible light from the earth is @xmath146 times as bright as direct light the sun .",
    "we do not need to suppress the starlight to quite this level in the center of the image plane since the planet appears typically a few diffraction widths from the star in the wings of the stellar leakage , which we can control with an apodized lyot stop if necessary . a reasonable assumption",
    "might be that for terrestrial planet finding , we can tolerate up to @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the effective pointing error ( which may contain some contribution from the star s finite angular size ) .",
    "given this assumption , we must center the star on the mask to an accuracy of roughly @xmath149 , where the mask s leak is @xmath150 , and @xmath121 is the coronagraph s inner working angle .",
    "for example , a fourth - order intensity leak , or a fourth - order `` null '' , to use the language of interferometry , translates into a pointing requirement of @xmath151 .",
    "table  1 summarizes the leading order intensity leaks from the masks discussed in this paper .",
    "we found a complete solution to the problem of removing on - axis light in a one - dimensional coronagraph with an un - apodized entrance aperture .",
    "however , several coronagraph designs , classical and otherwise , use apodized entrance pupils @xcite or specially shaped pupils @xcite .",
    "other designs use a pair of shaped mirrors to generate an apodized beam @xcite . these designs aim to suppress the wings of the psf so far that the edges of the image mask are not illuminated by the image of an on - axis source",
    ", so a simple tophat mask suffices to remove the on - axis light to the necessary level .",
    "achieving this suppression generally requires numerical optimization to find an approximate solution to equation  [ eq : zero ] .",
    "coronagraphs with apodized entrance apertures , like coronagraphs with apodized lyot stops , are especially robust to low - order aberrations",
    ".    we can also find new exact solutions to equation  [ eq : zero ] using an apodized entrance aperture and a phase mask @xcite .",
    "however , these exact solutions require @xmath51 to vary in a complicated way with wavelength .",
    "one design that provides a self - adjusting @xmath152 to be combined with an apodized entrance aperture is the achromatic dual - zone phase coronagraph @xcite .",
    "achromatic dual - zone phase masks can be designed with @xmath142 leak .",
    "combining image masks and apodized entrance pupils remains relatively unexplored territory  though perhaps such designs shold not be called classical coronagraphs .",
    "according to fraunhofer diffraction theory , uncountably many non - trivial image mask designs can completely remove the light from an on - axis source in a classical coronagraph with an un - apodized entrance aperture .",
    "we organize these designs using a trigonometric series solution to the equation @xmath153 .",
    "notch filter masks are the zeroth order solutions , and the only solutions that are trivially achromatic in our approximation over a large bandwidth .",
    "higher order solutions can be decomposed into the sum of a notch filter function and a series of @xmath154 functions ; the the disk phase mask @xcite approximates one term in the sum .",
    "we defined the mask amplitude attenuation function , @xmath112 , as the amplitude at center of the final image of a point source located at angle @xmath8 off - axis in the plane of the sky .",
    "this function , which we showed is a smoothed version of the mask function , provides an easy way to judge the null depth and inner working angle for non - band - limited masks . through this analysis",
    ", we showed that only masks with even symmetry can provide the null depth necessary for terrestrial planet searches ; for example , masks based on a phase knife do not provide the necessary null depth .",
    "we focused on a one - dimensional coronagraph with an un - apodized entrance aperture , though other designs may prove useful .",
    "for example , the full two - dimensional problem may yield surprises .",
    "some coronagraph designs use apodized entrance pupils  though classical coronagraphs with apodized entrance pupils generally require @xmath51 to vary with wavelength in a complicated way .",
    "it may also be possible to gain benefit by cascading multiple image plane masks .",
    "but neglecting these avenues , our analysis shows that our existing library of one - dimensional image mask designs is complete .",
