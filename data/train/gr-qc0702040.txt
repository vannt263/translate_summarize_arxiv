    "rotating neutron stars are a promising source of gravitational waves . indeed , their oscillations can become unstable , converting their rotational energy into gravitational radiation .",
    "it is of particular interest the instability of the @xmath0-modes , which are oscillation modes of the star associated with the coriolis force , and can become unstable at any rotation rate of the star @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that @xmath0-mode instability could produce waves strong enough to be detected by ligo and virgo@xcite .",
    "furthermore , these instabilities are thought to play an important role in astrophysics .",
    "for instance , they may be relevant in spinning - down newly born neutron stars ( and quark stars , if they actually exist ) @xcite , and could be responsible for preventing the spin - up of accreting neutron stars in low mass @xmath1-ray binaries @xcite .    in spite of the extensive literature dedicated to the study of the problem , our present understanding of @xmath0-mode instability of compact stars is still incomplete , with many controversial issues .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that , working at first order in perturbation theory and neglecting the coupling between different harmonics , leads to the existence of a continuous spectrum and makes doubtful the existence of the modes . however , non - perturbative numerical simulations @xcite seem to indicate that @xmath0-modes do exist , so that the continuous spectrum may be interpreted as an artifact due to an inconsistency of the perturbative expansion when @xmath2 . with this motivation ,",
    "more sophisticated methods to solve the eigenvalue problem have been developed @xcite .",
    "another interesting issue , which up to now has not been fully understood , is the role of viscosity in @xmath0-mode oscillations .",
    "it is believed that bulk / shear viscosity limit the instability at high / low temperatures , respectively . but a complete understanding of this mechanism is still missing .",
    "furthermore , it would be interesting to understand if the inclusion of viscosity does affect the existence of the continuous spectrum , as suggested for example in @xcite .    here",
    "we report the results of @xcite , where we have studied the effect of introducing shear viscosity to the @xmath0-mode oscillations frequencies and damping times .",
    "we have introduced shear viscosity from the beginning in the stress - energy tensor , solving perturbatively the einstein s equations ; in this way we have been able to evaluate consistently both the frequency and the damping time of the mode , for the first time .",
    "a similar self - consistent inclusion of the heat transfer corrections has recently been done in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have found that by including a small amount of viscosity we are able to regularize the continuous spectrum .",
    "we have considered a star rotating uniformly with angular velocity @xmath3 . at first order in @xmath3 ( or , more precisely , at first order in the rotational parameter @xmath4 with @xmath5 ) , the stationary background is described by the metric @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 represents the dragging of the inertial frames .",
    "it corresponds to the angular velocity of a local zamo ( zero angular momentum observer ) , with respect to an observer at rest at infinity .",
    "the @xmath8velocity of the fluid is simply @xmath9 , and the stress - energy tensor is @xmath10 we have assumed that viscosity does not affect the stationary axisymmetric background , because the shear tensor do vanish there .",
    "therefore , in this regime the einstein s equations reduce to the standard tov ( tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ) equations plus a supplementary equation for the frame dragging @xmath7 : @xmath11 where @xmath12 .    taking into account viscosity",
    ", the stress - energy tensor has the form ( see for instance @xcite ) : @xmath13 here @xmath14 are the shear and bulk viscosity coefficients ( see @xcite for a discussion on the meaning of these coefficients ) , and @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the projector onto the subspace orthogonal to @xmath17 @xmath18    we have focused our investigation to @xmath0-modes , which are perturbations with axial symmetry",
    ". therefore , we have considered axial perturbations of the metric ( [ metric ] ) , expanded in tensor spherical harmonics , and we have solved the einstein s equations , linearized around the background , for such perturbations : @xmath19 this approach allows to determine the complex frequency of the quasi - normal modes of the star ( and then , of the emitted gravitational radiation ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the real frequency of the mode , and @xmath22 is its damping time .",
    "we have neglected the coupling between perturbations with harmonic indexes @xmath23 and @xmath24 , as in @xcite . under this approximation ,",
    "bulk viscosity is not coupled to axial perturbations , because it enters into the equations only through the axial - polar @xmath25 couplings .",
    "thus , we only have studied the effects of shear viscosity , leaving the investigation of the effects of bulk viscosity for future work .    we also have considered the cowling and the newtonian limits of our equations , in order to make a detailed comparison with previous works .    because of numerical problems , we can not integrate our system of equations for @xmath26 km@xmath27 .",
    "and @xmath28g/@xmath29 is @xmath30km@xmath27 . ]",
    "here we discuss the results of the numerical integration of our perturbative equations , carried out in @xcite .",
    "we have studied different kinds of stellar models : constant density stars , polytropic stars and realistic neutron stars . in each case , we have compared the newtonian limit , the cowling approximation , and the relativistic calculation , in order to establish the qualitative differences between the three approaches and to compare to previous literature on the subject .      in the case of constant density stars",
    ", it has been shown that the frequencies of the @xmath31modes lay outside the continuous spectrum ( see e.g. @xcite for the full gr results ) .",
    "we consider a uniform density star with a central energy density of @xmath32 g/@xmath29 , mass of 1.086 @xmath33 and radius of 8.02 km ( @xmath34 ) , with the rotational parameter @xmath35 . in fig .",
    "1 we show the @xmath0mode frequency versus the viscosity parameter @xmath36 , assumed to be constant throughout the star . the newtonian , cowling , and general relativistic results are shown by dotted , dashed , and solid lines , respectively .",
    "the newtonian and gr frequencies in the inviscid limit ( 1064 hz and 1144 hz ) are indicated as dotted and solid horizontal lines , while the shadowed region indicates the continuous spectrum . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , as the viscosity decreases the inviscid newtonian and gr results are recovered , while the frequency in the cowling approximation falls inside the continuous spectrum .    since the convergence to the inviscid limit",
    "is reached for @xmath37 km@xmath27 , the mode frequency in the cowling approximation can be found extrapolating the dashed line for @xmath38 , and the corresponding value is 1244 hz , about a ten percent larger than the gr value .",
    "it should be stressed that the mode frequency in the cowling approximation in the inviscid limit had never been possible before for perfect fluids .",
    "we stress that , as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the newtonian , cowling and gr damping times coincide . all damping times differ for less than 20% and show a @xmath39 behaviour , as expected from previous estimates in the literature . in particular , we can compare our results with the analytic formula of @xcite , resulting from newtonian estimates of the dissipative time scale of the shear viscosity @xmath40 for our model @xmath41 , with @xmath36 in km@xmath27 and @xmath22 in s. this estimate is also shown in fig .",

    "as an example of the mean field solution to a relativistic walecka  type lagrangian we have used the parametrization usually known as gm3 @xcite .    if the compactness is @xmath34 , apr gives a mass of 1.53 @xmath33 and a radius of @xmath55 km , while gm3 gives @xmath56 and @xmath57 km . for a polytropic eos with @xmath44",
