    "recent accumulating experimental facts in heat capacity @xcite , thermal conductivity @xcite , penetration depth @xcite , and nmr data @xcite certainly indicate the presence of a new superconducting ( sc ) phase of cecoin5 at low @xmath1 and under high magnetic fields _ parallel _ to the sc layers .",
    "this new phase , separated from the ordinary abrikosov vortex lattice via a second order transition , is expected to be the fflo vortex lattice with one - dimensional periodic modulation of the sc order parameter @xmath2 _ parallel _ to the field @xmath3 based on a consistency between these observations and a recent theory @xcite on the characters of transitions between different phases .",
    "if the fflo modulation is _ perpendicular _ to @xmath3 , the mean field @xmath4-transition between the normal and the fflo state is usually expected to be of second order @xcite , just like the conventional result in the pauli limit @xcite .",
    "however , this is incompatible with the discontinuous @xmath4-transition @xcite in cecoin5 .",
    "spatial structures of a fflo state may also be reflected in its elastic properties , and the tilt response of vortices should be sensitive to the direction of the periodic modulation .    [",

    "the sc layer and the anisotropy axis correspond to the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane and the @xmath8-axis , respectively .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    in this paper , we examine changes of vortex tilt modulus occurring through the transition between the fflo vortex lattice with modulation parallel to @xmath3 and the familiar abrikosov lattice and show that , through a coupling between the vortices and the nodal planes accompanying the fflo modulation , a measurable reduction of vortex tilt modulus may occur in such an fflo state of uniaxially anisotropic superconductors in fields parallel to the sc layers .",
    "the present result may be relevant to the ultrasound experiment in cecoin5 @xcite , in which a _ monotonous _ reduction of sound velocity upon cooling through @xmath9 was observed only for a sound mode accompanied by vortex tilts .",
    "first , a qualitatively expected feature of the tilt response in the fflo state will be explained .",
    "the fflo state of our interest is the so - called lo state in which @xmath2 in equilibrium has a periodic modulation with a period @xmath10 parallel to @xmath5 and vanishes on periodic nodal planes lying in @xmath7-@xmath8 plane ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the continuous fflo to abrikosov transition at @xmath9 is characterized by a vanishing of the @xmath11 term in the mean field free energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the vortex line tension @xmath12 of the abrikosov lattice , which is one part of its total tilt modulus @xmath13 is defined from the gradient term in the _ fluctuation _ free energy for variations parallel to @xmath3 , where @xmath14 is the uniform flux density .",
    "then , as in the conventional elastic softening in the ordinary solids , it is natural to expect @xcite a tilt softening to occur on @xmath9 with a cusp - like minimum of @xmath12 ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "although such a behavior is generally expected for the so - called ff state with no nodal planes of the amplitude @xmath15 and presumably also for other modulated vortex lattices with nodal planes parallel to the vortices , this picture is , when applied to the lo state with periodic nodal planes perpendicular to the vortices , justified only in the limited case where the nodal planes are never coupled with the vortices . in the lo state , a tilted nodal plane can carry the magnetic flux , and hence , a vortex tilt is induced by a small tilt of nodal planes since the number of vortices should remain unchanged for a _ small _ variation .",
    "this statement is represented in terms of tilt angles @xmath16 and @xmath17 of the vortices and of the nodal planes ( see fig.1 ) , respectively , by the elastic energy @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the density of states per spin in the normal state , and the bracket @xmath20 denotes the spatial average .",
    "the dimensionless vortex line tension defined under fixed nodal planes is given by @xmath21 , @xmath0 is the corresponding tilt modulus of the nodal planes , and a nonvanishing coefficient @xmath22 of the coupling term is a consequence of the periodic modulation of the equilibrium @xmath2 .",
    "hereafter , the nonlocality arising from the long interaction range between the vortices is neglected in @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "then , the vortex line tension @xmath12 in the fflo state stabilized by a positive @xmath0 becomes @xmath24 .",
    "\\label{delc44}\\ ] ] equation ( [ delc44 ] ) implies that @xmath12 is reduced more drastically with decreasing @xmath0 . such a decrease of @xmath0 occurs due to an effective reduction of the orbital depairing because the modulation parallel to @xmath3 is supported by the orbital effect of the magnetic field . in quasi 2d superconductors under a field parallel to the sc layers , the orbital depairing effect becomes less important in more 2d - like systems where the paramagnetic depairing is relatively more important . in the pauli limit with no orbital depairing ,",
    "the direction of modulation is _ spontaneously _ chosen , i.e. , @xmath25 is vanishingly small , as far as a fermi surface ( fs ) anisotropy is negligible .",
    "thus , in highly 2d - like systems and/or a case with a larger maki parameter @xmath26 , the fflo state in @xmath5 should show a softer tilt response , for displacements @xmath27 , as a consequence of a large fluctuation of nodal planes induced by an enhanced paramagnetic depairing .",

    "our approach for describing the vortex lattices affected by the paramagnetic depairing takes the same route as the previous one @xcite and starts with a bcs hamiltonian @xmath36 for quasi 2d systems , where @xmath37 { \\varphi}_{j}^{\\sigma}({\\bf r_\\perp } ) ,   \\label{bcskin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath38    and @xmath39 with @xmath40 , where @xmath41 . here",

    "hereafter , the gauge field @xmath57 will be assumed to consist only of the contribution of the uniform flux density @xmath14 , i.e. , we work in the type ii limit with no spatial variation of flux density , because we are interested mainly in the field region near @xmath4 .",

    "the above inequality means that an increase of @xmath70 _ competes _ with an enhanced paramagnetic depairing .",
    "in fact , eq.([paulidame ] ) implies that , as the paramegnetic depairing is stronger under a fixed anisotropy , the fflo state just below @xmath65 tends to enter not the nearly 2d region in @xmath79 but the anisotropic 3d regime below @xmath80 in which repeated structural transitions between the josephson vortex lattices occur .",
    "nevertheless , the transitions between the ordinary josephson vortex lattices are not visible in most of quasi 2d materials , and the layer structure may be treated as an anisotropic 3d - like medium for most purposes as far as the intrinsic pinning effect of vortices does not become essential @xcite .",
    "then , the difference @xmath81 of the quasiparticle energy may be replaced by @xmath82 even in layered systems .",
    "consequently , the quadratic term of the gl free energy density is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the velocity field on the fs , @xmath85 , and an appropriate gauge transformation has been performed to make the gauge field parallel to the @xmath8-direction .",

    "although the above expression of the 6-th order term is apparently different from the corresponding one in @xcite , it can be numerically checked that both of them are the same as each other . by using the identity ( [ parameterint ] ) again , we obtain @xmath100 \\biggr\\rangle_{\\rm fs } , \\nonumber \\\\ { \\hat k}_6 & = & - \\frac{6}{t_c^4 } \\ ,",

    "first , as already mentioned , we assume the fflo state in equilibrium to be described in the lowest ( @xmath101 ) ll where no nodal points or lines except the field - induced vortices of @xmath15 are present in the @xmath7-@xmath8 plane perpendicular to @xmath3 . instead",
    ", nodal planes perpendicular to @xmath3 are periodically formed .",
    "if the @xmath128-dependence of the free energy is incorporated only from the quadratic term @xmath129 , the transition line between the lo state and the abrikosov state is the same as that between the ff and abrikosov states , where @xmath128 is the wavenumber corresponding to the period between the fflo nodal planes .",
    "however , once the @xmath128 dependence of the free energy from the higher order terms , @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) , is considered , as pointed out elsewhere @xcite in the @xmath30 case , the transition temperature between the lo and abrikosov states is higher than that between the ff and abrikosov states . for this reason",
    ", we will not consider a possibility of appearance of the ff state .",

    "this simplification is in part based on the fact that it has been verified @xcite that the @xmath140 dependences of @xmath141 are unimportant even quantitatively for the position of the fflo to abrikosov transition in @xmath30 .",
    "further , to study systematically possible phase diagrams including fflo states , inclusion of @xmath140-dependences in higher order terms requires a difficult numerical task . on the other hand ,",
    "if even the @xmath140 dependence of @xmath142 is neglected , the @xmath14-@xmath1 region in which the fflo state can appear is highly overestimated , and , as is seen in sec.iii , a fictitious tilt instability of the fflo state occurs .",

    "imagining cecoin5 in several tesla and , as a rough estimation , taking the values @xmath247 ( a ) and @xmath248 ( a ) , the resulting @xmath249 values in the fflo state near @xmath9 are two order of magnitude smaller than @xmath174 .",
    "this small value of reduction of @xmath250 will partly become larger by taking account of the dispersive main term @xcite of @xmath23 ( the @xmath251 dependences of the @xmath252 term ) .",
    "the present result may be relevant to the observation in the ultrasound measurements @xcite , where the normalized sound velocity @xmath253 has shown a reduction upon cooling through @xmath254 for the displacements of the underlying crystal perpendicular to @xmath3 ( lorentz mode ) , while no signature of a comparable magnitude has been seen for displacements parallel to @xmath3 ( nonlorentz mode ) .",
    "this remarkable anisotropy of phenomena is an evidence of a structural change on @xmath9 of the vortex state .",
    "since , strictly speaking , a pinning of the nodal planes due to the crystal lattice is present in the latter , this fact implies that the pinning of the nodal planes is quantitatively negligible .",
    "in contrast , in the lorentz mode , not the nodal planes but the vortices couple to the crystal displacement , and consequently , the observed reduction of @xmath253 in this mode in entering the fflo state implies some reduction of @xmath23 and/or of the vortex pinning strength .",
    "first , the _ overall _ temperature variation of @xmath253 surviving at low enough @xmath223 likely reflects that of the order parameter amplitude @xmath255 carried by the pinning strength ( see fig.3 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the data of quantities measuring @xmath256 @xcite show a reduction of @xmath256 , due to an increase of @xmath140 @xcite , upon entering the fflo state compared to the extrapolation of @xmath255 in the abrikosov state to lower temperatures .",
    "thus , the _ relative _ reduction of @xmath255 and hence of the pinning strength may be one origin of the @xmath253-reduction in entering the fflo state .",
    "on the other hand , the reduction of @xmath23 , obtained in the present work , upon entering the fflo state , also leads to a reduction of @xmath253 in the lorentz mode @xcite .",
    "the feature seen in fig.3 that the @xmath23-reduction is more remarkable in higher fields is consistent with the field dependence of the observed anomalies @xcite .",
    "although the reduction of @xmath23 estimated above seems to be too small to quantitatively explain the observed reduction of @xmath253 , we expect this discrepancy to be partly resolved by going beyond the gl expansion in @xmath2 because @xmath257 has been presumably underestimated in the gl analysis of the present case with a discontinuous @xmath4-transition .    for comparison , @xmath12 in @xmath30",
    "was also examined by adding a small _ noncylindrical _ portion with large @xmath258 , stabilizing @xcite an fflo in @xmath30 , to the cylindrical fs .",
    "although , as given in fig.2 , it shows the _ familiar _ type of softening behavior of @xmath12 at @xmath254 , this cusp - like feature is not visible on the scale of fig.4 ( see the dotted curve ) , and , as shown there , the temperature variations of @xmath12 and @xmath207 are quite weak around @xmath254 .",
    "thus , changes of the tilt response through @xmath254 in @xmath30 are negligible .",
    "the presence in @xmath5 and the absence in @xmath30 of a clear peak effect in magnetization data of cecoin5 near @xmath254 @xcite might be related to the corresponding difference in @xmath23 mentioned above , because a peak effect occurs reflecting a notable change of a vortex elastic modulus @xcite .    throughout this paper , we have focused on the case in which vortex lattices _ in equilibrium _ are described in the lowest ll . as shown elsewhere",
    ", @xcite a higher ll vortex lattice tends to occur in `` clean limit '' , which is defined as the case with infinitely long quasiparticle s ( qp s ) mean free path , and in the case with large @xmath259 .",
    "in fact , in fig.3 ( a ) , the @xmath33 ll vortex lattice with additional nodal lines in the plane perpendicular to @xmath3 occurs in much lower temperatures than the range shown there .",
    "such an appearance of higher ll states due to a large @xmath259 under a _ strictly parallel _ field to the layers is closely related to a different issue @xcite of transitions between 2d vortex lattices in the large @xmath70 limit induced by a tilt of the applied field from the parallel field configuration .",
    "however , the @xmath33 ll state in the present case is easily pushed down to @xmath55 due to a finite but nevertheless quite long qp s mean free path and is expected not to occur at measurable temperatures in cecoin5 @xcite . in relation to this , it will be valuable to point out that the 2d higher ll vortex lattices due to the tilt of the applied field @xcite may be expected only when the opposite relation to eq.([paulidame ] ) , i.e. , @xmath260 is satisfied . in fact , the neglect @xcite of the orbital depairing effect in the case with a strictly parallel field is equivalent to assuming the absence of structural transitions between different josephson vortex lattices , and this assumption is justified only in higher fields than @xmath261 @xcite .",
    "for cecoin5 with a weak anisotropy @xcite , eq.([paulidame2 ] ) is never satisfied .    in conclusion ,",
    "the vortex tilt modulus @xmath23 in the fflo state modulating along @xmath3 may be reduced due to tilts of the nodal planes .",
    "this @xmath23-reduction should be remarkable especially in quasi 2d materials with a strong paramagnetic depairing in the parallel field , in which the nodal planes are fixed only weakly by the field direction , and may be an origin of the reduction of sound velocity in the lorentz mode upon entering the fflo phase observed in cecoin5 .",

    "no quadratic terms in @xmath273 occur from the sum of the resulting @xmath278 term and @xmath279 .    here",
    ", let us first examine eq.([b2 ] ) by neglecting the @xmath6 dependences . then , when @xmath280 where @xmath281 is the vortex displacement field , the famous josephson relation @xmath282 or @xmath283 implying a nonvanishing vortex flow resistance , follows as a condition for minimizing the fluctuation free energy .",
    "in fact , this josephson relation implies the vanishing of the static superfluid rigidity @xmath175 to a current perpendicular to @xmath3 , because this relation implies that @xmath284 is lost ( eaten ) by the @xmath33 ll fluctuation from @xmath285 so that @xmath286 .",

    "then , the familiar total tilt modulus @xmath292 is obtained for this abrikosov vortex lattice . in general",
    ", @xmath12 does not have to be equivalent to @xmath293 : as shown in the text , @xmath12 can become negative in the fflo vortex lattice , while @xmath294 of the fflo vortex lattice is always positive because the magnetic field tends to destroy superconductivity and hence , increases the condensation energy .",
