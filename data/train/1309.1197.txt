    "<S> working in scaled units where masses are measured in units of @xmath1 and velocities are measured in units of @xmath10 , the velocity probability density is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the number of spatial dimensions .    the mean collision rate @xmath9 may be obtained through a standard flux argument that counts the total number of collisions in a given volume during some arbitrary time interval.@xcite the condition of molecular chaos is assumed : in the encounter between two spheres their initial velocities are uncorrelated prior to the collision . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption allows one to express the collision probability in terms of a product of equilibrium velocity distributions . in considering the effect of finite molecular volume one must grapple with the fact that the average density @xmath4 inadequately represents the number of molecular centers in a given volume of space where scattering occurs . </S>",
    "<S> a density for the number of molecular centers a given distance from a chosen molecule is discontinuous since no two sphere centers can be closer than a diameter . </S>",

    "<S> this leads to @xmath15 to @xmath16 , the absolute value of the jacobian being unity , and the evenness of the velocity distribution allows us to write @xmath17 the inner integral defines the equilibrium probability density for the relative velocity , meaning that the outer integral simply computes the mean relative speed in the gas . </S>",

    "<S> sampling velocities from a gaussian distribution would not be consistent with the requirement that the time @xmath22 represents the entire time of free flight of the tagged molecule . </S>",
    "<S> sampling from a gaussian distribution means that one is choosing a particle at random at any moment in its flight rather than some moment a very short time preceding an encounter with another sphere . in the former case </S>",
    "<S> the time @xmath22 would exclude the remaining time left on the particle s linear path to its next collision .    the desired probability distribution for the time @xmath22 of a free path is @xmath40 by a similar construction we may obtain the probability distribution for the length @xmath41 of a free path . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath42 is formed from a product of three terms : the probability that a molecule of speed @xmath21 survives without collision for at least a time equal to @xmath43 , the subsequent probability to suffer a collision in a short time interval @xmath44 , and the probability density to find a molecule with that speed when selected from a random collision . </S>",
    "<S> this must then be integrated over all possible velocities . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath45 the expectation value of @xmath41 in this distribution is easily evaluated by exchanging the order of integration : the @xmath41-integral evaluates to @xmath46 and the remaining integral defines the mean speed in the gaussian distribution , @xmath47 this is identical to eq .  </S>",
