    "one of the major goals of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is to understand the hadron spectra from the non - perturbative dynamics of quarks and gluons .",
    "the method of qcd sum rules , which was originally proposed by shifman , vainshtein and zakharov  @xcite , is a useful theoretical tool for this problem and has been widely used to relate the hadron dynamics to the qcd vacuum condensates  @xcite .",
    "also , the numerical simulation based on the lattice qcd has become a powerful tool to study the hadron spectroscopy from the first principles of qcd  @xcite .    since hadrons are the low energy collective modes in the qcd vacuum , their dynamical scale is determined by the qcd scale parameter ( @xmath5 ) of the order of @xmath6 mev , or equivalently , by the qcd vacuum condensates , which are scaled by @xmath5 .",
    "for example , the @xmath7-meson mass was estimated from the chiral condensate @xmath8 on the basis of qcd sum rules approach  @xcite : @xmath9 . here , so called `` vacuum saturation ansatz '' was adopted to evaluate the vacuum expectation values of the four - quark operators . on the other hand , the introduction of @xmath5 through renormalization",
    "is closely related to the trace anomaly of qcd , namely , the gluon condensate @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it would be possible that one derives the mass formulas of hadrons written in terms of the gluon condensate , and estimates the hadron masses from the gluon condensate without factorization ansatz .    in this paper , mass formulas for the vector mesons written in terms of the gluon condensate",
    "are derived on the basis of finite energy qcd sum rules .",
    "we start with the spectral decomposition of the current correlation function , and derive the sum rules for the vector current with @xmath0 and @xmath1 weights , in which the energy - weighted spectral sums are represented by the vacuum expectation values of certain commutation relations . after evaluating the commutation relations , the sum rules with @xmath11 weights",
    "are reduced to the familiar ones obtained from the operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "a detail of derivation will be discussed in the forthcoming publication  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the sum rules with @xmath1 weights can not be derived from ope .",
    "they give new relations , in which the spectral sums are represented by qcd vacuum fluctuations . by adopting the standard pole @xmath2 continuum ansatz for the spectral function",
    ", we solve the sum rules with @xmath12 weights , and obtain the mass formulas of the vector mesons .",

    "( [ ewsr2 ] ) and  ( [ sum_even2 ] ) are in general ultraviolet ( uv ) divergent .",
    "then , we need to carry out suitable subtraction of uv divergences to obtain finite sum rules in the limit @xmath39 . this can be achieved by subtracting the continuum spectral function @xmath40 from the left - hand - side and the associated perturbative evaluation of the vacuum expectation value from the right - hand - side of eq .",
