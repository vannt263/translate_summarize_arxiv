    "in both optical media  @xcite and atomic systems , such as bose - einstein condensates ( becs )  @xcite , in the past two decades there has been a tremendous amount of effort focused on understanding the implications of periodic lattices . in the former case ,",
    "both the realms of optical waveguides  @xcite and of photorefractive crystals  @xcite have played crucial roles towards the analysis and experimental realization of states such as discrete solitons , and vortices , as well as of more complex waveforms , including ring structures , necklaces , gap solitons and many others . in atomic becs ,",
    "on the other hand , the emphasis has not only been on corresponding matter waves  @xcite , but also on quantum phenomena beyond the realm of mean - field models  @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", the emphasis has somewhat shifted from the consideration of the more customary square lattices to the examination of lattices of hexagonal or honeycomb form . there , a source of emphasis has again been localization and self - trapping in the form of solitonic and vortical structures  @xcite , but also other aspects have been studied including , e.g. , bloch states  @xcite .",
    "a significant fraction of the focus has been on the emulation by these optical systems of `` photonic graphene '' , leading to numerous remarkable features , including the creation , destruction and experimental observation of topologically protected , so - called , edge states  @xcite , and also the emergence of pseudospin and angular momentum  @xcite . in the atomic realm too , considerably tunable and flexible optical lattices of both a hexagonal and honeycomb form have been produced for single  @xcite and multi - species  @xcite experiments .",
    "while much of the interest in this context lies within quantum mechanical transitions , such as the superfluid - insulator transition  @xcite , the atoms can , very controllably , be considered in the superfluid regime where a mean - field description paralleling the optical one is suitable . as an aside",
    ", it is relevant to mention that more complex lattice structures including e.g. kagom lattices are also a subject of ongoing consideration  @xcite and are within the realm of experimental possibility in both settings .    at the mathematical level",
    ", there exists a prototypical model that combines the suitable lattice geometry , the discreteness and the nonlinearity . as a result",
    ", it captures the principal features of the experimental observations , at least as regards the emerging coherent structures .",
    "this model is the so - called discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation , which has been a subject of intense theoretical and numerical investigation  @xcite .",
    "our aim in the present work is to utilize this dnls model in order to capture the impact of anisotropy on the hexagonal and honeycomb lattices .",
    "this is in part motivated by the studies in optical photorefractive systems such as the work of  @xcite where both unstretched and stretched lattices were used and in both cases the coupling was anisotropic ( varying in one direction between @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the coupling in the other directions ) .",
    "such a systematic study is also motivated by the atomic realm of , e.g. ,  @xcite , where the full control of the optical beam intensities , wavenumbers and phases that create the lattice trapping the atoms can straightforwardly be used to produce different types of lattices ( e.g. both hexagonal and honeycomb ) and different anisotropies .    our aim here is to provide a systematic analysis of the different types of solutions that are possible in the anisotropic system .",
    "starting from the isotropic two - dimensional limit , we vary the strength of the interaction along a particular direction . progressively this leads from a two - dimensional configuration , e.g. in the honeycomb case , to an uncoupled set of quasi - one - dimensional configurations . as a result",
    ", we can appreciate that numerous states among those that exist in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) setting should disappear at a suitable critical point as we approach the 1d regime .",
    "for instance , the discrete vortices belong to this category , as there are no solutions with nontrivial vorticity in one - dimensional dnls lattices  @xcite . here",
    ", we intend to provide a quantification of the relevant solutions , as well as to provide a road map for their dynamical destabilization by evaluating their dominant linearization eigenvalues .",
    "both of these steps are performed analytically ( to leading order ) permitting a complete characterization of the bifurcation events / destabilization or disappearance of different branches of solutions .",
    "this is done for the prototypical unit cell of each lattice i.e. , for a triangular cell within the hexagonal lattice and a hexagonal cell within the honeycomb lattice , although it can be straightforwardly generalized to other cases . once the existence , stability and bifurcations of the relevant solutions are determined , then their potential instabilities ( and spectral properties ) are also explored numerically .",
    "finally , these findings are corroborated by direct numerical computations illustrating the tendency of the ( unstable ) dynamics towards ( typically ) fewer sites than the original structure . in the case of the 3-site cell in the hexagonal lattice",
    ", we observe a tendency of the dynamics towards the ground ( single - site ) state of the model for stronger couplings , or towards robust breathing excitations in the case of weaker couplings . in the case of the 6-site cell of the honeycomb lattice , even for stronger couplings , multi - site excitations ( of different types",
    " see details below ) were typically found to persist over the evolution scales of dynamical propagation considered here .",
    "our presentation is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present our systematic analytical findings regarding the existence and stability of solutions for each of the lattices in their respective unit cells . then in section iii",
    ", we present the corresponding numerical findings , as well as examine , the fate of dynamically unstable solutions .",
    "finally , in section iv , we summarize our results and present some challenges for future studies .",
    "to study the two geometries of interest , we consider the following discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation    @xmath2    with the two - dimensional anisotropic discrete laplacian @xmath3 here , the constant @xmath4 denotes the strength of the linear coupling between nearest neighbor sites in the isotropic case and the anisotropy is controlled by the parameter @xmath5 @xmath6 . since both of the grids of interest are rotationally invariant , hence there is a freedom in selecting the direction of the anisotropy .",
    "a value of @xmath7 yields the isotropic lattice with a uniform nearest neighbor coupling of @xmath4 , whereas @xmath8 completely decouples sites in the direction parallel to a particular lattice direction , chosen without loss of generality .",
    "physically , the field @xmath9 represents ( in our optical example ) the envelope of the electric field in the waveguide , while in that case @xmath10 is the propagation coordinate . for becs",
    ", the field represents the atomic wavefunction in the corresponding well of the optical lattice , while @xmath10 in that realization is replaced by the time @xmath11 .",
    "the summations are over disjoint subsets , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , of the set @xmath14 of nearest neighbors where @xmath15 for the hexagonal lattice and @xmath16 for the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the set @xmath13 is the set of nearest neighbors joined to @xmath9 by the ( anisotropic ) coupling , @xmath17 , while the remaining nearest neighbors belong to the set @xmath12 and have a coupling of @xmath4 to @xmath9 .",
    "note that in the case @xmath8 , the hexagonal grid becomes the usual rectangular grid , while the honeycomb grid becomes a parallel set of one - dimensional grids with ( in both geometries ) a nearest neighbor coupling of @xmath4 .",
    "we are interested in stationary solutions of the form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the propagation constant in optics or the chemical potential in becs .",
    "then , @xmath20 satisfies the steady - state equation @xmath21 in the anticontinuum ( ac ) limit of uncoupled sites  @xcite , ( i.e. when @xmath22 ) , the solutions of eq .   are @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "thus , at the ac limit , explicit solutions of the form @xmath25 can be found over contours @xmath26 of the uncoupled lattice points for arbitrary @xmath27 , where the nodes are indexed by @xmath28 .",
    "for the current work , in the hexagonal lattice , @xmath28 will index the sites along a three - site one - dimensional closed contour ( @xmath29 ) , while in the honeycomb lattice , @xmath28 will index the sites along a six - site one - dimensional closed contour ( @xmath30 ) , i.e. , we will consider the principal cells of the respective lattices . without loss of generality , we set @xmath31 .    following an analysis similar to that of  @xcite , we then find that the necessary ( leading order ) conditions for solutions over a discrete contour to persist for @xmath32 are given by @xmath33 where we have the periodic condition @xmath34 for @xmath35 , and the coefficients @xmath36 and @xmath37 , provide the lattice anisotropy as defined by :    @xmath38    we will study the behavior of some solutions of the variety described above in both the hexagonal and honeycomb lattices when the  background \" coupling , @xmath4 , is fixed at a small value and the anisotropy is switched on ( i.e. @xmath39 .",
    "we will see that the anisotropy may stabilize or destabilize some solutions via , typically , pitchfork ( i.e. , symmetry breaking ) bifurcations .",
    "theoretically we will find that in the weak coupling limit , this transition from stability to instability , or vice - versa , occurs when the solution collides with another solution at @xmath40 which then persists as the lattice becomes more anisotropic , until there is a complete decoupling in the prescribed direction .",
    "again , adapting the results of  @xcite ( see also the exposition of  @xcite ) , the stability of lattice excitations can be determined ( to leading order ) from the eigenvalues @xmath41 of the @xmath42 jacobian matrix of the form @xmath43 when the excited nodes in the lattice are adjacent , the ( near zero ) stability eigenvalues @xmath44 of the full problem are given by @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "we now examine some explicit examples of this general theoretical formulation of the anisotropic dnls problem .      in this subsection",
    ", we will analytically track the effects of anisotropy on the stability of various three - site configurations in the hexagonal lattice and make predictions about what the original configurations in the isotropic lattice transform into .",
    "the notation @xmath46 $ ] is employed to describe the three - site contour with phases @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 at the nodes ( while a corresponding notation will be used for six - site contours ) .",
    "the contours we discuss here are : ( 1 ) @xmath50 $ ] ( charge one vortex ) , ( 2 ) @xmath51 $ ] , and ( 3 ) @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "these are the principal ( up to trivial transformations of phase ) 3-site solutions of the hexagonal lattice cell .",
    "\\(1 ) we begin with the three - site single charged vortex ( @xmath53 ) . from eq .   with @xmath29 and with the anisotropy lying between the sites with phases @xmath54 and @xmath55",
    ", we obtain the following relationship between the phases : @xmath56 using this phase profile in eq .  , the jacobian matrix becomes @xmath57 thus , for @xmath58 the eigenvalues @xmath41 are found to be @xmath59 , @xmath60 and , @xmath61 . in particular , for the hexagonal three - site charge - one vortex ( which satifies eq .  ) the stability eigenvalues for @xmath58 are found to be @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "for this range of values of @xmath5 , all of the quantities in the radicals within the eigenvalue pairs remain nonnegative and , for sufficiently small @xmath4 , the pair @xmath65 will not collide with the continuous spectrum .",
    "hence , this vortex remains stable throughout this interval of anisotropy .",
    "note that the only eigenvalue pair that moves along the imaginary axis towards the origin of the spectral plane and thus has the potential to bring about instability when @xmath66 is @xmath63 . as the above solution of eq",
    "can not be continued below @xmath67 , additional analysis is needed to reveal the outcome for a further increase in anisotropy , i.e. for @xmath66 .    from eq .",
    ", we can also determine the theoretical predictions for the changes in the relative phases ( mod @xmath68 ) as a function of @xmath5 for @xmath58 : latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    \\label{eq:3siterelphase }    in the isotropic case ( i.e. when @xmath7 ) for all the relative phases we have @xmath70 .",
    "as the anisotropy increases , reaching @xmath71 , we find that @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "thus , at this critical point , the single - charge vortex @xmath75 $ ] , merges with the configuration @xmath76 = [ \\theta_1 , \\theta_1+\\pi , \\theta_1 ] ( \\text{mod}~ 2\\pi)$ ] i.e. , with the @xmath51 $ ] state . exploring the latter state and its stability for @xmath77 ( or , in fact , for any @xmath5 since the solution persists @xmath78 ) ,",
    "the corresponding jacobian of eq .   assumes the form @xmath79 the associated stability eigenvalues become @xmath62 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "of particular note is the eigenvalue pair @xmath65 which remains imaginary for @xmath82 .",
    "thus , this solution is stable for @xmath77 , but it destabilizes through a pitchfork bifurcation , giving rise to the discrete vortex ( inheriting its stability ) for @xmath83 .",
    "( 2 ) given our analysis of the @xmath51 $ ] state above in connection with the vortex bifurcation , we will not discuss further here the case with anisotropy between sites with phase @xmath84 . for the @xmath51 $ ] state with anisotropy between the site with phase @xmath85 and one of the @xmath84 phase sites , the jacobian matrix is @xmath86 from which we find the stability eigenvalues to be @xmath62 and @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "the eigenvalue pair @xmath89 remains real valued throughout the change of @xmath5 and thus we see that this solution remains unstable .",
    "( 3 ) in the isotropic lattice the stability eigenvalues of the hexagonal @xmath52 $ ] configuration are found to be @xmath62 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .",
    "not surprisingly , due to the adjacent in - phase sites , this is unstable . in the case of @xmath92 ,",
    "this instability persists . from our above analysis",
    ", the relevant eigenvalues can be directly found to be @xmath62 , @xmath90 , and @xmath93 . despite the significant dependence of @xmath89 on @xmath5",
    ", we see that this configuration is indeed generically expected to be unstable .",
    "we now analytically examine the stability and transformation of solutions in the anisotropic honeycomb lattice and its six - site cell ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "similar to what was done for the hexagonal lattice , we will deduce relationships between the phases for a few prototypical configurations in the honeycomb lattice . in each solution",
    ", the anisotropy lies between the sites with phases @xmath55 and @xmath94 and also between sites with phases @xmath95 and @xmath54 .",
    "the structures we will present here assume the following form in the isotropic limit of @xmath96 : ( 1 ) @xmath97 $ ] ( charge 1 vortex ) , ( 2 ) @xmath98 $ ] ( charge 2 vortex ) , ( 3 ) @xmath99 $ ] ( 4 ) @xmath100 $ ] .",
    "while additional configurations are possible here ( in particular all combinations of @xmath84 and @xmath85 phase are possible within the 6 sites ) , these configurations are the most interesting ones and will provide a basic understanding of the stability properties of the anisotropic system .",
    "\\(1 ) the honeycomb six - site charge 1 vortex ( @xmath101 ) satisfies the following phase relationships which can be deduced from eq . :",
    "@xmath102 using these results with the jacobian matrix of eq .",
    ", we find that the stability eigenvalues of the charge @xmath103 vortex are @xmath62 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and + @xmath107 where @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "it is clear that at least the eigenvalue pairs @xmath110 , @xmath89 , and @xmath65 all remain real - valued as @xmath71 and hence the charge 1 vortex is unstable on the entire interval @xmath58 .    the changes in the relative phases ( mod @xmath68 ) as a function of @xmath5 for @xmath58 are given by : latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }        in the isotropic case ( @xmath96 ) , all the relative phases satisfy @xmath112 .",
    "but as @xmath71 , we find that @xmath113 for @xmath114 , while @xmath115 and , @xmath116 . also as @xmath71 , from eq .",
    "we theoretically predict that the charge 1 vortex in the isotropic lattice merges at with @xmath117 $ ] at @xmath40 .",
    "as was shown in more detail with the hexagonal three - site charge @xmath103 vortex , the stability eigenvalues for the interval @xmath77 can be obtained and appear more simply as @xmath62 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 and , @xmath121 .",
    "thus , we have instability throughout the change in the anisotropy .",
    "more generally , the established `` rule of thumb '' for self - focusing nonlinearities is that whenever sites of the same phase are adjacent to each other , the configuration will inherit an instability associated with a real eigenvalue pair .",
    "hence , it is natural to expect , based on the structural form of the configuration @xmath122 $ ] , that it will be unstable for all values of @xmath5 .",
    "nevertheless , one of its real pairs for @xmath123 will become imaginary for @xmath83 , giving rise to an unstable daughter state , namely the single charge vortex solution .",

    "given the presence of real eigenvalues , this configuration is unstable .",
    "similarly to what we saw previously for the 3-site configuration in the hexagonal lattice , the presence of adjacent in - phase sites is detrimental to the stability of this configuration for arbitrary values of @xmath5 .",
    "hence , no stabilization of the relevant state is anticipated , independently of the particular value of the anisotropy parameter @xmath5 .",
    "in this section we present our numerical findings for the various configurations in the hexagonal and honeycomb lattices and compare these results with the theoretical findings from the previous section . in all cases , we use a newton - raphson fixed point iteration to identify the full numerical solution over the two - dimensional lattices .",
    "this process is initiated at the ac limit and continued to a small coupling while maintaining @xmath7 to yield the isotropic case . in most of the examples we consider ,",
    "the newton - raphson interation is continued to @xmath152 , but a few cases will also be examined where the fixed point iteration is continued to a higher value of @xmath4 .",
    "the anisotropy ( as described in a previous section ) is introduced by letting @xmath5 deviate from the isotropic unity value and performing a continuation in decreasing values of the parameter towards @xmath153 .",
    "we present figures that show each configuration , along with its phase portrait and spectral plane at some @xmath5 before and after the relevant bifurcation points , comparing the latter with our theoretical predictions .",

    "it is evident that the configuration has changed its character into a @xmath51 $ ] configuration , as theoretically predicted .",
    "the relative phase and eigenvalue predictions of the bottom row indeed confirm that the pitchfork bifurcation takes place at @xmath67 and leads to a collision with the configuration @xmath163 $ ] at @xmath67 ( which as theoretically predicted has the form @xmath164 $ ] , i.e. , up to a trivial phase is a @xmath51 $ ] configuration ) .",
    "we note in passing that we have also examined the relevant continuation and bifurcation for other values of @xmath4 ( such as @xmath165 ) , finding similar qualitative results ( although quantitative details , such as the critical value of @xmath5 do change ) .",

    "this solution is unstable .",

    "in summary , in the present work , we have explored the existence , stability and dynamics of localized states ( focusing on multi - site solitonic and vortex states ) in hexagonal and honeycomb lattices .",
    "we considered the prototypical unit cells in each case , namely a 3-site one in the hexagonal case and a 6-site one in the honeycomb case .",
    "analytical considerations in the vicinity of the anti - continuum limit permitted us to identify the states in the presence of anisotropy in an approximate analytical form and gave us the ability to consider the linear ( spectral ) stability eigenvalues and obtain approximate analytical expressions for them .",
    "these results allowed us to elucidate the pitchfork bifurcations that lead to the disappearance of states such as vortices ( and the destabilization of other solitonic states ) as the path from more effectively one - dimensional to effectively two - dimensional configurations is traversed .",
    "these existence and stability findings were also found to be in good agreement with detailed numerical continuations ( over the anisotropy parameter ) , at least for small values of the coupling .",
    "finally , the dynamics of the relevant structures were examined , allowing us to identify some gross features , including the breathing nature of the instability for very weak @xmath4 and the potential for stronger localization ( typically to a smaller number of sites ) ensuing as a result of instability for stronger @xmath4 .",
    "a significant number of possibilities emerge from the present work for future explorations . on the one hand",
    ", it would be relevant and interesting to examine in more detail the dynamical evolution scenarios of the model , and to provide a more systematic characterization of the propagation outcomes for cases of both weaker and stronger coupling .",
    "on the other hand , extending similar studies to the case of kagom lattices and their flat bands , identifying the spectral properties not only of the solitons / vortices  @xcite but also of the compactly supported structures  @xcite identified therein would be a timely theme .",
    "finally , extending such considerations to three - dimensional lattices of different types would also pose significant new challenges and can be expected to feature intriguing bifurcation phenomena and states of interest .",
