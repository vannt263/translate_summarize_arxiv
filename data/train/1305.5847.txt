    "when hubble ( 1926 , 1936 ) introduced his classification scheme of galaxies , he emphasized that the turning - fork diagram he obtained , depicted the systematic variation of the morphological characteristics , and the terms  early type \" and  late type \" referred only to the relative position of a galaxy in this empirical sequence .",
    "the sequence did not imply temporal evolution connections .",
    "some modifications have been introduced to this scheme over the years ( de vaucouleurs 1959 ; sandage 1961 ) . in the case of isolated galaxies ,",
    "astronomers keep searching in this well - ordered sequence of galaxy types for a clue to possible formation and evolutionary processes to explain galactic morphology .",
    "it is not surprising then , that morphology is frequently an underlying theme in the study of galaxies .",
    "a few percent of all galaxies are unclassifiable , many of these due to their unusual morphology produced by their interacting nature .",
    "in this paper we focus on intrinsic dynamical processes of galaxies , this refers to relatively isolated galaxies .",
    "spiral galaxies are classified in the hubble sequence based mainly on two criteria : the pitch angle and the bulge to disk luminosity ratio .",
    "on sandage s classification ( sandage 1975 ) , three parameters to classify spiral galaxies are employed : the bulge to disk ratio , the pitch angle of the spiral arms , and the arms fragmentation into stars .",
    "these two classifications are very similar .",
    "then , early type spirals show small pitch angles with smooth structure and conspicuous central bulges . for late spirals ,",
    "the arms are open and flocculent , and the central bulges are smaller .",
    "finally , sb galaxies are between the above two types .",
    "since the hubble classification was introduced , astronomers are puzzled and searching correlations or dependences between galactic parameters and morphological types .",
    "holmberg ( 1958 ) and srsic ( 1987 ) , compiled and analyzed photometric data ( integrated magnitudes , colors and diameters ) for hundreds of galaxies , and found a correlation between the hubble type and galaxy colors .",
    "the mass ratio @xmath7 decreases with type from sa to sd ( sage 1993 ; roberts & haynes 1994 ) .",
    "the total mass decreased as the hubble type varied from sa to sc ( pimi & maupom 1978 ; maupom , pimi & aguilar 1981 ; roberts & haynes 1994 ) .",
    "another interesting correlation is found in the maximum value of rotation velocity : values for sa galaxies are higher than sc galaxies ( rubin et al .",
    "1985 ; sandage 2000 ; sofue & rubin 2001 ) ; although , the maximum rotation velocity presents a large scatter . along the hubble sequence ,",
    "spiral galaxies disks tend to be thinner ( ma 2002 ) .",
    "some correlations are also found with the pitch angle , like the one related with the central supermassive black hole in spiral galaxies whose mass seems to decrease with the pitch angle ( seigar et al .",
    "2008 ; shields et al .",
    "2010 ) ; spiral galaxies with higher rotational velocity also have tighter spirals ( kennicutt 1981 ; savchenko & reshetnikov 2011 ) ; in the same manner , it seems that for disks with lower surface densities and lower total mass - luminosity ratios , pitch angles tend to be larger ( ma 2002 ) .",
    "regarding specifically to spiral arms morphology , studies of this type in galaxies , started earlier than the hubble classification .",
    "von der pahlen ( 1911 ) , groot ( 1925 ) , danver ( 1942 ) , and kennicutt ( 1981 ) found that spiral arms in galaxies are well fitted with logarithmic helices .",
    "kennicutt ( 1981 ) concluded that the pitch angle in early type galaxies tends to be smaller than in late type galaxies , but there is a large scatter in the pitch angle within each morphological type , concluding that the ideal hubble classification is not closely followed by real galaxies ( kennicutt 1981 ; ma 2000 ; davis 2012 ) .    in the lin & shu ( 1964 ) spiral density wave theory , galactic spiral arms",
    "are modeled as a periodic perturbation to the axisymmetric background disk s potential .",
    "this is known as the tight - winding approximation ( twa ) for small pitch angles , or wkb approximation ( wentzel - kramers - brillouin approximation of quantum mechanics -binney & tremaine 1994 ) .",
    "the solution for bisymmetric spiral arms provided by the twa takes the form ,    @xmath8 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the function @xmath9 is the amplitude of the perturbation , and @xmath10 represents the geometry of the spiral pattern . the amplitude function @xmath9 given by contopoulos & grosbl ( 1986 ) and @xmath10 of the form presented by roberts , huntley & van albada ( 1979 )",
    "are commonly used .",
    "most orbital studies in spiral galaxies theory , have employed a spiral potential of the form in equation [ cosine ] . however , the majority of disk galaxies possesses strong spiral structures , making clear that this large scale structure is an important non - axisymmetric component of galaxies that deserves an effort to model it beyond a simple perturbing term . in this work",
    "we have chosen a more physically and observationally motivated model of the spiral arms for disk galaxies , the one called perlas from pichardo ( 2003 ) , based on a three - dimensional model mass distribution , which allows a more detailed representation of spiral arms .",
    "concerning to large scale structures in galaxies , these seem to be related mainly to ordered orbital behavior ( patsis 2008 ) .",
    "this is the case for example , of grand design galaxies , where non - axisymmetric structures are composed by material librating around the family of periodic orbits known as x@xmath11 ( contopoulos 2002 ) . in spiral arms ,",
    "where the x@xmath11 periodic orbits dominate , the flow of material through the arms can be described as a  precessing ellipses \" flow .",
    "this is supported by many observational and theoretical studies ( patsis , contopoulos & grosbl 1991 ) .",
    "spiral galaxies , with their thin disks and smooth spiral arms may seem to be dominated by ordered motion , but deeper orbital studies show that chaos may be significant in spiral galaxies ( contopoulos 1983,1995 ; contopoulos 1987 ; grosbl 2003 ; voglis , stauropoulos & kalaptharakos 2006 ; contopoulos & patsis 2008 ; patsis 2009 ) , and that chaotic orbits surrounding stable periodic orbits could also support the spiral arms .",
    "however , spiral arms and bars , for example , are not expected to originate out of only chaotic orbits .",
    "patsis & kalapotharakos ( 2011 ) call _ ordered _ spirals those that have as building block a set of stable periodic orbits ; on the other hand , they call _ chaotic _ spirals those that they believe are constituted mainly from stars in chaotic motion .    currently , discussion about the nature of spiral arms as a long - lasting or transient structure is ongoing in the field .",
    "theoretical studies have demonstrated that spiral arms might be rather transient structures ( goldreich & lynden - bell 1965 ; julian & toomre 1966 ; sellwood & carlberg 1984 ; foyle 2011 ; sellwood 2011 ; prez - villegas 2012 ; fujii & baba 2012 ; kawata 2012 ) .",
    "however , if spiral arms are smooth , weak and/or with small pitch angles , the spiral structure could be long - lasting ( prez - villegas 2012 , that study is referred to late type spirals ) .    in a previous paper ( prez - villegas 2012 )",
    ", we found two clear limits for the pitch angle in late ( sc ) spiral galaxies , one that sets a maximum limit for which steady spiral arms are plausible ( based on periodic orbital studies ) , beyond which , a transient nature for the arms is proposed ; the second limit is for which spiral arms are so opened that orbital chaos dominates completely . in this second paper , we extend our studies to early ( sa ) and intermedium ( sb ) galaxies to see if these limits found in late spirals are also followed by the rest of spirals in the hubble sequence and if the values of those limits match with observations .",
    "we isolate the effect of the pitch angle , that represents the least restricted parameter ( i.e. the one with more spread values going from 4@xmath0 to 50@xmath0 ) , and for that reason the one with likely more effect on the stellar dynamics .",
    "we employ for this purpose , realistic values for the rest of the parameters that identify approximately typical sa , sb and sc galaxies .",
    "the rest of the structural parameters such as angular speed , perturbation strength ( spiral arms mass ) , etc .",
    ", are better restricted in the sense that the ranges for those values are tighter , measured both by observations and/or by self - consistent models .",
    "specific calculations regarding these parameters ( angular speed , spiral arms strength , and axisymmetric components ) will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . the galactic potential and methodology",
    "are described in section [ model ] .",
    "our results : two pitch angle restrictions in galaxies , the first based on ordered orbital behavior , and the second based on chaotic behavior , are presented in section [ results ] .",
    "finally , we present a discussion and our conclusions in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "we have constructed a family of models for the potential of normal spiral galaxies ( sa , sb and sc ) , as classified by hubble ( 1926 ) , and also based on recent observational parameters taken from the literature . for this purpose we solved numerically the equations of motion for stars in an axisymmetric potential plus a spiral arm potential . the main methods to study stellar dynamics that we use in this work are periodic orbital analysis and poincar diagrams .",
    "the most common method to model spiral arms is a two - dimensional bisymmetric local potential approximated by a cosine function ( based on the solution for the twa ) .",
    "it assumes that spiral arms are smooth , self - consistent perturbations to the axisymmetric potential . in this regime , self - consistency",
    "can not be assured if a little larger pitch angles and/or slightly larger amplitudes to the spiral arms than the ones assumed for the twa , are imposed .    to model typical spiral arms in galaxies ( i.e. pitch angles larger than about 6@xmath0 , or mass of the spiral arms larger than 1@xmath12 of the disk mass )",
    ", one goes readily far away from the twa self - consistency limits .",
    "spiral arms in real galaxies , are complicated three - dimensional gigantic structures , far intricate to be approximated with a function as simple as a cosine",
    ". to test self - consistency in these type of potentials , we analyzed ordered and chaotic orbital behavior and specifically the construction of periodic orbits . between a cosine potential and a potential based on mass distribution , the differences are not negligible at all , specially , when we are dealing with chaos .    to this purpose",
    ", we employ the spiral arms potential called perlas from pichardo ( 2003 ) , this potential is formed by individual potentials of oblate inhomogeneous spheroids lying along the logarithmic spiral locus given by roberts , huntley , & van albada ( 1979 ) ,    @xmath13 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath14 the pitch angle .",
    "@xmath15 marks the galactocentric position where the spiral arms begin , and @xmath16 is a constant that gives the shape to the starting region of the spiral arms ( we set it to 100 ; for details see pichardo 2003 ) .",
    "this bisymmetric self - gravitating potential is more realistic since it is based on a three - dimensional density distribution , providing a much more complicated function for the gravitational potential , unlike a two - dimensional local arm like the cosine potential .",
    "perlas is observationally motivated ; comparison with other theoretical models have been already published ( pichardo 2003 ; martos 2004 ; antoja 2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "we have tested approximately the self - consistency of the model , through the reinforcement by the stellar orbits ( patsis 1991 ; pichardo 2003 ) .",
    "parameters used to fit normal spiral galaxies ( sa , sb and sc ) , with references are presented in table [ tab : parameters ] . the spiral arms potential is superimposed on an axisymmetric background , described by a massive halo ( allen & santilln 1991 ) , and a miyamoto - nagai ( 1975 ) disk and bulge .",
    "we fitted the rotation curve based on observational data from literature of the masses of the disk and bulge @xmath17 disk mass ( depending on morphological type ) . with this information , we derived a halo mass using a typical maximum velocity in the rotation curve for each type . in figure",
    "[ rotation_curve ] , we show the resulting rotation curves .        theoretical studies of orbital self - consistency in normal spiral galaxies show that weak spiral arms end at corotation and strong spiral arms end at the 4/1 resonance ( contopoulos & grosbl 1986 , 1988 ; patsis , contopoulos & grosbl 1991 ) .",
    "then , the spiral arms limits depend on the position of the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) , for the inner part , and corotation for the outer part of the spirals ( in our models we place the spiral arms between these two resonances )",
    ". consequently , the angular speed of the spiral arms , @xmath18 , sets the corresponding value of the beginning and the end of these arms .",
    "measuring spiral arms angular velocities observationally is not an easy task . we know however that on average , earlier type galaxies tend to be more massive , therefore sa galaxies rotate faster than sc galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , considering the few observational studies of angular speeds from literature , these speeds seem to present a small range of difference from sa to sc , ranging between 35 and 15 @xmath19 .",
    "we employed for the axisymmetric models mass average values for the different components . with a clockwise rotation for the disk , we assume an angular velocity of @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , for the spiral arms in sa , sb , and sc galaxies , respectively ( see table [ tab : parameters ] for references ) . in figure [ resonance ]",
    "we show resonance diagrams for our galactic models .",
    "we take a fairly good approximation to the spiral arms mass , of 3% of the total disk mass ( pichardo 2003 ) , independently of the hubble type .",
    "additionally , to assure the spiral mass we fixed to our models is within observational limits , we have employed the parameter @xmath22 ( combes & sanders 1981 ) .",
    "this parameter has been implemented in studies of bars and spiral arms ( buta & block 2001 ; laurikainen & salo 2002 ; buta 2004 ; laurikainen 2004 ; block 2004 ; vorobyov 2006 ; kalapotharakos 2010 ) to measure the strength of large scale non - axisymmetric structures in galaxies .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 is defined as    @xmath23    where f@xmath24 = @xmath25 , represents the maximum amplitude of the tangential force at radius r , and @xmath26f@xmath27(r)@xmath28 , is the mean axisymmetric radial force at the same radius , derived from the @xmath29 fourier component of the gravitational potential . in figure [ qt ] we show an example of the behavior of the parameter @xmath30 given by equation [ q_max ] , for an sa ( solid line ) , sb ( dotted line ) and sc ( dashed line ) galaxies . in these three cases we have set the pitch angles to their maximum values permitted before chaos destroys all the periodic orbits support ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , for sa , sb , and sc galaxies , respectively ) .",
    "note how even for cases with high pitch angles , the parameter @xmath30 keeps always lower than the observed maximum values in galaxies ( buta 2005 ) . in figure [ parameterq ] we present the maximum value of the parameter @xmath22 for each type of galaxy as we increase the pitch angle from 0@xmath34 to 90@xmath34 .",

    "periodic orbits support large - scale structures , such as bars and spiral arms , they are known as the `` dynamic backbone '' of potentials .",

    "when the method finds a root , we obtain a periodic orbit .      to calculate the density response to a spiral potential",
    ", we employ the method of contopoulos & grosbl ( 1986 ) , that quantifies the support with periodic orbits to the arms .",
    "the method assumes that stars in circular orbits in an axisymmetric potential , rotating in the same direction of the spiral perturbation , will be trapped around the corresponding periodic orbit in the presence of the spiral arms . to this purpose",
    ", we computed a large set of periodic orbits and calculated the density response along their extension using the conservation of mass flux between any two successive orbits . with this information we search the position of the density response maxima along each periodic orbit .",

    "they present two regions , each one containing 50 orbits with 300 points each ( corresponding to the number of periods ) , with a given prograde or retrograde sense of rotation , defined in the galactic non - inertial frame . in our models , the spiral patterns move in the clockwise sense .",

    "resonances are more widely separated than in the progade resonances case , which may explain why the onset and well developed chaos takes place in the prograde region first ( and in general , only ) .",

    "we found two important restrictions to the pitch angle .",
    "the first restriction is based on the orbital ordered behavior . with the study of periodic orbits and density response",
    ", we found that there is an abrupt limit for the density response at approximately 15@xmath0 for sa galaxies , 18@xmath0 for sb galaxies and 20@xmath0 for sc galaxies .",
    "this limit denotes the end of orbital support of the density response to the imposed spiral arm potential . in cases , where the spiral arms potential is followed by their density response produced by periodic orbital crowding ,",
    "the spiral arms are more stable and could be explained better as a long - lasting feature . beyond these limits ,",
    "the density response produces systematically smaller pitch angles than the imposed spiral arms .",
    "galaxies with spiral arms beyond these limits would rather be explained as transient features .",
    "we found a second restriction , this time based on chaotic orbital behavior . in this case",
    ", we find a limit for the very same existence of spiral arms for each morphological type : for an sa , the limit is @xmath107 , for an sb , the limit is @xmath5 , and for an sc the limit is @xmath6 , for which spiral arms are so open that chaos dominates large regions of phase space , but there exist periodic orbits supporting spiral arms . beyond these limits for each type of galaxy ,",
    "chaos becomes pervasive destroying all orbital support .    with this orbital study ,",
    "we are able to pose both a limit for steady long - lasting spiral arms , beyond which spiral arms are better explained as transient features and a limit for maximum pitch angles ( no matter their nature ) in normal spiral galaxies before the system becomes completely chaotic .    several structural and dynamical parameters may play an important role in the stellar dynamics behavior , such as the pattern speed , the strength of the spiral arms ( spiral arms mass ) , the density decay along the spiral arms , the axisymmetric components mass ratios , etc . in this paper",
    "we have isolated the effect of the pitch angle on stellar dynamics to understand at what extent we could impose restrictions to its properties in models for spiral galaxies based on order and chaos .",
    "we employ for this purpose , realistic values for the rest of the parameters that identify approximately typical sa , sb and sc galaxies . a comprehensive study for other parameters",
    "is being prepared in an forthcoming paper .",
    "we provide here preliminary results on those studies for three of the relevant parameters within the observational or theoretical values for spiral galaxies : pattern speed , spiral arms mass and density decay of the spiral arms . for the pattern speed , although the construction and radial extension of periodic orbits ( length of the spiral arms ) depends sensibly on the pattern speed , the existence of the periodic orbits supporting the spiral structure inside the corotation resonance ( or 4/1 resonance ) seems not too sensitive , within the observed ( 20 to 30 km s@xmath110 kpc@xmath110 ) limits for real spiral galaxies .",
    "this means that , within the observed limits for spiral angular speeds in galaxies , the effect on the restriction of the angular speed on whether spiral arms are transient or long lived structures seems to be much less important .",
    "the spiral to disk mass ratio , as well as the angular speed , is a very restricted quantity by observations and theory . translating the amplitudes or relative forcing , to spiral arms mass , the masses to obtain self - consistent models go upto 5 or 6% of the mass of the disk . as long as we change within these limits the spiral arms mass ,",
    "the restriction to the pitch angle for the spiral arms to be supported by periodic orbits is only slightly sensitive . regarding the density fall of the spiral arms we studied several types of both lineal decay and exponential decay .",
    "this specific parameter results of little consequence as long as the linear decay slope goes approximately similar to the average slope of the exponential fall in the first half of the spiral arms extent . in a future work",
    ", we will present a detailed stellar dynamical study with these and other parameters of spiral galaxies ."
