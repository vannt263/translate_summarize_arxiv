    "the array of the four large scale laser interferometers ( ligo  @xcite , virgo  @xcite , geo  @xcite and tama  @xcite ) represent the first generation of interferometric gravitational - wave ( gw ) detectors ( _ interferometers _ for short ) .",
    "next - generation interferometers , such as advanced ligo  @xcite , plan to use the so - called _ detuned signal - recycling _ ( sr ) technique  in which an additional mirror is placed behind the dark port of a michelson interferometer in order to modify the optical resonance structure of the interferometer : depending on the location and the reflectivity of this signal - recycling mirror , the eigenfrequency and quality factor of the optical resonance can be adjusted  @xcite . as shown theoretically by buonanno and chen  @xcite and experimentally by somiya et al .",
    "@xcite and miyakawa et al .",
    "@xcite , detuned signal - recycling makes the power inside the interferometer dependent on the motion of the mirrors , creating an _ optical spring_. with optical power as high as planned for second - generation interferometers , detuned signal - recycling interferometers",
    "are characterized by two resonances within the detection band .",
    "one resonance is optical in nature , while the other one is due to the optical spring : the eigenfrequency of the test masses can be shifted from that of the pendulum up into the detection band .",
    "the general principle underlying the optical spring effect in signal - recycling interferometers is identical to that explained by braginsky , gorodetsky and khalili  @xcite for a single detuned cavity ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which had been employed in their proposal of the _ optical bar _ detection scheme  @xcite .",
    "one concern that arises with the use of the optical spring is that it always causes instability : depending on the sign of the detuning , the optical force either brings anti - damping , or creates an anti - spring .",
    "buonanno and chen have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that one can cope with the instability by incorporating a linear feedback control which ideally would not modify the noise spectral density of the gw detector . in practice , however , the need for control inside the detection band , can cause undesirable complexity in the control system or additional classical noise .    here",
    "we propose an alternative way to suppress the instability , by injecting a second carrier field from the bright port ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig : dosmich ] ) .",
    "we shall assume these carriers have different polarizations ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , so that there is no direct coupling between the two fields ( although they both directly couple to the mirrors ) . differently from ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the second carrier does not enter the arm cavity at all , in this proposal , the second carrier resonates in the arm cavity , but is subject to different sr detuning and sr mirror reflectivity .",
    "nevertheless , similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , a homodyne detection must be performed at the dark port around each of the two carriers , with the two outputs combined with appropriate filters .",
    "the main purpose of this second carrier is to create a second optical spring that forms a stable optical spring together with the first one  even though each individual optical spring , acting alone , would be unstable .",
    "such a stable , double optical spring ( dos ) is possible at least in two ways .",
    "the first way ( _ weak stabilization _ ) relies on the observation that the ratio between the optical spring constant s real part ( strength of spring / anti - spring ) and its imaginary part ( strength of damping / anti - damping ) depends on the detuning frequency of the carrier  the detunings of the two carriers can be arranged such that the first one has a stronger spring and a weaker anti - damping , while the second one has a weaker anti - spring and a stronger damping .",
    "in this case , stabilization can be achieved with a weak second carrier , which does not modify the sensitivity of the interferometer by much .",
    "the second way ( _ annihilation _ ) requires the two carriers to have equal power and exactly opposite detunings , such that their optical springs exactly cancel each other , and the test - masses differential motion behaves as a free mass again .",
    "interestingly , this configuration gives exactly the noise spectrum that had been expected by the gw community  @xcite at the time an interferometer with detuned signal - recycling was not thoroughly studied , i.e. before refs .",
    "@xcite were published .",
    "although straightforward to understand , weak stabilization and annihilation are by no means the only possibilities .",
    "in fact , an additional benefit of the dos technique is that it increases the flexibility in shaping the noise curves : for any specific source , the noise spectrum can be optimized correspondingly over the parameter subspace of the two carriers , subject to the constraint that the resulting dynamics must be stable . in this paper",
    ", we will carry out an optimization for neutron - star - neutron - star binary inspirals  using both the current noise budget of advanced ligo and a plausible noise budget for interferometers right beyond the second generation .",
    "note that the parameters for the advanced ligo configuration as well as for the other single optical spring configuration have been obtained by using the same optimization .",
    "the dos technique can also be used for the stabilization of the optical - spring ponderomotive squeezer , which generates frequency independent squeezed vacuum below the optical spring frequency  @xcite .",
    "the stable optomechanical resonance has already been demonstrated experimentally  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec.[sec : dosgwd ] we shall motivate the stabilization process and studying the classical dynamics of the double optical spring systems . in sec.[sec : dos ] we recall the necessary basics in order to calculate the input - output relation of a dos interferometer . in sec.[sec : nsdq ] different applications of the dos are discussed and our scheme is extended to a a multi - optical - spring system . in sec.[sec : conclusion ] we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "in this section , we consider the classical dynamics of double - optical - spring stabilization . for the mechanical degrees of freedom ,",
    "we only consider the _ differential mode _",
    "@xmath0 between the interferometer s test - masses , which is sensed at the dark port by both carriers . before coupling to the light",
    ", the differential mode has an eigenfrequency of @xmath1hz ( that of the suspension system ) , and effective mass of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the mass of each individual mirror .",
    "since the pendulum frequency is far below the detection band , we will simply treat the mirrors as free masses . for a carrier with angular frequency @xmath4 that is resonant in the arms , when the mirrors are held fixed , the optical resonant frequency of the differential optical mode ( to be precise , the one that is closest to this carrier ) is given by @xmath5 , where , in terms of interferometer parameters , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are given by ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the half line width of the arm cavity ( @xmath10 the power transmissivity of the itm , @xmath11 the speed of light , and @xmath12 the arm length ) , @xmath13 is the amplitude reflectivity of the srm , and @xmath14 the detuning phase of the carrier in the sr cavity ( single trip ) . in reality , when two carriers are both resonant in the arm cavity , their detuning phases in the signal - recycling cavity must differ by    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the free spectral range of the arm cavities .",
    "this constraint must be taken into account in practical designs of dos interferometers .",
    "now with optomechanical coupling , let us first consider a single detuned carrier . treating the mirrors as free masses to start with , the classical equation of motion of the differential mode",
    "can be written in frequency domain as : @xmath17 where @xmath2 is the reduced mass , @xmath18 is any external classical force .",
    "the frequency dependent optical spring constant is given by  @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 with @xmath22 the carrier s circulating power in the arms .",
    "note that @xmath20 has units of @xmath23 .",
    "before treating a full - power interferometer , it is instructive to first draw our attention to a _ weakly coupled regime _ , assuming that optical frequency scales ( effective detuning @xmath7 and effective bandwidth @xmath6 ) are much larger than the resulting optomechanical resonant frequency . in the weakly coupled regime , one can expand the optical spring constant ( cf .",
    "e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are both real constants .",
    "analogous to a mechanical spring , @xmath25 describes the restoring force while @xmath26 denotes the damping .",
    "real and imaginary parts of the optical spring constant are proportional to @xmath20 , which is in turn proportional to the carrier power @xmath22 . inserting eq . into eq .",
    ", stability requires @xmath27 or basically positive spring constant and positive damping .    from eq .  , it is straightforward to deduce that the stability condition   can never be fulfilled by a single optical system , since a positive detuning produces always anti - damping ( @xmath28 ) while a negative detuning always comes along with an anti - restoring force ( @xmath29 ) . in fig.[fig",
    ": spring ] , for fixed circulating power and effective line width ( @xmath6 ) , as the effective detuning ( @xmath7 ) shifts from @xmath30 to @xmath31 , we plot the trajectory mapped out by @xmath32 .",
    "we use two different powers , with outer trajectory corresponding to a higher power . indeed , these @xmath31-shaped trajectories are confined within quadrants with @xmath33 . in case of a double optical spring , each individual spring , as we change its detuning frequency , has its own @xmath31-shaped trajectory .",
    "when two optical springs combine , their complex spring constants add up , which can be depicted by a vector addition in fig.[fig : spring ] . by adjusting the detunings for first and second carrier",
    "it is possible to find many stable compositions , with one of them depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : spring ] . in this configuration , a relatively strong optical spring",
    "is stabilized by a relatively weak anti - spring generated by a lower power .",
    "this is possible because the stronger optical spring is generated by a carrier with relatively high optical quality factor , @xmath34 , which tends to yield a stronger restoring ( or anti - restoring ) than damping ( or anti - damping ) , while the weak anti - spring is generated by a carrier with low optical quality factor , which tends to yield a stronger damping ( or anti - damping ) than restoring ( or anti - restoring ) .",
    "a lower optical power of the second carrier allows the damping of the second spring to match that of the first one , while makes the anti - restoring of the second spring much weaker than the restoring of the first spring .",
    "mathematically , this _ weak stabilization _ can be summarized as @xmath35    as stated before , the stability condition given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : stablecondsimp ] ) is an approximation only valid in the weakly coupled regime .",
    "a more precise statement regarding the stability of the two carrier system is given by the condition that all roots of the characteristic equation @xmath36 must have negative imaginary parts .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : stab ] , we explore high - power dos stabilization by tracing the real and imaginary parts of the optomechanical eigenfrequency , obtained numerically solving eq .. we first consider single - optical - spring configurations with power increasing from 0 to 800kw ( from left most dot to top dot ) . in this case both",
    "the real part of the optomechanical resonant frequency and the anti - damping increases .",
    "then we fix the first carrier at 800kw and increase the second carrier ( up to 8kw and 80kw , respectively , for two different choices of linewidth and detuning ) , which stabilizes the system by adding damping while only slightly decreases the optomechanical resonant frequency by a few hz ( from the top dot to the two lower - right dots ) .",
    "here we do not plot the optical resonances , which for the circulating power considered here remain stable .    before ending this section",
    ", we note that , when pendulum frequency is not neglected , there does exist a stable single optical spring regime where an increase in mechanical resonant frequency is associated with an increase in damping .",
    "but this requires that the optical frequency scales be lower than the pendulum frequency , which is not desirable in case of gw detectors .",
    "such a regime was experimentally investigated by schliesser et al .",
    "in this section , we consider the sensitivity of stable dos interferometers . since the two carrier fields are different in polarization and frequency , both fields can be measured independently and we effectively obtain two interferometers in one scheme , both sensing the same differential mode [ eq .  ] of mirror motion .",
    "the input optical vacuum fluctuations associated with the two carriers , on the other hand , are independent .    throughout this paper",
    ", we will assume that gws with amplitude @xmath37 incident from right above the detector plane , with a polarization that maximizes the response of our @xmath12-shaped michelson interferometer .",

    "it turns out that the second carrier not only helps to stabilize the interferometer but can also improve its sensitivity .",
    "we first assume both carriers to have the same sr mirror reflectivity , in this case the gain in ns - ns sensitivity is maximized when the two optical springs totally cancel each other ( fig.[fig : nsd12 ] ) at an equal power distribution in the two carrier fields .",
    "fig.[fig : nsd12 ] also shows the contribution of each carrier to the total noise spectral density .",
    "if each carrier senses a different reflectivity of the sr mirror the interferometer s sensitivity can be improved further . with this additional degree of freedom the situation of canceled optical springs",
    "is no longer the optimal choice for ns - ns binaries .",
    "each carrier can be optimized for a different frequency regime such that they complement each other .",
    "this is illustrated for an equal distribution of the total power ( @xmath70 for each carrier ) in fig.[fig : nsd22 ] where one carrier ensures good sensitivity in the low frequency regime while the other one gives the main contribution at frequencies above the optomechanical resonance as shown by the contribution curves .",
    "the noise spectral density is close to the classical noise level in low frequencies , and an improvement in event rate of 35.5% can be achieved for ns - ns binaries for which the optimization was performed . as a more general optimization",
    "is performed , allowing two carriers to have different powers summing up to 800kw , it turns out that @xmath71 achieves a slightly better event rate improvement of 36.3% .",
    "results for different power distributions are given in tab.[tab : improvement ] .",
    "the sensitivity of all optimized configurations is basically improved at low frequencies at the expense of the high frequencies .",
    "therefore it might be necessary to carry out an additional broadband optimization in order to achieve a better sensitivity in the high frequency regime .",
    "this can be accomplished by first picking out all configurations obeying an event rate which is at least a certain fraction of the optimal event rate for ns - ns binary systems ( cf .",
    "eq.([eq : snr ] ) ) . in a second step",
    "these configurations are explored in the high frequency regime by considering a smaller frequency integration interval @xmath72 $ ] and selecting the optimal signal - to - noise ratio on this interval . for the @xmath73-configuration as an example , we can achieve a sensitivity comparable to advanced ligo on the @xmath74 $ ] frequency band while maintaining an improvement in the event rate ( integrating again from @xmath75 ) of 16.4% compared to advanced ligo ( cf .",
    "fig[fig : nsd22 ] ) .    after adding up all classical noise contribution shown in figs.[fig : nsd12 ] and [ fig : nsd22 ]",
    "it turns out that the noise spectral density of the double optical spring configuration  contrary to the single optical spring in advanced ligo  almost follows the borderline set by the classical noise in the low frequency regime .",
    "let us write @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are weighted averages of classical , quantum , and total noise spectrum in the low - frequency band , respectively . for the @xmath80 configuration ( cf .",

    "qualitatively , starting with a level of @xmath82 , further lowering @xmath78 by a factor of 2 only improves @xmath83 from 0.81 to 0.88 , which yields an 14% increase in event rate .",
    "it is likely that technical improvements will reduce the classical noise floor in the future . in order to explore the potential of our proposed configuration to increase the quantum limited sensitivity by reshaping the noise curves in an optimal way",
    ", we analyze the performance for a reduced classical noise budget . for instance",
    ", the gravity gradient noise is a limiting factor at lower frequencies . as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite this effect can be removed from the recorded data by performing an independent measurement of the ground s density fluctuations near each test - mass .",
    "we assume it to be 1/10 ( in amplitude ) the current estimation for advanced ligo  @xcite .",
    "another limiting factor is given by the thermal noise in the suspension system and mirrors .",
    "we assume that the suspension thermal noise can be lowered by a factor of 10 in amplitude , while internal thermal noise of mirrors can be lowered by a factor of 3 in amplitude  @xcite .",
    "such improvements may possibly be realized by ( i ) optimizing the design of mirror coating structure and suspension wires , ( ii ) improving mechanical quality factors of mirror coating , substrate and suspension materials , and ( iii ) applying cryogenic techniques  @xcite .",
    "now we optimize the usual single optical spring configuration as well as our proposed double optical spring layout for this modified noise budget .    only now",
    "the potential of the two carrier interferometer becomes apparent : for the new classical noise budget , the single optical spring configuration can improve the event rate for ns - ns binary inspirals only by 61% .",
    "but the dos configuration can do 238% .",
    "this corresponds to an improvement in event rate of the dos compared to the optimized ( with respect to the new classical noise budget ) single optical spring configuration of 110% ( cf .",
    "tab.[tab : improvement ] ) .",
    "such a situation is presented in fig.[fig : lownoise ] .",
    "the big gap between the single optical spring total noise and the classical noise budget verifies that the single optical spring advanced ligo configuration has not been limited by classical noise at low frequencies . while this gap can be partially filled by the double optical spring configuration , there is still room for further improvement . for the configuration used in fig.[fig : lownoise ]",
    "we evaluate @xmath84 in this case , lowering the quantum noise by a factor of 2 improves the event rate by 69% .",
    "one possibility of further improvement would be to inject even more than two carriers , and combine the corresponding output channels ( cf .",
    "[ sec : mos ] ) .",
    "while the concept of a stable double optical spring ( dos ) has motivated experiments such as the one already carried out by corbitt et al .",
    "@xcite , in this paper , we have theoretically investigated the benefit of a double optical spring ( dos ) configuration for second generation gravitational - wave detectors , in particular in a follow - up experiment to advanced ligo , possibly in combination with other existing schemes , e.g. , the local readout scheme proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as the injection of squeezed vacuum  @xcite .    in the dos configuration ,",
    "a second laser beam is injected into signal - recycling interferometers at the bright port which is , as the first carrier , resonant in the arm - cavities and is also detuned in the signal - recycling cavity .",
    "the two outputs are optimally filtered and combined . by choosing appropriate detunings of the signal - recycling cavity and homodyne detection angles , it is possible to achieve a stable double optical spring while additionally improving the sensitivity .    taking into account the current classical noise budget estimation for the advanced ligo detector , as well as constraints on optical power , we have performed an optimization of our double - carrier scheme towards the detection of compact binary inspirals specifying to neutron stars .",
    "the dos allows a 36% improvement in event rate , and we have shown that further improvement in event rate will largely be limited by classical noise . when considering a more optimistic classical noise budget , dos interferometers are much more capable than single - optical - spring interferometers in taking advantage of this improvement : compared with 61% improvement in event rate achievable by single - optical - spring configurations , the dos allows 238% .",
