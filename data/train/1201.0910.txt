    "previously , we have compared the quality of fit provided by atmospheric models , high resolution synthetic spectra , and spectral energy distributions ( seds , @xmath4 ) computed both in lte , and with many opacity sources treated in self - consistent non - lte ( nlte ) , for the the sun and the standard stars procyon ( @xmath5 umi ) and arcturus ( @xmath5 boo ) ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we found that our lte models tend to increasingly predict too much blue and near - uv band flux as @xmath1 decreases , and that the problem is exacerbated by non - lte effects ( mainly the non - lte over - ionization of , as is well explained in the case of the sun ( see , for example , @xcite ) ) .",
    "however , their conclusions were weak because of the small number of stars covering a few haphazard points in stellar parameter space ( @xmath6 $ ] ) .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter paper i ) took a first step toward making the investigation more comprehensive by comparing a large grid of lte model seds spanning the cool side of the hr diagram to observed seds taken from the extensive uniformly re - calibrated spectrophotometric catalog of @xcite .",
    "they investigated lte models and synthetic seds computed with two choices of input atomic lines list : a larger , lower quality `` big '' list , and a smaller , higher quality `` small '' list , and found that the models computed with the `` small '' line list provide greater internal self - consistency among different spectral bands , and closer agreement with the less model - dependent @xmath1 scale of @xcite , but not to the interferometrically derived @xmath1 values of @xcite .",
    "they also found that to within the limits of the observed spectrophotometry , there was no evidence of a systematic over - prediction of blue and near - uv band flux among gk giants in general , but they did confirm the over - prediction for arcturus ( their `` k1.5iii-0.5 '' sample ) .    [ [ section ] ]    here we take the next step by carrying out a similar comparison for a large grid of models seds with many important extinction sources treated in self - consistent nlte ( see @xcite for a description of these atmospheric models and spectra with h , he , and two or more of the lowest ionization stages of c , n , o , and most of the light metals and the fe - group elements treated in self - consistent multi - species non - lte statistical equilibrium . )",
    "our goal is to map out the goodness of fit , and the magnitude of any systematic discrepancies between model and observed seds , as a function of the three stellar parameters , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath7 $ ] , this time for nlte models , and to compare the results to those of lte modeling .",
    "we also compare our @xmath1 values inferred from sed fitting to less model - dependent @xmath1 calibrations .",
    "one important goal is to determine where in the upper right quadrant of the hr diagram nlte effects become most important .",
    "@xcite presented a large catalog ( henceforth b85 ) of observed seds taken with photo - electric instruments on 0.5 m class telescopes at various observatories in the former ussr from the late 1960s to the mid 1980s , and uniformly photometrically re - calibrated to the `` chilean system '' .",
    "@xcite contains a more detailed description of the individual data sources included in this compilation .",
    "these data sets all generally cover the @xmath8 range 3200 to 8000    with a nominal sampling , @xmath9 , of 25  , and have a quoted `` internal photometric accuracy '' of @xmath10 . a point worth repeating from paper",
    "i is that to match the appearance of the synthetic to the observed spectra , we had to convolve the synthetic spectra with an instrumental broadening kernel corresponding to a resolution element , @xmath9 , of 75 a.    [ [ section-1 ] ]    paper i contains a description of our procedure for extracting quality - controlled samples of spectra from the b85 catalog and forming mean and @xmath11 deviation spectra for each spectral type at each @xmath7 $ ] value .",
    "we note here for the first time that our procedure effectively yields a useful spectrophotometric library for solar metallicity gk stars . to briefly summarize , the procedure involves cross - referencing the b85 catalog with the 5@xmath12 revised edition of the bright star catalog @xcite , henceforth bsc5 ) to screen out stars flagged as exhibiting binarity , chemical peculiarity , or variability of any kind .",
    "the b85 catalog does not contain metallicity information , therefore , we then identified our b85 stars in the metallicity catalog of @xcite . for many , but not all , of our stars , the @xcite contains multiple @xmath7 $ ] values . for objects where these were approximately randomly distributed",
    ", we found the mean metallicity . for objects",
    "where these had a skewed distribution , we disregarded the deviant values ( usually only one ) ) , and found a modal metallicity .",
    "we only retained stars for which the mean ( or modal ) @xmath7 $ ] value was within @xmath13 of either of our two nominal @xmath7 $ ] values of interest ( 0.0 and -0.5 ) .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    spectral and luminosity classes were finalized by cross - referencing b85 stars with the revised catalog of mk spectra types for the cooler stars @xcite , the paper of @xcite , the perkins catalog of revised mk types for the cooler stars @xcite , or @xcite , in decreasing order of preference .",
    "we also formed mean @xmath14 values for our spectral types by cross - referencing b85 stars with the catalog of homogeneous means in the ubv system @xcite .",
    "( as a result , we found the bsc5 catalog to accurately reflect the primary sources for these stars , and could have relied largely on it alone for spectral types and colors . )",
    "all spectra were corrected for their heliocentric radial velocity , _ rv _ , using the values in bsc5 .",
    "however , we expect the _ rv _ correction to have a very minor effect on the quality of spectral fitting at the low spectral resolution of the b85 data .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    in keeping with our automated approach , we make no attempt to find values in the literature ( of possibly variable quality ) for the distance and radius of each star .",
    "rather , all spectra have been interpolating to a common regular @xmath8 grid , and then a `` quasi - bolometric '' normalization was applied by dividing them by the entire area under the spectrum from 3200 to 7500  .",
    "we note that this differs from the normalization used in paper i , in which the spectra were forced to have the same flux in a narrow spectral region around 6750  .",
    "we suspect that the normalization used in paper i may artificially enhance the quality of fit at the red end of the spectrum with respect to that at the blue end , and is overly reliant on the absence of any unexpected features around 6750  . for each spectral type and @xmath7 $ ] value , we calculate mean and @xmath11 deviation spectra for the sample of corresponding individual spectra .",
    "table 1 of paper i shows how many stars of each spectral / class and @xmath7 $ ] value , and the number of spectra per star , were finally retained from the b85 catalog , along with the identities of the stars . in table",
    "[ tabb85 ] we present summary information showing the total number of observed spectra that were used to form the mean and @xmath11 deviation spectra in each spectral class/@xmath7 $ ] sample .",
    "any individual spectra that deviated by more than @xmath15 from the sample mean over a significant @xmath8 range were rejected and the mean and deviation spectra were re - calculated .",
    "this resulted in a final set of 44 spectra of 33 stars , 30 of @xmath7=0.0 $ ] and three of @xmath7=-0.5 $ ] .",

    "therefore , the evaluation of nlte and lte fits to this sample is directly comparable to the nlte modeling of arcturus of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the grid of lte spherical atmospheric models and synthetic seds computed with phoenix v. 150303c , covering @xmath16 600 parameter points , was described in detail in paper i. the most pertinent point to reiterate here is that the grid has sampling intervals , @xmath17 , of 125 k and @xmath18 of 0.5 .",

    "the radii of these spherical models were determined by holding the mass fixed at @xmath21 , and the justification is described in paper i and more extensively in the careful investigation of phoenix lte models of red giants in the `` nextgen '' grid of @xcite .",

    ". the considerations leading to this choice were discussed in paper i , but are worth reiterating here given the recent discussion surrounding solar abundances ( see , for example , @xcite )",
    ". there has been some tension between 3d nlte spectroscopic abundances and helioseismological abundances that makes it difficult to clarify which abundances to prefer .",
    "we plan to extend our investigation in the future by exploring the effects of both alternate solar abundances , and non - solar abundances for metal - poor stars .",
    "[ [ section-4 ] ]    we note again here that our models are in hydrostatic and radiative / convective equilibrium , and are static and horizontally homogeneous . therefore , they can not account for the effects of chromospheric heating , nor for star spots , active regions , granulation , or other horizontal inhomogeneities .",
    "@xcite contains a description of the method and scope of the nlte statistical equilibrium ( se ) treatment in phoenix and the sources of critical atomic data , and we only re - iterate the most pertinent aspects here .",
    "if necessary , phoenix can include at least the lowest two stages of 24 elements , including the lowest six ionization stages of the 20 most important elements , including fe and three other -group elements , in nlte se .",
    "this includes the inclusion of thousands of lines of and ii in nlte .",
    "something that we have _ not _ described in previous papers is that we construct our atomic models using an automatic procedure that constructs the models from energy - level and atomic line data in the line lists of @xcite .",
    "the only input is the energy cut - off for the highest lying levels to be included in the atomic model .",
    "this has the very important advantage that the atomic data for the nlte models is bound to be consistent with that of the lte models .",
    "the supplementary data for radiative bound - free ( @xmath26 ) and collisional cross - sections that are needed are described in @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ]    for the species treated in nlte , only levels connected by transitions of @xmath27 value greater than -3 ( designated primary transitions ) are included directly in the se rate equations .",
    "all other transitions of that species ( designated secondary transitions ) are calculated with occupation numbers set equal to the boltzmann distribution value with excitation temperature equal to the local kinetic temperature , multiplied by the ground state nlte departure co - efficient for the next higher ionization stage .",
    "we have only included in our nlte treatment here those ionization stages that are non - negligibly populated at some depth in the sun s atmosphere . as a result , we only include the first one or two ionization stages for most elements .",
    "we therefore err on the side of including _ more _ ionization stages than are necessary for the late g and k class stars being modeled presently .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ]    it is worth re - emphasizing here that our method of solving the coupled se and radiative transfer equations is such that the se solution is self - consistent across all nlte species .",
    "for example , if transitions from two or more nlte species overlap in wavelength , the se solutions of the species will be correspondingly coupled as a natural consequence of the method .",
    "this is significant for late - type stars in which the spectrum is notoriously over - blanketed in the blue and near uv bands . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have studied the effect of including or excluding various groups of transitions in the nlte se and have found that the se of the fe - group elements has a significantly greater effect on the model structure and sed that the that of the `` light metals '' .",
    "for this investigation , we make no attempt to individually `` hand - tune '' the values of atomic parameters for particular transitions as one should for careful spectroscopic abundance determination . here , we are interested in the _ differential _ effect on the atmospheric structure and overall sed of models as a result of many opacity sources being treated in nlte as compared to lte , and our hope is that errors in the many nlte transitions being treated will on average approximately cancel each other out .",
    "[ [ section-7 ] ]    we note that in nlte mode , phoenix is currently restricted to the smaller , higher quality ( `` small '' ) atomic line list discussed in paper i. therefore , the lte models used in the comparisons here are those of `` series 2 '' from paper i. this `` small '' atomic line list consists of a 1.4 gbyte list adapted from lists available on kurucz ftp site as of 2007 , _ except _ for those species treated in nlte , for which the line list transitions are suppressed . for nlte species , only those bound - bound ( @xmath28 ) transitions accounted for in the model atoms represented by the se equations are accounted for .",
    "the molecular line list is an 11 gbyte file that includes all molecular opacity sources that are important in the sun , among many other molecular opacity courses .",
    "this list was developed for phoenix modeling of brown dwarfs ( see , for example , @xcite ) and is more that adequate to account for molecular opacity in our coolest k stars .",

    "this nlte re effect has been previously found , and extensively discussed , in detailed nlte investigations of the sun s atmosphere ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and is caused almost entirely by the effect of nlte on the fe - group lines .",
    "the effect is enhanced by @xmath16 100 k near the surface in the atmospheres of the mildly metal poor giants .",
    "for stars of @xmath34 k , the effect of nlte is to _ cool _ the atmosphere at higher layers ( @xmath35 ) by as much as @xmath16 150 k. photo - ionization ( @xmath26 ) edges in the uv of ( @xmath36 ) , ( @xmath37 ) , and ( @xmath38 ) are transitions that are strong in most of the models throughout our @xmath1 range , and occur in a spectral region where there is still enough flux that they might cool the atmosphere in nlte with respect to lte .    [ [ section-10 ] ]    note that @xmath39 behaves erratically at @xmath40 because the @xmath41 structure steepens in the lower atmosphere where many radiative transitions become optically thick and the evaluation of @xmath42 becomes numerically sensitive to this slope .",

    "we note that for the case of arcturus , for which the observed spectra presumably have the best quality , the use of nlte models reduces the size of the @xmath1 discrepancy between blue and red bands from 125 to 62.5 k.

    "this deficit of absorption in the synthetic seds with respect to the observed ones is consistently present in the individual observed spectra for the g5 iii stars , spans 12 data points in the raw observed spectrum , and varies smoothly with wavelength over a range of  280  .",
    "we note that this discrepancy is either absent , or much less pronounced , in both the g4 - 5 v and g8 iii stars , so appears to be localized in both @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in paper",

    "[ fcalibgnt1 ] that the photometrically derived @xmath1 values of @xcite agree very closely with the calibration of rm05 .",
    "this is expected because @xcite and rm05 both make use of the photometric index _ versus _ @xmath1 relations of @xcite ( and papers in that series ) .",
    "our lte models match the rm05 calibration to within the precision of the grid ( @xmath91 k ) for the latest spectral classes , and increasingly predict too large a @xmath1 value , by as much as @xmath92 k as @xmath14 decreases .",
    "this seems surprising given that the later - type stars have more complicated seds that are more difficult to model , as discussed above .",
    "this may reflect of a `` conspiracy '' of canceling errors at the latest spectral classes , and the result should be approached with caution .",
    "again , we caution that the red band result for the g5 iii sample is spurious for the reasons discussed above .",
    "recently , @xcite have published a new irfm @xmath1 scale ( with i. ramirez and j. melendez as co - authors ) for stars of @xmath93 and find that the scale is warmer by  85 k than that of rm05 for stars of @xmath94 k while agreeing more closely with rm05 for cooler stars .",
    "this deviation from the rm05 scale results from a change in the absolute calibration of the photometry , therefore , it is expected to also apply to lower gravity stars .",
    "if it does , then our results may be in closer agreement with the irfm calibration across the whole range of spectral classes studied here .",
    "our lte results are in similarly close agreement to the k giant @xmath1 calibration of b10 .",
    "because our nlte @xmath1 scale is 62.5 k lower than the lte scale , the nlte models predict too low a @xmath1 value for the latest types , and a value that is closer to that of rm05 , but still to large , for the earlier types .",
    "we note that the results of b10 are based on limb - darkening derived from 1d atmospheric models , and that @xcite recently found that limb - darkening from 3d models leads to smaller derived radii and @xmath1 values that are correspondingly larger by as much as  20 k for stars of @xmath1 in the range 4600 to 5100 k ( spectral classes k0 to g5 ) and @xmath3 $ ] of -1 , and by a smaller amount for stars of @xmath3 $ ] of 0.0 .",
    "it is intriguing that the sign of the 3d correction is one that would bring the b10 results into closer agreement with our nlte @xmath1 values for the corresponding spectral classes .",
    "[ [ section-21 ] ]    we note that the @xmath1 values for individual stars derived by @xcite from the /ii balance are also generally larger than rm05 , and are in closer agreement with our values . because our method is also essentially spectroscopic rather than photometric , this might seem to be evidence for spectroscopic @xmath1 determinations being generally 50 - 100 k larger than photometric determinations .",
    "however , the photometric @xmath1 scale is dependent upon the absolute calibration adopted , and we caution against drawing a conclusion on the basis of this work .",
    "the @xmath1 values for individual stars of @xcite and @xcite for g giants show a significant scatter and our @xmath1 values lie near the upper limit of their results .",

    "our results for g dwarfs are better than those for for g giants , in that for both the g0 and g4 - 5 samples our blue band nlte @xmath1 values are just slightly warmer than the rm05 calibration , by one @xmath17 element ( 62.5 k ) . for g stars",
    ", we infer that our nlte modeling is increasingly accurate as @xmath2 increases .",
    "this may reflect that our 1d horizontally homogeneous static models become increasingly inaccurate as @xmath2 decreases .",
    "[ [ section-22 ] ]    our lte @xmath1 value for the k1.5 iii sample of @xmath7=-0.5 $ ] ( consisting entirely of arcturus spectra , recall ) provides about the same quality of match to the rm05 calibration as that of our k1 and k2 iii samples of @xmath7=0.0 $ ] . at the same time , our lte @xmath1 value for the metal poor g8 iii sample is much closer to the rm05 calibration than that of the solar metallicity g8 iii sample .",
    "the nlte blue band fit at g8 iii/@xmath7=-0.5 $ ] is very close rm05 , whereas the nlte results are cooler than rm05 by @xmath95 k at k1.5 iii/@xmath7=-0.5 $ ] .",
    "we tentatively infer that our ability to reproduce the rm05 calibration with nlte models for the earlier gk spectral classes improves with decreasing metallicity in this @xmath7 $ ] range .",
    "this is not unexpected given the decreasing dependence on the realism of the line blanketing treatment as @xmath7 $ ] decreases .",
    "our strongest conclusion is that the adoption of nlte for many opacity sources shifts the spectrophotometrically determined @xmath1 scale for giants downward by an amount , @xmath17 , in the range of about 30 to 90 k all across the mid - g to mid - k spectral class range , and across the @xmath7 $ ] range from 0.0 to -0.5 .",
    "this shift brings our spectrophotometrically derived @xmath1 scale for the solar metallicity g giants into closer agreement with the less model - dependent @xmath1 scale determined by the irfm , although our @xmath1 values for these g giants are too large in any case . for the k giants , lte and nlte models provide about the same quality of match , and are closer to the less model - dependent irfm @xmath1 values than is the case for the g giants .",
    "we find tentative evidence on the basis of two spectral classes in the g range that this nlte downward shift in the @xmath1 scale becomes smaller as luminosity class increases from iii to v.      both nlte and lte model seds show a much greater variation about the observed sed in our more heavily line blanketed `` blue '' band ( @xmath96  ) than in the red band .",
    "this probably indicates that there are inadequacies in the accuracy and completeness of the atomic line list data and in the treatment of line formation .",
    "the latter inadequacy may in part be a result of our use of static 1d models .",
    "nevertheless , we find somewhat surprising agreement in the best fit value of @xmath1 between the blue and red bands .",
    "there is marginal evidence that nlte models seem to give more consistent results between the blue and red bands for the earlier spectral classes ( g8-k0 ) of solar metallicity than for later classes . moreover , there is marginal evidence that the derived @xmath2 values are more consistent between the red and blue bands from nlte modelling than that of lte .",
    "presumably , the highest quality observed sed in library is that for the k1.5iii/@xmath7\\approx -0.5 $ ] sample , which consists of three independent measurements of the spectrum of the bright standard red giant arcturus .",
    "we find that our nlte grid provides greater consistency in derived @xmath1 value between our blue and red bands than does the lte grid .",
    "however , we find that the blue band yields a @xmath1 value that is still lower than that of the red band ( by nominally 62.5 k ) , indicating that nlte models of red giants predict too much flux in the blue band with respect to the red band .",
    "this is a recurrence of a long - standing problem with the modeling of late - type stellar seds ( see @xcite ) , and may indicate an inadequacy in the atmospheric modeling of such stars .",
    "however , we do not find strong evidence of this blue band versus red band discrepancy among our many solar metallicity sed fits , and speculate that it may be a discrepancy that worsens with decreasing metallicity .      as a by - product of this investigation",
    ", we have produced a quality - controlled stellar library of observed mean and @xmath11 seds for solar metallicity giants that well sample the range from g8 to k4 iii .",
    "we will make both the library of observed seds and the nlte ( and corresponding lte ) grid of model seds available to the community by ftp + ( http://www.ap.smu.ca/  ishort / phoenix ) .      that no model provides a good fit for many wavelength windows in the blue band suggests that a more sophisticated statistical test of goodness - of - fit , in which the contribution at each wavelength to the statistic is weighted by the ability of any model to provide a fit at that wavelength .",
    "we plan to investigate statistical tests that might enhance the signal of agreement , of lack thereof , between the red and blue bands for any model .",
    "the @xmath97 photometric system employed in large surveys such as that of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) have become increasingly important for the characterization of late - type stars ( see , for example , the exhaustive analysis of @xcite that was made public just as we were drafting this report ) .",
    "it would be useful to investigate whether synthetic colors computed from our model seds in this , and possibly other intermediate band photometric systems optimized for stellar photometry , are sensitive to nlte effects .",
    "we plan to expand our nlte grid by incorporating non - solar abundance distributions for metal poor populations ( mainly @xmath5-enhancement ) and much lower metallicities typical of the halo population .",
    "very metal poor halo giants are important tracers of the galaxy s early chemical evolution , and the effect of a _ large scale _ nlte treatment , such as that performed here , on their derived parameters and compositions has yet to be carried out .",

    "<S> we present a grid of atmospheric models and synthetic spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for late - type dwarfs and giants of solar and 1/3 solar metallicity with many opacity sources computed in self - consistent non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) , and compare them to the lte grid of @xcite ( paper i ) . </S>",
    "<S> we describe , for the first time , how the nlte treatment affects the thermal equilibrium of the atmospheric structure ( @xmath0 relation ) and the sed as a finely sampled function of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 $ ] among solar metallicity and mildly metal poor red giants . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the computed seds to the library of observed spectrophotometry described in paper i across the entire visible band , and in the blue and red regions of the spectrum separately . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for the giants of both metallicities , the nlte models yield best fit @xmath1 values that are  30 to 90 k lower than those provided by lte models , while providing greater consistency between @xmath2 values , and , for arcturus , @xmath1 values , fitted separately to the blue and red spectral regions . </S>",
    "<S> there is marginal evidence that nlte models give more consistent best fit @xmath1 values between the red and blue bands for earlier spectral classes among the solar metallicity gk giants than they do for the later classes , but no model fits the blue band spectrum well for any class . </S>",
    "<S> for the two dwarf spectral classes that we are able to study , the effect of nlte on derived parameters is less significant . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our derived @xmath1 values to several other spectroscopic and photometric @xmath1 calibrations for red giants , including one that is less model dependent based on the infrared flux method ( irfm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the nlte models provide slightly better agreement to the irfm calibration among the warmer stars in our sample , while giving approximately the same level of agreement for the cooler stars . </S>"
