    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadronic collider ( lhc ) , the biggest high energy nuclear experiments in the world , realized the creation of a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , a thermalized system consist of free quarks and gluons , which was the main matter of our early universe shortly after the big bang . in order to understand the organ of our universe and to study the non - perturbative region of quantum chromodynamics ,",
    "it is of great importance to measure the macroscopic properties of this matter , such as equation of state , transport coefficient , viscosity , phase boundary , and so on .",
    "however , direct measurement is extremely difficult because the qgp matter made - in - lab exists only shortly in violent systems , due to the confinement of quarks .",
    "in fact , those properties can only be extracted from experimental data based phenomenological models .    among those models , statistical thermal model was first proposed in 1950 s  @xcite , though there was neither the terminology of quark nor that of qgp at that time .",
    "this model is still in use today .",
    "the basic assumption is , after the creation of a fireball ( of qgp ) , all hadron species are strongly produced under the same temperature followed with weak decays and hadronic interactions .",
    "the phase transition temperature @xmath2 is one of the main parameters of the model , which can be extracted from experimental data of particle yields / ratios .",
    "the obtained temperature is about 160  mev , very close to lattice ( lqcd ) prediction@xcite .",
    "however , statistical thermal model can neither describe the dynamics evolution of the collision systems nor cover more observables than particle yields / ratios .",
    "soon laudau  @xcite proposed hydrodynamical model , which made one step forward . with latter development , more hydrodynamical models have been employed in heavy ion physics , from bjorken s one - dimensional boost - invariant hydrodynamics to hydrodynamics in two - dimensional and three - dimensional space , additonally with viscosity and fluctuated initialization .",
    "thus hydrodynamics has become one of the most powerful models , with more and more experimental observables explained , with a more and more realistic but also complicate hydrodynamical evolution . in this paper",
    "we will develop the recent work@xcite , investigate the employment of the olddest and simplest hydrodynamical model , landau hydrodynamical model , to rhic and lhc experiments .",
    "the paper is organized as following . in section",
    "ii , we will introduce our calculation approach of particle production based on landau model . in section iii",
    "we will present our results on both rapidity distribution and transverse spectra of the most copious particles such as charged pions , kaons and antiproton from central au+au collisions at @xmath0  gev and central pb+pb collisions at @xmath1  tev , and compare with rhic and lhc data .",
    "the effects from different freeze - out conditions and equation of states will be shown as well . in section",
    "iv we will draw the conclusions on what we have learned from this exercise .",
    "hydrodynamics is often employed to describe the evolution of the collision system , from an initial time ( initial condition ) to a freeze - out time ( fo condition ) . during this period ,",
    "the system is governed with the energy - momentum conservation law @xmath3 solving this fluid equation with a given dynamical equation of state ( eos ) , and decomposing the energy - momentum tensor @xmath4 one can obtain the energy density @xmath5 , pressure @xmath6 , flow velocity @xmath7 at each space - time point of the collision system . here",
    "we assume an ideal hydrodynamics for the system .",
    "more term should be included in ( [ t^munu ] ) once viscosity is considered .",
    "the proper time coordinate @xmath8 , space - time rapidity coordinate @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are often used to note each space - time point .",
    "thus @xmath12 or inversely @xmath13    the initial state of the landau hydrodynamical model is a thin static disk of thickness @xmath14 and diameter @xmath15 .",
    "it is assumed to be the approximation of the overlap of two highly lorentz contracted nuclei , and the two geometrical sizes are assumed to be related by @xmath16 with @xmath17 the lorentz factor corresponding to the velocity of the colliding nuclei in the center - of - mass frame , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the invariant collision energy per colliding nucleons of mass @xmath20 .",
    "the landau hydrodynamical evolution of the system is divided in two parts : the initial longitudinal expansion ( during which transverse velocities and displacements are neglected ) , and the subsequent  \" conic flight  \" , where transverse velocities appear and hadronic particles freeze out of the fluid .    assuming a simple dynamical eos of the form @xmath21 an approximate solution of the 1 + 1 dimensional problem of the longitudinal expansion phase is given by landau  @xcite",
    "this solution is summarized ( using the notation of @xcite ) as follow .",
    "the energy - density field is @xmath22 where @xmath23 are logarithmic light - cone coordinates @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the initial energy - density of the disk .",
    "the flow four - velocity are expressed as @xmath26 the momentum rapidity of the flow @xmath27 coincides with the space - time rapidity coordinate @xmath9 defined in eq.([eq : rapi field ] ) , similarly to the case of the bjorken model .",
    "now is the step of  \" conic flight  \" , with hadronic particles freezing out of the fluid .",
    "the four - momentum of each particle can be specified as @xmath28 in terms of its transverse momentum @xmath29 , rapidity @xmath30 and azimuth angle @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the transverse mass , with the mass of the particle , @xmath33 .",
    "the distribution of emitted hadrons in the momentum space is calculated with the cooper - frye formula  @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the phase - space distribution of particles at freeze - out .",
    "the phase - space distribution has the thermal form @xmath36 with @xmath37=1 for fermions , -1 for bosons and 0 for classical particles obeying boltzmann statistics .",
    "@xmath38 is a degeneracy factor that is different for each particles species .",
    "the temperature at a given space - time point @xmath39 is obtained from the energy - density field in eq.([eq : e field ] ) with a certain eos .    in previous work",
    "@xcite , a hadronic gas eos has been used , where the massive particles in the hadronic phase is assumed to obey the relativistic boltzmann distribution .",
    "then the pressure of the medium is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the mass and degeneracy factor of particle type @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is a modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "the energy - density and temperature is related via @xmath45 where we used the notation @xmath46 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , this relation is plotted with dashed line and note as  \" pion  \" , since the lightest mesons contribute the most to the pressure and energy density of hadronic gas .",
    "the same relation calculated with quark and gluon degree of freedom has been plotted with solid line and noted as  \" qgp  \" .",
    "we also plot lattice result@xcite as dotted dashed line and note as",
    " \" lqcd  \" .",
    "one can see lattice eos coincides with qgp one at high energy density and coincides with pion one at low energy density .",
    "it is clear that no pions at very high energy density and no qgp at very low temperature , and lqcd result is a more realistic choice . in the following",
    "we repeat the previous calculation with pion eos and also take lqcd eos as a comparison .",
    "( color online ) temperature dependence of energy density . dashed line : calculated according to pion gas ; solid line : calculated with qgp freedom ; dotted - dashed line : lqcd result@xcite . ]",
    "we will employ landau fluid dynamics in to rhic and lhc heavy ion collisions , in the most simple case , central collisions .",
    "therefore , the landau solution of energy density in eq.([eq : e field ] ) is plotted as a function of @xmath9 and @xmath8 in left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , where upper panel for the central pb+pb collision at @xmath1  tev and lower panel for the central au+au collision at @xmath0  gev .",
    "the corresponding temperature is plotted in the right panel , based on two choices of eos .        to calculate hadrons spectrum with cooper - frye formula in eq.([eq : cf ] ) , we treat the hypersurface element four - vector @xmath47 at each space - time point of fo surface , in terms of @xmath48 and @xmath11 according to eq.([xyzt ] ) for the convenience of calculation .",
    "insert @xmath49 into eq.([eq : cf ] ) , and make use of eq.([eq : u y ] ) , one can get @xmath50 and @xmath51 where the integral over @xmath10 and @xmath11 has been done .    in refs .",
    "@xcite an estimate of the time of freeze - out is @xmath52 we take this as a choice of fo condition",
    ". currently the popular fo condition is at a fixed temperature around @xmath53  mev .",
    "here we take a constant energy density @xmath54 as another choice of fo condition , which corresponds to a fixed temperature via eos . since fo is a change of the treatment on collision systems , from a collective mode to the collection of many single particles",
    ", this change should happen after the appearance of hadrons .",
    "therefore , a realistic fo condition , should not occur at too high energy density where the matter is still in qgp phase . according to fig .",
    "1 , three values 0.08 , 0.16 and 0.24  gev/@xmath55 were employed for @xmath54 , because pion eos and lqcd eos coincide at @xmath56  gev/@xmath55 and 0.24  gev/@xmath55 roughly corresponds to @xmath57 according to lqcd eos .    with the fo condition @xmath58 and the solution of landau fluid in eq.([eq : e field ] )",
    ", we can get the freeze - out time at each given space point as the following form , @xmath59 where the constant @xmath60 , @xmath25 the initial energy - density of the disk , @xmath14 the initial thickness of the disk and @xmath9 the space - time rapidity of the given space point . then the integral along freez - out hypersurface can be done easily with eqs.([pmu_umu ] , [ umu_sigmamu ] ) .",
    "we first repeated the previous work  @xcite , calculated the rapidity spectra of charged pions from central au+au collision at @xmath0  gev with the same fo condition @xmath61 and the same eos .",
    "the result is shown as a dashed line in fig .  3 , a very nice coincidence with brahms data where empty squares for @xmath62 and empty cycles for @xmath63 .",
    "however , this nice coincidence is just an accidence . we explain this in the following .    in fig .  3 ,",
    "the dashed line was decomposed into several dotted lines which are the contributions from different @xmath9 bin [ -6,-4],[-4,-2 ] , ... , [ 4,6 ] , respectively . the energy density and the temperature along @xmath9-axis at @xmath64 correspond to the second lines on the lower panel of fig .",
    "as one can see , most midrapidity pions come out from the fluid at @xmath65 where the temperature is as high as 300  mev .",
    "this is not realistic because hadrons should not appear at such a high temperature , where the baryonic chemical potentil is almost zero .",
    "in fact , this energy density is too high to employ pion eos , according to fig .  1 .",
    "( color online ) rapidity distribution of charged pions in central au+au collision at @xmath0  gev .",
    "dashed line is calculated with pion eos and decomposed dotted lines for the contributions from @xmath9 bin [ -6,-4],[-4,-2 ] , ... , [ 4,6 ] , respectively .",
    "data points are from @xcite . ]",
    "then we took lqcd eos instead .",
    "this decreases the temperature at @xmath61 quite a lot , c.f .",
    "the right panel of fig .  2 .",
    "in fig .  4 , the resulted rapidity distribution of charged pions and charged kaons , shown as solid lines , and pion eos results shown as dashed lines , are compared with brahms data points  @xcite .",
    "while pion eos results can reproduce brahms measured pion and kaon rapidity distribution , this realistic lqcd eos calculation can not !",
    "the reason is clear . at @xmath61 , hadrons of large rapidity",
    "mainly freeze out from the fluid at large-@xmath9 , where energy density is low and lqcd eos coincides with pion eos .",
    "while at midrapidity , hadrons mainly freeze out from fluid at @xmath65 where the energy density is high .",
    "then the temperature interpreted with lqcd eos is much lower than that with pion eos , which makes less hadron emission at midrapidity . as a result ,",
    "the rapidity shape with lqcd eos becomes broader and deviates from the measured data .",
    "the correct choice of lqcd eos itself can not reproduce the data , but the deviation can tell us even more .",
    "( color online ) rapidity distribution of pion(upper panel ) and kaon(lower panel ) in central au+au collision at @xmath0  gev , with pion eos(dashed line ) and lqcd eos(solid line ) .",
    "data points are from @xcite . ]    to understand the deviation better , we calculated the transverse mass spectra of charged pions and kaons from central au+au collisions at @xmath0  gev , with the fo condition @xmath61 and two options of eos . the result with pion eos is shown in fig .  5 , where solid lines for pions and dashed lines for kaons , at midrapidity @xmath66 ( left panel ) and forward rapidity @xmath67 ( right panel ) and compared with brahms data where full cycles for @xmath63 and full squares for @xmath68 .",
    "the calculation with lqcd eos is plotted in fig .  6 , where the same notation has been used .",
    "again , similar results appear at forward rapidity @xmath67 for both eos , where particles freeze out from quite low energy density source and two eos coincidence",
    ".    however , at midrapidity @xmath66 , the inverse slope of the transverse spectra of both pions and kaons from lqcd calculation is lower than experimental data , while the calculation with pion eos makes higher the inverse slope for pions , due to the extremely high temperature interpreted with pion eos .    the second line in lower - right panel of fig .",
    "2 tells the temperature interpreted with lqcd is about 200  mev at @xmath65 , which is lower than pion eos value , but still higher than @xmath69 160  mev .",
    "then why the calculated inverse slopes of both pions and kaons are still lower than experimental data ? because there is no transverse expansion in landau hydrodynamics .",
    "hydrodynamical models with transverse expansion and freeze - out at 160  mev can make higher inverse slope of transverse spectra and reproduce the data , i.e.  @xcite .",
    "the deviation tell us , the collective transverse expansion of the collision systems is important to explain the measured transverse spectra .",
    "the midrapidity transverse momentum spectra of charged pions , kaons and antiproton from central pb+pb collisions at @xmath1  tev , with the fo condition @xmath61 and two options of eos are shown in fig .  7 , where solid lines for pion eos and dashed lines for lqcd eos , and alice data  @xcite shown as full cycles",
    ". again we can see pion eos gives high inverse slopes than lqcd .",
    "the calculated pion slope with lqcd eos seems to reproduce the data , again by accidence . because the fo condition @xmath61 makes a much higher energy density and the temperature at freeze - out is interppreted as high as 400  mev , c.f . the second line in the upper panel of fig .",
    "2 . this compensates the missing of transverse expansion in landau fluid .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] , the deviation of transverse spectra between data and lqcd results , becomes bigger and bigger , as the mass ordering from pion , kaon to antiproton .",
    "this is because , transverse flow drives heavier particles to move along radial direction at the same collective velocity as light particles .",
    "however , heavier particles gain more energies and higher inverse slope of the transverse momentum spectra . in another word ,",
    "transverse expansion of the collision systems becomes more and more important with the increase of hadron mass .        as mentioned above , the fo condition @xmath61 is not realistic , because the energy density and temperature vary a lot along the beam direction . in the following ,",
    "we take a constant energy density @xmath54 as a fo condition .    in fig .",
    "8 are shown the transverse mass spectra of pion ( upper panel ) and kaon ( lower panel ) in central au+au collision at @xmath0  gev , where left panel for y=0 and right panel for y=3.5 , with solid line , dashed line and dotted line for @xmath54=0.08 , 0.16 , 0.24  gev/@xmath55 , respectively .",
    "the higher @xmath54 can slightly increase the inverse slope of the transverse spectra , while the slopes are still far from the brahms data , due the missing of transverse flow in laudau fluid .        in fig .",
    "9 are shown the midrapidity transverse momentum spectra of charged pions , kaons and antiproton from central pb+pb collisions at @xmath1  tev , with the fo condition @xmath54=0.08 , 0.16 , 0.24  gev/@xmath55 shown as solid lines , dashed lines and dotted lines respectively .",
    "alice data  @xcite are shown as full cycles .",
    "again , higher @xmath54 makes slightly higher inverse slope . but compared with fig .  8 for the case of central au+au collision at @xmath0  gev , the miss of transverse expansion of landau fluid in central pb+pb collisions at @xmath1  tev is even stronger , for the larger and hotter collision system .",
    "in summary , we demonstrated the production of most copious particles from central au+au collisions at @xmath0  gev and central pb+pb collisions at @xmath1  tev in the framework of landau hydrodynamical model .",
    "the measured rapidity distribution of pions and kaons from central au+au collisions at @xmath0  gev and the transverse momentum spectrum of pions from central pb+pb collisions at @xmath1  tev can be reproduced with landau model by accidence , due to the choice of fo condition @xmath61 and the employment of pion eos .",
    "this fo condition makes most hadrons freeze out from a fluid at very high energy density .",
    "the employment of pion eos causes that the temperature at which hadrons are emitted is interppreted to be as high as 400  mev .",
    "the emission of hadrons at high density and high temperature compensates the missing of transverse expansion in landau hydrodynamical model .    with a more realistic choice of fo condition , fixed at a relatively low energy density , and the employment of lqcd eos for particle production",
    ", we can see that transverse expansion becomes important to explain bulk hadron production in high energy nuclear collisions .",
    "especially , with the increase of collision energy from rhic to lhc , and with the increase of the mass of produced hadrons , transverse expansion becomes more and more important ."
