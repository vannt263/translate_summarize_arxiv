    "the discovery of novel microwave - induced oscillations of magnetoresistivity  @xcite as a function of the magnetic field @xmath0 and so - called zero - resistance states ( zrs )  @xcite has sparked a large interest in quantum magnetotransport of two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems exposed to microwave ( mw ) radiation .",
    "the 1/b - periodic oscillations were observed for quite arbitrary mw  frequencies @xmath1 larger than the cyclotron frequency @xmath2 .",
    "the period of these oscillations is governed by the ratio @xmath3 .",
    "zrs appear in ultrahigh - mobility gaas / algaas heterostructures as a result of evolution of the minima of the oscillations with an increase in radiation power .",
    "recently , mw - induced magnetooscillations and vanishing of the magnetoconductance @xmath4 were observed in the nondegenerate multisubband 2d electron system formed on the liquid helium surface  @xcite .",
    "these oscillations have many striking similarities with those observed in semiconductor systems : they are 1/b - periodic , governed by the ratio @xmath3 , and their minima eventually evolve in zero magnetoconductance states nearly at the same values of @xmath3 .",
    "the important distinction of these new oscillations is that they are observed only for a mw frequency fixed to the resonance condition for excitation of the second surface subband : @xmath5 ( here @xmath6 , and @xmath7 describes the energy spectrum of surface electron states , @xmath8 ) .",
    "the zrs observed in semiconductor systems are shown  @xcite to be understood as a direct consequence of the negative photoconductivity @xmath9 which can appear with an increase in the amplitude of conductivity oscillations . regarding the microscopic origin of the oscillations ,",
    "the most frequently studied mechanism is based on photon - induced impurity scattering within the ground subband , when an electron simultaneously is scattered off impurities and absorb or emit microwave quanta  @xcite .",
    "this kind of scattering is accompanied by an electron displacement along the applied dc - electric field whose sign depends on the sign of @xmath10 ( here @xmath11 ) .",
    "therefore , sometimes this mechanism is termed the `` displacement '' mechanism .",
    "a different mechanism , called the `` inelastic '' mechanism  @xcite , explains conductivity oscillations as a result of oscillatory changes of the isotropic part of the in - plane electron distribution function .",
    "both microscopic mechanisms of the negative conductivity prosed for semiconductor systems can not be applied for explanation of similar effects observed in the system of surface electrons ( ses ) on liquid helium , because the mw frequency considered in these theories has no relation to inter - subband excitation frequencies @xmath12 .",
    "recently , a new mechanism of negative momentum dissipation relevant to experiments with ses on liquid helium was briefly reported  @xcite .",
    "it can not be attributed to `` displacement '' or `` inelastic '' mechanisms . in this theory , the origin of magnetooscillations and negative dissipation is an additional filling of the second surface subband induced by mw irradiation under the resonance condition ( @xmath13 ) , which triggers quasi - elastic inter - subband electron scattering . the ordinary inter - subband scattering , which does not involve photon quanta , is accompanied by electron displacements whose sign depends on the sign of @xmath14 .",
    "usually , this scattering does not lead to any negative contribution to @xmath4 .",
    "a correction to @xmath4 proportional to @xmath15 was shown to appear only if @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the number of electrons at the corresponding subband , and @xmath18 is the electron temperature .",
    "it is important that this correction is also proportional to a large parameter equal to the ratio of @xmath18 to the collision broadening of landau levels .    in this work ,",
    "we perform a systematic theoretical study of negative dissipation phenomena in a multisubband 2d electron system caused by non - equilibrium filling of excited subbands .",
    "the magnetotransport theory  @xcite is generalized in order to include electron scattering by capillary wave quanta ( ripplons ) which limits se mobility in experiments  @xcite , where vanishing magnetoconductivity @xmath4 is observed . in order to understand the importance of mw heating at the vicinity of commensurability points , electron energy relaxation is analyzed . a sign - changing correction to the energy relaxation rate similar to the sign - changing correction to the momentum relaxation rate",

    "it increases with the holding electric field @xmath35 , which allows also to tune @xmath30 in resonance with the mw frequency .    under typical experimental conditions ,",
    "the electron - electron collision rate @xmath36 of ses is much higher than the energy and momentum relaxation rates .",

    "average scattering probabilities of ses on liquid helium and even the effective collision frequency @xmath69 can be expressed in terms of the dynamical structure factor ( dsf ) of the 2d electron liquid  @xcite @xmath70 .",
    "this procedure somehow reminds the theory of thermal neutron ( or x - ray ) scattering by solids , where the scattering cross - section is expressed as an integral form of a dsf . without mw irradiation ,",
    "most of unusual properties of the quantum magnetotransport of ses on liquid helium are well described by the equilibrium dsf of the 2d electron liquid  @xcite .",
    "a multisubband electron system is actually a set of 2d electron systems .",
    "therefore , the single factor @xmath71 is not appropriate for description of inter - subband electron scattering . luckily , for non - interacting electrons , we can easily find an extension of @xmath71 which could be used in expressions for average scattering probabilities of a multisubband system:@xmath72 where@xmath73!}{[\\max(n , n^{\\prime } ) ] ! } x^{|n - n^{\\prime}|}e^{-x}\\left [   l_{\\min(n , n^{\\prime})}^{|n - n^{\\prime}%    @xmath74 are the associated laguerre polynomials .",
