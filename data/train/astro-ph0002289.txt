    "images of hubble 12 ( hb 12 ) were obtained with the hst / nicmos instrument on 13 nov 1997 .",
    "the images in the f110w , f164n , and f166n were taken with nic1 , and the f160w , f187n , f190n , f212n , f215n images were obtained with nic2 .",
    "the multiaccum mode and spiral dither patterns were used .",
    "the nicmos calnica and calnicb pipelines were used to reduce the data . in general a few dither sets were obtained in each filter ; these were aligned and averaged to produce the final images .",
    "the bright central star makes the region near the core difficult to see clearly , and adds a number of image artifacts .",
    "the lines that run approximately from corner to corner are part of the diffraction pattern of the instrument .",
    "the horizontal and vertical lines that run through the star are array artifacts caused when the central star saturates in the long integrations . in future reductions",
    "we will attempt to subtract the point source in the core to better study the region around it .",
    "hb 12 has been notable primarily because it represents one of the clearest cases known of uv excited near - ir fluorescent h@xmath0 emission ( dinerstein et al .",
    "1988 ; ramsay et al .  1993 ,",
    "hora & latter 1996 , luhman & rieke 1996 ) .",
    "dinerstein et al .  had mapped the inner structure and found it to be elliptical surrounding the central star ; the deep h@xmath0 images in hora & latter ( 1996 ) showed the faint bipolar lobes extending n - s , and the torus or  eye \"-",
    "shaped strucure at the base of the lobes around the central star .",
    "the h@xmath0 line ratios observed in the torus were in excellent agreement with predictions by theoretical h@xmath0 fluorescence calculations ( see also luhman & rieke 1996 ) .",
    "hora & latter also detected [ fe  ii ] line emission at 1.64  in a position along the edge of the shell , but not at the h@xmath0 line peak emission location to the e of the central star .",
    "previous hst - wpc2 imaging by sahai & trauger ( 1998 ) in h@xmath1 showed the inner structure to have an  hourglass \" shape , and a small bipolar structure in the core region , with lobes roughly e - w within a few tenths of an arcsec from the star .",
    "welch et al .",
    "( 1999a , b ) obtained ground - based images in the [ fe  ii ] line and nearby continuum and found that the line emission was also distributed along the inner hourglass nebula . the hst images presented here",
    "show the symmetry axes of the hourglass and the h@xmath0 eye and bipolar nebula differ in their alignment by @xmath2 5@xmath3 .",
    "a comparison of these images with the inner bipolar structure found by sahai & trauger shows that its alignment differs by @xmath4 from the hourglass and outer h@xmath0 lobes .",
    "the different orientation of the structures suggests that the central source may be precessing between discrete outflow events .",
    "also , the structures seen in the h@xmath0 image indicate other possible outflow events and remnants of other bipolar hourglass nebulae .",
    "hb  12 may therefore be another example of a pn with multiple nested bipolar bubbles .",
    "the inner hourglass is bright in the paschen @xmath1 and [ fe  ii ] lines , but the outline of the `` eye '' appears only in the h@xmath0 and the wide bandpass filters ( in continuum plus h@xmath0 line emission ) .",
    "this implies that the regions where only h@xmath0 is detected are somehow shielded from what has ionized the inner hourglass .",
    "there is no evidence for [ fe  ii ] emission from other regions in the nebula , and the density of the inner hourglass does not seem sufficient to provide effective shielding of the other regions from radiation from the central star , which might suggest shock excitation in an interacting wind .",
    "this hypothesis must be confirmed with investigation of the velocity structure in the nebula .",
    "the strong influence of fuv photons elsewhere in this object argues that the [ fe  ii ] emission is excited by fuv photons in the pdr .",
    "we will be investigating this possibility through detailed chemical modeling .",
    "we obtained high - resolution ir spectra of hb  12 in the h@xmath0 and [ fe  ii ] lines using cshell at the irtf ( kelly , hora , & latter 1999 ) which indicates that the n lobe is inclined towards us .",
    "we also have additional medium - resolution spectra of the faint extended h@xmath0 lobes to determine the excitation properties of the outer nebula .",
    "we are in the process of analyzing these data along with the optical and ir imagery to understand the structure of this interesting and complex nebula ."
