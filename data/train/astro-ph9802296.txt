    "sn 1980k [ ra(1950.0)@xmath12 dec(1950.0)@xmath13 in ngc 6946 was discovered in 1980 october by wild ( 1980 ) , and an initial , unsuccessful attempt was made on 1980 november 3 to detect it at 6 cm with the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "however , only 35 days after optical maximum sn 1980k was detected at 6 cm on 1980 december 4 and has been regularly monitored at 20 , 6 , and occasionally 2 cm since then .",
    "results from 1980 november through 1984 august are presented in weiler et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , and results from 1984 november through 1990 december are presented in weiler et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . by 1990",
    "december the flux density had fallen to @xmath14 mjy at 20 and 6 cm , which made it difficult to observe with the vla using typical , short `` snapshot '' observations , and regular monitoring was terminated .    however , optical imaging and spectra taken after 1990 indicated that sn 1980k was still a detectable , albeit relatively constant optical luminosity source , particularly at h@xmath15 ( leibundgut 1994 ) .",
    "late - time optical and radio emission are predicted to be correlated ( chevalier & fransson 1994 ) , and in several examples are indeed observed to be related ( see , e.g. , montes et al .",
    "1997 , van dyk et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) . therefore ,",
    "deeper and more sensitive vla observations were made in 1994 , 1995 , and 1996 at both 20 and 6 cm , to attempt to obtain new measurements of sn 1980k below our previous sensitivity limits .",
    "interestingly , these new data indicate that sn 1980k has , in fact , _ not _ continued along its previously observed power - law decline , but has dropped sharply in radio flux density in the interval between 1990 and 1994 .",
    "additionally , recent measurements ( fesen 1998 ) indicate that sn  1980k has also faded in the optical over the last several years , possibly starting with a 20% decline by 1994 as reported by fesen , hurford , & matonick ( 1995 ) .",
    "the new radio measurements are presented here , and they indicate a significant change in the evolution of the radio emission of sn 1980k from earlier , model - based expectations .",
    "the new observations of sn 1980k were made with the vla at 20 cm ( 1.46 ghz ) and 6 cm ( 4.89 ghz ) on 1994 april 10 , 1995 june 22 ( 20 cm only ) , and 1996 october 1314 , when the vla was in the `` a '' configuration , to reduce the confusion with background emission from the parent galaxy ngc 6946 .",
    "each observation was accompanied by measurement at each frequency of a `` secondary , '' possibly variable , calibrator ( 2021 + 614 ) , with a well - known position , making it suitable as a phase reference . to establish an absolute flux density scale ,",
    "a `` primary '' calibrator ( 3c 286 , except on 1995 june 22 , when 3c 48 was used ) was also observed and used to calibrate the amplitude of 2021 + 614 for each observing session .",
    "additional observations of sn 1980k on 1994 april 01 and 1994 june 16 were kindly provided by c.  lacey ( 1997 ; see also lacey , duric , & goss 1997 ) .",
    "the vla is described in a number of publications ( e.g. , thompson et al .",
    "1980 ; hjellming & bignell 1982 ; napier , thompson , & ekers 1983 ) ; the general procedures for rsn observations , with the sources of possible error , are discussed in weiler et al .",
    "the primary calibrators employed here , 3c 48 for the 1995 june observation and 3c 286 for the rest , were assumed to be constant in flux density with time and to have the flux densities at 20 cm and 6 cm of @xmath16 jy , @xmath17 jy , and @xmath18 jy .    the secondary calibrator , 2021 + 614 , was used as the phase ( position ) [ ra(1950.0)=@xmath19 , dec(1950.0)=@xmath20 and amplitude ( flux density ) reference for the observations of sn 1980k .",
    "its flux density ( measured against 3c 48 or 3c 286 ) at 20 cm and 6 cm is presented for each observing date in table [ tb : cal ] , and its flux density evolution with time since 1980 is shown in figure [ fig : cal ] .",
    "the data were processed in a standard manner using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) provided by nrao .",
    "error estimates are derived as in weiler et al.(1991 ) .",
    "that is , the rms `` map '' error , @xmath21 , in an image only provides a lower limit to the total error , so that we add quadratically an error of 5% of the measured flux density to account for inaccuracies in the flux density calibration and any absolute scale errors in the primary calibrators .",
    "the the final errors , @xmath22 , are taken as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the observed flux density for sn 1980k and @xmath21 is the observed rms map error measured outside of any obvious regions of emission .",
    "since the previous publication of sn 1980k data in weiler et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , we have added three new vla measurements at 20 cm , and two at 6 cm .",
    "ngc 6946 was also surveyed with the vla by lacey et al.(1997 ) for compact sources on 1994 april 1 at 20 cm in the `` a '' configuration , and on 1994 june 16 at 6 cm in the `` b '' configuration .",
    "although outside of their @xmath25 region of interest centered on the nucleus of ngc 6946 , sn 1980k was detected in their survey at 20 cm .",
    "since the sn was @xmath26 from their field center and suffered primary beam attenuation , their measurement of flux density was corrected by 6.9% with the standard aips task pbcor .",
    "their 6 cm observation suffered even more severe attenuation at the location of sn 1980k , and only an upper limit on the 6 cm flux density could be established for the sn .",
    "twelve revised measurementswe include in table [ tb : data ] eight previously published measurements which were originally listed in weiler et al .",
    "( 1986 , 1992 ) as @xmath27 detections .",
    "we now feel a conservative approach to consider these data as @xmath28 upper limits is more appropriate .",
    "additionally , we have remeasured four previously - published results and list these revised values in table [ tb : data ] . as can be seen from a comparison of table [ tb : par ] in this paper with table 4 in weiler et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , the effect of these changes on the best - fit model parameters is relatively small . ] between 1980 november 3 and 1990 december 9 and the six new measurements plus one upper limit between 1994 april 1 and 1996 october 14 are presented in table [ tb : data ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : lc ] we plot the entire time evolution of the flux density for sn 1980k at both 20 and 6 cm , from 1980 november 3 to 1996 october 14 .",
    "this includes the new ( and revised ) results , together with earlier measurements from weiler et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and weiler et al .",
    "the 6 cm upper limit from lacey ( 1997 ) for 1994 june 16 is consistent with our measurement on 1994 april 10 . the 20 cm measurement by lacey for 1994 april 1 is about 1.5@xmath29 greater than our 20 cm measurement of 1994 april 10 , but the reported uncertainties overlap .",
    "weiler et al .  ( 1986 ) discuss the common properties of radio - emitting supernovae ( sne ) , known as radio sne ( rsne ) , including nonthermal synchrotron emission with high brightness temperature , turn - on delay at longer wavelengths , power - law decline after maximum with index @xmath30 , and spectral index @xmath15 asymptotically decreasing to an optically thin value .",
    "weiler et al .  (",
    "1986 ) have also shown that the `` mini - shell '' model of chevalier ( 1982a , b ) adequately describes known type ii rsne . in this model , the relativistic electrons and enhanced magnetic fields",
    "necessary for synchrotron emission are generated by the sn shock interacting with a relatively high - density ionized circumstellar envelope .",
    "this dense cocoon is presumed to have been established by a high mass - loss rate ( @xmath31   @xmath32   10@xmath33 @xmath34   yr@xmath35 ) , low speed ( @xmath36   @xmath37 10  km  s@xmath35 ) wind from a red supergiant ( rsg ) sn progenitor which was ionized and heated by the initial sn uv / x - ray flash . the rapid rise in radio flux density results from the shock overtaking progressively more of the wind matter , leaving less of it along the line - of - sight to absorb the emission from the shock region .    following weiler et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , we adopt the parameterized model : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and with @xmath40 and @xmath41 corresponding , formally , to the flux density in mjy and the uniform external absorption , respectively , at 5  ghz one day after the explosion , @xmath42 .",
    "the term @xmath43 describes the attenuation of a local medium that uniformly covers the emitting source ( `` uniform external absorption '' ) .",
    "this absorbing medium is assumed to be purely thermal , ionized hydrogen with frequency dependence @xmath44 .",
    "the parameter @xmath45 describes the time dependence of the optical depth for this local , uniform medium . for an undecelerated sn shock",
    ", @xmath46 is appropriate ( chevalier 1982a ) .",
    "this parameterization has been found generally applicable to type ii sne , such as sn 1979c ( weiler et al .",
    "1986 , 1991 ) and sn 1980k ( weiler et al .  1986 , 1992 ) , with values of @xmath45 close to the undecelerated value ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 for sn 1979c and sn 1980k , respectively ; see table [ tb : par ] ) .",
    "the best - fit model parameters are listed in table [ tb : par ] , only using data through 1989 july 23 .",
    "this fit is slightly different from that of weiler et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , due to improved fitting software and reclassification and remeasurement of some data points ( see footnote [ fn : long ] ) , but the difference is not deemed to be significant .    the errors in the fitting parameters in table [ tb : par ] were estimated using a `` bootstrap '' procedure ( press et al .",
    "bootstrap procedures use the actual data sets to generate thousands of synthetic data sets that have the same number of data points , but some fraction of the data is replaced by duplicated original points .",
    "the fitting parameters are then estimated for these synthetic data sets using the same algorithms that are used to determine the parameters from the actual data .",
    "the ensemble of parameter fits is then used to estimate errors for the parameters by examining number distributions for the parameter in question .",
    "the errors we present correspond to the 15.85% and 84.15% points in the distribution of the occurrence of parameters from the synthetic data .",
    "figure [ fig : lc ] shows all of the data available through 1996 october 14 , with the best - fit model up to day 3200 shown for 6 cm ( _ solid line _ ) and 20 cm ( _ dashed line _ ) .",
    "after day 4900 we extrapolate this model with the same decline rate @xmath30 and same spectral index @xmath15 , but with a discontinuity of 55% introduced between day 3200 and day 4900 .",
    "note that the single detection on day 3692 ( 1990 december 9 ) , and several low upper limits at 6 cm , imply that the drop - off actually started sometime between the last 6 cm detection on day 3188 ( 1989 july 23 ) and day 3692 .",
    "also note that the extrapolated model light curves after day 4900 , while showing the preservation of the spectral index ( see figure [ fig : si ] ) and consistent with the available data , are not considered to have any predictive value , because of the large uncertainty in the data .",
    "the data are also consistent with a constant flux density ( i.e. , with @xmath49 ) after day 4900 .",
    "figure [ fig : si ] shows the evolution of the spectral index , @xmath50 , between 6 and 20 cm ; the _ solid line _ is derived from the model fit in table [ tb : par ] .",
    "examination of figure [ fig : lc ] shows that radio observations of sn 1980k , at least through day 3200 , are consistent with the tenets of the chevalier ( 1982a , b ) model , as described by weiler et al .",
    "however , sometime between day @xmath51 and day @xmath52 the radio emission of sn 1980k changed dramatically , dropping by a factor of @xmath0 below the values expected from the previously best - fit model .",
    "this roll - off is even roughly described by the single 6 cm detection on day 3692 ( 1990 december 9 ) and the several 6 cm upper limits around that time .",
    "interestingly , however , the large change in flux density has apparently not affected the spectral index evolution shown in figure [ fig : si ] .",
    "the best - fit post - decrease spectral index , @xmath53 , is consistent to within the errors with the pre - decrease spectral index , @xmath54 .",
    "while such a sharp drop could imply a change in emission mechanism , emission efficiency , or shock transition to a non - radiative phase , we interpret the apparently constant spectral index to imply that the basic shock - driven emission mechanism has remained unchanged , and that the flux density drop is most likely due to a deviation of the average circumstellar medium ( csm ) density behavior from the standard @xmath55 law , expected for a pre - sn rsg wind with constant mass - loss rate ( @xmath8 ) and constant speed ( @xmath7 ) .    since the radio luminosity of a sn is @xmath56 ( @xmath57 is the relativistic electron energy index and @xmath58 , where the shock radius evolves as @xmath59 , and @xmath45",
    "is defined in  4 ; chevalier 1982a , b ) , it is related to the average circumstellar density ( @xmath60 ) , a measure of the deviation of the radio emission from the standard model may provide , assuming all other aspects of the emission mechanism remain unchanged , an indication of a deviation of the circumstellar density from the canonical @xmath55 law appropriate for a constant mass - loss rate ( @xmath8 ) , constant speed ( @xmath7 ) pre - sn stellar wind .",
    "thus , for sn 1980k with @xmath61 , a flux density decrease by a factor of @xmath0 implies , for a constant emission mechanism , a decrease in @xmath62 by a factor of @xmath63 .",
    "the expressions we use from the chevalier model assume a power - law csm density distribution .",
    "they predict that a very small cs density leads to a very small radio luminosity",
    ". however , if there is a sudden drop in the density , the previously accelerated electrons will continue to radiate , and the radio luminosity will only decrease due to adiabatic expansion .",
    "this implies that the density changes which we obtain are , strictly speaking , lower limits , since some of the radio luminosity must be coming from electrons that were accelerated before the shock entered the less dense medium . ]",
    "weiler et al .  ( 1986 ) predicted the possibility of a sharp decrease in the flux density for rsne when the shock reaches the edge of the high - density , low - speed stellar wind csm established during the rsg phase of the pre - sn star , and such a sharp decrease in flux density has also been observed in sn  1957d at 6 and 20 cm ( cowan , roberts , & branch 1994 ) , accompanied by a steep decline at optical wavelengths ( long , winkler , & blair 1992 ) .",
    "unfortunately , since the sn  1957d radio measurements span only two epochs with the observations occurring @xmath3726 and @xmath3733 years after discovery , we have no knowledge of the prior radio behavior ( spectral index evolution and temporal history ) of sn  1957d , and such a sharp drop in flux density has not been documented in any other supernova with well - observed radio light curves . in at least the two cases of sn 1987a ( turtle et al .",
    "1990 ; staveley - smith et al .",
    "1992 , 1993 , 1995 ; ball et al .  1995 ; gaensler et al .",
    "1997 ) and sn 1979c ( montes et al .",
    "1998 ) , changes in the radio flux density evolution at ages of a few years imply that the shock is encountering a _ denser _ , rather than less dense , csm .    our suggested change in the progenitor s mass - loss rate ( or wind speed , or both ) would have occurred at a time before explosion of about @xmath64 years or , assuming @xmath65 km s@xmath66 and @xmath67 km s@xmath66 , @xmath68 years before the sn .",
    "( note that @xmath69 implies a small deceleration of the shock with time , since the shock radius @xmath59 , but given other uncertainties in this estimate , we will not correct for that here . )",
    "the change between implied mass - loss rates ( or wind speeds , or both ) occurred within @xmath70 years , or @xmath71 years with the assumptions made above .",
    "( on day 3200 sn 1980k still appeared to be declining normally ; by day 3700 it was already suspiciously below the model prediction , and by day 4900 it was observed to have declined significantly below model predictions . )",
    "the _ minimum _ time scale of a high - to - low density transition is set by light travel time and corresponds to @xmath72 , so that the drop over @xmath73 years occurring @xmath74 years after explosion does not violate this @xmath75 year limit .",
    "both the pre-1990 evolutionary phase and the 1990-to-1994 change - of - phase are short , compared to the lifetime of typical rsg progenitor stars ( 51 myr for stellar masses 715 @xmath76 , respectively ) .",
    "they are also shorter than the evolutionary time since the last `` blue - loop '' he - burning episode ( several @xmath77 years ) for stars with masses of @xmath37 712 @xmath76 for solar metallicity ( and higher masses for lower metallicities ; see brocato & castellani 1993 ; langer & maeder 1995 ) .",
    "the fast drop observed for the sn  1980k radio emission , if due to a density transition , requires a highly - structured csm from a rapid pre - sn stellar evolution and variations of @xmath78 by factors of at least 1.5  2 over time intervals as short as 10,000 years or less .",
    "such rapid phase changes have not been explored fully by stellar evolution models , but may be similar to the well - known blue - loops occurring in the he - burning evolutionary phase , with much shorter time scales .",
    "it is conceivable that these short excursions are the final phases of evolution for massive stars , as they pass through successive nuclear burnings ( c - burning , o - burning , etc . ) , which are of increasingly shorter duration and may cause the star to quickly move in the hertzsprung - russell diagram , from red to blue ( or less red ) , and back again . in this context , it is interesting to note that for sn  1987a the final blue supergiant phase , following a rsg phase , is estimated to have lasted @xmath79 years .",
    "it thus appears that the final stages of evolution of massive stars may be more complex than usually understood .",
    "the previously - noted change in the radio evolution of sn 1987a and sn 1979c , together with this change in sn 1980k , now provides three examples of sne where possible changes in the csm density structure have been observed and imply significant changes in stellar evolution on time scales of only a few thousand years for the progenitors of these sne . however , since the observed radio characteristics ( and , therefore , presumed csm structure ) are different in each case , there is apparently a range of evolutionary tracks for the massive stars which are sn progenitors .",
    "at an age of @xmath80 years , sn 1980k has apparently , and unexpectedly , entered a new phase of radio evolution , characterized by a large decrease in the flux density at both 6 and 20 cm below that expected from the model describing its previous power - law decline .",
    "the spectral index , however , is apparently unchanged and is consistent with its earlier value , indicating that the emission mechanism is likely the same .",
    "we interpret this radio decrease to imply that the circumstellar density has abruptly changed and the sn shock is now entering a csm region @xmath81 times less dense than the rsg wind - established csm previously encountered by the sn shock .",
    "this is consistent with models for an @xmath82 star that undergoes a `` blue - loop '' evolutionary episode before entering its final rsg phase .",
    "it is interesting to note that changes in the radio emission , and , by implication , in the circumstellar density structure , have also been observed on time scales of a few years ( a few @xmath83 years , in the time frame of the sn progenitor ) for sn 1987a ( turtle et al .",
    "1990 ; staveley - smith et al .",
    "1992 , 1993 , 1995 ; ball et al .  1995 ; gaensler et al .",
    "1997 ) and sn 1979c ( montes et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "although the radio emission from sn 1980k is now very faint ( @xmath84jy ) , we intend to continue monitoring the sn with the vla , to attempt to determine the reality , extent , and the radial profile for this proposed new csm region",
    ". this may allow us to establish the properties and duration of this phase of pre - sn stellar evolution , and may , for the first time , provide a stringent constraint on the mass of the sn progenitor based solely on the sn s radio emission .",

    "<S> new observations of sn 1980k made with the vla at 20 and 6 cm from 1994 april through 1996 october show that the supernova ( sn ) has undergone a significant change in its radio emission evolution , dropping by a factor of @xmath0 below the flux density @xmath1 power - law decline with time @xmath2 observed earlier . </S>",
    "<S> however , although @xmath3 at all observed frequencies has decreased significantly , its current spectral index of @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is consistent with the previous spectral index of @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is suggested that this decrease in emission may be due to the sn shock entering a new region of the circumstellar material which has a lower density than that expected for a constant speed ( @xmath7 ) , constant mass - loss rate ( @xmath8 ) wind from the progenitor . </S>",
    "<S> if such an interpretation is correct , the difference in wind and shock speeds appears to indicate a significant evolution in the mass - loss history of the sn progenitor @xmath9 years before explosion , with a change in circumstellar density ( @xmath10 ) occurring over a time span of @xmath11 kyr . </S>",
    "<S> such features could be explained in terms of a fast `` blue - loop '' evolutionary phase of a relatively massive pre - sn progenitor star . </S>",
    "<S> if so , we may , for the first time , provide a stringent constraint on the mass of the sn progenitor based solely on the sn s radio emission . </S>"
