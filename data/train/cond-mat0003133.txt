    "while two main alternatives have been suggested for addressing the cuprate pseudogap ( the phase fluctuation approach@xcite and the  nodal \" @xmath4-wave quasi - particle picture@xcite ) , this paper presents a third alternative which is based on the presumption that one should investigate small excursions from bcs without abandoning it altogether .",
    "this philosophy rests on the observation that ( i ) @xmath5 is short so that the mean field theoretic approach of bcs should not be expected to be correct in detail and ( ii ) on uemura s observation@xcite that the cuprate superconductors belong to a large class of  exotic \" materials . while the possible role of stripes , spin - charge separation and @xmath4-wave pairing has received much attention in the cuprate literature , here we argue that uemura s famous plot suggests that one formulate a theory of superconductivity around a more universal approach without invoking specific materials - dependent features .",
    "in this paper we present an extension of bcs theory , capable of describing short @xmath5 superconductors , which is intermediate between a bcs and bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) picture ( the  bcs  bec crossover scenario \" ) . at the heart of our approach",
    "is the distinction between the fermionic excitation gap @xmath6 and superconducting order parameter @xmath7 which distinction holds for @xmath8 , both above and below @xmath3 .",
    "the difference parameter ( or pseudogap energy scale ) @xmath9 can be associated with low energy , weakly damped , pair excitations of finite momentum .",
    "it is essential to note that our generalization of bcs theory is based on the _ particular _ ground state of the crossover problem@xcite : the leggett state ( @xmath10 ) , which has a bcs - like character but should be thought of as applicable to arbitrary values of the attractive coupling constant @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath11 are given by the usual bcs - like expressions in terms of the fermionic dispersion @xmath12 .",
    "the variational conditions which ensue from leggett s calculations are the same as those written below in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , for @xmath1 .",
    "we have shown , based on the work of kadanoff and martin@xcite ( km ) , that these self consistent equations can be derived from a green s function decoupling scheme .",
    "we stress here the three important but subtle observations of km : ( i ) to obtain bcs - like theories , it is sufficient to truncate the system of equations so that only one and two particle propagators enter and ( ii ) the correlation functions associated with this km scheme  at the level of the gap equations and thermodynamics  are _ not _ the same correlation functions which enter into the electrodynamical response .",
    "( iii ) the pair susceptibility @xmath13 which appears in the t - matrix , or pair propagator @xmath14 , is of the form @xmath15 ; this differs from other t - matrix schemes ( where , frequently , @xmath16 ) , but is required to obtain the bcs - like gap equations and their thermodynamics@xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that this ground state has 100% condensation for all @xmath0 , unlike that of the non - ideal bose gas .    without any detailed calculations ,",
    "we can anticipate the form of the generalized bcs theory , which applies below @xmath3@xcite . as expected by a natural extension of the leggett ground state variational conditions ( and , as is consistent with bcs theory ) we have @xmath17      & = & n\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath18 is the bare fermion dispersion , measured from the chemical potential @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the quasi - particle dispersion and @xmath21 represents the symmetry of the pairing state .",
    "the new physics of the pseudogap phase is embodied in a third equation which represents the difference of the two energy gap parameters in terms of the number of excited pairs ( with bose distribution @xmath22 ) , as @xmath23 where the coefficient of proportionality , @xmath24 , and the pair excitation energy , @xmath25 , can both be determined from the above microscopic theory .",
    "these calculations@xcite indicate that ( at small , but non - zero ( @xmath26 ) ) the pair propagator can be approximated by @xmath27\\ ] ] for the purposes of calculating the self energy @xmath28 of the fermions ( which self energy enters into the resulting gap equations and thermodynamics ) .",
    "one can interpret this theoretical approach as follows . here",
    "we go beyond bcs to include self energy @xmath28 effects associated with the incoherent , finite @xmath29 pair excitations . _ whereas , bcs is a mean field treatment of the particles , the present approach should be thought of as a mean field treatment of the pairs_. this represents the next level in a hierarchy of ( superconducting ) mean field theories , which hierarchy is similar to that encountered in magnetic problems .",
    "this mean field approximation of the pairs is associated with the truncation of the equations of motion , so that pair - pair interactions are not directly present .",
    "residual inter - boson interactions arise only indirectly via the self energy of the fermions . as a consequence , both above and below @xmath3 , the pair dispersion is quadratic @xmath30 , as in a quasi - ideal bose gas . in this way , as in the km paper , the pair correlation function is to be distinguished from that associated with the collective modes of the order parameter@xcite .",
    "the results summarized here represent those deduced from solving the coupled equations@xcite for the pair propagator @xmath31 and its single particle analogue ( @xmath32 ) , along with the fermionic number constraint .",
    "_ pseudogap onset : _ in our earliest work@xcite we found that the temperature @xmath33 at which the fermi liquid state first breaks down corresponds to the onset of a splitting of the single peaked ( broadened fermi liquid - like ) electronic spectral function into two peaks separated by a ( pseudo)gap . this pseudogap state is characterized by the presence of metastable pairs or  resonances \" which effectively reduce the single particle density of states .",
    "near , but above @xmath3 , the latter takes the form of a broadened bcs - like structure . moreover , between @xmath3 and @xmath33 , the wave - vector dependence of @xmath28 ( and of the pseudogap ) departs from that of a strict @xmath21 symmetry@xcite .",
    "note , also , that in the present approach we always have @xmath34 .",
    "_ superconducting transition : _ as the temperature decreases from @xmath33 , the density of meta - stable pairs with momentum @xmath35 continues to increase , until at @xmath36 , a macroscopic fraction with @xmath37 undergoes bose condensation . at this temperature ,",
    "the pair propagator or t - matrix diverges as expected from the thouless criterion , so that both @xmath38 and @xmath39 vanish .",
    "moreover , near @xmath3 , the inverse lifetime of the @xmath40 pairs , as well as that associated with fermion states @xmath41 becomes very small@xcite .",
    "this is an important set of observations .",
    "once the vicinity of @xmath3 is reached , the interaction between the long wavelength ( soft ) bosons and the ( gapped ) fermions becomes weak .",
    "this same behavior continues to hold below @xmath3 so that to leading order , lifetime effects can be dropped in eqs .",
    "( 1)-(3 ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath0 which results from eqs ( 1)-(3 ) is highly non - monotonic , even for the @xmath42-wave case@xcite . at low @xmath0",
    ", the curve for @xmath3 vs @xmath0 follows the bcs result until @xmath43 becomes sufficiently large ; then @xmath3 decreases , with @xmath0 , thereby reflecting the difficulty of forming a superconducting state in the presence of a fermionic gap .",
    "once @xmath19 becomes negative , @xmath3 then increases with increasing @xmath0 approaching a ( mass ) renormalized , but otherwise ideal bec limit . for the @xmath4-wave case ,",
    "the situation is even more complex@xcite . as a result of the extended size of the @xmath4-wave pairs ,",
    "the effects of the pauli principle repulsion are more extreme , and @xmath3 vanishes well before the system reaches the @xmath44 limit ( except in the limit of unphysically small densities ) . in strictly @xmath45 , we find @xmath3 is always zero",
    ".    _ behavior of the superconducting gap equations : _ equations ( 1)-(3 ) were solved to yield the results plotted in figure 1 , for the case of weak , moderate and large @xmath0 .",
    "also indicated is a  cartoon \" characterizing the excitations of the condensate at each value of @xmath0 . above @xmath3 , where the computations are more complicated we used a simple extrapolation procedure@xcite to facilitate the numerics . as can be seen from the figure and from eq .",
    "( 3 ) , as the number of excited pair states increases , so does the difference between the fermionic excitation gap and the order parameter .",
    "these figures represent a natural generalization of bcs theory .    _ thermodynamical consequences ; mostly @xmath46 : _ the pair excitations shown schematically in figure 1 necessarily lead to corrections to the quasi - particle - derived thermodynamics of bcs theory , via new low @xmath47 power laws .",
    "indeed , it would be difficult to imagine how fermionic quasi - particles could be relevant to the thermodynamics of the bec limit .",
    "that these excited pair states have a nearly ideal bose gas character is a consequence of the bcs - like , leggett ground state ; they arise from a mean field treatment of the pair propagator .",
    "one might imagine an improved approach to the strong coupling limit ( which includes direct pair - pair interactions ) would lead to results which are more analogous to those of the non - ideal bose gas .",
    "it should , however , be noted that the cuprates are in the clear fermionic regime where @xmath19 is essentially @xmath48 , as is consistent with our calculations@xcite .",
    "moreover , for the @xmath4-wave case , our analysis shows that the bec limit is virtually inaccessible , and concerns about inaccuracies of the km approach , in this limit , appear to be less relevant .",
    "what is most important is to properly capture the physics of the bcs regime , so that small excursions from it can be considered in a controlled manner . as a result of these pair excitations , in a quasi-2d system such as the cuprates we find@xcite @xmath49 . at this time",
    ", a low @xmath47 , linear specific heat contribution is well documented in the cuprates , although it is not known whether it is intrinsic or extrinsic . elsewhere in this journal@xcite",
    ", we compare our quantitative calculations for @xmath46 with experiment .",
    "-1.8 mm    we have not yet completed a full calculation of the thermodynamical properties such as @xmath46 from above to below @xmath3 .",
    "nevertheless , it can be anticipated on physical grounds that @xmath50 starts to decrease once @xmath33 is reached and that the overall behavior of that contribution to @xmath46 which is associated with the fermionic degrees of freedom , is rather similar to that of a much - broadened bcs theory above @xmath3 . _",
    "the density of states is depleted precisely at @xmath48 , once the temperature passes below @xmath3_. this long range order - induced depletion , is , thereby , reflected in thermodynamical properties , such as @xmath46 jumps which become progressively weaker the stronger the coupling @xmath0 .",
    "_ behavior of the penetration depth : _ we find@xcite , that the penetration depth at low @xmath47 , behaves as @xmath51 . here",
    "the second and third terms represent respectively the fermionic quasi - particle and the bosonic contributions",
    ". this additional @xmath52 bosonic contribution may be difficult to distinguish from the  dirty \" @xmath4-wave @xmath53 term , which was previously invoked in fits to the data , at the lowest @xmath47 .",
    "a quantitative discussion of this term is given elsewhere in this journal@xcite , along with comparisons to the data .",
    "[ the hole concentration ( @xmath54 ) dependence must be also addressed , as will be summarized below ] .",
    "it should be stressed that this bosonic term is responsible for the quasi - universal scaling of the penetration depth@xcite , which we have reported .",
    "indeed , our calculations indicate that there are systematic deviations from perfect scaling , and the general trends for these deviations appear to have been observed by the cambridge group@xcite .",
    "the present approach should be contrasted with the  @xmath4-wave nodal quasiparticle \" picture ( in its fermi liquid rendition@xcite ) where landau parameters @xmath55 are thought to be important below @xmath3 . in the present context , these @xmath55 effects are not as primary as is incorporating the new ( non fermi - liquid ) physics of the pseudogap state .",
    "ultimately landau effects can be added here , as elsewhere , for detailed fits to data .",
    "_ phase diagram : _ in order to incorporate the mott insulator constraint , the band - width or alternatively @xmath56 must be fit to the @xmath54-dependence of the zero temperature penetration depth@xcite . in the absence of any detailed information about the source of the pairing attraction @xmath0 ( which presumably derives from coulomb interactions@xcite in some direct or indirect form , in the @xmath4-wave channel ) ,",
    "we assume that @xmath0 is @xmath54-independent and fit its ratio to the  bare bandwidth \" via one adjustable parameter , which is chosen to optimize agreement with the entire phase diagram@xcite . with this transcription",
    ", one can see that the ratio of @xmath0 to the effective fermi energy must increase as the insulator is approached , so that the bosonic degrees of freedom become more evident with underdoping .",
    "this prescription provides a quite good fit to @xmath57 over the entire range of @xmath54 .",
    "it also can be used as a  tool \" for addressing the @xmath54 and @xmath47 dependence of a wide collection of experimental data , including the critical current @xmath58 , knight shift and nmr relaxation rate@xcite .",
    "all of these can be written in terms of the contributions from  three fluids \" : the condensate ( via @xmath7 ) , the fermionic excitations ( via @xmath6 ) , and the pair excitations ( via @xmath59 , or @xmath43 ) .",
    "_ neutron scattering and relation to condensation energy : _ elsewhere@xcite , and in this journal@xcite we have shown that the incommensurate and commensurate peaks in the neutron cross section can be interpreted as reflecting the @xmath4-wave superconducting gap . moreover , above @xmath3 , the pseudogap will lead to a residue of these peaks , albeit broadened . within the present picture",
    "the neutron resonance ( commensurate structure ) and the behavior of the specific heat with its discontinuity at and around @xmath3 are both consequences of the same underlying pseudogap physics , but _ not _ directly of each other .",
    "moreover , in contrast to bcs theory , where one can extrapolate the zero field normal state to estimate the condensation energy , here we find that because of the non - fermi liquid nature of the normal state ( and its instability at @xmath3 ) such extrapolations are problematical .",
    "this ( along with other features , such as coherent and incoherent contributions to arpes and tunneling , and general finite magnetic field effects on the pseudogap ) will be discussed in more detail in future work .",
