    "stockmayer fluids @xcite have long been studied as models for fluids with permanent dipoles , such as water , ammonia , or methyl chloride .",
    "thermodynamic properties for these fluids have been calculated by theory and simulations .",
    "attempts have been made to model real dipolar fluids by fitting potential parameters of stockmayer fluids .",
    "rowlinson @xcite fitted experimental second virial coefficients to theoretically calculated ones to find stockmayer potential parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 for some dipolar fluids .",
    "van leeuwen @xcite fitted experimental coexistence curves to results from computer simulations .",
    "agreement between the stockmayer potential parameters calculated from second virial coefficients and phase coexistence data is only qualitative .",
    "one of the reasons why the agreement is not quantitative is that fitting of the second virial coefficient gives the parameters for the fluid at the limit of zero density while fitting of the coexistence curve gives the parameters for the dense fluid .",
    "the interaction of dipolar molecules can significantly change depending on the density or temperature due to the redistribution of electron density within a molecule in response to changes in the molecular environment ( electrostatic induction effect ) .",
    "it is essential to account for this effect when phase coexistence properties of dipolar fluids are calculated because electrostatic induction is much stronger in the liquid phase than in the gas phase , and molecular interactions can not be accurately modeled by the same ( non - polarizable ) model and parameters for both phases .",
    "one way to include the electrostatic induction effect on a model of polar fluids is to introduce polarizability .",
    "wertheim @xcite has studied the effect of polarizability on thermodynamic properties by using a graph - theoretical approach .",
    "his renormalization perturbation theory @xcite was then extended to mixtures by venkatasubramanian et al .",

    "@xcite performed monte carlo simulations to test the free energy calculation by wertheim s theory for hard spheres with moderately large reduced dipoles @xmath5 1.0 ( where @xmath6 is the permanent dipole moment ) and reduced mean polarizabilities of @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is boltzmann constant , @xmath9 is the absolute temperature , @xmath10 is the hard sphere diameter and @xmath11 is polarizability ) .",
    "venkatasubramanian et al .",
    "compared theoretically calculated coexistence properties with experiment @xcite for stockmayer fluids with reduced dipoles of @xmath12 and reduced polarizabilities of @xmath13 ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the lennard - jones parameters ) .",
    "the results of these studies agree reasonably well with wertheim s theory .",

    "@xcite performed gibbs ensemble monte carlo simulations of coexistence properties for non - polarizable stockmayer fluids .",
    "however , simulation studies of the coexistence properties of polarizable stockmayer fluids have not been previously published to our knowledge .    in this paper , we present results from grand canonical monte carlo ( gcmc ) simulations of stockmayer fluids with and without polarizability for the vapor- liquid phase coexistence properties .",
    "the results are compared to the renormalization perturbation theory by wertheim @xcite .",
    "we study the models with reduced dipoles of @xmath0 1.0 and 2.0 and reduced polarizabilities of @xmath140.00 , 0.03 , and 0.06 .",
    "examples of estimates of the parameters for real fluids are @xmath0 1.84 and @xmath140.08 for water @xcite and @xmath0 1.03 and @xmath140.06 for methyl chloride @xcite . since applications of the histogram reweighting method to phase coexistence of fluids have only recently started appearing@xcite , we begin this paper by discussing the principle of the method and issues related to its practical application to predict phase coexistence curves at temperatures significantly below the critical point .",
    "deviations between theory and simulation results for the coexistence envelope are near 2% for the lower dipole moment and 10 % for the higher dipole moment studied .",
    "determination of phase coexistence by monte carlo simulation requires either implicit or explicit calculation of the free energy of a system .",
    "the gibbs ensemble method @xcite is used for determination of phase equilibrium by implicitly minimizing the total free energy of the system , which is separated into two phases .",
    "non - boltzmann sampling methods ( such as thermodynamic scaling ) @xcite and the test particle insertion method @xcite are among the methods for explicit calculation of free energy of the system .",
    "ferrenberg and swendsen @xcite proposed the use of the distribution of energy and density calculated in grand canonical monte carlo ( gcmc ) simulations .",
    "we refer to this method as `` the histogram reweighting method . ''",
    "the method has rarely been applied to continuous - space fluids , with the exception of a recent study by wilding for the lennard - jones fluid @xcite .",
    "we chose the histogram reweighting method for this study because we found it to be computationally more efficient than the other available methods for our systems .",
    "one of the attractive features of the histogram reweighting method is that it can be used to construct the grand canonical partition function , which in turn can be used to obtain all thermodynamic properties , including the free energy or coexistence properties .",
    "moreover , a single simulation at a given chemical potential @xmath15 and temperature @xmath9 can give the thermodynamic properties at a range of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , by virtue of the scaling properties in the variables ( see section on `` theoretical basis '' below ) .",
    "in calculating coexistence properties , it is not necessary to observe phase coexistence in a single gcmc simulation , since they are calculated by analyzing the grand canonical partition function constructed by combining the histograms .",
    "gcmc simulation is appropriate for calculating thermodynamic properties for a range of densities for molecular fluids , because it does not require computationally expensive volume changes .",
    "the polarizable stockmayer potential does not scale simply with volume .",
    "the basic concept behind the histogram reweighting method of ferrenberg and swendsen @xcite for gcmc simulations is reviewed here .",

    "then , we can calculate the thermodynamic properties at the new state ( @xmath16 , @xmath18 , @xmath17 ) by averaging a thermodynamic variable with the reweighted components of the grand canonical partition function .",

    "the constant @xmath30 , which is unknown , but can be determined as described below , is unimportant in averaging a property @xmath32 as in equation [ x ] because it cancels out in the numerator and the denominator .      in the grand canonical ensemble at a sub - critical temperature , the vapor - liquid coexistence can be determined by finding the chemical potential that gives the same pressure for both phases .",
    "we define the pressure @xmath38 at a thermodynamic state ( @xmath15 , @xmath18 , @xmath9 ) by    @xmath39    if a histogram is made for a thermodynamic state ( @xmath15 , @xmath18 , @xmath9 ) , the pressure at ( @xmath16 , @xmath18 , @xmath17 ) is calculated by    @xmath40 \\cdot \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{prs2 } \\cdot f_{\\mu , v , t}(n , u_n ) \\cdot c \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where equations [ pf ] and [ prs1 ] are used . at a subcritical temperature , the pressure of each phase",
    "is thus calculated except for the constant @xmath30 .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath16 that gives the same pressure for both phases is then found , and the phase coexistence thus determined .",
    "when it is necessary to calculate the absolute value of the partition function , the simulation specific constant @xmath30 needs to be determined by a different means . in this study ,",
    "the absolute value of the constant @xmath30 is fixed by calculating the pressure in the original simulation using the virial theorem @xmath41 and equating that with the pressure calculated by equation [ prs2 ] .",
    "calculation of the thermodynamic properties at vapor - liquid coexistence requires the histogram over a wide range of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "however , it is difficult to get @xmath29 with good statistical accuracy over a wide range of @xmath21 and @xmath22 from one simulation . in the method by norman and filinov @xcite or in any metropolis scheme @xcite ,",
    "the configurations relevant to the given thermodynamic state ( @xmath15 , @xmath18 , @xmath9 ) are preferentially sampled and those relevant to other states are not sampled well .",
    "therefore , we perform several simulations at different thermodynamic states and combine the information to construct the histogram @xmath29 , which is then given with good accuracy over a wide range of @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in the initial attempts to sample a wide range of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , we perform gcmc simulations at a temperature slightly above the critical point with various chemical potentials . the details are described in section 5 .    combining two simulation results",

    "the simpler method described above was found to be satisfactory for our systems .",
    "both the gcmc histogram reweighting method and the gibbs ensemble method @xcite can be used to obtain the coexistence properties of a system such as the polarizable stockmayer fluid of the present study . at first sight",
    ", it would seem that the gibbs ensemble method is simpler to implement , as it requires only a single simulation per temperature at which coexistence is to be determined , rather than the series of simulations required by the gcmc histogram method . to determine the complete phase diagram at a series of temperatures both methods require several simulations .",
    "however , we have found that statistical uncertainties for the coexistence properties from the gcmc method seem to be significantly smaller than for a gibbs - ensemble determination of the phase behavior for comparable amounts of computational time expenditure .",
    "this statement is supported by the small statistical uncertainties of the coexistence properties calculated in tables iii and iv , which would have required prohibitively long gibbs ensemble calculations .",
    "a molecule of a stockmayer fluid is a lennard - jones interaction site with an embedded point dipole at the center of the molecule . for polarizable models ,",
    "polarizability is introduced also at the center of the molecule @xcite .",
    "assuming that the induced dipole moment is linearly dependent on the local electric field at the center of the molecule , the total dipole moment of molecule @xmath43 is written as    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the total dipole moment , @xmath46 is the permanent dipole moment , @xmath47 is the local electric field at the center of the molecule , and @xmath48 is the polarizability tensor . the local electric field is calculated as @xcite    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the dipole tensor for molecules @xmath43 and @xmath51 .",

    "details of the iterative procedure are discussed in the next section .",
    "throughout this study , data are presented in the reduced units , denoted by the superscript ( * ) .",
    "the units of energy and length are reduced by the lennard - jones parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "reduced temperature is @xmath61 .",
    "dipole moment ( @xmath62 ) and polarizability ( @xmath48 ) are reduced by the lennard - jones parameters as @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we study stockmayer fluids with permanent dipole moments @xmath65 1.0 and 2.0 and isotropic polarizabilities @xmath1 0.00 , 0.03 , and 0.06 .    in gcmc simulations , at each monte carlo step , a new microstate is generated by a displacement , rotation , and creation or destruction of a molecule .",
    "the state thus generated is probabilistically accepted so that the limiting distribution of generated microstates obeys the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "we use 10% of the monte carlo moves for displacement , 10% for rotation , 40% for creation , and 40% for destruction . in the energy calculation of polarizable models , the total interaction of the system is calculated by an iterative procedure @xcite described below .",
    "the initial values of properties for a configuration are indicated by ( 0 ) , and the estimates for those properties at the k - th iteration by ( k ) . when a molecule is either displaced , rotated , created or destroyed , the initial estimate of the electric field at the center of molecule @xmath43 is    @xmath66    then , the first estimate of the total dipole mement of molecule i is    @xmath67    and the total electrostatic interaction is    @xmath68    this way , the k - th estimates of the electric field , the dipole mement , and the dipole - dipole interaction are    @xmath69    respectively .",
    "this procedure is repeated until @xmath70 is converged so that @xmath71 for two consecutive iterations",
    ". typically , the number of iterations required for this criterion at each monte carlo move turns out to be 3 to 4 for polarizability of @xmath1 0.03 and 3 to 6 for @xmath1 0.06 ( see tables 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the initial value of dipole moment of molecule @xmath72 at each monte carlo step is chosen to be the dipole moment before the move , except for a newly inserted molecule for which the dipole moment is chosen to be the same as the permanent dipole moment .",
    "the dipole points to a random direction for a newly inserted molecule . in order to minimize the size effect for the dipole - dipole interaction , we use the ewald sum with 256 vectors for the reciprocal space terms @xcite for the model with @xmath65 1.0 and @xmath1 0.00 , and 514 vectors for the other models that we study .",
    "approximate overall cpu - time per monte carlo step for the polarizable models is 2 times slower for @xmath1 0.03 and 2.4 times slower for @xmath1 0.06 than the cpu - time for @xmath1 0.00 by our code designed for polarizable models with the ewald sum .",
    "simulations of non - polarizable models by our code for polarizable models are , in turn , approximately 4 times slower than those by our code specifically designed for non - polarizable models , because the energy calculation of polarizable models requires the calculation of the local electric field of each molecule .",
    "when two polarizable molecules approach unphysically close to each other during simulation , the electrostatic attraction increases faster than the repulsive part of the lennard - jones potential due to the increasing magnitude of the total dipoles and eventually the two molecules overlap @xcite . in order to avoid this effect",
    ", we set a saturation point of the total dipole equal to twice the magnitude of the permanent dipole .",
    "this treatment seems to be reasonable because the average of the total dipole moment is far smaller than twice the magnitude of the permanent dipole in each of the simulations we performed ( see tables 1 and 2 ) . for the lennard - jones interaction ,",
    "the potential is cut off at half of the simulation box length and the standard long range correction is applied @xcite .    during the simulations ,",
    "the number of observations of a given number of particles and energy is counted and the two dimensional histogram @xmath29 is made .",
    "the grid of the histogram for energy is chosen to be 0.01 in the reduced unit .",
    "the two dimensional histograms of the number of particles and the energy are analyzed to obtain coexistence properties for a range of temperature by the method described in section 2 .    in most simulations ,",
    "the volume is chosen to be @xmath73=216 . for simulations of low densities ,",
    "the volume is chosen to be @xmath73=2160 so that the simulation box can accommodate a large enough number of particles to measure a density difference as small as @xmath74 \\simeq $ ] 0.0005 . in combining the histograms of simulations of different volumes ,",
    "we rescale the histogram for @xmath73=2160 to that for @xmath73=216 assuming    @xmath75    or , in terms of the component of the histogram , @xmath76    which is a reasonable assumption away from the critical point , since the logarithms of the microcanonical and canonical partition functions are extensive properties of the system .",
    "to fix the simulation specific constant @xmath30 , we use the pressure calculated by the virial theorem in one of the simulations in the gas phase .",
    "the derivative of energy in terms of volume is calculated by an approximation ,    @xmath77    the @xmath78 is chosen to be about 3% of the volume @xmath18 . the energy @xmath79 is calculated every time a monte carlo move is accepted .    for each model , we first estimate the approximate location of the critical point by looking up literature values for similar models @xcite and by performing several short test simulations .",
    "then , we perform a series of gcmc simulations at a temperature slightly above the critical temperature for various chemical potentials to sample a wide range of density .",
    "the reasons why we choose a temperature slightly above the critical temperature are that large density fluctuations near the critical point make it easier to sample a wide range of density in a single simulation and that for subcritical temperatures the system tends to fluctuate infrequently between the gas and liquid densities , making sampling of both phases difficult .",
    "an example is illustrated in figure 1 for the model with @xmath80 and @xmath81 . at @xmath82=1.5",
    ", we performed gcmc simulations with various chemical potentials ( @xmath83 ) to cover the density range of interest .",
    "the mean densities calculated from these simulations are shown in figure 1 by circles .",
    "the coexistence properties for a range of temperatures ( @xmath84 for this example ) are calculated from these simulation results .    in order to make sure that the simulations are sampling the configurations relevant to the phase equilibrium properties , we performed a new series of simulations with temperatures and chemical potentials that are near the corresponding properties at phase coexistence for temperatures lower than the temperature for the first simulations ( @xmath82=1.0 , 1.1 , 1.2 , and 1.3 ) .",
    "the chemical potentials for these simulations are chosen to be the values at coexistence estimated from the first simulation results for each temperature .",

    "the fitting of the calculated coexistence densities to the law of rectilinear diameters and a scaling law , assuming that dipolar fluids obey the ising exponent ( @xmath85 ) , is shown in figure 1 by dashed line .",
    "we performed five sets of simulations and analyses .",
    "the length of each gcmc simulation was 1 million monte carlo steps .",
    "the averages and the error - bars were calculated from the five sets of data . for error - bars ,",
    "we use the square root of the variance of mean .",
    "thus calculated error - bars are not , in a strict sense , statistical errors because there are several sources of statistical errors that propagate to the final results : for example , the thermodynamic states of interest here are not sampled an exactly equal number of times in the simulations .",
    "however , they are still good estimates of the reliability of the simulations and the data analysis .",
    "as we can see in figure 1 , the mean densities of the second series of simulations ( squares ) agree well with the final results ( dashed line ) .",
    "since the chemical potentials in the second series of simulations are based on the estimates from the first simulations ( circles ) , it turns out that the estimates of coexistence densities from the first simulations are fairly accurate , considering that all the simulations were performed at one temperature ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the magnitude of the average total dipole moment and the number of iterations necessary for the convergence of the energy calculation , with the criterion given in the previous section , are listed for polarizable models along with the conditions used for the original gcmc simulations in tables 1 and 2 .",

    "examples of the probability density distributions from the gcmc simulations are shown in figure 2 for the stockmayer fluid with @xmath91 and @xmath92 . by reweighting and combining the histograms obtained from the simulations ,",
    "we get the density distribution for any temperature and chemical potential . examples of the density distributions at coexistence are shown in figure 3 for the stockmayer fluid with @xmath91 and @xmath92 . because of the small system size of the simulations , the two peaks in the density distribution at coexistence overlap far below the critical temperature .",
    "we calculate the coexistence properties up to the temperature where the two peaks start to overlap .",

    "our results seem to indicate a slight increase in the critical density at higher polarizabilities , but the differences are comparable to the statistical uncertainties of the calculations . the calculated coexistence density , pressure , and heat of vaporization are compared with the renormalization perturbation theory by wertheim figures 4 to 9 . for the theoretical calculation , we follow the prescription given by venkatasubramanian et al . @xcite and use the equation of state by johnson et al . @xcite and the coefficients of the pair and triplet correlation functions calculated by flytzani - stephanopoulos et al .",
