    "the new narrow emission line at @xmath03.55  kev reported in february 2014 from different stacks of galaxy clusters  @xcite , the andromeda galaxy and the perseus galaxy cluster  @xcite , still remains unexplained , see reviews  @xcite for details .",
    "although the standard astrophysical explanation due to enhanced k  xviii emission lines at @xmath03.51  kev proposed in  @xcite remains possible  @xcite , subsequent measurements of the new line strength in the galactic centre  @xcite and in the nearby dark matter - dominated galaxy clusters  @xcite argue for physics beyond the standard model , presumably in a form of radiatively decaying dark matter . further studies with future high - resolution imaging spectrometers , such as soft x - ray spectrometer ( sxs ) on - board forthcoming _",

    "mission  @xcite and _ micro - x _ sounding rocket experiment  @xcite will be able to determine the line origin  @xcite in the nearest future .",
    "selection of the best follow - up targets is in progress . according to  @xcite ,",
    "european cosmic imaging camera ( epic )  @xcite on - board _ xmm - newton _  cosmic mission  @xcite is the most sensitive existing instrument in order to search the narrow faint x - ray line .",
    "recent measurement reported in  @xcite based on archival _ xmm - newton_/epic data on galaxy clusters with the largest expected decaying dark matter signal doubles the number of the new line detections compared with table  1 in  @xcite .",
    "the result reported in  @xcite encourages to further search for the @xmath03.55  kev line .",
    "an example of the dataset to explore is the _ xmm - newton_/epic sky map of  @xcite what contains about 4000 individual observations ( 80  ms of cleaned exposure ) by the epic / mos cameras of _ xmm - newton_.    because detailed analysis of thousands of individual objects becomes extremely challenging task , in this paper we propose the selection procedure of potential @xmath03.55  kev line targets based on wavelet analysis .",
    "usually , wavelets in astrophysics are used for point sources detection  @xcite and periodicity analysis  @xcite , but they can also be used for search of local spectral inhomogeneities . as a simplified idea , we consider continuous spectrum with narrow line centered on bin @xmath2 with flux @xmath3 in @xmath4-th energy bin . by calculating flux residuals with respect to adjacent bins ,",
    "@xmath5 we note that continuum contribution will roughly cancel while the line component localized in @xmath4-th bin will not .",
    "sliding along the spectral range of our interest and calculating the largest @xmath6 , one can determine the line position @xmath7 . another important quantity  line significance @xmath8 ",
    "can be estimated as @xmath9 its generalization on arbitrary wavelet function @xmath10 is straightforward : @xmath11    for our analysis , we used 2 types of wavelet functions @xmath12 :    * step function wavelet @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is heaviside function , @xmath15 is the width of the wavelet ) used in eq .",
    "[ eq : step - function ] , see fig .",
    "[ fig : stepwl ] ; * `` mexican hat '' wavelet @xmath16 see fig .",
    "[ fig : mhwl ] .    in practice ,",
    "using wavelet method should decrease the significance of the detected line .",
    "the reasons are the presence of non - negligible instrumental emission lines ( such as potassium k@xmath17 line at 3.31  kev and calcium k@xmath17 line at 3.69  kev ) , complexes of astrophysical lines emitted by hot plasma ( see e.g. table  1 in  @xcite ) and significant distorsions of _ xmm - newton_/mos effective area in the region of our interest . to test the sensitivity of our technique",
    ", we have simulated 5000 independent realizations of _ xmm - newton_/mos spectra of the andromeda galaxy where the line was already detected  @xcite .",
    "the simulations were performed using standard command ` fakeit ` inside the ` xspec ` spectral fitting package .",
    "the model parameters are set equal to best - fit model parameters of real m31 spectra seen by _ xmm - newton_/mos cameras  @xcite .",
    "the new emission line was included in a ` fakeit ` simulation model as a narrow ` gaussian ` model with different intensities . for each simulation , we first modeled the obtained spectrum in ` xspec ` and derived the new line significance @xmath18 using ` xspec ` procedure ` steppar ` .",
    "for 2 extra degrees of freedom ( position and flux of the narrow line ) added to our model , the value of @xmath18 and the corresponding local @xmath19-value ( the probability of observing the extra line at @xmath03.5  kev at least as extreme as that observed in simulated spectrum , given its absence in model spectra used for simulations , see e.g.  @xcite ) can be expressed through @xmath20  the decrease of @xmath21 statistics when adding a narrow ` gaussian ` line in ` xspec ` spectral package : @xmath22 after that , we processed the obtained spectrum using the wavelet procedure described above and derived the largest value of our wavelet paramater @xmath8 among the values of the line position @xmath7 within the energy range 3.45 - 3.60  kev . to do that , we used step function wavelet with the bin width @xmath23  ev and the `` mexican hat '' wavelet with @xmath24  ev .",
    "the obtained relation between the line significance @xmath18 and the value of our wavelet parameter @xmath8 for step function and `` mexican hat '' wavelets is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : stwsign120 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : mhwsign60 ] , respectively .",
    "the resulting @xmath19-value for @xmath25 line detection with our step function wavelet ( calculated by similar simulations with no extra line added ) is 0.094 corresponding to approximately 1.7@xmath26 local significance .",
    "this means that wavelet method , despite its simplicity , is able to recover 3@xmath26 narrow lines at 1.7@xmath26 significance .",
    "the `` mexican hat '' wavelet shows slightly better results ( @xmath19-value is 0.082 ) but is much more time consuming , so for our quicklook analysis the step function wavelet is sufficient .",
    "we analyzed all _ xmm - newton_/mos observations used in x - ray sky maps  @xcite in order to search the extra narrow line at @xmath27  kev is allowed to vary within 3.45 - 3.60  kev range .",
    "] using step function wavelet with @xmath23  ev described above .",
    "the format of sky maps allowed us to combine all data from the same sky regions ( 25 @xmath28 25 squares , roughly corresponding to _ xmm - newton_/mos field - of - view ) .",
    "we selected all the data where the new line was detected at @xmath29 ( corresponding in average to @xmath30 local significance , according to the best - fit line in fig .",
    "[ fig : stwsign120 ] ) .",
    "the resulting list of 235 spatial regions is shown in table  [ tab : detection - pixels ] .",
