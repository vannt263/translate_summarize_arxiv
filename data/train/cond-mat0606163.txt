    "strontium ruthenate is an intriguing low t@xmath2 superconductor @xcite .",
    "it is widely believed to have spin triplet order parameter .",
    "the orbital symmetry of it , however , is still unknown .",
    "knight shift @xcite and spin susceptibility @xcite being constant below @xmath4 point to the chiral state with d - vector @xmath5 .",
    "this state ( called ( a ) in the following ) is also consistent with the @xmath6-sr experiments which show spontaneous time reversal symmetry breaking at @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it was recently confirmed in phase sensitive experiments @xcite .",
    "the original knight shift measurements were performed for magnetic fields aligned in the ruthenate a - b plane .",
    "recently the knight shift @xcite has been measured in magnetic field parallel to the c - axis . in contradiction to expectations it was found that the susceptibility is _ also unchanged _ from the normal state value below @xmath4 .",
    "it was noted@xcite that this result would be consistent with the assumption that the @xmath7 vector rotates away from the @xmath8 direction under the influence of the external field .",
    "however a simple rotated state , such as @xmath9 , is not allowed in tetragonal symmetry . instead , the symmetry allowed states @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( which below we refer to as @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively ) would also explain the data as the spin susceptibility for either of these states is of the form @xcite @xmath14 corresponding to a constant spin susceptibility for c - axis fields consistent with the results of murakawa _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to study in some detail the scenario of d - vector rotation in the c - axis magnetic field .",
    "specifically , we shall study the possible effect of the weak external ( zeeman only ) magnetic field on the symmetry of the lowest energy pairing state .    to this end",
    "we use a recently proposed @xcite phenomenological three - band , three dimensional model with a realistic band structure @xcite .",
    "it takes into account the three ruthenium @xmath15 orbitals @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the hopping integrals @xmath19 for orbitals @xmath20 and @xmath21 and ru sites @xmath22 and @xmath23 as well as the site energies @xmath24 are fitted to reproduce the experimentally determined fermi surface @xcite .",
    "the effective spin and orbital dependent attractive hubbard parameters @xmath25 are chosen to give correct transition temperature . without spin - orbit coupling the model with only two values of interaction parameters : an in - plane @xmath26 and out - of - plane @xmath27 results in the chiral state @xmath28 , as the ground state of the system .",
    "for spin - independent interactions the alternative pairing states @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the ground state for any value of @xmath29 . to get the state ( a ) as the ground state in the presence of non - zero spin - orbit interaction @xmath30 one has to take into account that the spin - orbit coupling leads to a small spin dependence of the effective pairing interaction @xcite .",
    "choosing @xmath31 about 1% larger than @xmath32 is sufficient to stabilize the chiral state even for large spin orbit coupling .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the free energies of the @xmath28 @xmath12 and @xmath13 symmetry pairing states as a function of external magnetic field @xmath33 .",
    "the model parameters were chosen to make the chiral state @xmath28 stable at zero field .",
    "one can see that the chiral phase increases its free energy as the field is increased , until at a certain critical field the @xmath12 or @xmath13 solutions become more stable .",
    "therefore we expect a `` spin flop '' type phase transition from a d - vector oriented along the @xmath34-axis to one where the d - vector lies in the @xmath35 plane .",
    "a similar rotation is observed in the bulk superfluid state of @xmath36-a where the d - vector rotates continuously to remain perpendicular to the applied field @xcite .    in the case of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1",
    "the transition is not simply a rotation of the chiral d - vector but is also a transition from a chiral to non - chiral pairing state of different symmetry .",
    "the two distinct solutions shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] ( note that @xmath12 and @xmath13 are essentially degenerate ) have different entropies , as shown in the figure inset , and hence this freedericksz - like @xcite spin - flop is a first order thermodynamic phase transition . it has not yet been observed , because the specific heat jump at this transition is very small in comparison with the main jump at 1.5k , as our ( unpublished ) calculations indicate .",
