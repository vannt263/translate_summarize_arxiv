    "the wave function of a system of identical fermions must be completely antisymmetric upon exchange of particles .",
    "this is a rule of quantum statistics and is independent of the hamiltonian .",
    "the simplest kind of wave function satisfying this rule is the slater determinant @xcite : for an @xmath0-fermion system , take @xmath0 orthogonal ( or at least , linearly independent ) orbitals and put one particle in each orbital .",
    "after antisymmetrization , the total wave function can be written in the compact form of the determinant of a @xmath3 matrix , formed by the @xmath0 orbitals . by construction ,",
    "a slater determinant state is a tensor product state conforming to the antisymmetry rule .",
    "it is therefore legitimate to consider them as non - correlated or least - correlated states @xcite for a fermionic system .",
    "slater determinant states are simple and serve as the building blocks ( basis states ) of the multi - fermion hilbert space .",
    "but in a generic system with particle - particle interaction , the wave function ( e.g. , the ground state ) is generally not a slater determinant .",
    "that is , given the wave function , one can not put it in the form of a slater determinant , no matter which single - particle orbitals one choose .",
    "an immediate question is then , whether for a given wave function ( say , solved exactly by numerics ) , one can construct a slater determinant closest to it in a certain sense .",
    "a natural measure of distance or proximity , without reference to any physical quantity , is the overlap ( inner product ) between the given wave function and the slater determinant .",
    "if the overlap is close to unity , it is plausible to say that the particles are only weakly correlated , though it does not necessarily mean the system is strongly correlated if the overlap is small .",
    "this question can be generalized .",
    "presumably , in certain systems , the fermions may be so strongly correlated that a single slater determinant is not sufficient to approximate the wave function well .",
    "this means , one needs more orbitals than particles to have a bigger , multi - configuration subspace to approximate the given wave function .",
    "the question is then , how should we seek the @xmath4 orbitals , or more precisely , the @xmath5-dimensional single - particle subspace , since the multi - body hilbert space is determined by the subspace as a whole not by the individual orbitals ?",
    "several aspects of this problem are significant .",
    "first , like the celebrated `` @xmath0-representability '' problem @xcite , it touches on the fundamental problem of the fine structures of a multi - fermion wave function .",
    "second , it may provide a way to quantify the entanglement in a multi - fermion wave function , which is a topic currently under intensive study @xcite .",
    "third , it helps to better understand the algorithm of multi - configuration time - dependent hartree - fock ( mctdhf ) @xcite . in this algorithm ,",
    "the innovative idea is that the single - particle orbitals are not fixed but chosen adaptively , so that the number of orbitals needed to faithfully approximate a many - fermion wave function can be significantly reduced . in practice ,",
    "the time - evolving wave function is always approximated as a superposition of @xmath6 $ ] slater determinants constructed out of @xmath5 time - dependent orbitals .",
    "however the question remains how well the exact wave function can be approximated by using only @xmath5 orbitals .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a simple iterative algorithm as a numerical approach to this problem @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to fix all orbitals except for one and optimize it with respect to all other orbitals , and then do the same for the next orbital , and so on . in this process",
    ", the overlap increases monotonically , and since it is bounded from above by unity , it is certain to converge .",
    "the algorithm can be easily understood , implemented , and parallelized .",
    "a drawback is that there may exist local maxima .",
    "however , at least for the model studied below , there are not too many of them and by running the code several times with different initial values of the orbitals , the global maximum is likely to be found .    in the following ,",
    "we first present the algorithm in sec .",
    "[ algorithm ] , and then apply it to one - dimensional spinless fermions with nearest - neighbor interaction in sec .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "we study the convergence of the algorithm and the slater approximation of the ground state as well as time - evolved states .",
    "section [ conclusion ] contains a discussion of the advantages and limitations of the algorithm .",
    "we start with an @xmath0-fermion wave function @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 denotes all the degrees of freedom ( e.g. , position and spin ) of the @xmath9-th particle . in practice ,",
    "the model is often discretized , so that @xmath8 takes @xmath10 different values .",
    "the @xmath0-fermion hilbert space is then of dimension @xmath11 .",
    "the wave function must satisfy the anti - symmetry condition , i.e. , @xmath12 for an arbitrary pair @xmath13 .",
    "our aim is to find @xmath1 orthonormal single - particle orbitals @xmath14 , so that the projection of the wave function @xmath15 in the @xmath2-dimensional @xmath0-fermion subspace can be maximized ( the maximum does exist @xcite ) .",
    "the latter is spanned by the slater determinants @xmath16 here @xmath17 denotes an ordered @xmath0-tuple @xmath18 and the element of the matrix in the @xmath19th row and @xmath20th column is @xmath21 .",
    "an arbitrary normalized wave function in this subspace is of the form @xmath22 , with @xmath23 .",
    "the overlap between @xmath24 and the target state @xmath15 , the absolute value of which is to be maximized , is @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 by using the antisymmetry ( [ anti ] ) of @xmath15 .",
    "simple as it is , eq .",
    "( [ etaj ] ) is crucial for the algorithm below .",
    "the point is that on the right hand side , each orbital appears at most once . by the cauchy - schwarz inequality",
    ", we have @xmath27 . for a given set of orbitals @xmath28",
    ", the maximal value of @xmath29 is then @xmath30 .",
    "the problem is thus one of choosing the orbitals to maximize @xmath30 .    for this purpose ,",
    "let us first fix the orbitals @xmath31 , and try to find an optimal @xmath32 .",
    "we have @xmath33 where the single - particle function @xmath34 is defined as @xmath35 since the first term in ( [ twopart ] ) does not depend on @xmath32 while the second term does , the task is to maximize the second term in ( [ twopart ] ) under the constraint of @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath37 be the projection operator onto the subspace spanned by the orbitals @xmath31 .",
    "we have then @xmath38 here @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the eigenvector of @xmath41 corresponding to the largest eigenvalue is the optimal @xmath32 with respect to the given orbitals @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .    by optimizing @xmath32 ,",
    "@xmath30 has been increased .",
    "now the point is that , while @xmath32 is optimized with respect to @xmath42 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , orbital @xmath45 is _ not _ optimized with respect to @xmath32 , @xmath44 , @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , we can turn to @xmath45 and optimize it and this would increase @xmath30 again . in practice , we can make a circular shift @xmath47 after optimizing @xmath32 and optimize @xmath32 again . in this way , the value of @xmath30 increases monotonically and it will definitely converge since it is up bounded by unity .    technically , the most time - consuming part of the algorithm is calculating the @xmath48 s in ( [ gfun ] ) . in practice ,",
    "especially when the wave function is represented in second quantization , the value of @xmath15 is directly available only at points with @xmath49 . by using the anti - symmetry property of the function , the summation in ( [ gfun ] )",
    "can be converted into a form using only these points , @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the @xmath52 matrix formed by taking all the rows numbered @xmath53 except for the @xmath54-th row of the @xmath55 matrix @xmath56 $ ] . since the complexity of calculating the determinant is @xmath57 , the complexity of calculating one @xmath34 is @xmath58 .",
    "the scaling is not so good , but the summation over @xmath59 can be easily parallelized .",
    "the algorithm above simplifies in the special case of @xmath60 . in this case",
    ", there is only one @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath61 , and it is readily seen that @xmath34 is orthogonal to @xmath62 _ automatically _ due to the antisymmetry of @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , in this case , the optimal @xmath32 is simply proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath15 is a slater determinant constructed out of orbitals @xmath63 , the algorithm will return @xmath64 in at most @xmath0 steps .",
    "the reason is that @xmath34 belongs to the subspace spanned by the orbitals @xmath63 , and therefore , after @xmath0 steps , all the @xmath65 s belong to this subspace .",
    "since they are orthogonal to each other , the @xmath65 s span the same subspace as the @xmath66 s and construct the same slater determinant @xmath15 .",
    "the optimal orbitals for @xmath67 are called brueckner orbitals @xcite .",
    "they have some useful properties and hence have long been sought - after @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite an algorithm similar to ours was proposed , with the difference that the @xmath0 orbitals are updated all at the same time , while in our case they are updated one by one , yielding monotonous improvement .      for the two - fermion case ( @xmath68 ) , the problem can be solved in closed form .",
    "first , note that a two - fermion wave function has the canonical form @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes the slater determinant constructed out of the two orbitals @xmath71 and @xmath72 , i.e. , @xmath73.\\quad \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the orbitals @xmath74 are orthonormal .",
    "the coefficients @xmath75 are positive , ordered in descending order , and satisfy the normalization condition @xmath76 .",
    "the physical meaning of the @xmath66 s and the @xmath77 s are apparent by the expression of the one - particle reduced density matrix @xmath78 ( here @xmath15 understood as a @xmath79 matrix ) , @xmath80 .",
    "\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that is , @xmath81 are the natural orbitals and @xmath75 is the ( degenerate ) occupation number of the orbitals @xmath71 and @xmath82 .    an approximate wave function",
    "can also be reduced to a canonical form and therefore , for @xmath68 , taking @xmath5 odd is wasteful because the same state can be constructed using @xmath83 orbitals .",
    "we thus assume @xmath5 even here . noting that the projection of an antisymmetric function onto the @xmath84-dimensional antisymmetric subspace is the same as its projection onto the whole @xmath85-dimensional tensor product space",
    ", we see that in the case of @xmath68 , @xmath30 has the compact form of @xmath86 here the @xmath87 matrix @xmath88 is defined as @xmath89 , with @xmath90 the @xmath91 matrix whose columns are the @xmath5 orbitals .",
    "we have @xmath92 here the first inequality is due to the fact that @xmath93 is a projection operator and thus semi - positive definite , while the second one follows from ky fan s inequality @xcite , which essentially states that the sum of @xmath94 diagonal elements of a hermitian matrix is upper bounded by the sum of its @xmath94 largest eigenvalues .",
    "note that both equalities can be achieved if the orbitals are chosen as @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath68 , the @xmath5 orbitals which should be chosen are simply the @xmath5 most populated natural orbitals .",
    "we note that the analysis above can be adapted to the two - boson case straightforwardly .",
    "given a two - boson wave function @xmath97 , with @xmath98 , the similar question is to find @xmath99 orbitals so that the projection of @xmath100 in the @xmath101-dimensional permanent space is maximal . to answer this question , first we note that similar to ( [ canonicalf ] ) , a two - boson wave function also has a canonical form @xcite , @xmath102 here the @xmath66 s are orthonormal and the @xmath103 s are positive and ordered in descending order and satisfying the normalization condition @xmath104 .",
    "the one - particle reduced density matrix @xmath105 is now @xmath106 we again have eq .",
    "( [ direct ] ) if @xmath15 is replaced by @xmath100 , and similar to ( [ fan ] ) , we have @xmath107 the equalities can be taken if the orbitals are taken as the first @xmath5 natural orbitals , i.e. , @xmath95 , @xmath108 .",
    "_ we have thus shown that for the special case of @xmath68 , the orbitals which should be taken are simply the natural orbitals .",
    "_ this means that more direct methods can be used instead of the iteration algorithm , e.g. , full exact diagonalization or the lanczos method .",
    "however , it is nonetheless instructive to see how the algorithm works in the special case of @xmath109 ( see below ) , which may hint at the convergence behavior of the algorithm also for the more general case of @xmath110 .",
    "updating @xmath32 with respect to @xmath42 means replacing @xmath32 by @xmath111 , up to some normalization factor . updating @xmath42 with respect to the new @xmath32 means replacing the old @xmath42 by @xmath112 , up to some normalization factor .",
    "therefore , in the special case of @xmath109 , the algorithm reduces to the power method for the largest eigenvalue .",
    "this method is guaranteed to converge to the right result for a generic initial value of @xmath42 .",
    "but it can be slow if @xmath113 is close to unity and in this case , it can be replaced by the more efficient lanczos method @xcite .",
    "in the proceeding subsection , we have proven that in the two - fermion or two - boson case ( @xmath68 ) , the maximal value of @xmath116 for a multi - configuration approximation with @xmath117 orbitals has the following expression , @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the @xmath9th largest eigenvalue of the one - particle reduced density matrix @xmath120 .",
    "we have @xmath121 .",
    "we now proceed to show that in the more general case of @xmath115 , for both fermions and bosons , there holds the inequality @xmath122 to prove this inequality , suppose @xmath123 are a set of ( orthonormal ) optimal orbitals .",
    "we can extend this basis to a full basis @xmath124 of the single - particle space . denote the creation operator corresponding to orbital @xmath125 as @xmath126 .",
    "the wave function @xmath15 can be expanded as    [ fexp ] @xmath127    here @xmath88 is the set @xmath128 and @xmath129 is an @xmath0-tuple . for fermions , the elements of @xmath17 are all different while for bosons , some of them can be identical .",
    "the notation @xmath130 means that each element of @xmath17 is also an element of @xmath88 , otherwise @xmath131 applies .",
    "we have @xmath132 now we note that @xmath133 the first inequality is again a consequence of ky fan s inequality while the second one is obvious . combining ( [ imax ] ) and ( [ ine ] ) ,",
    "we get ( [ myine ] ) .",
    "we now turn to a specific model in order to check the performance of the algorithm and to study physical properties from the perspective of entanglement in a multipartite system .",
    "we consider spinless ( or spin polarized ) fermions on a one - dimensional @xmath134-site lattice .",
    "specifically , the hamiltonian is ( @xmath135 throughout ) @xmath136 here @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator on site @xmath139 , and @xmath140 counts the occupation number .",
    "the usual anti - commutation relations hold , i.e. , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 .",
    "the first term is the hopping term while the second term describes the interaction ( with strength @xmath143 ) between two fermions sitting on adjacent sites .",
    "the total number of fermions is conserved and will be denoted as @xmath0 .",
    "we use open boundary conditions .",
    "the first step is to check the convergence property of the algorithm .",
    "instead of trying the algorithm on artificial states , we prefer physical states such as the ground state or a time - evolved state after a sudden quench .",
    "specifically , we will use states of the model ( [ h ] ) .",
    "three cases are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ conv ] . in fig .",
    "[ conv](a ) , we have @xmath144 fermions on a lattice with @xmath145 sites and the system is in the ground state . in figs .",
    "[ conv](b ) and [ conv](c ) , the two test states are from the following scenario . initially the four fermions are confined to the four left most sites of the 20-site lattice by some wall and , since there is no freedom at all , the system is obviously in a slater determinant wave function .",
    "then at @xmath146 , the wall is suddenly removed and the fermions expand into the whole lattice . denoting the wave function at time @xmath147 as @xmath148 , the test wave functions in fig .",
    "[ conv](b ) and [ conv](c ) are @xmath149 and @xmath150 , respectively .    for all the three test states , we try to approximate them with a single slater determinant , i.e. , the number of single - particle orbitals is @xmath151 .",
    "moreover , for each test state , we have run the algorithm with six different initial sets of orbitals @xmath152 , marked by different symbols .",
    "we see that for all the states and for all the initial values of the orbitals , the value of @xmath153 converges to its final value monotonically from below as expected , and moreover , generally in no more than 50 iteration steps , it has converged with good precision .",
    "figures [ conv](a ) and [ conv](b ) demonstrate that the algorithm works well ; all six runs converge to the same limiting value .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "[ conv](c ) , we have two runs converging to a local maximum . more extensive investigation ( with up to hundreds of runs ) showed that for the two states in figs .",
    "[ conv](a ) and [ conv](b ) , the algorithm would never be trapped in a local maximum , and for the state in fig .",
    "[ conv](c ) , fortunately , there is only one local maximum and the probability of hitting it is less than @xmath154 .    to deal with the local maxima",
    ", we simply run the code multiple times ( at least six ) @xcite and take the maximal final value of @xmath116 .",
    "extensive investigation showed that this strategy is a very safe one .",
    "at least for the model ( [ h ] ) , the number of local maxima is small ( we have not observed any case with more than one local maxima ) and the probability of hitting them is smaller than hitting the global one .",
    "therefore , we are confident that our data are exact . in the following ,",
    "all data are generated in this way .",
    "some remarks are in order . in fig .",
    "[ conv ] , on the scale of the vertical axes , it seems that @xmath116 has completely converged once the plateau is reached , when in fact a slow drift is still in progress . to demonstrate this fact ,",
    "we have considered the following scenario .",
    "suppose initially the @xmath0 fermions are confined to the @xmath155 left most sites and are in the ground state . then at @xmath146 , the confinement is lifted and at the same time the value of @xmath143 is quenched to zero .",
    "the subsequent evolution is an evolution of free fermions and the wave function can always be exactly represented with @xmath155 orbitals , which can be easily solved from the single - particle schrdinger equation .",
    "that is , for @xmath148 with an arbitrary @xmath147 , @xmath156 if @xmath157 .",
    "we have checked the algorithm against this rigorous result .",
    "the trajectories of @xmath116 are plotted in fig .",
    "there , we see that the initial phase of convergence is fast .",
    "regardless of the initial values of the orbitals , @xmath116 builds up to around @xmath158 in 15 iteration steps . however , the subsequent process of convergence towards unity is very slow .",
    "hundreds of steps are needed to reduce the error by one half even in the best case .",
    "this late slow improvement is understandable in view of the fact that in the @xmath109 case , the algorithm reduces to the power method , which is well - known to be slow in the rate of convergence .",
    "fortunately , the first , relatively fast stage of convergence generally can already bring @xmath116 sufficiently close to @xmath159 , and therefore , the late slow convergence does not prevent us from studying physics quantitatively using the algorithm .",
    "having established the reliability of the algorithm , we now proceed to study physical properties of the model ( [ h ] ) using it .",
    "the first object that we consider is the ground state .",
    "the question is , in the presence of interaction , to what extent can the ground state be approximated using a slater determinant .",
    "how does the strength of the interaction and the volume accessible to the fermions ( i.e. , the lattice size @xmath134 ) influence it ?",
    "it turns out that the answer depends on the sign of @xmath143 .",
    "let us treat the case of positive @xmath143 first",
    ". for positive @xmath143 , two limits allow for a simple picture . in the limit of @xmath160 ,",
    "the fermions have no freedom to distribute themselves and the wave function is exactly in a slater determinant form . in the opposite limit of @xmath161 ,",
    "the fermions have little chance to encounter each other and interact and the ground state should can be well approximated by a slater determinant .",
    "therefore , in the two limits , it is expected that @xmath162 , and there should be a minimum of @xmath163 at some intermediate @xmath134 .",
    "this is indeed what is observed in fig .",
    "[ gspositive ] . there",
    ", in the two panels , which correspond to two different values of @xmath0 ( @xmath164 and @xmath165 ) , we see that regardless of the value of @xmath143 , @xmath163 tends to unity at the two extremes and develops a minimum in between .",
    "note that for @xmath160 and @xmath166 , @xmath156 exactly .",
    "this is trivial for @xmath160 . for @xmath167 ,",
    "it is a consequence of a theorem @xcite ( see also appendix  [ appa ] ) , i.e. , if there are only @xmath168 orbitals available to @xmath0 fermions , then the wave function must be a slater determinant . in this paper , we shall refer to this theorem as the @xmath0-in-@xmath169 theorem .    a noticeable fact in fig .",
    "[ gspositive ] is that , at @xmath170 , as @xmath143 increases , a local maximum develops . as @xmath171 , this local maximum will go to unity .",
    "this local maximum is a geometric effect . for @xmath170",
    ", the @xmath0 fermions can reside at every other lattice site , thus forming a charge - density wave ( cdw ) . in this configuration",
    ", they can avoid to interact with each other .",
    "this unique configuration has the lowest interaction energy and in the large @xmath143 limit , it would be a good approximation to the ground state and therefore @xmath172 .",
    "on the contrary , for other values of @xmath134 , there are several configurations degenerate in the interaction energy . in the large @xmath143 limit ,",
    "they hybridize into the ground state and therefore the latter has much worse approximation . at @xmath170 ,",
    "the picture is that as @xmath143 increases from zero to infinity , the slater determinant approximation first deteriorates and then becomes perfect again .",
    "the negative @xmath143 case is also interesting . for negative @xmath143 , in the ground state",
    ", there is the possibility of binding of particles if the attraction is strong enough .",
    "that is , all or some the particles are bound together .",
    "once this happens , the correlation between the particles is strong and the slater approximation will get worse .",
    "for the two - fermion case , for the model ( [ h ] ) on a infinite lattice , it is easy to show that the critical value of @xmath143 for the ground state to be a bound fermion - pair is @xmath173 . for @xmath174 ,",
    "the attraction is insufficient to bind the two fermions .",
    "they interact but are delocalized with respect to each other . like in the positive @xmath143 case , we expect @xmath163 to go to unity in the @xmath161 limit .",
    "however , for @xmath175 , the two fermions form a pair and hops on the lattice as a whole . in terms of the wave function @xmath176",
    ", it has a band profile along the diagonal @xmath177 .",
    "this in turn means that the one - particle reduced density matrix @xmath178 has also a band profile and the largest magnitude of its element is on the order of @xmath179 .",
    "the magnitude of the element should decay exponentially away from the main diagonal .",
    "therefore , by the gershgorin disk theorem @xcite , the largest eigenvalue of @xmath178 should be on the order of @xmath179 . by the analysis in sec .",
    "[ caseofn2 ] , @xmath163 should be on the order of @xmath179 .",
    "in particular , it decays to zero in the @xmath180 limit .",
    "these predictions are verified by the algorithm @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ gsnegative](a ) , with @xmath68 and for three different values of @xmath181 , @xmath163 is plotted as a function of @xmath134 .",
    "the bifurcation is clear . at the critical value of @xmath182",
    ", @xmath163 converges to a finite value slowly . on the two sides",
    ", it either converges to unity or to zero . in fig .",
    "[ gsnegative](b ) , the @xmath183 case is studied .",
    "we again see the bifurcation behavior at @xmath184 .",
    "it signals that beyond this critical value of @xmath143 , in the ground state two of the three fermions are bound together , although not necessarily all of them .      upon time evolution ,",
    "the particles collide with each other .",
    "therefore , the wave function may become very complicated when represented with slater determinants .",
    "an important type of dynamics starts from a wave function which is or can be well approximated by a slater determinant . with time , the wave function is likely to become entangled and the approximation will deteriorate .",
    "the rate and the extent of the developing entanglement is interesting in its own right , and will be discussed in the context of the mctdhf algorithm and its accuracy .",

    "the fidelity @xmath192 decays much slower and even in the single configuration approximation and even at time @xmath194 , @xmath192 is close to @xmath195 . that is , in a large time interval",
    ", the wave function can always be well approximated using a very limited ( even minimal ) number of orbitals .",
    "it is not obvious why the approximation of the initial state in ( a ) deteriorates quickly but the one in ( b ) only slowly and weakly .",
    "however , we note that the interaction clearly plays a role . in figs .",
    "[ evoeta](c ) and [ evoeta](d ) , the expectation value of the interaction energy in figs .",
    "[ evoeta](a ) and [ evoeta](b ) , respectively , is plotted against time . while @xmath196 is close to unity all the time in ( c ) , which means the probability of finding a pair of fermions interacting with each other is high , it is smaller by one order of magnitude in ( d ) most of the time .",
    "of course , without interaction , the value of @xmath192 will remain constant .",
    "this may explain the relatively slow and weak decay of @xmath193 in ( b ) .",
    "a subtle fact in figs .  [ evoeta](b ) and [ evoeta](d ) is also noteworthy . in fig .",
    "[ evoeta](d ) , we see that the interaction energy @xmath197 shows periodic peaks ( with a period @xmath198 ) .",
    "the reason behind is that the particles bounce back and forward between the lattice ends .",
    "when they concentrate at an end [ see fig .  [ den](b3 ) ] , the interaction energy develops a peak , and accordingly , the value of @xmath193 in the case of @xmath189 or @xmath199 drops down relatively quickly .",
    "interestingly , sometimes when @xmath197 decreases ( the particles disperse again ) , the value of @xmath193 moves up again ( revival ) , and we observe a clear peak - dip correspondence for @xmath200 .",
    "we then see that under time - evolution , @xmath193 does not necessarily decrease monotonically .",
    "so far , we have focused on @xmath159 , which appears only as a mathematical construct . to understand its relation to physical quantities , it is necessary to compare a given wave function and its optimal multi - configuration approximation ( in the sense of inner product ) regarding a specific observable .",
    "does the value of @xmath159 have any implication on it ? especially , does a @xmath159 close to unity imply that the approximate wave function is a good one as regards a _ generic _ physical quantity too ?",
    "[ dencomp ] shows the density distribution @xmath201 of the exact wave function @xmath148 and those of its optimal multi - configuration approximations . in each panel of fig .",
    "[ dencomp ] , a wave function from the corresponding panel of fig .",
    "[ evoeta ] is taken , for which two optimal approximations with @xmath189 or @xmath202 are then constructed using the algorithm . in fig .",
    "[ dencomp](a ) , we see that the @xmath189 approximation differs from the exact distribution significantly .",
    "the @xmath190 approximation becomes better but the discrepancy is still apparent .",
    "this is in agreement with the low values of @xmath159 in fig .",
    "[ evoeta](a ) . there , at @xmath203",
    ", @xmath159 is as small as @xmath204 for @xmath189 and only @xmath205 for @xmath206 .    on the contrary , in fig .",
    "[ dencomp](b ) , at @xmath194 , we see that the density distributions of both approximations are very close to the exact one .",
    "this is quite remarkable .",
    "note that at @xmath194 , the interaction energy @xmath197 has peaked eight times .",
    "yet a single slater determinant suffices to capture the density distribution of the exact wave function quantitatively .",
    "this is of course a favorable situation for the mctdhf algorithm .",
    "it is also in agreement with the high values of @xmath193 in fig .",
    "[ evoeta](b ) . in appendix",
    "[ appb ] , we show that closeness in inner product implies closeness in density distribution , though the reverse is obviously not true .",
    "the way @xmath192 decays has important consequences for the mctdhf method . in this algorithm",
    ", it is assumed that a good approximation of the wave function can be achieved by choosing a limited number of orbitals optimally and adaptively .",
    "now once @xmath192 , the maximal overlap between a multi - configurational function and the exact wave function , deviates significantly away from unity , the foundation of mctdhf is unclear and its predictions might be no longer reliable .",
    "for the two examples in fig .",
    "[ evoeta ] , we thus expect the mctdhf to break down quickly in case ( a ) while slowly in case ( b ) , which is indeed the case . in fig",
    ".  [ den ] , the evolution of the density distribution @xmath201 of the system is studied using both exact diagonalization ( blue lines with circles ) and mctdhf ( red lines with squares , @xmath189 ; green lines with asterisks , @xmath190 ) .",
    "the left four panels [ panels ( a1)-(a4 ) ] correspond to fig .",
    "[ evoeta](a ) , while the right four correspond to fig .",
    "[ evoeta](b ) .",
    "we see that in case ( a ) and with @xmath189 orbitals , the prediction of mctdhf deviates from the exact evolution already significantly at @xmath207 [ fig .",
    "[ den](a1 ) ] , and at @xmath208 , it misses the main features of the exact distribution [ fig .",
    "[ den](a2 ) ] . using more orbitals ( @xmath190 ) , the result of mctdhf improves but beyond @xmath209 , it becomes bad again .",
    "this is of course not surprising in view of fig .",
    "[ dencomp](a ) .",
    "there we see that at @xmath203 , even the optimal approximate wave functions differ significantly from the exact wave function in density distribution .    in case",
    "( b ) , on the other hand , even with a single configuration @xmath210 , mctdhf can capture the main features of the real density distribution up to @xmath203 .",
    "with more orbitals ( @xmath190 ) , the accuracy improves .",
    "this is quite remarkable , since the even with @xmath190 , the working dimension of mctdhf is just 56 , which is much smaller than @xmath211 , the working dimension of exact diagonalization . of course , eventually the prediction of mctdhf will deviate far away from the exact result ( not shown here ) . but this is because of accumulation of error , not because the exact wave function itself can not be well represented by a multi - configuration approximation . actually , as we see in fig .",
    "[ dencomp](b ) , even at time @xmath194 , even in the minimal case ( @xmath212 ) , the optimal approximate wave function can capture the exact density distribution quantitatively very well .",
    "we have devised an algorithm for constructing the optimal multi - configuration approximation of a multi - fermion wave function . the basic idea is to optimize one orbital with all other orbitals fixed .",
    "this procedure can be repeated by sweeping through the orbitals . in this way",
    ", the algorithm converges monotonically and thus definitely .",
    "sometimes it can become trapped in local maxima but by running the code several times , the global maximum is hit with high probability .",
    "the algorithm can be easily parallelized .",
    "we have also provided an upper bound of @xmath193 in eq .",
    "( [ myine ] ) . though not very accurate as an estimate in some circumstances ( for the case in fig .",
    "[ evoeta](a ) , it overestimates @xmath193 by more than a factor of two for @xmath189 ) , it is much easier to calculate .",
    "we have employed the algorithm to study spinless interacting one - dimensional lattice fermions , analyzing whether the ground state as well as the time - evolving states can be well approximated by multi - configuration slater determinants . for the ground state ,",
    "the algorithm reveals the cdw order and a bound fermionic pair , in the repulsive and attractive interaction case , respectively .",
    "the study of dynamics showed that the performance of mctdhf depends strongly on whether the time - evolving state can be well approximated by a multi - configuration wave function using only a limited number of orbitals .",
    "an important observation is that , in some cases , the multi - configuration approximation improves only slowly as the number of orbitals @xmath5 increases , i.e. , the value of @xmath192 increases only slowly with @xmath5 .",
    "this implies that it can be inefficient to improve the quality of mctdhf by increasing the number of orbitals .    in this paper",
    "we have applied the algorithm only to a simple model ( one - dimensional and with short - range interaction ) . in the future , hopefully it will find use in more realistic models in atomic or condensed matter physics .",
    "for example , the hartree - fock approximation is used widely to calculate the ground state of atoms or ions or molecules .",
    "but can the ground state be well approximated by a single slater determinant at all ?",
    "if so , to what extent ?",
    "our algorithm may be used to address these questions .",
    "there are actually a lot of systems in atomic and condensed matter physics in which correlation between particles is essential .",
    "for example , the negative hydrogen ion @xcite , and the laughlin wave function @xcite in the fractional quantum hall effect , to mention a few of the most famous ones .",
    "the latter is usually taken as a paradigm of non - fermi liquid , with the picture of fermi sea ( a slater determinant wave function ) breaking down completely .",
    "in other words , the value of @xmath193 must be small for the laughlin wave function",
    ". it would be worthwhile to check this point and study the scaling behaviors .",
    "unfortunately , the algorithm is applicable only to fermions but not to bosons . for bosons , instead of determinants , the basis states of a multi - particle system",
    "are permanents .",
    "similar to fermions , for bosons the question is how to choose @xmath5 orbitals so that the given wave function can be best approximated in the @xmath213-dimensional space spanned by the permanents .",
    "however , the idea of fixing all orbitals except for one and optimizing it no longer works .",
    "the reason is simply that for bosons , in a permanent , the same orbital can appear more than once and one no longer obtains a quadratic maximization problem like in eq .",
    "( [ quad ] ) .",
    "note also that permanents are more difficult to calculate than determinants .",
    "while gaussian elimination can be used to calculate the determinant in polynomial time , this method can not be used to calculate the permanent .",
    "another limitation of the algorithm is of course that the wave function needs to be explicitly available .",
    "this means that only systems can be studied that are within the capacity of exact diagonalization methods .",
    "an open question is whether one can obtain an estimate ( say , an upper or lower bound ) of the entanglement in a wave function with only some partial information .",
    "we are grateful to alex d. gottlieb and mathias nest for seminal discussions and to duan - lu zhou , michael sekania , and patrik thunstrm for their helpful comments .",
    "this work was supported in part by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft through trr 80 .",
    "though this theorem has been known for a long time @xcite , here we still would like to provide some more proofs .",
    "it is always good to have new proofs of old theorems , since different proofs provide different insights from different perspectives .",
    "suppose @xmath214 is the wave function of a @xmath0-fermion system with @xmath166 single - particle orbitals available to each fermion .",
    "let @xmath215 be @xmath0 orthonormal single - particle orbitals , out of which the slater determinant having the largest overlap with @xmath15 can be constructed .",
    "this basis can be completed by adding one more orbital @xmath216 .",
    "now @xmath15 can be expanded as @xmath217 here @xmath218 denotes the slater determinant constructed out of the @xmath65 s except for @xmath219 , with the convention that the coefficient of @xmath220 being positive .",
    "now we claim that @xmath221 for @xmath222 , and thus the wave function @xmath15 can be written as a single slater determinant @xmath223 . to prove this ,",
    "suppose @xmath224 for some @xmath225 .",
    "we then note that the superposition of @xmath226 and @xmath227 can be rewritten as a single slater determinant @xmath228 here @xmath229 is the modified @xmath94-th orbital @xmath230 which is a hybrid of @xmath231 and @xmath216 .",
    "we have thus constructed a new slater determinant with even larger overlap with @xmath15 than @xmath223 .",
    "this is in contradiction with the assumption and therefore the claim is proven .",
    "another more constructive proof goes like this .",
    "take an arbitrary orthonormal basis @xmath232 .",
    "similar to ( [ fexpan ] ) , we have the expansion @xmath233 now construct a single - particle orbital @xmath234 it is straightforward to show that @xmath235 it is readily seen that this means that @xmath15 is the slater determinant constructed out of the @xmath0-dimensional subspace complement to @xmath236 . the orbital @xmath236 is unoccupied at all and that explains the subscript .    in the second quantization formalism ,",
    "the function in ( [ fexpan2 ] ) is @xmath237 is the vacuum state and @xmath238 ( @xmath239 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for a fermion in orbital @xmath240 . defining a new creation operator corresponding to the orbital ( [ hole ] ) ,",
    "@xmath241 , and defining a set of creation operators @xmath242 corresponding to the complement space of @xmath236 , we can rewrite @xmath243 as @xmath244 therefore , @xmath15 is a slater determinant spanned by the complement of @xmath236 . yet another way to understand the `` hole '' is to study the one - particle reduced density matrix .",
    "it is easily shown that @xmath245 it is the identity matrix deflated by one rank , and its kernel is just the hole orbital .",
    "suppose two ( normalized to unity ) @xmath0-fermion wave functions @xmath246 and @xmath247 are close by inner product , i.e. , @xmath248 .",
    "note that here it is assumed that the inner product is a positive real number , as is always achievable by choosing the global phase of @xmath249 or @xmath250 .",
    "a direct consequence is @xmath251 .",
    "the corresponding density distribution is given by ( @xmath252 , 2 ) @xmath253 we have for the @xmath254 distance between @xmath255 and @xmath256 , @xmath257 therefore , closeness in inner product means closeness in density distribution .",
    "the reverse is obviously not true .",
    "since an unambiguous definition of correlation or entanglement in a multipartite system is still missing , and it is the case especially for identical particles , in this paper we talk about correlation or entanglement qualitatively or intuitively only .                                                      a natural idea is to use the natural orbitals as the initial guess of the @xmath65 s . for @xmath68",
    ", they are simply the ultimate answer . however , for @xmath115 , numerical experiments showed that they do not offer any definite advantage to randomly chosen initial guesses ."
