    ". the x - ray signatures of bhbs are well known and categorized into distinct states , defined by the presence of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) , the total rms variability of their power - spectra , and the fitted parameters and relative strengths of thermal and non - thermal components of their x - ray spectra .",

    "the source had risen very sharply from non - detection on mjd 55462 to a weak detection on mjd 55463 ( @xmath30 counts@xmath31s@xmath32 , @xmath33kev ) and then a @xmath34detection ( @xmath35 counts@xmath31s@xmath32 ) in the daily average on mjd 55464 .",
    "there was no detection of the source dating back to january 2006 with a @xmath36  upper limit of @xmath37 counts@xmath31 s@xmath32 .",
    "the bat light - curve is well modeled by a sharp rise from a low level detection to peak rate of @xmath38 counts@xmath31s@xmath32 on mjd 55465 , followed by a slow exponential decay , until it became undetectable in the bat @xmath33kev energy range after mjd 55529 , with a @xmath36 upper limit of @xmath39countss@xmath40 @xmath41 .",
    "the xrt wt light - curve starts on mjd 55464 , at a level of @xmath42 countss@xmath32 , which corresponds to a flux of @xmath43 erg s@xmath32@xmath31 ( @xmath44kev ) .",
    "the light - curve continues to rise to peak around mjd 55476 , approximately 11days after the peak of the bat light - curve , after which maxi  j1659@xmath0152 begins a slow decline .",

    "the abrupt change in the hardness ratio on mjd 55657 is most likely a indication of the evolution of the source from the hard state , to the steep power - law state , which is followed by a slow evolution into the thermal state .",

    "the uvot light - curve shows a correlated rise with the x - ray light - curve , peaking around mjd 55465 at @xmath50 , followed by a slower decline .",
    "the observation performed on mjd 55598 ( not shown in figure  [ fig : light - curves ] ) finds the source at a greatly lowered flux level than seen during outburst , approximately @xmath51 countss@xmath32 , corresponding to a flux of @xmath52 .",
    "the observed hardness ratio ( @xmath53 ) during this observation suggests that the source had returned to the hard state .",
    "the uvot data show that the optical counterpart had faded to @xmath54 mag , a drop of approximately 1.3 magnitude from the previous measurement 107 days earlier , and @xmath55 magnitudes fainter than the peak outburst brightness . as discussed earlier , we assume that the quiescent optical brightness is @xmath29 , and therefore on mjd 55598 maxi  j1659@xmath0152 is still in outburst .",
    "we fit the simultaneous bat@xmath56xrt spectra in the @xmath44kev and @xmath57kev energy bands for xrt and bat , respectively .",
    "factors were included in the fitting to allow for normalization uncertainties between the two instruments , which are constrained within their usual ranges ( 0.91.1 ) .",
    "each spectrum was fit with a three - component model consisting of a power - law model ( powerlaw ) , a model of thermal emission from the accretion disk ( diskbb , @xcite ) , and a model of the total absorption ( tbabs ) with the abundance set to the values given by @xcite .",
    "we calculated the fraction of flux contribution from the diskbb model , @xmath58 , by finding the ratio of the model fitted @xmath45kev flux from the diskbb component with the combined flux from both the diskbb and powerlaw components .",
    "example xrt@xmath56bat spectra at three different epochs are shown in figure  [ fig:3spec ] .    in order to test the requirement of the disk component over a simple absorbed power - law model",
    ", we performed an f - test comparison between fits of the two models for every fitted spectra throughout the outburst . for fits before mjd 55465 , which coincides with the peak of the bat flux ( figure  [ fig : light - curves ] )",
    ", we find an f - test probability of @xmath59 for approximately @xmath60 of the fitted spectra , suggesting that during this period , a disk component is not needed with a high significance to fit the x - ray spectrum , as expected for a bhb in the hard state .",
    "after mjd 55465 , we find that @xmath61 of the fitted spectra have an f - test probability of @xmath62 , showing that the addition of a disk component significantly improves the fit for the majority of cases . we therefore conclude that the disk component is statistically significant for all times during the _ swift _  observations of the outburst other than during the very early part ( earlier than mjd 55465 ) .",
    "the fitted spectral parameters as a function of time are shown in figure  [ fig : spectral_evo ] . as inferred from the hardness ratio changes , maxi  j1659@xmath0152 shows significant spectral evolution during the outburst . during the initial detection",
    "the spectrum is well fit by an absorbed power - law model with @xmath63 , indicating a bhb in the hard state .",
    "as maxi  j1659@xmath0152 brightens the spectrum softens and continues to be dominated by power - law emission with a @xmath64 on mjd 55468 , signaling the transition to the steep power - law state . during this time",
    ", the disk blackbody component is a small ( @xmath65% ) , but statistically significant and evolving ( @xmath66 rising from @xmath67kev to @xmath68kev ) , component of the spectrum .",
    "after mjd 55469 the source appears to evolving to the thermal state , indicated by the disk fraction @xmath58 increasing from @xmath69 on mjd 55465 to @xmath1 by mjd 55485 and remaining approximately constant until the proximity of maxi  j1659@xmath0152 to the sun forced the end of _ swift _  monitoring observations on mjd 55491 . in this period @xmath70 is in the range of @xmath71kev , typical for bhb in the thermal state .",
    "therefore we do not observe the full state transition between the steep power - law and thermal states , defined by @xcite as occurring when @xmath72 , with the source remaining in an intermediate state .    in order to assess the possible presence of a spectral break , we fit a model to the data consisting of a diskbb plus cut - off power - law ( cutoffpl ) model to data from mjd 55484.57 ( see figure  [ fig:3spec ] ) chosen as this data correspond to the peak bat flux of maxi  j1659@xmath0152 .",
    "the fitted value of the cut - off energy is poorly constrained , @xmath73 kev , with a measured photon index of @xmath74 .",
    "an f - test shows that there is little evidence of an improvement in the fit if a spectral break is added ( f=2.02 , giving a null - hypothesis probability of 0.16 ) , and therefore the cut - off power - law is not required to fit the xrt@xmath56bat data .",
    "we note that there are currently no analysis tools available that allow integration of bat spectra over longer periods than an individual _ swift _  observation snapshot , which would be required to improve the accuracy of the spectral measurement . given this and the brightness of the bat data , if a spectral break is present , the xrt@xmath56bat data are not sensitive to it .    the expected galactic line - of - sight absorption for maxi  j1659@xmath0152 is @xmath75@xmath31 @xcite , however the fitted absorption column is higher and variable , indicating an additional intrinsic absorption component .",
    "the fitted @xmath76 increases rapidly during the initial stages of the outburst , beginning at @xmath77 on mjd 55464 and rising to a mean value of @xmath78 on mjd 55465 .",
    "measured absorption remains consistent with this value until observations ceased on mjd 55491 .",
    "fitting more complex models for absorption such as a warm absorber or partial covering model , with a fixed galactic absorption also provide good fits to the increasing absorption , although given the spectral resolution of the xrt data , these more complex models are not required over a simple single - parameter variable absorption model .    a later follow - up observation taken on mjd 55598 after maxi  j1659@xmath0152 had faded significantly to a flux of @xmath79 ( 0.5 - 10 kev ) and entered the hard state ( @xmath80 , no significantly detected disk component ) , gives a fitted absorption of @xmath81 , consistent with the post - outburst value , suggesting that the additional absorption component is still present despite the lowered x - ray flux .    with moderate resolution spectral fitting , variable absorption may be due to a statistical correlation between spectral parameters . to investigate this we examined confidence contours in ( @xmath76 , @xmath82 ) parameter space , and find that the low @xmath76 spectra ( mjd 55464 ) are distinct from the higher @xmath76 spectra ( mjd 55465 ) with @xmath83 confidence .",
    "joint bat and xrt spectral fits allow to constrain @xmath82 and @xmath76 more independently than by fitting xrt alone .",
    "care was taken to remove the effects of pile - up from the spectra , as pile - up can considerably affect continuum spectra fitting @xcite .",
    "the fitted values of @xmath76 and @xmath82 do not vary in lock - step either , given the fast initial rise in @xmath76 between mjd 55464 and mjd 55465 , compared with an linear rise in @xmath82 ending around mjd 55470 .",
    "the consistency of the measured absorption in the later follow - up observation of maxi  j1659@xmath0152 provides further evidence that the measured @xmath76 is not related to the fitted model or source brightness .",
    "we therefore conclude that the variable absorption is physical and not an artifact of the fit .",
    "we searched for qpos using a fast fourier transform method , adopting the power - spectral normalization of @xcite and the search technique described by @xcite . for each orbit of xrt data , power density spectra ( pds ) were generated for @xmath84 continuous sections of data of 4096 bins duration , with a bin size of 0.01 s , and averaged .",
    "the averaged pds from each orbit was then rebinned in frequency so that @xmath85 continuous frequencies were averaged , using a geometrical series binning scheme .",
    "each rebinned / averaged pds was fit with a model consisting of a power - law for the low frequency noise , a lorentzian for the qpo ( whose width was fixed to preserve a quality factor @xmath86 of 5 ) and a constant for the poisson noise level .",
    "the qpo was considered detected if the lorentzian amplitude exceeded the local detection level , @xmath87 ( given by the integral probability of a chi - squared distribution for @xmath88 d.o.f , .",
    "scaled by a factor of 1/mw ) minus the mean noise level , which is 2 for the @xcite normalization .",
    "example pds for 4 epochs are shown in figure  [ fig:4_pspe ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : qpo_freq ] shows in two energy bands ( @xmath46kev and @xmath45kev ) , the qpo frequency , the fractional rms variability of the fitted lorentzian for pds in which qpo were detected at greater than @xmath83 , and the broadband continuum rms for @xmath89hz , including the qpo and low - frequency noise components .",
    "the qpo frequency and detection energy evolves with the qpo peak frequency increasing approximately linearly with time .",
    "after mjd 55466 qpos are not detected in the @xmath46kev band , but are still detected in the @xmath45kev band until mjd 55472 .",
    "the qpo frequency is correlated with the fitted value of @xmath82 , which has been observed previously in bhbs ( e.g. 4u  1543 - 47 , @xcite ) .",
    "the pds rms power for both energy bands fall rapidly during the initial outburst , as expected given the transition between the hard state and the steep power - law state which occurs on mjd 55467 . in the thermal state ,",
    "qpos are generally weak or absent @xcite , therefore the non - detection of qpos after mjd 55474 is consistent with the evolution towards that state .",
    "the xrt detected qpos are consistent with those seen by _",
    "due to being on - source earlier than than _ rxte _ , we detect lower frequency qpos in the range of @xmath90 hz to @xmath91hz in the time period of mjd 55464.35 to mjd 55467.88 . the evolution in frequency over time of these",
    "qpos is consistent with the extrapolation of the trend seen during _ rxte _",
    "observations between mjd 55467 and approximately mjd 55478 .",
    "uvot data were also obtained in event mode between mjd 55472.155475.4 in @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 bands .",
    "unbinned source light curves ( not background subtracted ) , for each of these , were used to produce pds and to calculate the rms variability with the heasoft tools powspec and lcstats respectively . within each of these",
    "the binning was set to be @xmath92 times the minimum bin size ( 11.0322ms ) where @xmath93 for the pds and @xmath94 ( 88.2576ms ) for the rms variability , giving frequency ranges of 0.00690hz and 0.0061hz respectively .",
    "both the pds and the rms imply a level of variability consistent with zero , though can only place a loose constraint of @xmath95 .",
    "the xrt light - curve shows frequent dips , which do not appear to have a consistent shape or spectral signature .",
    "an example of a dipping episode , seen on mjd 55469 , is shown in figure  [ fig : dip ] , although it should be noted that this is not necessarily representative of other dips .",
    "the dipping shows two components that we differentiate by their spectral signature : a series of dips of varying timescales , with no apparent associated spectral change ( non - hard dips ) , and a narrower sharp dip with an associated spectral hardening ( hard - dip ) .",
    "analysis of uvot event data taken during dips do not show any evidence of correlated optical variability , although no event mode data was taken during a hard dip .",
    "if , as @xcite suggest , the dips are analogous to those seen in a lmxb dipping source , we expect the spectral changes during dips can be explained by the addition of an absorbing component in the spectrum ( e.g. @xcite ) . to check this we fit the hard dip spectrum for the event shown in figure  [ fig : dip ] utilizing the same spectral parameters for the power - law , disk and absorption components for mjd 55469 as shown in figure  [ fig : spectral_evo ] , with the addition of a partial covering absorber ( xspec pcfabs model ) .",
    "we find that the hard dip spectrum is well fit ( @xmath96 for @xmath97 degrees of freedom ) by the addition of an additional partial covering absorber with @xmath98@xmath31 and a covering fraction of @xmath99 .",
    "we note that replacing the partial covering with a warm absorber model ( xspec absori model ) provides a slightly worse fit to the data ( @xmath100 for 34 degrees of freedom ) , suggesting that higher spectral resolution data would be required to determine the nature of the absorbing material .",
    "we therefore conclude that the spectral hardness changes seen during some of the dips events are likely caused by localized absorbing material in the disk .",
    "to search for longer timescale periodicities , we used the lomb - scargle method @xcite , which is effective when analyzing unevenly sampled data .",
    "longer term light - curve trends were removed by fitting a 3rd order polynomial .",
    "the resultant periodogram , derived from xrt wt data in the @xmath101kev band , shows a strong peak at @xmath3hours .",
    "this period is @xmath102 times the @xmath103 minute _ swift _  orbital period , however given the closeness of our result to the _ rxte _  measured periodicity @xcite , we conclude that it is not an aliasing effect .",
    "no periodicity was detected in the uvot data from this source , although as uvot data were taken in non - event mode for the majority of the observations , the uvot data are not sensitive to a 2.4 hr period .",
    "although periodic , the dip shapes are highly variable , suggesting that they may be caused by obscuration by optically thick clumps in the accretion flow , or an evolving bulge in the disk , rather than eclipsing by the companion star . given this scenario ,",
    "the 2.4hour periodicity is likely the orbital period of maxi  j1659@xmath0152 .",
    "without a measurement of @xmath104 for maxi  j1659@xmath0152 it is difficult to place strong limits on the orbital parameters of the system from the _ swift _  data alone .",
    "however , with knowledge of the period and other system parameters we can attempt to estimate distance and system geometry from theoretical and empirically derived relationships that have been established for lmxbs .    given that in the x - ray light - curve we see dips but not eclipses , from the standard model of x - ray binary geometry of @xcite , maxi  j1659@xmath0152 is analogous to a `` pure dipper '' , which constrains the inclination to @xmath105 .",
    "@xcite derive a simple relationship for the mass of the secondary star and the orbital period , @xmath106 , assuming that the companion star is filling its roche lobe and is an unevolved low - mass star .",
    "this gives us an estimate of the companion mass of @xmath107 .",
    "@xcite also derive an empirical linear mass - period relationship , which for @xmath108hours , gives @xmath109 , close to the previously derived value . assuming a black - hole primary , @xmath110",
    ", we estimate an upper limit on the mass ratio of @xmath111 .",
    "the faintest optical magnitude of maxi  j1659@xmath0152 seen by uvot is @xmath112 mag on mjd 55598 . as the out - of - outburst optical magnitude is fainter than @xmath29 , based on the non - detection in usno - b catalog",
    ", this suggests that the optical counterpart has not been observed by uvot in quiescence .",
    "therefore we can make no estimate , from the uvot data alone , of the brightness of the secondary star in this system .",
    "however , if we assume a main sequence companion , the relationship of spectral type versus period of @xcite allows us to estimate that the companion is a m5 star .",
    "m5 stars have typical absolute visual magnitudes of @xmath113 . @xcite",
    "derive a relationship for absolute visual magnitude of the companion star for a cataclysmic variable system as a function of the period , @xmath114 , assuming this relationship is valid for a bhb system , we estimate the brightness of the companion star to be @xmath115 . given that @xmath29 in quiescence , this places a lower - limit on the distance of @xmath116pc .",
    "note that this distance does not include and any extinction correction , which would make this distance estimate lower .",
    "however , the brightness of the x - ray outburst suggests that maxi  j1659@xmath0152 is much more distant than this , as the peak outburst flux of @xmath117 relates to luminosity of @xmath118 at 631pc for a black - hole mass of @xmath119 , and it is unlikely that the peak outburst would be so highly sub - eddington .",
    "if we assume the peak flux of maxi  j1659@xmath0152 equates to a bhb emitting at @xmath120 , we obtain a lower - limit on the distance of @xmath121kpc .",

    "the peak observed optical brightness for maxi  j1659@xmath0152 is @xmath50 , which gives estimated distances in the range of @xmath126kpc ( assuming galactic extinction , @xmath127 ) to @xmath128kpc ( no extinction ) .",
    "as an alternative measure of distance , we use the @xcite distance - period relationship for x - ray transients . with a peak outburst optical magnitude of @xmath50 , an estimated line - of - sight extinction of @xmath129 , and assuming the fraction of the optical emission in quiescence that comes from the companion star , @xmath130 , is @xmath131",
    ", we obtain a lower - limit on the distance to maxi  j1659@xmath0152 of @xmath132kpc , consistent with the @xmath133kpc derived above .",
    "given that the galactic latitude of maxi  j1659@xmath0152 is relatively high , @xmath134 , this would place the black - hole approximately at @xmath135kpc , which is above average , but not unprecedented ( for example xte  j1118@xmath56480 is at @xmath136kpc , @xcite ) and would place maxi  j1659@xmath0152 in a sub - class of high-@xmath137 short period galactic bhb , along with xte  j1118@xmath56480 , gro  j0422@xmath5632 ( e.g. @xcite ) and swift  j1753.6@xmath00127 ( e.g. @xcite ) in the galactic halo .    @xcite suggest a counterpart for maxi  j1659@xmath0152 with @xmath138 , based on archival data taken before the outburst . given a color correction of @xmath139 for an m5 star , and the expected extinction of @xmath140 @xcite ,",
    "we find an estimated @xmath20 magnitude for this counterpart of @xmath141 corrected for extinction . if we assume @xmath133kpc , we derive an absolute magnitude for the companion of @xmath142 , too bright for an m5 star .    @xcite find a relationship between the magnitude of the change in optical brightness of an x - ray transient in outburst and the orbital period , which predicts @xmath143 for a @xmath144hour orbital period .",
    "the maximum uvot observed @xmath19-band brightness of maxi  j1659@xmath0152 was @xmath50 , which would predict a quiescent optical brightness of @xmath145 .",
    "correcting for extinction and assuming a distance of @xmath133 kpc , gives an absolute magnitude estimate for the quiescent optical emission of @xmath146 , consistent with the estimate that the companion star is an m5 dwarf , but inconsistent with the suggested @xmath147-band counterpart .",
    "we therefore believe that the counterpart proposed by @xcite is likely an unrelated foreground object .",
    "the rise to peak and slow decay of the optical emission appears to be anti - correlated with the measurement of the spectral hardness of the source , suggesting a strong link between the optical brightness and the emission state of maxi  j1659@xmath0152 .",
    "this , along with the similar outburst profile of the hard x - ray bat and uvot light - curves , suggests that the majority of the optical emission is correlated to the comptonized component of the spectrum ( e.g. from an optically thin jet that becomes fainter as the x - ray spectrum becomes more thermally dominated , @xcite ) , rather than thermal optical emission from the disk itself .",
    "the correlated x - ray / optical behavior seen in maxi  j1659@xmath0152 is similar to the behavior observed previously in gx  339@xmath04 @xcite , although no rapid drop in the optical emission was detected as in that bhb .",
    "as the drop in optical flux in gx  339@xmath04 was consistent with the state transition to the thermal state , the lack of such a drop in maxi  j1659@xmath0152 is consistent with the fact that no such state transition was observed , and that the source remained in an intermediate state for the remainder of the _ swift _  observations .",
    "maxi  j1659@xmath0152 shows a rapid rise of the measured absorption in the initial part of the outburst , which we believe is the evolution of a localized absorbing medium , rather than a statistical artifact of the fitting .",
    "this observed increase of intrinsic absorption in the early stage outburst may be an indication of absorption by a thermally driven wind from the accretion disk ( e.g. @xcite ) or possibly a magnetic driven wind ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "an evolving disk wind , has also been suggested as a mechanism for variable absorption seen in agn @xcite .",
    "however , we note that high resolution x - ray spectral studies of the bhb have suggested that disk winds are not present in bhbs in the hard state ( e.g. @xcite ) , casting doubt on the disk - wind hypothesis during the early part of the outburst .",
    "variable absorption has been seen during the initial part of the outburst of the transient gs  2023@xmath56338 @xcite , who suggested a powerful outflowing wind was the cause of the intrinsic emission . unfortunately _",
    "swift_/xrt data are not of sufficiently high spectral energy resolution to resolve the expected absorption features of a wind",
    ". if the source of the emission is due to ionized plasma above the disk , which has been suggested to be a common feature of lmxbs from observations of dipping sources @xcite , it may also be the case that such an intrinsic absorption change may only be seen in sources with relatively high inclinations .",
    "the fact that this absorption increase is seen only in the very earliest part of the rapid rise to outburst , means that it is likely a poorly studied phenomenon , given the difficulty in catching this early part of the outburst with an x - ray telescope with sufficient low - energy sensitivity to measure absorption , and the relatively short - lived timescale of the change ( @xmath148days ) .",
    "therefore we believe that even if this is a common feature of bhb outbursts , it would not be common to observe this feature without the rapid triggering and slewing capabilities of an soft x - ray observatory such as _ swift _ , even if the rise of intrinsic absorption is a common feature in bhbs that are entering outburst . in this case , the _ swift _  dataset on maxi  j1659@xmath0152 represents a unique high cadence monitoring of the initial stages of a newly discovered bhb in outburst . for comparison",
    "another bhb that triggered bat , swift  j1753.5@xmath00127 , was only observed once for a short 1.3ks observation with xrt @xcite in the first 6 days after it was discovered by bat @xcite .",
    "the disk component of the spectrum shows significant evolution during the outburst , both in the fitted temperature and normalization .",
    "the normalization of the diskbb model is equivalent to @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is in units of kilometers , and @xmath151 is in units of 10 kpc , therefore although we can not directly measure the inner radius without making assumptions about the inclination and distance to maxi  j1659@xmath0152 , changes in the normalization during the outburst give a direct measure of the magnitude of the change of the inner disk radius as a function of both time and temperature .    between mjd 55465 and mjd 55475 the value of @xmath66 , the inner disk temperature , rises from @xmath152 to @xmath153kev .",
    "in that time the normalization reduces from @xmath154 on mjd 55466 to @xmath155 , suggesting that the inner disk radius reduces by a factor of @xmath156 in approximately 3days .",
    "studies of the inner disk radius of bhbs during in different emission states have suggested a correlation of the fitted @xmath150 and @xmath66 , and the suggested dependence of radius and temperature is given by @xmath157 @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : rootnormvstemp ] , we plot @xmath158 versus the @xmath66 , to demonstrate this correlation between the fitted temperature and the inner disk radius for maxi  j1659@xmath0152 . the best fit power - law model to these data",
    "is @xmath159 , lower than the expected @xmath160 , although the data are broadly consistent with the expected trend in the @xmath161kev range .",
    "we clearly observe a trend of a decrease in the inner disk radius both with rising @xmath66 and with time , suggesting that accretion disk is undergoing a rapid in - fall during the outburst of maxi  j1659@xmath0152 .    in the period where the flux from the accretion disk is the dominant spectral component ( mjd 55485 - mjd 55491 , the latter date being due to the end of _ swift _",
    "observations ) , the average diskbb normalization is @xmath162 , and is statistically consistent with being constant during this time .",
    "if we assume that this minimum normalization corresponds an accretion disk with an @xmath150 at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) of a non - spinning black - hole , then @xmath163 , where @xmath164 .",
    "we can estimate the mass of the black - hole by re - arranging equation 4 of @xcite as @xmath165 . utilizing this equation , the assumption that the inner disk radius is at the isco , our previously obtained lower - limit on the distance to maxi  j1659@xmath0152 of @xmath121kpc , and the allowed range of inclinations of @xmath166 , we find an estimated black - hole mass of @xmath167 to @xmath168 .",
    "this estimated mass is strongly dependent on the assumed radius of the isco , which in the case of a maximally spinning black - hole , can be as small as @xmath169 , therefore if we assume @xmath170 , this increases the estimated bh mass to @xmath171 to @xmath172 .",
    "larger distances increase the estimate of the black - hole mass .",
    "however , given the high galactic latitude , larger distances become increasingly unlikely due to the derived large distance of maxi  j1659@xmath0152 above the galactic plane , e.g.  @xmath173kpc for @xmath174kpc .",
    "_ swift _  and _ maxi _  have discovered a new bhb , maxi  j1659@xmath0152 .",
    "broadband high - cadence _ swift _",
    "monitoring of the outburst revealed the key spectral and timing signatures of bhbs , including the presence of time variable qpos and spectral evolution of the transient through canonical states associated with bhbs .",
    "maxi  j1659@xmath0152 has similarities to other bhbs , for example swift  j1753.5@xmath00127 , which has a similar outburst light - curve @xcite and the presence of a low - temperature disc component , with @xmath175 kev , during the hard state @xcite .",
    "the increasing flux contribution of the thermal disk component and rise of @xmath66 to @xmath71kev suggests evolution to the thermal state from the steep power - law state , although no full state transition was seen before observations ended . as the disk component becomes more prominent and hotter , the radius of the inner disk edge of the accretion disk shrinks , approximately following the expected @xmath157 dependence predicted by @xcite .    during the first day of observations",
    ", we recorded a rapid increase in the fitted @xmath76 , likely caused by localized absorption from an evolving disk wind .",
    "optically , maxi  j1659@xmath0152 shows a correlated rise with x - ray during the hard state with brightness peaking at the transition between the hard and steep power - law states , followed by a decrease in the optical brightness while in an intermediate state .",
    "we detect a @xmath7hour periodicity in the x - ray light - curve .",
    "the structure of the associated dips is highly variable from orbit to orbit , suggesting periodic obscuration from the accretion disk or stream .",

    "given the likely distance of @xmath133kpc , and the high galactic latitude , it is likely that maxi  j1659@xmath0152 , similar to swift  j1753.5@xmath00127 and other short period bhbs , is a galactic halo bhb .",
