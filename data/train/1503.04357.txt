    "<S> the constant @xmath84 is the rate of diffusive polarization transport among neighboring nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> it is quenched when the difference between the secular hyperfine interactions of the two spins , @xmath85 , is large and when the nuclear transverse relaxation rate @xmath66 is fast . </S>",
    "<S> comparing the polarization dynamics calculated via kmc with a simple diffusion model , @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the polarization field , indeed shows good agreement with data as the one presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](d ) . </S>",

    "<S> we conclude that polarization transport in a se dnp experiment is mediated by nuclear spin diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the electron will hinder  or constrain  this process for nuclei close to the electron since for these nuclei the difference between the strengths of the secular hyperfine interactions is significant @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we have derived effective equations of motions which show that the mechanism underlying se dnp is kinetically constrained diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> the derived set of equations enable the study polarization buildup in relatively large spin systems which has been demonstrated by investigating dnp in a system with 1330 @xmath1c nuclei and a single electron . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have highlighted the importance of nuclear dipolar couplings in se dnp and derived an effective rate for polarization diffusion in a one - dimensional chain . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that this study represents an important step in the quantitative understanding of se dnp for practical applications in nmr . in the future we will investigate </S>",
    "<S> whether the method presented here is also applicable in more complex settings , which involve e.g. more than a single electron .    </S>",
