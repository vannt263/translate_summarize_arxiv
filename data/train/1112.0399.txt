    "this paper is devoted to studying the stability of dynamical objects which are called by very different terms such as one - mode solutions ( omss )  @xcite , simple periodic orbits ( spos )  @xcite , low - dimensional solutions  @xcite , one - dimensional bushes  @xcite etc .",
    "below we refer to them as _ nonlinear normal modes _ ( nnms ) .",
    "let us comment on this terminology .",
    "the concept of similar nonlinear normal modes was developed by rosenberg many years ago  @xcite .",
    "each nnm represents a periodic vibrational regime in the conservative @xmath1-particle mechanical system for which the displacement @xmath2 of every particle is proportional to the displacement of an arbitrary chosen particle , say , the first particle [ @xmath3 at any instant @xmath4 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 are constant coefficients .",
    "note that convenient _ linear normal modes _ ( lnms ) also satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eqch1 ] ) since , for any such mode , one can write @xmath7 where @xmath8 are constant amplitudes of individual particles , while @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the frequency and initial phase of the considered mode .    as a rule",
    ", nnms can exist in the mechanical systems with rather specific interparticle interactions , for example , in systems whose potential energy represents a _ homogeneous _ function with respect to all its arguments .",
    "however , in some cases , the existence of nnms is caused by certain symmetry - related reasons .",
    "we refer to such dynamical objects as _ symmetry - determined _ nnms .    in  @xcite",
    ", we have found all symmetry - determined nnms in all @xmath1-particle mechanical systems with any of 230 space groups .",
    "this proved to be possible due to the group - theoretical methods developed in  @xcite for constructing _ bushes _ of vibrational modes .    at this point",
    ", it is worth to comment on the concept of bushes of modes introduced in  @xcite ( the theory of these dynamical objects can be found in  @xcite ) .    in rigorous mathematical sense",
    ", they represent symmetry - determined _ invariant manifolds _ decomposed into the basis vectors of _ irreducible representations _ of the symmetry group characterizing the considered mechanical system ( `` parent '' group ) .    because of the specific subject of the present paper , it is sufficient to consider only bushes of vibrational modes in nonlinear monoatomic chains .",
    "such bushes have been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "let us reproduce here some ideas and results from these papers .",
    "every bush b@xmath11 $ ] describes a certain vibrational regime , and some specific _ pattern _ of instantaneous displacements of all the particles of the mechanical system corresponds to it . in turn , this pattern is characterized by a symmetry group @xmath12 ( in particular , such group can be trivial ) which is a _ subgroup _ of the symmetry group @xmath13 of the mechanical system in its equilibrium state .",
    "for example , let us consider the _ two - dimensional _ bush b@xmath14 $ ] in the monoatomic chain with periodic boundary conditions whose displacement pattern @xmath15 can be written as follows @xmath16 this pattern is determined by two time - dependent functions @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and the corresponding _ vibrational state _ of the @xmath1-particle chain is fully described by displacements inside the _ primitive cell _ , which is four time larger than that of the equilibrium state .",
    "we will refer to the ratio of the primitive cell size of the vibrational state to that of the equilibrium state as _ multiplication number _",
    "( @xmath19 ) and , therefore , for the pattern  ( [ eqch3 ] ) , one can write @xmath20 .",
    "the symmetry group @xmath21}$ ] of the bush b@xmath14 $ ] is determined by two _ generators _ : the translation ( @xmath22 ) by four lattice spacing ( @xmath23 ) and the inversion ( @xmath24 ) with respect to the center of the chain ( note that the condition @xmath25 must hold for existence of such bush ) .",
    "if we decompose the displacement pattern  ( [ eqch3 ] ) into the linear normal coordinates @xmath26\\right|n=1 .. n\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & ( j=0 .. n-1),\\label{eqch10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we get the following form of the bush b@xmath14 $ ] in the _ modal space _ : @xmath27 where @xmath28 @xmath29 while @xmath30 and @xmath31 are time - dependent coefficients in front of the normal coordinates @xmath32 and  @xmath33 .",
    "thus , only @xmath34 normal coordinates from the full set  ( [ eqch10 ] ) contribute to the `` configuration vector '' @xmath15 corresponding to the given bush and we will refer to @xmath35 as the _ bush dimension_.    in  @xcite , we developed a simple crystallographic method for obtaining the displacement pattern  @xmath15 for any subgroup  @xmath12 of the parent group  @xmath13 . using this method one can obtain bushes of different dimensions for an arbitrary nonlinear chain .",
    "the _ one - dimensional bushes _",
    "( @xmath36 ) represent symmetry - determined nonlinear normal modes .",
    "the displacement pattern  @xmath15 corresponding to a given nnm depends on only one ( time - periodic ) function @xmath31 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a constant vector , which is formed by the coefficients @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) from eq .",
    "( [ eqch1 ] ) , while the function @xmath31 satisfies a certain differential equation .",
    "this so - called `` governing '' equation can be obtained by substitution of the ansatz  ( [ eqch20 ] ) into the dynamical equations of the considered chain .    in some sense",
    ", the concept of bushes of vibrational modes can be considered as a certain _ generalization _ of the notion of nnms by rosenberg . indeed , if we substitute the ansatz  ( [ eqch12 ] ) into dynamical equations of the chain , we obviously get two `` governing '' equations for the functions @xmath31 and @xmath30 , that determines the above - discussed two - dimensional bush ( note that , in contrast to a nnm , such dynamical object describes , in general , a _",
    "motion ) . finally , one can conclude that @xmath35-dimensional bush is determined by @xmath35 time - dependent functions for which @xmath35 governing differential equations can be obtained from the dynamical equations of the considered mechanical system .",
    "let us emphasize that bushes of modes represent a new type of _ exact _ excitations in nonlinear systems with discrete symmetries and the excitation energy proves to be trapped in a given bush for the case of hamiltonian systems .",
    "it is very important to emphasize that there exist only a _ finite number _ of vibrational bushes of any fixed dimension in every @xmath1-particle mechanical system . as a consequence",
    ", there is sufficiently small number of nnms ( one - dimensional bushes ) in the fpu chains ( three nnms for the fpu-@xmath41 model and six  for the fpu-@xmath0 model ) .",
    "all possible one - dimensional bushes are explicitly listed in our papers  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the stability of some nnms in the fpu chains has been studied in  @xcite by numerical and analytical methods .",
    "let us comment explicitly on the recent papers  @xcite .",
    "in  @xcite , t.  bountis and coworkers have investigated the destabilization thresholds ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) of two nonlinear normal modes which they call spo-1 and spo-2 ( simple periodic orbits ) by numerical methods .",
    "the authors of the above papers try to reveal some relations between the destabilization thresholds @xmath42 , @xmath43 and the origin of the weak chaos in connection with the famous fermi - pasta - ulam problem of the energy equipartition between different modes . in particular , they conclude that the main role in the weak chaos appearance in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath44 ) plays spo-2 , because @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and , therefore , @xmath47 .    however , there are some other spos in the fpu-@xmath0 chain and one can be interested in their role in the origin of the weak chaos in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "some comments are appropriate at this point .    according to lyapunov  @xcite , some strictly periodic orbits for nonlinear systems",
    "can be obtained from the linear normal modes ( which are introduced in the harmonic approximation ) by continuation with respect to a parameter characterizing the strength of nonlinearity . from this point of view , there exist @xmath1 different spos for longitudinal vibrations of an @xmath1 particle monoatomic chain .",
    "however , only few of the modes , constructed in such a way , possess an _",
    "identical _ time dependence of the displacements of all the particles .",
    "more exactly , only few of the lyapunov modes can be written in the form  ( [ eqch20 ] ) implying a separation of time and space variables that is typical for the rosenberg nonlinear normal modes . indeed , in general case , @xmath48 where @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) are _ different _ functions of time with identical periods .",
    "note that in the present paper we consider only _ extended _ spos , but the same problem there exists for _ localized _ periodic modes ( discrete breathers ) and we have discussed it in detail in  @xcite .",
    "as far as we aware , all periodic solutions in monoatomic chains that have been studied up to now ( see the above cited papers  @xcite and references therein ) belong namely to the class of the rosenberg nonlinear normal modes determined by eq .",
    "( [ eqch20 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the spatial profiles @xmath51 of these modes possess certain symmetry properties . in particular",
    ", every such mode can be characterized by a multiplication number ( @xmath19 ) determining the enlargement of the primitive cell of the vibrational state in comparison with that of the equilibrium state .",
    "as was already noted , we refer to these modes as symmetry - determined nnms and there exist only finite number of such modes ( even for the case @xmath44 ! ) for each nonlinear chain  @xcite .    above considered",
    "spo-1 , spo-2 and the well - known @xmath52-mode ( zone boundary mode ) represent nnms with multiplication numbers 4 , 3 , and 2 , respectively . however , among _ six _ symmetry - determined nnms in the fpu-@xmath0 chain  @xcite there exist another three nnms with @xmath53 , @xmath20 and @xmath54 .",
    "the stability properties of the second nnm with @xmath20 were studied by m.  leo and r.a .",
    "leo in  @xcite .",
    "the stability of this mode was investigated in the thermodynamic limit by both numerical and analytical methods .",
    "the stability diagrams for all the nonlinear normal modes in the fpu-@xmath0 chain , as well as for the fpu-@xmath41 chain , can be found in our paper  @xcite . with the aid of these diagrams",
    ", one may reveal many stability properties of nnms for an arbitrary @xmath1 , in particular , for the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "note that these diagrams were obtained numerically .    in this paper",
    ", we present some _ analytical _ results for the stability properties of all nnms in the fpu-@xmath0 chain in the _ thermodynamic _ limit ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "we also compare our results with those by different authors when it is possible .    in sec .  2",
    ", we consider all the possible symmetry - determined nonlinear normal modes in the fpu-@xmath0 chain . in sec .",
    "3 , the stability diagrams for these nnms are discussed . in sec .  4 , the analytical method for studying the stability of nnms in the thermodynamic limit is presented . in sec .  5 , we list our results on the stability properties for every nnm .",
    "as was already mentioned , there exists only _",
    "finite _ number of symmetry - determined nnms in any monoatomic chain .",
    "every nnm corresponds to a certain _ subgroup _ of the symmetry group of the chain dynamical equations .",
    "the difference in the number of nonlinear normal modes for the fpu-@xmath41 chain ( three nnms ) and the fpu-@xmath0 chain ( six nnms ) is associated with the fact that the symmetry group of the fpu-@xmath0 chain dynamical equations is higher than that of the fpu-@xmath41 chain  @xcite .    in  @xcite , we have investigated the stability of all nnms both in the fpu-@xmath41 and fpu-@xmath0 chains ( for the case @xmath55 ) by numerical methods .",
    "let us comment on the main idea of this investigation .    following the standard method of the linear stability analysis , we linearize the fpu-@xmath0 dynamical equations near a given nnm and get the linearized system in the form @xmath56 , where @xmath57 represents the infinitesimal perturbation vector , while @xmath58 is the jacobian matrix of the original system of nonlinear differential equations .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath1 linear differential equations with time - periodic coefficients depending on the considered nnm",
    ". then the floquet method can be applied for studying the stability of the zero solution of the system  @xmath56 .",
    "however , such straightforward way for the stability analyzing becomes practically impossible for @xmath59 . in  @xcite",
    ", the general group - theoretical method has been developed for splitting ( decomposition ) of the original system @xmath56 of @xmath1 linear differential equations into certain subsystems of sufficiently small dimensions @xmath60 .",
    "for the fpu-@xmath0 chain , these dimensions do not exceed three ( see below ) .",
    "then we have applied the floquet method for such subsystems of small dimensions . moreover , proceeding in this manner , one can reveal those subsets of the vibrational modes , which are responsible for the loss of stability of the considered nnm . as a consequence of this approach",
    ", it proves to be possible to construct very transparent diagrams , which demonstrate explicitly stability properties of each fpu nonlinear normal mode  @xcite .",
    "the fpu-@xmath0 model represents a chain of unit masses coupled with each other by the appropriate nonlinear springs .",
    "the dynamical equations describing longitudinal vibrations of the fpu-@xmath0 chain can be written in the form @xmath61 where @xmath2 is the displacement of the @xmath24th particle from its equilibrium state at the instant @xmath4 , while the force @xmath62 depends on the spring deformation @xmath63 as @xmath64 the periodic boundary condition is assumed to hold : @xmath65    let us mention some results of the paper  @xcite , which are necessary for our further discussions .",
