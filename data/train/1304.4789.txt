    "negative thermal expansion ( nte ) is a rare and counter - intuitive phenomenon found primarily in low density materials with crystal structures that are networks of linked coordination polyhedra .",
    "the study of these materials is not only of fundamental scientific importance , but also has many technological applications such as aerospace technologies  @xcite , optics  @xcite , and electronics  @xcite .",
    "while much effort has been put into finding new materials and investigating the origin of nte in them , much less attention has been paid to the change in nte behaviour subject to heating and stress , which holds great importance for the possible applications of the material .",

    "thirdly , with previous dft calculations of zn(cn)@xmath0 @xcite explaining the origin of nte of the material in terms of grneisen theory , it would be useful to draw a clear link between the values of the grneisen parameters in energy space and the structural vibrations in real space with full anharmonicity ( which should be important in such an nte system ) based on theoretically reproducing the aforementioned exotic properties .    here ,",
    "we have built a zn(cn)@xmath0 potential model based on first - principles calculations .",
    "lattice - dynamic calculations and large - scale molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations were carried out for the material using this model which was justified by comparing against the available experimental data .",

    "the ta modes around 0.5 thz spanning to the lowest energy correspond to collective motions of zn  cn  zn as a rigid body , which can keep the distance of the nearest - neighbour zincs . the low energy hence the most negative grneisen parameters of these modes",

    "although the increase of pressure or temperature would both result in volume contraction in zn(cn)@xmath0 , the pressure and temperature dependence of the nte in zn(cn)@xmath0 are totally different .",
