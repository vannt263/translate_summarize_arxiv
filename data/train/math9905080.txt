    "the study of formal ( 1-differentiable ) deformations of the lie - poisson algebra of functions on a symplectic manifold was initiated in a paper by m.  flato , a.  lichnerowicz and d.  sternheimer  @xcite . shortly afterwards , this program was extended to star - products , i.e. , associative deformation of the usual product of functions , on a symplectic manifold @xcite giving , among others , a profound interpretation of quantum mechanics as a deformation of classical mechanics in the direction of the poisson bracket .",
    "the existence problem of star - products has been solved by successive steps from special classes of symplectic manifolds to general poisson manifolds .",
    "the existence of star - products on any finite dimensional symplectic manifold was first shown by m.  de  wilde and p.  lecomte  @xcite . since then",
    ", more geometric proofs have appeared @xcite , and a proof of existence for regular poisson manifolds was published by m.  masmoudi  @xcite .    for the non - regular poisson case",
    ", first examples of star - products appeared in @xcite in relation with the quantization of angular momentum .",
    "they were defined on the dual of @xmath3 endowed with its natural kirillov - poisson structure .",
    "the case for any lie algebra follows from the construction given by s.  gutt @xcite of a star - product on the cotangent bundle of a lie group @xmath4 .",
    "this star - product restricts to a star - product on the dual of the lie algebra of @xmath4 .",
    "it translates the associative structure of the enveloping algebra in terms of functions on the dual of the lie algebra of @xmath4 .",
    "the problem of existence of star - products on any finite dimensional poisson manifold was given a solution by m.  kontsevich @xcite .",
    "the proof is based on an explicit expression of a star - product on @xmath5 endowed with a general poisson bracket , which itself follows from more general formulae which allowed him to show his formality conjecture @xcite for @xmath5 and then for any finite dimensional manifold @xmath6 .",
    "recently , by using different techniques , d.  tamarkin @xcite has indicated another proof of the formality conjecture .",
    "this is one of the ingredients in the most recent fundamental paper by m.  kontsevich  @xcite .    on the dual of a lie algebra",
    ", we have a priori two different star - products : gutt and kontsevich star - products .",
    "d.  arnal @xcite showed that when the lie algebra is nilpotent , these two star - products do coincide .",
    "here we shall give an elementary proof that in the general case gutt and kontsevich star - products are equivalent and explicitly construct the equivalence between them .",
    "for that purpose , we use the notion of weyl star - products on @xmath5 .",
    "these are star - products enjoying the following property : @xmath7 ( @xmath8 factors ) is equal to @xmath9 ( usual product ) for any linear polynomial @xmath10on @xmath5 and @xmath11 .",
    "any star - product on @xmath5 is equivalent to a weyl star - product and , in the case of the dual of a lie algebra , gutt star - product is the unique covariant weyl star - product .",
    "from this fact , one immediately obtains that kontsevich and gutt star - products are equivalent .",
    "the equivalence operator is obtained by applying a method used in @xcite in the context of generalized abelian deformations .",
    "it turns out that the equivalence operator is an exponential of constant coefficients linear operators given by the trace of powers of the adjoint map of the lie algebra .",
    "the formula we have found is closely related to the discussion given in @xcite about lie algebras .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we review kontsevich construction in section",
    "then we proceed to the study of weyl star - products on @xmath5 and get a characterization of gutt star - product .",
    "the main results about equivalence is proved in section  4 .",
    "we end the paper with some remarks on the general poisson case .",
    "since the first version of this paper was completed , several preprints dealing with kontsevich star - product on the dual of a lie algebra have appeared @xcite .",
    "the equivalence result found here has also been obtained by d.  arnal , n.  ben amar , and m.  masmoudi @xcite in a completely different approach involving cohomology of kontsevich graphs .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for the general theory on star - products and to the excellent review by d.  sternheimer @xcite for further details and recent applications .",
    "we shall briefly review the construction of a star - product on @xmath5 given in @xcite . consider @xmath5 endowed with a poisson bracket @xmath12 .",
    "we denote by @xmath13 the coordinate system on @xmath5 , the poisson bracket of two smooth functions @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes the partial derivative with respect to @xmath17",
    ". what follows remain valid if , instead of the whole of @xmath5 , one considers an open subset of it .",
    "we slightly depart from the notations used in @xcite .    the formula for kontsevich star - product is conveniently defined by considering , for each @xmath18 , a family of oriented graphs @xmath19 .",
    "to a graph @xmath20 is associated a bidifferential operator @xmath21 and a weight @xmath22 .",
    "the sum @xmath23 gives us the term at order  @xmath24 , i.e. , the cochain @xmath25 of the star - product .",
    "here is the formal definition of @xmath19 .",
    "an oriented graph @xmath26 belongs to @xmath19 , @xmath18 , if :    * @xmath26 has @xmath27 vertices labeled @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 stand for left and right , respectively , and @xmath26 has @xmath31 oriented edges labeled @xmath32 ; * the pair of edges @xmath33 , @xmath34 , starts at vertex  @xmath8 ; * @xmath26 has no loop ( edge starting at some vertex and ending at that vertex ) and no parallel multiple edges ( edges sharing the same starting and ending vertices ) .",
    "when it is needed to make explicit at which vertex @xmath35 some edge , e.g. @xmath36 , is ending at , we shall use the notation @xmath37 .",
    "the set of graphs in @xmath19 is finite . for @xmath38 ,",
    "the first edge @xmath39 starting at vertex @xmath8 has @xmath40 possible ending vertices ( since there is no loop ) , while the second edge @xmath36 has only @xmath41 possible ending vertices , since there is no parallel multiple edges .",
    "thus there are @xmath42 ways to draw the pair of edges starting at some vertex and therefore @xmath19 has @xmath43 elements . for @xmath44 , @xmath45 has only one element : the graph having as set of vertices @xmath46 and no edges .    a bidifferential operator @xmath47 , @xmath48 , is associated to each graph @xmath49 , @xmath38 .",
    "to each vertex  @xmath8 , @xmath50 , one associates the components @xmath51 of the poisson tensor , @xmath52 is associated to the vertex  @xmath29 and @xmath53 to the vertex @xmath30 .",
    "each edge , e.g. @xmath54 acts by partial differentiation with respect to @xmath55 on its ending vertex  @xmath56 .",
    "there is no better way than to draw the graph @xmath26 to illustrate the correspondence @xmath57 .",
    "see @xcite for a general formula .",
    "the graph in fig .",
    "1 gives the bidifferential operator @xmath58 notice that for @xmath44 , we simply have the usual product of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "now let us describe how the weight @xmath59 of a graph @xmath26 is defined .",
    "again the reader is referred to @xcite for details and a nice geometrical interpretation of what follows .",
    "let @xmath60 be the upper half - plane .",
    "@xmath61 will denote the configuration space @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath61 is an open submanifold of @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath64 be the function : @xmath65 @xmath66 is extended by continuity for @xmath67 , @xmath68 .    for a graph @xmath49 , the vertex @xmath8 , @xmath50 ,",
    "is associated with the variable @xmath69 , the vertex @xmath29 with @xmath70 , and the vertex @xmath30 with @xmath71 .    the weight @xmath59 is defined by integrating an @xmath31-form over @xmath61 : @xmath72 where @xmath73 ( resp .",
    "@xmath74 ) denotes the variable or real number associated with the ending vertex of the edge @xmath39 ( resp .",
    "@xmath36 ) . for example ,",
    "the weight of the graph in fig .  1 consists in integrating the @xmath75-form @xmath76 on @xmath77 .",
    "it is clear from the definition of the weights that they are universal in the sense that they do not depend on the poisson structure or the dimension  @xmath1 .",
    "the origin of the weights has been elucidated by a.  s.  cattaneo and g.  felder @xcite .",
    "these authors have been able to construct a bosonic topological field theory on a disc whose perturbation series ( after a finite renormalization taking care of tadpoles ) makes kontsevich graphs and weights appear explicitly .    it is showed in @xcite that the integral in eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) is absolutely convergent .",
    "a pillar result in @xcite is    [ konsi ] for any poisson structure @xmath12 on @xmath5 , the map @xmath78 defines an associative product .",
    "we call this product the kontsevich star - product and it will be denoted by @xmath79 and the corresponding cochains by @xmath80 . actually the preceding theorem holds if @xmath12 is replaced by any formal poisson bracket @xmath81 .",
    "moreover , equivalence classes of star - products are in one - to - one correspondence with equivalence classes of formal poisson brackets @xcite .",
    "at first it may seem that any computation involving the graphs becomes rapidly cumbersome as @xmath82 .",
    "but the situation is not that bad , there are many isomorphic graphs obtained by permuting the vertices or interchanging the edges @xmath83 .",
    "these operations do not affect @xmath84 as each factor picks up a minus sign .",
    "also in @xmath19 , @xmath85 , there are `` bad '' graphs that can be eliminated right away .",
    "these graphs are those for which the vertices @xmath29 or @xmath30 ( or both ) do not receive any edge . as it should , the weights associated to these graphs vanish .",
    "we will illustrate that by giving the explicit form of the second cochain @xmath86 which requires at the end the computation of only @xmath87 graphs ( notice that @xmath88 ) .    the graphs in fig .",
    "2 have weights @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 . by counting the symmetries",

    "taking into account that there are @xmath95 `` bad '' graphs , we a have a total of @xmath98 graphs , and we find that : @xmath99 where summation over repeated indices is understood .",
