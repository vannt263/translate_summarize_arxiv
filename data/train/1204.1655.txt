    "we calculated magneto - hydrodynamical simulations with neutrino effects included and investigated the @xmath1-process nucleosynthesis during the purely magnetohydrodynamic explosion in a massive star of 13 @xmath2 progenitor model by @xcite .",
    "weak differential rotation model does not succeed in explosion .",
    "so , explosion need very strong and concentrated rotation , and magnetic field . low @xmath3 ejecta from which the third peak elements appear needs strong differential rotation and concentrated magnetic field .",
    "explosion depend on the parameter of magnetic field and rotation profile and @xmath3 distribution of ejecta is very different , which depend on each parameter . for model 5 ,",
    "third peak can be reprocuced but the second peak is low because @xmath3 distribution as a function of radius is steep .",
