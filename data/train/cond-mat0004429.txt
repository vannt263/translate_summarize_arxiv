    "following a quench at low temperature , bistable `` ferromagnetic '' systems usually exhibit domain coarsening dynamics . this phase separation process has been observed in various experimental setups , as well as in numerous model systems @xcite .",
    "the ising model and its continuous counterpart , the so - called time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) equation are usually taken as paradigms of non - conservative coarsening dynamics @xcite .",
    "but many other systems , e.g. the diffusion equation , also exhibit phase - ordering dynamics once suitable `` phases '' are defined ( for the diffusion equation , one can for instance consider the sign of a zero - mean field ) .",
    "spatially - extended chaotic systems such as coupled map lattices ( cmls ) can also exhibit coarsening transients , after which one chaotic phase dominates another , leaving the system in a long - range ordered state that is usually accompanied by a non - trivial evolution of spatially - averaged quantities @xcite .",
    "the standard theory of domain coarsening predicts that , in general , the correlation length @xmath0 grows algebraically in time , @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the exponent usually takes the value @xmath2 in systems with a non - conserved , scalar order parameter when the domain growth is driven by curvature .",
    "this universality of domain growth processes is now well established .",
    "another important quantifier of phase ordering dynamics is persistence @xcite , defined , e.g. , as the fraction of space that has remained in the same phase since some given initial time @xmath3 .",
    "persistence is seen to decay algebraically @xmath4 with exponent @xmath5 in systems with algebraic domain growth , reflecting the stationarity of two - time correlations expressed in logarithmic time . as a matter of fact",
    ", the correlation length @xmath0 provides a better , `` natural '' measure of time , by which persistence decays as @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 ) even in systems with , say , logarithmic growth of domains .",
    "the ( degree of ) universality of persistence exponents is still largely an open question today .",
    "even models as close to each other as the zero - temperature ising model and the tdgl equation they share the same exponent @xmath2 , the same structure function , the same fisher - huse exponent seem to possess different persistence exponents ( currently available measurements give @xmath8 for tdgl @xcite and @xmath9 for ising @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , since it depends on the whole history of each point in the space , persistence is a rather complex , non - local quantity . exact or approximate values of persistence exponents are usually not simple numbers . understanding the extent to which persistence properties are universal is one of the challenging problems of modern statistical physics .",
    "it is also important from an experimental point of view , since persistence is an easily measurable quantifier of phase ordering . one can hope to bring new light to this problem by studying non - conventional models like cmls . in a sense ,",
    "they are not constrained as are traditional models : their local dynamics can not be rigorously reduced to that of standard models : there is no hamiltonian , no detailed balance , and they have been shown ( numerically ) to exhibit ising - like phase transitions with critical exponents that are significantly different from those of the ising model @xcite .    in  @xcite , domain growth has been studied in simple cmls .",
    "numerical simulations showed the expected scaling behavior , but with exponents @xmath10 and @xmath5 continuously varying with the strength of the diffusive coupling between chaotic units , although @xmath11 was found to be universal .",
    "it was also found that `` normal '' , tdgl , values were recovered in the continuous space limit of cmls , suggesting that a role is played by lattice effects .    in this article , we come back to these somewhat surprising results and study in some detail the dynamics of the interfaces delimiting domains , in order to unravel the origin of the peculiar behavior observed on more global quantities , such as @xmath0 .",
