    "one of the main problems in quantum chaos is the understanding of the semiclassical behaviour of the eigenfunctions of quantum dynamical systems having a chaotic classical limit .",
    "the main theorem in this context is the schnirelman theorem @xcite .",
    "it roughly states that `` most '' eigenfunctions equidistribute on the available phase space in the classical limit .",
    "this leaves open the question of the existence of exceptional sequences of eigenfunctions with a different limit . in the case of `` hard chaos '' ( uniformly hyperbolic systems ) ,",
    "numerical computations have shown the presence of `` scars '' on certain eigenfunctions @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ a visual enhancement of the wavefunction on an unstable periodic orbit . up to now",
    "all theories of this phenomenon have required some kind of averaging over a ( semiclassically large ) set of eigenfunctions @xcite .",
    "in addition , scarring is often described in the physics literature as a weak type of localization , compatible with schnirelman s ( measure - theoretic ) equidistribution , as opposed to `` strong scarring '' @xcite , which implies that the limiting measure has a component supported on a periodic orbit and therefore does not equidistribute .",
    "we show in this paper that , for the quantized `` arnold s cat map '' , strongly scarred sequences do indeed exist for any periodic orbit ( more generally , for any finite union of periodic orbits ) .",
    "this is , to the best of our knowledge , the first example of this kind in hyperbolic systems .",
    "a construction of exceptional sequences of eigenfunctions not equidistributing in the semiclassical limit was recently announced @xcite for the quantization of certain ergodic piecewise affine transformations on the torus , but these do not correspond to `` scars '' since the systems in question have no periodic orbits .",
    "our construction is based on intuitively clear ideas that we now briefly sketch . for unfamiliar notation",
    ", we refer to sections [ sec : linearcldyn][s : cohstat ] .",
    "precise statements of our results will be given below .",
    "let @xmath2 sl@xmath3 be a hyperbolic automorphism of the 2-dimensional torus @xmath4 and @xmath5 its quantization on the @xmath6-dimensional quantum hilbert space @xmath7 , where @xmath8 .",
    "we will construct strongly scarred quasimodes of @xmath5 that , for certain values of @xmath6 , will be shown to be eigenfunctions .",
    "for that purpose we will use three ingredients .",
    "first , the time - energy uncertainty relation in the following simple form ( @xmath9 ) : @xmath10 second , precise estimates on intuitively clear phase space localization properties of coherent states .",
    "third , a remark on the quantum period of @xmath11 @xcite ( section [ s : min quantum period ] ) .",
    "let @xmath12 be a periodic orbit of period @xmath13 of @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 be a `` squeezed '' coherent state in @xmath16 centered on the point @xmath17 and consider @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "note first that this state is still a squeezed coherent state and that , for small enough @xmath20 , it is localized around @xmath21 . in fact , the support of the husimi function of this state is an ellipse stretched along the unstable direction of the dynamics through the point @xmath21 , with its major axis roughly of size @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the ( positive ) lyapounov exponent of the dynamics ( section [ s : cohstat ] ) .",
    "introducing the ehrenfest time @xmath24 , the support is therefore microscopic as long as @xmath25 . for longer times , between @xmath26 and @xmath27 ,",
    "the support of the husimi function of @xmath28 starts to wrap around the torus and it was shown in @xcite that it equidistributes on that time scale .",
    "we shall consider the `` discrete time quasimode '' @xmath29 and its `` components '' @xmath30 we note that similar states were considered before in the study of scars , see for instance @xcite and references therein .",
    "we shall introduce a `` continuous time '' version @xmath31 of those quasimodes later .",
    "we will write @xmath32 in statements true for both the discrete and continuous time quasimodes .",
    "let us for simplicity concentrate on the case where @xmath33 .",
    "our crucial technical estimate ( section [ s : cohstat]proposition [ prop : crucial ] ) says that there exists @xmath34 so that @xmath35 this implies rather easily ( proposition [ prop : ortho ] ) the existence of a smooth , strictly positive function @xmath36 so that @xmath37 using ( [ eq : uncrel ] ) one concludes readily that @xmath38 justifying the name `` quasimode '' .",
    "here we used the notation @xmath39 .    to analyze the phase space properties of the above quasimodes , we first show as a further consequence of ( [ eq : crucial ] ) that the four states @xmath40 have the same norm , asymptotically proportional to @xmath41 as @xmath1 goes to @xmath42 and that they are asymptotically orthogonal in the semiclassical limit .",
    "in fact , this is easily understood intuitively by noting for example that the husimi function of @xmath43 is supported along the stable manifold of the periodic orbit , and that of @xmath44 along the unstable one , so that they have essentially disjoint supports , which is at the origin of their orthogonality . to put it differently , since the unstable and stable manifolds intersect at homoclinic points , our results show that the contribution of these intersections in the phase space integral expressing the overlap @xmath45 is small for small @xmath1 .",
    "note that although the homoclinic interferences do not contribute significantly to the above integral , they are nevertheless clearly visible on the pointwise behaviour of the husimi distribution of @xmath32 , which is represented in figure  [ f : quasimode ] and that will be further studied in section [ s : pointwise ] ( for `` continuous time '' quasimodes ) .",
    "the pointwise estimates obtained there will show that the husimi density concentrates along `` classical hyperbolas '' asymptotic to the stable and unstable manifolds ; they will at the same time provide estimates on the rate of convergence to the limit measure , as well as other localization indicators ( namely , @xmath46 norms of the husimi density ) .",
    "it is furthermore clear from the previous discussion on the phase space localization properties of the evolved coherent states that @xmath43 and @xmath44 are sums of states that equidistribute on the torus , whereas @xmath47 and @xmath48 are sums of states that localize on the periodic orbit .",
    "one therefore expects ( and we shall prove in sections  [ s : quasimodes][s : other_orbit ] ) that @xmath49 and that @xmath50 here @xmath51 is either the weyl or anti - wick quantization of @xmath52 .",
    "in other words , the wigner and hence also the husimi function of @xmath53 converge ( weakly ) to the dirac measure on the periodic orbit , whereas the ones of @xmath54 equidistribute , _",
    "i.e. _ converge to the lebesgue measure .",
    "this suggests grouping these states two by two , defining : @xmath55    using the above information we shall finally prove ( propositions [ prop : semiclassical properties of phi_tot ] and [ prop : qmell ] ) that , for any @xmath56 $ ] , @xmath57.\\ ] ] in other words , the semiclassical limit measure of the sequence of quasimodes @xmath58 is the measure @xmath59.\\ ] ] this shows that the quasimodes @xmath58 are strongly scarred .",
    "we then conclude using a particular property of the quantum period of @xmath11 .",
    "we recall that the quantum cat map @xmath5 has an @xmath1 dependent `` quantum period '' @xmath60 , _ i.e. _ @xmath61 for some @xmath62 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath5 on @xmath16 are therefore all of the form @xmath63 , with @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "note that @xmath60 plays the role here of the heisenberg time of the system , since @xmath66 .",
    "since , for general @xmath1 , the quantum period @xmath60 is of order @xmath67 @xcite , it is considerably longer than the ehrenfest time @xmath27 , which grows only logarithmically in @xmath67 . nevertheless ,",
    "developing an argument in @xcite , we will show that , for any hyperbolic matrix in sl@xmath3 there exists a subsequence @xmath68 of values of @xmath1 tending to zero for which @xmath69 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "for those values the heisenberg and ehrenfest times of the system coincide and the @xmath58 therefore constitute a sequence of eigenfunctions of @xmath5 that strongly scar , provided @xmath70 for some @xmath71 .",
    "it should be noted that , for the values of @xmath1 considered , the number of distinct eigenvalues @xmath72 is of order @xmath73 , so that the eigenvalue degeneracy is very large , namely of order @xmath74 .",
    "our main result can finally be summarized as follows :    [ th : betascar ] let @xmath14 and @xmath68 be as above .",
    "let @xmath75 and let @xmath76 be a periodic orbit of @xmath14 .",
    "then there exists a sequence @xmath77 of eigenfunctions of @xmath5 on @xmath78 with the property that , for all @xmath79 , @xmath80    our result helps to complete the picture of the semiclassical eigenfunction behaviour of quantized toral automorphisms known to date .",
    "indeed , beyond the general schnirelman theorem for these models @xcite the following results are known .",
    "first , suppose @xmath14 is of `` checkerboard form '' , meaning @xmath81 .",
    "then all eigenfunctions of @xmath5 semiclassically equidistribute , provided one takes the limit along a density one subsequence of values of @xmath6 @xcite , for which the quantum period is larger than @xmath82 .",
    "note that this sequence excludes the values @xmath83 for which the period is very short .",
    "second , it is shown in @xcite that for such @xmath14 there exists a basis of eigenfunctions that equidistribute as @xmath6 tends to infinity , without restrictions on @xmath6 . this basis is constructed as a common eigenbasis for @xmath5 and its `` quantum symmetries '' , which are shown in @xcite to be sufficiently numerous to drastically reduce ( if not to lift ) the degeneracies of the eigenvalues .",
    "finally , one may wonder if it would be possible to construct a sequence of eigenfunctions of @xmath5 that has as a limit measure @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "it is proven in @xcite that this is impossible , so that the above quasimodes are in a sense maximally localized ( the bound @xmath86 had been previously obtained by @xcite ) .",
    "in this section we recall some known results we will need in the sequel . for details not given here we refer to @xcite .      the most general quadratic hamiltonian on @xmath87 is ( @xmath88 : @xmath89 assuming @xmath90 , @xmath91 generates a hyperbolic flow @xmath92 on @xmath93 , given by @xmath94 , where for each @xmath95 , @xmath96 is a hyperbolic matrix in sl@xmath97 .",
    "explicitly , for @xmath98 @xmath99 _ i.e. _ @xmath100 , and @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the lyapounov exponent .",
    "note that @xmath14 has two real eigenvalues @xmath103 and hence two real eigenvectors corresponding to an unstable and a stable direction for the dynamics .",
    "they have respective slopes @xmath104 .",
    "clearly , any hyperbolic matrix @xmath2 sl@xmath97 with tr@xmath105 is of the above form for a unique @xmath106 ( the case tr@xmath107 is treated by using the map @xmath108 ) .",
    "the expressions in ( [ eq : m])([eq : hyperb ] ) still make sense in the elliptic case , when @xmath109 and @xmath110tr@xmath111 . in terms of the complex coordinate @xmath112 , the hamiltonian in ( [ eq : hamilt ] ) reads @xmath113 and @xmath114 we shall write @xmath115 for the matrix @xmath14 constructed via ( [ eq : m])([eq : compl ] ) , whenever @xmath116 .",
    "we will make use of the following convenient decomposition of a general hyperbolic matrix @xmath14 ( tr@xmath105 ) .",
    "we first introduce some notation .",
    "for @xmath117 we define :    @xmath118 clearly , @xmath119 is hyperbolic , with the @xmath120 and @xmath121 axes as unstable and stable axes .",
    "@xmath122 is also hyperbolic , with eigenaxes forming angles @xmath123 with the horizontal .",
    "@xmath124 , on the other hand , is just a rotation of angle @xmath125 and hence elliptic .",
    "any hyperbolic matrix @xmath115 as in ( [ eq : m ] ) can be decomposed as : @xmath126 where @xmath127 $ ] , @xmath128 are defined as follows .",
    "we denote by @xmath129 $ ] the angle between the @xmath120 axis and the bisector between the stable and unstable axes of @xmath115 , and by @xmath130 0,\\frac{\\pi } { 4}\\right ] $ ] the angle between the bisector and the stable axis of @xmath115 ( figure  [ f : decomposition ] ) . in terms of those",
    ", one has : @xmath131    this last decomposition has the following interpretation . the general hyperbolic map @xmath115 is obtained from the special case @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) by a change of coordinates @xmath134 yielding a transformation from the @xmath135 frame into the unstable - stable frame .",
    "the unstable ( respectively stable ) direction is given by the vectors @xmath136 , @xmath137 ( which are , in general , not normalized ) .",
    "above , we decomposed @xmath134 into the transformation @xmath138 which changes the angle between the stable and unstable axis , and the rotation @xmath139 which rotates the whole frame ( figure  [ f : decomposition ] )",
    ".    we finally remark , for later purposes , that there exists another decomposition : given @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142-\\pi , \\pi]$ ] so that @xmath143      in terms of the usual annihilation and number operators @xmath144 , and @xmath145 the weyl ( or canonical ) quantization of @xmath91 in ( [ eq : hamilt ] ) is defined as the self - adjoint operator @xmath146 on @xmath147 given by : @xmath148 the quantum evolution operator for time @xmath98 which corresponds to @xmath115 is then : @xmath149 the quantization of the matrix @xmath150 can be defined as @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the parity operator .",
    "the unitary operators @xmath153 , @xmath154 yield a projective representation of sl@xmath97 ( which resembles the metaplectic representation ) . we will in most of the paper omit to indicate the @xmath1-dependence of the operators @xmath146 and @xmath155 .",
    "let @xmath156 and let @xmath157 denote the translation on classical phase space by @xmath158 .",
    "the corresponding quantum translation operator is defined by : @xmath159 these quantum translations satisfy the algebraic identity @xmath160 with @xmath161 , so they generate an ( irreducible ) unitary representation of the heisenberg group . for any matrix @xmath162 ,",
    "one trivially has @xmath163 .",
    "this intertwining persists at the quantum level : @xmath164",
    "consider the torus @xmath165 as a symplectic manifold with the two - form @xmath166 .",
    "then any @xmath2 sl@xmath3 defines a ( discrete ) symplectic dynamics on @xmath4 in the obvious way .",
    "we are interested in the case where @xmath14 is hyperbolic : the corresponding dynamical system is then an anosov system @xcite .",
    "the stable and unstable manifolds of any point @xmath167 are obtained by wrapping the lines with slopes @xmath168 passing through @xmath169 around the torus .",
    "we present here some properties of these manifolds that we will need in subsequent sections .",
    "a simple example we will use for numerical illustrations is the so called `` arnold s cat map '' @xcite @xmath170 its lyapounov coefficient is @xmath171 .",
    "the stable and unstable manifolds of the fixed point @xmath172 are depicted in figure  [ f : varietes ] .    for any hyperbolic matrix @xmath14 , the slopes @xmath173 and @xmath174 of the unstable and stable directions are quadratic irrationals ( _ i.e. _ the solutions of a quadratic equation with integer coefficients ) .",
    "it is well known @xcite that any quadratic irrational @xmath175 satisfies the following diophantine inequality : @xmath176 this means that quadratic irrationals are poorly approximated by rationals , in the sense that , to get an approximation with an error @xmath177 , you need a rational with a denominator of order at least @xmath178",
    ".    this inequality will be used in the following manner .",
    "consider the eigenvectors @xmath179 of @xmath115 defined as @xmath180 , @xmath181 ( with @xmath134 the matrix defined in eq .  ) .",
    "as usual , their dual basis @xmath182 ( defined as @xmath183 , _ etc . _ ) can be used to express the coordinates of a point @xmath169 in the basis @xmath179 : @xmath184 we call d@xmath185 the distance between a point @xmath186 and @xmath187 , and we will estimate it for @xmath169 on the ( un)stable axis : @xmath188 to prove this , first note that , for any @xmath189 s.t . @xmath190 , we have @xmath191 where we have used the fact that @xmath192 is a quadratic irrational . interchanging @xmath193 and @xmath194 , we obtain a first set of inequalities :    [ lem : diophantine ] there is a constant @xmath195 ( depending on @xmath14 ) such that , for any integer lattice point @xmath196 , @xmath197    we can now prove ( [ eq : distance ] ) as follows . for each @xmath198",
    ", there exists an @xmath199 so that @xmath200 since , obviously , @xmath201 , ( [ eq : distance ] ) follows easily .    we will in addition need a slightly refined statement .",
    "if the lattice point @xmath196 is in a sufficiently thin strip around the unstable axis , it satisfies @xmath202 , which implies the lower bound @xmath203 .",
    "together with the above lemma , this entails @xmath204 for a certain @xmath205 .",
    "interchanging @xmath206 , we see that the same inequality holds for points in a sufficiently thin strip around the stable axis . outside the union of these strips ,",
    "this inequality can be violated by at most a finite set of lattice points ; therefore , upon reducing the constant @xmath205 we obtain the main technical result of this section :    there exists a constant @xmath207 ( depending on @xmath14 ) such that , for any integer points @xmath208 of the plane , their coordinates along the ( un)stable directions satisfy : @xmath209    these inequalities precisely control the sparseness of the lattice points inside a strip around the unstable axis : the narrower the strip , the farther successive lattice points have to be from each other .",
    "we recall as briefly as possible the basic setting for the quantum mechanics of a system with @xmath4 as phase space , as well as the quantization of the automorphism @xmath14 , referring to @xcite and references therein for further details . in order to define the hilbert space associated to @xmath4 , we first consider the translation operators @xmath210 , which satisfy @xmath211 as a result of ( [ e : heisenberg ] ) .",

    "let now @xmath232 , so that @xmath233 ( see eq .  ) are integers .",
    "one then easily deduces from ( [ e : m and t ] ) and ( [ e : projector ] ) that the quantum map @xmath5 satisfies :    @xmath234    the constant shift on the right hand side ( rhs ) is due to the phases @xmath235 appearing in .",
