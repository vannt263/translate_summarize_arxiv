    "<S> observation of the interplay between interacting energy levels of two spin species is limited by the difficulties in continuously tracking energy levels , and thus leaves spin transport in quantum wires still not well understood . </S>",
    "<S> we present a dc conductance feature in the non - equilibrium transport regime , a direct indication that the first one - dimensional subband is filled mostly by one spin species only . how this anomalous spin population changes with magnetic field and source - drain bias is directly measured . </S>",
    "<S> we show the source - drain bias changes spin polarisation in semiconductor nanowires , providing a fully electrical method for the creation and manipulation of spin polarization as well as spin - polarized currents .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum dynamics of spins has recently been of central interest for a possible technology of spintronics , the main challenge of which is to generate , manipulate , and detect spin - polarised currents in nanostructures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> realization of this technology principally relies on ferromagnetic contacts @xcite , but efficient spin injection as well as the manipulation of the injected spins remains a challenge for practical applications . </S>",
    "<S> other approaches such as the spin hall effect @xcite and voltage - induced changes in magnetisation @xcite have thus been proposed and have attracted considerable interest . here </S>",
    "<S> we directly demonstrate that quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) mesoscopic devices , nanowires and quantum point contacts , can form the basis of a fully electrical method for the creation and manipulation of spin polarisation as well as spin - polarised currents without high magnetic fields or ferromagnetic injecting contacts .    </S>",
    "<S> semiconductor nanowires and quantum point contacts @xcite are among the simplest mesoscopic devices and have significant applications in quantum information processing as charge sensors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> possible spontaneous spin polarisation , as manifest in the so - called 0.7 anomaly @xcite , was suggested to occur in this strongly correlated quasi-1d system and continues to attract fundamental interest within the equilibrium ( ohmic ) transport regime . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a robust conductance feature at @xmath0 in the non - equilibrium transport regime was linked to a pure spin - polarised current @xcite , which is a possible candidate for efficient spin injection and detection .    </S>",
    "<S> the study of the underlying mechanism of these puzzling conductance features in quasi-1d devices and any associated spin polarisation @xmath1 is severely limited by the difficulties in tracking the quasi-1d subbands , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the total densities in each of the two spin bands . </S>",
    "<S> electron transport is frequently studied by measuring the differential conductance @xmath4 when a small ac signal of a few microvolts is applied . </S>",
    "<S> however , the differential conductance only provides information on the transport properties at a specific value of the chemical potential , detecting the 1d energy level when it moves across a chemical potential and @xmath5 exhibits a change in value , not elsewhere , as @xmath5 remains unchanged , forming a quantised plateau . </S>",
    "<S> measurement of @xmath5 is also performed in the non - equilibrium transport regime , where a relatively large source - drain dc bias comparable to the subband energy spacings ( i.e. , a few millivolts ) is applied to split the chemical potential into two separate source ( @xmath6 ) and drain potentials ( @xmath7 ) , allowing observation of a subband crossing the source and drain chemical potentials only .    a recently developed method of analysis </S>",
    "<S> , the dc conductance of the nanowire @xmath8 , provides a means to track the subband energy level as it is continuously filled by electrons , consequently giving new insights into the conductance anomalies and electron - electron interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dc conductance  equivalent to an integration of ac conductance  of a single spinless subband is given by @xmath9 $ ] , where @xmath10 is the energy separation of @xmath6 and the bottom of the subband when the subband energy lies between two potentials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the subband filling @xmath10 can be directly tracked during the experiment by measuring @xmath11 ; it is being able to follow subband movements which gives the technique its usefulness .    </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the dc conductance is the integral of information given by the ac conductances over the range of @xmath12 , which measures the subband filling energy . </S>",
    "<S> such energy - related information can not be seen in the traces of @xmath5 . in the non - equilibrium regime </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 indicates filling energy and behaves very differently from its corresponding @xmath5 , whereas in the equilibrium regime ( as @xmath13 ) there is little difference between them .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we describe dc conductance measurements in the non - equilibrium transport region , and present a dc conductance anomaly belonging to the 0.7 family . </S>",
    "<S> this @xmath11 anomaly directly demonstrates an unusual spin population behaviour of the quasi-1d subbands , viz . </S>",
    "<S> , the minority spin - up subband almost stops being filled as carrier density increases with split - gate voltage @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour was previously suggested @xcite , but has not yet been directly observed . </S>",
    "<S> how it changes with source - drain bias in the non - equilibrium regime is even much less understood . </S>",
    "<S> we now demonstrate how this anomalous subband filling changes as a function of magnetic field and source - drain bias , and provide insight into the puzzling conductance anomaly at @xmath15 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show that the source - drain bias changes the spin polarisation of electrons moving through the quasi-1d devices . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - polarised state in the non - equilibrium region is more robust than that in the equilibrium region , and is thus more practical for spintronics . </S>",

    "<S> we therefore conclude that the first 1d subband is spin - split even at @xmath21 in the @xmath24 plateau region , where the spin - up subband lies _ between _ @xmath6 and @xmath7 , together with the spin - down subband below @xmath7 .    because measurements of @xmath11 as a function of @xmath14 indicate how electrons between @xmath6 and @xmath7 continuously populate the subband as the 1d channel widens with split - gate voltage , @xmath11 forms a plateau only after the subband moves below both chemical potentials , very different from @xmath5 which forms a plateau whenever the subband energy level is not near a chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> the grayscale plots of @xmath39 [ figure  [ fig3](c ) and ( d ) ] clearly show that , as expected , @xmath11 plateaux occur when there are no 1d subbands lying between two chemical potentials , such as the regions in which the corresponding @xmath5 exhibits the @xmath40 and the @xmath41 plateau . </S>",
    "<S> no plateau is expected in @xmath11 whenever a subband lies between @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( i.e. , the region between a pair of v - shaped @xmath36 branches ) even though the corresponding @xmath5 does exhibit a plateau , for example , the regions of the @xmath0 , the @xmath42 , and the @xmath43 plateau in figure  [ fig3](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is , however , an exception for the region where the @xmath44 plateau is found : a dc conductance plateau occurs when the first spin - up subband still lies between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , implying an unusual population behaviour of this subband .    </S>",
    "<S> the 0.7-like dc conductance anomaly in the non - equilibrium regime is a direct indication that the first spin - up subband almost stops populating as the carrier density increases with split - gate voltage , since the value of the dc conductance is equivalent to the subband filling @xmath10 . in other words , a plateau or shoulder - like feature in @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> as a function of @xmath14 indicates a slower rate at which electrons fill the subband when it is between @xmath6 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the 0.7 structure itself is caused by a similar behaviour of a spin - up subband as @xmath13 , in agreement with the theoretical prediction @xcite and the phenomenological models @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the densities of the two spin types as well as the spin polarisation can be obtained provided that the filling energies @xmath10 in each of the two spin subbands are measured .    , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath45 , as a function of ( i ) magnetic field at @xmath17mv ( black symbols at the bottom ) , obtained from figure  [ pin402](a ) , and ( ii ) source - drain bias @xmath12 at @xmath32 t ( red symbols at the top ) , obtained from figure  [ pin403](b ) . ]    the conductance value of the @xmath11 anomaly decreases with increasing magnetic field [ figure  [ pin402](a ) ] on the one hand , and increases with increasing source - drain bias [ figure  [ pin403](b ) ] on the other . </S>",
    "<S> this can be further investigated by calculating @xmath10 from the value of @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ pin405 ] shows the energy difference between the edge of the first spin - up subband and @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath46 , as a function of ( i ) magnetic field at @xmath17  mv ( black symbols at the bottom ) , and ( ii ) source - drain bias @xmath12 at @xmath32  t ( red symbols at the top ) . </S>",
    "<S> the points are obtained from the dc conductance value of the anomalous @xmath11 plateau , indicating the energy of the first spin - up level with respect to @xmath7 as it stops populating . </S>",
    "<S> this energy gap increases linearly with @xmath47 and follows the relation @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are two fitting parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the linear - least - square fit gives @xmath51  mev and @xmath52 . the parameter @xmath49 is the energy gap at @xmath21 , and @xmath50 is quite close to the effective _ g_-factor of bulk gaas , @xmath53 , for the zeeman splitting . </S>",
    "<S> the consistency between them implies that the spin - up subband stops populating further , for a range of gate voltages , just when the first spin - down channel with its energy level near @xmath7 is open to electrons moving from the drain . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to stress that the nonzero @xmath49 is equal to the spin gap at @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> the bias dependence of the energy gap at the top of figure  [ pin405 ] suggests the same physics . </S>",
    "<S> the energy gap , @xmath54 , varying from @xmath55 to @xmath56  mev for source - drain biases between @xmath57  mv and @xmath58  mv at @xmath32  t , is close to the spin - split energy gap , @xmath59  mev , which is obtained using source - drain bias spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> note that the energy gap slightly increases with increasing @xmath12 , indicating that it is caused by a combination of coulomb and exchange interactions . </S>",
    "<S> there are proposals that this is expected to widen with increasing carrier density @xcite and in our case this corresponds to increasing @xmath12 in the @xmath24 plateau region .    in the @xmath24 plateau region a @xmath5 conductance value of @xmath60 is expected rather than the obtained @xmath24 , although the measured @xmath5 is in general between @xmath34 and @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested that this anomalous differential conductance value is due to the spin - up subband level being close to @xmath7 and consequently filled in part @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , here we have directly measured the subband energy via the dc conductance and found that the subband edge is in fact far above @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath24 plateau behaves in a very different manner from the 0.7 structure , in that it barely changes with temperature up to @xmath62  k , which indicates that it is not significantly affected by thermal broadening and so the 1d subband edges are not close to the chemical potentials .    </S>",
    "<S> a nonlinear electron filling of the spin - up subband as a function of @xmath12 could be responsible for the enhancement of differential conductance of the `` 0.85 plateau '' . in a non - interacting model for establishing unidirectional dynamics @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the 1d energy level moves linearly with increasing @xmath12 , resulting in a quantised @xmath5 of @xmath0 for a spinless 1d mode . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , any extra population of electrons , caused by the 1d energy level moving downward instead of being fixed with respect to @xmath63 as @xmath12 is increased , will enhance the differential conductance . </S>",
    "<S> this model is consistent with the spin population behaviour observed via the dc conductance anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the 0.85 plateau is observed at @xmath64 in ingaas @xcite , implying the significance of the interaction effect in these two systems is different .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , an anomalous dc conductance feature has been directly related to a non - equilibrium spin population behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> this also gives rise to the corresponding differential conductance finite - bias feature at around @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated this dc conductance anomaly and have shown how the population of the minority up - spins and the spontaneous spin polarisation changes as a function of magnetic field and source - drain bias . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a key to a more complete understanding of coulomb and exchange interactions and the 0.7 anomaly in quasi - one - dimensional systems , as well as a fully electrical method for creation and manipulation of spin - polarised currents . </S>"
