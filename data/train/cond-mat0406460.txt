    "the stripe phenomenon is one of many interesting and novel properties observed in high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductors .",
    "static stripes were first experimentally found in @xmath1 @xcite by neutron scattering , where narrow elastic magnetic superlattice peaks located at @xmath2 and charge - order peaks at @xmath3 are clearly identified at doping concentration @xmath4 .",
    "this result is interpreted as that the dopant - induced holes collect in domain walls that separate antiferromagnetic ( af ) antiphase domains .",
    "this picture is also supported by the x - ray diffraction experiments@xcite . in @xmath5 compounds",
    ", people have also tried to use dynamical stripes to explain the observation by the inelastic neutron scattering @xcite , where narrow magnetic peaks at the af wave vectors , @xmath6 and @xmath7 with @xmath8 at low energies were found .",
    "somewhat similar incommensurate dynamic magnetic fluctuations were also reported @xcite in ybco compounds .",
    "nuclear quadruple resonance(nqr)@xcite , muon spin resonance@xcite , and magnetic susceptibility measurements@xcite all verify the evidence of stripe in @xmath5 .",
    "stripes have also been observed in the oxygen - doped @xmath9 using nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) techniques@xcite .",
    "these experimental results suggest that the _ stripe instability _ may be extensively present in the cuprates as a competing order , which contributes to the complexity of the phase diagram .",
    "the existence of the stripes in a strongly correlated electron system was actually first predicted @xcite by zaanen and gunnarsson _ before _ the experimental discovery .",
    "they found the stripe mean - field solution in a two - band hubbard model , in which holes doped into the parent antiferromagnet generally tend to arrange themselves into straight lines aligned parallel to each other , _ i.e , _ the charged stripes . since the experimental discovery of the static stripes in the cuprates , theoretical investigations of the stripe and stripe - related physics",
    "have been conducted very intensively in the high-@xmath10 field .",
    "numerical studies of the t - j model by the dmrg present conflicting conclusions as to the existence of stripe phases in its ground state , which might be caused by the strong finite - size effects@xcite .",
    "recent theoretical developments in the stripe physics have been reviewed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "so far the most of theoretical studies on the origin of the stripes in the cuprates are either based on phenomenological theories or focused on the static ones at the mean - field level . to truly understand the microscopic origin of the stripe phase and its competitive relation with the homogeneous phases ( including superconductivity ) , one needs to know when a stripe can be melt and be broken into pieces , namely , _  _ what it is made of , and when it can become stable against various kinds of fluctuational effects .",
    "recently , it has been shown @xcite that there exists a _",
    "more _ stable elementary object , known as a hole dipole , in the low - doping spin ordered phase described by the t - j model .",
    "such a charge @xmath11 entity can be regarded as a dipole composed of a charged vortex ( centered at a spinless holon ) and a neutral antivortex which is self - trapped in real space .",
    "due to the so - called phase string effect , an infinite ( logarithmic divergent ) energy is needed if one is to destroysuch a composite by separating two poles of the dipole infinitely far away .    on the other hand , since each hole dipole is self - trapped in real space , its kinetic energy is suppressed .",
    "thus the potential energy ( from impurities , for instance ) and the dipole - dipole interaction between two holes will become dominant . in the absence of disorder or impurities and without considering the long - range coulomb repulsion ,",
    "an inhomogeneous instability has been found in such a system and in particular various stripe instabilities were suggested @xcite to occur . in other words , if a stripe does form in this system , hole - dipoles described above will become the elementary building blocks .",
    "consequently the fluctuations and dynamics of stripes as well as the melting of them may be understood and mathematically described from a new angle based on the hole - dipoles .    in this paper , we shall follow up the stripe instability pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite and demonstrate mathematically how a _",
    "stable _ stripe can grow from individual hole - dipoles by starting with only a few of them .",
    "we find that these finite number of hole - dipoles generally form a regular polygon with a minimized potential energy , which is stable against the perturbations . with the increase of the hole number",
    ", the polygon eventually evolves into a stripe and then stripes as the hole concentration becomes finite in the thermodynamic limit , which result in the stripe phase .",
    "we further consider the zn impurity effects on both hole dipoles and stripes and predict that stripes can be easily destroyed in the presence of random zincs .",
    "we start with the two - dimensional t - j model . at half - filling ,",
    "it turns into the heisenberg model with a good description of the magnetic properties in the cuprates .",
    "the marshall sign rule is found @xcite in the ground state of such a model , where the flips of two antiparallel spins at opposite sublattice sites are always accompanied by a sign change in the ground - state wave function : @xmath12 . upon doping , however , this marshall sign rule will get frustrated by the motion of the doped holes .",
    "when a hole hops from site to site , a sequence of @xmath13 signs will be left behind which can not be repaired by spin - flip processes and is called phase - string @xcite .",
    "the phase - string theory is developed to accurately handle the phase - string effect in the t - j model .",
    "this theory is based on a new kind of slave - particle formula in which electron operator reads @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a bosonic holon  creation operator and @xmath16 is a bosonic spinon  annihilation operator , satisfying the following no double occupancy constraint @xmath17 here the nonlocal phase factor @xmath18 precisely keeps the track of the singular part of the phase string effect as well as the fermionic statistics of the electron operator@xmath19 as defined by @xmath20 } , \\ ] ] with @xmath21 and @xmath22    the effective phase - string model of the t - j hamiltonian is given by @xmath23 -j_{s}\\sum_{\\langle ij\\rangle \\sigma } \\left [ \\left ( e^{i\\sigma a_{ij}^{h}}\\right ) b_{i\\sigma } ^{\\dagger } b_{j-\\sigma } ^{\\dagger } + h.c.\\right ] ,   \\label{heff}\\ ] ] with @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "the most important and unique structure of the phase - string theory is a mutual dual relation in ( [ heff ] ) : for holons , a spinon simply behaves like a @xmath26 flux - tube and for spinons , a holon also behaves like a @xmath27 flux - tube , which are described by the lattice gauge fields @xmath28 and @xmath29 as follows : @xmath30 and @xmath31 for a closed path @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 denoting spinon and holon number operators , respectively .      in the phase - string theory ,",
    "the spin - flip operator is defined as @xmath35,\\ ] ] with @xmath36 in the af spin ordered phase , the spinons are bose condensed , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath37 with the spins lying in the xy plane",
    ". the polarization direction of the spin ordering is determined by @xmath38 \\label{s+^}$ ] . from this , we can see that besides the sign @xmath39 , which reflects the staggered af order , there is an additional phase @xmath40 $ ] introduced by holons , which represents a twist of the spins with respect to each holon .",
    "namely , each time when one circles around a holon once , a @xmath41 rotation is found in the direction of the spin ordering .",
    "the resulting spin configuration is called a meron ( spin vortex ) [ fig.2 of ref .",
    "a meron costs an energy which is logarithmically dependent on the size of the system . and",
    "for two holons , the induced spin twists are in the same way such that there exists a repulsive interaction between them . in order to remove such an unphysical energy divergence",
    ", an antimeron should be induced @xcite near every holon - meron to cancel out the spin twists at large distance .",
    "an antimeron is defined by : @xmath42 ,   \\label{bmeron}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 here @xmath44 denotes the coordinate of the center of an antimeron labelled by @xmath45 . as a result    @xmath46 . \\label{s+}\\ ] ]    define @xmath47 to describe the spin twist , with @xmath48 here the meron and anti - meron are centered at @xmath49 respectively . at @xmath50",
    "one obtains a dipolar twist @xmath51 the energy cost of such a dipole configuration is given as the following @xcite    @xmath52    which is finite .",
    "in the above , @xmath53 ( @xmath54 is the lattice constant ) . this meron - antimeron spin configuration is called a hole - dipole @xcite .",
    "the displacement connecting the centers of a meron and an antimeron can be defined as the dipole moment here .",
    "the dipole moment is determined by the two dimensional coulomb gas theory by a standard kt  renormalization group ( rg ) method@xcite .",
    "near half filling @xmath55 we estimate the centers of a meron and an antimeron as the lattice constant @xmath56 .    at the end of this part , we note that in somewhat different contexts , the concept of hole dipoles has been also suggested by different authors through different approaches .",
    "it is raised in references@xcite that the doped holes introduce a local ferromagnetic exchange coupling between their neighboring @xmath57 , which brings frustration to the background antiferromagnetism .",
    "the frustrating bond acts like a magnetic dipole . from this picture , they studied the suppression of antiferromagnetic correlations by the hole - dipoles , and the magnetic phase diagram was obtained .",
    "it is also pointed out in reference@xcite that the doped holes in the form of hole - spin - polaron interact with each other through dipolar potential .",
    "it is just the excitation of these spin - polarons that forms the stripe@xcite . in reference@xcite",
    ", an analogy was given between the doped holes in the af background with the @xmath58 impurity in the liquid @xmath59 .",
    "as a result , it is also found that the mobile - hole creates a long - range dipolar spin - backflow . and in reference@xcite , the interaction between the holes is more carefully considered , including the long - rang coulomb interaction , the dipolar potential , and the short - range attraction .",
    "the competing of these interactions leads to the complicated phase diagram , which includes the diagonal stripe .",
    "a hole - dipole is self - localized @xcite in space with the suppression of its kinetic energy .",
    "if there is an impurity , such a hole - dipole can be easily trapped around , whose effect will be discussed in sec .",
    "iv . in this section",
    ", we shall consider the impurity - free case , in which the hole dipole can be located anywhere in real space due to the translational symmetry .",
    "for multi - number hole - dipoles , the dipole - dipole interaction will determine the spatial configuration of them . in the following we start with the case of two hole - dipoles first .      for two dipoles well separated from each other ,",

    "it is easy to see that the condition to minimize their potential energy at a fixed distance is @xmath67 which results in an attractive potential energy , @xmath68 two dipoles will then move closer and closer until reach a least distance @xmath69 , determined essentially by the size of the dipoles .",
    "when the distance between two dipoles are near @xmath70 , the potential described by ( [ vdd ] ) usually is no longer correct .",
    "however , we shall use the formula ( [ vdd ] ) approximately at @xmath71 and take the positions of the dipoles as continuous variables by ignoring the discrete lattice sites in the following considerations of @xmath72-dipole case . _",
    "then the problem is reduced to a mathematical one to search for the optimum configuration for the @xmath72-dipoles which interact with each other through ( [ vdd ] ) , under the constraint that the distance between any two dipoles should be no less than twice of the average dipole moment @xmath73 . _         and the angles between their moments and the line connecting their centers to be @xmath74",
    ", the track of the center of dipole 3 to optimize the direction of its moment is a circle which passes the former two dipoles , centering at @xmath75 , with the radius @xmath76 .",
    "the directions of the three dipoles are along the tangent of the circle ]          now let us consider three dipoles case .",
    "in fig.2 , three hole - dipoles are marked by 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "suppose the first and second dipoles are located at @xmath77 , with the angles between their dipole moments and the line connecting them to be @xmath78 .",
    "then we want to find out what is the optimal location for the third dipole . from fig .",
    "2 , it is easy to see that for the dipoles marked by 1 and 3 , one has @xmath79 and for 2 and 3 , one has @xmath80 then one finds @xmath81 defining the coordinate of the third dipole by @xmath82 , we get @xmath83 and thus @xmath84   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{-2hy}{x^2+y^2-h^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such that @xmath85 > from ( [ 22 ] ) , we can see that the track of @xmath82 is just a circle passing through dipole 1 and 2 , centered at @xmath86 with a radius @xmath87 . from the knowledge of geometry , it is easy to see that the moments of these three dipoles will all point along the tangents of the circle , as shown in fig .",
    "then the energy - minimal configuration for three hole - dipoles is obtained as an equilateral triangle .",
    "the minimal interaction energy for three hole - dipoles is @xmath88 with @xmath89 and @xmath90 is radius of the circle crossing three dipoles .",
    "when the fourth hole - dipole is added , it should first make up an optimal configuration with the dipole 1 and 2 , and thus is located on a circle as discussed above .",
    "then by further making up an optimal configuration with the dipole 1 and 3 , it will also be located on an another circle passing through the dipole 1 and 3 .",
    "since the dipole 3 is already on a circle determined by 1 and 2 , with its dipole moment along the tangent , the circle determined by the dipole 1 and 3 is the same as that determined by the dipole 1 and 2 , and so is the one determined by dipole 2 and 3 .",
    "the same argument is applicable to @xmath72 dipoles .",
    "so the optimal configuration for @xmath72 dipoles under the potential ( [ vdd ] ) will be always on a circle , with each dipole moment  along the tangent of the circle and the proportional spacing for each dipole .",
    "such configuration is just a regular polygon with @xmath72 edges .",
    "to low energy the radius of the circle @xmath90 will shrink until the length of every edge is equal to the minimum @xmath91 , @xmath92 the minimal interaction energy for @xmath72 hole - dipoles ( @xmath72 is a odd number ) is @xmath93 with @xmath94 if @xmath72 is even number , the minimal interaction energy is @xmath95.\\ ] ]    numerical simulations for up to @xmath96 dipoles also show that for these interacting dipoles , the optimized configurations with minimized total energy are always regular polygons as discussed above .",

    "is displayed .",
    "each dipole has a perturbation in the position and direction @xmath97 .",
    "the dipole 0 and dipole 1 are fixed at the origin point and on the x axis respectively , as the total potential has global @xmath98 invariance . ]      in this part we will show the stability of the regular polygon configuration for hole - dipoles . for a regular polygon configuration , the distance between two nearest dipoles has reached the minimal @xmath91 .",
    "but the distances between other pairs of dipoles have not arrived at their minimum .",
    "mathematically , it should be proved that the configuration is stable against perturbations .",
    "first we change the direction of a dipole moment from it s original direction @xmath99 to @xmath100 the change of the total energy for @xmath72 hole - dipoles ( @xmath72 is a odd number ) is @xmath101   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\simeq & ( q^2\\sum_k\\frac{r_0 ^ 2}{\\left| { \\bf r}_k\\right| ^2})(\\delta \\varphi ) ^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath102 defined by ( [ r_k ] ) . on the other hand , if @xmath72 is even number , the energy difference is @xmath103(\\delta \\varphi ) ^2>0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    when more hole - dipoles change the directions of their moments simultaneously , the energy cost is simply the sum of all the positive energy cost by every change .",
    "so the regular polygon configuration is stable against changing the directions of the dipole moments @xmath104 .      next we change the positions of the centers of the dipoles . in fig.7 , the case of @xmath105",
    "is shown as an example .",
    "the position and direction of each dipole are marked in fig.7 .",
    "here @xmath91 is set to be 1 for convenience .",
    "the dipole 0 and dipole 1 are fixed at the origin point and on the x axis respectively .",
    "each dipole has a perturbation in the position and direction @xmath106 .",
    "after this perturbation , we can expand the potential up to first order .",
    "taking dipole 1 and dipole 2 as an example , we have    @xmath107    among which    @xmath108    for the numerator , we have @xmath109    in the above equation , @xmath110 and @xmath111 denotes the changes in the directions of the moments of dipole 1 and dipole 2 , while @xmath112 denotes the change in the direction of line connecting dipole 1 and dipole 2 , @xmath113 thus the change in the numerator is zero to the first order of the perturbation . for the denominator , we have @xmath114    as a result , up to the first order perturbation , the potential becomes : @xmath115    in the same way , we expanded the potential among other dipoles , and obtained the following expansion of the total potential up to the first order perturbation , @xmath116    to satisfy the constraint that the distances between the centers of any two dipoles should be no less than @xmath117 , we expanded the formula of their distances to the first order perturbation and have : @xmath118    > from ( [ dv ] ) and ( [ constraint ] ) , we obtained that : @xmath119 which denotes that the change of the total potential is no less than zero up to the first order perturbation .",
    "our above demonstration can be easily generalized to arbitrary @xmath72 .",
    "for a general @xmath72 , we have @xmath120 up to the first order perturbation , we have : @xmath121 the constraint for the least distance between any two adjacent dipoles reads : @xmath122    it can be checked that @xmath123 in which @xmath124/[\\sin(\\pi i)/n]^3}{% 8\\sin(\\pi / n)\\sin(2\\pi /n)}>0 .",
    "\\label{g}\\ ] ]    > from ( [ dr ] ) , ( [ dvt ] ) and ( [ g ] ) , we have @xmath125 > from ( [ dvn ] ) , we know that the change of the total potential is no less than zero up to the first order perturbation for arbitrary @xmath72 . when all the @xmath126 and @xmath127 are carefully chosen so that the `` = '' is realized in ( [ dr ] ) , ( [ dvn ] ) turns into @xmath128 in such cases , we should have to check the second order perturbation in the potential energy as the first order perturbation is zero .",
    "we again gave our proof for @xmath105 as an example .",
    "when @xmath129 , and @xmath130 , the `` = '' is realized in ( [ constraint ] ) and hence ( [ dv4 ] ) .",
    "the first order perturbation of the total potential is zero , so we expanded it to the second order perturbation , and obtained @xmath131 and therefore , @xmath132 so the change in the total potential is also no less than zero up to the second order perturbation .    in the case of @xmath133",
    ", we can carry out similar expansion , and draw the same conclusion .    by the above perturbative expansion",
    ", we proved that the configuration shown in fig .",
    "6 is stable against local perturbation in the positions and directions of the dipole moments .",
    "in the above part , we have proved that @xmath72 dipoles will arrange themselves to form a regular polygon to minimize the energy . and",
    "the radius of the circle @xmath90 will shrink until the length of every edge is equal to the minimum @xmath91 .",
    "when @xmath134 , the radius of the circle @xmath90 turn to diverge @xmath135 and a regular polygon will naturally be stretched into a line ( _ i.e. , _ a stripe ) , as shown in fig .",
    "the minimal interaction energy for a regular polygon with large number of hole - dipoles is about @xmath136 when a dipole leaves away from the line ( a stripe ) , finite energy @xmath137 will be cost @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "thus the line shape configuration - stripe is stable against local perturbation .",
    "it is easy to see that such a `` stripe ''  of charge carriers is embedded in a domain wall of the af background . to see this , we consider a stripe along the @xmath141-axis composed of the hole - dipoles of a size @xmath142 and spaced by @xmath143 . far away from the @xmath141-axis , the total spin twist summed from ( [ dipole ] )",
    "is given by @xmath144 when @xmath145 here @xmath146 and @xmath147 according to the definition .",
    "thus a phase shift is found across the stripe with @xmath148    for a special case , @xmath149 , the line becomes an antiphase domain wall @xmath150 namely , a stripe composed of hole - dipoles is topologically an antiphase domain wall .",
    "> from ( [ deltaphi ] ) , we can also understand physically the reason why the holes tend to arrange themselves into a straight line . when the hole - dipoles are distributed randomly in the af background , each dipole induces a spin twist as described by ( [ dipole ] ) , which costs additional energy .",
    "but when the hole - dipoles form a stripe , the total twist spins away from the domain wall will be cancelled out such that the spin ordering on either side of the domain wall becomes unfrustrated , just like at half - filling .",
    "yet there is a further advantage in the formation of the stripe , _",
    "i.e , _ the kinetic energy of the holes can be gained . recall that an isolated hole - dipole can not move freely as it is self - trapped in real space .",
    "but when the hole - dipoles arrange themselves into a straight line , the individual holes actually may move freely along the stripe such that a delocalization energy can be gained .",
    "this will correspond to a metallic stripe case .    with a further increase of doping",
    ", more stripes will be formed as shown in fig .",
    "9 . for any two adjacent stripes , without the spin frustration inside the domain between them , they will not gain additional energy by being closer . under a long - range coulomb repulsion ,",
    "a uniform stripe phase will be stable against a cluster formation . in this uniform stripe phase ,",
    "the distances between two neighboring stripes are the same , which obviously is determined by the hole concentration .",
    "it should be noticed that the recently found `` checkerboard '' pattern in the ldos by the stm in the cuprate may display a new kind of cdw order@xcite .",
    "its possibility in the framework of the above mentioned dipole picture is under further exploration when the long - range coulomb repulsion is considered more carefully .",
    ", the regular polygon shown in fig.6 turns into a line .",
    "the distance between the centers of neighboring dipoles is @xmath117 . ]",
    "as emphasized before , the stripe formation is intimately related to the self - localization of individual hole - dipoles .",
    "we also have mentioned that disorder or impurities in the system may have an amplified  effect on localization .    in the following we discuss the effect of zn impurities on hole - dipoles as well as the stripe phase .",
    "it is well known that doped zn atoms will be present in the form of @xmath151 with a closed - shell structure , substituting the @xmath57 sites in the @xmath152 planes of the cuprates . in the t - j model ,",
    "the site occupied by the @xmath153 may be imposed by a boundary condition of an empty  site where no electron or hole can stay there at low energy .",
    "let us examine how a @xmath154 impurity and a hole - dipole will interact",
    ". inside a hole - dipole , those spins on a loop circling the center of the antimeron will have a @xmath41 rotation in their polarization directions . as the radius of",
    "such a loop shrinks continuously to the antimeron core , the spin polarization directions will change quickly and becomes uncertain at the core site .",
    "so a spin at the core site of the antimeron will just like a `` defect '' spin @xcite , and the bonds which connect the core spin with its surrounding spins can be thus viewed to be  effectively cut off , resulting an energy increase roughly @xmath155 ( @xmath156 denotes the average superexchange energy for one bond ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when a @xmath151 is doped and replaces a normal @xmath57 site , the bonds which used to connect such a @xmath57 with its surroundings are cut off with an energy cost approximately @xmath155 .",
    "but , if such a @xmath151 is to replace the @xmath157 sitting at the core of the antimeron of a hole - dipole , no additional superexchange energy will be cost by breaking up those four bonds connected to the impurity site",
    ". therefore , it will be energetically favorable for a hole - dipole to be trapped by a @xmath154 impurity . as shown in fig.10",
    ", a zn impurity locates at the center of the antimeron . experimentally , there is evidence @xcite that doped holes are indeed trapped by the zn impurities .",
    "are doped into the af background simultaneously , they would like to attract each other and form a @xmath158-holon dipole .",
    "h denotes the holon , while zn denotes the @xmath158 ]    .",
    "the stripe has to pass the @xmath158 , and so is pinned . ]",
    "according to the above discussions , a large number of zn impurities will not favor the stripe formation , for they tend to trap hole - dipoles around themselves .",
    "the random distribution of the zn leads to the random distribution of the hole - dipoles .",
    "if the zn concentration is very low , then a stripe is expected to be easily pinned by a zn , and be bent in order to pass several zincs , as shown in fig.11 . from the transport measurements@xcite and also from the muon - spin- relaxation ( @xmath160sr ) measurements@xcite , it is found that a small amount of zn impurities are effective for the pinning .",
    "so we predict that zn impurities are very effective in destroying a stripe phase at low doping .",
    "in this paper , it is shown that in the framework of the phase - string model , each hole doped into a spin ordered phase at low doping will act as a dipole which is self - trapped in real space . with the suppression of the kinetic energy ,",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction between hole - dipoles will dominate the low - energy physics in the absence of disorder or impurities .",
    "we demonstrated in detail how a few hole - dipoles collapse into a stable configuration of the regular polygon , which turns into a stripe ( stripes ) in thermodynamic limit .",
    "consequently , we found that at a finite concentration of holes at low doping , a uniform stripe phase is highly competitive .",
    "the effects of impurities are also discussed .",
    "when a @xmath151 is doped into the system , it generally tends to trap a hole around itself to form a @xmath161-holon dipole . as a result",
    ", the stripe will be pinned near the @xmath162 site .",
    "further more , we predicted that a finite concentration of zincs can easily kill a uniform stripe phase .",

    "<S> we analyze the hole - dipole configurations with lowest energy under a dipole - dipole interaction and show that these holes tend to arrange themselves into a regular polygon . </S>",
    "<S> such a stable polygon configuration will turn into a stripe as the number hole - dipoles becomes thermodynamically large and eventually a uniform stripe state can be formed , which constitutes an energetically competitive phase at low doping . </S>",
    "<S> we also briefly discuss the effect of zn impurities on individual hole - dipoles and stripes . </S>"
