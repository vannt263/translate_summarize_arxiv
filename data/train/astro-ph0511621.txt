    "the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is expected to contain most of the baryonic matter in the universe , a tenuous filamentary `` web '' of gas bridging the gaps between collapsed objects such as galaxies and clusters . at high redshifts ( @xmath1 )",
    "this web appears in quasar spectra as a multitude of lyman alpha forest absorption lines . in the nearby universe , on the other hand , hydrodynamic simulations show that most of the igm has been shock  heated to a warm  hot ( whim ) phase with temperatures of @xmath2k @xcite . at these temperatures",
    "scant neutral hydrogen remains , and the igm is thus best detected through absorption lines from highly ionized metals @xcite , particularly ovi , ovii , and oviii .",
    "recent _ chandra _  observations have indeed confirmed that this low ",
    "redshift whim exists and comprises a baryon content consistent with expectations ( nicastro et al .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "just as other galaxies are expected to form in the densest `` knots '' of the cosmic web , we also expect to see whim adjacent to , perhaps surrounding , our own milky way .",
    "indeed , x - ray spectra of several quasars show likely @xmath0 ovii  absorption .",
    "the upper limit on the ovii   emission toward mrk 421 found by @xcite indicates that this absorption system probably has an extremely low density and is thus likely to be extragalactic .",
    "additionally , other nearby low and high  ionization components may be associated with either the whim itself or may represent gas from the whim that has cooled and is now in the process of accreting onto the galaxy ; for example , the high  velocity ovi  absorption seen with _ fuse _  along many quasar lines of sight @xcite and neutral hydrogen high ",
    "velocity clouds ( hi  hvcs ) .",
    "the origin of the local ovii  absorption , and in particular its relation to the observed ovi , is still to a large degree unknown .",
    "there is some evidence that these ions could originate in a warm  hot galactic corona : for example , likely ovii  absorption has been detected within 50 kpc of the galaxy by @xcite . the observed deflection and stripping of the magellanic clouds also lends credence to the existence of a low  density corona .",
    "lower  ionization absorption , such as that from siiv and civ , is also seen at the same velocities as some ovi  hvcs , indicating that these ovi  clouds , at least , may have lower temperatures and higher densities than expected from the whim .    however , there are also reasons to believe this absorption is tracing extended whim gas .",
    "high column densities of ovi , ovii , and oviii   from the local igm are predicted by simulations to lie in certain directions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the mean velocity vector of the ovi  hvcs is highest in the local standard of rest and lowest in the local group rest frame , indicating that their origin could indeed be extragalactic @xcite .",
    "the presence of ovii  between the galaxy and large magellanic cloud does not rule out an extragalactic origin for the absorption in some directions since neither the galactic absorption or whim is necessarily homogeneous ; additionally , the whim is known to be homogeneous and consist of a variety of temperature and density phases , so some lower  ionization lines may be expected as well .",
    "thus , the questions  how are the local x - ray and uv absorption components related to each other , which are of galactic origin , and which arise in the local whim? are still unanswered .",
    "the answers to these questions have profound implications for both studies of galaxy formation and cosmology .",
    "we are now undertaking a program to determine the distribution and properties of this local hot gas and its ties to lower ",
    "ionization components , with a focus on new and archival _ chandra _  and _ fuse _  data . here",
    "we present the first results of this study , an analysis of the particularly high  quality _ chandra _  and _ fuse _  spectra of the bright agn mrk  421 and mrk  279 .",
    "a full discussion of the mrk  421 _ chandra _  and fuse spectra , and the analysis thereof , can be found in @xcite ; the following is a summary of the main results .",
    "the bright @xmath3 blazar mkn  421 was observed during two exceptionally high outburst phases for 100 ks each as part of our _ chandra_ao4 observing program : one at @xmath4ergs@xmath5@xmath6 with the low energy transmission grating ( letg ) combined with the acis - s array , and another at @xmath7ergs@xmath5@xmath6 with the hrc - s array and letg .",
    "each of these observations contains @xmath8 counts per resolution element at 21.6 .",
    "additionally , another short observation of mkn  421 was taken with hrc / letg ( 29 may 2004 ) , providing another 170 counts per resolution element .",
    "these three spectra were combined over the 1060  range to improve the signal  to  noise ratio ( s / n@xmath9 at 21  with 0.0125  binning ) .",
    "the final coadded spectrum of mkn  421 is one of the best ever taken with _",
    "chandra _ : it contains over @xmath10 total counts with @xmath11 counts per resolution element at 21.6 , providing a @xmath12 detection threshold of @xmath13m(@xmath14 for an unsaturated line ) .    using the ciao fitting package sherpa we initially modeled the continuum of mkn  421 as a simple power law with galactic foreground absorption , excluding the 4857  hrc chip gap region .",
    "metal abundances for the galactic gas were then artificially adjusted to provide a better fit around the and k  edges near 23  and 43respectively .",
    "this is _ not _ intended to represent actual changes to the absorber composition , but rather to correct uncertainties in the instrument calibration .",
    "after this fit there were still some systematic uncertainties in the best ",
    "fit continuum model ; these were corrected with broad ( @xmath15 ) gaussian emission and absorption components until the modeled continuum appeared to match the data upon inspection .",
    "indeed , the residuals of the spectrum to the final continuum model have a nearly gaussian distribution , with a negative tail indicating the presence of narrow absorption lines ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 8) .",
    "we searched for narrow , unresolved ( fwhm@xmath16 ) absorption lines at known c ,",
    "n , o , and ne transition wavelengths and used gaussians to measure the equivalent widths ( or upper limits thereupon ) for all lines found .",
    "all in all , equivalent widths for 9 significantly detected absorption lines were measured ( including ovii  k@xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ) and 4 upper limits calculated .",
    "mrk  421 was also observed for a total of 84.6ks with fuse , providing a signal  to  noise ratio of 17 near the ovi  wavelength once all spectra are combined and binned to @xmath20kms@xmath5 .",
    "this spectrum shows strong , broad ovi  absorption at @xmath21 , most likely originating in the galactic thick disk , as well as a possible ovi  hvc at @xmath22kms@xmath5  ( figure  [ fig_mkn421fuse ] ) .",
    "kms@xmath5  and a much weaker component at @xmath23kms@xmath5  ( inset).[fig_mkn421fuse ] ]      to convert the measured equivalent widths to ionic column densities , we calculated curves of growth for each absorption line over a grid of doppler parameters ( @xmath24kms@xmath5 ) and column densities ( @xmath25 ) , assuming a voigt line profile .",
    "since the x - ray lines are unresolved , @xmath26 can not be measured directly .",
    "it can , however , be inferred from the relative strengths of the three measured ovii  k  series lines .",
    "these line ratios by themselves are insufficient to determine the physical state of the ovii  absorbing medium since @xmath26 and @xmath27 are degenerate : the k@xmath17 line saturation could be due to high column density , low @xmath26 , or a combination of both . however , given an absorption line with a measured equivalent width and known oscillator strength , the inferred column density as a function of the doppler parameter can be calculated .",
    "the measured equivalent width ( and errors ) for each transition thus defines a region in the @xmath28 plane .",
    "since the actual value of @xmath27 is fixed , @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be determined by the region over which the contours `` overlap ; '' i.e. the range of doppler parameters for which the different transitions provide consistent @xmath27 measurements .    , title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    figure  [ fig_nb_mkn421 ] ( top panel ) shows such @xmath29 contours for the three measured ovii  transitions .",
    "the k@xmath17 and k@xmath18 tracks appear consistent at the @xmath30 level for @xmath31kms@xmath5 , while the overlap between the k@xmath17 and k@xmath19 tracks provides approximate 2@xmath32 limits of @xmath33kms@xmath5 .",
    "we thus assume a @xmath30 range of @xmath34kms@xmath5 .",
    "it should be noted that figure  [ fig_nb_mkn421 ] also shows some overlap between the @xmath35 and @xmath36 at @xmath37kms@xmath5 ; however , this solution is unlikely given the lower limit provided by the @xmath38 line .",
    "moreover , @xmath39kms@xmath5  implies a maximum temperature ( assuming purely thermal motion ) of @xmath40k ; such a low temperature is unlikely to produce the observed strong high  ionization lines .",
    "a similar analysis is not as effective when applied to the strong ovi@xmath41   uv doublet ( from the thick disk ) , since these lines are only slightly saturated . the ovi@xmath41  1032  line is fully resolved by _ fuse _   and relatively unblended , so its doppler parameter can be estimated much more accurately using the measured line width and strength . in an unsaturated absorption line , @xmath42 ; however , the measured fwhm increases if the line is saturated .",
    "we compensated for this by calculating voigt profile fwhms on a grid of @xmath43 and @xmath26 , and determining the region consistent with the ovi@xmath41  1032  fwhm measurement of @xmath44kms@xmath5 .    when the fwhm ",
    "derived contour is overlaid on the @xmath45 contour inferred from the equivalent width measurement of the lv ",
    "ovi  1032  line , the two regions overlap nearly orthogonally ( figure  [ fig_nb_mkn421 ] , bottom panel ) leading to a constraint of @xmath26(ovi@xmath41)@xmath46kms@xmath5 .",
    "this is more than @xmath12 higher than the doppler parameter calculated for the ovii  absorption , indicating that the ovii  and thick  disk ovi@xmath41  can not arise in the same gaseous phase .",
    "also , at no value of the doppler parameter do the 1032 , 1037 , and ovi  k@xmath17 lines all produce a consistent @xmath43 measurement ; in fact , the ovik@xmath17 column density is a factor of @xmath47 higher than that inferred from the uv data .",
    "it is thus possible that the ovi  uv transition is being suppressed , perhaps by atomic physics effects , in the absorbing medium and the @xmath48 line produces a more accurate representation of the true ovi  column density ; in the following analysis we consider both possibilities .",
    "the abundance ratios of metal ions ( for example , ovii / oviii ) are expected to vary with temperature as a result of collisional ionization ; additionally , as the density decreases to typical whim values ( @xmath49@xmath50 ) , photoionization from the extragalactic ionizing background plays an increasingly important role .",
    "we used cloudy version 90.04 @xcite to calculate relative ionic abundances for all measured elements over a grid of @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "as with the doppler parameter and column density diagnostics described above , any measured ion column density ratio then produces a `` track '' of consistency in the @xmath53 plane , and ( assuming the ions arise in the same gaseous phase ) the overlap between such `` tracks '' can place constraints on the gas temperature and density .    column density ratios between different ions of the same element ( e.g. ovi , ovii , and oviii ) produce the strongest constraints since these ratios are independent of the relative metal abundance in the gas figure  [ fig_mkn421_tne ] shows such constraints derived from these oxygen abundance ratios . if the ovi  k@xmath17 line accurately traces the ovi  column density of this medium , then the contours overlap at @xmath54@xmath50 . coupled with the total oxygen column density and assuming o / h of 0.3 times solar",
    ", this implies that the absorber has a radial extent of @xmath55mpc and a mass consistent with the expected baryonic mass of the local group .",
    "constraints on the gas temperature and density toward mrk  421 , derived from oxygen ion ratios as labeled .",
    "the dashed line indicates the upper limit on the temperature from the ovii  doppler parameter .",
    "[ fig_mkn421_tne ] ]    on the other hand , if the ovi  k@xmath17 line does _ not _ correctly measure @xmath43 , then this absorption can in principle arise in a higher  density galactic medium with @xmath56 ( as derived from the oviii / ovii  ratio with collisional ionization as the dominant process ; figure  [ fig_mkn421_tne ] ) . even in this case , a low  density ( extragalactic ) medium is fully consistent with the data .",
    "furthermore , the contour derived from the measured ne / o abundance ( not shown in the figure ) is consistent in the low ",
    "density regime if the ne / o ratio is significantly supersolar , as has been observed in other galactic and extragalactic absorption systems .",
    "a full discussion of our analysis of the mrk  279 _ chandra _  and _ fuse_spectra will appear in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "while mrk  421 was observed for relatively short periods during bright outburst phases , few other bright sources flare this dramatically .",
    "we thus searched the _",
    "chandra _",
    "archive for long  duration letg observations of relatively bright background quasars .",
    "one such source , mrk  279 ( an agn at @xmath3 ) was observed during seven periods in may 2003 for a total exposure time of 340 ks .",
    "these seven observations were coadded for a final ( unbinned ) signal  to  noise ratio of @xmath57 near 22 . as with the mrk  421 spectrum",
    ", we again used sherpa to fit a power law and foreground galactic absorption to the spectrum over @xmath58    band ( excluding the @xmath59    and @xmath60    chip gap regions ) , leaving the relative galactic metal abundances as free parameters in order to produce a better fit around the absorption edges .",
    "the remaining broad residuals were were corrected by including four broad gaussians in the source model .    .",
    "[ fig_mkn279_spec ] ]    although several strong lines such as cvi , ovii , and nvii   are apparent at the blazar redshift ( @xmath3 ) , only ovii  k@xmath17 @xmath61 is unambiguously detected at @xmath62  ( @xmath63kms@xmath5 ) with an equivalent width of @xmath64  m .",
    "upper limits are measured for the ovii  k@xmath18 and oviii  lines .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "letg wavelength scale contains intrinsic random errors of approximately @xmath65 , on the order of the statistical error on the ovii  position measurement , but these errors should not vary with time ( j.  j.  drake , private communication ) . to check the absolute wavelength scale near the ovii  line , we retrieved the nearest hrc  s / letg calibration observation of the x - ray bright star capella ( observation 3675 , taken on 2003 september 28 ) from the _ chandra _  archive and reprocessed the data in exactly the same manner as the mrk 279 data .",
    "the wavelength of the strong ovii  emission line was found to be @xmath66  or @xmath67kms@xmath5 , which is consistent with the @xmath68kms@xmath5  radial velocity of capella as listed in the simbad database .",
    "thus , any systematic effects on the measured velocity of the ovii  absorption are likely to be insignificant compared to the statistical error .",
    "mrk  279 was also observed with",
    "_ fuse _  for a total exposure time of 224  ks",
    "( though only 177  ks of these data were usable ) ; all calibrated data from these observations were retrieved and coadded in the same manner as the mrk  421 _ fuse _  data .",
    "this spectrum also shows strong galactic thick ",
    "disk ovi  absorption at @xmath69 , but unlike the mrk  421 spectrum , the high  velocity ovi  is strong and clearly separated from the thick  disk ovi  at @xmath70kms@xmath5 .",
    "figure  [ fig_mkn279_spec ] shows the ovii  and ovi  absorption systems plotted against velocity .",
    "although the error on the ovii  velocity is large , it is nonetheless significantly higher than the ovi  hvc velocity by about @xmath71 .",
    "thus , a direct association between the ovi  hvc and ovii  can be ruled out with reasonably high confidence .",
    "ovii  k@xmath17 equivalent width limits , the dashed line is from the ovii   k@xmath18 @xmath30 upper limit , and the 95% joint confidence interval is depicted by the dark hatched region .",
    "[ fig_mkn279_nhb ] ]    in the mrk  421 _ chandra _  spectrum , three absorption lines from the ovii   k - series were strongly detected .",
    "while a similar curve  of  growth analysis can be performed for mrk  279 , placing limits on @xmath27 and @xmath26 is more difficult because only the ovii  k@xmath17 line is strongly detected ; only an upper limit can be measured for the k@xmath18 line .",
    "since the absorption line properties for various column densities and doppler parameters are known , limits on these quantities can be determined using the _ chandra _  spectrum itself . for each point in the @xmath28 plane , ovii  k@xmath17 and k@xmath18 absorption lines with the calculated @xmath72 and fwhm values",
    "were added to the best ",

    "fit k@xmath18 line amplitude is zero , the unsaturated case ( assuming the ovii  line ratio constraint @xmath74 ) produces the best fit to the data .",
    "the minimum @xmath73 value was taken from such a fit , and @xmath75 calculated for every point . the 95% confidence interval ( @xmath76 ) calculated with this method",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig_mkn279_nhb ] ( as well as the @xmath28 contours derived from each transition ) ; at this confidence level all doppler parameters between @xmath77kms@xmath5  are ruled out .",
    "doppler parameters for the ovi  absorption were calculated in the same manner as for mrk  421 . in this case , however , two gaussians are necessary to fit the low  velocity ( thick  disk ) ovi .",
    "the derived velocity dispersions are @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 for the broad galactic , narrow galactic , and high  velocity ovi  components respectively ( producing the best ",
    "fit model shown in figure  [ fig_mkn279_spec ] ) .",
    "these are all strongly inconsistent with the limits found for the ovii  velocity dispersion , indicating that the ovii  is not related to any of the ovi  components .",

    "[ fig_mkn279_tne],title=\"fig : \" ]      an upper limit on the temperature of the absorbing medium of @xmath83 can be derived from the oviii / ovii  column density . since the ovii  absorption",
    "does not appear to be associated with any of the ovi  components , finding a lower limit on the temperature is more difficult .",
    "we thus assume that the ovi  absorption from the ovii  bearing gas is undetected in the _ fuse _  spectrum , and exists as a very broad ( @xmath84kms@xmath5 ) absorption line superposed on the narrower detected components .",
    "limits on the ovi  column density associated with the ovii  were thus calculated by placing such an absorption line in the _ fuse _  spectrum model , one with @xmath85kms@xmath5  and one with @xmath82kms@xmath5 , and calculating the corresponding ovi / ovii  @xmath86 constraint ( shown in figure  [ fig_mkn279_tne ] .",
    "the lower limit on temperature derived from the ovi / ovii  upper limit is highly dependent on @xmath26 ; in fact , for @xmath85kms@xmath5  the two oxygen line ratios are inconsistent with each other for _ all _ temperatures and densities .",
    "thus , if the ovii  is associated with an undetected broad ovi  line , the velocity dispersion of the absorption must be very high ( at least @xmath87kms@xmath5 ) .",
    "such a high velocity dispersion , if purely thermal , implies temperatures of @xmath88k , which is ruled out by the non  detection of oviii  absorption .",
    "this absorber must therefore be broadened primarily by nonthermal processes , perhaps due to the velocity shear of infalling hot gas associated with hvc complex c.",

    "both absorption systems appear to exhibit similar column densities and consistent temperature and density limits ( albeit with large errors ) .",
    "additionally , in both cases the detected x - ray absorption does _ not _ appear to arise in the same phase as the low or high  velocity ovi  absorption seen in the _ fuse _  spectra , indicating that the ovii  absorption likely comes from either the local whim or a heretofore  undiscovered hot galactic component .",
    "additionally , the doppler parameters of the mrk  421 and mrk  279 absorption are highly inconsistent with each other , perhaps indicating that these two systems originate from entirely different physical processes .",
