    "it was then shown that it occurs two types of population inversion , one referred to the energy states ( determined by the external electromagnetic field ) , another concerned with the spin states ( implied by the background ) .",
    "the supposed non observation of this spin oscillation ( relying on the validity of the dipole approximation ) was used to impose an upper bound on such a coefficient : @xmath288    a point that deserves some attention concerns to the validity of the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) in the cases where the lorentz - violating perturbation contains terms like sin@xmath289 or cos@xmath289 , as in eqs .",
    "( [ a2 ] , [ b2],[ab1]-[ab4 ] ) .  in this case , the perturbation term oscillates at a frequency @xmath153 equal to half the frequency of the rwa - neglected term . the question is to know if the rapidly oscillating term ( with frequency equal to @xmath290 ) may be dropped out while the perturbation term ( with frequency equal to @xmath167 ) is kept . to answer this issue , some numerical calculations were performed out of the rwa , that is , maintaining the rapidly oscillating terms together .",
    "the observed results do not differ qualitatively and appreciably from the ones previously obtained , which leads to the conclusion that rwa is still a good approximation .",
    "finally , the cases here studied in the semiclassical viewpoint can also be considered in the context of a quantized electromagnetic field in a cavity . in this case , for the @xmath85 term the results depend on the initial state of the electromagnetic field .",
    "for an initially excited atom in a coherent state with large number of photons , the term induces only a phase on the wavefunction coefficients .",
    "as it does not alter the probability amplitudes , it corroborates the results obtained at sec .",
    "iiib ( at semi - classical level ) .",
    "we are now investigating the effects due to the background for small number of photons in the cavity , such as corrections induced on the population inversion and photon statistics .",
