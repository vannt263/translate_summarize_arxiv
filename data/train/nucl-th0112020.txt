    "@xmath0he plays an important role in a variety of light - cluster reactions , especially at low energies .",
    "one such reaction is @xmath0he(d , p)@xmath3he which is of interest in primordial nucleosynthesis studies and in studies related to the abundance of elements in the universe .",
    "it is also of interest as a fusion reaction , as it generates no neutrons . at medium energies , this reaction with polarized spins has been used to constrain the deuteron d - state probability @xcite .",
    "another interesting aspect of this reaction is that the @xmath0he nucleus behaves like a neutron , because the proton pair in @xmath0he almost forms a closed shell structure and therefore @xmath0he can serve as a good substitute for a neutron target .",
    "the @xmath0he(d , p)@xmath3he reaction can be modeled as a three - body p ",
    "n@xmath0he problem which can be handled using the faddeev formalism @xcite .",
    "this presupposes a knowledge of the p@xmath0he and the n@xmath0he interactions and of the nuclear potential .",
    "the nucleon - trinucleon interaction has been the subject of several investigations in the past . despite the effort made ,",
    "the interaction is far from being understood .",
    "many questions concerning the range and shape of the potential , as well as its energy , parity- , and @xmath4-dependence .",
    "for example , in the optical model approach the shape is either pre - chosen ( woods - saxon@xcite , gaussian @xcite _ etc . _ ) or is fitted to specific scattering cross sections @xcite , or to phase shifts which are used as input to construct phase equivalent local potentials via inverse scattering methods @xcite .",
    "some experimental data on p@xmath0he elastic scattering up to @xmath5 mev were analyzed within the framework of a separable potential model , phase shifts for the p@xmath0he and n@xmath0h systems were generated @xcite .",
    "the quality of scattering data used as input and their reproducibility is another source of ambiguity for the field practitioner .",
    "extensive phase shift analyses for the nucleon - trinucleon system were performed in the 1960s and 1970s @xcite .",
    "the most recent was carried out by yoshino _",
    "_ @xcite in the @xmath6-@xmath7mev energy region . as was pointed out , in ref .",
    "@xcite , performing phase shift analyses and constructing a potential in a specific channel requires extreme care to insure that the interaction has the correct energy , parity- , and @xmath4-dependence .",
    "the mere use of cross sections is not sufficient to uniquely extract all of these dependencies .",
    "an alternative scheme is to generate the phase shifts from reliable theoretical models , such as the resonating group model ( rgm ) . within the rgm formalism , reichstein _",
    "et al._@xcite extracted the intercluster phase shifts for this system while furutani _",
    "et al._@xcite calculated the phase shifts by using the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) .",
    "their results are in good agreement with the differential cross section and the polarization data in the low energy region .",
    "although the calculated energy spectrum of the @xmath8 resonances fits equally well the experimental data@xcite , these experimental data have been replaced in the recent article by tilley _",
    "_  @xcite . finally , we mention that an optical potential approach has been employed by teshigawara _ et al._@xcite to study the n@xmath0he system within the complex scaled siegert method .    in this paper",
    ", we employ the p@xmath0he nonlocal rgm interaction @xcite and its variant version , the so - called orthogonality condition model ( ocm ) in which the pauli forbidden states ( pfs ) are removed @xcite . furthermore , to reproduce the experimental phase shifts sufficiently well and to treat the degenerate states stemming from the absence of ls forces from the rgm kernel , we have introduced phenomenological ls forces using a technique similar to that of ref .",
    "tensor forces could also be considered for the @xmath0s@xmath9-@xmath0d@xmath9 , @xmath10p@xmath9-@xmath0p@xmath9 , @xmath0p@xmath11-@xmath0f@xmath11 , and @xmath10d@xmath11-@xmath0d@xmath11 channels .",
    "however , the corresponding experimental mixing parameters were found to be negligibly small @xcite and therefore they have been omitted .    at higher energies , the absorptive part of the phase shifts could be important , in which case an imaginary part should be included in the potential .",
    "however , in a recent phase shift analysis of yoshino _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , neither the reflection parameters for the coupling effects in different particle channels nor the imaginary part of the phase shifts above the break - up threshold were found to be significant .",
    "therefore , we will not consider the construction of complex p@xmath0he potentials and concentrate instead on real potentials that fit the low energy experimental data well .    finally",
    ", we have endeavored to represent the potentials , that reproduce the phase shifts without coulomb effects , in a separable form with appropriate form factors and parameters by using the ernst - shakin - thaler ( est ) method @xcite .",
    "such potentials are useful in solving the three - body faddeev equations in momentum space .    in sec .",

    "v we present our discussions and conclusions . finally , some technical details and formulas are shifted in appendices a and b.",
    "the construction of our p@xmath0he effective potential is based on the rgm formalism , which is given in configuration space in the paper by reichstein _",
    "_ @xcite . in operator form",
    "the rgm potential is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the energy independent local and nonlocal potential , @xmath14 is the relative energy between the proton and @xmath0he while @xmath15 is the norm ( -integral ) kernel ( see appendix a for details ) .",
    "a common problem encountered in the rgm formalism is the existence of the pfs which can be removed via the ocm technique ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the ocm potential is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the kinetic energy operator between the proton and @xmath0he .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath18 is an energy independent potential .",
    "the above operator equations can be brought into a more concrete form by using the eigen - values @xmath19 and the eigen - functions @xmath20 of the norm kernel , @xmath21\\langle \\tilde{u}_j|\\ ] ] with @xmath22 and with matrix elements @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we solved eq.([eigen1 ] ) to obtain the eigen - value @xmath25 and the eigen - function @xmath20 for each state of the p@xmath0he system up to a large number @xmath26 , beyond which the eigen - functions @xmath20 become highly oscillatory .",
    "these oscillations make the numerical calculations cumbersome and unstable .",
    "the eigen - functions @xmath20 can be expressed in terms of harmonic oscillator functions @xmath27 ( see eq .",
    "( [ hofex ] ) ) .",
    "since the potential @xmath28 becomes infinite for a pfs(@xmath29 ) the corresponding wave function is removed from the eigen - functions of the schrdinger equation . for the partly pfs ( @xmath30 ) we note that the eigen - values @xmath19 converge quickly to zero as @xmath31 increases and thus for a sufficiently large number @xmath32 , @xmath33 therefore , by using @xmath34",

    "i.e. _ there are no pfs in the system . for higher partial waves ,",
    "the absolute values of @xmath25 are much less than one , and therefore @xmath45 as well .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ ocmp3 ] )",
    "is not only free from a diverging term caused by @xmath29 , but also from numerical errors due to presence of oscillator functions with higher frequencies .    each term of eq.([ocmp3 ] ) can be easily transformed into its momentum space using fourier transforms ( see appendix b ) .",
    "it is found that the on - shell parts of the ocm scattering amplitude obtained with the transformed potentials are almost the same as those of the rgm amplitude , although the off - shell parts differ .",
    "for the spin - triplet p- and d- waves and with @xmath46 the resulting phase shift differ slightly . however , the differences are small enough and do not give rise to any important effects in the parameter fitting of these triplet channels .    within the above formalism , a realistic force with an ls component has rarely been considered until now @xcite . as a consequence , the intercluster p@xmath0he potential of the mocm , eq .",
    "( [ ocmp3 ] ) , does not include an ls force either .",
    "although in the rgm formalism the nn interaction could include an ls and tensor force , this may necessitate some additional antisymmetrization procedure .",
    "however , if we adopt a proper intrinsic cluster function that includes the effects of these forces , we could include these effects in the inter - cluster potentials by means of a folding procedure . in previous work mcintyre and",
    "haeberli@xcite introduced a phenomenological ls force to reduce the degeneracy of the l - induced potentials . in the present work we use the same technique but with an extended form for the ls forces .",
    "the ls dependence in the intercluster potentials for the spin - triplet channels is introduced via @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50,and @xmath51 are parameters adjusted to fit the experimental phase shifts . for now on we shall , for simplicity , use from now on the abbreviation ocm instead of mocm .",
