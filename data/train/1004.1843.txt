    "quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum state storage @xcite are by now well - established protocols in quantum information science . in both cases",
    "the procedure amounts to mapping one quantum state onto another ( at a remote location in the case of teleportation ) , by making use of quantum correlations in the form of entanglement or interaction between systems .",
    "however , approximate transformations could also be accomplished without any use of quantum correlations , by means of classical ` measure and prepare ' ( map ) schemes .",
    "whilst in the ideal case , the entanglement resource gives quantum teleportation a clear advantage in terms of performance , there exists inevitable degradation of the quantum channel in realistic implementations .",
    "this has led to a number of investigations into the existence of optimal map schemes to locate classical - quantum boundaries and assign precise benchmarks for proving the presence of quantum effects @xcite .",
    "any experimental demonstration of quantum teleportation and state storage has to perform better than the optimal map scheme , to be certified as a truly quantum demonstration .",
    "a review of the quantum benchmarks for completely unknown pure input states of @xmath6-dimensional systems can be found in @xcite .",
    "more recent research has largely focused on benchmarks originating in the context of teleportation and quantum memory for continuous variable ( cv ) systems @xcite , with notable results obtained for transmission of pure and mixed coherent input states , and squeezed states @xcite .",
    "beautiful experiments @xcite involving light ( gaussian modes ) and matter ( coherent and spin - squeezed atomic ensembles ) have demonstrated unambiguous quantum teleportation , storage and retrieval of these infinite - dimensional quantum states with a measured ` fidelity ' between input and output exceeding the benchmark set by the optimal map strategy ( see also @xcite ) .    in each of the above cases , the benchmarks deal with the case of teleportation or storage of _ single _ input states drawn from a set , in a bayesian or pointwise set - up . to date",
    ", there exist no nontrivial benchmarks for the transmission of multiple copies of quantum states  a ` quantum register '  in particular for an ensemble of @xmath0 independent and identically - distributed ( i.i.d . ) qubits .",
    "such a task comes as a primitive in distributed quantum communication .",
    "quantum registers can be locally initialised and then transferred to remote processing units where a quantum computation is going to take place .",
    "also , in hybrid interfaces between light and matter @xcite , storage and retrieval of e.g. coherent states , involves mapping the state of @xmath0 i.i.d .",
    "atoms onto a light mode ( back and forth ) . therefore , strictly speaking , a quantum benchmark for this precise input ensemble would be needed to assess the success of the experiment . in the current practice",
    "@xcite the problem is circumvented by noting that the collective spin components of the atomic ensemble ( with @xmath7 @xcite ) approximately satisfy canonical commutation relations , henceforth the atomic system is treated _ a priori _ as a cv system , and the corresponding benchmarks are used .    in this paper",
    "we put this procedure on firm grounds , by proving rigorously that the optimal map scheme for teleportation and storage of @xmath0 i.i.d .",
    "mixed _ qubits converges when @xmath8 to the optimal map scheme for a single - mode displaced thermal state .",
    "additionally , we also prove that the heterodyne measurement followed by the preparation of a coherent state is optimal map scheme for displaced thermal states when the figure of merit is the trace norm distance .",
    "the same scheme is known to be optimal for thermal and squeezed states , but for a figure of merit based on overlap fidelity @xcite .",
    "the key tool in deriving our results is the theory of local asymptotic normality ( lan ) for quantum states which is the quantum extension of a fundamental concept in mathematical statistics introduced by le cam @xcite . in the classical context",
    "this roughly means that a large i.i.d .",
    "sample @xmath9 from an unknown distribution contains approximately the same amount of _ statistical _ information as a single sample from a gaussian ( normal ) distribution with unknown mean and known variance .    in the quantum case",
    ", lan means that the joint ( mixed ) state @xmath10 of @xmath0 identically prepared ( finite dimensional ) quantum systems can be transferred by means of a quantum channel to a quantum - classical gaussian state , with asymptotically vanishing loss of statistical information .",
    "more precisely , for any fixed @xmath11 there exist quantum channels @xmath12 such that @xmath13 converge to zero as @xmath14 , _ uniformly _ over a @xmath15 local neighbourhood of the state @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 is a classical normal distribution and @xmath18 is a gaussian state on an ensemble of oscillators whose means are linear transformations of @xmath19 and the covariance matrices depend only on @xmath11 .",
    "the qubit case is described in detail in section  [ sec.lan ] and the precise result is formulated in theorem [ th.qlan.qubits ] .",
    "the lan theory has been used to find asymptotically optimal estimation procedures for qubits and qudits and to show that the holevo bound for state estimation is achievable .",
    "here we use it to solve the benchmark problem for qubits by casting it into the corresponding one for displaced thermal states .",
    "the following diagram illustrates the asymptotically optimal map scheme : the measurement @xmath20 consists in composing the channel @xmath21 with the heterodyne measurement @xmath22 .",
    "the preparation procedure consists in creating the coherent state @xmath23 and mapping it back to the qubits space by the channel @xmath24 .",
    "the optimality of the scheme is proved in theorem [ th.main ] .",
    "@xmath25    the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec.stat.formulation ]",
    "we give a precise statistical formulation of the benchmark problem , and we explain in some detail the definition of the asymptotic risk .",
    "a brief overview of the necessary classical and quantum concepts from the lan theory is given in section  [ sec.lan ] . in section  [ sec.thermal ]",
    "we then revisit the benchmark problem for displaced thermal states .",
    "when the figure of merit is the overlap fidelity , the solution was found in @xcite to be the heterodyne detection followed by the repreparation of a coherent state .",
    "we solve the same problem using the trace norm loss function , and again find this map scheme to be optimal .",
    "interestingly , the optimality proof is based on the concept of stochastic ordering which was previously used for finding optimal cloning maps for thermal states .",
    "this result allows us to exploit lan and solve the benchmark problem for @xmath0 i.i.d .",
    "qubits in the asymptotic limit @xmath26 . a constructive solution along with a proof of optimality",
    "is given in section  [ sec.qubits ] .",
    "we conclude with discussions in section  [ sec.discussion ] .",
    "the appendix contains additional mathematical details on the lan theory for qubits .",
    "the general statistical formulation of quantum benchmarking is as follows .",
    "let @xmath27 be a quantum model , i.e. a family of quantum states on a hilbert space @xmath28 , indexed by a parameter @xmath29",
    ". in this paper @xmath30 is always an open subset of @xmath31 , i.e. we are in a parametric set - up .",
    "the model encodes our prior information about the state and the parameter @xmath32 is considered to be unknown .",
    "we are given a quantum system prepared in the state @xmath33 and we would like to find the map ( or classical ) channel @xmath34 for which @xmath35 is ` close ' to @xmath36 .",
    "a map channel is the composition @xmath37 of a measurement @xmath38 with outcomes in a measure space @xmath39 , and a repreparation @xmath40 which assigns to every result @xmath41 a state @xmath42 .",
    "there are several natural distance functions on the state space , such as the bures distance @xcite with its associated uhlmann fidelity @xcite , or the trace - norm distance considered in this paper . since @xmath32 is unknown we choose the maximum risk as the overall figure of merit of a scheme @xmath43 @xmath44 alternatively one may use a bayesian risk where the performance at different parameters is weighted by a prior distribution over @xmath30 .",
    "the goal is to find a map scheme with the lowest risk @xmath45 , which will be called a _",
    "minmax scheme_.    the above formulation is particularly suitable in the case of covariant models such as the displaced thermal state treated in section  [ sec.thermal ] or the single qubit case of @xcite .",
    "let us consider now the scenario where we want to teleport @xmath0 identically prepared systems , such as in the case of atomic clouds .",
    "the relevant model is then @xmath46 and we would like to find the optimal map scheme @xmath47 for a given @xmath0 . the experience accumulated in the related domain of state estimation indicates that this problem can rarely be solved explicitly , but becomes tractable in an asymptotic framework .",
    "we adopt this set - up in our benchmark problem and define the local risk of a procedure @xmath48 , around @xmath49 by @xmath50 where unlike formula we take the maximum over a neighbourhood of @xmath11 of size @xmath15 with @xmath51 arbitrary .",
    "the _ asymptotic local risk _ of the sequence @xmath52 is defined by @xmath53 and by definition a map sequence @xmath54 is optimal if it achieves the lowest possible asymptotic local risk at any point @xmath49 .",
    "the latter is called the _ asymptotic minmax risk",
    "_ @xmath55    since the above formula may look rather ad - hoc to the reader who is not familiar with statistical methodology , we would like to explain its meaning in some detail .",
    "first of all , note that we compare the input and output states globally rather than locally on each system .",
    "this means that even though as @xmath56 we get more and more information about the parameter @xmath32 , and we can estimate it with accuracy @xmath57 , in the same time the task of repreparing the state @xmath10 becomes more and more difficult !",
    "this can be easily understood by looking at fidelity in the case of pure states .",
    "let @xmath58 be an estimator of @xmath32 obtained by measuring @xmath59 , so that @xmath60 , and suppose that we reprepare the state @xmath61 .",
    "then    @xmath62 where @xmath63 is an angle of order @xmath64 .",
    "since @xmath65 we see that the input - output fidelity can not converge to @xmath66 .",
    "we will show that this is the case for arbitrary states , and also when we allow for other map schemes .",
    "the second remark concerns the supremum over the small ball @xmath67 in definition . why not consider the supremum over all @xmath32 as we did in the non - asymptotic case ?",
    "the reason is that the global supremum would be overly pessimistic and would be dominated by the region in the parameter space which is hardest for the benchmark problem .",
    "restricting to a ball whose size is roughly that of the uncertainty in the parameter captures the local behaviour of map scheme at each point and is more informative than the global maximum .",
    "the ball should have size @xmath15 because even if @xmath32 is unknown beforehand , it can be localised within such a region by measuring a small proportion @xmath68 of the systems , so that effectively _ we know _ that we are in the local ball , and this should be reflected in the definition of the risk .",
    "the localisation argument is standard in statistics and its application in quantum statistics is detailed in .",
    "finally , the relation between our figure of merit and the bayes risk can be sketched as follows .",
    "if @xmath69 denotes the asymptotically optimal bayes risk for the prior @xmath70 , @xmath71 then under suitable conditions on @xmath70 and the model @xmath72 one obtains @xmath73 the intuitive explanation is that when @xmath14 the features of the prior @xmath70 are washed out and the posterior distribution concentrates in a local neighbourhood of the true parameter , where the behaviour of the map procedures is governed by the local minmax risk .",
    "a full proof of this relation is beyond the scope of this paper ( and will be presented elsewhere ) but the interested reader may consult for the proof of the corresponding statement in the case of state estimation .",
    "in this section we will give a brief , self - contained introduction to the theory of lan in as much detail as it is necessary for this paper and we refer to for proofs and more analysis .",
    "lan is a fundamental concept in mathematical statistics introduced by the french statistician le cam @xcite .",
    "it roughly means that a large i.i.d .",
    "sample @xmath9 from an unknown distribution contains approximately the same amount of statistical information as a single sample from a gaussian distribution with unknown mean and known variance .",
    "more precisely if @xmath74 has distribution @xmath75 depending ` smoothly ' on a finite dimensional parameter @xmath76 , then in a @xmath64-size neighbourhood of any point @xmath11 , the statistical model @xmath77 is well approximated by a simpler gaussian shift model @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the local unknown parameter of the distribution , and @xmath80 is the inverse fisher information matrix at @xmath11 .",
    "note that this approximation holds only locally , reflecting the intrinsic uncertainty in the unknown parameter for the sample size @xmath0 , which should not be seen as an additional assumption about @xmath32 .",
    "indeed , the parameter can always be localised in such a region using a preliminary estimator , with vanishing probability of failure .",
    "the point of this approximation is to reduce a statistical problems ( e.g. estimation ) about the more complex model @xmath81 to a simpler problem about the gaussian model @xmath82 .",
    "local asymptotic normality also provides a convenient description of quantum statistical models involving i.i.d . quantum systems .",
    "here the idea is : when the quantum ` sample ' is large , the model can be approximated by a simpler quantum gaussian model .",
    "if this approximation holds in a sufficiently strong sense , then statistical problems about the qubits model can be reformulated in terms of the gaussian one , without any loss of optimality .    in quantum statistics",
    "this technique has been used for optimal state estimation with completely unknown finite dimensional quantum states , for optimal classification ( learning ) of spin states , for state transfer between matter and light . in the physics literature",
    ", lan is used in an informal way to describe the dynamics of atomic gases in a simplified gaussian approximation , in quantum memories and quantum metrology with spin coherent and squeezed states .",
    "we are given @xmath0 independent identically prepared spin-@xmath1 particles ( qubits ) in a state @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the bloch vector of the state and @xmath85 are the pauli matrices in @xmath86 .",
    "although a priori the state @xmath87 is completely unknown , the following argument shows that that without loss of generality we can assume it to be _ localised _ within a small ball of size @xmath15 where @xmath88 is arbitrarily small .",
    "indeed by measuring a small proportion @xmath68 of the systems we can devise an initial rough estimator @xmath89 so that with high probability the state is in a ball of size @xmath15 around @xmath90 ( see lemma 2.1 in ) .",
    "we label the states in this ball by the local parameter @xmath91 @xmath92 and define the local statistical model by @xmath93    by choosing the reference frame with its @xmath94 axis along @xmath95 we find that up to @xmath96 terms the state @xmath97 is obtained by perturbing the eigenvalues of @xmath90 and rotating it with a ` small unitary '    @xmath98 where @xmath99      the asymptotic behaviour of the multiple spins state can be intuitively explained through the ` big bloch sphere ' picture commonly used to describe spin coherent @xcite and spin squeezed states",
    ". let @xmath100 be the collective spin components along the reference frame directions . by the central limit theorem ,",
    "the distributions of @xmath101 with respect to @xmath102 converge as @xmath103 so that the joint spins state can be pictured as a vector of length @xmath104 whose tip has a gaussian blob of size @xmath105 representing the uncertainty in the collective variables ( see figure [ fig.big.ball ] ) .",
    "further more , by a law of large numbers argument we evaluate the commutators @xmath106= 2i \\frac{1}{n } l_{z } \\approx   2i r_{0 } \\mathbf{1},\\\\ & & \\left[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n } } l_{x , y } , \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n } } l_{z}\\right ] \\approx 0 .",

    "mixed states.,width=264 ]    as for the third component , @xmath112 converges to a _ classical _ gaussian variable @xmath113 which is independent of the quantum state .",
    "how does the limit change when we perturb the state of the spins ?",
    "by the same argument we find that the variables @xmath114 pick up expectations which ( in the first order in @xmath64 ) are proportional to the local parameters @xmath115 while the variances remain unchanged .",
    "more precisely the oscillator is in a displaced thermal equilibrium state @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the displacement operator @xmath118 and the classical part has distribution @xmath119 .",
    "we have thus identified the limit gaussian model which is a tensor product of a classical distribution and a quantum state , which together can be seen as a state ( positive normal functional ) on the von neumann algebra @xmath120 .",
    "[ def.quantum.gaussian.shift ] the quantum gaussian shift model @xmath121 is defined by the family of quantum - classical states @xmath122 on @xmath120 .    in the next subsection",
    "we formulate a precise statement about the convergence to the gaussian model which goes beyond the central limit type argument presented above .",
    "the notion of strong convergence of classical statistical models was introduced by le cam and is based on defining a natural distance between statistical models with the same parameter space , so that models models at zero distance are statistically equivalent and models which are close , have similar behaviour for ` regular ' statistical decision problems .",
    "the existing results on quantum sufficiency and quantum lan indicate the existence of a theory of quantum decision and convergence of models .    in the classical set - up the distance between models",
    "is defined operationally , in terms of randomisations which can be seen as the classical counterpart of quantum channels .",
    "a positive linear map @xmath123 is called a stochastic operator ( or randomisation ) if @xmath124 for every @xmath125 .",
    "since we work with models which may contain both classical and quantum ` states ' we will call a channel , a completely positive , normalised map between preduals of von neumann algebras .",
    "in finite dimensions , this reduces to the familiar notion of a channel , this time with _ block - diagonal _ input and output density matrices .",

    "the le cam distance between @xmath137 and @xmath72 is @xmath138    with this definition we can formulate the strong convergence of the sequence @xmath139 of i.i.d .",

    "then @xmath142 i.e. there exist sequences of channels @xmath21 and @xmath24 such that    @xmath143    let us make a few comments on the significance of the above result .",
    "the first point is that lan provides a stronger characterisation of the ` gaussian approximation ' than the usual central limit theorem arguments .",
    "indeed the convergence in theorem [ th.qlan.qubits ] is strong ( in @xmath136 ) rather than weak ( in distribution ) , it is _ uniform _ over a range of local parameters rather than at a single point , and has an operational meaning based on quantum channels .",
    "secondly , one can exploit these features to devise asymptotically optimal measurement strategies for state estimation which can be implemented in practice by coupling with a bosonic bath and performing continuous time measurements in the bath .",
    "thirdly , the result is not restricted to state estimation but can be applied to a range of quantum statistical problems involving i.i.d .",
    "qubit states such as cloning , teleportation benchmarks , quantum learning , and can serve as a mathematical framework for analysing quantum state transfer protocols .    for completeness , we give a brief review of the main ideas involved in the proof of theorem [ th.qlan.qubits ] and the description of channels @xmath144 in the appendix .",

    "this can be done by choosing @xmath327 small enough and @xmath0 large enough .",
    "the problem of finding an optimal map reconstruction scheme for a family of quantum states has attracted significant attention due to its relevance in establishing fidelity benchmarks for teleportation and state storage . in the case of a family of displaced thermal ( and coherent ) states with unknown displacement",
    "the problem was solved in @xcite and the optimal procedure is the heterodyne measurement followed by the preparation of a coherent state .",
    "we showed that the same map procedure is again optimal for this family of states , with a more natural figure of merit - the trace norm distance .",
    "moreover , in the case of i.i.d .",
    "mixed qubit states , the benchmark problem can be solved asymptotically by mapping it to the previous problem , using lan theory .",
    "interestingly , the same heterodyne measurement is also optimal from the point of view of state estimation @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in @xcite it was shown that for a particular family of states in @xmath328 , the optimal map scheme involves a measurement which is different from the optimal one for state estimation .",
    "one of our motivations was to see whether this peculiarity survives in the asymptotic limit , and the conclusion is that for large @xmath0 the estimation and benchmarking can be performed optimally _ simultaneously _ , i.e. their measurement parts are identical .",
    "another difference between benchmarking and estimation pointed out in @xcite refers to the preparation part of the protocols .",
    "more exactly , it turns out that in the case of a special family of one qubit pure states , the optimal re - prepared state _ does not _",
    "belong to the family .",
    "however , our asymptotic benchmark for qubits can be easily extended to treat the case of pure rather than mixed states and the result is that _ asymptotically _ , the optimal re - prepared state _ is _ in the original model .",
    "thus the effect pointed out in @xcite is due to the particular geometry of the states space in the one sample situation , which ` linearises ' asymptotically .",
    "to briefly explain our claim , note that asymptotically , the parameter space reduces effectively to a small interval and the tangent space approximation kicks in .",
    "then the problem is transferred to that of finding the benchmark for a family of coherent states _ on a line _ , where the solution is a homodyne measurement followed by the preparation of a coherent state _ in the family_.    oh the other hand , we have seen that in the case of mixed states , the re - prepared state is pure , hence not in the family , even in the asymptotic framework .",
    "however this fact is not surprising as it happens already in the classical case : if @xmath329 is a random variable with distribution @xmath330 then the best ` re - preparation ' is the ` pure state ' represented by the @xmath331 measure @xmath332 leading to a trivial benchmark .",
    "if @xmath330 is not a @xmath331 measure itself then the re - prepared ` state ' @xmath332 is outside the model .",
    "we give here a brief review of the main ideas involved in the proof of theorem [ th.qlan.qubits ] and the description of channels @xmath144 .",
    "on @xmath265 we have two _ commuting _ unitary group representations @xmath333 where @xmath334 and @xmath335 , with @xmath336 denoting the symmetric group . by weyl s theorem",
    ", the representation space decomposes into a direct sum of tensor products @xmath337 where @xmath338 is half - integer , @xmath339 is an irreducible representation of @xmath340 , and @xmath341 is the irreducible representation of @xmath336 . since the density matrix @xmath342 is invariant under permutations , it has a block diagonal form @xmath343    this can be interpreted as being given a random variable @xmath344 with distribution @xmath345 and conditionally on @xmath346 , a quantum state @xmath347 .",
    "the classical and quantum components of the ` data ' will be ` processed ' by randomising @xmath344 and mapping @xmath347 through a quantum channel .",
    "_ classical component._ each block is an eigenspace of the total spin operator @xmath348 with eigenvalue @xmath349 . as the big bloch ball argument suggests , the main contribution to @xmath350 comes from @xmath351 so that the distribution @xmath345 can be approximated by the binomial @xmath352,\\ ] ] with @xmath353 .",
    "the fact that @xmath345 converges to @xmath354 follows now from the classical version of lan @xcite for i.i.d .",
    "samples of binary variables .",
    "we first constructs the rescaled variable @xmath355 but since @xmath356 has a discrete probability distribution , we need to ` smooth ' it by randomising with e.g. a gaussian markov kernel of variance @xmath357 @xmath358      _ quantum component._ conditionally on obtaining @xmath346 in the which - block measurement , we are left with a quantum state @xmath347 on @xmath359",
    ". the action of @xmath21 will be to imbed it into the quantum oscillator space by the isometry @xmath360 define below .",
    "the quantum central limit theorem suggests that the properly normalised operators @xmath365 converge to the annihilation and creation operators @xmath157 when @xmath366 .",
    "since they act as ladder operators @xmath367 it is natural to define the isometry @xmath368 defining the embedding ( channel ) @xmath369      the channel @xmath24 is basically an inverse of @xmath21 : the normal distribution is discretised to produce the distribution @xmath371 and the quantum gaussian state is compressed to the first @xmath372 levels and mapped to @xmath359 with the co - isometry @xmath373 . for more details on the proof we refer to .",

    "alternative approaches to the derivation of benchmarks for quantum channels , such as memory or teleportation channels , have been then pursued @xcite .",
    "these benchmarks , using entanglement - verification tools such as the ` expectation value matrix ' , directly assess the ability of quantum transmission channels ( as realized in an experiment ) to preserve entangled states , as opposed to map channels which are entanglement - breaking . such testing procedures , encompassing also the realistic possibility of using mixed states to probe the quantum channels , might be verified with very few experimental resources ."
