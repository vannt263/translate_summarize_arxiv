    "the superconducting gap is a fundamental property of superconductors @xcite , and the nature of its anisotropy has played a crucial role in the testing of the microscopic theory of superconductivity in cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "experimentally , by virtue of systematic measurements @xcite , particularly using the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) technique @xcite , the d - wave nature of the superconducting gap has been well established by now . in particular , this d - wave superconducting symmetry remains one of the cornerstones of our understanding of the physics in cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "the early arpes measurements on the cuprate superconductor bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite showed that in the real space the gap function and the pairing force have a range of one lattice spacing , and then the superconducting gap function is of the monotonic d - wave form @xmath2/2 $ ] .",
    "later , the arpes measurements on the cuprate superconductor bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite indicated that the superconducting gap significantly deviates from this monotonic d - wave form .",
    "furthermore , it was argued that this deviation should be attributed to an increase of the electron correlation , which may increase the intensity of the higher order of the harmonic component in the monotonic d - wave gap function @xcite .",
    "however , recent arpes measurements @xcite on the cuprate superconductors ( bi , pb)@xmath0(sr , la)@xmath0cuo@xmath3 and bi@xmath0sr@xmath4@xmath5@xmath6cuo@xmath3 ( @xmath5-bi2201 ) with @xmath5=la , nd , and gd showed that a much stronger deviation from the monotonic d - wave superconducting gap form is unlikely to be due to the strong correlation effect .",
    "the cuprate superconductors have a layered structure consisting of the two - dimensional cuo@xmath0 layers separated by insulating layers @xcite .",
    "the single common feature is the presence of the cuo@xmath0 plane @xcite , and it seems evident that the unusual behaviors of cuprate superconductors are dominated by this cuo@xmath0 plane @xcite .",
    "it has been well established that the cu@xmath7 ions exhibit an antiferromagnetic long - range order in the parent compounds of cuprate superconductors , and superconductivity occurs when the antiferromagnetic long - range order state is suppressed by doped charge carriers @xcite .",
    "since these doped charge carriers are induced by the replacement of ions by those with different valences or the addition of excess oxygens in the block layer , therefore in principle , all cuprate superconductors have naturally impurities ( or disorder ) .",
    "however , for the cuprate superconductors ( bi , pb)@xmath0(sr , la)@xmath0cuo@xmath3 and @xmath5-bi2201 , the mismatch in the ionic radius between bi and pb or sr and @xmath5 causes the _ out - of - plane impurities _",
    "@xcite , where the concentration of the out - of - plane impurities is controlled by varying the radius of the pb or @xmath5 ions , and then the superconducting transition temperature @xmath8 is found to be decreasing with increasing impurity concentration .",
    "these cuprate superconductors ( bi , pb)@xmath0(sr , la)@xmath0cuo@xmath3 and @xmath5-bi2201 are often referred to as the out - of - plane impurity - controlled cuprate superconductors . recently , the electronic structure of the out - of - plane impurity - controlled cuprate superconductors and the related superconducting gap function have been investigated experimentally by using arpes @xcite .",
    "it was shown that although the effect of the out - of - plane impurity scattering around the antinodal region is much stronger than that around the nodal region , both superconducting coherence peaks around the nodal and antinodal regions are suppressed .",
    "furthermore , the magnitude of the deviation from the monotonic d - wave superconducting gap form increases with increasing impurity concentration @xcite .",

    "this strong deviation from the monotonic d - wave superconducting gap form in the out - of - plane impurity - controlled cuprate superconductors has not been treated starting from a microscopic superconducting theory yet .    in the absence of out - of - plane impurity scattering",
    ", the electronic structure of cuprate superconductors in the superconducting state has been discussed @xcite within the framework of the kinetic energy driven superconductivity @xcite , where the superconducting gap function has a monotonic d - wave form , and the main features of the arpes experiments @xcite on cuprate superconductors have been reproduced . in this paper , we study the electronic structure of the out - of - plane impurity - controlled cuprate superconductors in the superconducting state and the related superconducting gap function along with this line .",
    "we employ the @xmath9-@xmath10 model by considering the out - of - plane impurity scattering , and then show explicitly that the strong deviation from the monotonic d - wave superconducting gap form occurs due to the presence of the impurity scattering . although both sharp superconducting coherence peaks around the nodal and the antinodal regions are suppressed , the effect of the impurity scattering is stronger in the antinodal region than that in the nodal region . our results also show that the electronic structure of the out - of - plane impurity - controlled cuprate superconductors in the superconducting state can be understood within the framework of the kinetic energy driven superconducting mechanism with the out - of - plane impurity scattering taken into account .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the basic formalism of the electronic structure calculation in the presence of the out - of - plane impurities . within this theoretical framework , we discuss the electronic structure of the out - of - plane impurity - controlled cuprate superconductors in the superconducting state and the related superconducting gap function in sec .",
    "iii , where we show that the well pronounced deviation from the monotonic d - wave superconducting gap form is mainly caused by the out - of - plane impurity scattering .",
    "finally , we give a summary in sec . iv .",
    "it has been shown that the essential physics of cuprate superconductors is properly accounted by the two - dimensional @xmath9-@xmath10 model on a square lattice @xcite , @xmath11 acting on the hilbert subspace with no doubly occupied site , i.e. , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron with spin @xmath17 , @xmath18 are spin operators , and @xmath19 is the chemical potential . to deal with the constraint of no double occupancy in analytical calculations , the charge - spin separation fermion - spin theory",
    "@xcite has been developed , where the constrained electron operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 are decoupled as @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , here the spinful fermion operator @xmath24 describes the charge degree of freedom together with some effects of spin configuration rearrangements due to the presence of the doped charge carrier itself , while the spin operator @xmath25 describes the spin degree of freedom , then the electron on - site local constraint for the single occupancy , @xmath26 , is satisfied in analytical calculations . in particular , it has been shown that under the decoupling scheme , this charge - spin separation fermion - spin representation is a natural representation of the constrained electron defined in the hilbert subspace without double electron occupancy @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these charge carrier and spin are gauge invariant @xcite , and in this sense they are real and can be interpreted as physical excitations @xcite . in this charge - spin separation fermion - spin representation , the @xmath9-@xmath10 model ( 1 ) can be expressed as , @xmath27 with @xmath28 , and @xmath29 being the charge carrier doping concentration .",
    "this @xmath30 is similar to that obtained in gutzwiller approach @xcite . as an important consequence ,",
    "the kinetic energy term in the @xmath9-@xmath10 model has been transferred as the interaction between charge carriers and spins , which reflects that even the kinetic energy term in the @xmath9-@xmath10 hamiltonian has a strong coulombic contribution due to the restriction of no double occupancy of a given site .",
    "this interaction from the kinetic energy term is quite strong , and it has been shown @xcite in terms of the eliashberg s strong coupling theory @xcite that in the case without an antiferromagnetic long - range order , this interaction can induce a charge carrier pairing state ( then the electron cooper pairing state ) with d - wave symmetry by exchanging spin excitations in the higher power of the charge carrier doping concentration @xmath31 . in this case , the electron cooper pairs originating from the charge carrier pairing state are due to the charge - spin recombination , and their condensation reveals the d - wave superconducting ground - state . furthermore , this d - wave superconducting state is controlled by both the superconducting gap function and the quasiparticle coherence , which leads to the fact that the maximal superconducting transition temperature occurs around the optimal doping , and then decreases in both underdoped and overdoped regimes @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown @xcite that this superconducting state is the conventional bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) like @xcite with the d - wave symmetry , so that the basic bcs formalism with the d - wave superconducting gap function is still valid in quantitatively reproducing all main low energy features of the arpes experimental measurements on cuprate superconductors , although the pairing mechanism is driven by the kinetic energy by exchanging spin excitations , and other exotic magnetic scattering @xcite is beyond the bcs formalism .",
    "following previous discussions @xcite , the full charge carrier green s function in the superconducting state with a monotonic d - wave gap function can be obtained in the nambu representation as @xcite , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the unit matrix , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the pauli matrices , the renormalized charge carrier excitation spectrum @xmath36 , with the mean - field charge carrier excitation spectrum @xmath37 , the spin correlation functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the number of the nearest neighbor or next nearest neighbor sites , the renormalized charge carrier monotonic d - wave pair gap function @xmath43 , where the effective charge carrier monotonic d - wave pair gap function @xmath44 with @xmath45 , and the charge carrier quasiparticle spectrum @xmath46 .",

    "although this out - of - plane impurity effect in cuprate superconductors can also be discussed starting directly from a phenomenological d - wave bcs formalism @xcite , in this paper we are primarily interested in exploring the general notion of the effects of the out - of - plane impurity scatterers in the kinetic energy driven cuprate superconductors in the superconducting state .",
    "the qualitative agreement between the present theoretical results and arpes experimental data also indicates that the presence of the out - of - plane impurities has a crucial impact on the electronic structure of cuprate superconductors . on the other hand , we emphasize that the quasiparticle scattering rate in the antinodal region is strongly increased by the impurity scattering potential ( 12 ) , while the nodal quasiparticles are very weakly scattered by the impurity scattering potential ( 12 ) ,",

    "in conclusion , we have shown very clearly in this paper that if the out - of - plane impurity scattering is taken into account within the framework of the kinetic energy driven d - wave superconductivity @xcite , the quasiparticle spectrum of the @xmath9-@xmath10 model calculated based on the off - diagonal impurity scattering potential ( 12 ) per se can correctly reproduce some main features found in the arpes measurements on the out - of - plane impurity - controlled cuprate superconductors in the superconducting state @xcite . in the presence of the out - of - plane impurities , although both sharp superconducting coherence peaks around the nodal and antinodal regions are suppressed , the effect of the impurity scattering is stronger in the antinodal region than that in the nodal region , this leads to a strong deviation from the monotonic d - wave superconducting gap form in the out - of - plane impurity - controlled cuprate superconductors .",
    "finally , we have noted that within a phenomenological bcs approach , the electron spectral properties of the underdoped cuprates as resulting from a momentum dependent pseudogap in the _ normal state _ have been discussed @xcite , where a normal state pseudogap function deviating from the monotonic d - wave pseudogap form has been used to fit the arpes experimental data in the normal state .",

    "<S> the electronic structure of cuprate superconductors is studied within the kinetic energy driven superconducting mechanism in the presence of out - of - plane impurities . with increasing impurity concentration , </S>",
    "<S> although both superconducting coherence peaks around the nodal and antinodal regions are suppressed , the position of the leading - edge mid - point of the electron spectrum around the nodal region remains at the same position , whereas around the antinodal region it is shifted towards higher binding energies , this leads to a strong deviation from the monotonic d - wave superconducting gap in the out - of - plane impurity - controlled cuprate superconductors . </S>"
