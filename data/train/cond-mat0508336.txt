    "one place where the study of macroscopic quantum tunnelling is particularly experimentally accessible is in the tunnelling of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) out of an optical trap .",
    "recently , we showed that optical traps , which are of finite depth , can support both bound and quasi - bound states , and that the nonlinearity of the bec mean field can be used to tune between them  @xcite . in this article , we calculate the lifetime of such quasi - bound states for both the ground state and excited soliton and vortex states .",
    "this provides a straightforward experimental observable for the occurrence of macroscopic quantum tunnelling of a bec .",
    "bec s exhibit different kinds of tunnelling phenomena .",
    "we consider the most direct generalization of the single - particle case  @xcite , the tunnelling of the mean field through a barrier via the gross - pitaevskii , or nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls )  @xcite .",

    "there have been various theoretical studies related to these experiments  @xcite .",
    "this is to be contrasted with tunnelling of the whole condensate in a variational parameter space , as was previously considered in the context of the collapse of a metastable attractive bec in three dimensions  @xcite and in quantum evaporation of a bright soliton in an expulsive harmonic trap  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we consider a spherically symmetric trap in the form of a parabolic potential times a gaussian , where the width of the gaussian envelope is much greater than the harmonic oscillator length .",

    "we take advantage of semi - classical methods and employ a variational - wkb formalism to calculate the lifetime of the condensate held in such a potential  @xcite . in addition , we calculate three critical values of the nonlinearity which could be observed in experiments : the point at which the condensate collapses , termed the _ collapse nonlinearity _ ; the point at which the quasi - bound states are transformed into bound states , called the _ critical nonlinearity _ ; and the point at which the condensate is pushed out over the top of the potential and quasi - bound states cease to exist at all , called the _",

    "the maximum nonlinearity is observable as the point where the condensate commences to expand .",
    "we emphasize that even at the level of the mean field approximation , there are features that are distinctly different from the tunnelling of a single particle . as the tunnelling rate depends on the number of atoms remaining in the well , the lifetime is not simply inversely proportional to the rate as in the linear schrdinger equation , but",
    "must be determined by an integral over each step of the tunnelling .",

    "a technical point concerning two dimensions is that there is always an additional solution with large @xmath106 which is radially unstable within the context of our gaussian ansatz and the vk criterion .",
    "this corresponds to a ring of condensate around the trap .",
    "its variational form and stability can be more appropriately investigated with a vortex - like ansatz , as we briefly discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : vortex ] .    a clear experimental signature for a quasi - bound to bound state transition is a change in the lifetime of the condensate .",
    "suppose that the lifetime due to tunnelling of the wave function is on the order of or much less than that imposed by three body processes , scattering with the background gas in the vacuum , and other sources of loss .",
    "one can then determine the difference between a quasi - bound and bound state by measuring the number of atoms in the trap as a function of time .",
    "it is necessary to choose the right experimental parameters in order to have a realistically observable lifetime .",
    "for instance , typical bec lifetimes are on the order of ten to a hundred seconds .",

    "[ fig:4 ] corresponds to 16 ms to 16 s. thus the trap parameters chosen for the figure result in experimentally observable lifetimes .",
    "the relationship between the tunnelling rate , defined by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rate ] ) , and the lifetime , defined by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : lifetime ] ) , can be very non - intuitive with respect to what is known from single - particle tunnelling in the linear schrdinger equation .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](c ) the lifetime approaches zero on the left hand side as @xmath113 .",
    "this can be physically understood in terms of the tunnelling of the wavefunction through the effective potential .",
    "as the real part of the chemical potential approaches zero from above , so that the quasi - bound state becomes a bound state , the attractive nonlinearity pulls down the potential barrier .",
    "that is , the effective potential barrier shrinks . in the case of three dimensions , and for @xmath114 , it is well - known that the attractive nonlinearity can dominate over both the kinetic energy and the potential energy , leading to strong self - focusing and collapse .",
    "here , one observes that the attractive nonlinearity already dominates over the potential energy barrier for @xmath115 .",
    "this causes the _ effective _ potential barrier to disappear for a very narrow region of @xmath116 near the formation of the bound state , so that the lifetime goes to zero .",
    "this region is so narrow that it is not experimentally relevant , since number fluctuations can not be finely controlled in bec experiments , and @xmath117 .",
    "one can more rigorously understand the limiting values of the lifetime in the form of the power law of the tunnelling rate @xmath40 as @xmath118 .",
    "suppose the power law takes the form @xmath119where @xmath120 is a real positive constant and @xmath121 can be zero , @xmath58 , or @xmath59 , depending on the allowed domain of quasi - bound states ( see the discussion of the appropriate integration limits following eq .",
    "( [ eqn : lifetime ] ) ) . by expanding the integral according to @xmath122 , one finds that for @xmath123 the lifetime approaches zero , despite the rate approaching zero . for @xmath124",
    "the lifetime approaches infinity , while for @xmath125 it approaches a nonzero constant .",

    "we calculated four experimental observables : the lifetime @xmath55 of quasi - bound condensates ; the maximum nonlinearity @xmath58 for which a quasi - bound state exists ; the critical nonlinearity @xmath59 for which a quasi - bound state becomes a bound state ; and , for two and three dimensions , the collapse nonlinearity @xmath163 .    by adjusting the initial number of atoms and/or the atomic interaction strength ,",
    "as may be achieved via a feshbach resonance  @xcite , we showed how a quasi - bound condensate can be adiabatically transformed into a bound one , and vice versa .",
    "we presented in detail the parameter regimes in which such a transformation can be performed for both repulsive and attractive condensates . in two dimensions",
    ", we found that the relations @xmath164 always hold ; in three dimensions , it is necessary to add a negative offset to the potential at @xmath165 in order to observe the quasi - bound to bound transition without provoking collapse of the condensate .",
    "this offset can be constructed with an off - resonant blue- or red - detuned laser focused at the origin of the trap .",
    "we found that , for reasonable experimental parameters , one could observe the tunnelling of a bec through the walls of an optical trap on time scales of 10 milliseconds to 10 seconds .",
    "we showed that tunnelling can lead to a final state which is quite different from that obtained via the linear schrdinger equation . for @xmath166 ,",
    "an initially quasi - bound repulsive condensate approaches a bound state with a finite number of atoms remaining in the well . for @xmath167",
    "an initially quasi - bound attractive condensate approaches an unbound state for which the atoms spill out over the top of the well .",
    "this is observable as a pair of counter - propagating bright solitons in one dimension , and as an azimuthally unstable bright ring soliton in two dimensions  @xcite .",
    "we showed previously that our variational - wkb method accurately determines the tunnelling rate and critical points at the level of 1% or better , except near the collapse points , where it is accurate to within about 10%  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to test our method via exact solution with a small number of atoms .",
    "for example , it has been shown that mean field effects are strongly evident in as few as three bosons confined in an external potential  @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that there is a direct analogy between the operation of a laser and the tunnelling of a bec through the walls of an optical trap . in a laser",
    "operating well above threshold , the coherent state in the cavity is robust against removal of single photons via tunnelling through a thin barrier .",
    "this is the essence of a coherent state .",
    "the mean field of the bose condensate in an optical trap is phase - coherent and robust in the same way .",
    "therefore we expect our mean field approximation to be an excellent one for a large initial number of atoms in the trap .",
    "when the initial number of atoms becomes very small , the condensate is liable to phase fluctuations .",
    "however , as our lifetime definition and figures have the right single - particle limit for zero mean field , we expect that the mean field theory also gives good results in this region .",
