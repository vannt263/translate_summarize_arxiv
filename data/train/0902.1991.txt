    "it is quite remarkable that elements heavier than helium exist in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) only @xmath14gyr after the big bang , as indicated by the presence of metal absorption lines associated with the ly@xmath15  forest of high redshift qsos ( songaila 2001 ; becker et al .",
    "2006 ; ryan - weber , pettini & madau 2006 ; simcoe 2006 ) . for these elements to be observed there",
    "needs to be significant star formation prior to redshift @xmath16 , and the nucleosynthetic products of such early stars need to be expelled beyond the gravitational influence of their host galaxies .",
    "the production of early metals is closely linked to the emission of the lyman continuum ( lyc ) photons responsible for ionizing the igm and ending the so - called `` dark ages '' ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; fan , carilli , & keating 2006 ) , a process which could have started as early as @xmath17 and continued until completion at @xmath18 ( dunkley et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "clearly , some galaxies were already actively forming stars at @xmath19 .",
    "the current record for a spectroscopically confirmed galaxy is held by the ly@xmath15  emitter at @xmath20 discovered by iye et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , but several candidates selected via the redshifted lyman break have been found at @xmath21 ( stark et al .",
    "2007 ; richard et al . 2008 ; bouwens et al . 2008 and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , analyses of the broad - band spectra of galaxies at redshifts @xmath22 have in several cases revealed objects with ` mature ' stellar populations , suggesting that star formation in these galaxies was underway well before @xmath16 ( shapley et al .",
    "2001 ; shapley et al .",
    "2005 ; yan et al .",
    "2006 ; eyles et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "whether the level of star formation so far accounted for at @xmath19 is in fact sufficient to maintain reionization is far less certain , because it depends on a number of essentially unknown parameters , especially the escape fraction of lyman continuum photons from the sites of star formation , the degree of clumping of the sources and of the igm , and the slope of the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function at these early times ( madau , haardt , & rees 1999 ) . using the luminosity function of bouwens et al .",
    "( 2006 ) at @xmath23 and assuming an escape fraction of 20% , bolton & haehnelt ( 2007 ) concluded that there may be _ just enough _ lyc photons to keep the igm ionised , suggesting that cosmic reionization was a ` photon starved ' process ( see also gnedin 2008 ) .",
    "qsos are unlikely to help matters , since their contribution to the metagalactic photoionization rate at these redshifts is estimated to be at most 15% ( srbinovsky & wyithe 2007 ) .",
    "bolton & haehnelt ( 2007 ) proposed that , in order to complete reionization by @xmath23 , either the escape fraction of lyc photons must have been higher at earlier times , or the ionizing spectrum must have been harder ( or both ) .",
    "alternatively , the faint end slope of the luminosity function may have been steeper at @xmath19 compared to the luminosity function determined by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , as indeed proposed by stark et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .    the cosmic budget of elements produced via stellar nucleosynthesis ( loosely referred to as metals ) provides an entirely different , and complementary , census of the star - formation activity prior to a given epoch .",
    "indeed , at redshifts @xmath24 there appears to be an approximate agreement ( within a factor of about two ) between the observed metal budget  summing together the contributions of stars , igm and diffuse gas in galaxies  and expectations based on the integral of the cosmic star formation rate density over the first 2 - 3gyr of the universe history ( pettini 2006 ; bouch et al .",
    "2007 ) .    at higher redshifts , we rely increasingly on the ly@xmath15  forest and gamma - ray burst afterglows to trace metals in the igm and in galaxies , since at @xmath0 the spectra of even the most luminous galaxies are too faint to be studied in detail with current instrumentation .",
    "the most commonly encountered metal lines associated with the ly@xmath15  forest are the civ  @xmath25 doublet ( cowie et al .",
    "1995 ; ellison et al .",
    "photoionisation modelling ( schaye et al . 2003 ; simcoe , sargent , & rauch 2004 ) suggests that at redshifts @xmath24 the carbon abundance is a function of the gas density , as expected ( cen & ostriker 1999 ) , and that the mean metallicity of the igm is @xmath26 .",
    "interestingly , the comoving mass density of triply ionised carbon , obtained by integrating the distribution of column densities @xmath27(civ ) , appears to be approximately constant from @xmath28 to @xmath29 : expressed as a fraction of the critical density , @xmath30 ( songaila 2001 ; pettini et al .",
    "2003mpc@xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 cosmology used in this paper .",
    "] ) over a period of @xmath34gyr which saw the peak of the cosmic star - formation and massive black hole activity ( e.g. reddy et al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) .",
    "this surprising result has led to conflicting interpretations as to the source of these intergalactic metals , with some authors ( e.g. madau , ferrara , & rees 2001 ; porciani & madau 2005 ) proposing an origin in low - mass galaxies at @xmath35 , when the pollution of large volumes of the igm would have been easier , while others ( e.g adelberger 2005 ) place them much closer to the massive galaxies responsible for most of the metal production at redshifts @xmath365 .",
    "while both processes presumably contribute , their relative importance has yet to be established with certainty ( songaila 2006 ) .",
    "the most extensive theoretical work in this area has been published by b.  d.   oppenheimer and collaborators . in a series of papers ( oppenheimer & dav 2006 , 2008 ; dav & oppenheimer 2007 ) these authors analysed the output of cosmological simulations of galaxy formation which include feedback in the form of momentum - driven winds .",
    "they found that the apparent lack of evolution of @xmath11 from @xmath37 to 1.5 can be explained as the result of two countervailing effects : an overall increase of the cosmic abundance of carbon , reflecting the on - going pace of star formation , and an accompanying reduction in the fraction of carbon which is triply ionised .    whether this is the true picture or",
    "not , it is clear that determining @xmath11 at @xmath0 is the next observational priority ; in any case , metal lines are our only remaining probe of the igm at these high redshifts where the ly@xmath15  forest itself becomes effectively opaque .",
    "such an extension of metal - line surveys in qso spectra necessitates observations at moderate spectral resolution and signal - to - noise ratio at near - infrared ( near - ir ) wavelengths , a regime which has only recently begun to be exploited for such purposes ( e.g. kobayashi et al .",
    "2002 ; nissen et al .",
    "2007 ) . in a pilot study",
    "( ryan - weber , pettini , & madau 2006 ) , we demonstrated that qso absorption line spectroscopy could indeed be performed in the near - ir to the levels required to detect intergalactic civ absorption . from observations of two qso at redshifts @xmath38 and 5.99 we discovered two strong civ doublets at absorption redshifts @xmath39 and 5.8290 .",
    "these two absorbers , which were confirmed by an independent study by simcoe ( 2006 ) , would  if typical imply that a high concentration of civ was already in place in the igm at @xmath23 , but clearly much better statistics than those afforded by only two qso sight - lines are necessary to assess the true level of @xmath11 .    given the success of our pilot study , in the last two years we have conducted an observational campaign on the keck and eso - vlt telescopes aimed at securing near - ir spectra of as many as possible of the 19 known qsos with @xmath1 and infrared magnitude @xmath40 .",
    "the results of this programme are presented here .",
    "specifically , we have observed 13 qsos and obtained useful data for ten of them .",

    "the values of emission redshift @xmath54 listed in table  [ tab : obs ] are those measured from the discovery spectra , unless otherwise noted .      with nirspec we used the nirspec  1@xmath73thin blocker filter combination to record the wavelength region @xmath7611170on the aladdin-3 insb detector which has @xmath77 27@xmath78 m pixels . with the @xmath79arcsec entrance slit ,",
    "the spectrograph delivers a resolution @xmath80  ( 185 km  s@xmath31 at 10355 ) , sampled with 2.1 pixels . typically , we exposed on an object for 900s before reading out the detector , moving the target by a few arcseconds along the slit , and starting the subsequent exposure .",
    "total integration times ranged between 5400 and 18000s ( see column ( 7 ) of table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "all of the qso observed were sufficiently bright at near - ir wavelengths to be visible on the slit , thereby facilitating guiding .",
    "the nirspec two - dimensional ( 2-d ) spectra were processed with a suite of purpose - designed idl routines kindly provided by dr .",
    "g. becker .",
    "as described in more detail by becker , rauch , & sargent ( 2009 ) , this software does a very good job at subtracting the dark current , removing detector defects , flat - fielding , and particularly removing the sky background ( achieved by employing the optimal sky subtraction techniques of kelson 2003 ) which can be the limiting factor to the s / n achievable at near - ir wavelengths . optimal extraction ( horne 1986 ) is also used to trace the qso signal in the processed 2-d images and output a vacuum - heliocentric wavelength calibrated one - dimensional ( 1-d ) source spectrum and associated error .",
    "the wavelength calibration uses the oh sky emission lines superposed on the qso spectrum , with the wavelengths tabulated in the atlas by rousselot et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "as we have many ( @xmath81 ) individual 900s spectra ( and associated error ) of each of our qsos , we combined them using a weighted mean algorithm that operates on a pixel - by - pixel basis and rejects outliers beyond a specified number of standard deviations from the mean ( usually @xmath82 ) .",
    "the spectra were finally normalised by dividing by a spline fit to the underlying qso continuum .",
    "the rms deviation of the data from this continuum ( away from obvious spectral features ) provides an empirical estimate of the final s / n achieved .",
    "we found this empirical estimate of the s / n to be lower , by factors between 2.0 and 1.1 , than the pixel - to - pixel error on the weighted mean calculated when co - adding the individual exposures , as described above .",
    "this difference presumably reflects the residual importance of systematic ( rather than random ) errors ; in any case , the values listed in the penultimate column of table  [ tab : obs ] are those measured from the residuals about the continuum fit .",
    "since the s / n varies along each spectrum , we give in the table the maximum and minimum values which apply to the wavelength region searched for absorption lines ( listed for each qso in column ( 5 ) of table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "the isaac spectra were obtained with a mixture of service - mode and visitor - mode observations we used the instrument in its medium resolution mode with a 0.6arcsec wide slit , which results in a spectral resolution @xmath83  ( 53 km  s@xmath31 ) , sampled with four pixels of the @xmath77 hawaii rockwell array . with this set - up",
    ", the wavelength range spanned is @xmath84  ; we normally chose a grating setting which placed the civ emission line at the red limit of the range covered . in some cases ,",
    "multiple wavelength settings were used , to increase the pathlength for absorption covered ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "the observations were conducted in the conventional ` beam - switching ' mode , in a series of @xmath85s exposures at two locations on the detector , typically separated by 10arcsec .",
    "after each cycle of four integrations , the object was moved along the slit to a new pair of positions . the instrument was aligned on the sky at an angle chosen to include on the slit a bright star which provides a useful pointing and seeing reference .",
    "the reduction of the isaac data used mainly iraf tasks following the steps already described by ryan - weber et al .",
    "briefly , we started from the eso pipeline products which are 2-d images that have undergone a substantial amount of pre - processing , including flat - fielding , background subtraction , and wavelength calibration .",
    "given the weakness of the sources at the moderately high dispersion of the isaac spectra , we found it most effective to combine all the processed frames of a given qso ( at a given wavelength setting ) in 2-d , after appropriate shifts to bring them into alignment .",
    "this co - addition also allowed us to reject deviant pixels .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were extracted from the co - added 2-d frames , with a second pass at subtracting any residual sky features ; the data were then rebinned to two wavelength bins per resolution element in order to improve the s /",
    "n while still maintaining adequate spectral sampling .",
    "the final steps , including normalisation to the qso continuum and estimate of the rms noise , were the same as described for the nirspec spectra .",
    "as can be appreciated from inspection of table  [ tab : obs ] , the values of s / n achieved with isaac tend to be lower than those of the nirspec spectra , despite the generally longer integration times .",
    "however , the significantly higher spectral resolution provided by isaac , by a factor of @xmath7 , largely compensates for the lower s / n , so that the two sets of data reach comparable sensitivities in terms of the minimum absorption line equivalent widths detectable .",
    "the normalised spectra of the ten qsos in table  [ tab : obs ] are reproduced in figures  [ fig : spec1][fig : spec4 ] , together with the corresponding error spectra .",
    "absorption lines were identified from a visual inspection of the spectra ; they are labelled in figures  [ fig : spec1][fig : spec4 ] and tabulated in table  [ tab : ew ] .",
    "we now briefly comment on each qso spectrum in turn .",
    "this qso was identified by venemans et al .",
    "( 2007 ) from the first data release of the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) , and independently by jiang et al .",
    "( 2008 ) from the _ sloan digital sky survey _ ( sdss ) . both surveys reported similar emission redshifts : @xmath86 ( venemans et al . ) and @xmath87 ( jiang et al . ) . from our nirspec spectrum ,",
    "however , we measure the lower value @xmath88 from a broad emission feature which we presume to be civ@xmath55 ; this value is in much better agreement with the recent reassessment of the optical and infrared spectrum of this source by mortlock et al .",
    "( 2008 ) who conclude that @xmath89 .",
    "mortlock et al .",
    "point out that this is a broad absorption line ( bal ) qso which led the discoverers to misidentify the nv@xmath90 emission line as ly@xmath15 : the latter is completely absorbed by the blueshifted nv absorption trough .",
    "as this is a bal qso , we do not include it in the survey for  absorption ( as we are primarily interested in civ in the intergalactic medium , and wish to avoid contamination of our sample by metal - enriched gas which may be ejected from the qso ) . nevertheless , it is of interest to note that we do detect two narrow  doublets at redshifts @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( see figure  [ fig : spec1 ] ) ; their equivalent widths are given in table  [ tab : ew ] .",
    "relative to @xmath88 , these two absorbers have velocities @xmath93 and @xmath94 km  s@xmath31 and are thus most likely associated with the qso environment .",
    "positive velocities relative to @xmath54 by up to @xmath953000 km  s@xmath31 have been encountered before among high ionisation absorbers at lower redshifts ( e.g. fox , petitjean , & bergeron 2008 ; wild et al .",

    "the rise in  we see in figure  [ fig : o_civb ] could result either from an increase in the amount of intergalactic carbon , or from changes in the ionisation balance favouring the fraction of carbon which is triply ionised , or both .",

    "opinions are still divided , however , as to the correct interpretation of the ly@xmath15  forest evolution at these high redshifts ( e.g. becker , rauch , & sargent 2007 and references therein ) .",
    "coupled with the rise in the comoving density of bright qsos ( fan 2006 ) , a higher igm transmission would quickly ionise a larger fraction of carbon into .    to make progress beyond these qualitative remarks ,",

    "their latest models ( oppenheimer , dav , & finlator 2009 ) do indeed entertain a marked growth in  from @xmath243 to 5 , driven by _ both _ effects mentioned above . in their scenario , the overall density of carbon increases by a factor of @xmath244 between @xmath13 and 4.7 .",
    "the accompanying rise in  depends on the spectral shape of the radiation field which dominates the ionisation equilibrium .",
    "oppenheimer et al .",
    "( 2009 ) consider two possibilities : the metagalactic background in the formulation by haardt & madau ( 1996 ) with recent updates , and a more local field dominated by early - type stars in the nearest galaxy to the  absorbers , in recognition of the fact that cosmic reionisation was likely to be very patchy at these early epochs .",
    "the former produces the larger change in  ( for the reasons explained above ) , which grows by a factor of @xmath245 between @xmath13 and 4.7 ; the latter results in a more modest rise , by a factor of @xmath246 .",

    "two ingredients of the simulations by oppenheimer et al .",
    "( 2009 ) need to be clarified , however .",
    "the first , and more important one , is that in their scenario the galaxies responsible for most of the igm enrichment are of low mass and with luminosities well _ below _ the current observational limit @xmath236 .",
    "we know very little , if anything at all , about the galaxies at the faint end of the luminosity function at @xmath0 , and this situation is unlikely to be remedied until the launch of the james webb space telescope in the next decade .",
    "a second concern is the resonant opacity of the igm at the frequencies of the heii lyman series which has been neglected until recently , and which may affect the distribution of carbon among its highly ionised states ( madau & haardt 2009 ) .",
    "the average metallicity of the igm at a given epoch reflects the accumulation of the heavy elements synthesised by previous generations of stars and expelled from their host galaxies .",
    "the massive stars which explode as typeii supernovae and seed the igm with metals are also the sources of nearly all of the lyman continuum photons produced by a burst of star formation .",
    "consequently , it is relatively straightforward to link a given igm metallicity with a minimum number of lyc photons which must have been produced up until that time .",
    "the close correspondence between the sources metals and photons makes the conversion from one to the other largely independent of the details of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "for example , madau & shull ( 1996 ) calculate that changing the index of a power - law formulation of the imf , such as salpeter s ( 1955 ) , from @xmath247 to 3 , results in only a 10% difference in the conversion between metallicity and number of lyc photons emitted .    when in the past this line of reasoning has been applied to measures of the igm metallicity at @xmath248 ( e.g. madau & shull 1996 ;",
    "miralda - escude & rees 1997 ) , it has been concluded that the star formation activity prior to that epoch probably produced sufficient photons to reionise the universe . with our new estimate of ,",
    "much closer in time to what may have been the end of the process of reionisation , we are able to revisit this question more critically .",
    "we begin by calculating the igm metallicity by mass , @xmath249 , implied by our measure of : @xmath250 where @xmath251 ( pettini et al .",
    "2008a ) is the contribution of baryons to the critical density , @xmath252 is the fraction of carbon which is triply ionised , and @xmath253 is the mass fraction of metals in carbon . for comparison , in the sun ,",

    "2008b ; fabbian et al .",
    "2009 ) ; and ( b ) any departures are in any case likely to result in only a small correction compared to other uncertainties in the following discussion .",
    "we also adopt the conservative limit @xmath257 , as done by songaila ( 2001 ) ; this is the maximum fractional abundance reached by civ under the most favourable ionisation balance conditions . with these parameters",
    ", our measured @xmath258 implies @xmath259    in recent years , much theoretical attention has been directed to estimating the likely properties of metal - poor early - type stars . schaerer ( 2002 )",
    "pointed out that stellar luminosities at far - uv wavelengths are higher at lower metallicities , leading to a greater output of lyc photons associated with stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "specifically , the energy emitted in hydrogen ionising photons ( per baryon ) is related to the average cosmic metallicity by : @xmath260 where @xmath261mev is the rest mass of the proton and @xmath262 is the stellar efficiency conversion factor .",
    "schaerer ( 2002 ) estimated @xmath263 for stars with @xmath264 , a factor of @xmath265 higher than at solar metallicities ( see also venkatesan & truran 2003 ) . for an average energy of 21ev per lyc photon ( schaerer 2002 )",
    ", our determination of @xmath266 then implies that less than one ( @xmath267 ) lyc photon per baryon was emitted by early - type stars prior to @xmath13 .",
    "this background is clearly insufficient to keep the universe ionised .",
    "when we take into account that : ( a ) an unknown fraction , @xmath268 , of the emitted lyc photons will escape from the regions of star formation into intergalactic space , and ( b ) more than one intergalactic lyc photon per baryon is likely to be required to keep the clumpy igm ionised against radiative recombinations ( e.g. madau , haardt , & rees 1999 ; bolton & haehnelt 2007 ) , we reach the conclusion that our shortfall is by at least one order of magnitude .",
    "there are a number of possible solutions to this problem .",

    "( 2009 ) runs counter to this explanation .",
    "second , if @xmath270 , some of the tension would be relieved .",
    "for example , in the models considered by oppenheimer et al .",
    "( 2009 ) most of the c is doubly - ionised at @xmath376 , and @xmath271 , a factor of five lower than the upper limit assumed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : z_igm2 ] ) . on the other hand , there are limits to the extent to which the shortfall can be explained by ionisation effects alone .",
    "if the igm is not highly ionised at these redshifts , so that @xmath270 , we would also expect a non - negligible fraction of c to be singly ionised . unlike ciii , which is virtually impossible to observe at these redshifts because its resonance lines are either too weak or buried in the ly@xmath15 forest , cii has a well - placed strong transition at rest wavelength @xmath272which should provide , in conjunction with @xmath27(civ ) , some indication of the ionisation balance of c. for two of the civ absorbers in the present sample , at @xmath39 and 5.8288 in line to sdssj103027.01 + 052455.0 ( table  [ tab : abs ] ) , the corresponding cii@xmath273 lines are covered by the esi spectrum of pettini et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in neither case",
    "is cii absorption detected ; the corresponding upper limits are @xmath27(cii)/@xmath27(civ)@xmath274 at @xmath39 and @xmath27(cii)/@xmath27(civ)@xmath275 at @xmath276 .",
    "clearly these are high - ionisation absorbers for which it seems unlikely that civ is only a trace ion stage of carbon . in future",
    ", it will be possible to quantify better the ionisation state of the metal - bearing igm at these redshifts with observations targeted at other elements , such as si which may be observable in three ion stages : siii , siiii , and siiv .",
    "returning to @xmath249 , another reason why the value in eq .",
    "( [ eq : z_igm2 ] ) may underestimate the cosmic mean metallicity is that it does not include carbon in stars .",
    "the ensuing upward correction however , is unlikely to be more than a factor of @xmath244 , unless current estimates ( e.g. bouwens et al .",
    "2008 ) still miss a significant fraction of the cosmic star formation activity prior to @xmath13 as argued , for example , by faucher - gigure et al .",
    "it is also intriguing to note that schaerer ( 2002 ) proposed an efficiency factor as high as @xmath277 ( nearly five times higher than the value used here in eq .",
    "[ eq : e_z ] ) for metal - free stars .",
    "additionally , the number of lyc photons in the igm may be boosted by a population of faint qsos yet to be detected .",
    "possibly , all of these factors contribute and , given all the unknowns , one may argue that this kind of accounting exercise is premature",
    ". future work , aimed at improving the statistics of  absorption at high redshifts and at identifying the galaxies from which these metals may have originated , will undoubtedly place the above speculations on much firmer observational ground .",
    "we have conducted the largest survey to date for intergalactic metals at redshifts @xmath278 .",
    "our sample consists of near - ir spectra of nine high - redshift qsos covering a total absorption distance @xmath42 , seven times greater than the pilot observations by ryan - weber et al .",
    "our main results can be summarised as follows :    \\1 .",
    "we detect three definite and one possible  doublets ; the three definite cases all correspond to column densities of triply ionised carbon in excess of @xmath279@xmath109 .",
    "we detect two further  doublets in a tenth qso which is not included in the final sample as it shows evidence for mass ejection ( a bal qso ) ; in any case these two systems are probably associated with the qso environment rather than being truly intergalactic .    \\2 . from the three definite detections ,",
    "we deduce a comoving mass density @xmath6 at a mean @xmath5 .",
    "this value represents a drop in @xmath11 by a factor of @xmath7 compared to @xmath280 at the @xmath211 significance level , after the different levels of completeness of optical and near - ir surveys are taken into account .",
    "if the column density distribution of  absorbers remained invariant at @xmath49 in its shape and normalisation as determined at @xmath222 , we would have expected to find @xmath221  doublets in our data , instead of only three , adding to the evidence for a decrease in the frequency of intergalactic  as we approach @xmath234",
    "thus our data suggest a relatively rapid build - up of intergalactic  over a period of only @xmath9myr , from @xmath281 to @xmath282gyr after the big bang . such a build - up could reflect the earlier rise of cosmic star formation activity from @xmath10 indicated by galaxy counts and/or an increasing level of ionisation in the igm .",
    "numerical simulations of galaxy formation which include momentum - driven galactic outflows are consistent with our findings and suggest that both factors  a genuine build - up of metallicity and higher ionisation  contribute to the rise in  from @xmath13 to @xmath283 .",
    "_ if _ the value of  we have derived is representative of the igm at large , it corresponds to a metallicity @xmath284 .",
    "the accumulation of this mass of metals in the igm in turn implies that only about one lyman continuum photon per baryon had been emitted by early - type stars prior to @xmath13 .",
    "this background is clearly insufficient to keep the the universe ionised , suggesting that more carbon is present at these early epochs , in undetected ionisation stages , low column density systems , stars , or a combination of all three .",
    "all of these estimates are of necessity still rather uncertain . however , with the forthcoming availability of x - shooter on the vlt , as well as planned improvements in the performance of near - ir spectrographs on other large telescopes , it should be possible in the near future to make full use of metal absorption lines in qso spectra to trace early star formation and the consequent reionisation of the igm .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge the expert assistance with the observations offered by rachel gilmour at eso , grant hill at keck , and brad holden at santa cruz .",
    "we are indebted to george becker who generously provided the efficient data reduction software used in the analysis of the nirspec spectra , and to alice shapley who very kindly helped with its implementation and use in cambridge .",
