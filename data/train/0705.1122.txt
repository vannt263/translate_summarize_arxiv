    "the study of the balance function ( bf ) is motivated by the prediction that its width may be sensitive to the creation of a deconfined phase in the early stage of central nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "the method is based on the observation that hadrons are produced locally in pairs of oppositely charged particle .",
    "particles of such a pair are separated in rapidity ( y ) due to the initial momentum difference and secondary interactions with other particles .",
    "particles of a pair that were created earlier are separated further in rapidity because of the expected large initial momentum difference and the long lasting rescattering phase . on the other hand ,",
    "oppositely charged particles of a pair that were created later are correlated over a smaller interval @xmath29 in rapidity .    as in previous publications from the na49 experiment on the bf @xcite ,",
    "the analysis is performed for all charged particles ( predominantly pions ) in order to avoid the additional complications from the identification procedure .",
    "consequently the pseudo - rapidity ( @xmath30 ) of charged particles is examined and the bf is defined as @xcite :    @xmath31 . \\label{bf_def2}\\ ] ]    the width of the bf can be characterized by the weighted average @xmath32 :    @xmath33    where _ i _ is the bin number of the bf histogram .",
    "it was suggested that the creation of a deconfined phase of quarks and gluons ( the qgp ) in the early stages of nucleus - nucleus collisions , would lead to delayed hadronization , i.e. a narrowing of the bf @xcite .",
    "indeed , results on the bf obtained for au+au collisions at rhic @xcite and pb+pb interactions at the top sps energy @xcite observed this narrowing for central collisions in the mid - rapidity domain . in this paper , the study of the bf is extended to the forward rapidity region .",
    "in addition , the energy dependence of the width of the bf for central pb+pb collisions is investigated at lower sps energies where indications for the onset of deconfinement had been obtained @xcite .    in the following two sections we will first describe in brief the na49 experimental setup and the data analysis .",
    "the next two sections will be dedicated to the new experimental results on the rapidity and the energy dependence of the width of the bf .",
    "we will conclude with a section on model comparisons and the summary .",
    "the na49 detector @xcite is a wide acceptance hadron spectrometer for the study of hadron production in collisions of hadrons or heavy ions at the cern sps .",
    "the main components are four large - volume time projection chambers ( tpcs ) which are capable of detecting 80% of some 1500 charged particles created in a central pb+pb collision at 158__a _ _ gev .",
    "the targets are c ( 561 mg / cm@xmath9 ) , si ( 1170 mg / cm@xmath9 ) disks and a pb ( 224 mg / cm@xmath9 ) foil for ion collisions and a liquid hydrogen cylinder ( length 20 cm ) for hadron interactions .",
    "they are positioned about 80 cm upstream from vtpc-1 .",
    "the centrality of a collision is selected ( on - line for central pb+pb , si+si and c+c and off - line for minimum bias pb+pb , si+si and c+c interactions ) by a trigger using information from a downstream calorimeter ( vcal ) , which measures the energy @xmath35 of the projectile spectator nucleons .",

    "these data samples passed once again through the shuffling mechanism to provide an estimate of the highest value of the width for each energy under the constraint of global charge conservation .",
    "the pseudo - rapidity interval analyzed was limited to a range of 1.4 units and was located around mid - rapidity ( table [ intervals ] ) . in order to compare the decrease of the width for the different energies , we introduced the normalized parameter _",

    "the second , is also based on string excitation with the addition of interactions between the produced particles after the hadronization ( rescattering ) .",

    "when the interactions of the partons cease , they are recombined with their parent strings to form hadrons according to the lund fragmentation mechanism @xcite .",

    "figure [ model_comparison ] , in which the measured width @xmath32 of the bf for charged particles at @xmath42 gev is plotted as a function of the mean number of wounded nucleons @xmath47 , shows the main results of our comparison . the clear centrality dependence of the order of @xmath48 seen for experimental data , can not be described by the microscopic models hijing and urqmd .",
    "results from both models suggest no centrality dependence of the bf width . on the other hand ,",
    "the ampt model , which incorporates the time evolution of partons before their hadronization , is predicting a centrality dependence of the bf similar to what is seen in the data .",

    "in this paper , we have presented new results on the bf obtained by the na49 collaboration .",
    "we have analyzed data from different colliding systems and centrality classes for two different energies in two different rapidity regions . at mid - rapidity",
    "the experimental data reveal an interesting decrease of the bf width with increasing centrality of the collision for both energies .",
    "this effect can not be reproduced either by the urqmd model or by the shuffling mechanism . in the forward rapidity region , on the other hand , no centrality dependence of the bf width is observed .    the results from the energy scan show an indication for an energy dependence which is not apparent in the urqmd model .",
    "the narrowing of the balance function , expressed by the normalised width parameter _ w _",
    ", increases from the lowest sps energy to the highest sps and rhic energies . again",
    "this rise is limited to the mid - rapidity regions .",
    "finally , the comparison with different microscopic models , showed that the narrowing of the bf s width with centrality can only be reproduced by models that contain a quark - parton evolution phase before hadronization .",
