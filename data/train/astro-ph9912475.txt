    "a significant fraction of bursts appear to have low energy spectral slopes steeper than 1/3 in energy@xcite . this has motivated consideration of a thermal or nonthermal@xcite comptonization mechanism , while leaving the astrophysical model largely unspecified .",
    "there is also evidence that the apparent clustering of the break energy of grb spectra in the 50 - 500 kev range may not be due to observational selection @xcite .",
    "models using compton attenuation @xcite require reprocessing by an external medium whose column density adjusts itself to a few g @xmath0 .",
    "more recently a preferred break has been attributed to a blackbody peak at the comoving pair recombination temperature in the fireball photosphere @xcite . in order for such photospheres to occur at the pair recombination temperature in the accelerating regime",
    "requires an extremely low baryon load . for very large baryon loads ,",
    "a different explanation has been invoked @xcite involving scattering of photospheric photons off mhd waves in the photosphere , which upscatters the adiabatically cooled photons up to the observed break energy .    motivated by the above observations , these ideas have been synthesized @xcite to produce a generic scenario in which the presence of a photospheric component as well as shocks subject to pair breakdown can produce steep low energy spectra and preferred breaks ( see figure [ fig : photsp ] ) .    in some of our previous work @xcite considering photospheres and pair formation , their thermal character , the uncompensated photosphere redshift in the coasting phase , and",
    "the requirement of a power law extending to gev energies were arguments in favor of a synchrotron and inverse compton mechanism in shocks .",
    "the latter should , indeed , play a significant role in any model .",
    "however , a photosphere is always present , even if not always dominant .",
    "if the photosphere occurs in the accelerating regime where @xmath1 , its energy is comparable to that of shocks which may occur further out , and the energy at which the black - body peak ( t ) is observed is in the  magic \" range near 0.5 mev , for @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the terminal bulk lorentz factor and @xmath4 .",
    "both its peak energy and its total energy are lower if the photosphere occurs in the coasting phase ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "a steep low energy spectral slope is provided by the rayleigh - jeans part of the photosphere , and a low - energy excess or terrace by its wien part . a high energy power law extending above this up to gev requires , however , a separate explanation .",
    "one possibility is up - scattering of photospheric photons in the @xmath6 region by alfvn waves , whose energy may be a fraction of the bulk kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "this leads to a comptonized broken power law spectrum ( phc ) in @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) of slope 1 up to the  magic \" break energy @xmath9 , and slope 0 up to @xmath10 above that ( fig .",
    "[ fig : photsp ] ) .",
    "the energy in this phc wave - comptonized component can be substantial relative to the photosphere , and equals the ratio of wave to bulk kinetic energy .    above the photosphere",
    ", internal shocks are expected to occur @xcite , which would lead to a nonthermal synchrotron / ic spectrum ( s ) additional to the above . however ,",
    "if the compactness parameter @xmath11 ( or comoving luminosity ) is high , pair formation occurs which could produce a self - regulated low pair ( comoving ) temperature @xmath12 favoring comptonization @xcite . in this @xmath13 case ,",
    "thermal comptonization on the subrelativistic electrons leads to another comptonized component ( c ) of slope 1 up to an observer - frame energy @xmath14 . above this , if scattering off waves also occurs in the shocks , a second component of slope 0 would extend above it to @xmath15 .",
    "the environment in which a grb occurs may also lead , in the afterglow phase , to specific spectral signatures from the external medium imprinted in the continuum , such as atomic edges and lines @xcite .",
    "these may be used both to diagnose the chemical abundances and the ionization state ( or local separation from the burst ) , as well as serving as potential alternative redshift indicators .",
    "( in addition , the outflowing ejecta itself may also contribute blue - shifted edge and line features , especially if metal - rich blobs or filaments are entrained in the flow from the disrupted progenitor debris @xcite , which could serve as diagnostic for the progenitor composition and outflow lorentz factor ) .",
    "an interesting prediction @xcite is that an fe k-@xmath16 x - ray _ emission _ line could be a diagnostic of a hypernova , since in this case one may expect a      massive envelope at a radius comparable to a light - day where @xmath17 , capable of reprocessing the x - ray continuum by recombination and fluorescence ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "detailed radiative transfer calculations have been performed to simulate the time - dependent x / uv line spectra of massive progenitor ( hypernova ) remnants@xcite , see figure [ fig : funsp ] .",
    "two types of hypernova environment geometries were considered , which are illuminated by a typical time - dependent broken power law afterglow continuum spectrum .",
    "one model consists of a dense shell , such as a supernova remnant , which could be the product of an inhomogeneous wind of variable velocity .",
    "this is essentially a transmission model , and produces initially an absorption x - ray line spectrum , turning later into an emmision spectrum , in which for fe abundances 10 or 100 times solar the fe line luminosities are @xmath18 erg s@xmath19 .",
    "the other model assumes a funnel geometry and is essentially a reflection model , with an empty or low density region along an axis , such as would arise in a rotating stellar envelope or a wind .",
    "the fireball and the afterglow propagate inside this funnel , which acts as a channel that collimates and reflects the continuum .",
    "this results in an emission line spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : funsp ] ) , where for 10 or 100 times solar abundances the fe k-@xmath16 line luminosity reaches @xmath20 erg s@xmath19 , with line and edge equivalent widths @xmath21 kev .",
    "this is comparable to the @xmath22 fe features reported by two groups @xcite in grb 970508 and grb 970828 .",
    "it is interesting that the fe k - edge is significant in a funnel model such as shown fig [ fig : funsp ] . while the energy of an fe line 6.7 kev feature in grb 970508 agrees with its previously known redshift @xmath23",
    ", the line feature of grb 970828 would be in agreement with the 9.28 kev fe k - edge energy at this object s newly reported @xcite redshift of @xmath24 .",
    "the line features in the 30 - 40 ev source - frame range seen in figure [ fig : funsp ] would be redshifted into the optical for @xmath25 , but are likely to be blanketed by the ly-@xmath16 forest of intervening high redshift galaxies . however , it may be possible to detect the soft x - ray metallic lines which become prominent soon after the fe features , as the continuum softens and the gas cools , e.g. s and si in the 2 - 3 kev source - frame range , or @xmath26 kev at @xmath27 .",
