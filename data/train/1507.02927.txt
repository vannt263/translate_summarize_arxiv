    "<S> mechanical properties are of central importance to materials sciences , in particular if they depend on external stimuli . here </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the rheological response of amorphous solids , namely colloidal glasses , to external forces . </S>",
    "<S> using confocal microscopy and computer simulations , we establish a quantitative link between the macroscopic creep response and the microscopic single - particle dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we observe dynamical heterogeneities , namely regions of enhanced mobility , which remain localized in the creep regime , but grow for applied stresses leading to steady flow . </S>",
    "<S> these different behaviors are also reflected in the _ average _ particle dynamics , quantified by the mean squared displacement of the individual particles , and the fraction of active regions . </S>",
    "<S> both microscopic quantities are found to be proportional to the macroscopic strain , despite the non - equilibrium and non - linear conditions during creep and the transient regime prior to steady flow .    </S>",
    "<S> the properties of materials not only depend on their chemical composition , but also on the arrangement and dynamics of their constituents . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus crucial to understand the link between the macroscopic behaviour and the microscopic single - particle level . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between an applied mechanical force and microscopic processes is understood for crystalline , i.e.  ordered , materials . </S>",
    "<S> crystalline solids ( like metals , ceramics or minerals ) irreversibly deform when subjected to a load which is small enough to avoid fracture , although this response is very slow . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of response is called creep and originates from the presence of defects in the otherwise ordered arrangement of atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the diffusion of vacancies and dislocations is responsible for the observed plastic deformation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the same relation and microscopic processes can not occur in amorphous , i.e.  disordered , materials .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , in amorphous solid - like materials , a similar _ macroscopic _ creep response is observed under application of shear stresses below the yield stress @xmath0 , i.e.  below the transition from an elastic to a plastic response . the macroscopic creep response </S>",
    "<S> has been intensively studied in metallic , polymeric and colloidal glasses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several models @xcite successfully describe the time evolution of the strain measured during creep , namely its characteristic sub - linear time dependence . </S>",
    "<S> however , the relation of the creep response to the microscopic structure and dynamics has hardly been determined and is not well understood . due to the disordered structure of amorphous solids </S>",
    "<S> the concept of defects is not applicable and a microscopic mechanism different from the one in crystalline solids must be responsible for creep . </S>",
    "<S> thus , to make progress , microscopic observations on a single - particle level during creep tests are required . </S>",
    "<S> combining experiments and simulations , we investigated colloidal glasses when constant stress is suddenly applied , i.e.  during creep tests . </S>",
    "<S> we reveal a quantitative link between the macroscopic rheological response and the microscopic dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this is possible due to recent developments in simultaneously performing rheology and confocal microscopy @xcite . during creep flow near the yielding threshold </S>",
    "<S> , we observe that very few particles undergo large non - affine displacements which leads to pronounced , but spatially localized , dynamical heterogeneities and sub - diffusive dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for stresses beyond the yield stress , transient super - diffusive dynamics mark the onset of steady flow . at the same time , growing domains of enhanced dynamic activity are present , with their number correlating with the macroscopic strain . </S>",
    "<S> this is reflected in a correlation between the macroscopic strain and the single particle displacements . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the steady - state flow regime , this correlation also holds in the creep and transient states , specially for stresses near the yield stress . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we can quantitatively relate the macroscopic rheological response of soft glasses to the average and heterogeneous microscopic dynamics which are spatially localized during creep but span the entire system at large stresses that lead to flow . </S>",
    "<S> the different microscopic behavior thus reflects the different macroscopic response during creep and flow , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this extends previous observations to non - linear and non - equilibrium situations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , as we observe the same behavior for different systems , realized in the experiments and simulations , this appears to be a general feature of glasses . </S>"
