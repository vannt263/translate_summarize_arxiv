    "impurity models constitute an important chapter in modern condensed matter physics . since the original paper by kondo  @xcite considering electron sea screening a single impurity spin , this problem has attracted significant theoretical and experimental attention .",
    "@xcite more recently , impurity physics has been studied in the context of strongly interacting systems .",
    "numerous examples include  @xcite an impurity in systems with vanishing density of states  @xcite high temperature superconductors ,  @xcite and quantum magnets .",
    "@xcite quantum magnets are particularly versatile as a host system , having a large number of possible ground states with different low energy excitations .",
    "in this paper we consider a spin - half impurity embedded in a spin-1 quantum paramagnet with a spin liquid ground state .",
    "we consider the situation where the low energy excitations of the paramagnet are described by emergent fermionic excitations with a fermi surface , coupled to a @xmath2 gauge field .",
    "this study is motivated by the recent appearance of several @xmath1 spin liquid candidate materials .",
    "@xcite theoretically , a number of spin liquid ground states for spin-1 system have been proposed .",
    "@xcite one possible scenario involves emergence of three fermionic excitations carrying spin-1 quantum numbers .",
    "@xcite assuming that fermi surfaces of these excitations are not destroyed by a pairing instability , we obtain the host system that is considered below .",
    "impurity physics in a spin-@xmath4 spin liquids has been considered in the context of bosonic spin liquids ,  @xcite algebraic spin liquids ,  @xcite and spin liquids with a fermi surface .",
    "@xcite in particular , ribeiro and one of us in ref .   concluded that physics of a spin-@xmath4 impurity embedded in a spin liquid with @xmath5 fermionic excitations is similar to that of the conventional kondo problem .",
    "@xcite in what follows we argue that a spin-@xmath4 impurity in a @xmath1 spin liquid with a fermi surface realizes overscreened kondo physics . although our results are qualitatively similar to the overscreened kondo effect in conventional systems , there are observable differences due to the presence of an emergent gauge field coupled to spinons .",
    "our findings suggest that an impurity in a @xmath1 spin liquid can be used to probe fermionic excitations .",
    "as these excitations do not carry charge , their experimental detection is a difficult problem .",
    "different experimental probes have been suggested in the context of spin-@xmath4 spin liquids .",
    "@xcite we suggest that the realization of overscreened kondo physics is a possible way to unravel physics of spin - one spin liquid , allowing probes of fermionic excitations , as well as the presence of an emergent gauge field .",
    "overscreened kondo physics is realized in multichannel kondo models , where a single spin is coupled to @xmath3 copies ( flavors ) of itinerant electrons .",
    "@xcite on the one hand , such a generalization of original kondo model may be seen as merely a theoretical tool , allowing a perturbative expansion in @xmath6 . on the other hand , the physics changes drastically depending on the interrelation between impurity spin length , @xmath7 , and the number of flavors coupled to the impurity .",
    "when the number of flavors , @xmath3 , is just enough or less than needed to screen the impurity spin , @xmath8 , antiferromagnetic coupling between the impurity and electrons flows to infinity in the infrared , meaning that at low temperatures impurity spin is screened to the maximum possible extent by electrons , resulting in fermi - liquid behavior .",
    "@xcite however , in the overscreened regime , @xmath9 , i.e. when there are more channels than required to screen the impurity spin , the system has a non - fermi - liquid fixed point .",
    "@xcite this state is characterized by singularities in different physical observables , such as impurity spin susceptibility , specific heat , _ etc . _",
    "it is particularly interesting as a solvable example of a system with a non - fermi - liquid fixed point .",
    "@xcite despite the rich and interesting physics , the overscreened regime of kondo model has only few realizations  ( in particular quantum dots and two levels systems .",
    "hence our system is also interesting as a possible implementation of overscreened kondo physics .",
    "qualitatively , the problem of a spin - half impurity hosted by isotropic @xmath1 spin liquid looks similar to the conventional overscreened kondo impurity model . when coupled antiferromagneticaly , itinerant excitations carrying spin-1 quantum numbers can not screen the impurity .",
    "however , the presence of a gauge field effectively enforcing a single occupancy constraint for fermionic excitations , makes these two problems different . even without the impurity ,",
    "fermions are in a non - fermi - liquid regime  @xcite due to the gauge field .",
    "the fermion propagator is dressed by a singular self - energy , so there are no well defined quasiparticle excitations in the system .",
    "this is manifested , for example , in the singular behavior of the specific heat @xmath10 in two dimensions at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite    coupling the impurity to fermions with non - fermi - liquid behavior allows us to study the interplay between the gauge field induced non - fermi - liquid behavior and the kondo non - fermi - liquid fixed point .",
    "the conventional approach to the kondo problem is either an exact solution by mapping it onto one - dimensional problem ,  @xcite or @xmath6 expansion .",
    "both methods are not directly applicable in our case .",
    "the presence of gauge field impedes the mapping of our model to a one dimensional problem in the radial channel . on the other hand ,",
    "a rigorous @xmath6 expansion is not possible , due to singular self - energy corrections  @xcite .",
    "the latter issue has been recently resolved in the paper by mross  _ et .",
    "al . _ ,  @xcite where a controlled double expansion scheme has been provided .",
    "it combines the @xmath6 expansion with an expansion in another small parameter ( related to the dynamical critical exponent of the gauge field ) .",
    "we adopt the recently developed double expansion method  @xcite to our problem .",
    "since the double expansion includes the large @xmath3 limit , we expect to have a perturbatively accessible fixed point . at leading order",
    ", the gauge field does not affect the position of this non - fermi - liquid kondo fixed point .",
    "however , it leads to corrections to the scaling dimension of the kondo coupling .",
    "assuming that the results obtained using the double expansion interpolate to the physical case , we conclude that physical properties such as impurity spin susceptibility , specific heat , etc . are still characterized by singular behavior .",
    "unlike the case of the kondo model in the regime of perfect screening ,  @xcite where the coupling to the gauge field has no consequences to leading order in @xmath6 , in our case the gauge field influences kondo physics .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the remainder of this section",
    ", we introduce the basics of our model , diagram technique and briefly explain the idea behind double expansion . in section  [ sec : fixedpoint ] we first review known results for the @xmath11-function in the overscreened kondo problem without the gauge field .",
    "afterwards , we calculate the @xmath11-function with the gauge field and study the changes in scaling behavior of different physical quantities . finally , in section  [",
    "sec : discussion ] we discuss the extrapolation of our findings beyond the double expansion , and comment on possible experimental realizations and experiments to detect kondo physics .",
    "details regarding the calculation of corrections to the @xmath11-function due to gauge field are given in the appendix .",

    "we do not specify the lattice , since only an effective low energy description of a spin liquid phase is relevant in what follows .",
    "however we note that recent work  @xcite shows evidence for the possibility of stabilizing such a phase on a triangular lattice with nearest neighbors bilinear , and biquadratic spin interactions along with ring exchange terms . in the large-@xmath13 limit of a half - filled hubbard model one",
    "can easily derive the coupling between a given lattice spin at site @xmath14 and an impurity spin in a form @xmath15 this procedure leads to @xmath16 corresponding to antiferromagnetic coupling .",
    "we assume that hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hspin ] ) has a spin liquid ground state with fermionic excitations and a fermi surface .",
    "the low energy description of such a state is a theory of fermions strongly coupled to a @xmath2 gauge field .",

    "fermionic @xmath17 are the low energy excitations of the spin liquid , carrying spin-1 quantum numbers . in addition , the low energy description contains a @xmath2 gauge field , coupled to fermions @xmath22 and enforces the single occupancy constraint .    before proceeding further ,",
    "let us reiterate the question of interest .",
    "we want to understand if the non - fermi - liquid fixed point of a conventional overscreened kondo model is changed by the presence of the gauge field in the bulk .",
    "the model outlined above provides us with a particular setup to study the influence of the non - fermi - liquid bulk on the overscreened kondo fixed point . however , in order to have control over calculations we need to resort to the large-@xmath3 limit .",
    "the crucial requirement for the generalization procedure is to retain the presence of the overscreened kondo fixed point .",
    "we choose a model with @xmath3 species of _ spin - half _ fermions , @xmath23 with @xmath24 , and @xmath25 as a large-@xmath3 generalization .",
    "this is the simplest model which allows for controllable calculations .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian for our generalized model may be split into a fermionic part  ( including coupling to gauge field and impurity spin ) , and a gauge field lagrangian , @xmath26 the generalized fermion lagrangian becomes : @xmath27 where we use imaginary time . in accordance with the discussion above",
    ", fermion operators @xmath28 now carry spin-1/2 quantum numbers  ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we omit the time component of gauge field from the coupling , since it is screened ,  @xcite and do not write the diamagnetic term , including it in the gauge field propagator .",
    "the fermion spin at @xmath29 is @xmath30 with @xmath31 being the set of three pauli matrices , and @xmath32 being a number of sites in the lattice . in what follows ,",
    "greek indices label spin projection , @xmath33 , whereas latin indices @xmath34 label channels .",
    "the gauge field lagrangian is @xmath35 where the time component of the gauge field is excluded .",
    "the bare gauge field propagator is zero , since the gauge field is not dynamical but rather represents fluctuations around the mean field ansatz .",
    "however , nontrivial dynamics are generated if one accounts for coupling to fermions , leading to a non - zero @xmath36 , discussed in section  [ sec : doubleexpansion ] .      , and",
    "fermions with impurity pseudofermions , @xmath37 , are shown .",
    "all objects are diagonal in flavor indices , which are thus suppressed .",
    "[ fig : diagbasics ] ]    the impurity spin is conveniently represented via fermionic operators , @xmath38 where @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) are creation ( annihilation ) operators of spin up or down pseudofermions .",
    "@xcite in what follows we use the term `` pseudofermions '' to distinguish the operators @xmath41 from the operators @xmath42 , which describe low energy excitations in the spin liquid . a faithful representation of spin via fermion operators requires an additional constraint to exclude doubly occupied and empty states from the hilbert space .",
