    "stars ( including the sun ) exert not only gravitation , but also radiation pressure on nearby bodies . at the same time",
    ", it is well known that dust particles are characterized by a considerable sailing capacity ( cross - section to mass ratio ) , and hence are subject to a sizable effect of light pressure from the star , being one of the possible mechanisms for the formation and evolution of gas - dust clouds .    in the classical planar restricted circular three - body problem , two large masses , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , rotate in planar circular keplerian orbits , while a third particle of negligible mass moves in the same plane as the two larger bodies under their gravitational pull .",
    "however the classical model of the restricted three - body problem is not valid for studying the motion of material points in the solar system where the third mass has considerable sailing capacity ( for example cosmic dust , stellar wind , etc ) .",
    "thus it is reasonable to modify the classical model by superposing a radiative repulsion field , whose source coincides with the source of the gravitational field ( the sun ) , onto the gravitational field of the main body .",
    "this problem was called the _ photo - gravitational restricted three - body problem _ by radzievskii  @xcite . in a later work  @xcite , radzievskii performed a complete treatment of the behavior of the equilibrium points . in both papers , however , radzievskii , who was primarily interested in the solar problem , only treated a limited range of radiation pressure parameters ( in particular when only one massive body is luminous ) and did not consider the question of the linear stability of the equilibrium points .",
    "the photogravitational restricted three - body problem has been treated by several authors . in 1970",
    "chernikov  @xcite investigated the stability of the collinear equilibrium points @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , as well as the @xmath5 and @xmath6 points , and discussed the modifications of the results brought about through the poynting - robertson effect , but again only for the sun - planet problem .",
    "later , in 1985 , simmons et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the existence and linear stability of the libration points . while , in 1996 , khasan  @xcite studied librational solutions of the photogravitational restricted three body problem by considering both primaries as radiating bodies .",
    "nonlinear stability of the triangular libration points was investigated by kumar and choudhry  @xcite , who extended the work of radzievskii by analyzing the stability of the triangular points for all values of the parameters which describe the radiating effects of the primaries .",
    "they found that , except for some cases , the motion is stable for all values of the radiation reduction factors and for all values of @xmath7 .",
    "they also studied  @xcite the stability of @xmath5 and @xmath6 under the resonance conditions @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "later , godziewski et al .",
    "@xcite also studied the nonlinear stability of the triangular libration points .",
    "their study of the stability of the libration points when the resonances do not exist , and in the fourth order resonance case , shows that for some values of parameters these points are stable , and for others they are unstable . in the case when the third order resonances exist , the triangular libration points are always unstable .",
    "kunitsyn and polyakhova  @xcite gave a retrospective review of many aspects of the libration point positions and their stability for all values of radiation pressure and mass ratios .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the lyapunov stability of the triangular solutions for all possible values of the reduction coefficients given by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which represent the ratios of the difference between the gravitational force and the radiative force of the bodies of mass @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "we would like to stress here that some results presented in this paper have been obtained in the above references .",
    "the results of this paper should be viewed as a step towards describing the dynamics of the photogravitational restricted three - body problem .",
    "we note that , seen as a whole , the problem displays a number of interesting features that are not apparent in previous treatments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec2 ] contains preliminaries , where we recall the earlier results on the photogravitational planar restricted three body problem , and introduce the hamiltonian function and the equilibria of the system , along with the condition on the masses and radiation pressure values for the stability of the linearized problem .    in section  [ sec3 ] ,",
    "the study of the existence and linear stability of equilateral libration points is presented .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec - normal ] , we apply the arnold - moser theorem to examine the condition of non - linear stability , excluding the resonance cases up to the fourth order .",
    "we obtain a condition for stability in the parameter space of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 which may be expressed as a quintic in @xmath12 , plot the relevant surface , and show that this polynomial reproduces the classical result of deprit and deprit - bartholom  @xcite when @xmath13 .",
    "special cases when this polynomial reduces to a quartic ( and therefore explicit algebraic expressions for the surface may be obtained ) are determined .",
    "we consider an infinitesimal mass particle moving in the photogravitational field of two masses , termed the _ primaries _ , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with both masses in circular orbits around their common center of mass .",
    "the two primaries are sources of radiation , with the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 characterizing the radiation effect of @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively . similar to the planar classical case",
    ", the motion of the infinitesimal mass takes place in the same plane of the primaries .",
    "we should note that , in contrast to the classical restricted three - body problem , in the photogravitational problem the force acting on the particle depends not only on the parameters of the stars ( temperature , size , density , etc . ) but also on the parameters of the particle itself ( size , density , etc . )",
    "the photogravitational version of the restricted problem presented here is derived in a similar way to the classical problem ( see  @xcite ) : in fact we start from a presentation and notation very similar to that used by simmons  @xcite .",
    "units are chosen so that the unit of mass is equal to the sum of the primary masses , @xmath14 , the unit of length is equal to their separation , and the unit of time is such that the angular velocity @xmath15 .",
    "we also set the gravitational constant @xmath16 .",
    "for definiteness we also take @xmath17 , @xmath18 so that @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we have fixed the center of mass at @xmath21 and the primaries , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , at @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the forces experienced by a test particle in the coordinate system rotating with @xmath15 and origin at the center of mass are then derivable from the potential @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the coordinates of the test particle , @xmath26 are the distances from the masses @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , and @xmath27 , @xmath28 represent the effects of the radiation pressure from the two primaries .",
    "the jacobi constant of the problem is given by @xmath29 after introducing the canonical coordinate system @xmath30 @xmath31 one obtains the hamiltonian function @xmath32 in this canonical formulation the problem of determining the libration points consists of finding all real solutions of the system of four algebraic equations given by setting the hamiltonian equations of motion equal to zero , that is @xmath33 for later convenience we introduce the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 as used by schuerman  @xcite . defining @xmath36 we find that the solution of  ( [ lib - point ] ) for the coordinates of the triangular libration points @xmath5 and @xmath6 is  ( see  @xcite ) : @xmath37 this implies that @xmath38 showing that a necessary condition for the existence of triangular points is @xmath39 and @xmath40  ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , as shown by schuerman  @xcite , the points lie at the intersections of the circles defined by  ( [ rel ] ) , and so they exist provided further that @xmath41 .",
    "we remark that the existence of the equilibrium solutions is critically governed by the numerical value of @xmath42 .",
    "these points are the vertices of two triangles , of sides @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath43 , based on the line joining the primaries , and so @xmath5 and @xmath6 are known as triangular ( lagrange ) libration points .",
    "if we set @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the restricted photogravitational three body problem is reduced to the classical case .",
    "we consider here only the stability of @xmath5 , however all conclusions about the stability of @xmath5 can be extended to @xmath6 just applying the symmetries of the photogravitational problem , namely @xmath46",
    "to investigate the stability we use birkhoff s procedure  @xcite for normalizing the hamiltonian in a neighborhood of the libration point .",
    "we start the study of stability by finding the first order variational equations , which we then use to determine the eigenvalues . by the arnold - moser theorem  ( see  @xcite ) , it is known that a necessary condition for stability of the @xmath5 point is that all eigenvalues should be pure imaginary .    using a linear canonical transformation",
    ", we first shift the origin of the coordinate system to the @xmath5 point and expand the hamiltonian in a power series of the coordinates . to this end",
    "we define new coordinates @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 by @xmath51 in terms of which the equations of motion are @xmath52 in these new variables the solution ( [ lib - coor ] ) corresponds to the equilibrium state @xmath53 , for @xmath54.f we now expand the hamiltonian in a power series of the coordinates , up to fourth order . since the expansion is made in the neighborhood of an equilibrium point , the constant term ( the value of the hamiltonian at equilibrium ) can be neglected , and the linear part must vanish .",
    "the expanded hamiltonian can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 are homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath57 in the new variables . calculating this expansion to fourth order we find @xmath58 where @xmath59 , \\nonumber\\\\[3 mm ] b & \\equiv & -\\frac{3}{2}\\,\\frac{\\sqrt{b}}{\\kappa_1\\kappa_2}\\left[(1-\\mu)\\kappa_2 ^ 2 ( \\kappa_1 ^ 2 + 1 -\\kappa_2 ^ 2)+\\mu\\kappa_1 ^ 2(\\kappa_2 ^ 2 + 1 -\\kappa_1 ^ 2)\\right ] .",

    "the coefficients of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , calculated using maple , coincide with those given in kumar and choudhry  @xcite and are listed in appendix  a.    the system of linear differential equations derived from the quadratic term , @xmath62 , describes the tangent flow around @xmath5 .",
    "linear stability is determined by the character of the associated eigenvalues , which are the roots of the characteristic equation @xmath65 whose eigenvalues are found to be @xmath66 for linear stability all of these eigenvalues should be pure imaginary , which is the case if @xmath67 substituting  ( [ bdef ] ) in  ( [ eq - cond ] ) , we obtain @xmath68 since the left - hand side can be zero , we require @xmath69 as @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "this equation is satisfied for @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and so , in these subintervals , the eigenvalues  ( [ eigen ] ) are distinct and pure imaginary .    throughout this paper , we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath73 for which the linear stability conditions are fulfilled for all values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    note",
    "that lagrange s classical criterion for stability is recovered in the limit of no radiation pressure ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) . in this case",
    "the inequality  ( [ eq - cond - geral ] ) for the existence of two pairs of pure imaginary values becomes @xmath77    we remark that this result implies the stability of the @xmath5 point in the classical planar circular restricted three - body problem when the mass ratio parameter satisfies @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is known as the routh value .",
    "we write the four eigenvalues as @xmath80 , @xmath81 where the strictly positive numbers @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( _ frequencies _ ) are determined by the set of relations @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "the expressions  ( [ frec ] ) show that @xmath86 we remark that @xmath82 and @xmath83 and the coefficients of all @xmath56 are functions of the parameters @xmath12 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "having established linear stability , the next step is to transform the hamiltonian into its birkhoff normal form .",
    "this normalization allows us to apply arnold s theorem  @xcite to investigate the stability of the @xmath5 point for mass ratios @xmath87 , except for the resonant cases . from the coefficients of the normal form ,",
    "arnold s thorem constructs a determinant , @xmath88 , defined later , which , when non - zero , establishes the stability of the equilibrium point . to obtain the birkhoff normal form we use the lie series method , with the calculations",
    "being performed using maple . to determine the domain of applicability of the results , it is necessary to obtain the resonances , which we now calculate .      in this section",
    "we study the values for which the frequencies at the equilibrium are in resonance .",
    "since we are working to fourth order in the normal form , we thus need to consider resonances up to fourth order of the triangular libration points .",
    "the stability analysis of the @xmath5 point can be carried out if the frequencies @xmath82 , @xmath83 satisfy the non - resonance condition @xmath89 for all integers @xmath90 , @xmath91 such that @xmath92 .",
    "this condition is violated for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and , obviously when @xmath93 .",
    "we start the discussion by noting that the first - order resonance appears when one of the frequencies is zero . in our case , this is possible if either @xmath94 or @xmath95 . for @xmath96 the restricted photogravitational three body problem",
    "is reduced to kepler s problem in a rotating coordinate frame . the @xmath5 point in this case",
    "is evidently unstable in the sense of lyapunov .",
    "the second case has no classical equivalent : @xmath5 and @xmath6 coincide with the inner collinear point @xmath2 ( see simmons et .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular",
    "if @xmath97 and @xmath98 the libration points @xmath5 and @xmath6 move from their classical equilateral positions onto the luminous mass and coalesce there with the inner libration point @xmath2 .",
    "it is clear that the motion will be unstable .",
    "we have seen above that if @xmath99 , then @xmath100 and the triangular libration points are stable in the sense of lyapunov .",
    "this agrees with the result of meyer placin and yaguas  @xcite , who demonstrated the stability of the lagrange equilateral triangle points , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , in the plane circular restricted three - body problem when the mass ratio parameter is equal to @xmath100 , the critical value of routh .",
    "we turn to the two remaining cases .",
    "the second order resonance @xmath93 occurs when @xmath101 .",
    "since @xmath102 , the resonance appears for parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 satisfying the condition @xmath103 . in the first graph of figure  [ fig1 ] we have plotted the relevant part ( i.e. with the negative root ) of @xmath104 , together with the line @xmath105 .",
    "we see that ( other than at the exceptional value @xmath106 ) the resonant values only exist for @xmath107 .",

    "finally , the resonance @xmath9 occurs for @xmath115 .",

    "[ table1 ] we show the values of @xmath12 for @xmath120 and several values of @xmath11 for the resonances @xmath93 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "note that when one of the radiation coefficients is @xmath43 , and there is a 1:1 resonance , the points @xmath5 and @xmath6 are linearly stable with the condition that mass parameter @xmath12 is at most @xmath121 .",

    "the next step is the normalization procedure that transforms hamiltonian  ( [ ham - formal ] ) to birkhoff s normal form up to fourth order , excluding regions close to the resonances established in the previous section .    to this end , first we make a further change of variables , @xmath122 to the hamiltonian  ( [ ham2 ] ) that diagonalizes @xmath62 : @xmath123 we use a negative sign on the second term to emphasize the non - positive character of the photogravitational hamiltonian .",
    "we note that @xmath124 is already in real normal form since it depends only on the actions @xmath125 , @xmath126 . also , recall that @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the linear frequencies analyzed in the previous sections .",
    "the terms of order greater than two depend on @xmath127 , but not necessarily in such a simple way as @xmath124 .",
    "the purpose of the birkhoff normal form is to find a near identity symplectic coordinate change @xmath128 so that the even order terms in the hamiltonian depend on the new variables @xmath129 in such a way that they can be grouped as powers of @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "it is implicit in this last statement that the hamiltonian system s natural resonances have been taken into account .",
    "let @xmath132 be some system of resonance relations , _",
    "i.e. _ relations of the form @xmath133 with @xmath134 non - negative integers not all zero . from the viewpoint of the general theory of dynamical systems , equilibria and periodic trajectories in hamiltonian systems are all resonant . indeed , for equilibria , if @xmath135 is an eigenvalue of an equilibrium of a hamiltonian system , then @xmath136 is also an eigenvalue .",
    "so an infinite number of resonance relations of the form @xmath137 are satisfied .",
    "this means that we can find a non - divergent generating function ( and consequent canonical transformation ) that transforms away all terms of odd degree of the hamiltonian  ( [ ham - formal ] ) .",
    "we have , necessarily , to retain part of the even terms corresponding to the resonant monomials that appear in  ( [ ham - formal ] ) .",
    "this will become clearer in the brief presentation of the algorithm we have used to implement the birkhoff normal form .",
    "of course , a truncated birkhoff normal form is a polynomial hamiltonian that is formally integrable , since it is expressed only in terms of the actions @xmath138 , @xmath139 . for more theoretical details",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite and @xcite , and for practical implementations , the works of  @xcite and  @xcite . in this paragraph",
    "we have tried to stress a point that is usually not made clearly when calculating the birkhoff normal forms for the photogravitational problem : the difference between the natural resonances of the @xmath140 complex eigenvalues , and the resonances of the real eigenfrequencies @xmath82 and @xmath83 .    perhaps due to hamilton - jacobi tradition , some engineers and physicists , for example kumar and choudhry  @xcite , prefer to work with real variables and mixed generating functions which depend on both old and new variables . in this work we use the lie derivative approach , which allows us to use a generating function dependent only on new the variables , with the advantage of turning the cumbersome passage to the normal formal more transparent . moreover , with this approach , when the coefficients are not algebraic , but numerical , one can write fast codes to construct very high order normal forms ( see for example @xcite , @xcite ) .    before describing the algorithm and the form of the generating function , a further step is necessary to prepare the hamiltonian for the process of normalization .",
    "it is easier to perform the manipulations in the complex field and , to this end , we shall make use of the change of variables , @xmath141 , and its inverse , @xmath142 : @xmath143 where @xmath144 , to transform @xmath145 into the complex hamiltonian @xmath146 in fact , the complexification can be done directly from hamiltonian  ( [ ham2 ] ) to  ( [ hamco ] ) , as is the case in this work ( appendix  b ) .    now , we introduce the generating function @xmath147 as a series expansion in homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath148 @xmath149 and the associated canonical transformation @xmath150 , such that @xmath151 with @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the usual poisson bracket ( or lie derivative ) of the functions @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "this means that @xmath156 is the time one flow of the flux generated by the canonical system of equations associated with the generating function @xmath155 . to find the birkhoff normal form and the corresponding change of variables ( and its inverse ) one has to determine the generating function that gives the prescribed form discussed above .",
    "collecting powers of  ( [ lieseries ] ) up to order four gives @xmath157    since we are supposing that there are no resonances besides the natural ones ( as explained above ) , all terms of order 3 can be removed from  ( [ lieseries ] ) by setting @xmath158 solving for @xmath159 gives @xmath160 where @xmath161 are the coefficients of the monomials of the poisson bracket @xmath162 , which are nonzero outside the resonance regions .    for terms of order four , the solution is not so easy since @xmath163 , and we have to solve simultaneously for @xmath164 and @xmath165 , and so on , up to the required order , @xmath166 , of the normal form .",
    "in this case one can use the general result  @xcite for @xmath167 : @xmath168 and @xmath169 where @xmath170    applying these formulae we can find @xmath165 and @xmath164 , which give us the fourth order terms that the arnold - moser theorem requires .",
    "the algebraic manipulations described so far were performed using the software maple , but any algebraic software could have been used . note that @xmath165 is a complex birkhoff normal form but , using the transformation @xmath171 given in  ( [ trans - co ] )",

    "the complex canonical transformation that takes the taylor series  ( [ ham2 ] ) to  ( [ hamco ] ) is shown in appendix  b while the coefficients of the fourth order normal form are given in appendix  c. after a sequence of algebraic manipulations we finally obtain the determinant as a rational function , whose numerator is a quintic in @xmath12 .",

    "as part of this work , we noticed that , though the fourth - order taylor series expansion given by kumar and choudhry is correct , one of their results apparently does not reproduce the classical case in the appropriate limits .",
    "this motivated us to use a different approach , namely the lie triangle method , to calculate the birkhoff normal form for the hamiltonian .",
    "along the way , it was found that the conditions for the existence of resonances given by kumar and choudhry had to be slightly modified .    in this paper",
    "we give explicitly the fourth - order normal form , as well as the complex canonical transformation used to prepare the hamiltonian for the birkhoff normalization .",
