    "nanostructured photonic media , such as photonic crystals , metamaterials , and random media , are of interest their potential of achieving nanoscale control over the flow and emission of light . the wave nature of light results in a range of interference phenomena , which modify the propagation of light through complex photonic materials , in analogy with the theory of electrons in solids .",
    "interference effects lead to new correlations between optical fields at different angles and frequencies after interaction with the medium.@xcite for random or partially disordered photonic media , methods have appeared that allow for a statistical interpretation of the spectral width of the transmission and reflection correlations in terms of the distribution of dwell times of light inside the medium.@xcite the short - range frequency correlation , known as @xmath0 , which is present in the spectrum after interaction with the medium , has evolved into a broadband tool for characterizing the dynamic transport parameters of photonic nanomaterials.@xcite    here , we explore the angle - dependence of the frequency correlation both in transmission and reflection geometries .",
    "previous theoretical and experimental studies of the @xmath0 frequency correlation have not considered its dependence on scattering angle.@xcite the angle - dependence of the angular correlation function in transmission was studied by li and genack @xcite , who showed that the far - field and near - field correlations form a fourier - transform pair .",
    "we derive a similar relationship for the frequency correlation , which however is shown to produce an angle - dependent narrowing of the correlation width .",

    ", time - reversal symmetry dictates that for every path contributing to the reflectance , a time - reversed path is present that interferes constructively in exact backscattering .",
    "this effect , which is a manifestation of weak localization , is known in photonics as the coherent backscattering ( cbs ) effect.@xcite the constructive interference in coherent backscattering results in a cone of enhanced intensity versus angle around the backscattering direction , which is of order unity in intensity for all scattering strengths .",
    "the angular extent of the cbs cone increases proportional to the photonic strength @xmath1 of the medium , where @xmath2 denotes the wavevector of light in the medium and @xmath3 denotes the ( boltzmann ) transport mean free path.@xcite    effects of coherent backscattering have been observed in the time - correlation function of colloidal suspensions@xcite and in the angular correlation function ( memory effect).@xcite however , the direct contribution of time - reversed light paths has never been investigated for the frequency correlation .",
    "a pronounced angle - dependence of this correlation can be expected from the relationship between the time duration of a short pulse after diffuse propagation and the spectral correlation function@xcite , combined with the observation of angle - dependent changes in the pulse propagation time in scattering media.@xcite we present here both a theoretical and experimental description of this effect , using a series of strongly scattering scattering media with scattering strengths ranging from the diffuse scattering to the strongly photonic regime . by varying the scattering strength ,",
    "we study the breakdown of the diffusion approximation for the correlations in coherent backscattering .",
    "we report results showing that the frequency correlation depends on scattering strength in a new and previously unexplored way , and which indicate that the frequency correlation may provide a more sensitive means for accessing long light paths compared to the conventional intensity cbs effect.@xcite generally , the frequency correlation can be used to obtain information on the distribution of photon dwell times complementary to time - resolved experiments , which are usually not easily extended to angle - dependent measurements.@xcite in addition , we discuss the possibility that the combination of cbs and frequency correlations yields additional higher - order correlation effects , which are unique for the four - field correlation and are not found in conventional intensity measurements .",

    "fig : c1expkl](a ) starting from the diffuse scattering regime . in the cbs cone , the wings of the cone correspond to very short transverse distances between the point of entry and the point of exit of light in the medium , of the order of the mean free path @xmath3.@xcite the frequency broadening @xmath113 in the wings is sensitive to the phase delay of these short paths relative to that of the total distribution . in the @xmath0 approximation ,",
    "the maximum frequency broadening @xmath114 is independent of @xmath110 , as indicated by the dash - dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : c1expkl](a ) .",
    "the deviation of our experimental data from this line can be caused by two possible types of effects , which either affect the dwell time , or which add new contributions to the spectral correlation . to",
    "the first type belongs the cutoff of long light paths and the associated distribution of decay times near localization.@xcite the second type includes higher order contributions to the correlation function known as @xmath126.@xcite several authors have considered this contribution in a reflection geometry.@xcite the angular @xmath126 correlation is inversely proportional to the illumination area , and is expected to be negligibly small for the geometry of our experiment . in contrast , the near - field correlation in reflection is a local effect on a length scale of order @xmath101 , which does not vanish for plane wave illumination .",
    "this long - range near - field correlation has been calculated by stephen and czwilich as@xcite @xmath127 equation  ( [ eq : c2stephen ] ) shows that , for short the distances @xmath128 , contributing to the wings of the cbs cone , the near - field intensities are much stronger correlated than for distances @xmath129 contributing to the center of the cone .",

    "l and c are ladder and cooperon vertices , h indicates the hikami - box vertex consisting of three terms.@xcite , width=283 ]    at this stage , a full theoretical framework of the @xmath126 contribution to the coherent backscattering frequency correlation has yet to be developed .",
    "figure  [ fig : hikami ] shows the higher - order diagrams that have to be included in such an extended model , following ref .  .",
    "the four - field correlation takes place through the hikami - box vertex , which is not present in the conventional intensity cbs .",
    "in addition , interference with an unscattered , reduced incident intensity may be important.@xcite in a different context , these shadow terms have been identified for their role in energy conservation in the cbs - cone.@xcite althogether , the frequency correlation cbs may contain new information compared to the conventional intensity cbs , where @xmath126 is only a background.@xcite this is important as our measurements show a collapse of the cbs effect in the correlation function , while the intensity cbs cone is still intact .",
    "a crucial point is that self - interference due to the intersection of paths is associated with a finite intersection volume of order @xmath130 , with @xmath131 the optical wavelength.@xcite this is especially relevant in the wings of the cbs cone , where the transverse distance between the path ends is only one mean free path @xmath3 .",

    "[ eq : c2stephen ] , the condition @xmath132 is reached when @xmath133 . the breakdown of the weak - scattering limit for the @xmath0 correlation is thus expected to occur far above the localization limit @xmath134 in the wings of the cbs cone . the line in fig .",

    "in particular , we compare the new technique to measurements of the cbs - cone rounding in intensity measurements.@xcite figure  [ fig : comparisons ] shows both the cone rounding angle @xmath136 and the suppression of the frequency broadening @xmath11 , as a function of the path length cutoff defined by a ( total ) length @xmath137 . for simplicity",
    "we choose an exponential cutoff such as is the case for absorption in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hslab ] ) , however alternative choices of the path length scaling are available to describe other effects such as localization.@xcite experiments on the same porous gap samples have identified an anomalous cone rounding @xmath138 of around 4  mrad.@xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparisons ] this value corresponds to a value @xmath139 of @xmath140 , or a cutoff length @xmath137 of around 1  mm for the porous gap sample . in comparison , for the same @xmath139",

    "experimentally we have observed , for the same sample as used in ref .",

    "recent experiments have reported sizeable corrections to diffuse transport for values of @xmath142 larger than 1 ( respectively @xmath143 and @xmath144 in refs .   and  ) .",
    "self - consistent theories of time - dependent diffusion@xcite predict a reduction of the diffusion constant in this regime , which should lead to a narrowing of the spectral correlation .",

    "[ fig : c1expkl](b ) .",
    "however , we point out that both the horizontal axis depending on @xmath3 and the vertical axis depending on @xmath28 should be renormalized in this regime , making it hard to observe these renormalizations experimentally as there is no absolute reference against which these can be calibrated .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied both theoretically and experimentally the angle - dependence of frequency correlations in random photonic media both in transmission and in reflection .",
    "a narrowing of the spectral correlation was found which depends on both the scattering angle and the incident beam waist , which could be identified as an additional dephasing of the multiple scattered light outside the medium .",
    "this contribution has not been reported in other work on frequency correlations.@xcite we note that earlier experimental studies dealt with much thicker slabs for which the width of the frequency correlation was too small to observe the effect according to fig .",
    "[ fig : narrowing ] .",
    "however , the angle - dependent narrowing is sizeable for frequency widths above 10  @xmath67 , which corresponds to dwell times below 1  ps .",
    "thus the effect is relevant for many nanophotonic materials and thin films in which light trapping plays a role , and particularly in reflection geometries where the path length distibution is governed by short paths on the scale of the mean free path @xmath3 , even for very thick samples .    in backscattering",
    ", we have found a contribution to the frequency correlation which can be attributed to the angle - dependent path length distribution in coherent backscattering .",
    "our diffusion model is confirmed by experiments for scattering materials with inverse photonic strength @xmath145 , however the magnitude of the broadening effect appears reduced for samples with larger scattering strength .",
    "we emphasize that a similar strong dependence is not found for the intensity cbs cones obtained in the same experiment .",
    "thus , the frequency correlation in backscattering may form a new instrument for accessing the breakdown of diffusion theory in the limit of very strong multiple scattering .",
    "earlier work on similar ( and some of the same ) strongly scattering materials revealed no or only weak corrections to classical diffusion.@xcite it has been pointed out that time - resolved transmission is not expected to yield large modifications for the typical samples under study @xcite .",
    "the angle - dependent frequency correlation provides a means for accessing the path length distribution in reflection on much shorter time scales than can be accessed using ultrafast laser pulses .",
    "the frequency - resolved technique thus yields information complimentary to picosecond time - resolved experiments which are usually more involved and not easily extended to studying angle - dependent phenomena.@xcite the frequency correlations in coherent backscattering have the potential to be an even more precise probe of changes in the path length distribution than cone rounding measurements using the intensity cbs , making it an important tool for studying the strong scattering regime near localization .",
    "our results call for new theoretical models for frequency correlations in combination with coherent backscattering in the strong scattering limit .",
