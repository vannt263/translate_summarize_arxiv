    "in an earlier work @xcite we had developed a methodology for the calculation of configuration averaged optical conductivity of a disordered alloy based on the augmented space formalsim developed by one of us @xcite .",
    "the method was based on the kubo - greenwood formula and we had shown that disorder scattering renormalizes both the green functions and the current terms .    in linear response theory , at zero temperature , the generalized susceptibility of a disordered alloy is given by the kubo formula :    @xmath0    where , @xmath1 is the vector potential , and    @xmath2\\rangle\\ ] ]    @xmath3 is the current operator and @xmath4 is the heaviside step function .",
    "if the underlying lattice has cubic symmetry , @xmath5 = @xmath6 .",
    "the fluctuation dissipation theorem then relates the imaginary part of the laplace transform of the generalized susceptibility to the laplace transform of a correlation function :    @xmath7 where ,    @xmath8    since the response function is independent of the direction label @xmath9 for cubic symmetry , in the following we shall drop this symbol . in case of other symmetries",
    "we have to generalize our results for different directions .",
    "our goal will be , given a quantum  hamiltonian \" * h * to obtain the correlation function ,    @xmath10    we shall now determine the correlation directly via the recursion method as described by viswnath and mller@xcite . in order to simplify the expressions for the dynamical quantities as produced by the hamiltonian",

    "we shall discuss the salient features of this method for application to configuration averages of correlation functions .",
    "the problem addressed involves the configuration averaging of a function of many independent random variables , e.g. @xmath31 where @xmath32 labels a set of lattice points . the first step is to associate with each random variable @xmath33 an operator @xmath34 such that the spectral density of this operator is the probability density of the random variable :    @xmath35    for example , if @xmath33 takes the values 0 and 1 with probabilities @xmath36 and @xmath37 then the operator *",

    "for application of our methodology we have chosen two alloy systems disordered : cuau ( 50 - 50 ) and disordered agau ( 50 - 50 ) .",
    "our choice was governed by two considerations : first , we had studied these alloys in an earlier work with a different approach @xcite and it would be interesting to compare the two approaches ; and secondly , the fact that we have experimental data available for both these alloys and it would be interesting to compare our theoretical estimates with experiment . we have begun our study with the self - consistent tb - lmto - asr calculation on agau and cuau 50 - 50 alloys .",
    "we have minimized the energy with respect to the variation in the average lattice constant for both the alloys .",
    "we have calculated the current terms from the basis functions and potential parameters obtained from a tb - lmto calculation for the ordered 50 - 50 alloys .",
    "ideally we should have embedded aa , bb and ab pairs in the disordered medium and obtained the current expressions from such a calculation . however , in our earlier work @xcite we have shown that effect of randomness in the current terms is small .",
    "this gives us confidence to proceed with these estimates .    to check the density of states for the disordered alloys we have used our tb - lmto - asr programme developed by us @xcite .",
    "the density of states has been shown in our earlier work @xcite .",
    "the main features of interest is that the filled @xmath91-states lie about 2 ev below the fermi level for both these alloys .",
    "= 2.5 in = 2.5 in + = 2.5 in = 2.5 in +    in figure [ fig2 ] we show the continued fraction coefficients for a few different angular momentum components . the coefficients do show a tendency of showing oscillatory convergence , but within the maximum ten steps that we were able to go , it was not possible to accurately locate the converged values .",
    "we therefore chose not to use the square - root terminator , but opted for the beer - pettifor terminator @xcite .",
    "= 3.5 in    experimental data on disordered cuau ( 50 - 50 ) are available @xcite .",
    "the authors have reported high resolution optical data for both ordered and disordered cuau for photon energies between 1.2 ev and 6 ev . in the figure [ fig3 ] , we also show the experimental data for @xmath92 in dotted lines and compare it with the theoretical data in figure [ fig3](bold lines ) .",
    "drude like behaviour is clearly seen till photon energies of @xmath93 2.1 ev in theory and around 2 ev in the experiment .",
    "subsequently @xmath92 rises again because of transitions from the @xmath91-states . both the theory and experiment",
    "show a decrease around 6 ev .",
    "the experimental curve shows a sharper dip and the subsequent peak is at a lower energy .",
    "we have experimental data on agau ( 50 - 50 ) @xcite , whose density of states closely resembles cuau . the inter - band contribution to the imaginary part of the dielectric function @xmath94 may be obtained from the optical conductivity data , by subtracting away the drude contribution and dividing the result by @xmath95 : @xmath96 . below the onset of the inter - band transitions , this quantity vanishes .",
    "it shows a shoulder around 2.5 ev and then reaches a maximum at around 3.5 ev before decreasing and showing a feature around 5.5 ev .",
    "= 3.5 in    as in the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) estimates of banhart @xcite there is a @xmath97 0.5ev shift outwards in the theoretical estimate . in the above figure",
    "we have shifted our theoretical data by 0.5ev downwards for comparison .",
    "banhart attributes this shift to the foundations of the electronic theory used : local density approximation which can not reproduce excited states properly .",
    "this had been discussed also by fehrenbach and bross @xcite . to this",
    "we shall add that it is doubtful whether the energy linearized tb - lmto can accurately reproduce the large energy window of our calculation .",
    "it may be useful in future to base our calculations on the newly developed nmto formalism @xcite .",
    "in addition , the termination procedure of the recursion requires further refinement , as the convergence of the continued fraction coefficients is not as rapid as in density of states calculations .",
    "banhart notes that the cpa neglects all short - ranged order .",
    "however , since our calculations in the augmented space recursion does include correlated scattering from different sites , we can not attribute the discrepancy to the cpa .",
    "apart from the energy shift , the experimental data are in reasonable agreement with our theory . the general shape with a maximum is clearly reproduced .",
    "the feature shown in the experimental data around 5.5 ev is also seen in our theoretical estimate , slightly shifted in energy .",
    "the shoulder in the experimental data just above 2 ev is not properly reproduced in the theoretical curve .",
    "the cpa estimate of banhart ( @xcite ) also does not seem to show such a prominent shoulder .",
    "is it possible that the experimental alloy had short ranged order ? it is known that short - ranged order can have influence on optical properties ( @xcite ) .",
    "the augmented state formalism can handle short - ranged order ( @xcite ) and we shall study this effect in a future communication .",
