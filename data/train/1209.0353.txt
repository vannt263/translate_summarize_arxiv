    "the origin of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) , whose energies are above @xmath3 , has been searched for many years ; however , it is still in vague . in the search for the origin of uhecr , the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) suppression @xcite plays an important role .",
    "this suppression tells us that the sources of uhecr with energies above the gzk cutoff , @xmath4 , should be located within the gzk radius , @xmath5 , because the uhecr coming from beyond the gzk radius can not reach us by loosing energies as consequences of the interactions between cosmic microwave background photons .",
    "the recent observations @xcite support the gzk suppression , thus we can focus on the source candidates lying within @xmath6 .    for the possible sources of uhecr , several kinds of astrophysical objects have been proposed , such as @xmath0-ray bursts , radio galaxies , and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite which are known to be able to accelerate uhecr enough . to verify that these astrophysical objects could be the sources of uhecr ,",
    "it is worthwhile to compare the arrival directions of uhecr and the positions of source candidates using statistical tests .",
    "although many statistical studies for correlation have been done @xcite , the origin of uhecr is not confirmed yet .    in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we examined the agn model , where uhecr with energies above a certain energy cutoff are generated from the agn lying within a certain distance cut .",
    "we used agn listed in vron - cetty and vron ( vcv ) catalog @xcite and the uhecr data observed by pierre auger observatory ( pao ) @xcite . by statistical test methods",
    ", we concluded that the whole agn listed in vcv catalog can not be the true sources of uhecr and pointed out that a certain subset of listed agn could be the true sources of uhecr .",
    "some subsets of agn , which have the counterpart in x - ray or @xmath0-ray bands have been tested for the possibility that they are responsible for uhecr @xcite . in the case of the correlation with agn detected in hard x - ray band , it is found that the fractional excess of pairs relative to the isotropic expectation @xcite . in the case of agn detected in @xmath0-ray band",
    ", a marginal correlation is found when we consider the small angular separations only , but the strong correlation is found when we consider the angular separations up to @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on the statistical tests for the correlation of uhecr with certain subsets of agn , especially @xmath0-ray loud agn because @xmath0-ray loud agn have sufficient power to accelerate uhecr . in section [ sec2 ] , the source models of uhecr which assume that uhecr with @xmath8 come from agn with @xmath9 which are emitting strong @xmath0-rays",
    "is presented .",
    "based on the @xmath0-ray loud agn model we construct , we create the mock arrival directions of uhecr by monte - carlo simulation . in section [ sec3 ] , we describe the uhecr data and the @xmath0-ray loud agn data we use in our analysis .",
    "we use 2010 pao data @xcite for observed uhecr data and the second catalog of agn detected by the fermi large area telescope ( lat ) @xcite for the @xmath0-ray loud agn data . to test the correlation between the observed uhecr and the @xmath0-ray loud agn , the methods which can compare the distribution of observed uhecr arrival direction and that of the mock uhecr arrival direction expected from the source model are needed to be established .",
    "the brief descriptions of our test methods are provided in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "the results of statistical tests are given in section [ sec5 ] and the discussion and the conclusion follow in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "several astrophysical objects are know to be able to accelerate cr up to ultra - high energy . among them , agn are the most popular objects since the strong correlation was claimed by pao @xcite .",
    "however , its updated analysis results and other studies exclude the hypothesis that the whole set of agn is responsible for the uhecr @xcite . in our previous work @xcite , using pao uhecr having energies above @xmath10 @xcite and agn within @xmath11 listed in the 13th edition of vcv catalog @xcite , we concluded that we can reject the hypothesis that the whole agn within @xmath11 are the real sources of uhecr .",
    "also , we tested the possibility that the subset of agn is responsible for uhecr ; we took agn within arbitrary distance band as source candidates and found a good correlation for agn within @xmath12 .",
    "however , we do not have a reasonable physical explanation for distance grouping .",
    "this motivates us to try the subclass of agn with proper physical properties appropriate for uhecr acceleration .    in this paper",
    ", we study the hypotheses that agn emitting strong @xmath0-ray are the sources of uhecr , based on the theoretical study in ref . @xcite .",
    "dermer et al .",
    "calculated the emissivity of non - thermal radiation from agn using the first fermi lat agn catalog ( 1lac ) @xcite to confirm that they have sufficient power to accelerate uhecr . in the fermi acceleration mechanism using colliding shell model , they found that some of agn listed in 1lac have enough power to accelerate uhecr .",
    "( see the figure 3 . in @xcite . )",
    "therefore , we set up the @xmath0-ray loud agn model for the uhecr source in the same way as our agn model introduced in our previous work @xcite .    when uhecr propagate through the universe , uhecr undergo deflection of its trajectory by intergalactic magnetic fields .",
    "these phenomena are embedded in the simulation for the mock uhecr expected from the agn model to compare with observed uhecr by introducing the smearing angle parameter ( @xmath13 ) and by restricting the distance of the source ( @xmath14 ) and the energy of observed uhecr ( @xmath15 ) following the gzk suppression .",
    "we study two versions of @xmath0-ray loud agn models in this paper .",
    "the first one assumes that uhecr with energies @xmath8 come from agn which are emitting strong @xmath0-rays with distance @xmath9 , and the second one assumes that among the @xmath0-ray loud agn those having tev or very high energies @xmath0-ray emission are responsible for the uhecr . the same constraints of uhecr energy and agn distance are applied to these models .",
    "we call the first one the @xmath0-ray loud agn model , and the second one the tev @xmath0-ray agn model .",
    "the uhecr flux in the simulation for these two models are described below . the expected uhecr flux at a given arrival direction @xmath16 is composed of the @xmath0-ray loud agn contribution and the isotropic background contribution @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the distribution of all agn within the distance cut and @xmath19 the contribution of isotropic background from the outside of distance cut @xmath14 .",
    "that is , a certain fraction of uhecr is coming from agn and the remaining fraction of them is originated from the isotropic background .",
    "we introduce the agn fraction parameter @xmath20 as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the average agn - contributed flux .    in the next step ,",
    "we consider two approaches for @xmath18 because the relation between uhecr flux and agn property is not established yet .",
    "the uhecr flux from all agn can be written as @xmath23\\,,\\\\ \\label{uhecr - flux}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the uhecr luminosity , @xmath25 is the distance , @xmath26 is the angle between the direction @xmath16 and the @xmath27-th agn , @xmath28 is the smearing angle of the @xmath27-th agn .",
    "the first approach assumes that all agn have the same uhecr luminosity , @xmath29 , and the same smearing angle , @xmath30 .",
    "the second approach assumes that the uhecr flux contributed by agn is proportional to the @xmath0-ray flux of agn .",

    "although the normalization is needed for the accurate expression of eq .",
    "( [ uhecr - flux ] ) and ( [ uhecr - photon - flux ] ) , we neglect it because we are not concerned with the total flux of uhecr in the test .",
    "we have two free parameters in our model for the simulation , the smearing angle @xmath13 and the agn fraction @xmath20 . for the fiducial values of @xmath13 and @xmath20 ,",
    "we take @xmath34 @xcite and @xmath35 @xcite .    in the last step for realizing the mock uhecr in the simulation",
    ", we need to consider the exposure function reflecting the efficiency of the detector .",
    "the geometric efficiency of the detector depends on the location of the experimental site and the zenith angle cut .",

    "we get the information on the @xmath0-ray loud agn from the second catalog of fermi lat agn ( 2lac ) published in 2011 @xcite .",
    "the 2lac includes the agn information collected by the fermi lat for two years .",
    "it contains 1017 @xmath0-ray sources located at high galactic latitude ( @xmath43 ) as the low galactic latitude region is masked by the galactic plane.that region is excluded because the low galactic latitude region is too noisy to be investigated due to diffuse radio emission , interloping galactic point sources , and heavy optical extinction .",

    ", the critical value of the agn fraction is @xmath67 and the critical value of the smearing angle is @xmath68",
    ". we can deduce that it is hard to describe the observed uhecr distribution from t - d model .",
    "next , let us compare the results of two models with the same source agn but with different uhecr flux models : the model which assumes that uhecr flux is proportional to the inverse square of the distance of source agn and the model which assumes that uhecr flux is proportional to the @xmath0-ray flux of source agn .",
    "when we compare @xmath0-d model to @xmath0-f model , the critical values of the agn fraction and the smearing angle are @xmath65 and @xmath66 for the @xmath0-d model , and the critical values of the agn fraction and the smearing angle are @xmath69 and @xmath70 for the @xmath0-f model .",
    "we can exclude the agn models in the cases having the parameters within the critical values ( blue line ) .",
    "there is no crucial distinction between the different uhecr flux models for the @xmath0-ray loud agn models .",
    "however , when we compare t - d model to t - f model , the different uhecr flux models result in the meaningful distinction . in the t - d model ,",
    "cen a is a dominant source to generate the mock uhecr , thus they are clustered around cen a. nevertheless , there is no significant difference among cen a , m87 , and ngc 1275 to produce the mock uhecr in the t - f model , thus the mock uhecr are clustered not only around cen a but also around m87 and ngc 1275 .",
    "this is the reason why the probability is increased dramatically as the smearing angle increases in the t - f model .",
    "the proportion of the mock uhecr produced by ngc 1275 which is located outside of the field of view increases as the smearing angle increases .",
    "therefore , the clustered feature of the t - d model is quite different from the t - f model and the small number of source cause the clear discrepancy .    in short ,",
    "we find that the source models assuming @xmath0-ray loud agn are responsible for uhecr ( @xmath0-d model and @xmath0-f model ) are more plausible than the source models assuming agn having higher energy are responsible for uhecr ( t - d model and t - f model ) . also , which flux model is appropriate for describing the uhecr flux is not conclusive yet .",
    "this seems worthwhile to continue to study . at this stage",
    ", we can state the critical values that the null hypotheses are rejected .",
    "the critical regions are inside the @xmath64 contours .",
    "for the @xmath0-d model , the critical values of the agn fraction and the smearing angle are @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and for the @xmath0-f model , the critical values of the agn fraction and the smearing angle are @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the critical values are @xmath67 and @xmath68 in the case of the t - d model and the critical values are @xmath71 and @xmath72 in the case of the t - f model .",

    "the purpose of this work was to test the possibility of a subclass of agn which emit strong @xmath0-rays as the source of uhecr .",
    "we can not confirm that the source model using @xmath0-ray loud agn is better than the source model using whole agn in explaining the distribution of arrival direction of uhecr .",
    "compared to the results of our previous work @xcite , which assumes that whole agn in the vcv catalog are the source of uhecr , the contour of @xmath62 is changed and the overall probability distribution for each hypothesis is higher than the previous results .",
    "( see the probability plot for the @xmath0-d model and the left panel of fig . 7 in @xcite . )",
    "however , we can not tell @xmath0-ray loud agn model describes the observation well definitely because the higher probabilities mean that the simulated distribution by models are consistent with the observed distribution only .",
    "nemmen et al .",
    "@xcite investigate the correlation of uhecr with @xmath0-ray loud agn using the first 27 pao data and 1lac . since the data set and the constraints used in our work and those used in their work are different , we need to compare the results carefully . to test cross - correlation between pao and 1lac ,",
    "they count the cumulative number of correlated uhecr as a function of angular distance from the 1lac sources located within @xmath73 .",
    "they find that the angular distance @xmath74 which minimizes the probability that the observed distribution would be the isotropic one .",
    "although we pointed out that this method is not suitable to test the cross - correlation directly because it focuses on the deviation from isotropy rather than the direct correlation in the previous paper @xcite , the result is consistent with our results that @xmath0-ray loud agn dominance models having small smearing angle could be rejected",
    ".    the study of arrival direction of uhecr and its source could be one way of estimating the magnitude of the intervening magnetic fields or identifying the primary particle . if it is true that the @xmath0-ray loud agn could be the source of uhecr",
    ", the large smearing angle may imply the large deflections by intervening magnetic field .",
    "interestingly , the larger deflection angles than traditional prediction ones are estimated by ryu et al .",
    "@xcite , also .",
    "these may support the measurements of the shower maximum by pao @xcite the primary particle is presumed to be heavy nuclei . in addition , the results by dermer et al .",
    "@xcite show that heavy nuclei are more likely to be accelerated to ultra - high energy in agn . taken together , it is possible that the primary particle would be heavy nuclei .    in summary , we tested the possibility that the @xmath0-ray emitting agn are the sources of uhecr .",
    "we took two sub - classes of agn .",
    "one is the set of agn emitting strong @xmath0-rays observed by fermi lat and the other one is the subset of the former having @xmath0-rays in tev band . for the uhecr flux , we considered two possibilities : uhecr flux is proportional to the inverse square of the distance times the luminosity of its source and uhecr flux is proportional to the photon flux of agn .",
    "we used uhecr with @xmath75 and based on gzk suppression , we restricted agn to be within @xmath46 . also , we introduced two free parameters in the simulation to produce the mock uhecr , agn fraction @xmath20 and smearing angle @xmath13 so that we could manipulated the contribution of the source candidate and the deflection by intervening magnetic fields . to compare the distributions of observed uhecr to that of the mock uhecr",
    ", we adopted cadd which is suitable to test cross - correlation between uhecr and sources .",
    "the probabilities for 4 models calculated by ks test using cadd tells us that tev agn model with uhecr flux proportional to the inverse square of the distance is not appropriate to depict the observation .",
    "rather , tev agn model with uhecr flux proportional to the photon flux is more plausible to describe the observation . in the cases of @xmath0-ray loud agn models ,",
    "the effects of different flux models was not significant .",
    "if we reject the agn models having the parameters within the @xmath64 contour , the critical values are @xmath76 and @xmath77 for the the @xmath0-ray loud agn models with uhecr flux proportional to the inverse square of the distance , and the critical values are @xmath78 and @xmath79 for the the @xmath0-ray loud agn models with uhecr flux proportional to the @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "this means that the models having large isotropic background with @xmath0-ray loud agn or the @xmath0-ray loud agn dominance models with large deflection by the intervening magnetic fields make them possible to describe the observed uhecr . at this stage , it is hard to confirm that @xmath0-ray loud agn are the source of uhecr .",
