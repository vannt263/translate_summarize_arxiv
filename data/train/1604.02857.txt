    "curved spacetimes for which the ricci scalar @xmath0 is identically zero have been known in general relativity ( gr ) since the discovery of the schwarzschild solution . while , in gr , the schwarzschild is a vacuum spacetime for which both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are zero , the reissner - nordstrom geometry has @xmath2 but @xmath3 , thereby implying the presence of traceless matter .",
    "it has been further shown in @xcite that a generalisation of schwarzschild spacetime with @xmath4 everywhere finite and non - zero and @xmath2 can be obtained .",
    "more recently @xcite , this @xmath2 wormhole spacetime has been found to be a solution in a scalar - tensor theory of gravity which is also the low energy , effective , on - brane gravity theory for the warped two - brane randall - sundrum model .",
    "the @xmath2 spacetime in @xcite when viewed as a solution in gr , requires matter that violates the weak energy condition ( wec ) .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , in the context of the scalar - tensor theory , the required matter does not violate the wec and the scalar field ( radion ) is also finite and non - zero everywhere . in our work here ,",
    "we further generalise the spacetime studied in @xcite .",
    "in particular , newer @xmath2 spacetimes with @xmath4 everywhere non - zero are constructed and shown to be solutions in scalar - tensor gravity .",
    "a sub - class of such spacetimes are lorentzian wormholes with the required matter satisfying the wec .    in our analysis here , we begin with a general static , spherisymmetric line element for which the @xmath2 constraint is written as a differential equation for @xmath5 .",
    "obviously , this differential equation contains @xmath6 ( or , @xmath7 where @xmath8 ) and its derivatives in its coefficients .",
    "it can therefore be solved once we provide our choice for @xmath7 .",
    "assuming @xmath7 as one should for a lorentzian wormhole , we find that for some specific choices ( eg . the schwarzschild wormhole and the ellis ",
    "bronnikov wormhole @xcite ) the differential equation for @xmath9 can indeed be solved .",
    "we obtain a wide class of geometries in this manner .",
    "thereafter , we show how these geometries fare in terms of the wec violation issue .",
    "as mentioned above , in gr we require wec violation for the matter that threads non - singular wormhole spacetimes .",
    "however , it has been shown recently that , within gr , a wormhole ( which is topologically different from the morris - thorne class ) can be supported by a negative cosmological constant ( which is not quite exotic , wec violating matter ) @xcite .",
    "further , it is known that certain wormhole solutions which have been constructed in various modified theories of gravity such as brans - dicke theory ( scalar - tensor gravity with constant coupling @xmath10 ) @xcite , @xmath11-gravity @xcite , gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite , third - order lovelock gravity @xcite , eddington - inspired born - infeld gravity @xcite , mimetic gravity @xcite , dgp gravity @xcite , do not require wec violating matter .    in our work here ,",
    "we consider scalar - tensor gravity with a non - constant coupling @xmath12 and in the presence of matter stress - energy . through our specific solutions ,",
    "we show that there may not be wec violation for the matter required to support a lorentzian wormhole .",
    "it must be noted though that the timelike convergence condition is still violated , as it must be , for wormholes .",
    "the essential point is that the relation between the convergence condition and the energy condition is not as it is in gr , because of which there is extra freedom to avoid any violation in a modified theory of gravity ( here , scalar - tensor gravity ) @xcite .",
    "our paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : stg ] , we briefly recall scalar - tensor gravity both as an independent theory and in the context of braneworld gravity .",
    "we provide the details of our construction of @xmath2 spacetimes in section [ sec : solution ] .",
    "section [ sec : wec ] and [ sec : m0 ] deal with the status of the wec . in section",
    "[ sec : redshift ] , we study gravitational redshift in the wormhole spacetimes . the existence of stable and unstable circular orbits and the issue of traversability are addressed in section [ sec : traversability ] .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "scalar - tensor theories are well - studied from various angles and perspectives .",
    "the first such theory was , of course , the jordan - brans - dicke theory @xcite .",
    "a scalar field @xmath13 and an extra parameter @xmath10 characterises such theories .",
    "though originally considered a constant , a modified version incorporates a @xmath13-dependent @xmath10 @xcite . in general , the einstein field equations for such theories are given as : @xmath14 where the @xmath15 is the matter energy - momentum tensor and the metric @xmath16 is written in the jordan frame where the action is not in the standard canonical ( einstein - hilbert ) form .",
    "viewed as an independent competitor of gr , a scalar tensor theory could be specified by providing a form for @xmath12 .",
    "note that @xmath13 must satisfy the equation , @xmath17 various aspects of scalar - tensor theories have been extensively studied and we will not review them here . see @xcite and references therein for detailed reviews",
    ". taking the trace of ( [ eq : field_equation1 ] ) and using ( [ eq : scalar_equation ] ) , one obtains @xmath18 note that traceless matter implies @xmath2 in gr .",
    "but , in scalar - tensor gravity , traceless matter does not imply @xmath2 in general .",
    "but , for the specific form of @xmath12 given by @xmath19 @xmath20 and hence , traceless matter implies @xmath2 . here , @xmath21 is an integration constant . as we shall see",
    ", the case @xmath22 arises in the low energy , effective on - brane quasi - scalar - tensor gravity theory developed by kanno and soda @xcite in the context of the randall - sundrum two - brane model .",
    "it is well - known that scalar - tensor theories arise as effective theories of gravity in diverse contexts .",
    "for example , the low - energy effective gravity theory which emerges out of superstring theory contains a scalar known as the dilaton and the theory is a @xmath23 brans - dicke theory @xcite . in the braneworld scenario ,",
    "our four dimensional visible universe is considered as a lower dimensional hypersurface called a brane , which is embedded in a higher dimensional bulk . in the low energy limit , the field equation governing bulk gravity , leads to effective field equations for gravity on the brane .",
    "the presence of the extra dimensional bulk leaves its imprint by modifying the einstein field equations on the brane .",
    "the most popular among the on - brane effective einstein equations was obtained by shiromizu - maeda - sasaki @xcite in the context of a single - brane model and contains a non - local term ( bulk - weyl dependent @xmath24 ) .",
    "the on - brane effective einstein equations obtained by kanno and soda @xcite in the context of the two - brane randall sundrum model , however , does not contain any non - local contribution .",
    "earlier , the non - local @xmath25 was used to obtain @xmath2 spacetime solutions @xcite ( mostly wormhole solutions ) in the single - brane effective theory of shiromizu - maeda - sasaki . in the effective on - brane theory of kanno and soda",
    ", we have an effective energy momentum tensor ( other than the matter on the branes ) constructed from the scalar radion field ( which measures the inter - brane distance ) and its derivatives .",
    "the radion field plays a crucial role in obtaining both static , spherically symmetric spacetimes and cosmological solutions @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the presence of the radion field can correctly reproduce the observed virial mass of galaxy clusters and observed galaxy rotation curves .",
    "thus , the radion field can act as a possible dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "let us now briefly review the low energy effective on - brane quasi - scalar - tensor theory developed by kanno and soda @xcite .",
    "the action is given as , @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the five dimensional gravitational coupling constant , the five dimensional curvature scalar and the induced metric on the branes , respectively . @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the brane - tensions . the positive tension brane a ( planck brane ) and the negative tension brane b ( visible brane ) are respectively placed at fixed bulk locations ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) .",
    "the bulk line element is , @xmath34 where the bulk curvature radius is @xmath35 . assuming the brane curvature radius @xmath36 as large compared to the bulk curvature radius @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath37 , kanno and soda used a low energy expansion scheme ( the gradient expansion method ) wherein the bulk metric and the extrinsic curvature are expanded in powers of @xmath38 .",
    "they obtained the effective field equations , @xmath39 on the visible brane .",
    "here , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are respectively the radion field , the matter on the planck brane , the matter on the visible brane and the metric tensor on the visible brane .",
    "the proper distance @xmath44 between the branes is defined as @xmath45 the radion field @xmath13 satisfies the following equation of motion on the visible brane : @xmath46 where both the traces @xmath47 and @xmath48 are taken with respect to the metric tensor @xmath43 and the coupling function is given by @xmath49 using the radion equation of motion in the trace of the field equation ( [ eq : field_equation ] ) , we obtain @xmath50 , where @xmath0 is the curvature scalar on the visible brane . note",
    "that this is the @xmath22 case discussed earlier .",
    "therefore , traceless matter implies @xmath2 in this theory . using the transformation @xmath51",
    ", we can express the radion equation of motion in the form @xmath52    in the subsequent sections , we obtain our new solutions .",
    "it is important to note that the solutions could either be viewed as solutions in a scalar - tensor theory which has no link with extra dimensions or as solutions in the context of braneworld gravity . in obtaining the solutions , we take the planck brane to be devoid of matter , i.e. , @xmath53 .",
    "further , henceforth , we refer to this on - brane scalar - tensor gravity as kanno - soda theory of gravity because of the specific form of the coupling function @xmath12 given in ( [ eq : coupling2 ] ) .",
    "we begin with the static , spherically symmetric line element given as @xmath54 where @xmath9 and @xmath7 are unknown functions to be determined .",
    "we are interested in vanishing curvature scalar ( @xmath2 ) solutions .",
    "the @xmath2 constraint yields the following second order differential equation for @xmath9 : @xmath55 the above equation can also be re - written as a first order differential equation for @xmath7 .",
    "attempts have been made to find out @xmath2 spacetime solutions in the past @xcite . in most of these articles ,",
    "the authors have ( a ) considered known forms of @xmath9 and obtained solutions by solving the first order differential equation for @xmath7 or ( b ) used some known @xmath2 solutions present in the literature and analysed them in the context of an effective theory of gravity . in our work , we take a different route .",
    "we specify the form of @xmath7 and solve the second order differential equation for @xmath9 .",
    "this way we hope to obtain a more general solution different from those obtained earlier .",
    "another advantage of specifying the form of the shape function @xmath7 is that we can choose to have wormhole solutions with a desired spatial shape .",
    "one can take different forms of @xmath7 . in our work here , we take @xmath56 . putting @xmath57 in the @xmath2 equation , we obtain @xmath58 after some manipulations , the above equation can be re - written in the form @xmath59=0 \\nonumber\\ ] ] which can be integrated to obtain @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are integration constants .",
    "therefore , the line element becomes @xmath63 ^ 2dt^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{dr^2}{1-\\frac{2m}{r}-\\frac{\\beta}{r^2}}+r^2d\\omega^2 \\label{eq : general_metric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is useful to note that , when @xmath64 or @xmath65 , the @xmath66 is of the general form , @xmath67 .",
    "however , when @xmath68 , @xmath69 are both non - zero , this generic form does not hold and we have @xmath70 .",
    "however , it is important to note that , in all cases , the red - shift function is finite and non - zero everywhere .",
    "we now look at special cases of our general solution .",

    ", the spatially schwarzschild solution reduces to the schwarzschild spacetime . taking @xmath77 and @xmath78 in this solution",
    ", we obtain the spatial schwarzschild wormhole obtained in @xcite . for @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 ,",
    "the general metric takes the form @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "this metric has been obtained in @xcite .",
    "this metric reduces to the extreme reissner - nordstr@xmath85 m form for @xmath86 , i.e. , @xmath87 .",
    "the above metric fails to produce spatial ellis geometry because @xmath88 implies @xmath89 .",
    "however , we can obtain spatial ellis geometry from our general solution by taking @xmath64 and @xmath90 .",
    "the line element becomes @xmath91 this new metric has not been obtained before .",
    "note that , due to the presence of the @xmath92 factor in @xmath66 , the above metric is different from the spatial ellis geometry obtained in @xcite for vanishing torsion scalar in the context of modified teleparallel gravity . for @xmath93 , the general",
    "metric reduces to spatial reissner - nordstr@xmath85 m metric .",
    "the spatial reissner - nordstr@xmath85 m metric further reduces to the reissner - nordstr@xmath85 m metric for @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "our focus is on the general metric ( [ eq : general_metric ] ) .",
    "depending on the signs and values of @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the general spacetime may represent a black hole , a wormhole or a naked singularity .",
    "the nature of the solution depends on the presence of the zeroes of @xmath9 and @xmath96 .",
    "we will focus on solutions for which @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the solution for such choices does represent a lorentzian wormhole .    for later use ,",
    "let us now write down the solution in isotropic coordinates .",
    "the transformation from the schwarzschild radial coordinate @xmath100 to the isotropic coordinate @xmath0 is given as @xmath101 using the transformation between @xmath100 and @xmath0 we obtain , in isotropic coordinates , the line element , @xmath102 where @xmath103 @xmath104 and @xmath105 the constants @xmath106 and @xmath107 are given as @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath110 and @xmath111 are related to @xmath106 and @xmath107 as follows : @xmath112 it can be shown that , for a spacetime without a horizon @xmath113 is necessary .",
    "we will use the isotropic coordinate form of the line element while discussing the weak energy condition .    defining @xmath114",
    "one can solve the radion field equation as shown in @xcite .",
    "obviously one ends up introducing a new constant which we denote as @xmath115 .",
    "we have @xmath116 where we have omitted an overall additive constant .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath117 is never zero as along as @xmath118 .",
    "note that the domain of @xmath119 is from @xmath120 to @xmath121 , where @xmath122 corresponds to the wormhole throat .",
    "we will now turn towards analysing the weak energy condition inequalities and demonstrate that it can indeed be satisfied for the wormhole we have constructed .",
    "the weak energy condition comprises the inequalities @xmath123 for a diagonal energy momentum tensor with energy density @xmath124 , radial pressure @xmath125 and tangential pressures @xmath126 defined in the static observer s frame .",
    "physically , the wec means that the matter energy density is always non - negative in any frame of reference .    for our case here , we have , for the l.h.s . of the wec inequalities , @xmath127\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath128\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath129\\ ] ]    where the last equation follows from the traceless requirement on the matter energy momentum tensor .    for arbitrary values of the parameters it is not possible to satisfy these inequalities .",
    "however , one can isolate the negativity by looking at the requirements that emerge near @xmath130 . in the limit @xmath131",

    "this violates the wec in the limit @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , we must set the coefficient of @xmath139 in @xmath137 to zero .",
    "this yields the following expression for @xmath115 .",

    "therefore , it is clear from the traceless condition that , at the @xmath143 , positivity of @xmath124 implies positivity of @xmath138 .",
    "note that , at this point , @xmath106 and @xmath107 can be chosen so that @xmath124 and @xmath145 are positive .",
    "however , we choose those values of @xmath106 and @xmath107 for which the coefficient of the @xmath143 term in @xmath124 vanishes .",
    "this gives us the following requirement on @xmath145 .",
    "@xmath146 equating the above two expressions for @xmath145 , one arrives at a relation between @xmath106 and @xmath107 which must be obeyed .",

    "the set of values for @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath115 can therefore be used to write down the line element and the scalar field profile for a lorentzian wormhole in scalar - tensor gravity which will satisfy all the wec inequalities .",
    "the central issue at this point is whether we can obtain an analytical handle on the relation between @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "to get rid of the logarithm , we can assume @xmath148 .",
    "this will eventually lead us to a quartic equation in @xmath107 for which we can obtain the positive , real valued roots in terms of @xmath149 .",

    "in the orthonormal basis of the traveler frame , the magnitude of the acceleration is given by @xcite @xmath266 let us now consider both @xmath267 and @xmath268 to be finite at the throat .",
    "therefore , at the throat @xmath221 , we have @xmath269 for the wormhole solutions , we must have @xmath113 . therefore , for a given @xmath221 and @xmath68 which restrict the tidal acceleration below one earth gravity",
    ", the magnitude of the acceleration can be made arbitrarily small by taking @xmath110 to be very close to zero which , of course , satisfies the wec ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ec2 ] ) .",
    "in this work , we have obtained a class of static , spherically symmetric @xmath2 spacetimes which generalise certain known @xmath2 line elements .",
    "we have shown that our spacetimes can arise in a scalar - tensor theory of gravity , an example of which is the low energy , effective on - brane gravity theory developed by kanno and soda @xcite in the context of the randall - sundrum two - brane model .",
    "some special cases of the general solution reproduce the @xmath2 spacetimes obtained earlier by other authors in the context of gr and in the on - brane effective gravity theory due to shiromizu - maeda - sasaki @xcite for a single - brane scenario .",
    "a sub - class of the general spacetimes found by us represents @xmath2 lorentzian wormholes .",
    "we have studied the wec for the matter that supports such wormholes and have shown that they can satisfy wec .",
    "this is in contrast to gr , where such wormholes must violate wec .",
    "we have also shown that the mass term in the metric functions is necessary to satisfy the wec for these wormholes .",
    "note that most of the wormhole solutions obtained in @xcite are in vacuum - brans - dicke theory .",
    "however , the solutions we have obtained include both matter and a non - constant , i.e. , a @xmath13-dependent coupling @xmath12 . as a additional curiosity",
    ", we also looked at the wec for the naked singularity with the parameter @xmath64 , and have found that it is violated .",
    "apart from constructing solutions and checking the wec , we have calculated the gravitational redshift of a light signal traveling in such wormholes and have found that the wec restricts the amount of redshift to be below @xmath203 .",
    "furthermore , we obtained the effective potentials for particle motion and investigated the possibility of circular orbits in these wormhole spacetimes .",
    "it has been shown that both stable and unstable circular orbits exist for the timelike case .",
    "for the null case , only unstable circular orbits are possible if the wec is satisfied .",
    "but , stable null circular orbits exist if the wec is violated . finally , we analysed traversability in such wormholes and found that they are traversable for values of the metric parameters satisfying the wec .",
    "therefore , we now have wormholes which satisfy the wec and are traversable .",
    "in addition , they may also be viewed as on - brane spacetimes if one considers the existence of warped extra dimensions of the randall - sundrum variety , in a two - brane context .",
    "in such a context the scalar field ( radion ) is related to the inter - brane distance and we have seen that this can always be kept finite and non - zero everywhere .",
    "recently , it has been argued that the universal ringdown waveforms from a binary coalescence indicate the presence of light rings , rather than of horizons @xcite .",
    "therefore , an object ( e.g. a traversable wormhole ) with a light ring will display a similar initial ringdown stage ( waveform ) , even when its quasinormal mode spectrum is completely different from that of a black hole .",
    "however , their late time ringdown stages are different @xcite . it has further been shown that , if one does not use the thin - shell wormhole ( the one used in @xcite ) obtained by special matching near the schwarzschild radius but prefers a wormhole configuration constructed without thin - shells instead , a wormhole may ring like a black hole or differently at all times , depending on the values of the wormhole and black hole parameters @xcite .",
    "this leads to the hope that the lorentzian wormholes we have obtained here , may be relevant in such studies and may have an observational consequence in astrophysics , in future .",
    "further , it is to be noted that the @xmath2 spacetime solution we have obtained can be used in the context of any other theory of gravity ( different from the one considered here ) to study the relation between the energy conditions and wormholes . we have noted that a sub - class of our @xmath2 spacetimes represents naked singularities .",
    "therefore , as a observational test , it will be interesting to study gravitational lensing in the spacetimes we have obtained here and to see whether we can find ways to distinguish between wormholes and naked singularities @xcite through observations .",
