    "long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are now considered to be death of massive stars ( so called collapsar scenario ) .",
    "the most convincing observational evidences have been associations with supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "some associations were spectroscopically , others were photometrically . however , there is at least one long grb , grb  060614 ( duration @xmath8 sec , @xcite ) whose sn component was not detectable to very deep limits .",
    "grb  060505 is also a @xmath9 sec burst without a detectable sn @xcite , although its duration @xmath10 4 sec is close to the classical 2 sec threshold which separates the long and short populations of grbs .",
    "various progenitor models have been proposed to explain these events .",
    "some suggested they are short grbs , which are considered to originate in mergers of double compact object binary , with longer duration than typical short grbs @xcite , while others point out similarities of these grbs to other long bursts which originate from collapsars @xcite .",
    "the possibility of new populations which are different from long and short grbs are also suggested for these grbs @xcite .",
    "the sample of long grbs with strong constraints on their sn components is still small , and it is still uncertain what impact do the long grbs without sne have upon our understanding of the grb populations .    here we present results of a search for a sn component associated with grb  100418a .",
    "grb  100418a was triggered at 21:10:08 ut april 2010 @xcite .",
    "the duration and the energetics of the prompt emission were @xmath11 second and @xmath12 erg @xcite .",
    "follow - up spectroscopies of the optical transient ( ot ) detected emission - lines and absorption lines with the common redshift of 0.624 @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the light curve of grb  100418a is similar to previous grbs with sne .",
    "@xcite reported flattening of the optical light curve after 700 ks .    throughout this paper",
    ", we assume the fiducial cosmology with the hubble constant of 71 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the angular scale is thus 6.8 kpc / arcsec .",
    "we use the ab magnitude system unless otherwise stated .",
    "we observed the field of grb  100418a with focas @xcite on subaru telescope @xcite under a photometric condition ( seeing  ) on 2010 may 14 ( ut ) .",
    "we started imaging observations in @xmath16 , and @xmath17 bands at 12:13 ut , and spectroscopic observations followed .",
    "the log of the observations is tabulated in table  [ tb : observation ] .",
    "we acquired a single exposure of 120 seconds in each of @xmath16 , and @xmath17 bands with 2@xmath182 binning which yields pixel scale of /pixel .",
    "unbinned @xmath19band images were also taken with /pixel .",
    "spectroscopy was performed with width slit and 3 pixels binned along the spatial direction , and two different settings of grisms and order - cut filter .",
    "one setting covered a wavelength range between 5800   and 10200   with the r300 grism and the o58 order - cut filter , and the other covered between 3900   and 8300   with the b300 grism and no order - cut filter .",
    "the total integration time was 1 hour ( 1200 sec x 3 ) for each of the setting .",
    "we used the atmospheric dispersion corrector , and set the slit position angle to @xmath20 , i.e. , north - south .",
    "the spectral resolution is @xmath21 11    in both settings .",
    "the data were reduced using iraf for the procedures of bias subtraction and flat - fielding .",
    "the spectra were wavelength calibrated , and sky subtracted .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed using night sky emission lines for the red setting and thar arc lines for the blue setting .",
    "and the rms wavelength calibration error is 0.20.3   .",
    "the sensitivity calibration was performed as a function of wavelength by using the spectrum of feige 34 observed with width slit . for imaging data ,",
    "the flux calibration was carried out by observing the standard star pg  1505 - 027 field @xcite at the same night .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure1.eps    ( 160mm,80mm)figure2.eps    the @xmath2band image of /pixel is shown in figure  [ fig : r1x1 ] , and the observed spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : fullspectra ] .",
    "these spectra are made by summing along the slit in order to include whole galaxy light .",
    "we found strong emission lines such as [ o ] , h@xmath22 , h@xmath23 , [ o ] which are redshifted 0.624 consistently to the previous reports @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we use the @xmath24 method described in @xcite , which gives two solutions of possible metallicity ( upper and lower branch ) .",
    "@xmath25 @xcite found [ ne]3869/[o]3727 line flux ratio correlates with metallicity , and thus can be used as a indicator to separate these two solutions .",
    "they showed that galaxies with 12+log(o / h ) @xmath26 8.65 have log  [ ne]3869/[o]3727 @xmath27 , while galaxies with 12+log(o / h ) @xmath28 have log  [ ne]3869/[o]3727 @xmath29 .",
    "the host galaxy of grb  100418a has log  [ ne]3869/[o]3727 = @xmath30 , which suggests that the upper branch solution is the case .",
    "there are several emission line diagnostics proposed to measure metallicity , and their results are not always consistent to each other ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we note that metallicities discussed in @xcite is measuered using the @xcite method for high - metallicity galaxies , and the electron temperature method @xcite for low - metallicity galaxies",
    ". however , the difference between the results of the @xcite method and that of the @xcite method is small in high - metallicity range , and the @xcite method tends to result in higher - metallicity in low - metallicity range compared to other methods @xcite .",
    "hence the difference between the metallicity calibration we use and that used in @xcite would not confuse the separation of the two branches .",
    "we also estimate star formation rate ( sfr ) of the host galaxy from the emission line flux . following h@xmath23sfr relation used in @xcite in which the imf of @xcite is assumed , sfr of the host galaxy is 1.88 @xmath31/yr , or 3.38 @xmath31/yr when re - scaled with the salpeter imf which is consistent to the stellar mass measured in the sed fitting .",
    "the specific sfr @xmath32 gyr@xmath13 is typical of long grb host galaxies with log  @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure6.eps    ( 80mm,80mm)figure7.eps",
    "we have presented the results of the search for sn component associated with grb  100418a , with focas on subaru telescope .",
    "both imaging and spectroscopic observation show no evidence of sn .",
    "comparison of our @xmath34band magnitude to pre - burst data in sdss catalog puts upper limit on afterglow plus sn luminosity , @xmath35 .",
    "our spectrum shows no sn feature above noise level . assuming that the sn is fainter than the noise level",
    ", we estimate the upper limit on the sn to be @xmath36 ( 44005500    in the restframe ) .",
    "this limit is about 4 magnitude brighter compared to the case of grb  060505 and grb  060614 at @xmath37 , due to higher redshift of grb  100418a ( @xmath38 ) and brightness of the host galaxy .",
    "however , it is still comparable to faintest type ic sne including sn  2002ap which is the faintest broad lined type ic sn ever observed @xcite .",
    "we have also estimated properties of the host galaxy of grb  100418a .",
    "the results of the sed fitting and the emission line diagnostic show that the host galaxy has larger stellar mass and higher - metallicity than majority of long grb host galaxies at @xmath39 ( figure  [ fig : hostprop ] ) .",
    "it is notable that among three long grbs with significant limit on their sn component , two bursts occurred in galaxies with 12+log(o / h ) @xmath40 ( grb  060505 and grb  100418a ) .",
    "the other one burst grb  060614 occurred in a very faint galaxy @xcite , and metallicity of the host galaxy is not measured .",
    "@xcite reports possible detection of the sn component of grb  100418a at 28 days after the burst , which is faint and agrees with our upper limit .",
    "the possible sn association suggests that grb  100418a maybe originate from a collapsar .",
    "if their possible detection is a real event , the sn associated with grb  100418a is the faintest sn associated with a grb @xcite , except another possibly detected sn associated with grb  101225a ( @xcite , but see also @xcite ) .",
    "the specific sfr of the host galaxy of grb  100418a is comparable to other long grb host galaxies suggesting collapsar origin of this burst , while short grbs occur in galaxies with lower specific sfr than host galaxies of long bursts @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that a short grb ( xrf ) 050416 occurred in a galaxy with similar @xmath41 and sfr to the host galaxy of grb  100418a @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : epei ] , we show the spectral peak and the isotropic equivalent gamma - ray energy of grb  100418a @xcite together with those of grb  060505 , 060614 and other grbs at @xmath42 whose host galaxies are metal rich .",
    "grb  100418a and 060614 agree with the @xmath43@xmath44 relation of long grbs by @xcite , while grb  060505 is in upper - left of the relation where most short bursts reside @xcite .",
    "a caveat on this plot is that the @xmath43 of grb  100418a is calculated in @xcite using a relation between photon index in _ swift _ burst alert telescope and @xmath43 @xcite , which is not tested against short grbs .",
    "thus some observational features suggest grb  100418a originates from a collapsar , however none of them are conclusive .    the sample of long grbs without bright sne and long grbs in high - metallicity galaxies is still very small , and it is difficult to draw robust conclusions on their nature .",
    "however , localization of a long grb without a bright sn in a high - metallicity galaxy suggests some interesting possibilities .",
    "if long grbs without observable sne originate from collapsars similarly to grbs with hypernove , many of which occur in low - metallicity galaxies .",
    "the possible high - metallicity environments of long grbs without sn features suggest environmental effect on explosion scenario in which a collapsar produce no observable sn ( e.g. , a collapsar with a fallback sn , @xcite ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that metallicity of grb host galaxies maybe systematically different from that of direct environments of grbs @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that grbs associated with hypernovae and grbs without sn features belong to a continuous population , predicting the existence of grbs associated with sub - luminous or faint sne with the @xmath45ni mass @xmath46@xmath47 .",
    "the limit on the sn associated with grb  100418a based on the noise spectrum corresponds to 15% of the luminosity of sn  1998bw at the peak of its light curve ( figure  [ fig : snlimit ] ) . assuming that the mass of @xmath45ni in sn ejecta is proportional to the luminosity of the sn , the mass of @xmath45ni ejected from grb  100418a is @xmath48 ( the @xmath45ni mass ejected from grb  980425/sn  1998bw is @xmath49 , @xcite ) . in the jet - induced hypernova models by @xcite ,",
    "the ejected amount of @xmath45ni is smaller if the jet formation is slower so that the ram pressure of the jet is lower .      if the long grbs without observable sne occur from non - collapsar origin , many of the long grbs that occur in high - metallicity galaxy may be non - collapsar grbs . in the five grbs whose",
    "host galaxies have spectroscopically measured metallicity 12+log(o / h ) @xmath40 at @xmath42 , two are without sn component to significant limit , and the other three do nt have confirmed sn component .",
    "considering the claimed low - metallicity preference of the collapsar model ( @xcite ; see , however , @xcite ) , these observations suggests significant contamination of non - collapsar originate events [ e.g. , grbs originates in merger of double compact object binary , so called short grbs or type i grbs @xcite ] in the sample of @xmath9 sec grbs in high - metallicity galaxies , and possibly also those events in low - metallicity galaxies .",
