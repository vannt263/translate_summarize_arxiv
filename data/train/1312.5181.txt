    "in the following we describe the simulation methods employed as well as various technicalities pertaining to the calculation of some quantities",
    ". we also comment on the determination and quantitative accuracy of the temperature at which the domain wall - confined ferroelectric transition takes place , and on previous first - principles literature on the dws in pbtio@xmath0 .",
    "for most simulations we used the first - principles model for pto described in ref .  , where it is labeled `` @xmath3 '' .",
    "this model can be viewed as a taylor series of the energy , around the ideal cubic perovskite structure , as a function of all possible atomic distortions and strains .",
    "the series was truncated at 4th order and only pairwise interaction terms were included .",
    "the potential parameters were computed by using the local density approximation ( lda ) to density functional theory ( dft ) . to compensate for lda s well - known overbinding problem",
    ", we simulate the model under the action of a tensile hydrostatic pressure of 14.9  gpa .",
    "we ran some direct first - principles simulations to verify the model predictions at low temperatures .",
    "for that task , we used the pbesol@xcite approach to dft as implemented in the vasp package.@xcite note that the pbesol functional has been shown to render accurate results for the equilibrium structures of several fe perovskite oxides@xcite including pto ( which we checked ourselves ) .",
    "we used the `` projector augmented wave '' method to represent the ionic cores,@xcite solving for the following electrons : ti s 3@xmath51 , 3@xmath52 , and 4@xmath53 ; pb s 5@xmath52 , 6@xmath53 , and 6@xmath51 ; and o s 2@xmath53 and 2@xmath51 .",
    "wave functions were represented in a plane - wave basis truncated at 500  ev , and a 6@xmath66@xmath61 @xmath54-point grid was used for integrations within the brillouin zone corresponding to a 1@xmath61@xmath620 supercell . to better compare our model - potential and first - principles results , we conducted pbesol structural relaxations in both an unconstrained way [ `` pbesol ( i ) '' results in fig .  1 of our manuscript ] and by imposing lattice vectors obtained from model - potential calculations [ `` pbesol ( ii ) '' ] .    for the sake of comparison",
    ", we also ran some simulations at the lda level , all other technicalities being identical to those of our pbesol calculations .",
    "we computed the electric dipoles caused by the displacement of individual atoms within a linear approximation , using the corresponding dynamical charge tensors as computed for the cubic phase . to compute ti - centered local polarizations associated to specific cells , as those shown in fig .  1",
    ", we proceeded in the following way : we summed up the dipoles associated to the central titanium and to its nearest - neighboring atoms ( i.e. , 6 oxygens and 8 leads ) , weighting the contribution of the neighbors appropriately ( e.g. , since an oxygen atom is shared by two ti atoms , it contributes one half of its associated dipole to the polarization centered at each of its two neighboring titaniums ) .",
    "we proceeded analogously to compute pb - centered polarizations .",
    "this is a rather standard scheme@xcite related with the local - mode construction in classic first - principles models of ferroelectrics.@xcite    finally , we used a standard monte carlo ( mc ) scheme to account for the effect of temperature in our system , working with a periodically repeated box of 12@xmath612@xmath620 pto unit cells .",
    "at all temperatures we initialized our mc simulations from the multi - domain ground state configuration described in fig .  1",
    ". we typically ran 25,000  mc sweeps for thermalization , followed by at least 25,000 additional sweeps for computing thermal averages . in the region of the dw - confined phase transition , marked in red in fig .  3 of our manuscript , we did production runs of up to 150,000  mc sweeps , as needed to obtain acceptable statistics for @xmath55 . note that , because of the quasi - two - dimensional and strongly - fluctuating nature of the polar order at the walls , this was an especially challenging task ; in particular , as discussed below , our ability to get quantitatively accurate results in the critical region is limited by the size of the considered supercell , which is the largest we can afford with our current simulation tools . we also ran a simulation of the fe phase transition of pto , always in a mono - domain configuration , using a 12@xmath612@xmath612 simulation box periodically repeated . in this case",
    ", we always started the simulations from a perfectly cubic structure ; then we ran 10,000  mc sweeps for thermalization , followed by 50,000 sweeps for computing averages , which was enough to obtain well converged results at all temperatures .",
    "we checked that the temperature dependent mono - domain polarization thus computed is essentially identical to the local polarization obtained at the middle of the domains in our multi - domain simulations .",
    "whenever we needed to run a structural relaxation with our model potential , we performed mc simulated annealings in which we reduced the temperature down to essentially 0  k , allowing the simulation to evolve until the system would get _ frozen _ at an energy minimum . in some cases we started the annealings at very low temperatures , which allowed us to investigate local ( meta - stable ) minima of the energy , as the lack of thermal activation prevents the simulated system from evolving to its most stable configuration .",
    "this was important , for example , to compute the hysteresis loops of fig .",
    "2(a ) of our manuscript , as we needed to follow the evolution of the polar states , as a function of the magnitude of an opposing electric field , up to their meta - stability limit .",
    "beyond that limit , the local energy minimum is lost and the relaxation ( i.e. , the simulated annealing ) naturally evolves towards the polar state favored by the applied field . using the same strategy , we were also able to quantify the energy gap between the states with parallel and anti - parallel dw polarizations , and thus determine that the dw ",
    "dw interaction is negligible for the separating distance ( i.e. , 9 unit cells or about 35   ) corresponding to our simulation box .    ,",
    "the absolute value of the @xmath13 component of the dw polarization . from the inflection point of this curve , obtained numerically , we can estimate @xmath56  k. ]",
    "as already mentioned in the manuscript , at temperatures around the dw - confined transition our mc results are affected by the fact that our simulation supercell is finite in size .",
    "more specifically , we simulate dws that are composed of 12@xmath612 cells periodically repeated in the dw plane .",
    "while we have checked that a lateral size of 12  cells is sufficient to describe the bulk fe transition of pto with good accuracy , our results suggest that we may not be converged size - wise as regards the dw - confined transformation ( see fig .  3 of our manuscript ) .",
    "whenever one deals with low - dimensional orders , large amplitude fluctuations are more likely to occur , which complicates convergence with size .",
    "unfortunately , at present our software does not allow us to further increase the size of the simulation box , as the calculations become too heavy computationally .",
    "nevertheless , an analysis of the results obtained for 12@xmath612 dws allows us to bracket @xmath24 quite precisely .",
    "first of all , let us stress that the uncertainty caused by these size effects is of little practical importance .",
    "the affected temperature range is relatively small , approximately from 320  k to 350  k. hence , from the point of view of comparing our value of @xmath24 with an eventual experimental determination , the error coming from size effects can be considered negligible .",
    "there are simple and usually effective strategies to estimate the temperature dependence of the order parameter , from our mc data , in ways that are robust against size effects .",
    "thus , for example , if we are interested in the thermal average of the dw polarization @xmath57 , it is a good idea to compute the average of its absolute value , @xmath58 , instead . in this way ,",
    "spurious fluctuations ( i.e. , _ jumps _ between equivalent energy wells ) of the dw polarization , permitted by the finite size of the simulation box , will not result in a vanishing order parameter .",
    "an obvious drawback of this approach is that @xmath59 will be different from zero even in the disordered phase , which is not correct . yet , monitoring the temperature dependence of this quantity is usually enough to locate a phase transition , and even permits a quantitative estimation of the transition temperature .",
    "figure  s1 shows the results for @xmath58 from our mc simulations .",
    "as expected , we obtain a smooth temperature dependence that clearly points at a transition occurring in the range between 320  k and 350  k. further , we can estimate the transition temperature by numerically calculating the inflection point of this curve , which happens at about 332  k.    we were not fully satisfied by this simple estimate , and tried to analyze our mc data in more detail , proceeding as follows .",
    "figure  s2(a ) shows the computed @xmath18 evaluated at @xmath60 and as a function of temperature .",
    "there we can appreciate that at @xmath28  k the dws do not visit the @xmath60 state , as we have @xmath61 .",
    "hence , it is clear that our simulations predict @xmath62  k. above that temperature , there is a range in which we get very small but non - zero values of @xmath63 , as well as a bimodal shape for @xmath18 .",
    "do we really have disordered dws at these temperatures ?",
    "to gain insight into the behavior of the system in this temperature range , we considered several ways to compute the dielectric constant @xmath34 .",
    "let us recall that @xmath64 , and that we have @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the applied electric field , @xmath67 is the supercell volume , @xmath68 , @xmath69 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath70 denotes a thermal average as computed from our mc simulations .",
    "now , instead of using all the sweeps of our production mc runs to compute @xmath71 , it was instructive to consider smaller sets of data that we label by @xmath72 , compute the corresponding @xmath73 for each set , and perform a statistical analysis of the results .",
    "figure  s2(b ) summarizes the outcome of such an exercise .",
    "we show the results obtained by considering sets of data composed of 16,000  mc sweeps each .",
    "( we checked that 16,000  sweeps are typically sufficient to get well - converged thermal averages of our quantities of interests . ) if we approximate @xmath71 by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the number of 16,000-sweep sets that we have , we obtain the results shown by a solid black line and triangles in fig .",
    "interestingly , @xmath76 presents two peaks located at 320  k and 335  k , respectively . if , alternatively , we approximate @xmath71 by @xmath77 we get the results shown by a dashed black line and circles in fig .",
    "s2(b ) . in this case",
    ", we get a single broad peak with a maximum at @xmath78  k.    to understand the origin of these results , it is useful to look at the evolution of @xmath11 during the mc runs , as shown in figs .",
    "s2(c ) and s2(d ) for 335  k and 320  k , respectively . at 335  k",
    "we observe frequent fluctuations in the value of @xmath11 , suggesting that the dws are not ordered .",
    "( note that we have two dws in the simulation cell ; at 335  k we get @xmath79  c / m@xmath10 when the two dw polarizations are parallel , and @xmath80 when they are anti - parallel . )",
    "the fluctuations are large , which leads to a large response according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi ] ) and explains the peak that @xmath76 presents at that temperature . at the same time",
    ", it is possible to find relatively long segments of the mc run in which @xmath11 fluctuates around a constant value .",
    "hence , the computed @xmath81 is much smaller than @xmath76 .",
    "figure  s2(d ) shows that the situation at 320  k is very different . in this case , our dws clearly present a stable polarization .",
    "nevertheless , from time to time we do observe a jump in @xmath11 , indicating a switch in the polarization of one of the dws .",
    "these infrequent jumps lead to a very large value of @xmath76 , which peaks at that temperature .",
    "in contrast , we find that @xmath81 , which is obviously determined by a segment of the mc trajectory that is free of jumps in @xmath11 , takes a relatively small value . from this analysis",
    ", we can conclude that the peak observed at 320  k in @xmath76 is an artifact associated to the finite size of our simulation supercell , and that our results suggest that @xmath24 is about 335  k or 340  k. to generate the figures in our manuscript , we assumed @xmath82  k and processed our mc data accordingly .",
    "finally , let us note another feature of our results that is related with the finite size of our simulation box . in fig .",
    "4(b ) of our manuscript , the results for @xmath34 with a clear dw contribution extend only up to @xmath83  k , where a discontinuity can be appreciated .",
    "the reason is that above that temperature , because of the finite size our supercell , the initial multi - domain configuration evolves during the mc run into a mono - domain state , which is more stable for the elastic ( unconstrained ) and electrical ( short - circuit ) boundary conditions considered in our simulations .",
    "nevertheless , we do not observe any sort of structural order at the dws for @xmath84 , and have no reason to expect a different behavior at higher temperatures .",
    "hence , our current inability to investigate the dws up to @xmath38 is not troublesome .",
    "the largest quantitative uncertainty affecting our value for @xmath85 is surely related with the inaccuracies inherent to our first - principles model potentials . as shown in ref .",
    ", our potential for pto reproduces the energetics of the fe instabilities with very good accuracy , and it also accounts well for the lowest - energy perturbations of the relevant stable structures .",
    "hence , as far as the homogeneous fe phases of the material are concerned , our potential can be considered an accurate approximation to density functional theory ( dft ) results obtained using the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "however , the computed @xmath37  k turns out to be significantly smaller than the experimental value of 760  k , which suggests there is a problem with the accuracy of the lda and employed first - principles methods . as discussed in ref .",
    ", tracking down the origin of this error is not trivial ; the lda could be giving us ( 1 ) fe instabilities that are too weak , ( 2 ) afd instabilities that are too strong , ( 3 ) a fe - afd competition that is too strong , or ( 4 ) a combination of all these problems .",
    "all such errors will affect our calculation of @xmath24 in essentially the same way as they affect the calculation of @xmath38 .",
    "hence , we have reasons to believe that our model may underestimate significantly the temperature of the dw - confined transition .",
    "additionally , one may wonder whether our model reproduces the dft energetics associated with the dws as well as it captures those related with the bulk fe state .",
    "our model renders a dw energy @xmath86  mj / m@xmath10 when we allow for a full structural relaxation of the dw , and @xmath87  mj / m@xmath10 when we constrain the dw to remain in the unpolarized high - symmetry state . using the pbesol approach to dft [ which we denote `` pbesol  ( i ) '' in our manuscript ; see methods section ] , we get 149  mj / m@xmath10 and 152  mj / m@xmath10 , respectively , for these two quantities . when we run the pbesol relaxation imposing the cell strain obtained from our model calculations [ `` pbesol  ( ii ) '' ] , we get 225  mj / m@xmath10 and 250  mj / m@xmath10 , respectively . note that meyer and vanderbilt reported a value of 132  mj / m@xmath10 for this quantity,@xcite which they computed at the lda level and considering an unpolarized dw .",
    "thus , we can conclude that our model gives acceptable results for the dw energy , even though this piece of information was not used when calculating the potential parameters .",
    "( for reference , we ran lda calculations considering an unpolarized dw , as done in ref .  , and got a dw energy of 97  mj / m@xmath10 . )    for us it is more relevant to consider the energy difference between the paraelectric and ferroelectric states of the dw , i.e. , the depth of the energy well corresponding to case  iii in fig .",
    "2(b ) of our manuscript .",
    "for this quantity we get 86  mev / cell with our model , 4  mev / cell at the `` pbesol  ( i ) '' level , and 26  mev / cell at the `` pbesol  ( ii ) '' level .",
    "it is interesting to note that , despite the good agreement for the dw polarization and structure between our model and the pbesol calculations [ see fig .",
    "1(c ) ] , the differences in energy are large .",
    "this comparison suggests that , with respect to the result one would obtain from a pbesol simulation , our model may overestimate significantly the value of @xmath24 . [ for reference , we also computed the depth of the energy well corresponding to the dw - confined fe instability at the lda level , and obtained 6  mev / cell when a full structural relaxation is allowed , and 45  mev / cell when the cell obtained from our model - potential simulations is imposed . hence , lda renders slightly stronger dw - confined instabilities than pbesol . ]",
    "how worrisome are the differences between our model and pbesol energetics as regards the dw order ?",
    "how well would a pbesol simulation reproduce the @xmath38 of the fe transition occurring in the bulk of pto ? is pbesol the best dft flavor available for this task ?",
    "it is not possible to answer those questions at present . as an indication ,",
    "let us mention that our pbesol calculations render a value of 67  mev / cell for the energy difference between the bulk - paraelectric and bulk - ferroelectric phases of pto .",
    "this value corresponds to the depth of the energy well of case  i in fig .",
    "2(b ) , for which we get 189  mev / cell using our model .",
    "hence , since our model underestimates pto s experimental @xmath38 quite significantly , we can tentatively conclude that a pbesol simulation would lead to very small curie temperature for this material .",
    "hence , despite its accuracy at predicting equilibrium structures , it is not clear at all whether pbesol should be our dft method of choice for calculating the energetics of pto s fe instabilities .",
    "we hope this discussion illustrates the difficulties involved in assessing the accuracy of dft , and dft - based methods , as regards the calculation of transition temperatures in materials with non - trivial structural and lattice - dynamical effects like pto .",
    "as mentioned , we have reasons to think that our result for @xmath24 might be smaller than the experimental value , and we also have reasons to think it might be larger . at any rate , the existence of a dw - confined polar order and temperature - driven transition remains a solid prediction .",
    "as mentioned in our paper , there are several first - principles studies of the 180@xmath2 dws of pto available in the literature  @xcite . interestingly , except for the earliest one,@xcite all of them suggest that no polar order occurs within the dw plane",
    ". we can not be sure about the reasons why these previous works did not find polarized dws , but some possibilities are worth mentioning .",
    "first , it is usual in studies of this sort to assume a simplification of the dw structure , typically imposing that the symmetry operations that are common to the two neighboring domains be preserved in the structural relaxations .",
    "such an approximation , which is adopted to alleviate the computational cost of the simulations , may well render a null dw polarization .",
    "second , we obtained our polar dw configurations from mc annealings based on our pto potential , which allowed us to explore the configuration space very efficiently , and used such structures as the starting point of the first - principles relaxations . in our experience , one",
    "is not guaranteed to reach such a distorted structure in a typical first - principles optimization , which would start from the non - polar dw state , even if all symmetries are broken .",
    "( note that the information on the energetics of the dw instability , given in section  iii above , may be relevant to this issue . )",
    "let us also note that , recently , wei _",
    "et al_. @xcite have found polar distortions at the structural ( antiphase ) dws of non - polar compound pbzro@xmath0 .",
    "et al_. present first - principles results showing the bi - stability of the polar dw configuration , and thus argue that such a polarization is switchable .",
    "however , the supplemental material of ref .   suggests that the switch of the dw polarization also involves the reversal of structural distortions _ inside _ the domains .",
    "this is reminiscent of the so - called _ hybrid improper ferroelectrics _  where the polarization switch must be accompanied by the reversal of one additional order parameter @xcite  and of the polar order predicted at the fs walls of catio@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the polarization of our pto dws can switch without affecting the surrounding domains .",

    "<S> [ fig1 ] , the strain disfavors the occurrence of a dw polarization along the @xmath13 direction , which is subject to a compression . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2](b ) : case  i corresponds to the full development of the fe distortion of pto , as it happens within the domains . case  ii corresponds to the development of a three - dimensional @xmath13-polarized state when we constrain the cell to be strained as in the @xmath7-polarized fe state ; the equilibrium polarization and associated energy gain get clearly reduced , and we obtain a value of @xmath11 ( about 0.75  c / m@xmath10 ) that is not far from our result at the dw center ( about 0.65  c / m@xmath10 ) . additionally , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) shows a case  iii corresponding to the condensation of @xmath11 at our dws ; the energy well becomes shallower than in case  ii , indicating a further weakening of the polar instability caused by the spatial confinement ( i.e. , by the truncation of interactions favoring the three - dimensional homogeneous polar state ) and the competition with the @xmath8 distortion of the neighboring domains . </S>",

    "<S> the total response ( black line and circles ) is split in two parts : ( 1 ) the response of an @xmath7-polarized mono - domain state ( dashed blue line ) ; note that this response does not saturate , as the @xmath8 polarization will eventually rotate to align with the field . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1](b ) and [ fig1](c ) , the agreement between our model - potential and first - principles results is very good , and the fe character of pto s dws is confirmed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we should note that there are several first - principles studies of the 180@xmath2 dws of pto in the literature  @xcite , and the consensus is that no dw - confined polarization occurs . </S>",
    "<S> we can not be sure about the reasons why these previous works did not find polarized dws ; some possibilities are discussed in @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> e.g. , a ( 011 ) boundary separating domains with @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 $ ]  present polar distortions analogous to the one just described . in contrast , we found that 90@xmath2 dws do not present any fe instability , a result probably related with the fact that these boundaries are considerably more distorted than their 180@xmath2 counterparts , or to the elastic ( epitaxial tensile ) constraints we had to impose in order to stabilize them . </S>",
    "<S> pto s 90@xmath2 dws will be discussed elsewhere .    finally , let us note that the low - temperature configuration of our pto dws can be described as being bloch - like . </S>",
    "<S> first - principles theory has predicted the occurence of bloch - like dw configurations in materials like linbo@xmath0 @xcite and batio@xmath0 in its rhombohedral phase @xcite .    _ behavior with temperature_. we studied pto dws as a function of increasing temperature by running mc simulations as described in @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> ( 2 ) for @xmath20  k the dw gets disordered and we have a null thermal average @xmath21 . at those temperatures the system presents a mirror symmetry plane perpendicular to the @xmath13 axis , and we could say that the dws are in a _ paraelectric </S>",
    "<S> _ state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) finally , for 320  k  @xmath22  350  k we have a narrow region in which , during the course of the mc simulation , @xmath23 occasionally switches between equivalent polar states . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the finite size of our simulation supercell is partly responsible for such fluctuations , which should be considered a spurious finite size effect below a certain transition temperature @xmath24 . at any rate , </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a phase transition is obvious from these results , and the analysis of the mc data suggests that we have @xmath25  k. ( see @xcite for details . )     for the @xmath13-component of the polarization at the center of the dw and as a function of temperature . </S>",

    "<S> the left side of the histograms for @xmath30  k and @xmath31  k is drawn using dashed black lines ; this is to emphasize that , at these temperatures , we attribute the @xmath32 fluctuations from positive to negative values to finite size effects ( see @xcite ) . ]    , blue circles ) and at the center of the dws ( @xmath33 , red triangles ) . </S>",
    "<S> panel  ( b ) : diagonal components of the dielectric permittivity tensor . </S>",
    "<S> the discontinuity for @xmath34 ( triangles ) at @xmath35  k is related with the finite - size effects described in @xcite . ]    the phase transitions in our simulated system are clearly appreciated in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  [ fig4 ] , which shows the evolution of the relevant order parameters and dielectric response . </S>",
    "<S> as the system cools down from high @xmath36 , the diagonal components of the dielectric tensor increase sharply , revealing a fe transition at @xmath37  k. [ the quantitative disagreement between our computed @xmath38 and the experimental result for pto ( 760  k ) is discussed in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> ] note that for @xmath39  k we have @xmath40 , reflecting the cubic symmetry of the paraelectric phase . </S>",
    "<S> then , for @xmath41 the @xmath34 component [ triangles in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) ] behaves in an anomalous way . </S>",
    "<S> as regards the dielectric response along the @xmath13 direction , our multi - domain configuration can be viewed as a set of parallel capacitors , so that the total dielectric constant can be split into domain and dw contributions , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the respective volume fractions . </S>",
    "<S> noting that @xmath45 and @xmath46 in our case , and that @xmath47 is featureless for @xmath48 ( which we checked by running mc simulations of the mono - domain case ) , it is clear that the increase in @xmath34 comes from a very large dw response @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the dw - confined transition is driven by a fe soft mode and characterized by very strong fluctuations of the order parameter , as consistent with the reduced dimensionality .    </S>",
    "<S> _ final remarks_. as mentioned , the possibility of having polar orders and dielectric anomalies associated with dws has been discussed in the theoretical literature , typically employing phenomenological continuum models @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our first - principles work corroborates that such effects can indeed occur , providing for the first time a realistic atomistic picture of a @xmath36-driven dw - confined ferroic transformation .    </S>",
    "<S> one might describe the found transition as a change in the dw character , from bloch to ising , upon heating ; in fact , some authors have discussed similar effects in these terms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , we think that our result is better described as a proper fe phase transition confined to the dw , to emphasize that it results in a switchable dw polarization . for the same reasons </S>",
    "<S> , we would rather denote the low - temperature state as a ferroelectric dw , and not simply as a dw with bloch - like character . </S>",
    "<S> note that , as in the case of linbo@xmath0 @xcite , bloch - like dws may not display a net polarization .    </S>",
    "<S> the present results are the first step in the investigation of such an interesting phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> aspects for future work include : the possible critical behavior of the transition , the pre - transitional dynamics , the internal structure of the dws ( can we have multi - domain states within them ? ) , and the role of dw  dw interactions ( can it affect the dimensionality and features of the transition ? ) . </S>",
    "<S> we thus believe our findings will open exciting research avenues in the fields of phase transitions and low - dimensional physics .    </S>",
    "<S> it may seem surprising that the predicted effect has not been reported experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> however , note that observing such a fe order may require some uncommon measurements . </S>",
    "<S> ideally , one would like to work with samples presenting a pattern of highly - ordered stripe domains separated by 180@xmath2 dws , as displayed by suitably grown pto films @xcite and pto / sto superlattices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> high - resolution x - ray measurements at low temperatures may reveal the dw order . additionally , by measuring the dielectric response along the in - plane direction of the dws , one should be able to observe a clear feature around @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> we hope our results will motivate further experimental work to characterize fe dws and the transitions that may occur within them .    </S>",
