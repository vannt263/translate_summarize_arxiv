    "helioseismic inversions of global acoustic oscillation frequencies reveal two striking rotational boundary layers at the upper and lower edges of the solar convective envelope @xcite . throughout the bulk of the convection zone , the angular velocity @xmath1 decreases by about 30% between the equator and latitudes of @xmath2 , with conical isosurfaces such that the gradient is primarily latitudinal .",
    "substantial radial gradients in @xmath1 occur only near the base of the convection zone ( @xmath3 , with @xmath4 as the solar radius ) where the super - adiabatic stratification of the envelope meets the sub - adiabatic stratification of the radiative interior , and in the surface layers ( @xmath5 ) where deep convection meets the heirarchy of smaller - scale convective motions sustained by radiative cooling in the photosphere @xcite .",
    "the lower boundary layer is known as the solar tachocline and is thought to play an essential role in regulating the dynamical coupling between the convection zone and the radiative interior and in generating the large - scale magnetic fields that underlie the solar activity cycle @xcite . the upper boundary layer , known as the near - surface shear layer ( nssl ) , is similarly complex and enigmatic .",
    "its existence must arise from nonlinear feedbacks among turbulent convective motions spanning vastly disparate spatial and temporal scales with correspondingly different sensitivities to the rotation , density stratification , and spherical geometry .",
    "although somewhat less celebrated than the tachocline , the nssl is more accessible to helioseismic probing and as such , provides a unique window into the dynamics of the solar convection zone .",
    "the higher resolution of the helioseismic inversion kernals near the surface allows for a more reliable determination of the rotational gradients .",
    "even more significantly , local helioseismic inversions enable a determination of the meridional flow throughout much of the nssl to a degree that is not possible in the tachocline .",
    "together with photospheric doppler and tracer measurements , such inversions indicate a meridional flow that is highly variable but systematically poleward @xcite .",
    "@xcite has recently suggested that the dynamics that give rise to the poleward meridional flow at the solar surface occur entirely within the nssl .",
    "this conclusion is based on estimates for the subsurface meridional flow obtained from correlation tracking of surface features .",
    "these suggest that the poleward surface flow reverses near the base of the nssl , with equatorward counter - flow at a depth of 35 mm below the photosphere ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this is in contrast to previous estimates based on local helioseismology , which suggest that the poleward flow persists throughout the upper convection zone , with the return flow required by mass conservatation occuring well below 0.95 @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "if confirmed , hathaway attributes this relatively shallow meridional flow structure to supergranulation .",
    "more specifically , the existence of the nssl has long been attributed to the tendency for photospheric convection ( on scales of supergranulation and smaller ) to conserve angular momentum locally , with fluid parcels spinning up and spinning down as they move toward and away from the rotation axis respectively @xcite .",
    "such behavior is often found in numerical simulations of rotating convection when the rotational influence is weak , such that the convective turnover time scale is much less than the rotation period @xcite .",
    "this condition is well satisfied in the solar surface layers where turnover time scales associated with granulation and supergranulation are of order a day or less and the average rotation period is 28 days .",
    "although the conservation of angular momentum is a valid interpretation of the numerical experiments , it alone can not account for the existence of the nssl ; there must be more to the story . as we will demonstrate here , meridional forces play an essential role in determining the angular velocity profile in the nssl , regardless of the nature of the convective angular momentum transport .",
    "furthermore , as we will also demonstrate , the angular velocity profile of the nssl inferred from helioseismic inversions is not consistent with angular momentum homegenization .",
    "in this paper we propose that the poleward meridional flow in the nssl is closely linked to the inward @xmath1 gradient . the physical mechanism underlying",
    "this link is what we refer to as _",
    "gyroscopic pumping _",
    ", whereby a zonal forcing ( axial torque ) induces a meridional flow as a consequence of dynamical equilibration mediated by the inertia of the mean flows ( i.e.  the coriolis force ) . in  [ sec : gp ] and  [ sec : meridional ] we discuss the dynamical balances that are likely to be achieved in the nssl and in  [ sec : helio ] we exploit these dynamical balances in order to estimate the characteristics and efficiency of turbulent transport .",
    "then , in  [ sec : transport ] we consider these results from the perspective of two simple theoretical paradigms .",
    "we summarize our results and conclusions in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we wish to emphasize from the outset that we are interested in how mean flows , namely differential rotation and meridional circulation , respond to turbulent stresses in the solar nssl that are currently unknown .",
    "thus , in expressing the relevant dynamical balances we will write terms involving the inertia of the mean flows ( including the coriolis force ) explicitly .",
    "meanwhile , we will incorporate turbulent stresses by means of two relatively generic terms , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , introduced in sections [ sec : concepts ] and [ sec : zonvort ] ( see also appendix a ) .",
    "the reader who values specificity may regard @xmath7 and @xmath8 as an embodiment of the convective reynolds stress , with explicit expressions given in appendix a. this is likely to be the dominant contribution in the solar nssl .",
    "however , by leaving these terms unspecified we wish to highlight the generality of the physical processes we consider .",
    "thus , the maxwell stress and the large - scale lorentz force in stars and the artificial viscous diffusion in numerical simulations can establish mean flows in much the same way .",
    "we begin our investigation of the dynamical balances in the nssl with the standard ( compressible ) equations of magnetohydrodynamics ( see appendix a ) , alternating throughout between spherical polar coordinates ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) and cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath12 , @xmath11 , @xmath13 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath14 is the cylindrical radius and @xmath15 is the coordinate parallel to the rotation axis ( each with corresponding unit vectors , e.g.  @xmath16 ) .",
    "an equation for the conservation of angular momentum can be readily obtained by multiplying the zonal ( @xmath11 ) component of the momentum equation by the moment arm , @xmath12 , and then averaging over longitude and time ( denoted by angular brackets @xmath17 ) .",
    "this yields @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mass density and @xmath20 is the bulk velocity , including meridional and zonal components ; @xmath21 .",
    "the term @xmath7 incorporates all non - axisymmetric , magnetic , and viscous effects , as described further below and in appendix a. thus , we refer to it as the net axial torque .",
    "however , if magnetic fields and viscous diffusion are neglected , @xmath7 has only one component , and that is the reynolds stress .",
    "we use an inertial ( non - rotating ) coordinate system so the angular velocity is given by @xmath22 and the specific angular momentum is @xmath23 .",
    "the meridional velocity can be expressed in spherical and cylindrical coordinates as @xmath24 .",
    "if we assume a statistically stationary state equation ( [ eq : amom ] ) becomes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath25 furthermore , if we assume that there is negligible mass flux through the solar surface , then a steady solution is only possible if @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the volume of the entire solar interior @xmath28 .",
    "we emphasize that equations ( [ eq : amom ] ) and ( [ eq : gp ] ) are valid for any arbitrary value of the rossby number .",
    "they follow directly from the mhd equations , as demonstrated in appendix a. the left - hand - side includes all terms involving the inertia of the mean flow and the right - hand - side .",
    "@xmath7 , is dominated by the reynolds stress .",
    "more specifically , the left - hand - side of equation ( [ eq : gp ] ) repesents the advection of angular momentum by the mean meridional circulation and the right - hand - side incorporates all other forces , most notably the convective reynolds stress and the lorentz force .",
    "molecular viscosity can also contribute to the net torque @xmath7 but this is expected to be negligible in stars .",
    "any imbalance between the forces that contribute to @xmath7 will induce a meridional flow @xmath29 across @xmath30 isosurfaces .",
    "although @xmath1 contours are nearly radial in the bulk of the solar convection zone , @xmath30 contours are nearly cylindrical , as demonstrated in figure 1 , increasing away from the rotation axis such that @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "thus , equation ( [ eq : gp ] ) implies that a retrograde torque @xmath33 will induce a flow toward the rotation axis while a prograde torque @xmath34 will induce a flow away from the rotation axis .",
    "this is the concept of gyroscopic pumping discussed by mcintyre ( 1998 , 2007 ; see also haynes et al .",
    "1991 , garaud & acevedo arreguin 2009 , and garaud & bodenheimer 2010 ) .",
    "thus , we refer to equation ( [ eq : gp ] ) as the gyroscopic pumping equation .",
    "the process by which equation ( [ eq : gp ] ) is established will be addressed in  [ sec : meridional ] . here",
    "we focus on its implications . to proceed ,",
    "we assume that the mass flux is divergenceless , @xmath35 .",
    "this can be justified with the anelastic approximation but that is not necessary ; a non - divergent mean mass flux follows directly from the compressible mass continuity equation under the assumption of a statistically stationary state .",
    "we may then define a streamfunction @xmath36 such that @xmath37    if the @xmath30 contours are cylindrical , as expressed in equation ( [ eq : cylindrical ] ) , then @xmath36 follows directly from equations ( [ eq : gp ] ) and ( [ eq : psidef ] ) : @xmath38 where @xmath39 . in obtaining equation ( [ eq : psisoln ] )",
    "we have assumed that there is no mass flux through the photosphere so @xmath40 at @xmath41 .",
    "thus , @xmath36 is obtained by integrating along a cylindrical surface , beginning at the photosphere in the northern hemisphere ( @xmath42 ) and proceeding in the negative @xmath13 direction , through the equatorial plane , and continuing to the photospheric boundary in the southern hemisphere ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "an appreciation for how gyroscopic pumping operates is best obtained by considering the simplest case in which the differential rotation is weak .",
    "this limit is satisfied if @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the rossby number associated with the differential rotation , and @xmath46 is some measure of the variation of the rotation rate with latitude and radius ( a rigorous derivation of the limit yields @xmath47 ) .",
    "this criterion is approximately satistied in the sun ; helioseismic inversions indicate @xmath48 . in the low rossby number limit",
    ", the uniform rotation component @xmath49 dominates the angular momentum gradient and @xmath50 .",
    "substituting this into ( [ eq : psisoln ] ) then yields @xmath36 for a given @xmath7 .",
    "this simple example emphasizes an important point : here , the net _ zonal _ force ( encompassed in the net axial torque @xmath7 ) determines the _ meridional _ flow , _ not _ necessarily the differential rotation . for",
    "a given @xmath7 , equation ( [ eq : gp ] ) provides a direct link between the meridional flow and the turbulent angular momentum transport , valid to lowest order in the rossby number ( which is assumed to be small ) .",
    "the differential rotation is determined by other mechanisms , as discussed in  [ sec : clarify ] ,  [ sec : meridional ] , and  [ sec : transport ] .",
    "an idealized demonstration of how this works is given in appendix b.    note also that a cylindrical torque @xmath51 is ruled out by equation ( [ eq : psisoln ] ) .",
    "this would imply a cylindrical mass flux @xmath52 that is independent of @xmath13 , which is in turn ruled out by mass conservation and our requirement that there be no flow through the surface @xmath41 .",
    "more explicitly , we can say that if the @xmath30 profile is cylindrical [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : cylindrical ] ) ] , then a steady meridional flow is only possible if @xmath53 . in other words",
    ", the meridional flow responds mainly to the axial variation of the torque , @xmath54 .",
    "the amplitude of the resulting @xmath55 is proportional to @xmath7 and inversely proportional to @xmath49 ; for a given rotation rate , the stronger the zonal force , the stronger the meridional flow that is induced .    for finite values of @xmath56 equation ( [ eq : gp ] ) must still hold in a steady state but the contribution of the differential rotation to @xmath57 can not be neglected .",
    "the meridional circulation will redistribute angular momentum so @xmath30 will depend on @xmath36 and the gyroscopic pumping equation is nonlinear even if @xmath7 is fixed .",
    "linear and nonlinear feedbacks of @xmath1 and @xmath36 on @xmath7 complicate the problem further .",
    "a unique solution requires consideration of the meridional momentum and energy equations , as well as mean flow profiles that adjust in order to minimimize the net axial torque @xmath7 .",
    "we address these issues in  [ sec : clarify ] and  [ sec : meridional ] below .",
    "as emphasized in the last paragraph of  [ sec : concepts ] , the gyroscopic pumping equation ( [ eq : gp ] ) is robust .",
    "it holds for any arbitrary value of the rossby number provided there exist well - defined , persistent mean flows .",
    "furthermore , @xmath57 is undeniably directed away from the rotation axis in the nssl , as revealed by global helioseismic inversions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dr]@xmath58 ) .",
    "thus , the sense and amplitude of the meridional flow is linked to the net axial torque @xmath7 . however , as also noted in  [ sec : concepts ] , this link is in general nonlinear and depends on factors other than the angular momentum transport . in this section",
    "we discuss some of the subtlties involved .",
    "we begin with equation ( [ eq : psisoln ] ) , which rests on the approximation of a cylindrical angular momentum profile , as expressed in equation ( [ eq : cylindrical ] ) .",
    "although this is an instructive example with relevance to the sun ( cf .",
    "[ fig : dr]@xmath58 ) , the concept of gyroscopic pumping is more general and applies straightforwardly to other scenarios as well . in general , the meridional flow through @xmath30 isosurfaces is linked to the net axial torque @xmath7 while the flow along @xmath30 isosurfaces follows from mass conservation .",
    "the integral in equation ( [ eq : psisoln ] ) for @xmath36 would then proceed along @xmath30 isosurfaces .",
    "another issue mentioned in  [",
    "sec : concepts ] concerns the dependence of the net axial torque @xmath7 on the mean flows and the possibility that the mean flows adjust to minimize @xmath7 .",
    "in some circumstances , this dependence may be regarded in terms of a differential operator that operates on the mean rotation profile : @xmath59 .",
    "an example is the case of turbulent diffusion , in which the angular momentum flux is proportional to @xmath60 , as discussed in  [",
    "sec : transport ] . in this case",
    ", the gyroscopic pumping equation ( [ eq : gp ] ) , admits a homogeneous solution as well as a particular solution . in other words , we may write @xmath61 where @xmath62 this decomposition is only rigorously valid if the operator is linear and if the dependence of the angular momentum advection @xmath63 on @xmath1 is linearized in some way ( e.g.  for @xmath44 ) .",
    "even so , it serves to illustrate intuitively how the nature of @xmath7 has implications for the differential rotation as well as for the meridional circulation . even in the absence of meridional flow , the solution to the homogeneous equation @xmath64 may in general exhibit a differential rotation that depends on the nature of the operator and the boundary conditions .",
    "examples are given in ",
    "[ sec : homo ] .    yet",
    ", the basic premise of gyroscopic pumping is still valid , namely that a net axial torque @xmath65 can only be sustained in a steady state if angular momentum is continually replenished by advection from the surrounding fluid .",
    "the meridional flow , differential rotation , and turbulent stresses will adjust until this is achieved .",
    "meridional and zonal forces both play a role in this nonlinear dynamical adjustment as described in  [ sec : thex ] and contribute to the mean flow profiles that are ultimately realized .",
    "still , the nearly cylindrical @xmath30 profile revealed by helioseismology ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dr]@xmath58 ) provides a robust link between the meridional flow and the net zonal forcing , expressed in equation ( [ eq : gp ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the prominent axial @xmath1 gradient @xmath66 revealed by helioseismic inversions provides a robust link between the rotational shear and the meridional forcing , as addressed in  [ sec : meridional ] .",
    "such non - intuitive links between meridional / zonal flows and zonal / meridional forcing are mediated by the coriolis force so they are most prominent in rapidly rotating systems .",
    "however , their robustness applies even in the solar nssl where the rossby number based on convection is large (  [ sec : implications ] ) .",
    "another important point about gyroscopic pumping is that it is inherently a _ non - local _ process . a localized torque @xmath7 will in general induce a global circulation , extending far beyond the forcing region @xcite",
    "this has particular significance with regard to the problem of tachocline confinement , whereby gyroscopic pumping in the convection zone induces a circulation that burrows downward into the radiative interior with time unless other physical processes suppress it @xcite .",
    "likewise , zonal forces in the nssl have potential implications for mean meridional and zonal flows throughout the convection zone . for a demonstration of how a local zonal force in the nssl can induce a global meridional flow , see the analytic example presented in appendix b.    yet , the coupling between the bulk of the convection zone ( cz ) and the nssl will also work the other way .",
    "namely , there must be a net torque in the convection zone @xmath67 that induces a meridional flow by gyroscopic pumping that will extend into the nssl .",
    "furthermore , given the relatively large mass and energy content of the cz relative to the nssl , we may expect this meridional flow to overwhelm that which is driven by net axial torques within the nssl , @xmath68 . in order to account for the solar differential rotation",
    ", the sense of the deep - seated angular momentum transport must be such that @xmath69 is positive at low latitudes and negative at high latitudes .",
    "this will induce a counter - clockwise circulation in the northern hemisphere via eq .",
    "( [ eq : gp ] ) that will pump mass flux into the nssl , maintaining a poleward flow even in the absence of any turbulent stresses within the nssl itself .",
    "however , if @xmath70 were indeed zero , then this cz circulation would redistribute angular momentum until the @xmath30 contours aligned with the streamlines of the meridional flow such that @xmath71 .",
    "this is clearly not the case in the sun , where the meridional flow is poleward and the @xmath30 contours are nearly cylindrical ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dr]@xmath58 ) .",
    "the meridional flow clearly crosses @xmath30 isosurfaces , so @xmath68 must be nonzero .    in short , gyroscopic",
    "pumping by net axial torques in the deep convection zone may contribute to the poleward flow in the nssl but angular momentum transport within the nssl itself must also play a role .",
    "this is consistent with the mean - field simulations of @xcite who considered the maintenance of mean flows in the solar interior based on idealized parameterizations for the turbulent momentum and energy transport .",
    "he found poleward meridional flow near the solar surface even without a nssl .",
    "when he included an inward ( cf .",
    " [ sec : anisotropy ] ) angular momentum transport in a thin layer near the surface , he found both an nssl - like shear layer where @xmath72 as well as an enhancement of the poleward flow .",
    "in light of the discussion in  [ sec : concepts ] and  [ sec : clarify ] , the implications of equation ( [ eq : gp ] ) for the solar nssl are clear .",
    "the same physical mechanism responsible for the deceleration of the rotation rate in the solar surface layers inferred from helioseismology ( @xmath73 ) is also responsible for the poleward meridional flow inferred from helioseismic and doppler measurements ( @xmath74 in the northern hemisphere ) .",
    "the underlying cause of both phenomena is a retrograde net axial torque ( zonal force ) @xmath7 which is most likely due to a divergence in the angular momentum transport by the convective reynolds stress .",
    "its localization near the solar surface ( resulting in a large @xmath75 that effectively generates a meridional flow ) is in turn a likely consequence of the rapidly changing length and time scales of convection , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the influence of rotation on convection is typically quantified by the rossby number based on the convective time scales @xmath78 ( as opposed to @xmath56 above ) .",
    "estimates for giant cells ( @xmath79 1020 days , @xmath80 0.10.2 ) and granulation ( @xmath81 min , @xmath82 ) suggest that @xmath83 should cross unity somewhere in the vicinity of the lower nssl , likely signifying a qualitative change in convective transport .",
    "thus , in this section we have established that a net retrograde zonal force @xmath33 in the nssl will induce a poleward meridional flow .",
    "this is a very general result , independent of the nature of @xmath7 , which we address in  [ sec : transport ] . before proceeding to this ,",
    "however , we discuss another general and important maxim ; a net axial torque @xmath7 can not in itself account for the existence of the nssl .",
    "again , this conclusion is completely independent of the nature of @xmath7 and follows essentially from the taylor - proudman theorem .",
    "coriolis - induced meridional flows will tend to eliminate all axial rotational shear @xmath84 _ regardless _ of the amplitude and structure of the zonal forcing .",
    "thus , the axial shear @xmath84 in the nssl must be determined not by convective angular momentum transport @xmath7 but rather by turbulent and baroclinic stresses in the meridional plane , which we now address (  [ sec : meridional ] ) .",
    "in  [ sec : concepts ] we discussed how a net axial torque @xmath7 can induce a meridional circulation through the gyroscopic pumping equation ( [ eq : gp ] ) but we said little about how this balance is achieved .",
    "we also left open the question of how the differential rotation profile is established , particularly in the low rossby number limit ( @xmath44 ) when @xmath7 is directly linked to the meridional flow through eq .",
    "( [ eq : psisoln ] ) .    to address these issues for any arbitrary value of the rossby number",
    ", we must also consider the meridional components of the momentum equation . exploiting the divergenceless nature of the mean mass flux @xmath85",
    ", we can combine these two equations into one by considering the zonal component of the curl ; in other words , the zonal vorticity equation , averaged over longitude and time .",
    "in order to illustrate how the system adjusts in response to specified forcing scenarios , we will temporarily retain the time derivative and write this equation as follows : @xmath86 the vorticity is defined as @xmath87 , with @xmath88 as the zonal component .",
    "we emphasize that equation ( [ eq : mer ] ) is valid for any arbitrary value of the rossby number , as demonstrated in appendix a. the first term on the right - hand side includes the complete inertia of the mean zonal flow , including uniform ( coriolis ) and differential rotation components .",
    "this is followed by the baroclinic term @xmath89 where @xmath19 is the density as before and @xmath90 is the pressure .",
    "the final term on the right - hand - side of equation ( [ eq : mer ] ) , @xmath8 , represents turbulent stresses in the meridional plane . as with the net axial torque @xmath7 , @xmath8 includes the reynolds stress , the lorentz force , and the viscous diffusion",
    "we have also included in @xmath8 baroclinic contributions associated with thermal fluctuations , e.g.  @xmath91 .",
    "an explicit expression for @xmath8 is given in appendix a , along with the derivation of equation ( [ eq : mer ] ) .",
    "we now describe a simple thought experiment in order to illustrate several important points about gyroscopic pumping and to gain an intuitive feel for how it operates within the context of the nssl . we stress that this is an idealized example intended to illustrate fundamental physical principles , namely that some meridional forcing is needed to account for the existence of the nssl .",
    "we then proceed to discuss the nature of this meridional forcing in  3.3 .",
    "consider a rotating spherical volume of radius @xmath4 subject to a specified net axial torque @xmath7 that turns on at some instant @xmath92 .",
    "in analogy to the nssl , we will assume that @xmath33 in a thin layer near the surface , say @xmath93 . to be explicit",
    ", we can set @xmath94 ( see  [ sec : homo ] ) . in order to allow the system to eventually reach an equilibrium state",
    ", we assume that the net ( integrated ) torque in the convection zone is positive , such that @xmath7 satisfies equation ( [ eq : notorque ] ) .    for simplicity we will assume that the baroclinic and turbulent stresses in the meridional plane vanish , so @xmath95 .",
    "this corresponds to a flow that is axisymmetric , non - magnetic , non - diffusive , and adiabatic .",
    "furthermore , we assume that @xmath64 for @xmath96 .",
    "thus , before time @xmath97 , the system can sustain an initial equilibrium state with a cylindrical rotation profile @xmath98 and no meridional flow , @xmath99 ( satisfying the taylor - proudman theorem ; see , e.g.  pedlosky 1987 ) .",
    "in analogy with the sun , we assume that the equator rotates faster than the poles , so @xmath100 .",
    "it follows also that the angular momentum increases outward , @xmath101 and is cylindrical ( @xmath102 ) , as expressed in equation ( [ eq : cylindrical ] ) .",
    "this initial equilibrium satisfies equations ( [ eq : gp ] ) and ( [ eq : mer ] ) , with @xmath103 .    now turn on the torque @xmath7 at @xmath92 .",
    "how does the system respond ?",
    "initially , the torque will slow down the rotation rate in the nssl , tilting the @xmath1 contours away from the rotation axis .",
    "this will produce an axial rotation gradient @xmath104 which will in turn induce a counter - clockwise meridional circulation in the northern hemisphere ( negative @xmath105 ) according to equation ( [ eq : mer ] ) .",
    "in other words , there will be a poleward flow in the nssl and a net equatorward return flow in the deeper convection zone to ensure mass conservation .",
    "this induced meridional flow will redistribute angular momentum , altering the @xmath1 profile . in the nssl , angular momentum will be advected from low latitudes toward the poles , accelerating the rotation rate , accompanied by a deceleration of the deeper convection zone .",
    "this will proceed until a new , final equilibrium is reached , again with a cylindrical rotation profile @xmath106 .",
    "the new profile will be different from the initial profile ( @xmath107 ) , with cylindrical isorotation surfaces shifted away from the rotation axis ( positive @xmath16 direction ) .",
    "furthermore , the torque @xmath7 will sustain a steady , nonzero meridional circulation @xmath108 , given by equation ( [ eq : psisoln ] ) , with poleward flow in the nssl and an equatorward return flow in the deep cz .    in summary , the response of the system to a retrograde zonal torque @xmath7 localized in the nssl is to establish a poleward flow that will increase in amplitude until the prograde angular momentum advected into the layer from the deep cz balances the retrograde angular momentum imparted by the torque .",
    "the meridional flow is predominantly poleward ( @xmath109 ) rather than cylindrically inward ( @xmath110 ) because of the thin radial extent of the nssl ( see appendix b for a demonstration ) .",
    "meanwhile , the rotation profile is altered but still cylindrical , @xmath106 .",
    "this simple thought experiment illustrates two important points .",
    "gyroscopic pumping is mediated by the coriolis force but the two phenomena are not equivalent_. the meridional components of the coriolis force can in principle vanish ( for the special case of @xmath111 = constant ) while the system still sustains a gyroscopically - pumped meridional circulation .",
    "more generally , for any cylindrical rotation profile @xmath112 , the meridional components of the coriolis force are opposed by pressure gradients ( geostrophic balance ) so they impart no zonal vorticity and thus no meridional momentum .",
    "the meridional flow is determined not by the coriolis force ( which responds to @xmath1 ) , but rather by the conservation of angular momentum ( which responds to @xmath7 ) .",
    "the second point is even more important : _ the mere existence of a retrograde torque @xmath7 does not guarantee the presence of a near - surface shear layer_. as stated in the introduction , even if the concept is valid , angular momentum conservation by turbulent convection alone can not account for the existence of the nssl . in the absence of baroclinic , turbulent , or magnetic stresses in the meridional plane ( @xmath95 ) , the meridional circulation will wipe out all axial shear @xmath84 , _ regardless of the nature , magnitude or profile of the convective angular momentum transport _ ( embodied by @xmath7 ) .",
    "the robustness of cylindrical rotation profiles is a consequence of the taylor - proudman theorem ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "no matter how strong @xmath7 is , a commensurate meridional circulation will suppress axial shear on a time scale comparable to the rotation period ( @xmath0 28 days ) .",
    "the prominent axial shear @xmath84 exhibited by helioseismic rotation inversions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dr]@xmath113 ) then implies that some meridional forcing , either baroclinic or `` turbulent '' , @xmath114 or @xmath8 , is necessary to account for the existence of the nssl as well as the detailed structure of the inferred @xmath1 profile .      in this section",
    "we argue that the existence and location of the nssl can be attributed to a qualitative change in the meridional force balance , marked by a transition from baroclinic to turbulent stresses ; @xmath114 to @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , it is the meridional stresses ( @xmath8 and/or @xmath114 ) rather than the angular momentum transport that largly determine the slope of the @xmath1 profile ( although the negative sign of @xmath115 still requires a retrograde net axial torque @xmath33 ) .",
    "although there are still some subtle uncertainties regarding the underying dynamics , recent global solar convection simulations and mean - field models have converged on a consistent paradigm whereby the nearly radial angular velocity contours ( conical @xmath1 isosurfaces ) at mid - latitudes in the deep cz are attributed to baroclinic forcing @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the gravitational acceleration , @xmath118 is the specific entropy , and @xmath119 is the specific heat at constant pressure @xcite .",
    "this is referred to as thermal wind balance @xcite .",
    "the convective reynolds stress is still necessary to account for the amplitude and sense of the angular velocity contrast between equator and pole , @xmath46 , but without baroclinicity , models generally yield cylindrical ( taylor - proudman ) profiles , in contrast to the conical profiles inferred from helioseismic inversions ( fig .

    "however , recent models have demonstrated that thermal coupling to the subadiabatic portion of the tachocline by means of a gyroscopically - pumped meridional circulation may contribute to establishing the requisite thermal gradients @xcite .    in any case , the nature and prominence of the baroclinic term in convection simulations and mean - field models hinges on the low effective rossby number in the deep cz . by",
    "_ effective _ rossby number we are referring to the amplitude of the meridional components of the convective reynolds stress relative to the deflection of the differential rotation by the coriolis force and the baroclinic forcing .",
    "however , as noted in ",
    "[ sec : implications ] , the rossby number rises steadily with radius in the convection zone , becoming much greater than unity in the nssl .",
    "this alone suggests that the turbulent stresses , represented by @xmath8 , may overwhelm the baroclinic term @xmath114 in the solar surface layers .",
    "_ in fact , this shift in the meridional force balance ( from @xmath114 to @xmath8 ) may mark the base of the nssl even more significantly than a change in the turbulent angular momentum transport @xmath7 .",
    "_    thus , we propose that in the nssl thermal wind balance , equation ( [ eq : tw ] ) is replaced by @xmath120 the implication would then be that _ turbulent stresses in the meridional plane , @xmath8 , largely determine the differential rotation profile in the nssl_. this hypothesis is consistent with global simulations of solar convection which , although they do not yet reproduce the nssl , do exhibit a departure from thermal wind balance in the surface layers above @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "this departure is attributed to a combination of resolved convective reynolds stresses and modeled sub - grid scale diffusion , both captured in our turbulent transport term @xmath8 . achieving a nssl in global convection simulations will likely require a reliable representation of turbulent transport by unresolved ( subgrid - scale ) motions , as discussed in ",

    "one way to estimate the amplitude of @xmath114 , at least in principle , is by means of helioseismic structure inversions .",
    "the thermal gradients that give rise to @xmath114 imply aspherical sound speed variations .",
    "if these gradients are to balance the axial shear in the rotation rate through baroclinic torques as expressed in equation ( [ eq : tw ] ) , then their relative amplitude must be of order @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the entropy variation from equator to pole .",

    "@xcite have reported aspherical sound speed variations much larger than this , of order @xmath126@xmath127 , but the amplitude of the variations peaks near the base of the convection zone at high latitudes , where the reliability of the inversions is questionable .",
    "if these inversions are indeed valid and if they do indeed trace thermal gradients as opposed to magnetic effects , then thermal wind balance , equation ( [ eq : tw ] ) would not be satisfied and turbulent stresses @xmath8 would have to contribute to the meridional force balance throughout the deep convection zone as well as the nssl .",
    "more work is needed to set stricter limits on aspherical sound speed variations from helioseismic structure inversions and whether they are consistent with helioseismic rotational inversions within the context of thermal wind balance .",
    "for now we regard the issue as not yet settled .",
    "an independent estimate for @xmath114 near the solar surface can ( again , in principle ) be obtained from photospheric irradiance measurements .",
    "the final equality in equation ( [ eq : tw ] ) , expressing @xmath114 in terms of the latitudinal entropy gradient , applies for an ideal gas equation of state and a nearly hydrostatic , adiabatic stratification ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the baroclinic term can be expressed in terms of the photospheric temperature variation from equator to pole , @xmath128 .",
    "if this is to balance the coriolis term @xmath129 , then we must have relative temperature variations of the same order as in equation ( [ eq : svar ] ) : @xmath130 we have again assumed an ideal gas equation of state and hydrostatic balance for simplicity .",
    "if we further assume that the solar irradiance arises from blackbody emission , then we should expect to see a corresponding latitudinal variation of the irradiance .",
    "in other words , if the solar differential rotation in the nssl were indeed in thermal wind balance [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : tw ] ) ] , then we would expect the poles to be brighter than the equator with a relative irradiance enhancement of @xmath131 .",
    "this corresponds to a temperature difference of about @xmath132k .",
    "irradiance variations of at least this order have indeed been detected ( reviewed by * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , recent measurments by @xcite indicate that the poles are indeed brighter than the equator , with @xmath133 . however , whether or not these can be interpreted as temperature variations is questionable .",
    "there is a strong possibility that the irradiance variation arises instead from unresolved magnetic flux elements .",
    "thus , we view current estimates of @xmath114 based on photospheric irradiance measurements as inconclusive as well .",
    "the essential question is whether @xmath114 can keep up with the sharp increase in @xmath66 throughout the nssl .",
    "the answer depends on the details of convective heat transport in the solar surface layers , which are not well understood .",
    "if convection acts as a turbulent thermal diffusion , then the thin shell geometry implies that the latitudinal temperature gradient ( @xmath128 ) at the base of the nssl , @xmath134 , might be efficiently transmitted to the surface .",
    "the rapid decrease of the background temperature with radius might then lead to an enhancement of the relative latitudinal temperature gradient @xmath135 , which in turn would imply an increase in @xmath114 [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : tvar ] ) ] .",
    "however , the horizontal heat transport and poleward meridional flow would tend to suppress latitudinal thermal gradients ( @xmath128 ) and thus diminish @xmath114 .    to approach this issue more quantitatively",
    ", we estimate from helioseisimic inversions (  [ sec : helio ] ) that @xmath129 is a factor of 5 - 10 larger at the surface than at the base of the nssl , @xmath136 ( defined as where the mean radial @xmath1 gradient changes sign ; see  [ sec : homo ] ) . over that same radial range",
    "the background temperature decreases by a factor of 30 - 40 .",
    "thus , taking into account also the variation of @xmath117 and @xmath9 , we estimate that horizontal transport would have to be at least three times more efficient than vertical transport in order for the magnitude of @xmath114 to increase less rapidly than @xmath129 , assuming thermal wind balance at @xmath137 and that the photosphere is an isobaric surface , as in equation ( [ eq : tvar ] ) .",
    "we may expect the ratio of horizontal to vertical turbulent diffusion to scale as @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are typical velocity and length scales and @xmath141 and @xmath142 denote horizonal and vertical directions .",
    "mass conservation , @xmath143 implies @xmath144 , so @xmath145 .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that this ratio may indeed exceed three for solar surface convection .",
    "for example , if we put in numbers for granulation , @xmath146 1 mm and @xmath147 300 km , where @xmath148 is the density scale height , then @xmath149 10 .",
    "this helps to substantiate the conjecture that baroclinic forces may be too weak to balance the coriolis force associated with the differential rotation in the nssl .    in summary , we suggest that the characteristic change in the slope of the @xmath1 profile that defines the nssl is largely determined by a shift in the meridional force balance from baroclinic to turbulent stresses ; that is , from equation ( [ eq : tw ] ) to equation ( [ eq : cg ] ) .",
    "although this hypothesis is in principle testable , we believe that current data is insufficient to either confirm or deny it . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we assume that this transition does indeed occur and we explore its implications with regard to the dynamics of the nssl .",
    "note also that the statements made in this section apply mainly to the persistent , background component of the mean flow that is present throughout the solar cycle .",
    "the baroclinic term @xmath114 may well establish time - varying meridional and zonal flows such as the low - latitude branch of the solar torsional oscillation as discussed by @xcite and @xcite . in the spruit - rempel model ,",
    "enhanced cooling in magnetically active latitudinal bands induces converging meridional flows that in turn accelerate zonal flows by means of the coriolis force .",
    "if the cooling is sustained for at least several months ( long enough for the coriolis force to fully respond ) , then the dynamical balances in equation ( [ eq : gp ] ) and ( [ eq : tw ] ) can be established in a quasi - static sense . as for the persistent background flow",
    ", the coupled inertia of the fluctuating flow components provides a tight link between the meridional circulation and the rotational shear .",
    "in  [ sec : gp ] and  [ sec : meridional ] we argued that the dynamical balances that are likely to prevail in the nssl are given by equations ( [ eq : gp ] ) and ( [ eq : cg ] ) .",
    "the left - hand side of each of these equations involves quantities that are accessible to helioseismic inversions , namely @xmath1 and @xmath150 .",
    "thus , if we assume these balances hold , then we can obtain observational estimates for the turbulent stresses @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "that is the focus of this section .",
    "we will obtain estimates for the turbulent stresses @xmath7 and @xmath8 based on local and global helioseismic inversions and we will discuss their implications for the nature of turbulent transport in the nssl . then , in  [ sec : transport ] we will investigate whether these results are consistent with simple theoretical models .",
    "we begin in  [ sec : data ] by discussing the data we use and we then proceed to calculate @xmath7 and @xmath8 in  [ sec : fghelio ] .",
    "we use both local and global helioseismic procedures to estimate the solar rotation rate @xmath1 and the meridional flow component @xmath151 .",
    "both techniques exploit the fact that , through the doppler effect , a flow induces a frequency splitting between acoustic waves propagating in opposite directions . by measuring this frequency splitting for a variety of waves that reside within different regions of the solar interior , through an inversion process",
    ", maps of the flow as a function of latitude and depth can be produced .",
    "global helioseismology employs modes of long horizontal wavelength that comprise the sun s global acoustic resonances .",
    "the frequency splittings of such modes can be used to measure the axisymmetric component of the rotation rate over a broad range of latitudes ( within @xmath152 of the equator ) and to depths spanning the entire convection zone .",
    "local helioseismic techniques , which measure short - wavelength waves , do not permit sampling of the flows to such high latitudes or to such large depths ( only within @xmath153 of the equator and only within the upper 15 mm or 2% by fractional radius ) ; however , local helioseismology is capable of measuring both the rotation rate and the meridional component of the flow , unlike global helioseismology .",
    "we utilize a local helioseismic procedure called ring analysis which assesses the speed and direction of subsurface horizontal flows by measuring the advection of ambient acoustic waves by those flows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "measurement of the frequency splitting provides a direct measure of the fluid s flow velocity in those layers where the waves have significant amplitude .",
    "the frequency shift induced by the flow on any given wave component is given by @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the wave s horizontal wavenumber and @xmath156 is the integral over depth of the horizontal flow velocity weighted by a kernel which is approximately the kinetic energy density of the acoustic wave .",
    "the frequency splittings for a large number of waves of different wavenumber and radial mode order form a system of integral equations that can be inverted to obtain the horizontal flow as a function of depth @xcite . by repeating the analysis over many different locations on the solar surface and over many different days , a map of the horizontal flow as a function of longitude , latitude , depth and time can be generated .",
    "our local helioseismic inferences were made using dopplergram data from the michelson doppler imager ( mdi ) aboard the solar and heliospheric observer ( soho ) .",
    "flows have been obtained using the dynamics campaign data , of which 2 - 3 months of data per year is available .",
    "we have chosen to use data from the rising phase of the solar cycle from 1996 through 2003 .",
    "the short - wavelength waves used by local helioseismic procedures are trapped near the solar surface , and the ring - analysis measurements used here are therefore capable of sampling down to a depth of 15 mm below the photosphere , or the upper half of the nssl .",
    "each local analysis samples a region of sun that is roughly 180 mm ( 15@xmath157 in heliographic angle ) in diameter . on any given day ,",
    "a mosaic of 189 overlapping analysis regions are independently analyzed , resulting in a flow map with a horizontal spacing of 7.5@xmath157 between measurement regions , each with a horizontal resolution of 15@xmath157 .",
    "estimates for the mean rotation rate @xmath1 and the latitudinal component of the meridional flow @xmath158 , have been obtained by averaging the resultant maps over all longitudes and over the 2 - 3 months that the dynamics campaign data is available each year .",
    "the mean rotation rate @xmath1 is illustrated in figure [ fig : omega_helio ] .",
    "the black curve corresponds to measurements made in 1996 , while the blue diamonds show the weak variability in the flows during the years 1997 to 2003 .",
    "the latitudinal component of the flow , @xmath158 , is shown in figure [ fig : vth_helio ] at two different depths and with a differently - colored curve for each year .",
    "the global helioseismic assessments were made using four non - overlapping 60 day intervals of gong data from the year 1996 @xcite .",
    "the rotation rate is inferred from the frequency splitting between modes of equal but opposite azimuthal order @xmath159 .",
    "such modes are identical in all respects other than the fact that they propagate in opposite directions in longitude around the sun .",
    "solar rotation doppler shifts the mode frequencies in opposite directions and the frequency splittings of many different modes can be inverted to obtain the rotation rate as a function of latitude and depth .",
    "the result of a regularized least squares ( rls ) inversion is shown in figures [ fig : dr ] and [ fig : omega_helio ] .",
    "if we assume the dynamical balances in equations ( [ eq : gp ] ) and ( [ eq : cg ] ) hold , then we can turn them around and calculate @xmath7 and @xmath8 based on helioseismic inversions .",

    "we first fit the @xmath1 profile to a functional form given by @xmath164 and then compute the @xmath10 gradient analytically .",
    "we then compute the radial @xmath1 gradient by means of a second - order finite difference scheme ( on a non - uniform grid ) applied to the fitting coefficients @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 .",
    "the estimation of @xmath168 from equation ( [ eq : ghelio ] ) involves correlations between the mean meridional and zonal flow . for these we use the local inversions described in  [ sec : data ] .",
    "in particular , we fit the local @xmath1 inversion to a functional form as in equation ( [ eq : omega ] ) and the local @xmath158 inversion ( both from 1996 ) to a functional form given by @xmath169 the fits to the local @xmath1 and @xmath158 inversions are plotted in figures [ fig : vth_helio ] and [ fig : omega_helio ] as red dashed lines .",
    "the global @xmath1 fit lies almost on top of these other curves and is thus omitted for clarity .",
    "the mean radial velocity @xmath170 is obtained by assuming mass conservation ; @xmath35 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the spherically - symmetric mean density given by solar structure model s of @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath173 the @xmath10 derivative on the right - hand - side of equation ( [ eq : vreq ] ) is computed analytically from the fit in equation ( [ eq : vtfit ] ) .",
    "this leads to the following form for @xmath170 @xmath174 we then proceed by expressing the radial derivative on the right - hand - side of equation ( [ eq : vreq ] ) by means of a second - order finite difference scheme and we solve the resulting matrix equations for @xmath175 ( @xmath176 = @xmath177 , 2 , 4 ) , with boundary conditions such that @xmath178 at @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath179 are then smoothed using a boxcar window , taking into account the non - uniform grid .",
    "the resulting @xmath170 profile is shown in figure [ fig : vr ] for several radii .",
    "note that the amplitude of the inferred radial velocity is extremely small in the nssl , less than 1 m s@xmath180 and its contribution to @xmath7 ( and @xmath168 ) is negligible .",
    "it does contribute a small positive maximum at the equator ( @xmath181 @xmath182 s@xmath180 ) as seen in figure [ fig : fg]@xmath113 , but the prominent maximum at mid - latitudes is due almost entirely to the final term in equation ( [ eq : fhelio ] ) , proportional to @xmath183 .",
    "although there is some uncertainty in the estimation of @xmath170 (  [ sec : variability ] ) , we believe this conclusion is robust . in order for the radial component to make a significant contribution to @xmath7",
    ", the radial velocity would have to be at least an order of magnitude larger than our estimate .",
    "this would imply either a latitudinal velocity that is an order of magnitude larger , of order 200 m s@xmath180 , or a latitudinal gradient of @xmath158 that is an order of magnitude larger .",
    "if the amplitude of the meridional flow is to be no larger than 20 m s@xmath180 , the requisite gradient would require that the peak flow be achieved within 3 degrees of the equator .",
    "both scenarios can be ruled out by surface observations and helioseismic inversions .    both @xmath7 and @xmath8 peak at mid - latitudes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fg ] ) because this is where @xmath66 and @xmath183 peak .",
    "in fact , these two terms ( @xmath66 and @xmath183 ) are identically zero at the equator because of the symmetry implied by equations ( [ eq : omega ] ) and ( [ eq : vtfit ] ) . as emphasized in  [ sec : anisotropy ] , this does not mean that the local angular and meridional momentum flux must vanish at the equator , nor must the mean shear .",
    "rather , it implies that the turbulent transport and the mean flows adjust themselves in such a way as to minimize the net zonal flux divergence ( axial torque ) @xmath7 and the net meridional `` force curl '' @xmath8 .",
    "this is in contrast to mid - latitudes , where the net zonal and meridional momentum transport represented by @xmath7 and @xmath8 must be nonzero in order to balance the inertial forces associated with the mean differential rotation and meridional circulation .",
    "this delicate , nonlinear , nonlocal interplay between turbulent transport and mean flows ultimately determines the structure of the nssl .",
    "note that the sign of @xmath7 ( and @xmath168 ) is negative at mid - latitudes , signifying that turbulent stresses must exert a retrograde net axial torque , removing the angular momentum that is imparted by the meridional flow .",
    "the sign of @xmath8 , meanwhile , is positive , tending to induce a clockwise circulation in the northern hemisphere in order to offset the counter - clockwise circulation that would tend to establish a cylindrical ( taylor - proudman ) rotation profile (  [ sec : thex ] ) .",
    "the quantities plotted in figure [ fig : fg ] , @xmath184 and @xmath8 , represent turbulent ( non - axisymmetric ) zonal and meridional momentum transport but a direct comparison between them is somewhat elusive since they apply in different contexts ; @xmath7 appears in the angular momentum equation while @xmath8 appears in the zonal vorticity equation ; their units are different . in this section",
    "we put @xmath7 and @xmath8 on an equal footing by converting them to accelerations , with units of cm s@xmath185 .",

    "now consider again our dynamical balance equations ( [ eq : gp ] ) and ( [ eq : cg ] ) .",
    "the left - hand - side of both of these equations arises from the first term on the right - hand - side of equation ( [ eq : mom ] ) , namely the inertia associated with mean flows ( we use an inertial reference frame so the coriolis force is included in this term as well ; see appx .",

    "the helioseismic estimate of @xmath8 is obtained from the zonal vorticity equation and therefore provides no information about the compressible component , @xmath192 . however , taking the curl of equation ( [ eq : mom ] ) yields an equation for @xmath191 : @xmath193 we solve this equation as described in appendix c , subject to boundary conditions such that the radial acceleration vanish at the surface ( @xmath194 at @xmath41 ) , and the latitudinal acceleration vanish at the base of the nssl ( @xmath195 at @xmath134 ) .",

    "here @xmath210 is the work done against the angular velocity gradient and @xmath212 is the work done by means of transporting angular momentum through the surface @xmath223 . in a stationary state",
    "the mean mass flux is divergenceless , so equation ( [ eq : gp ] ) implies @xmath225 .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath210 and @xmath212 are listed in table 1 and indicate that the latter dominates @xmath208 , accounting for its negative sign .",
    "thus , most of the work done by turbulent stresses to maintain the nssl against advection by the meridional flow involves transporting angular momentum out of the layer .",
    "our estimate for the angular momentum flux , @xmath226 , also allows us to compute a spin - down time scale for the nssl : @xmath227 as indicated in table 1 , this suggest a value of about 200 days for the region spanned by the local inversions and about 590 days for the entire nssl .",
    "this is comparable to the ventilation time @xmath228 where @xmath229 20 m s@xmath180 is a typical meridional flow amplitude .",
    "this correspondence is not surprising since we estimated the turbulent angular momentum flux @xmath226 based on the meridional flow .      as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] and as demonstrated in ",
    "[ sec : data ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vth_helio ] ) , estimates of the meridional flow based on different observational data sets and different analysis techniques can vary substantially .",
    "some of this variability can be attributed to measurement uncertainities but some is undoubtedly due to the intrinsic variability of the flow itself .",
    "in addition to the meridional flow , equations ( [ eq : gp ] ) and ( [ eq : mer ] ) also involve gradients in the angular velocity @xmath1 which are also subject to measurement uncertainties and intrinsic variability . in this section",
    "we address what implications this variability and uncertainty has with regard to the principle arguments , results , and conclusions presented in this paper .",
    "we begin with the physical processes discussed in sections [ sec : gp ] and [ sec : meridional ] .",
    "the predominant dynamical balances we advocate for the nssl , represented by equations ( [ eq : gp ] ) and ( [ eq : cg ] ) , are expected to hold regardless of the detailed amplitude and structure of the mean flows .",
    "they assume only that well - defined , persistent zonal and meridional flows exist when averaged over time intervals longer than a rotation period ( of order one month ) and that turbulent ( i.e.  reynolds ) stresses dominate over baroclinic forces ( @xmath230 ) in the nssl .",
    "global rotational inversions indicate that variations in @xmath1 over the solar cycle are not more than a few percent @xcite .",
    "although @xmath1 gradients may vary more than this ( see below ) , they are not large enough to reverse the sign of @xmath231 . in order to do so , relative variations in the rotation rate @xmath232 would have to exceed @xmath233 where @xmath234 is the length scale of the shear . taking @xmath234 to be the extent of the nssl @xmath235 implies variations with time of the zonal flow of at least several hundred m s@xmath180 .",
    "such large temporal variations can be ruled out based on photospheric observations and helioseismic rotational inversions ( torsional oscillations are more like 20 m s@xmath180 ) . likewise , the uncertainty in @xmath19 ( obtained from model s ) is constrained by helioseismic structure inversions and is thus certain to within a few percent .",
    "thus , the principle source of uncertainty in the quantitative estimates presented in sections [ sec : fghelio ] and [ sec : anen ] is the meridional flow .",
    "relative to zonal flow inversions , meridional flow inversions are subject to both greater measurement errors and greater intrinsic variability , by virtue of their weaker amplitude and asymmetric structure with respect to the equator ( which precludes global inversions ) .",
    "note that this source of uncertainty only effects our estimate for @xmath7 and related quantities such as @xmath168 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fg]@xmath113 , @xmath198 in figures [ fig : gyan2d]@xmath236 and [ fig : gyan ] , and @xmath208 , @xmath210 , @xmath212 , and @xmath213 in table 1 .",
    "our estimate for @xmath8 and related quantities ( @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath203 , @xmath206 ) depends only on global rotation inversions , which are generally more reliable , particularly at high latitudes and large depths below the photosphere .    as noted in ",
    "[ sec : fghelio ] , the radial flow @xmath170 makes a negligible contribution to our estimate of @xmath7 , even when the variability and uncertainty in the meridional inversion is taken into account .",
    "we have verified that this is consistent with our data by computing @xmath168 for each of the years shown in figures [ fig : omega_helio ] and [ fig : vth_helio ] ( 1996 - 2004 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the radial component never exceeds 2@xmath237",
    "@xmath182 s@xmath180 , which is 5% of the saturation value of the color scale used in figure [ fig : fg]@xmath113 .",
    "the average amplitude is less than one percent of this saturation value .",
    "the time variation of our @xmath158 inversions varies greatly with latitude and depth , as shown in figure [ fig : vth_helio ] . at latitudes less than 40@xmath157",
    "the standard deviation of these measurements is less than 50% .",
    "this is also the case for our estimate of @xmath168 , confirming that @xmath158 is the principle source of uncertainty and variation . at latitudes greater than 40@xmath157 and radii below 0.99@xmath4",
    "the inversions become less reliable and the standard deviation exceeds 50% .",
    "however , we remind the reader that our quantitative estimates for @xmath7 and related quantities in [ sec : fghelio ] and [ sec : anen ] are based on an analytic fit to the 1996 inversions , as shown by the dashed line in [ fig : vth_helio ] ( 1996 - 2004 ) . this is a smooth poleward flow with an amplitude of 18 - 21 m s@xmath180 at all measured radii @xmath214 .",
    "although the amplitude of this flow is debatable , this general profile is consistent with the inpretation put forth by several authors who have argued that the spatial and temporal variation of the meridional flow can be interpreted as a persistent poleward background flow plus a time - dependent component associated with cyclic magnetic activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we are interested mainly in the background flow which is present throughout the solar cycle and is most prominent during solar minimum .",
    "we emphasize that time averages of at least 2 - 3 months are needed to properly assess the mean flows we are concerned with here .",
    "that is the time scale over which the dynamical balances in equations ( [ eq : gp ] ) and ( [ eq : cg ] ) are established by means of the coriolis force .",
    "estimates of the meridional flow vary significantly from one carrington rotation to the next , independent of the measurement technique . for example , the results of hathaway & rightmire ( 2010 ) based on feature tracking indicate that the amplitude of the dominant legendre component can change by as much as 5 m s@xmath180 over the course of one year .",
    "if one includes the higher - order components , the variation can be even larger , of order 5 - 10 m s@xmath180 at the higher latitudes .",
    "the importance of temporal averaging is evident when comparing our meridional flow inversions to those of basu & antia ( 2010 ) , which are based on the same mdi data sets but each averaged over a single carrington rotation .",
    "the natural variability in our measurements should be reduced from those of basu & antia by roughly a factor of 1.5 just due to our longer averages .",
    "furthermore , our estimates are obtained by averaging over both longitude and time . at",
    "any given instant in time , we make 189 separate flow determinations scattered across the solar disk . all measurements made at the same latitude are then averaged together ( 15 determinations at the equator and 7 at the highest latitudes ) . the process is repeated on a daily basis and the results further averaged in time .",
    "basu & antia , on the other hand , only make estimates along the central meridian .",
    "so at high latitudes , even if the two teams average over a similar duration , we have 7 times more data going into the average . this high degree of temporal variability is the reason we used a representative smooth fit to the helioseismic measurements instead of directly using the measurements themselves .    according to our inversions ,",
    "the amplitude of the background poleward flow is approximately 20 m s@xmath180 .",
    "other estimates based on various techniques including heliseismic inversions , doppler measurements , and feature tracking generally range from 10 - 20 m s@xmath180 @xcite . if the mean meridional flow velocity were more like 10 m s@xmath180 as suggested by feature tracking ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then our quantitative estimates for @xmath168 in figure [ fig : fg]@xmath113 and @xmath198 in figures [ fig : gyan2d]@xmath236 and [ fig : gyan ] would be a factor of two too large .",
    "furthermore , if the actual amplitude of @xmath158 were to drop to zero near the base of the nssl as suggested by @xcite , then our extrapolated values for @xmath208 , @xmath210 , and @xmath212 listed in table 1 would be overestimated .    with these variations and uncertainties in mind ,",
    "we believe that our quantitative estimate for @xmath208 given in  [ sec : anen ] is reasonable .",
    "in particular , since the meridional flow speed @xmath158 is not likely to exceed 20 m s@xmath180 through much of the nssl ( @xmath238 ) , then the extrapolated value of @xmath208 is unlikely to exceed four percent of the solar luminosity , @xmath140 . moreover , since the average value of @xmath158 throughout the nssl ( @xmath238 ) is not likely to be much less than 10 m s@xmath180 , then @xmath208 is unlikely to be less than 1 - 2 percent of @xmath140 .",
    "our estimate for @xmath8 is based solely on global rotation inversions from 1996 .",
    "still , we can use the local inversions for the zonal flow shown in figure [ fig : omega_helio ] to estimate the temporal variation .",
    "this yields a standard deviation of less than 15% for latitudes less than 40@xmath157 .",
    "the maximum standard deviation at the highest latitudes measured , 52.5@xmath157 is 34% .",
    "this may be regarded as an upper limit to the uncertainty in the quantitative estimates for @xmath8 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath203 , and @xmath206 in sections [ sec : fghelio ] and [ sec : anen ] .",
    "we do not consider the time variation of global rotation inversions here but we expect they would imply smaller variations of @xmath8 by virtue of their greater accuracy at higher latitudes and lower radii .",
    "perhaps the simplest paradigm one can envision to potentially account for the existence of the nssl is that of turbulent diffusion .",
    "in particular , one might suppose that as the length and time scales of the convection decrease drastically approaching the photosphere from below , the effects of rotation and spherical geometry become unimportant , so the convection becomes more homogeneous and isotropic , at least in the horizontal dimensions .",
    "furthermore , given the small scale of the convective motions relative to the scale of the differential rotation and meridional circulation , one might expect them to suppress shear .",
    "the decrease in @xmath1 near the surface may then be attributed to the vanishing of the coriolis - induced velocity correlations that sustain the differential rotation deeper in the convection zone ( in mean - field parlance , this would be the non - diffusive component of the reynolds stress tensor , known as the @xmath239-effect ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the nssl would then be maintained by the outward diffusion of angular momentum from the deep convection zone together with the advection of angular momentum by the meridional flow .",
    "is this paradigm consistent with observations ?",
    "an alternative paradigm introduced briefly in  [ sec : intro ] , is that photospheric convection tends to conserve angular momentum locally .",
    "this has been found repeatedly in numerical simulations of rotating convection in parameter regimes with weak rotational influence ( high rossby number , see : * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in the absence of external forcing or boundary influences",
    ", turbulent mixing tends to establish a rotation profile such that @xmath30 is uniform throughout the domain in question ( @xmath240 ) .",
    "this is particularly evident in the recent simulations by @xcite that employ open boundary conditions in the vertical , permitting convective motions to pass through the boundaries .    in this section",
    "we consider these two paradigms for turbulent transport and investigate whether they are consistent with the helioseismic inversions discussed in ",
    "[ sec : helio ] .",
    "we will focus primarily on the angular momentum transport , represented by @xmath7 , and its implications with regard to the @xmath1 profile .",
    "however , we emphasize again that the @xmath1 profiles considered here can only be maintained with the help of corresponding meridional forces @xmath8 or @xmath114 ; these meridional forces are _ required _ to maintain rotational shear @xmath84 _ regardless _ of the nature of @xmath7 .    for both paradigms",
    ", we express the net axial torque in terms of the divergence of a turbulent angular momentum flux : @xmath221 .",
    "this is consistent with the hyperbolic nature of the compressible mhd equations and reliably captures the various components of @xmath7 , including the reynolds stress , lorentz force , and viscous diffusion ( appx .",
    "a ) .    in the case of turbulent diffusion , the form of the angular momentum flux",
    "@xmath226 is analogous to that for molecular diffusion but the effective turbulent viscosity @xmath241 is many orders of magnitude larger than the molecular value .",
    "this yields @xmath242 note that the direction of the angular momentum flux is down the gradient of @xmath1 , @xmath243 , tending to suppress rotational shear .",
    "by contrast , in our second paradigm , turbulence tends to mix angular momentum so we expect the flux to be down the gradient of @xmath30 : @xmath244 where @xmath245 .",
    "given the @xmath30 profile in figure 1@xmath58 , equation ( [ eq : fmx ] ) produces an angular momentum flux that is radially inward and poleward , as in high - rossby number convection simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we emphasize that the motivation for equation ( [ eq : fmx ] ) is purely phenomenological ; this form is suggested by simulations of turbulent convection at high rossby number . by contrast , equation ( [ eq : fvd ] ) can be derived rigorously through the techniques of mean - field theory , assuming scale separation and that small - scale motions are homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "we note also that the paper that introduced the concept of the near - surface shear layer , foukal & jokipii ( 1975 ; hereafter fj75 ) , touched on both paradigms .",
    "they represented the turbulent angular momentum flux as a viscous diffusion as in equation ( [ eq : fvd ] ) with a constant dynamic viscosity @xmath246 . substituting this into equation ( [ eq : gp ] ) and assuming a cylindrical rotation profile @xmath247 yields @xmath248 it is straightforward to show that this equation is the same as equation ( 1 ) in fj75 .",
    "they then consider the advection - dominated limit @xmath249 and argue that the flow will conserve angular momentum , yielding a profile @xmath30 = constant .",
    "however , it is important to note that fj75 attributed the conservation of angular momentum to the _ convection _ , not to the mean flow .",
    "if @xmath30 represents the axisymmetric zonal flow , then only the axisymmetric meridional flow @xmath250 ( assuming @xmath251 ) will contribute to the advection term on the left - hand - side ( lhs ) of equation ( [ eq : fj ] ) .",
    "thus , there are two ways to interpret the fj75 result within the context of the two paradigms considered here .",
    "the first interpretation is that the turbulent angular momentum flux is diffusive in nature [ eq .  ( [ eq : fvd ] ) ] and the homogenization of angular momentum @xmath252 constant is achieved by means of the meridional flow .",
    "the second interpretation is that the @xmath250 and @xmath253 terms on the lhs of equation ( [ eq : fj ] ) represent not mean flows but rather convection ; that is , replace the mean velocities with fluctuating velocities . when averaged over longitude and time",
    ", the net turbulent stress will then tend to homogenize @xmath30 , as expressed in ( [ eq : fmx ] ) .    yet , both interpretations are incomplete in the sense that they do not take into account the observed poleward merdional flow which clearly crosses @xmath30 contours as discussed in  [ sec : helio ]",
    ". the meridional flow does not conserve angular momentum on its own ( @xmath254 ) , nor does the convection ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "both must contribute to the subtle dynamical balances in the nssl .      in  [ sec :",
    "dm ] we suggested two potential idealized forms for the turbulent angular momentum flux , expressed in equations ( [ eq : fvd ] ) and ( [ eq : fmx ] ) .",
    "we now ask whether these paradigms are supported by helioseismic inversions . in this section",
    "we neglect the meridional flow and consider only the homogeneous solutions discussed in ",
    "[ sec : clarify ] , equation ( [ eq : homo ] ) .",
    "namely , we calculate the @xmath1 profile that would result in no net axial torque , @xmath64 and we ask whether this profile resembles the @xmath1 profile deduced from helioseismology .",
    "such solutions satisfy our zonal momentum equation ( [ eq : gp ] ) for @xmath255 , as they must if they are to describe a steady state .",
    "we consider the influence of a meridional flow in  [ sec : mflow ] .",
    "we begin with the case of turbulent diffusion and we assume for simplicity that the density - weighted ( dynamic ) diffusion coefficent @xmath246 is constant .",
    "anisotropic and inhomogeneous diffusion coefficients will be considered in  [ sec : anisotropy ] . from equation ( [ eq : fvd ] ) ,",
    "the condition @xmath64 then requires @xmath256 similarly , if we assume @xmath257 is constant , equation ( [ eq : fmx ] ) yields @xmath258    in order to obtain solutions to equations ( [ eq : vdeq ] ) and ( [ eq : mxeq ] ) we must specify boundary conditions . thus , to proceed , we must keep in mind the context in which these equations are proposed to be valid .",
    "they are intended to represent angular momentum transport in the nssl alone ; angular momentum in the deep convection zone ( cz ) must be very different in order to sustain the solar differential rotation .",
    "thus , to take into account the coupling between the nssl and the deep cz , we specify boundary conditions at the base of the nssl .",
    "it is often stated that the @xmath1 contours at mid latitudes in the bulk of the cz are nearly radial .",
    "close scrutiny of figure [ fig : dr]@xmath113 reveals that @xmath1 contours are not strictly radial ; rather , they are tilted slightly toward the rotation axis so @xmath259 in the bulk of the convection zone . however , in the nssl , @xmath260 .",
    "thus , we define the base of the nssl , @xmath261 , as the radius at which the spherically - averaged radial @xmath1 gradient passes through zero .",
    "this yields @xmath262 .",
    "thus , we solve equations ( [ eq : vdeq ] ) and ( [ eq : mxeq ] ) in the region @xmath93 , subject to the boundary conditions @xmath263 and @xmath264 at @xmath137 . here",
    "@xmath265 is an analytic fit as in equation ( [ eq : omega ] ) to the helioseismic inversions shown in figure [ fig : dr ] , interpolated to @xmath134 . for further details on the boundary conditions and for the analytic solution of equations ( [ eq : vdeq ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : mxeq ] ) see appendix d. the results are plotted in figure [ fig : dp ] .",
    "it is immediately apparent in figure [ fig : dp ] that the actual @xmath1 profile in the solar nssl inferred from helioseismology is steeper than suggested by either of the simple paradigms considered here .",
    "not surprisingly , viscous diffusion tends to suppress shear so the equilibrium @xmath1 profile in this case is nearly independent of radius .",
    "however , the latitudinal differential rotation is still prominent , roughly the same as at @xmath134 as a consequence of the thinness of the layer ( coupled with the boundary conditions ) .",
    "furthermore , a weak negative radial shear ( @xmath115 ) is established at high latitudes .",
    "this is a geometric effect associated with the inefficiency of viscous transport near the rotation axis ( @xmath266 ) .    the profile corresponding to @xmath30 mixing [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : mxeq ] ) ] is steeper than the diffusive profile , again as expected , since the direction of the flux ( @xmath267 ) has a component that is radially inward .",
    "however , note that , within the context of the nssl , _ the concept of turbulent convection mixing angular momentum is not the same as turbulent convection establishing @xmath268 constant_. the thin - shell geometry and the coupling of the nssl to the rotation profile in the deep cz ( modeled here by means of our boundary conditions ) preclude a complete homogenization of @xmath30 even if the local convective transport were to exhibit that tendency .    at high latitudes , the @xmath1 profile implied by @xmath30 mixing is steeper and is more comparable to the helioseismic inversions .",
    "both are less steep than the profile that would arise from a complete homogenization of @xmath30 . however , the helioseismic profile does approach homogenization in radius within about 7 mm of the photosphere .",
    "in other words , the upper bound on the magnitude of @xmath269 near the photosphere appears to be set by the rayleigh stability criterion @xcite @xmath270    note that equation ( [ eq : ray ] ) is only strictly valid under the assumption that the stratification in the convection zone is approximately adiabatic ( @xmath271 ) .",
    "this is of course an oversimplication since the stratification in the nssl is thought to be substantially superadiabatic .",
    "a more rigorous analysis indicates that the rayleigh criterion ( [ eq : ray ] ) is part of a more general formulation of the schwarzchild criterion for convective stability , which is clearly violated in a convection zone , essentially by definition .",
    "an independent stability criterion requires @xmath272 .",
    "however , if @xmath118 isosurfaces are predominantly horizontal , then this provides no constraints on the radial shear in the nssl ] , @xmath115 .",
    "both criteria arise from the solberg - hiland stability analysis as discussed , for example by @xcite . by considering the implications of equation ( [ eq : ray ] ) here",
    ", we are essentially separating out inertial effects from thermal effects , which may operate on different time scales .",
    "the potential relevance of this separation to the nssl is supported by the remarkable correspondence between the maximum radial gradient of the helioseismic @xmath1 profile and the slope implied by equation ( [ eq : ray ] ) , as illustrated in figure [ fig : dp ] .",
    "thus , with these caveats , equation ( [ eq : ray ] ) implies that the radial @xmath1 gradient near the photosphere is what it is because anything steeper would be unstable .",
    "although this is indeed a compelling argument , it is well known that in the presence of a weak magnetic field the rayleigh stability criterion is replaced by the stability criterion associated with the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) .",
    "thus , equation ( [ eq : ray ] ) is replace by the condition that @xmath273 @xcite .",
    "this condition is clearly violated in the nssl .",
    "why might the rotation profile be limited by the hydrodynamic rayleigh criterion ( [ eq : ray ] ) yet violate the mri stability criterion ? there are two potential answers to this question .",
    "the first is that the mri stability analysis may not be applicable in the nssl . according to @xcite ,",
    "the assumptions that underlie the mri criteria are valid for field strengths in the range @xmath274 , where @xmath192 is the transport coefficient ( in units of @xmath182 s@xmath180 ) corresponding to the dominant diffusive process .",
    "dissipation in the nssl is likely dominated by radiation and ohmic diffusion .",
    "the detailed physics is complicated and very sensitive to depth but nevertheless , rough estimates for the corresponding diffusion coefficients give @xmath27510@xmath276@xmath277 @xmath182 s@xmath180 and @xmath278@xmath279 @xmath182 s@xmath180 .",
    "the @xmath280 value is derived from solar structure model s @xcite and the @xmath281 value follows from the spitzer expression for a fully ionized hydrogen plasma @xmath282 @xcite . using @xmath283 g cm@xmath180 , we estimate that the mri analysis of @xcite is valid for field strengths ranging from less than 1 g to more than 10@xmath276 g .",
    "the typical field strength in the nssl is likely to lie within these bounds .",
    "the second possibility is that the hydrodynamic rayleigh instability is somehow more robust or more efficient than the mri .",
    "thus , the nssl may indeed be unstable to mri but the time scale of the instability ( of order the rotation period @xmath285 28 days ) is longer than the time scale over which the shear is established by turbulent stresses ( of order the convective turnover time @xmath285 5 min  1 day ) .",
    "although this is plausible , the same argument would also in principle apply to the rayliegh criterion so it is unclear why equation ( [ eq : ray ] ) must be satisfied while the mri criterion is not .",
    "the depth over which the marginal slope is achieved , roughly within @xmath285 7 mm of the photosphere , suggests that granulation may play a role . in any case , this is an interesting issue that should be explored further with the help of mhd convection simulations .",
    "the analysis presented in  [ sec : homo ] assumes that the net torque @xmath7 is zero , which is clearly not the case ; as demonstrated in ",
    "[ sec : helio ] , observations imply that @xmath7 is negative . thus , we must take this into account if we are to properly assess whether our two simple paradigms for angular momentum transport can adequately account for the observed rotation and meridional flow profiles .",
    "stated another way , observations imply that the meridional flow is supplying angular momentum to the nssl , tending to speed up the local rotation rate , while the turbulent transport must be removing angular momentum in order to maintain a stationary state . in order to assess whether turbulent diffusion or @xmath30 mixing can provide the requisite transport , we must compute @xmath7 from equations ( [ eq : fvd ] ) and ( [ eq : fmx ] ) based on the rotation profile inferred from helioseismology @xmath286 and ask whether it matches the inferred net axial torque shown in figure [ fig : fg]@xmath113 .    of course",
    ", we can not compute @xmath7 explicitly because we do not know _ a priori _ the transport coefficients @xmath241 and @xmath287 .",
    "however , if we assume as in ",
    "[ sec : homo ] that @xmath246 and @xmath257 are constant , then the corresponding torques , @xmath288 and @xmath289 will be proportional to the appropriate differential operators applied to the solar rotation profile , namely @xmath290 the right - hand - side of each of these equations is plotted in figure [ fig : lap ] .    the immediate impression from figure [ fig : lap ]",
    "is that the two results look nearly identical .",
    "this is a consequence of the steepness of the radial @xmath1 gradient and the thin - shell geometry .",
    "thus , the dominant contribution to both operators is the second radial derivative : @xmath291 as shown in figure [ fig : dp ] , the solar @xmath1 profile is nearly flat at the base of the nssl ( @xmath292 ) and steepens with increasing radius , reaching its maximum slope near the photosphere .",
    "thus , @xmath293 and the quantities shown in figure [ fig : lap ] are predominantly negative in the nssl ( @xmath294 ) .",
    "the negative sign of the quantities plotted in figure [ fig : lap ] bodes well for the viability of our two simple paradigms for angular momentum transport .",
    "both viscous diffusion and @xmath30 mixing would tend to flatten out the negative curvature of the solar @xmath1 profile ( @xmath295 ) .",
    "this would tend to decelerate the local rotation rate ( @xmath33 ) and may thus serve to remove the angular momentum supplied to the nssl by the meridional flow .",
    "the efficiency of the transport scales with the coefficients @xmath241 and @xmath287 and could be calibrated to give the proper net torque , at least in an integrated sense .    however , the profiles shown in figure [ fig : lap ] are clearly different than the net axial torque profile inferred from helioseismic measurements , shown in figure [ fig : fg]@xmath113 .",
    "in particular , the idealized profiles in figure [ fig : lap ] peak at the equator while the helioseismic profile in figure [ fig : fg]@xmath113 peaks at mid latitudes , with a weak positive signal at the equator .",
    "thus , our simple paradigms appear to be inconsistent with helioseismic inversions .",
    "however , it may plausibly be argued that the assumption of homogeneous , isotropic coeffients @xmath246 and @xmath257 is unrealistic and unnecessary . in the next section we consider whether this can redeem our simple paradigms .    before proceeding ,",
    "we note in passing that the @xmath30 mixing operator shown in figure [ fig : lap]@xmath58 suggests a reversal in the sign of the torque @xmath7 at high latitudes . since the local helioseismic inversions only extend up to latitudes of about 50@xmath157 , we can not determine whether a similar sign change occurs in the sun .",
    "however , some measurements of the meridional flow suggest that there may be persistent high - latitude counter - cells , which are particularly apparent at solar minimum when magnetic effects can be more easily separated out ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* see also fig .",
    "[ fig : vth_helio ] ) . under the justified assumption that the angular momentum continues to decrease toward the poles ( @xmath296 in the northern hemisphere ) ,",
    "equation ( [ eq : gp ] ) implies that a high - latitude counter - cell would indeed correspond to a change in sign of the net axial torque @xmath7 ( such that @xmath34 ) .",
    "the idealized rotation profiles and net axial torques considered in  [ sec : homo ] and  [ sec : mflow ] are only valid for constant density - weighted transport coefficients @xmath246 and @xmath257 .",
    "if one allows for inhomogeneous , anisotropic diffusion tensors then can the two paradigms considered here provide a better fit to helioseismic inversions ?",
    "this is to some extent a tautology ; one might expect that one can construct a diffusion tensor to reproduce any arbitrary @xmath1 and @xmath7 profiles so the results of this analysis would not be very enlightening .",
    "however , we will demonstrate that turbulent diffusion can be ruled out as a viable paradigm even if it is anisotropic and inhomogeneous .",
    "mixing angular momentum , on the other hand , may be more promising .",
    "note that , with regard to anisotropy , we are referring explicitly to the off - diagonal components of the viscous stress tensor @xmath241 or its @xmath30-mixing analogue , @xmath287 .",
    "this should not be confused with the off - diagonal components of the reynolds stress tensor , which are nonzero even for constant scalar values of @xmath241 and @xmath287 . indeed , the off - diagonal components of the reynolds stress tensor are essential in order to account for the maintenance of mean flows .",
    "perhaps the most conspicuous fault with the profiles derived in ",
    "[ sec : homo ] is that they admit an angular momentum flux through the solar surface . in the sun ,",
    "the sharp drop in density near the surface precludes any significant angular momentum flux through the photosphere on a time scale comparable to the convection turnover time or the rotation period .",
    "angular momentum is lost through the solar wind but this loss rate is many orders of magnitude smaller than the rate at which angular momentum is continually circulated through the nssl by convection and meridional flows .",
    "thus , we consider equation ( [ eq : fvd ] ) again but we now allow for a diffusion coefficient that depends on radius . furthermore , we allow for anisotropic transport so we can regard @xmath241 as a tensor . for the time being we will neglect the off - diagonal elements of the tensor so we can express @xmath241 in terms of vertical and horizontal component @xmath297 and @xmath298 .    for @xmath299",
    "= constant we found in  [ sec : homo ] that the resulting @xmath1 profile was too shallow to account for the helioseismic @xmath1 profile .",
    "can diffusion give rise to a steeper profile ?",
    "the answer is yes , but only if the vertical diffusion @xmath299 increases with radius ( @xmath300 ) .",
    "this would provide an outward angular momentum flux that becomes larger closer to the solar surface , providing the requisite flux divergence to decelerate the nssl .",
    "however , as pointed out in the previous paragraph , this can not be sustained all the way to the photosphere where @xmath226 and thus @xmath301 must drop to zero .    to demonstrate that even an anisotropic , inhomogeneous diffusion can not account for the nssl consider a closed volume @xmath27 bounded from below by the surface @xmath302 and from above by the photosphere @xmath4 .",
    "latitudinal boundaries are at the equator and at an arbitrary colatitude @xmath303 , located in the northern hemisphere close enough to the equator to be accessible to helioseismic inversions , say @xmath304 ( corresponding to a latitude between 0 and 60@xmath157 ) .",
    "we now integrate the net axial torque @xmath7 over the volume , allowing for anisotropic transport and assuming @xmath305 at @xmath306 .",
    "the symmetry of the @xmath1 profile implies no angular momentum flux through the equatorial plane ( @xmath307 ) so the integrated torque is given by @xmath308 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath223 is the bounding surface , and the first and second terms on the right - hand - side are to be evaluated at @xmath309 and @xmath310 respectively .    as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : helio ] and  [ sec : mflow ] , the integral in equation ( [ eq : intor ] ) must be negative . however , if we choose @xmath311 to lie within the nssl , then @xmath260 and the first term is positive .",
    "in other words , angular momentum flux into the nssl through the lower surface @xmath302 must be shunted poleward in order to be consistent with a negative ( or zero ) net torque @xmath312 .",
    "although the latitudinal flux is indeed poleward ( @xmath313 at @xmath314 ) , it can not be efficient enough to maintain a negative @xmath269 throughout the nssl . as @xmath311 approaches @xmath4 from below",
    ", the second term in brackets can be approximated by @xmath315 . in order to transport the requisite flux ,",
    "the viscosity anisotropy @xmath316 would have to increase radially without bound , becoming infinite at the photosphere .",
    "this argument can be readily generalized to rule out any arbitrary outward flux @xmath317 . the implication ,",
    "then , is that _ the angular momentum flux in the nssl must be radially inward_. one can in principle salvage the diffusive paradigm if one invokes negative diffusion or the off - diagonal elements of the turbulent viscosity tensor , namely an inward angular momentum flux that is proportional to the latitudinal shear .",
    "however , such prescriptions seem rather contrived .",
    "thus , we can confidently say that the turbulent transport in the nssl can not be adequately modeled as a turbulent diffusion .",
    "how does our other paradigm fare , namely that of mixing angular momentum ?",
    "we can see immediately that this paradigm is more plausible because the angular momentum transport is indeed inward @xmath318 . a steeper @xmath115 profile",
    "could then be achieved by means of a diffusion coefficient @xmath257 that decreases with radius ( @xmath257 ) , approaching zero at the photosphere , as required by the condition @xmath305 at @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the @xmath30-mixing paradigm is consistent with both an inward @xmath1 gradient ( @xmath73 ) and no net angular momentum flux through the photosphere .",
    "however , in order to be consistent with the form of the net axial torque inferred from helioseismology , the density - weighted mixing coefficient @xmath319 would have to have a very particular form .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : fg]@xmath113 , the net axial torque is nearly zero at the equator whereas @xmath320 has a prominent peak at the equator ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lap]@xmath58 ) . in order to see how this may be remedied ,",
    "assume that @xmath321 is isotropic but varies with radius with a scale height much less than the solar radius @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , assume as in equation ( [ eq : cylindrical ] ) that the @xmath30 profile is nearly cylindrical",
    ". then equation ( [ eq : fmx ] ) yields @xmath322 if @xmath319 decreases with increasing radius as suggested in the previous paragraph , then inserting the helioseismic value for @xmath323 implies that the first two terms are negative at the equator . in other words ,",
    "the sharp decrease of @xmath321 exacerbates the prominent negative net torque @xmath7 seen in figure [ fig : lap]@xmath58 .",
    "one way out of this dilemma is if the slope flattens out near the photosphere so @xmath324 .",
    "then the last term in equation ( [ eq : inhomo ] ) is positive and correspondence with figure [ fig : fg]@xmath113 becomes possible .    in summary ,",
    "helioseismology sets fairly strict constraints on the nature of the turbulent angular momentum flux @xmath226 in the nssl , including : ( 1 ) @xmath226 must be radially inward ( @xmath318 ) , ( 2 ) there must be no flux through the photosphere ( @xmath325 at @xmath41 ) , ( 3 ) @xmath226 must diverge at mid - latitudes ( @xmath33 ) in order to balance the advection of angular momentum by the meridional flow , and ( 4 ) turbulent transport at low latitudes must redistribute angular momentum in such a way as to support a steep radial @xmath1 gradient while minimizing the net axial torque ( @xmath326 ) .",
    "the turbulent diffusion paradigm , equation ( [ eq : fvd ] ) , does not meet these constraints and is therefore not a valid model of turbulent transport in the nssl .",
    "the alternative ansatz of @xmath30 mixing , as expressed in equation ( [ eq : fmx ] ) , is at least feasible , but it would require a fine - tuned , inhomogeneous and/or anisotropic mixing coefficient @xmath319 .",
    "for example , it could in principle be achieved with a vertical mixing coefficient that decreases with radius but flattens out near the photosphere ( @xmath327 , @xmath328 ) .",
    "a power law dependence @xmath329 with @xmath330 may satisfiy such a requirement .",
    "however , it is more likely that the turbulent reynolds stress in the nssl is more complex than either of these crude , local models .      despite the conclusion of section  [ sec : anisotropy ] regarding the non - diffusive nature of @xmath7 , it is reasonable to expect that @xmath8 may operate essentially as a turbulent diffusion . in order to appreciate why this may be the case ,",
    "consider again the time - dependent thought experiment discussed in ",
    "[ sec : thex ] .",
    "here we begin with a spherical volume @xmath27 in uniform rotation and a retrograde torque @xmath7 is introduced in the surface layers ( @xmath331 ) .",
    "this will establish a poleward flow @xmath158 which will steadily increase in amplitude , striving to establish a cylindrical rotation profile as discussed in  [ sec : thex ] .",
    "given the thin - shell geometry of the nssl , one may expect strong vertical gradients @xmath332 to be established .",
    "furthermore , given the small scale of photospheric convection relative to the mean flow , one may expect turbulent stresses to resist such shearing motions .",
    "this would imply that the resulting axial differential rotation profile @xmath84 is determined by how efficiently small - scale convective motions can mix latitudinal momentum , @xmath158 , or equivalently , suppress zonal vorticity , @xmath105 .",
    "thus , under this scenario we may expect that @xmath8 will be diffusive ( down - gradient ) in nature , and furthermore , that the strain rate tensor will be dominated by vertical gradients in the poleward flow .",
    "the turbulent transport would then be given by @xmath333 where @xmath241 is again the turbulent ( kinematic ) viscosity .",
    "note that this expression assumes that the scale of variation of the dynamic viscosity @xmath334 is larger than that of the shear @xmath335 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : tdiff ] ) can in principle provide the momentum transport required to balance the coriolis force associated with the axial shear @xmath66 . however , this is contingent on the amplitude of @xmath336 being strongly peaked near the photosphere , such that @xmath337 .",
    "this does not appear to be supported by local helioseismic inversions (  [ sec : helio ] ) , but the sensitivity and resolution of the inversions is likely not adequate enough to provide reliable estimates for third - order derivatives of @xmath336 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an alternative is that the dynamic turbulent viscosity @xmath246 decrease with radius while the velocity amplitude increase , consistent with no tangential stress at the photosphere .    in summary",
    ", we can say that if the turbulent transport @xmath8 does indeed dominate over baroclinic forcing @xmath114 as suggested in ",
    "[ sec : what ] then it must resist the poleward meridional flow induced by @xmath7 through the coriolis force .",
    "thus , @xmath8 must be negative in the northern hemisphere and positive in the southern hemisphere . a turbulent diffusion or similar mixing process may be adequate , as would a more general formulation .",
    "we have demonstrated that the turbulent angular momentum transport in the solar near - surface shear layer ( nssl ) is responsible for the persistent poleward meridional flow but it does not uniquely determine the mid - latitude @xmath1 profile . rather , the axial rotation gradient @xmath66 must be maintained by turbulent stresses in the meridional plane .",
    "more specifically , a retrograde zonal force ( axial torque ) @xmath33 establishes the nssl and regulates the poleward meridional flow while meridional forcing regulates the mid - latitude @xmath1 profile .",
    "furthermore , we argue that a transition in the meridional force balance from baroclinic to turbulent stresses [ @xmath114 to @xmath8 in equation ( [ eq : mer ] ) ] may determine the base of the nssl .    more generally , we have demonstrated that there is close dynamical relationship between the differential rotation and the meridional circulation and that the structure of the nssl as inferred from helioseismology relies on a delicate nonlinear , nonlocal interplay between the two . the same physical mechanism ( @xmath33 ) that establishes negative radial shear @xmath73 also establishes poleward flow ( @xmath74 in the northern hemisphere ) . as suggested by previous authors",
    ", we attribute this physical mechanism to reynolds and possibly maxwell stresses associated with the relatively small - scale convection ( granulation to supergranulation ) that permeates the nssl .    throughout our analysis",
    ", we have considered the inertia of the mean flow explicitly , incorporating other physical processes in the generalized zonal and meridional forcing terms @xmath7 and @xmath8 which we refer to as turbulent stresses .",
    "this is intended to clarify the essential physics of how the differential rotation and meridional circulation are coupled in their response to zonal and meridional forcing , independent of the detailed nature of this forcing , which is unknown .",
    "the reader may wish to regard @xmath7 and @xmath8 simply as the the convective reynolds stress , since this is likely to be their dominant component ( appendix a ) .",
    "however , as noted in the introduction , other forcing such as large - scale lorentz forces and viscous diffusion can induce mean flows in an analogous way .",
    "we have demonstrated that turbulent transport in the nssl is non - diffusive in nature and must be directed radially inward (  [ sec : transport ] ) .",
    "inspired by numerical simulations of turbulent convection at large rossby numbers , we have considered an alternative paradigm for turbulent transport based on the mixing of specific angular momentum , @xmath30 .",
    "we have shown that the conservation of angular momentum alone can not account for the existence of the nssl (  [ sec : meridional ] ) but the form of the rotation profile may be consistent with @xmath30 mixing if the mixing coefficient is inhomogeneous and/or anisotropic (  [ sec : transport ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that @xmath30 mixing is a more general concept than simply @xmath30-homogenization ( constant @xmath30 ) when one takes into account the coupling between the nssl and the deep convection zone . yet",
    ", the failure of simple turbulent diffusion or @xmath30-mixing prescriptions demonstrates that the nssl is not simply a passive response to deeper forcing ; it must be actively maintained by anisotropic and inhomogeneous turbulent transport .",
    "estimates based on local and global helioseismology indicate that it takes 24% of the solar luminosity to maintain the nssl against the inertia of the mean flow (  [ sec : anen ] ) .",
    "most of this work is associated with transporting angular momentum out of the layer ( @xmath212 in table 1 ) in order to balance the convergence of angular momentum flux into the layer by meridional flow advection .",
    "the estimated amplitudes of turbulent transport in the latitude and longitude directions ( @xmath197 and @xmath198 ) are remarkably similar , given the very different way in which these two quantities were obtained ( the former follows from `` uncurling '' global @xmath1 inversions while the latter involves estimates of zonal and meridional flows from local helioseismology ; see  [ sec : anen ] ) .",
    "the vertical transport in the middle of the nssl is about an order of magnitude less ( at the base of the nssl , @xmath134 , @xmath197 is zero by assumption and our local helioseismic inversions provide no information on @xmath198 ) .",
    "the sense of all these terms is such that turbulent transport is decelerating the rotation rate in the nssl and opposing the meridional flow .",
    "estimates of the spin - down time scale indicate that it is similar to the ventilation time scale of about 600 days (  [ sec : anen ] ) .",
    "this is long compared to the turnover time scale of convective motions , @xmath338 1 day , implying that the net turbulent angular momentum transport is rather inefficient .",
    "finally , we note that the upper limit to the slope of the radial @xmath1 gradient appears to be set by the rayleigh criterion , equation ( [ eq : ray ] ) .",
    "however , it is unclear why this intrinsically hydrodynamic condition should be satisfied in the nssl while its mhd analogue , the stability criterion for the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) @xmath273 , is clearly violated .",
    "several authors have sought to investigate the dynamics of the nssl through numerical simulations of solar convection in thin spherical shells or spherical segments , placing the lower boundary of the simulation domain within the upper convection zone , typically above 0.9@xmath4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "relative to global simulations spanning the entire convection zone , these have the great advantage that smaller scales can be resolved so the turbulent transport can be more reliably captured .",
    "although these simulations have provided insight into the dynamics of the nssl , none have accurately reproduced the angular velocity profile throughout the nssl . as we have demonstrated here , the dynamics of the nssl involves a delicate balance between small - scale turbulent transport , large - scale mean flows , and coupling to the deep convection zone ( cz ) .",
    "even if thin - shell models properly capture the turbulent transport , they must also capture or otherwise mimic the coupling to the cz if they are to achieve solar - like mean flows .",
    "a straightforward and common strategy in thin - shell models is to impose a solar - like latitudinal differential rotation on the lower boundary ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the lower boundary is also impermeable , as is often the case , then it is clear that the system can not sustain a poleward flow throughout the layer .",
    "what implications might this have for the differential rotation ? as is demonstrated in @xmath339 , the meridional circulation supplies angular momentum to the nssl while turbulent stresses must remove this angular momentum .",
    "this balance , together with the meridional stresses @xmath8 ( or @xmath114 ) determine the mean flow profiles . if the poleward flow is artificially suppressed by an impenetrable boundary condition , then there must be alternative source of angular momentum to balance turbulent transport . without this source ,",
    "the @xmath1 profile will be adversely affected in addition to the meridional flow profile .",
    "the rotational coupling between the convection zone and the nssl in this class of numerical models is achieved by means of viscous diffusion .",
    "this is artificial in the sense that the viscosity used is many orders of magnitude larger than that of the solar plasma .",
    "however , can this effectively mimic the coupling that is expected to occur in the sun ? on the positive side , viscous coupling can indeed serve as an angular momentum source , allowing the integrated turbulent stresses @xmath312 throughout the nssl to be negative , as in the sun .",
    "however , the latitudinal distribution of the viscous torques is likely to be very different than for gyroscopic pumping .",
    "if @xmath73 at nearly all latitudes in the solar nssl as implied by helioseismic inversions ( although these are uncertain poleward of 70@xmath157 ) , then viscous coupling would imply outward angular momentum transport everywhere .",
    "by contrast , the meridional flow would impart angular momentum at low latitudes and remove it at high latitudes in such a way that the net convergence into the layer is positive .",
    "this implies a high - latitude angular momentum flux that may be up the gradient of @xmath1 .",
    "one would expect the resulting @xmath1 profile to be very different than for viscous coupling .",
    "mean flow profiles would be similarly sensitive to impermable boundary conditions in latitude .    thus , in order to properly model the nssl , numerical models must either be deep enough to capture the closed meridional circulation , including the poleward flow at the surface and the return equatorward flow , or they must impose boundary conditions that are conducive to establishing solar - like mean flows .",
    "these may include open boundaries on which the rotation profile @xmath1 is specified in addition to an imposed net axial torque @xmath7 , chosen to induce a commensurate meridional flow through the boundary by means of gyroscopic pumping , as expressed by equation ( [ eq : gp ] ) .",
    "even if the simulation domain is in principle large enough to capture the complete , closed meridional circulation , the delicate balance expressed in equation ( [ eq : gp ] ) implies that the meridional flow is particularly sensitive to artificial viscous dissipation .",
    "if viscous angular momentum transport largely balances the angular momentum transport by the convective reynolds stress as in many numerical models , then @xmath7 will nearly vanish and the meridional flow may be very different than what occurs in the sun @xcite . regardless of the boundary conditions ,",
    "realistic meridional flow profiles require minimal viscous dissipation .",
    "we are very grateful to rachel howe for providing the global rotational inversions shown in figure [ fig : dr ] and analysed in  [ sec : helio ] and mark rast for providing data and insight with regard to photospheric irradiance variations .",
    "we thank michael thompson and an anonymous referee for comments on the manuscript and kyle auguston , michael mcintyre , matthias rempel and juri toomre for many helpful discussions . in particular , we thank michael mcintyre for inspiring and educating us on the joys of gyroscopic pumping over the years and for suggesting the term `` force curl '' for @xmath8 .",

    "in this appendix we explicitly identify what is included in the turbulent stress terms @xmath7 and @xmath8 that are introduced in sections [ sec : concepts ] and [ sec : zonvort ] and that are used throughout the paper .",

    "this lets us more gracefully incorporate the differential and uniform rotation components into a single , non - uniform rotation profile , @xmath1 .",
    "however , for the benefit of readers , in this appendix we wish to illustrate explicitly where the coriolis force enters into this analysis .",
    "thus , we can convert equation ( [ appa : mom ] ) into a rotating coordinate system ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath347 ) by writing @xmath348 and @xmath349 . substituting these changes into ( [ appa : mom ] ) yields @xmath350 where @xmath351 , @xmath352 .",

    "the stress tensor @xmath357 is the same as @xmath343 with @xmath20 replaced by @xmath358 ( and @xmath11 by @xmath353 ) .    multiplying the zonal component of ( [ appa : rot ] ) by @xmath12 and averaging over longitude ( @xmath353 ) yields @xmath359\\ ] ] where @xmath360 .",
    "the right - hand - side is defined as the net axial torque @xmath7 .",
    "thus , it includes the reynolds stress ( first term ) , the lorentz force ( second term ) , and the viscous diffusion ( third term ) .",
    "the lorentz force may be decomposed into a contirbution from mean fields @xmath361 and a maxwell stress , @xmath362 .",
    "meanwhile , the left - hand - side of ( [ appa : amom ] ) includes the coriolis force and the nonlinear advection ( inertia ) associated with the mean flows , @xmath363 .",
    "we emphasize that equation ( [ appa : amom ] ) follows directly from equation ( [ appa : rot ] ) with no additional assumptions [ although we have used the mass continuity equation @xmath364 in the derivation ] .",
    "equation ( [ appa : rot ] ) in turn follows directly from ( [ appa : mom ] ) .",
    "the only assumption in any of this derivation is the mhd approximation that underlies equation ( [ appa : mom ] ) . if we make the justified assumption that @xmath365 ( as , for example , in the anelastic approximation ) , then the first term on the left - hand side of ( [ appa : amom ] ) is just @xmath366 .",

    "the second term on the left - hand - side , involving @xmath373 includes the coriolis force and the inertia associated with the differential rotation , @xmath374 .",
    "the term on the right - hand - side involving the mean meridional circulation , @xmath375 is estimated to be about two orders of magnitude smaller than this .",
    "since we wish to focus on the primary components that contribute to the force balance and the inertia of the mean flow , we include the meridional circulation term with the turbulent stress term @xmath8 .",
    "alternatively , since the kinetic energy density of the convection is at least two orders of magnitude larger than that in the meridional circulation , it is justified to neglect the meridional flow term in @xmath8 altogether , relative to the reynolds stress .",
    "the first term on the right - hand - side of equation ( [ appa : mer ] ) is the baroclinic term associated with the mean stratification , @xmath376 and @xmath377 , which we define as @xmath114 in equation ( [ eq : bc ] ) .",

    "in fact , if we again make the approximation that @xmath160 to lowest order , then this residual baroclinic term is just proportional to @xmath380 .",
    "other contributions to @xmath8 include the nonlinear advection of the mean meridional flow ( the term involving @xmath375 , which is likely negligible as noted above ) , the reynolds stress ( the term involving @xmath381 ) , the lorentz force ( the term involving @xmath342 ) , and the viscous diffusion ( the term involving @xmath343 ) .",
    "we use the term _ turbulent stresses _ loosely , since it is clear that @xmath7 and @xmath8 may in principle include contributions from the large - scale lorentz force and the viscous diffusion , which need not be turbulent . however , these are not likely to be important in the solar nssl .",
    "the small molecular viscosity of the solar plasma makes viscous diffusion negligible and the persistence of the nssl throughout the solar cycle suggests that it is not maintained by the large - scale lorentz force .",
    "thus , we expect that the dominant components of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are indeed the turbulent reynolds and maxwell stresses associated with small - scale convection .",
    "because it is essentially non - local and thus sensitive to the global geometry , boundary conditions , and inhomogeneities , gyroscopic pumping is a subtle phenomenon that generally requires numerical calculations to find equilibrium states .",

    "here we present such an analytic solution in the context of the solar nssl . for others , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we emphasize again the point made in  [ sec : concepts ] ; that the gyroscopic pumping equation ( [ eq : gp ] ) can induce a meridional flow with relatively little impact on the rotational shear . here",
    "we illustrate this by independently specifying both a differential rotation profile @xmath112 and a zonal force @xmath7 and then proceeding to derive a solution for the meridional flow that links the two .",

    "note that the term in equation ( [ vzsoln1 ] ) involving @xmath401 vanishes at @xmath42 but as we ll see below , the term involving their derivatives does not .",
    "this is consistent with the impenetrable boundary condition @xmath402 at @xmath41 since the nonzero @xmath336 has both @xmath403 and @xmath404 components .    the derivatives in equation ( [ vzsoln1 ] )",

    "since @xmath408 for @xmath409 , then continuity of @xmath403 requires that it should vanish at @xmath134 as well , along with the forcing @xmath7 . using ( [ aforce ] ) , this can be achieved if @xmath410 .    as a consequence of the way we set up the problem",
    ", we also have @xmath411 so , in order for the circulation to be continuous , we require these expressions to hold at @xmath134 as well . it is straightforward to show from equation ( [ avlam ] ) that equation ( [ divbc ] ) is satisfied at @xmath134 if @xmath412 . combining this with the previous expression then yields @xmath413 and @xmath414",

    "the analytic solution is plotted in figure [ gyro_mc ] .",

    "turbulent stresses are weak @xmath436 and the rotation is nearly uniform so the circulation contours would follow cylindrical surfaces as in region 2 of the present example . in any case , the solution discussed in this section is only intended to give a rough feel for how gyroscopic pumping in the nssl might impact the dynamics in the upper convection zone .    still , equations ( [ aomega ] ) , ( [ psiappx ] ) , ( [ iz ] ) , and ( [ psi3 ] ) .",
