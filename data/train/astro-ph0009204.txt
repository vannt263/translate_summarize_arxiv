    "the hypothesis that the universe underwent a period of exponential expansion at very early times is the most popular theory of the early universe .",
    "the  old \" @xcite and  new \" @xcite inflationary universe models were able to solve the  horizon \" ,  flatness \" and  structure formation \" problems creating , in turn , their own problems , some of which the  chaotic \" model @xcite and its extensions @xcite could tackle . on the other hand , these kind of cosmological models are favored by recent measurements from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite and the wmap results @xcite . usually , inflationary models are all based on the use of new fundamental scalar fields , the  inflatons \" , which can not be the higgs fields of ordinary gauge theories .",
    "later , other possible alternatives to inflationary cosmology were proposed . rather than changing the matter content of the universe ,",
    "new concepts were adopted such as non - commutative space - time quantizations @xcite , brane settings of a cycling universe @xcite , and a change in the speed of light in the early universe @xcite or , more generally , a varying fine structure constant @xmath1 @xcite . in @xcite , we have generalized bekenstein model @xcite for the time variation of @xmath1 to qcd strong coupling constant @xmath2 and found that experimental constraints going backward till quasar formation times rule out @xmath2 variability . in this letter , we discuss how our  minimal \" bekenstein - like model for @xmath2 , when implemented in the very early universe , can provide a realization of inflation driven by the trace anomaly of qcd energy momentum tensor .",
    "inflationary models driven by the trace anomaly of conformally coupled matter fields are treated in the literature @xcite while in our toy model we concentrate on the gauge fields of qcd . assuming the universe is radiation - dominated at early times and that vacuum expectation values predominate over matter densities , we find , with suitable values of the gluon condensate @xmath0 far larger than its present value and the bekenstein length scale @xmath3 smaller than the planck - wheeler length scale @xmath4 , that our model for inflation is self - consistent with acceptable numerical results to solve the fluctuation and other problems .",
    "we find that the qcd lagrangian with a changing strong coupling constant leads naturally to a monomial quadratic potential like the chaotic scenario .",
    "however , while the large values of the inflaton matter field plague the latter scenario , they just amount in our model to a reduction of the strong charge by around @xmath5 times during the inflation .",
    "we shall not dwell on the possible mechanisms by which the gluon condensate could have decreased to reach its present value , and which might be necessary in order not to have exotic relics .",
    "rather we wish to concentrate on the conditions we should impose on our model to be interesting .",
    "we hope this phenomenological approach could prompt further work on a possible connection between time - varying fundamental  constants\"and inflationary models .",
    "we follow the notations of @xcite .",
    "therein , we used the qcd lagrangian with a varying coupling  constant \" @xmath6 where the metric used for raising and lowering indices is the r - w metric , @xmath3 is the bekenstein scale length , @xmath7 is a scalar gauge - invariant and dimensionless field representing the variation of the strong coupling",
    " constant \" @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the covariant derivative and where the gluon tensor field is given by : @xmath10\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we assume homogeneity and isotropy for an expanding universe and so consider only temporal variations for @xmath11 .",
    "we assume also , rather plausibly in the radiation - dominated early universe , negligence of matter contribution to get the following equations of motion @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the expansion scale factor in the r - w metric .",
    "computing the canonical energy - momentum tensor @xmath15 we get a non gauge invariant quantity .",
    "this may be cured by a standard technique @xcite amounting to a subtraction of a total derivative and hence not changing the equations of motion .",
    "we subtract the total derivative @xmath16 to get , with the use of equation ( [ equation1 ] ) , the gauge - invariant energy momentum tensor @xmath17\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since we assume radiation dominated era during the very early universe we can concentrate on the gauge fields and neglect the matter fields contribution and so we decompose our energy momentum tensor into two parts : the gauge part and the @xmath18-scalar field part @xmath19 \\right ) + \\left ( - \\frac{1}{l^2}\\frac{\\partial_{\\alpha}\\epsilon \\partial_{\\beta}\\epsilon}{\\epsilon^2}-g_{\\alpha\\beta } \\left [ -\\frac{1}{2l^2}\\frac{\\epsilon_{,\\mu}\\epsilon^{,\\mu}}{\\epsilon^2 } \\right ] \\right)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here all the operators are supposed to be renormalized and it is essential in the inflationary paradigm that quantum effects are small in order to get small fluctuations in the cmb , which will be seen to be the case in the model .    the contribution of the scalar field to the energy density @xmath20 and to the pressure @xmath21 can be computed and we get @xmath22    on the other hand , the gauge field contribution @xmath23 can be decomposed into trace and traceless parts . in such a way , we can write the corresponding energy mass density @xmath24 and the pressure @xmath25 , like in  ordinary \" qcd , as a sum of two terms :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the density corresponding to the  traceless \" part of the gauge field satisfying @xmath28 while the trace part of the gauge field energy - momentum tensor is proportional to @xmath29 and behaves like a ` cosmological constant ' term .",
    "thus , the corresponding equation of state reads : @xmath30 we shall assume , here , that the trace anomaly relation for @xmath31 is the same as the `` ordinary '' qcd trace anomaly . this can be justified because the energy - momentum tensor @xmath32 is identical in form to  ordinary \" qcd and that the trace anomaly which involves only gauge invariant quantities should , by dimensional analysis , be proportional to @xmath33 .",
    "however , we have checked that a change in the numerical value of the proportionality factor would not alter our conclusions .",
    "thus we take , up to leading order in the time - varying coupling  constant \" @xmath34 , the relation @xcite : @xmath35 again , neglecting matter contribution during the radiation dominated era , we limit our gluon operator @xmath36 matrix elements to its condensate vacuum expectation value @xmath0 , and so we get : @xmath37 hence , we can write the total energy mass density as @xmath38 and equation ( [ impose ] ) would suggest , in analogy to ordinary inflationary models , that the qcd trace anomaly could generate the inflation . for this , let us assume that the  trace - anomaly \" energy mass density contribution is much larger than the other densities : @xmath39 then , equation ( [ rhot ] ) tells that the vacuum gluon condensate @xmath0 should have a negative value which is not unreasonable since the inflationary vacuum has  strange \" properties . in ordinary inflationary models",
    ", it is filled with repulsive - gravity matter turning gravity on its head @xcite .",
    "this reversal of the vacuum properties is reflected , in our model , by a reversal of sign for the vacuum gluon condensate .",
    "now we seek a consistent inflationary solution to the frw equations in a flat space - time : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is newton s constant . the first frw equation with ( [ rhot ] ) will give    @xmath42    on the other hand , the equation of motion ( eq.[equation2 ] ) of the scalar field can be expressed in the following way : @xmath43 this equation differs from the ordinary ` matter ' inflationary scenarios in the term @xmath44 .",
    "however , for `` slow roll '' solutions we neglect the terms involving @xmath45 and @xmath46 to get @xmath47 which is the same as the `` slow roll '' equation of motion of the inflaton in ordinary scenarios . in our model , the `` slow roll '' condition can be written as : @xmath48 this gives us the first hint that bekenstein hypothesis ( @xmath49 ) might not survive .",
    "now , we set @xmath50 , the value of @xmath18-field at the end of inflation @xmath51 , to @xmath52 so that the time evolution of the strong coupling terminates with the end of inflation .",
    "we expect for `` slow roll '' solutions that @xmath53 , the value of @xmath18 at the initial time of inflation @xmath54 corresponding to when the cmb modes freezed out , to be of order @xmath52 . taking this into account , and in order that the changes of the hubble constant and the energy mass density are not very large during the inflation , we assume the gluon condensate value @xmath0 to stay approximately constant during much of the inflation . then we get a linear evolution in time for the @xmath18- scalar field @xmath55    one can make explicit the correspondence between our model with @xmath18-scalar field and the chaotic scenario with an @xmath56-inflaton matter field .",
    "looking at equation ( [ rhot ] ) and comparing with @xmath57 in ordinary inflationary models , we see that the gluon condensate plays a role of a potential for the  inflaton\"-@xmath18 field .",
    "comparing equations ( [ h ] ) and ( [ potential ] ) with the corresponding relations in ordinary inflationary models : @xmath58 and remembering that the dimension of the matter scalar field @xmath56 is one , we have @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and we can find the relations between @xmath61 and @xmath62 : @xmath63",
    "now , we check that our model is able to fix the usual problems of the standard ( big bang ) cosmology . first , in order to solve the  horizon \" and  flatness \" problems we need an inflation @xmath64 of order @xmath65 implying an inflation period @xmath66 such that @xmath67 furthermore , it should satisfy the constraint @xmath68 so that not to conflict with the explanation of the baryon number and not to create too large density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the bound @xmath69 corresponds to the time , after the big bang , when the electroweak symmetry breaking took place .",
    "presumably , our inflation should have ended far before this time .",
    "thus , from equations ( [ hubbletime ] ) , ( [ times ] ) and ( [ h ] ) we get the following bounds on @xmath70 : @xmath71 in order to determine @xmath53 , we have @xmath72 which gives , using equations ( [ rhot ] ) and ( [ potential ] ) , the relation : @xmath73 next , comes the  formation of structure \" problem and we require the fractional density fluctuations at the end of inflation to be of the order @xmath74 so that quantum fluctuations in the de sitter phase of the inflationary universe form the source of perturbations providing the seeds for galaxy formation and in order to agree with the cmb anisotropy limits . within the relativistic theory of cosmological perturbations @xcite ,",
    "the above fractional density fluctuations represent ( to linear order ) a gauge - invariant quantity and satisfy the equation @xmath75 where @xmath76 represent the mass perturbations .",
    "the initial fluctuations are generated quantum mechanically and , at the linearized level , the equations describing both gravitational and matter perturbations can be quantized in a consistent way @xcite .",
    "the time dependence of the mass is reflected in the nontrivial form of the solutions to the mode equations and one can compute the expectation value of field operators such as the power spectrum and get the following result for the initial mass perturbation @xcite @xmath77 whence @xmath78 in order to evaluate @xmath79 we use the energy conservation equation : @xmath80 and after substituting @xmath81 we get @xmath82 and we could check that @xmath83 where @xmath84 and so , when the `` slow roll '' condition ( [ conscond1 ] ) is satisfied , our solution assuming the predominance of the  trace - anomaly \" energy mass density is self - consistent . substituting equation ( [ initial ] ) in ( [ fluctfinal2 ] ) and using equation ( [ potential ] )",
    "we get @xmath85 hence , taking @xmath86 we obtain @xmath87 and combining this last result with ( [ bound1 ] ) , we get @xmath88 the `` slow roll '' condition ( [ conscond1 ] ) is consistent with the upper bound , while the lower bound restricts @xmath53 not to be too large .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible to calculate the spectral index of the primordial power spectrum for a quadratic potential as follows : @xmath89 and we find : @xmath90 the inflation would end ( @xmath91 ) when the `` slow roll '' parameter @xmath92 .",
    "we should evaluate the qcd coupling constant @xmath93 at an energy scale corresponding to the inflationary period .",
    "we take this to be around the gut scale @xmath94 and @xmath95 whereas the weak logarithmic dependence would assure the same order of magnitude for @xmath96 calculated at other larger scales . with",
    "@xmath97 @xcite we estimate @xmath98 , and so we get @xmath99 this is in disagreement with bekenstein assumption that @xmath4 is the shortest length scale in any physical theory .",
    "however , it should be noted that beckenstein s framework is very similar to the dilatonic sector of string theory and it has been pointed out in the context of string theories@xcite that there is no need for a universal relation between the planck and the string scale . furthermore , determining the order of magnitude of @xmath100 is interesting in the context of these theories .    from ( [ ei ] )",
    ", we have @xmath101 , and then using ( [ spectral ] ) , we have @xmath102 which is within the range of wmap results @xcite .    thus , we see that our model reproduces the results of the chaotic inflationary scenario",
    ". however , the shape of the potential was not put by hand , rather a gauge theory with a changing coupling constant led naturally to it . moreover , in typical chaotic models , the inflaton field starts from very large values ( @xmath103 ) and ends at around @xmath104 .",
    "one might suspect whether field theory is reliable at such high energies .",
    "nonetheless , this problem is absent in our model since the large values have another meaning in that they just refer to a reduction of the strong coupling by around 10 times during the inflation .",
    "furthermore , chaotic inflations get a typical reheating of order @xmath105 , and one might need to worry about the relic problem . similarly ,",
    "equation ( [ g2ei ] ) leads in our model to a gluon condensate @xmath106 at the start of inflation . from equation ( [ epsevo ] )",
    ", we see that this corresponds to an inflation time interval @xmath107 satisfying the constraint ( [ timecons ] ) .",
    "if the gluon condensate stays constant , as we assumed in our analysis , we will have the same reheating temperature as in chaotic models ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "however , we should compare this value for @xmath0 with its present value renormalized at gut scale @xmath109 which can be calculated knowing its value at @xmath110 @xcite and that the anomalous dimension of @xmath111 is identical ly zero .",
    "we get @xmath112 which represents a decrease of @xmath113 orders of magnitude .",
    "this can give us the following possible picture for an exit scenario .",
    "lacking a clear theory for the non - perturbative dynamical gluon condensate , we consider its value @xmath70 depending on energy , and thus implicitely on cosmological time , as given by the standard rge which turns it off logarithmically at high energy .",
    "however , we can furthermore assume the condensate value to depend explicitely on time during inflation : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the piece determined by the rge . in order that our model be consistent",
    ", the value of @xmath0 at the start of inflation should be very huge and negative .",
    "the unknown function @xmath116 should be such that it varies slowly during most of the inflationary era , to conform with an approximately constant value of @xmath0 , while at the end of inflation it causes a drastic drop of the condensate value @xmath0 to around zero .",
    "the energy release of this helps in reheating the universe , while reaching the value @xmath117 leads to a minute  trace - anomaly \" energy mass density ( equation [ rhot ] ) ending , thus , the inflation .",
    "the other types of energy density would contribute to give the gluon condensate its ` small ' positive value of ( [ condnow ] ) , and the subsequent evolution is just the standard one given by rge .",
    "surely , this phenomenological description needs to be tested and expanded into a theory where the concept of symmetry breaking of such a phase transition for the condensate @xmath0 provides the physical basis for ending the inflation . nonetheless , with a test function of the form @xmath118 with @xmath119",
    ", one can integrate analytically the equation of motion , and in `` slow roll ''",
    "regime we have @xmath120)$ ] with @xmath121 . the graph in fig .",
    "[ figure ] shows the time evolutions of the condensate and the @xmath18-field , which agree with the required features .",
    "this example is meant to be just an existence example , and the temporal dependence of the condensate could be of complete different shape while the whole picture is still self - consistent .",
    "the issue demands a detailed study for the condensate within an underlying theory and we do not further it here .",
