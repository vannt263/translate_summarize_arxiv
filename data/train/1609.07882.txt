    "thermodynamic properties of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions is being actively studied theoretically as well as experimentally .",
    "a first principle approach is provided by the finite temperature formulation of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) on a space - time lattice . for light",
    "quarks these studies  @xcite indicate the possibility of a rapid crossover between the color confined and deconfined states .",
    "the chiral symmetry is also broken / restored spontaneously along with the confinement / deconfinement transition . for the physical case of two light quarks and a heavy strange quark , lattice qcd simulations for zero net conserved charges find this cross - over temperature to be in the range @xmath1 as reported by the hot - qcd  @xcite and wuppertal - budapest  @xcite collaborations .",
    "a cross - over transition does not leave a singular boundary between two different phases . nevertheless , near @xmath2 various thermodynamic quantities exhibit a rapid change .",
    "fluctuations of conserved charges are prominent quantities in this regard  @xcite .",
    "lattice simulation results undoubtedly serve as a benchmark estimate over a large temperature window  @xcite .    at the same time , it is also important to properly explore the qcd phase diagram to get a flavor of the physics at varying regimes of temperature and chemical potential .",
    "in fact an exciting question that has puzzled the community is whether there is any phase transition at non - zero baryon densities for strongly interacting matter .",
    "an interesting possibility associated with this issue is the existence of a critical end point somewhere on the phase diagram .",
    "unfortunately in lattice qcd framework certain technical difficulties arise at the non - zero baryon chemical potentials .",
    "various intelligent techniques exist to circumvent these difficulties to some extent  @xcite .    in this context various qcd inspired models",
    "are found to be useful in describing the aspects of strongly interacting matter at arbitrary temperature and chemical potentials . in the present article",
    "the various thermodynamic properties of strongly interacting matter are investigated within the framework of polyakov loop enhanced nambu@xmath0jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) model .",
    "one of the two key ingredients in the pnjl model is the nambu@xmath0jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite .",
    "this model includes the global symmetries of qcd in the fermionic sector , like the chiral symmetry , baryon number , electric charge , strange number symmetries etc .",
    "the multi - quark interactions in this model are responsible for the dynamical generation of mass , leading to spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "however , the gluon fields being integrated out , this model does not have an adequate mechanism of confinement , especially for non - zero temperatures . to this end",
    "the pnjl model  @xcite gives a sense of confinement by introduction of a temporal background gluon field along with its self interactions mimicking the pure glue effects .",
    "thus by construction both chiral and deconfinement transitions are entwined within a single framework .",
    "interestingly a reasonable parametrization of the pnjl model could be achieved to obtain qualitatively similar results as in lattice qcd framework almost a decade ago  @xcite . since then",
    "several studies were done to analyze the properties of this model as well as to improve the model step by step .",
    "improvements in the model for inclusion of eight - quark interactions in the njl part  @xcite necessary in order to stabilize the ground state , were introduced in  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the first case study of the phase diagram in @xmath3-equilibrium has been reported using the pnjl model . in a recent work  @xcite the su(3 ) color singlet ensemble of a quark - gluon gas has been shown to exhibit a z(3 ) symmetry and within stationary point approximation it becomes equivalent to the polyakov loop ensemble . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that though in general a small amount of mass difference between the two light quarks does not affect the thermodynamics of the system much , it might have a significant effect on baryon - isospin correlations .",
    "studies of various thermodynamic quantities and fluctuation and correlations of conserved charges incorporating finite volume effects have been reported in ref .",
    "also the first model study of the net charge fluctuations in terms of d - measure from the pnjl model  @xcite has been reported . in an interesting exercise",
    ", the validity of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem has been discussed in the context of the pnjl model  @xcite .",
    "as we know , viscous effects play pivotal role in the evolution of the hot and dense system .",
    "study of these effects in terms of transport coefficients have been done in the njl and pnjl model  @xcite and compared with hadron resonance gas studies  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have discussed behavioral pattern of different observables as extracted from the pnjl model .",
    "the qcd phase structure has also been investigated for imaginary chemical potentials in ref .",
    "@xcite under pnjl model framework .",
    "different interesting features of the polyakov loop have instigated the development of different formalisms of the pnjl model  @xcite .",
    "effects of consideration of gluon polyakov loop have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "given that one of the most important application of the pnjl model would be to predict observables for non - zero baryon densities , it is important to at least reproduce observables for zero baryon densities where first principle results from lattice qcd are available .",
    "the qualitative agreement of results in the pnjl model with those available from lattice qcd has so far been quite satisfactory .",
    "the agreement seemed to be more convincing once the temperature dependent observables were plotted against @xmath4 , when @xmath2 in the model was not equal to that obtained on the lattice .",
    "however the lattice data used for these studies were at finite lattice spacings .",
    "recently continuum extrapolations for a number of observables have been reported from lattice simulations .",
    "therefore it is high time that one tries to set model parameters such as to reproduce the quantitative agreement of observables with the lattice results . in the present work we attempt to reset the pnjl model parameters to reproduce the @xmath2 as well as the temperature dependence of pressure as obtained in the continuum limit of lattice qcd .",
    "various other thermodynamic observables may then be obtained from appropriate derivatives of pressure and contrasted against the lattice qcd results .",
    "the parameters we shall modify are the ones for the polyakov loop potential as the parameters of the njl model are fixed at zero temperature and densities .",
    "we organize the manuscript as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the pnjl model focusing on the construction of the effective potential and the constraints on various parameters . in section [ sc.parameter ]",
    "we detail the parameter fixing procedure .",
    "thereafter we present some thermodynamic quantities in section [ sc.thermo ] and discuss the fluctuations and correlations of conserved charges in section [ sc.fluc ] . in the final section we summarize and conclude .",

    ", the polyakov loop explains the deconfinement physics .",

    "the maxima obtained in the model is much larger , wider , as well as shifted towards higher temperatures as compared to the lattice data . as discussed by some of us earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite this is due to the melting of the strange quark condensate at higher temperatures in the pnjl model .",
    "this is possibly an artefact of constraining the njl model parameters to be fixed at values obtained at zero temperature and chemical potentials .",
    "it would be important to investigate the necessary changes in the quark interactions in the njl lagrangian , but is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we now discuss the leading order correlations between the conserved charges .",
    "these are shown as functions of temperature in fig .",
    "[ fg.corr11 ] .",
    "the baryon number to electric charge ( bq ) correlation @xmath45 shows a hump around the crossover region and vanishes for both low and high temperatures . in the hadronic phase the baryon and electric charge",
    "are correlated because baryons have positive electric charge and anti - baryons have negative electric charge .",
    "however their masses being large , the correlations come out to be insignificant .",
    "with increasing temperature however the correlation becomes non - zero . on the other hand in the partonic phase , for the 2 + 1 flavor theory",
    ", there are three quarks with equal baryon number but electric charge of @xmath46 and @xmath47 quarks are together opposite of that of the @xmath48 quark , implying that in this phase the bq correlation is zero .",
    "thus we get the temperature variation of bq correlation as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg.corr11 ] .",
    "we note that the bq correlation in the pnjl model is larger than that obtained in the lattice qcd data .",
    "the baryon number to strangeness ( bs ) correlation @xmath49 as well as the electric charge to strangeness ( qs ) correlation @xmath50 show a order parameter like behavior .",
    "this is because both the correlations are non - zero in hadronic as well as the partonic phases .",
    "the suppression at low temperatures due to large hadronic mass just gets reduced at high temperatures .",
    "for these two correlations we note that pnjl model results are significantly lower than the lattice qcd data .",
    "this is similar to the behavior of the second order strangeness susceptibility @xmath43 , which should be as we discuss below . for these correlators",
    "we find the lattice results to be larger than the pnjl results .",
    "now it seems strange that the correlators at the same order have opposite behavior for @xmath45 versus @xmath49 and @xmath50 , when pnjl model is compared to the lattice qcd data .",
    "let us try to argue how this could naturally arise .",
    "for that we first express the correlators in terms of the fluctuations and correlations in terms of the flavor basis .",
    "the relations are given as ,    @xmath51    where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the second order flavor susceptibilities and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the second order flavor correlations .",
    "we note that if we consider the flavor correlators to be numerically much smaller than the flavor susceptibilities one may again describe the observed behavior of the correlators in fig .",
    "[ fg.corr11 ] .",
    "while @xmath49 and @xmath50 will inherit the order parameter like behavior of @xmath54 , @xmath45 will vary depending on the difference between @xmath52 and @xmath54 .",
    "this may explain the higher value obtained in the pnjl model with respect to lattice qcd data .",
    "to see this we note that in  @xcite some of us discussed the variation of the baryon number to isospin ( bi ) correlation @xmath57 with different current masses for the @xmath48 and @xmath46 quarks in a 2 flavor system . for identical light quark masses , @xmath58 should be zero , but it becomes non - zero when the current masses are different .",
    "it was further discussed that value of @xmath58 is proportional to this mass difference and for small quark masses it has a consistent scaling with the amount of mass splitting . here for @xmath45 a similar situation arises due to the large strange quark current mass difference with that of the light quarks . for the pnjl model we have considered the current quark masses as given in table  [ tb.njlpara ] . for the lattice qcd data the bare quark mass in physical units are found to have an average value of @xmath59 ( with a spread of 2 mev ) , for the temperature range of the data as obtained from table xii of ref .",
    "this difference in the bare masses may account for the difference in bq correlation between pnjl model and the lattice qcd results .",
    "a detailed study in this direction will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the strange quark mass being smaller for the lattice data it is highly conceivable that the second order susceptibilities are higher on the lattice exactly as observed in the behavior of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this would also partially be responsible for the large difference of @xmath43 obtained in the pnjl model and on the lattice .",
    "a proper reparametrization of the njl model with lower current mass for the strange quark may therefore bridge the gap in the various susceptibilities and correlations related to the strangeness sector and will be addressed elsewhere .",
    "qcd in the non - perturbative domain is best realized with lattice qcd simulations which are however very costly .",
    "simpler model approaches are efficient in the extraction of the quantities of interest at arbitrary values of external parameters like temperature , chemical potential etc . which however needs to have reliability validated quantitatively .",
    "in this work we discussed how far the pnjl model is suitable in describing the thermodynamic properties of strongly interacting matter .",
    "recently , lattice qcd simulations have been extrapolated to the continuum limit and almost physical quark masses , obtaining a variety of interesting information for a wide range of temperature .",
    "therefore it seemed timely that a reparametrization of the pnjl model be made to check if it can satisfactorily predict various measured observables on the lattice .",
    "an important observation in the continuum extrapolated lattice results is that the pressure of strongly interacting matter is significantly below that of ideal gas of quarks and gluons even at reasonably large temperatures .",
    "this implies that the gluon mediated interactions must be strong even though the degrees of freedom may have changed from hadronic to partonic ones .",
    "so we chose to reparametrize the polyakov loop self interactions in the pnjl model which is supposed to mimic the gluonic effects .",
    "the njl model parameters were set from hadronic properties at zero temperature and chemical potentials .",
    "we found excellent agreement of the equation of state in the pnjl model with that of lattice qcd data in a wide range of temperatures .",
    "the specific heat has a small peak in the model near the crossover in the model .",
    "though not a prominent peak but a hump is surely present in the lattice qcd data .",
    "the speed of sound agreed with lattice data except for @xmath60 .",
    "the second and fourth order susceptibilities of the baryon number were again found to be in reasonable quantitative agreement with the lattice data .",
    "for the electric charge susceptibilities we found some disagreement for @xmath60 .",
    "the disagreement in this region for speed of sound as well as susceptibilities could possibly be due to absence of light hadrons in the present formulation of the pnjl model .",
    "significant disagreement was observed for baryon - charge , baryon - strangeness and charge - strangeness correlations .",
    "the values were more in the pnjl model for the baryon - charge correlation and opposite for the other correlators .",
    "we argued that this could possibly due to the difference in the bare strange quark masses used in the pnjl model and the lattice formulations . with this argument the opposing discrepancies in the correlators could also be explained .",
    "this could also be partially responsible for the discrepancies in the strangeness susceptibilities .",
    "the most significant disagreement is observed for the fourth order susceptibility of strangeness for @xmath44 .",
    "the slow melting of the strange quark condensate seems to be a major cause for this discrepancy .",
    "thus even though the quantitative agreement of a variety of observables in the pnjl model with the lattice qcd data was found to be encouraging , certain differences still remain . a proper consideration of hadronic excitations and reparametrization of the njl part seems necessary .",
    "we would like to address these issues elsewhere .",
