    "the _ ab initio _ no - core shell model ( ncsm ) permits calculations of wave functions in very large model - space sizes for nuclei at the beginning of the p - shell . for @xmath0li calculations up to 16@xmath7",

    "is its predicted energy spectra of light nuclei @xcite . towards the end of the p - shell",
    "a @xmath8 basis calculation has been achieved for a=11 @xcite . in mass 12",
    "the model provides a reasonable description of the low - momentum component of the vector and axial currents involved in the electro - weak transitions to the ground state on @xmath1n when a three - body interaction is included @xcite . in all of these calculations , a lee - suzuki @xcite transformation of the nucleon - nucleon interaction",
    "is used to account for the restricted nature of the space in terms of an effective interaction .",
    "group theoretical analyses @xcite of the no - core shell model wave functions have shown that the predicted eigenstates of @xmath1c and @xmath9o have very large overlaps with a small sub - space of the full model space , with the sub - space being defined by the most deformed symplectic basis states .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine the structure of the multi-@xmath10 terms in the wave functions for the low - lying states at the beginning and end of the @xmath11-shell in more detail .",
    "for this we compare ncsm predictions with measured elastic and inelastic @xmath3 charge form factors in @xmath0li and @xmath1c .",
    "the shape of the electron scattering form factors provides a direct probe of the magnitude and structure of the higher shell components in the wave functions .",
    "the charge form factors have the additional advantage that two - body meson - exchange currents do not contribute significantly to the form factors below about 2 @xmath12 @xcite . in all @xmath3 calculations presented here",
    "we use a bare one - body operator ; as discussed below , the introduction of an effective operator ( to compensate for the truncated model space ) does not significantly affect our conclusions .",
    "our first main finding is that the @xmath2 amplitudes that contribute significantly to electron scattering appear with the opposite sign to that needed to replicate the experimental form factors , elastic and inelastic , and the charge radii .",
    "the 2@xmath10 contributions to the inelastic form factor change sign , in agreement with experiment , for sufficiently large model spaces for @xmath0li ; however , higher - order terms do not within the model spaces we examined .",
    "second we show that the symplectic @xmath13 , @xmath14 = 2 @xmath2 amplitudes in the wave functions are sensitive functions of the oscillator parameter .",
    "the ground state c0 form factor is the fourier transform of the charge density , and contributions from two - body charge operators and/or relativistic corrections are negligible for momenta up to about 2 @xmath15 @xcite . in a harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis , the @xmath16 @xmath11-shell charge form factor is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the oscillator parameter .",
    "when additional shells are added to the model space the new contributions to the form factor fall into two main classes .",
    "the first of these are the _ in - shell _ contributions ( e.g. @xmath20 , etc . ) determined by the occupation numbers for the higher shells , and the second are from _ cross - shell _ @xmath2 excitations ( e.g. @xmath21 , @xmath22 , etc . ) . at low @xmath23 the form factor is determined by the charge radius    @xmath24    and the higher in - shell contributions can be shown _",
    "always _ to add constructively to the charge radius .",
    "the cross - shell excitations ( which for ho wave functions contribute to the charge radius only for @xmath25 excitations across two shells ) can add constructively or destructively . in a @xmath26 calculation for p - shell nuclei",
    "there are two possible cross - shell contributions , namely ,    @xmath27    @xmath28 both of these transform under su(3 ) as @xmath5 and represent the @xmath26 symplectic contributions to the form factors .",
    "when these and/or higher shell @xmath4 @xmath2 excitations appear with a sign so as to enhance the predicted charge radius , they pull in the charge form factor in momentum space .",
    "both elastic and inelastic scattering from @xmath0li have been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "our calculations use the cd bonn nucleon - nucleon interaction @xcite .",
    "the predicted ground state energy of @xmath0li is least sensitive to the choice of the oscillator parameter @xmath19 over increasing basis size for @xmath19 = 1.79 fm ( @xmath10 = 13 mev ) @xcite , which is the value we use in the present ( e , e ) calculations .",
    "we note that , because of the increased computational difficulties in calculating the transition density matrix elements needed for the ( e , e ) form factors , the present calculations are restricted to a maximum model space of @xmath29 , to be compared with the 16@xmath10 model spaces used to calculate the energy spectra for @xmath0li .",

    "in coordinate space the predicted charge density ( figure 2 ) is enhanced in the interior , with little change to the tail as higher shells are added .",
    "these trends reflect the structure and sign of @xmath2 excitations introduced as the model space increases .",
    "there are two issues with the structure of the predicted ground state @xmath2 excitations .",
    "first , the @xmath30 @xmath2 excitation for all shells included add destructively to the ground state charge radius .",
    "these suggest that the sign of the important symplectic excitations in the wave functions may be problematic . in momentum - space",
    "these excitations pull the form factor out in @xmath23 .",
    "second , there are large @xmath31 excitations which pull the form factor out further at higher @xmath23 .",
    "these effects are shown in figures 3 and 4 , where the relevant @xmath2 one - body density matrix elements have been arbitrarily set to zero for the purposes of displaying their effect on the shape of the predicted form factor .    in table 1",
    "we show the contributions to the charge radius from in - shell versus cross - shell excitations , and the destructive interference from the @xmath2 excitations is larger than the constructive interference from the higher in - shell excitations .",
    "this suggests that the predicted sign of the @xmath32 @xmath33 excitations that transform under su(3 ) as @xmath34)=(2,0 ) inhibits the convergence of the calculations .",

    "the main problem arises because matrix elements of the kinetic energy ( @xmath90 ) and the two - body interaction ( @xmath91 ) across two shells ( @xmath92 ) are large and opposite in sign , and they can not be calculated reliably .",

    "the large 0@xmath102 ( and 0@xmath103 for @xmath1c ) amplitudes , introduced by the lee - suzuki transformation , also affect the shape of the form factors , further increasing the magnitude of the form factors at high momentum transfers .",
    "in the larger model spaces we explored for @xmath0li , the sign of the 2@xmath10 contributions to the inelastic form factor changes , but convergence onto experiment is slow .",
    "the second main finding is the strong dependence of the magnitude and sign of the off diagonal @xmath14 = 2 matrix elements of @xmath104 on the oscillator parameter . as a result",
    ", the observables ( the c2 form factor , gmr , gqr ) also heavily depend on the choice of oscillator parameter .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath2 configurations in the low lying wave functions appear with an unexpected sign . these results indicates a lack of self - consistency in the ncsm similar to that found in the standard ho shell model . while there is no known solution ,",
    "the effects may be minimized by including a hartree - fock condition in the calculations a prescription @xcite used in ho shell model calculations is to invoke the following condition : @xmath105 certainly this method bears further investigation .",

    "<S> we study the structure of the no - core shell model wave functions for @xmath0li and @xmath1c by investigating the ground state and first excited state electron scattering charge form factors . in both nuclei , large particle - hole ( @xmath2 ) amplitudes in the wave functions appear with the opposite sign to that needed to reproduce the shape of the @xmath3 form factors , the charge radii , and the b(e2 ) values for the lowest two states . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in sign appears to arise mainly from the monopole @xmath4 matrix elements of the kinetic and potential energy ( t+v ) that transform under the harmonic oscillator su(3 ) symmetries as @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> these are difficult to determine self - consistently , but they have a strong effect on the structure of the low - lying states and on the giant monopole and quadrupole resonances . </S>",
    "<S> the lee - suzuki transformation , used to account for the restricted nature of the space in terms of an effective interaction , introduces large higher - order @xmath62 , @xmath2 amplitudes in the wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> the latter @xmath2 excitations aggravate the disagreement between the experimental and predicted @xmath3 form factors with increasing model spaces , especially at high momentum transfers . for sufficiently large model spaces </S>",
    "<S> the situation begins to resolve itself for @xmath0li , but the convergence is slow . a prescription to constrain the @xmath2 excitations would likely accelerate convergence of the calculations . </S>"
