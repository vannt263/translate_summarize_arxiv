    "zirconia ( @xmath0 ) is a hard and usually colorless material with a wide range of technological applications@xcite .",
    "being corrosion resistant it is used as a dental material and because of its low cost , durability , and close visual likeness to diamond , it is widely used to synthesize artificial gems .",
    "it is used as a thermal barrier in coating engines due to its high resistance .",
    "the addition of cations ( as for example @xmath1 ) induces the generation of oxygen vacancies for charge compensation which makes it useful as oxygen sensor .",
    "moreover zirconia is an high dielectric constant ( high-@xmath2 ) material with potential applications in the micro  electronics .",
    "finally , very recently , transition  metals doped zirconia has been predicted to be a dilute magnetic semiconductor ( dms ) with high curie temperature @xmath3 with potential applications in the field of spintronics  @xcite ; while pure and doped @xmath0 has been proposed as a candidate material for resistive switching memories devices  @xcite ( reram ) exploiting the high vacancies mobility of the system .",
    "pure @xmath0 exhibits at ambient pressure three polymorphisms .",
    "the monoclinic ( m ) phase is stable at low temperature and is the less symmetric structure with the @xmath4 ions exhibiting sevenfold coordination .",
    "between 1440 and 2640 k the tetragonal ( t ) phase , with eightfold coordinated @xmath4 ions is stable . finally above 2640 k , till melting temperature ( @xmath5k ) , the most symmetric cubic ( c ) phase is stabilized@xcite .",
    "the only difference between the ( c ) and the ( t ) phase is a distortion of the oxygen sub  lattice with a spontaneous symmetry breaking . the ( t ) and ( c ) phases are more used in technological applications and both the ( t)/(c ) structures and the ( t ) @xmath6 ( c ) doping induced phase transition ( dipt ) have been well characterized in the literature both form the theoretical and the experimental point of view  @xcite , with @xmath1 ions the most used and studied dopants .",
    "on the other hand the ( m ) @xmath6 ( t ) dipt is much less characterized , especially from the theoretical point of view .",
    "it presents a volume change of about @xmath7 that causes extensive cracking in the material .",
    "this behavior destroys the mechanical properties of fabricated components and makes pure zirconia useless for structural or mechanical application .",
    "moreover the ( t ) phase , is metastable in pure and lightly doped @xmath0 over a very long time ; a growth sample of doped zirconia must be annealed in order to check if the reached tetragonal phase is stable or meta  stable .",
    "hence a better understanding of the ( m ) @xmath6 ( t ) dipt is desirable . in this paper",
    "we address the problem from a first principle perspective and , in particular , we show that the dipt is a balance of the mean field ( mf ) description ( i.e. kinetic plus electrostatic : @xmath8 $ ] ) with exchange  correlation effects which can not be captured by simplified models .",

    "[ fig : zro2+y_and_vac ] for more details ) for different doping concentrations .",
    "a correct modelling of the material must consider the possible relative positions of the dopants ( as substitutional defects ) and the vacancies .",
    "we found out that the relative position of y atoms among themselves plays a minor role , in agreement with the other works  @xcite , and in our system we kept these as far as possible to mimic uniform doping .",
    "instead the position of vacancies respect to y atoms or to other vacancies influences significantly the total energy of the system .",
    "stapper et al.@xcite reported that in the cubic system isolated vacancies tend to be next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) to @xmath24 atoms with an energy gain of @xmath25 ev per vacancy against the nearest neighbor ( nn ) configuration in a supercell with 1 @xmath24 atom and 1 vacancy .",
    "this result is confirmed also by ostanin et al.@xcite in a supercell with 2 @xmath24 atoms and 1 vacancy with @xmath26 ev between the two configurations @xmath27-@xmath28-@xmath29 and @xmath27-@xmath28-@xmath30 in favor of the second in the ( c ) phase and @xmath31 ev in the ( t ) phase .",
    "also in the present work we found @xmath32 ev considering 1 vacancy and 2 @xmath24 atoms .    in the ( m )",
    "phase two nonequivalent oxygen atoms exist , one with coordination @xmath33 and another with coordination @xmath34 , and , accordingly there are four possible configurations .",

    "no results have been reported in the literature about the position of vacancies in the ( m ) phase .    the most favored configuration , for both the ( t ) and the ( m ) phase , is represented in fig .  [ fig : structures ] , together with the forces acting on each atom in the initial geometry of pure @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath24 ions are not attracted by the oxygen vacancies and indeed in the ( m ) phase they are pushed away from the vacancy .",
    "hence both the analysis of the energetically favored configuration and the internal relaxation of the ions does not follow the intuitive scheme of charged defects with the vacancies a @xmath41 and the @xmath24 ion a @xmath42 charged sites , suggesting that exchange ",
    "correlation effects play a role in the stabilization mechanism .    also the relative vacancy ",
    "vacancy orientation and position is in contrast with an electrostatic based model . in the ( c)/(t )",
    "phase , while stapper et al.@xcite based their calculation on the assumption that oxygen vacancies should remain as far as possible , ostanin et al.@xcite results suggest that oxygen vacancies tend to couple along the @xmath43 $ ] direction with a single @xmath18 ion in between , thus at a relative distance of about @xmath44  . also experimental x  ray data  @xcite seems to support this idea .",
    "no data about the orientation of oxygen vacancies in the ( m ) phase is present in the literature .    changing the relative position of di  vacancy complex in our model ( i.e. two vacancy at @xmath45 ) we found differences in total energy of @xmath46 ev ( per di  vacancy ) .",
    "the oscillations in the mean field ( mf ) , i.e. the sum of the kinetic  @xcite and electrostatic energy , and the exchange  correlation ( xc ) component of the energy are much more pronounced , with @xmath47 ev and @xmath48 ev",
    ". we will discuss this more in detail in the next section .",
    "our results are , in some aspects , different from the ones suggested by the two cited works .",
    "indeed we found that , while vacancies does not repel , the configuration suggested as most favorable for the ( t ) structure by ostanin et al.@xcite , is not the lowest in energy .",
    "indeed , surprisingly , the latter comes out to be unstable , with one of the two vacancies which changes position if we let the system relax ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vacancy_moves ] ) .",
    "this last result suggests that , in presence of vacancies , oxygen atoms can move with ( nearly ) no potential barrier to overcome .",
    "this is a theoretical evidence that ysz is a good ionic conductor .",
    "indeed this property is important for many applications and has been investigated in other works  @xcite .",
    "we also considered some cases at atomic doping concentrations of @xmath49 and one test case at @xmath50 . both for @xmath45 and @xmath49",
    "there is a huge number of possible relative position of the oxygens and we did not try to systematically explore which is the best configuration . at @xmath51",
    "the best found configuration has two vacancies aligned in the @xmath52 plane .",
    "a simple explanation of this fact could be provided considering the axial anisotropy of the dielectric constant ( @xmath2 ) of the ( t ) phase .",
    "the component @xmath53 are larger than the @xmath54 , thus providing a more effective screening of charged oxygen vacancies placed along the @xmath52 plane .",
    "however we did not find this to be the sole mechanism , as some of the other configurations with the vacancies aligned in the @xmath52 plane have higher energy than some configurations with the vacancies aligned , for example , in the @xmath55 plane .    to conclude this section , the behavior of the oxygen vacancies present some differences , and some similarities , between the two phases of zirconia .",
    "a key important difference however is that the formation of vacancies is more favored in the ( t ) phase than in the ( m ) phase as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : vac_energy ] .",
    "this fact indeed implies that @xmath23 doping tends to stabilize the ( t ) phase .       doping ( black circles ) .",
    "the result is not simply the sum of the effect induced by @xmath24 doping without vacancies ( violet triangles , dot dashed line for the linear fit ) and oxygen vacancies without yttrium ( green squares , dashed line for the linear fit ) . when no yttrium is present the value of the @xmath57 coordinate",
    "is chosen so that the number of vacancies for the @xmath23 doping case is equal to the number of vacancies for the oxygen vacancies only case . in the bottom panels the variations in the total energy as a function of the configurations is compared with the variations in the mean field and exchange  correlation energy .",
    "the pink shadowed area are a guide for the eyes , to highlight the trend of the two energy components.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    the configuration explored allow to model the ( m)@xmath6(t ) dipt as a function of the yttria doping . in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_total ] we see that the energy difference between the ( t ) and the ( m ) phase decrease increasing the doping concentration .",
    "this is a clear signature that we are correctly describing the dipt .",
    "however the stabilization of the ( t ) phase happens , after a linear fit of our data , at higher doping concentration , @xmath58% , than the experimental value @xmath59%",
    "the main error is due to an overestimation of the zero  doping energy difference of @xmath60 ev / m.u .",
    "( @xmath61 ev / m.u .",
    "@xcite while @xmath62 ev / mu.u . ) .",
    "indeed it is reasonable to assume that the trend of the energy difference is better computed than its absolute value and accordingly assuming a constant `` zero  doping error '' for every @xmath24 concentration we can subtract it ( the zero energy in fig .  [",
    "fig : e_total ] shifts from the black line to the blue line ) obtaining @xmath63 , which is in excellent agreement with the experimental value .",
    "similar results are obtained if one consider , instead of the linear fit , the energy difference between the two best configurations ( orange dashed line in fig .",

    "the ( green ) shadowed regions highlight the regions around an oxygen vacancy ( small black sphere in center of the region ) , where @xmath65 is different from zero.,scaledwidth=99.0% ]    for the pure @xmath0 we have also computed the contribution to the helmholtz free energy due to thermal excitations of phonons .",
    "we found that the difference in the thermal contribution is negligible at room temperature , while the difference of the zero point phonon energy between the two phases is @xmath66 ev / m.u .",
    ", with a small effect on the value of @xmath67 ( in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_total ] this amounts to the shift of the zero from the dashed to the continuous line ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare how the mean field energy , @xmath68=t[\\rho]+v^{ext}+v_h[\\rho]$ ] , and the exchange  correlation energy , @xmath69 $ ] , change considering different configurations . in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_total ] , bottom panels , we see that the two component oscillate about 10 times more than the total energy as a function of the chosen atomic configuration .",
    "the mean field energy , in pure @xmath0 , is lower in the ( t ) phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig : e_total ] , central bottom panel ) ; that is , if the xc  energy is neglected , the ( t ) phase is thermodynamically the most stable .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath24 doping and oxygen vacancies enhance this aspect as , on average @xmath70 , with @xmath57 the atomic doping content and @xmath71 .",
    "this is likely because the tetragonal phase , which has an higher dielectric constant , better screens the electrostatic perturbation @xmath72 induced by the doping  @xcite .    in order to have a picture of the screening effect we have defined ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_pol ] and caption ) the polarization charge , that is the difference in the electronic density between the pure and the doped system . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_pol ] we see that the main perturbation is induced by the oxygen vacancies .",
    "the screening mechanism however is very efficient and accordingly the value of the polarization charge is sensibly different from zero only on the atoms nn to the vacancies .",
    "the @xmath56energy in pure @xmath0 instead is lower in the ( m ) phase and on average @xmath73 . to understand this point we consider the perturbations induced in the electronic part of the hamiltonian of pure @xmath0 , that is @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the additional perturbation generated from the dislocation of the atoms .",
    "@xmath76 has the shape of a random potential in a perfect periodic system which tends to destroy the collective behavior of the electron gas and thus electrons lose correlation .",
    "this is not an `` on site '' correlation , but rather a `` ranged '' correlation energy and so we expect that gga can better describe this effect than lda .",
    "while @xmath72 is similar for the two phases , i.e. we are considering the same kind of doping , the @xmath75 term is greater in the ( t ) phase due to its higher screening ( see note ) . accordingly the @xmath56energy is more penalized , that is @xmath77 .",
    "this explains @xmath73 and thus we can infer that in the screening process electrons lose @xmath56energy .",
    "the emerging picture is that the ( m ) @xmath6 ( t ) dipt is a balance between different mechanisms with a key role played by vacancies  @xcite , though the role of yttrium atoms is not only to induce vacancies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : e_total ] and caption ) .",
    "the phase transition of zirconia induced with yttria doping is very well known experimentally and indeed yttria stabilized zirconia is commonly used in many applications .",
    "our results show that an ab ",
    "initio approach is able to correctly describe this mechanism , with a predicted phase transition at a doping concentration of @xmath78 , in good agreement with experimental data .",
    "this result confirms the opportunity to predict the effect of other less characterize kind of doping which could be of potential interest for new applications , as for example doping with magnetic materials  @xcite .",
    "moreover , within density functional theory we can explore how physical properties of the system are influenced by doping . as an example we considered how different components of the energy changes and in particular the behavior of the exchange  correlation energy .",
    "we showed that oxygen defects play a major role in the phase transition and how the perturbation induced by oxygen vacancies to the system is screened in the high - k tetragonal phase .",
    "the same approach could be used to check the effect of doping on other quantities , which are not easily accessible experimentally ; among others , the value of the dielectric constant , which has a key importance for applications in the field of micro  electronics .",
    "finally these results , improving our understanding of the phase transition , can also be used to tune the parameters of models for the description of realistic devices based on zirconia , whose dimensions are still beyond the capabilities of first  principles simulations .",
