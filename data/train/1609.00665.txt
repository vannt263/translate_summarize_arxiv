    "since its isolation on an adhesive tape  @xcite , graphene has quickly become a material of intensive attention .",
    "many researches have revealed various interesting aspects of the material ; see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews .",
    "one of the most interesting features emerges particularly when we apply a magnetic field to it  @xcite .",
    "the landau levels due to the magnetic field form a structure different from the simple two - dimensional electron gas in that there are levels of zero energy and in that the non - zero energy levels are spaced not equally but proportionally to the square root of the level number .      in the present paper",
    ", we apply to graphene yet another ingredient of recent interest , namely the @xmath0 symmetry  @xcite . in order to attract attention of condensed - matter physicists ,",
    "let us briefly describe the @xmath0 symmetry here .",
    "it refers to the parity - and - time symmetry of a hamiltonian .",
    "the simplest example of the @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian may be the two - by - two matrix @xmath4 which we can interpret as a two - site tight - binding model : the two sites are coupled with a real coupling parameter @xmath5 ; the first site has a complex potential @xmath6 , which can represent injection of particles from the environment , because the amplitude of the wave vector would increase in time as @xmath7 if the site were isolated ; the potential @xmath8 of the second site can represent removal of the particles to the environment .",
    "the @xmath9 operator swaps the first and second sites , which is represented by the linear operator @xmath10 the @xmath11 operator is complex conjugation , which is an anti - linear operator .",
    "it is easy to confirm that the hamiltonian @xmath12 in eq .",
    "satisfies @xmath13 the parity operation @xmath9 swaps @xmath6 and @xmath8 but the time operation @xmath11 switches them back to the original .",
    "this is what we mean by the @xmath0 symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath12 has the eigenvalues @xmath14 which are real for @xmath15 , although @xmath12 is non - hermitian ; @xmath16 . for @xmath17 ,",
    "on the other hand , the eigenvalues become complex ( pure imaginary in this specific model ) .",
    "this transition between real and complex eigenvalues physically means the following . in the strong - coupling case @xmath15",
    ", the particles injected to the first site can flow abundantly into the second site , where they are removed at the same rate as the injection .",
    "this constitutes a stationary state of a constant flow , which is indicated by the reality of the eigenvalues . in the weak - coupling case @xmath17 ,",
    "on the other hand , the particles tend to build up in the first site , while they keep becoming scarcer in the second site .",
    "this instability is indicated by the non - reality of the eigenvalues .",
    "the first situation is often called the @xmath0-symmetric phase , whereas the second one is the @xmath0-broken phase .    at the transition point @xmath18 , not only the two eigenvalues coalesce with each other , but the corresponding two eigenvectors become parallel .",
    "this is therefore not the standard degeneracy , but often called an exceptional point  @xcite , which has a huge literature recently , including experimental studies  @xcite . at the exceptional point ,",
    "the eigenvectors are not complete and the hamiltonian @xmath12 is not diagonalizable .",
    "( in fact , non - hermitian matrices are _ generally diagonalizable _ except at the exceptional points . )    the transition at an exceptional point between the two phases indeed happens in a very wide class of @xmath0-symmetric operators .",
    "suppose that a general @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian has an eigenvector @xmath19 with an eigenvalue @xmath20 : @xmath21 inserting the symmetry relation  , we have @xmath22 where we used the fact @xmath23 . when the eigenvalue @xmath20 is real , the operator @xmath0 passes it , yielding @xmath24 which means that @xmath25 is also an eigenvector with the same eigenvalue .",
    "if we assume no degeneracy of the eigenvalue @xmath20 for simplicity , we conclude that @xmath26 ; indeed , we can choose the phase of @xmath19 so that we can make @xmath27 ; namely , the eigenvector is @xmath0-symmetric .",
    "this is what happens in the @xmath0-symmetric phase .",
    "when the eigenvalue @xmath20 is complex , on the other hand , we have , instead of eq .  , @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath20 .",
    "this means that we always have a complex - conjugate pair of eigenvalues @xmath20 and @xmath29 with the eigenvectors @xmath19 and @xmath25 ; each eigenvector is not @xmath0-symmetric anymore in spite of the fact that the hamiltonian is still @xmath0-symmetric .",
    "this is what happens in the @xmath0-broken phase . in typical situations including the example  ,",
    "two neighboring real eigenvalues in the @xmath0-symmetric phase , as we tune system parameters , are attracted to each other , collide at the exceptional point , and then become a pair of complex - conjugate eigenvalues in the @xmath0-broken phase , which repel each other ; see fig .",

    "-symmetric and @xmath0-broken phases .",
    "as we tune system parameters from the @xmath0-symmetric phase to the exceptional point and further on to the @xmath0-broken phase , two real eigenvalues neighboring on the real axis are attracted to each other ( indicated by the blue horizontal arrows on the real axis ) , collide at the exceptional point ( indicated by a green dot ) , and become a complex - conjugate pair , which repel each other ( indicated by the red vertical arrows).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    questions of interest include the following : is it possible to formulate a standardized quantum mechanics for non - hermitian but @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians with real energy eigenvalues , namely in the @xmath0-symmetric phase ? what is the general theoretical structure of the @xmath0-broken phase , on the other hand ?",
    "a more specific subject of study is to find @xmath0-symmetric models that describe physically interesting situations .    in the present paper",
    ", we introduce the potential @xmath6 to one sublattice of graphene under a magnetic field and the potential @xmath8 to its other sublattice , which constitutes a @xmath0-symmetric situation .",
    "it is quite common to introduce a staggered chemical potential to graphene , that is , @xmath30 to one sublattice and @xmath31 to the other sublattice , which may be indeed realized by hexagonal lattice of boron - nitride  @xcite , in which boron atoms are on the a sublattice and nitride atoms are on the b sublattice .",
    "our @xmath0-symmetric situation may be also realized in the following way : suppose that we put a hexagonal lattice of two elements , such as boron - nitride , on a substrate ; assume that the substrate is an electron - doping material for one element but hole - doing for the other",
    ". this can materialize our @xmath0-symmetric situation .    for completeness",
    ", we should observe that few other @xmath0 , or non - hermitian , versions of the graphene have been proposed in recent years , but in a different spirit with respect to ours @xcite .",

    "graphene forms a hexagonal lattice , which is a bipartite lattice ; see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .        a unit cell , indicated by red broken lines in fig .  [ fig2 ] , consists of two sites , one on the a sublattice and the other on the b sublattice . if we assume that the electrons , specifically @xmath32 electrons , hop only to nearest - neighbor lattice points , those on a site on the a sublattice hop only to sites on the b sublattice , and vice versa .",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian in the real - space representation therefore is of the following form : on the diagonal , we have two - by - two blocks @xmath33 which is the local hamiltonian inside a unit cell with the chemical potentials @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the a and b sublattices , respectively , and with the non - zero off - diagonal intra - unit - cell hopping elements @xmath36 between the two sites . in addition , the total hamiltonian has the inter - unit - cell hopping elements @xmath36 between different unit cells .    by fourier",
    "transforming the basis set with respect to the unit cells , we end up with the block - diagonalized hamiltonian @xmath37 with @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are indicated in fig .",

    "because the fermi energy for graphene is zero , these points control the elementary excitation of graphene .",

    "first , the spectrum is quantized to the landau levels under a magnetic field . focusing on the dirac cones around the @xmath1 and @xmath2 points , we can write down the effective hamiltonian as in eq .   below . as is well studied ( see e.g.  ref .",

    "[ sec3 ] that the landau levels are then spaced proportionally to @xmath49 ( after proper parameter normalization ) under a set of biorthogonal eigenstates .",
    "therefore , as we increase the potential @xmath3 , two landau levels labeled by @xmath58 approach each other , collide with each other when @xmath59 , which is an exceptional point , and then split into a pair of two pure imaginary eigenvalues @xmath60 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig4](c  d ) .",
    "we will deduce that at this exceptional point , the eigenvectors of the two landau levels become parallel , which makes the set of biorthogonal eigenstates incomplete . note that each landau level still has an infinite number of degeneracy because of the other quantum number @xmath61 .",

    ", @xmath86 appears particularly simple .",
    "indeed , we find @xmath87 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "note that @xmath91 and @xmath92 are different expressions of the same hamiltonian  .",
    "it is evident that @xmath93 , and a similar conclusion can also be deduced for @xmath70 .",
    "it is also clear that neither @xmath91 nor @xmath94 depends on @xmath95 and @xmath96 , so that their eigenstates possess a manifest degeneracy .",
    "the same is true for @xmath92 nor @xmath97 , which do not depend on @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "however , from now on , we will essentially concentrate on @xmath100 and @xmath94 , except for what is discussed in appendix b. most of what we are going to discuss from now on can be restated easily for @xmath101 and @xmath97 .",
    "for instance , the eigenvectors of @xmath101 could be found from those of @xmath94 , replacing the operators @xmath95 and @xmath96 with @xmath98 and @xmath99 , and vice versa .",
    "now , let @xmath102 be the non - zero vacuum of @xmath95 and @xmath98 : @xmath103",
    ". then we introduce , as usual , @xmath104 the set @xmath105 is an orthonormal basis for @xmath78 , being the same as the one for a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator .    rather than working in @xmath78 , in order to deal with",
    "@xmath91 it is convenient to work in a different hilbert space , namely the direct sum of @xmath78 with itself , @xmath106 : @xmath107 in the new hilbert space @xmath108 , the scalar product @xmath109 is defined as @xmath110 and the square norm is @xmath111 , for all @xmath112 , @xmath113 in @xmath108 .",
    "introducing now the vectors @xmath114 we have an orthonormal basis set @xmath115 for @xmath108 .",
    "this means , among other things , that @xmath116 is complete in @xmath108 : the only vector @xmath117 which is orthogonal to all the vectors of @xmath116 is the zero vector .    in view of application",
    "to graphene it is more convenient to use a different orthonormal basis of @xmath108 , the set @xmath118 , where @xmath119 quite often , in the rest of the paper , we call this vector simply @xmath120 . for @xmath121 ,",
    "we have @xmath122 it is easy to check that these vectors are mutually orthogonal , normalized in @xmath108 , and complete .",
    "hence , @xmath123 is an orthonormal basis , as stated before .",
    "this is not surprising , since its vectors are indeed the eigenvectors of @xmath91 : @xmath124 where @xmath125 .",
    "more compactly we can simply write @xmath126 .",
    "we see explicitly that the eigenvalues have an infinite degeneracy with respect to the quantum number @xmath61 , which can be removed by using the angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "we will not consider this aspect here , since it is not relevant for us .",
    "of course , both @xmath116 and @xmath123 can be used to produce two different resolutions of the identity .",

    "* remark : * what we have seen so far can be easily adapted to the analysis of the hamiltonian for the other dirac cone , @xmath94 , which is simply the transpose of @xmath91 , and , as we have already pointed out , also to @xmath92 and @xmath97 .",
    "we will say more on the other dirac cone in sec .",
    "[ sec3.2 ] , in the presence of the @xmath0-symmetric potential .",

    "( [ 23 ] ) as follows : @xmath128 where @xmath3 is assumed to be a strictly positive ( real ) quantity .",
    "as we show the details in [ appb ] , for @xmath62 , the _ set _ of dirac cones at @xmath1 and @xmath2 are time - reversal symmetric as well as parity symmetric . for @xmath129",
    ", it observes neither symmetries but does the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "an easy extension of the standard arguments allows us to deduce that the general expression of the eigenvectors are still , as in the case with @xmath62 , of the form ( [ 28 ] ) , but with some essential difference , which is also reflected in the form of the eigenvalues .",
    "in particular we first find that @xmath130 which reduces to the known value if @xmath131 , and which is still independent of @xmath61 .",
    "a major difference appears as follows : if @xmath132 , then the values of the energy are real ; we are in the @xmath0-symmetric region .",
    "as soon as @xmath133 , however , the energy turns out to be complex , and we are in the @xmath0-broken region .",
    "we will come back to this later on .",
    "going now to the eigenvectors , we first observe that @xmath134 is an eigenvector of @xmath135 with the eigenvalue @xmath136 . on the other hand",
    ", we can prove that there is no non - zero eigenstate corresponding to @xmath137 .",
    "in fact , if we assume that such a non - zero vector @xmath138 does exist , it must satisfy the equation @xmath139 , which implies in turn that @xmath140 and @xmath141 should satisfy the equations @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "acting on this last with @xmath98 and using the first , we obtain @xmath144 , so that @xmath145 and therefore @xmath146 . then we have @xmath147 for this last equality to be satisfied , we must have @xmath148 . hence @xmath141 must be zero . the fact that @xmath149 also is now a consequence of the equality above @xmath143 , at least if @xmath129 .",
    "then the trivial vector @xmath150 is the only solution that satisfies the equation @xmath139 . in the limit @xmath62 ,",
    "on the other hand , the equation @xmath143 does not imply that @xmath149 and in fact a nontrivial ground state in this case does exist , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sectsam ] .",
    "the reason for this is that , if @xmath62 , there is no difference between @xmath151 and @xmath152 , which are both zero .    as for the levels with @xmath121 ,",
    "the normalized eigenstates are deformed versions of those in eq .",
    "( [ 28 ] ) .",
    "more in detail , defining the following quantities , which are in general complex , @xmath153 we can write @xmath154 with these definitions we have @xmath155    it is easy to see what happens for @xmath156 , since this can be recovered from @xmath135 just replacing everywhere @xmath3 with @xmath157 .",
    "in particular , since the eigenvalues are quadratic in @xmath3 , @xmath135 and @xmath156 turn out to be isospectral . concerning the eigenstates ,",
    "these are deduced from the eigenvectors @xmath158 just with the same substitution .",
    "more in details , calling @xmath159 for all @xmath121 , we can write @xmath160 and @xmath161    analogously to what happens for @xmath135 , only one ground state of @xmath156 does exist , which coincides with @xmath162 above . however , the corresponding eigenvalue is now @xmath137 , so that we conclude that @xmath163 . on the other hand ,",
    "no non - zero eigenvector does exist which corresponds to @xmath136 .",
    "we thus deduce a similar situation with respect to the one observed for @xmath135 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the case @xmath50 is really exceptional ; indeed we have @xmath164 , while neither @xmath165 nor @xmath166 do exist .",
    "this should be remembered in the rest of the paper , since all the formulas considered from now on , and in particular those in section [ sec3.1 ] , are valid only when these particular vectors are not involved .",
    "* remarks : * ( i ) in the limit @xmath167 , all the result reduces to the ones discussed in sec .",
    "[ sectsam ] .",
    "in particular the fact that @xmath163 agrees with the fact that , in this limit , @xmath168 . it is also interesting to observe that the coefficients @xmath169 and @xmath170 simply returns @xmath171 or @xmath172 , as in formula ( [ 28 ] ) .",
    "( ii ) the choice of normalization in ( [ 35 ] ) and ( [ 38 ] ) is such that @xmath173 .",
    "we prefer this choice , rather than the one which could also be used which makes the scalar product between @xmath158 and @xmath174 equal to unity , since this biorthogonality strongly refer to the value of @xmath3 .",
    "this will be evident in the next section .",
    "let us call @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "because of their particular forms and because of the orthogonality of the vectors @xmath177 , it is clear that @xmath178 for all @xmath179 , and for all choices of @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "it is also possible to check that , @xmath182 therefore , eigenstates of @xmath135 corresponding to different eigenvalues are not mutually orthogonal .",
    "this is not surprising , since @xmath135 is not hermitian in the present settings .",
    "however , we can check that the orthogonality is recovered when @xmath3 is sent to zero , i.e. , when @xmath135 becomes hermitian .",
    "what still remains , as quite often in situations like ours , is the possible biorthogonality of the sets @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "in fact , this is not so automatic , and needs some care .",
    "the point is the following : if @xmath12 is not hermitian but two of its eigenvalues @xmath185 and @xmath186 are real , then the states @xmath187 and @xmath188 that satisfy @xmath189 and @xmath190 are guaranteed to be mutually orthogonal .",
    "if @xmath185 or @xmath186 , or both , are complex , on the other hand , this is no longer granted in general .",
    "we will show that in our particular situation of the @xmath0-broken region , the biorthogonality of the sets @xmath183 and @xmath184 is recovered only when properly pairing the eigenstates .",
    "first we observe that @xmath191 can only be different from zero if @xmath192 .",
    "otherwise these scalar products are all zero .",
    "now , if we compute @xmath193 for instance , we deduce that , neglecting an unnecessary multiplication factor , @xmath194 the result of this computation depends on the values of @xmath58 and @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , we can check that for @xmath132 , we have @xmath195 , but for @xmath196 this is not true .",
    "hence @xmath197 similarly we can check that @xmath198 is zero for @xmath132 , but is not zero otherwise .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that a completely opposite result is deduced in the @xmath0-broken region , i.e.  for purely imaginary eigenvalues .",
    "in fact , for @xmath133 , we deduce that the different pair satisfies @xmath199 so that they are biorthogonal , while they are in general not for @xmath200 : @xmath201 for @xmath200 .",
    "these results are of course related to the reality of the eigenvalues of @xmath135 and @xmath156 .",
    "in fact , when @xmath132 , the eigenvalues @xmath202 are all real , and we know for general reasons that @xmath158 must be orthogonal to @xmath203 , but not , in general , to @xmath174 . on the other hand , when the eigenvalues are purely imaginary , @xmath158 are necessarily orthogonal to @xmath174 , but not to @xmath203 .",
    "this has consequences on the possibility of introducing a metric , at least in the way which is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for instance ; see [ appa ] . here",
    ", in fact , the intertwining operator between @xmath135 and @xmath156 has the formal expression @xmath204 ( we recall that @xmath205 ) . however this operator acts in different ways depending on whether we are in the @xmath0-symmetric or @xmath0-broken region .",
    "for instance , for @xmath200 ( @xmath0-symmetric region ) , @xmath206 is proportional to @xmath207 .",
    "however , for @xmath133 ( @xmath0-broken region ) , we can find that @xmath206 is proportional to @xmath208 .",
    "therefore , except for some multiplicative coefficients which can be fixed properly , @xmath209 can change eigenstates @xmath210 of @xmath156 either into the eigenstates @xmath207 or into the eigenstates @xmath208 of @xmath135 , depending on the parameter region .",
    "of course , a similar behavior is expected for an operator @xmath211 defined in analogy with @xmath209 .",
    "an interesting issue to consider now is the completeness of the sets @xmath183 and @xmath184 . in many applications in quantum mechanics with non - hermitian hamiltonians",
    "the eigenvectors of a given @xmath12 and @xmath212 are , in fact , non - orthogonal but complete in their hilbert space . what may or may not be true is that they are also bases for such a hilbert space  @xcite .",
    "hence , it is surely worth to investigate this kind of properties for @xmath183 and @xmath184 . in the present case ,",
    "we obtain the following interesting result :    if @xmath3 is such that @xmath213 is not a natural number , then @xmath183 and @xmath184 are complete in @xmath108 . if , on the other hand , @xmath213 is a positive integer number @xmath214 , then @xmath183 and @xmath184 are not complete .",
    "let @xmath215 be a vector which is orthogonal to all the eigenvectors @xmath158 .",
    "we would like to show if and in which condition @xmath216 is zero .",
    "first of all , since @xmath217 in particular , it follows that @xmath218 for all @xmath219 .",
    "moreover , we also have , for @xmath121 and for all @xmath61 , @xmath220 then , by subtraction , we have @xmath221 but , since @xmath222 , it follows that , if @xmath213 is not equal to any natural numbers , then @xmath223 for all @xmath61 and for all @xmath121 .",
    "then , because of the completeness of the set @xmath224 , we conclude that @xmath225 .",
    "this result , together with ( [ 310 ] ) , now implies that @xmath226 for all @xmath61 and for @xmath121 .",
    "since we also have that @xmath218 , however , it follows that @xmath227 after using again the completeness of @xmath224 . hence @xmath228 .",
    "let us now check what happens if @xmath229 , for some particular natural number @xmath214 . in this case",
    "we find that @xmath230 for all @xmath61 , and therefore @xmath231 we see that we are _ losing one vector _ , so that it is not really surprising that the set @xmath183 ceases to be complete .",
    "in fact , a simple computation shows that , for instance , the non - zero vector @xmath232 is orthogonal to all the eigenvectors @xmath158 as well as to @xmath233 for all fixed @xmath219 .",
    "a similar proof can be repeated for the set @xmath184 .",
    "* remarks : * ( i ) the content of this proposition can be understood in terms of exceptional points : we have an exceptional point when @xmath229 , for a natural number @xmath214 , while no exceptional point exists if @xmath213 is not natural .",
    "it is exactly the presence of an exceptional point which makes two eigenvectors collapse into a single one , and this prevent @xmath183 to be a basis .",
    "\\(ii ) the above result implies that in order for @xmath183 or @xmath184 to be bases for @xmath108 , @xmath3 must be such that its square is not a natural number , since any basis must be , first of all , complete and , in this situation , our sets are not . on the other hand ,",
    "whenever @xmath213 is not an integer , @xmath183 or @xmath184 could be bases , but the question is , for the time being , still open .",
    "we believe that , even if this is often not so for non - hermitian hamiltonians  @xcite , it is probably true in the present situation .",
    "it is now interesting to observe that the results that we have deduced so far can be easily adapted to the other dirac cone at @xmath2 .",
    "this is because the hamiltonian @xmath234 in this case is simply the transpose of @xmath135 in eq .",
    "( [ 31 ] ) .",
    "hence we have @xmath235 if we now compare the generic eigenvalue equations for @xmath236 and @xmath234 , @xmath237 it is easy to see that the second equation is mapped into the first one if we put @xmath238 , @xmath239 and @xmath240 .",
    "hence the conclusion is that the eigenvectors of @xmath234 are just those which we have deduced previously after this changes , and that the eigenvalues are just those of @xmath236 but with signs exchanged .",
    "more in details we find that , for all @xmath219 and @xmath121 , @xmath241 where @xmath242 and @xmath243    when @xmath50 we have @xmath244 where @xmath245 , and @xmath246 combining @xmath247 for @xmath234 with @xmath136 for @xmath236 ( see below eq .  ) , we see that these two eigenvalues become complex as in fig .",
    "[ fig - exceptional point ] but without the horizontal arrows .    notice that , similarly to what happened for @xmath236 , the hamiltonian @xmath234 has no ( non - zero ) eigenstate corresponding to @xmath248 .",
    "similar features as those considered for @xmath236 arise also here , as for instance the completeness of the sets of eigenstates of @xmath234 and of its adjoint , and the conclusions do not differ from what we have found so far ; we will not repeat similar considerations here .",
    "in this paper we have considered an extended non - hermitian version of the graphene hamiltonian close to the dirac points @xmath1 and @xmath2 . on a mathematical side",
    "we have shown that , depending on the value of the parameter @xmath3 measuring this non - hermiticity , exceptional points may arise , which breaks down the existence of a basis for @xmath108 .",
    "in fact , the set of eigenstates of @xmath236 is not even complete at the exceptional points .",
    "we have also deduced an interesting behavior concerning the zeroth eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the model : while @xmath162 does exist , no @xmath166 can be found in @xmath108 , at least if @xmath249 .",
    "similarly , @xmath250 does exist , but @xmath165 does not .",
    "hence , introducing @xmath3 in the hamiltonian creates a sort of asymmetry between the plus and the minus eigenstates , at least for the ground state .",
    "this asymmetry disappears as soon as @xmath3 is sent to zero .",
    "if we compare the conclusion for the @xmath0-symmetric graphene with the physical view of the simplest case that we described in introduction , we may say the following .",
    "the electrons doped on one sublattice may not be carried to the other sublattice through the central channels @xmath50 as soon as we introduce the @xmath0-symmetric chemical potential .",
    "the other channels remain open until @xmath251 , when the corresponding @xmath58th channel is closed .",
    "it may be an interesting future work to drive the system around an exceptional point to see the state swapping  @xcite .",

    "we here briefly describe the general notion of the intertwining operator that we have introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec3.1 ] . in order to avoid mathematical problems , we focus here on finite - dimensional hilbert spaces . in this way",
    "our operators are finite matrices .",
    "the main ingredient is an operator ( i.e.  a matrix ) @xmath12 , acting on the vector space @xmath252 , with @xmath253 and with exactly @xmath254 distinct eigenvalues @xmath20 , @xmath255 , where the hermitian conjugate @xmath256 of @xmath12 is the usual one , i.e.  the complex conjugate of the transpose of the matrix @xmath12 . because of what follows , and in order to fix the ideas , it is useful to remind here that the hermitian conjugate @xmath257 of an operator @xmath258 is defined in terms of the _ natural _ scalar product @xmath259 of the hilbert space @xmath260 : @xmath261 , for all @xmath262 , where @xmath263 , with obvious notation .    in this appendix",
    "we will restrict to the case in which all the eigenvalues @xmath20 are real , and with multiplicity one .",
    "hence @xmath264 the set @xmath265 is a basis for @xmath252 , since the eigenvalues are all different .",
    "then an unique biorthogonal basis of @xmath78 , @xmath266 , surely exists  @xcite : @xmath267 , for all @xmath268 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath269 is automatically an eigenstate of @xmath256 , with eigenvalue @xmath270 : @xmath271 using the bra - ket notation we can write @xmath272 , where , for all @xmath273 , we define @xmath274 .    we now introduce the ` intertwining ' operators @xmath275 and @xmath276 , following ref .",
    "these are bounded positive , hermitian , invertible operators , one the inverse of the other : @xmath277 .",
    "moreover @xmath278 and we also get the following intertwining relations involving @xmath12 , @xmath256 , @xmath279 and @xmath211 : @xmath280 notice that the second equality follows from the first one , by left and right multiplying @xmath281 with @xmath279 . to prove the first equality , we first observe that @xmath282 for all @xmath283 .",
    "hence our claim follows because of the basis nature of @xmath284 .",
    "* remark : * it might be interesting to recall that the intertwining operators , such as @xmath279 and @xmath211 , are quite useful in quantum mechanics , @xmath0-symmetric or not @xcite , in order to deduce eigenvectors of certain hamiltonians connected by intertwining relations . for instance ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath285 is an eigenstate of a certain operator @xmath286 with eigenvalue @xmath20 : @xmath287 , and let us also assume that two other operators @xmath288 and @xmath258 exist such that @xmath289 and that the intertwining relation @xmath290 is satisfied .",
    "this is exactly what happens in ( [ a4 ] ) , identifying @xmath258 with @xmath211 , @xmath286 with @xmath12 and @xmath288 with @xmath256 .",
    "then , it is a trivial exercise to check that the non - zero vector @xmath291 is an eigenstate of @xmath288 , with eigenvalue @xmath20 .",
    "indeed we have @xmath292 note that the fact that @xmath286 and @xmath288 are hermitian or not and the fact that @xmath20 is real or not play no role .",
    "note also that the fact that @xmath293 can be deduced out of @xmath285 simply by applying @xmath258 , is exactly what happens in our situation ; see eq .",
    "( [ a3 ] ) .",
    "this explains why the intertwining operators are so important in concrete applications ; they can be used , for instance , to find eigenstates of new operators starting from eigenstates of old ones .",
    "* remark : * it is probably worth mentioning that not all we have discussed here can be easily extended if @xmath294 . for instance , considering the intertwining relations in ( [ a4 ] ) , if , for instance , @xmath12 and @xmath279 are unbounded , taken @xmath295 , the domain of @xmath279 , there is no reason _ a priori _ for @xmath296 to belong to @xmath297 , so that @xmath298 needs not to be defined .",
    "in this appendix we will briefly discuss the role of the @xmath11 and @xmath9 symmetries in our model .",
    "the @xmath11 operator works as follows : @xmath299 note that , as expected for physical reasons , the time - reversal operator flips the magnetic field too .",
    "we therefore have @xmath300 when we apply @xmath11 to @xmath301 we have @xmath302    we thus realize that the time reversal of the dirac cone at @xmath1 is the negative of the dirac cone at @xmath2 . for @xmath62 , we can flip the sign by the diagonal unitary transformation @xmath303 as in @xmath304 .",
    "similarly we have @xmath305 .",
    "note that @xmath91 and @xmath92 are different expressions of the same hamiltonian  , expressions which depend on the direction of the magnetic field along @xmath63 .",
    "the model for @xmath62 is time - reversal symmetric in this sense . under @xmath11 , the dirac cone at @xmath1",
    "is transformed to the one at @xmath2 , which in turn is transformed to the one at @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the set of the two dirac cones for @xmath62 has the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the time - reversal symmetry is broken when @xmath129 because @xmath306 .",
    "this is also true for the parity operation @xmath307 for which we have @xmath308 for @xmath62 , this is isomorphic to @xmath97 but for @xmath129 , @xmath309 is isomorphic to @xmath310 , which is not equal to @xmath311 .",
