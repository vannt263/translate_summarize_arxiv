    "in the last decade the study of the neutrinos properties has seen an increasing interest in both the fields of particle physics and astrophysics .",

    "the following studies in this field allowed to fix a lower limit on the sum of the three neutrino masses of @xmath2@xmath14 ev@xmath15 ev . ] .    from the astrophysical point of view",
    ", the existence of massive neutrinos influences the evolution of the large - scale structure ( lss ) formation via gravitational interaction , thus requiring a generalization of the standard @xmath16 cold dark matter ( @xmath16cdm ) cosmological model to account for @xmath2  as an additional free parameter , leading to a @xmath16cdm@xmath17  scenario .",
    "the effect of this new component is twofold . on early times",
    "it contributes to the universe energy budget as radiation , with density of @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the photon energy density , and @xmath20 is the effective number of neutrino species ( @xmath21 , according to the sm ) .",
    "this causes a postponing of the matter  radiation equality for a fixed value of @xmath22@xmath23 ( where @xmath22  is the ratio between the total matter density of the universe and the critical one , @xmath24 , at the present epoch and @xmath25 is the hubble constant @xmath26 in units of 100 km s@xmath27mpc@xmath27 ) . at late times",
    "the neutrinos large thermal velocities prevent their clustering on scales smaller than their free - streaming length @xmath28 this induces a gravitational backreaction that suppresses density fluctuations of both baryons and cdm on the same scales .",
    "thus , as a net effect massive neutrinos cause a suppression in the amplitude of the matter power spectrum on small scales with respect to an equivalent massless neutrinos model .",
    "the dependence of these effects on the total neutrino mass indicates that astrophysical observations have the potential to provide constraints on the value of @xmath2 , as it has been shown by several recent theoretical works ( see e.  g. * ? ? ?",

    "in fact , the list of cosmological probes that can be used to place limits on the sum of neutrino masses is nowadays long and heterogeneous , including galaxy redshift surveys @xcite , galaxy clustering @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ and _ planck _",
    "@xcite , ly-@xmath29 forest studies @xcite , galaxy clusters mass function @xcite and future 21 cm intensity mapping observations @xcite .",
    "most notably , the current tightest constraints on the sum of the neutrino masses have been derived by @xcite who combined data from the cmb with bao and ly-@xmath29 forest and obtained an upper limit ( 95 per cent c.  l. ) of @xmath2@xmath30 ev",
    ". it should be noted , however , that all these bounds have been derived assuming that massive neutrinos evolve in an otherwise standard @xmath16cdm  cosmological model .",
    "possible alternative scenarios such as non - standard dark energy or modified gravity theories may result in significantly looser constraints ( see e.  g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "* ) effect : the joint analysis of these datasets and bao data led to an estimate of @xmath2@xmath31 ev @xcite .",
    "however this result is hampered by the degeneracy with the other cosmological parameters ( mainly @xmath32  and @xmath22 ) and by the uncertainty in the amount of non - thermal pressure contribution in galaxy clusters .",
    "indeed , more recently the analysis of the latest _ planck",
    "_  data release @xcite showed that the attempt to reconcile primary cmb and cluster counts by increasing @xmath2  only leads to a conflict with @xmath26 measurements from bao .",
    "this indicates that the origin of this tension is not fully understood and that additional efforts involving other observational probes are necessary",
    ".    in this framework new potentially interesting observational constraints may come from the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich ( ksz ) effect , i.  e. a secondary anisotropy of the cmb caused by the motion of free electrons of the lss , whose dependence on the physical properties of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is complementary in many aspects with respect to the tsz one ( see e.  g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the ksz effect is expected to be sensitive to the igm residing in non - collapsed structures at high redshift .",
    "while several new generation microwave telescopes have reached the sensitivity to achieve the first ksz effect detections on galaxy clusters @xcite , up to now the only measurement of its power spectrum has been obtained with the south pole telescope ( spt ) by @xcite and by @xcite . by combining the tsz bispectrum from the spt - sz survey ( 800 deg@xmath6 ) with the full 2540 deg@xmath6  field they measured an amplitude of the ksz temperature fluctuations of @xmath3@xmath7 @xmath5k@xmath6  at @xmath33 .",
    "this places the first interesting constraint on a quantity that is expected to receive contribution from the lss of the ionized universe and from the epoch of reionization ( eor ) itself . while the latter is extremely uncertain and depends on subtle details of the reionization process ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , the ksz effect of the post - ionization era can be studied with suitable lss simulations and depends mostly on the cosmological assumptions .",
    "this gives the ksz effect the potential to provide constraints on several cosmological parameters , including @xmath2 .",
    "this paper is the first of a series of studies of the ksz effect from the lss of the universe in different cosmological scenarios beyond the standard @xmath16cdm  paradigm . in this work we present the first analysis of the ksz effect derived from a set of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that include a detailed treatment of the massive neutrino component @xcite .",
    "our simulations follow the evolution of structure formation from large scales ( @xmath34@xmath35  mpc ) down to the non - linear regime spanning all the relevant redshifts . by analysing the outputs of the baryonic component , adopting a minimum number of assumptions ,",
    "we derive a set of doppler @xmath36-parameter  maps and compute the corresponding power spectrum of ksz - induced cmb temperature fluctuations in the multipole range of @xmath37 .",
    "this allows us to make a direct comparison with the spt measurement and to derive how our results depend on the value of the redshift of reionization , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",

    "we describe the simulation set used in this work , our procedure to create mock light - cones and our ksz effect model . in section  [",
    "s : res ] we present our results in terms of the effect of neutrino mass on the global properties of the ksz effect and discuss the dependence with @xmath1 .",
    "section  [ s : sys ] is devoted to the study of possible systematics caused by limited box size , finite resolution and accuracy of the astrophysical processes of our simulations .",
    "we summarize and draw our conclusions in section  [ s : concl ] .",
    "we have run hydrodynamical simulations using the treepm+sph code gadget - iii   @xcite for four different cosmologies with massless and massive neutrinos .",
    "the value of the following cosmological parameters are common to all models : @xmath22@xmath38@xmath39@xmath40@xmath41@xmath40@xmath42@xmath43 , @xmath41@xmath44 , @xmath45@xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ( corresponding to @xmath32@xmath50 at @xmath51 in the @xmath16cdm  scenario ) , in agreement with the latest results by @xcite . in models with massive neutrinos we set @xmath42@xmath52@xmath2@xmath53 and modified the value of @xmath39  accordingly to keep @xmath22  constant . in our fiducial",
    "runs we follow the evolution of @xmath54 cdm plus @xmath54 gas plus @xmath54 neutrino particles ( only in models with massive neutrinos ) .",
    "a summary of the simulation parameters is shown in table  [ t : sim ] .    [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     these results can be compared with the ones by @xcite , obtained with a completely different approach but similar cosmological parameters : they obtain a steeper dependence for both their non - radiative ( nr ) model , with values of 0.30.4 , and cooling star formation ( csf ) , with values of 0.40.6 . this difference with respect to their nr model appears to be connected to the treatment of low redshift gas : in fact , their cumulative contribution of the ksz effect ( see their fig .  6 ) shows a fraction of about 50 per cent of ksz effect associated with the redshift range @xmath55 of , compared to our 61 per cent .",
    "this indicates that their method is underestimating the contribution in the non - linear regime ( for a detailed explanation , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus reducing the ksz at low redshift and steepening their relation at higher @xmath56 . in their csf",
    "run this effect adds to the overcooling problem present in their simulation that they do not correct ( see , instead , our correction with equation  [ e : rhoc ] ) .",
    "this causes a further reduction of the low redshift contribution .",
    "the dependence on neutrino mass shows an opposite trend as a function of the multipole , increasing from @xmath57 at @xmath33 to @xmath58 at @xmath59 .",
    "this is similar to the expected behaviour of the dependence with @xmath32   ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that even with a measurement of @xmath60  at different multipoles it is difficult to break the @xmath2@xmath32  degeneracy .",
    "however it is interesting to point out that the dependence with @xmath11  of the tsz power spectrum is significantly different : @xcite found that its normalization scales as @xmath61@xmath62 , so approximately with a double steepness with respect to the ksz equivalent at @xmath33 .",
    "on the other hand , it is known that the dependence of the two power spectra with @xmath32  shows less differences : in fact , the ksz effect scales as @xmath60@xmath12@xmath32@xmath63 , while the tsz effect only slightly steeper , with @xmath61@xmath12@xmath32@xmath64 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a combined tsz - ksz observation can help break the degeneracy between the effect of massive neutrinos and @xmath32 .",
    "this point can be understood considering that , unlike the ksz , the tsz effect is dominated by small - scale perturbations of the igm ( i.  e. galaxy clusters and groups ) . at large wave numbers",
    "the suppression of the amplitude of the matter power spectrum induced by neutrinos is almost scale - independent , therefore , at that regime , the effects of massive neutrinos and variations of @xmath32   are degenerate , and observables that are sensitive to these scales will exhibit that behaviour . a standard way to break this type of degeneracy",
    "consists in combining observables on small scales , such as the halo mass function of the ly-@xmath29 forest , with the ones more sensitive to large scales like cmb , bao or , as discussed here , ksz effect power spectrum .",
    "one of the main challenges in modelling the ksz effect properties with simulations is the necessity of runs with both large volumes and high resolution : in fact , the ksz effect is the result of the coupling between the large - scale velocity modes and the small - scale non - linear gas motions . in this section",
    "we will use our second simulation set to investigate the possible systematics in our modelling of the ksz power spectrum due to finite resolution and limited box size .",
    "in addition , we will use our csfw run to assess the reliability of our physical treatment of the igm in describing the ksz properties .    the plot in fig .",
    "[ f : pows_syst ] shows the ksz effect power spectrum as a function of the multipole @xmath65 assuming @xmath1@xmath66 and massless neutrinos but varying simulation parameters .",
    "since the n0 and hr simulations differ only for the mass resolution , a comparison between the two isolates the dependence on this parameter .",
    "the two power spectra are almost identical at low @xmath65 , while the amplitude of the hr simulation is lower by about 5 per cent for @xmath67 .",
    "this small difference is due to the star fraction correction , described by equation  ( [ e : rhoc ] ) : since the hr simulation predicts a significantly higher star formation ( see fig .",
    "[ f : fstar ] ) and since we apply the same correction on all the particles belonging to the same redshift and not in the exact position where star particles are formed , this perfectly accounts for the missing power of the hr simulation at large scales , but fails to recover the full signal at small ones .",
    "the fact that despite the extreme value of @xmath68@xmath69 predicted by the hr model we are able to get almost the same result as for the n0 power spectrum , indicates that for more realistic star formation histories , like the ones of our first simulation set , our method is able to mimic the star - formation history of @xcite without introducing significant systematics due to the lack of spatial information .",
    "this is partially confirmed by the analysis of the csfw power spectrum , which shows a slightly higher amplitude with respect to the n0 one ( less than 5 per cent for @xmath70 ) .",
    "however at higher multipoles the igm feedback starts to play a non - negligible role , with galactic winds that increase the difference up to 10 per cent at @xmath71 ( see also the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "but for the second simulation set , i.  e. assuming massless neutrinos with varying simulation parameters and physics .",
    "the solid line shows the average obtained from our reference model , n0 , with the grey - shaded area that encloses the central 34 light - cones ( 68 per cent of the total ) . the dashed , dot - dashed , dot - dot - dot - dashed and dotted lines correspond to the average of the hr , sb , lb and csfw simulations , respectively ( see details in table  [ t : sim ] ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we test the impact of limited volume by using the results of the other two simulations , sb and lb , and comparing them with an analytical prediction .",
    "@xcite defined a method to estimate the amount of missing velocity power based on the linear theory : we refer the reader to their work for the details of the procedure , and summarize the final result . when the power spectrum of the velocity field , @xmath72 , is known it is possible to calculate its rms in the following way @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the wave number .",
    "since @xmath72 decreases rapidly at small scales , the result depends on the value of @xmath75 that can be adjusted according to the sampled volume .",
    "therefore we can compute the density power spectrum @xmath76 in the linear - theory approximation using camb with our reference @xmath16cdm  cosmology . ] , then derive @xmath72 using the mass conservation equation and compute the value of @xmath77 as a function of the simulation box size .",
    "[ f : linpow ] shows the fraction of total linear - theory velocity power as a function of @xmath78 .     for details ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    this method predicts that our n0 simulation misses the 25 per cent of the total linear velocity power , while about half and 10 per cent should be missed by the sb and lb runs , respectively .",
    "obviously the linear prediction serves only as an indication of possible biases since at the angular scales of interest for this work the ksz effect receives a significant contribution from the low - redshift universe ( see fig .  [",
    "f : zre ] ) , thus also by gas already in the non - linear regime whose dynamics should be well described by our hydrodynamical simulations . analysing the results of fig .",
    "[ f : pows_syst ] , we do observe a significant damping for the sb with respect to the n0 run : about 20 per cent at large @xmath65 , with respect to about 30 per cent predicted by the linear theory .",
    "most interestingly , the value of @xmath3  for the lb model is 3.73 @xmath5k@xmath6 , so the n0 result of 3.21 @xmath5k@xmath6  is lower by 14 per cent , with respect to almost 20 per cent predicted by the linear theory .",
    "this indicates that although our 240@xmath35  mpc box is lacking part of the large - scale velocity power , the linear theory approximation slightly overestimates this amount . with the data that we have it is difficult to provide a precise value of the amount of ksz signal that is missing due to the limited box size , and its dependence on the angular scale",
    "however , given what said above , we estimate it to be about 20 per cent and add the volume corrected values of @xmath60  in the third column of table  [ t : fit ] .    when accounting for this correction , we point out that our prediction on the ksz power spectrum at @xmath33 for the @xmath16cdm  model becomes @xmath3@xmath4 @xmath5k@xmath6 , thus significantly higher with respect to what obtained by several previous works , such as @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , even if we are assuming a lower value of @xmath1@xmath66 instead of the more popular @xmath1@xmath79 . again",
    ", this is associated with the fact that previous simulations did not correct for the overcooling problem , hence overestimating the amount of star formation that , instead , we calibrate on observational data . on the other hand ,",
    "the estimate of @xcite is likely subject to an underestimate of the ksz signal at low redshift ( see the discussion in section  [ ss : pows ] ) .",
    "an important consequence is that when applying this correction our constraints on patchy reionization become significantly tighter with respect to previous estimates . in detail , combining our result with the spt measurement of @xmath3@xmath7 @xmath5k@xmath6  @xcite , we obtain an upper limit of @xmath8@xmath9 @xmath5k@xmath6  ( 95 per cent c.  l. ) .",
    "in this paper we have analysed a set of four cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study how massive neutrinos influence the properties of the ksz effect due to the igm after reionization .",
    "our runs have been carried out with the treepm+sph code gadget - iii , following the evolution of three different particle types : gas , cdm and massive neutrinos in a box of 240@xmath35  mpc per side .",
    "starting from their outputs at different redshifts we have produced 50 light - cone realizations from which we computed a set of doppler @xmath36-parameter  maps for each model , and relative ksz power spectrum keeping track of the information in 20 redshift bins in the interval @xmath80 . since our simulations followed star formation with a simplified model we corrected their output value of @xmath68@xmath69 in order to match the current observational results ( ultravista data by * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , we have done the same analysis on a set of four simulations with massless neutrinos but varying the resolution , box size and physical prescription , to study possible systematic effects .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "in agreement with previous findings @xcite , the typical values of the relative temperature variations are of the order of @xmath81 , with peaks of @xmath82 .",
    "for all models the distribution of temperature fluctuations is well represented by a gaussian curve , whose dispersion decreases with increasing neutrino mass as @xmath83 .",
    "2 .   the ksz effect at large scales can be described with good precision ( about 5 per cent at @xmath70 ) adopting simulations with simple physical prescription , by applying a correction that accounts for the uncertainty in the star mass fraction .",
    "3 .   using the second simulation set we verified how our results depend on the limited box size , and verified that the linear - theory approximation slightly overestimates the amount of missing velocity power .",
    "given our box size of 240@xmath35  mpc per side we estimate that we are missing about 20 per cent of the total ksz power spectrum , instead of the 25 per cent predicted by the linear theory .",
    "4 .   in our @xmath16cdm  model",
    "we obtain a value of @xmath3@xmath84 @xmath5k@xmath6 , which becomes @xmath3@xmath4 @xmath5k@xmath6  if we add the expected missing velocity power , enough to account for all of the spt measurement of @xmath3@xmath7 @xmath5k@xmath6  @xcite",
    ". with currently favoured cosmological parameters , this points towards a rapid reionization scenario and translates into a stringent upper limit to the possible ksz effect contribution from patchy reionization models of @xmath8@xmath9 @xmath5k@xmath6  ( 95 per cent c.  l. ) .",
    "massive neutrinos induce a reduction of the ksz power spectrum at all angular scales of about 8 , 12 and 40 per cent for @xmath10 ev , respectively .",
    "all models agree within 1@xmath85 with the spt measurement indicating that current ksz data alone can not provide interesting constraints on @xmath2 .",
    "we studied how the value of the ksz power spectrum scales with @xmath1  and @xmath2   ( see table  [ t : fit ] ) . at @xmath33 , with out fiducial values , we obtain @xmath3@xmath12@xmath1@xmath13 . we observe that the dependence on @xmath86 is significantly shallower with respect to the tsz equivalent , that is expected to scale as @xmath61@xmath87 @xcite . since the scaling of the two quantities with @xmath32  is more similar ( @xmath32@xmath63 and @xmath32@xmath64 for the ksz and tsz effect , respectively ) , this suggests that a combined measurement of the two power spectra may represent an additional way to break the @xmath2@xmath32  degeneracy .    despite the relatively large error bars of the first ksz power spectrum measurement @xcite , our results show that this type of observable is extremely promising in providing information on the history of lss formation .",
    "in fact , we have shown that with current @xmath16cdm  cosmology the ksz due to post",
    "ionization already exceeds the nominal value and is close to the @xmath88 limit , providing interesting constraints on several astrophysical and cosmological models . indeed ,",
    "besides patchy reionization , several non - standard cosmologies , like quintessence @xcite , modified gravity ( see e.  g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and coupled dark energy @xcite , generically predict an excess of velocity power spectrum with respect to standard @xmath16cdm   @xcite . on the other hand the presence of massive neutrinos , which represent a necessary ingredient for any realistic cosmological model , results in a reduction of the ksz effect and",
    "must be taken into account before rejecting any of the mentioned model based on their predicted excess in the ksz signal .    in this framework",
    "further theoretical analyses are required , in particular simulations of larger cosmological volumes to account for the full velocity power spectrum and a more extended sampling of the parameter space for both standard ( as e.  g. @xmath22  and @xmath32 ) and non - standard ( as e.  g. dark energy and modified gravity ) cosmological parameters aimed at studying possible intrinsic degeneracies .",
    "these detailed models , that we plan for our future works , will be necessary in the perspective to interpret current and possible future ksz effect observations by e.  g. _ planck _ alma , act and actpol or the future generation of microwave telescopes .",
