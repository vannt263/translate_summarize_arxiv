    "as commonly concerned in continuous phase transitions , critical exponents and university class play an extremely important role in the study of qcd phase transitions .",
    "different systems with the same symmetry and dimension should share identical critical exponents and belong to the same universality class , indicating that the collective properties near a continuous phase transition are independent of the dynamical details of the system . the frg encodes thermal and quantum fluctuations from ultraviolet to infrared through coarse graining and scale transformation , giving reliable physical predictions in the vicinity of continuous phase transitions .",

    "for instance , the elemental constituents of a qcd system undergo a change from hadrons at low temperature to quarks and gluons at high temperature , and this change leads to the deconfinement phase transition . on the other hand , the system goes through a continuous change in the dimension when the temperature increases .",

    "in fact , the exact solution to the gaussian model in space with dimension @xmath9 gives indeed the same result as the mean field method , despite of the difference in understanding the physics .",
    "this motivates the expansion in @xmath10  @xcite , under the assumption that the critical exponents and physical parameters are continuous with the change in dimension .",
