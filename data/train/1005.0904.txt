    "the dissipation quantum dynamics of optical cavities has been well investigated and deeply understood under the born - markov ( bm ) approximation @xcite .",
    "the bm approximation is valid when the coupling between the system and the environment is weak enough so that the perturbation is applied , and meantime the characteristic time of the environment is sufficiently shorter than that of the system so that the non - markovian memory effect is negligible .",
    "however , in many situations in the recent development of optical microcavities , the strong coupling effect or the long - time memory effect has become an important factor in controlling cavity dynamics .",
    "typical examples include optical fields propagating in cavity arrays or in an optical fiber @xcite , trapped ions subjected to artificial colored noise @xcite , and microcavities interacting with a coupled resonator optical waveguide ( crow ) or photonic crystals @xcite , etc .",
    "specifically , for the trapped ions coupled with an engineered reservoir , the change of the characteristic frequency of the reservoir can be accomplished simply by applying a random electric field through a band - pass filter defining the frequency spectrum of the reservoir @xcite . while , for a cavity interacting with crow or photonic crystals , the coupling between them is controllable by changing the geometrical parameters of the defect cavity and the distance between the cavity and the crow @xcite .",
    "both of them provide non - markovian dissipation and decoherence channels @xcite .",
    "these strong coupling or long - time memory effects result in a complicated non - markovian process in cavity systems that has become a crucial concern for the rapid development of quantum information and quantum computation in terms of photons @xcite .",
    "the non - markovian behavior of the trapped ions has been discussed in many works @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall investigate the non - markovian dynamics for the second case , the cavity strongly coupled with its environment ( crow or photonic crystals ) .",
    "quantum dynamics of cavity systems is completely described by the master equation of the reduced density operator by taking the cavity as an open system .",
    "the master equation under the bm approximation can be found in many textbooks @xcite .",
    "however , an exact master equation beyond the bm approximation is only derived in a few works .",
    "the first exact master equation , also called as hu - paz - zhang master equation for quantum brownian motion , was found almost two decades ago @xcite , in terms of wigner distribution function in phase space via feynman - vernon influence functional @xcite .",
    "recently , our group developed exact master equations of the reduced density operator for both the fermion systems @xcite and the bosonic systems @xcite , by using an extended feynman - vernon influence functional .",
    "these exact master equations can fully depict the quantum dissipative and decoherence dynamics in various open systems in the strong coupling regime .",
    "for the cavity system , the master equation obtained in @xcite is for zero - temperature .",
    "here we shall extend it to a finite temperature . in practical , the temperature effect is also unavoidable and non - negligible .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that for cavity frequency lies in the microwave regime , thermal photons are presented even at liquid helium temperatures @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall use the exact master equation which is valid at arbitrary temperature to investigate the exact non - markovian dynamics of a general cavity strongly coupled with its reservoir , and to find general features of the coupling and temperature dependence in non - markovian dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the exact master equation we developed recently for the reduced density operator of the cavity system coupled to a general reservoir , from which the second - order perturbation master equation and the bm maser equation are reproduced at well - defined limits . in sec .",
    "iii , we then solve analytically the exact master equation via the coherent - state representation , included the exact solutions of mean field amplitude and the average photon number inside the cavity that experimentally measurable .",
    "we also obtain explicitly the reduced density matrix for three different initial states : the vacuum state , the coherent state and the mixed state , to show the different non - markovian behaviors .",
    "the decoherence dynamics of cavity field is explicitly analyzed . in sec .",
    "iv , we numerically demonstrate the exact non - markovian behavior through the time - dependence of the mean mode amplitude and the average photon number in the cavity in both the weak and strong coupling regimes for three typical spectral densities , the ohmic , sub - ohmic and super - ohmic cases , with the cavity s frequency being focused in the microwave regime .",
    "we find that the strong coupling between the cavity and the reservoir results in a long - time dissipationless evolution to the cavity field amplitude , and the noise dynamics undergoes a critical transition from the weak to strong coupling due to the non - markovian memory effect .",
    "finally a conclusion is given in sec .",
    "we consider a cavity with a single mode coupled to a general reservoir .",
    "the hamiltonian of the total system is given by @xmath0 in which the first term is for the single cavity mode with @xmath1 being the creation and annihilation operators of the cavity field , @xmath2 is its frequency ; the second term is the hamiltonian @xmath3 for a general reservoir modeled as a collection of infinite harmonic oscillators , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the corresponding creation and annihilation operators of the @xmath6th oscillator with the frequency @xmath7 .",
    "the coupling between the cavity and the environment is described by the third term and @xmath8 is the coupling strength between them , which is tunable for the reservoir being crow or photonic crystals @xcite .      the exact master equation for the cavity field is given in terms of the reduced density operator which is defined from the density operator of the total system by tracing over entirely the environmental degrees of freedom : @xmath9 , where the total density operator is governed by the quantum liouville equation @xmath10 .",

    "@xmath146 of the super - ohmic reservoir maintains a largest nonzero steady value in the strong coupling regime because its short - time oscillation occurs in the shortest time within which only the smallest energy is dissipated . while , in the bm limit , @xmath151 keeps in a nonzero constant , namely the cavity is always in a dissipation state",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the super - ohmic reservoir contains the strongest non - markovian memory effect shown in the long - time dissipationless process for the cavity field , while the sub - ohmic reservoir involves the strongest short - time oscillating non - markovian dynamics . in the previous investigations on non - markovian effect ,",
    "one has observed the short - time oscillation behavior in the dissipation processes in the weak coupling regime @xcite .",
    "the long - time dissipationless stationary behavior in the strong coupling regime may only be revealed from a nonperturbation theory , as we shown here .    to see clearly the significance of the temperature effect of the non - markovian memory dynamics ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ vt ] the time evolution of the correlation function @xmath22 in the weak and strong coupling regimes and compare the results with the bm solution again .",
    "the correlation function @xmath22 characterizes the temperature - dependent noise effect ( the average photon correlation through the reservoir ) .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath22 is also the main contribution to the average photon number inside the cavity induced mainly by thermal noise dynamics , see eq .",
    "( [ an ] ) .",
    "it is shown in table [ table ] that , in the zero - temperature limit @xmath152 , @xmath104 . however , at a finite temperature , it will behave very differently for different couplings .        in the very weak coupling limit ( @xmath153 )",
    ", the exact @xmath22 is almost the same as the bm solution , except for the sub - ohmic spectral density in which @xmath22 shows a long - time oscillation , as a weak non - markovian memory effect . with the increasing of @xmath138 , the quantitative difference between the exact solution and its bm limit",
    "is enlarged for all the three spectral densities . comparing the behavior of @xmath22 among different @xmath138 for a given spectral density , we find that , similar to the behavior of @xmath146 , a short - time oscillation ( almost invisible in fig .  [ vt ] ) of @xmath22 exists for all the three spectral densities . in the long - time limit , for different coupling strengths ,",
    "the stationary values of the exact @xmath22 for all three different spectral densities can be very different from the bm result .",
    "the numerical result in fig .",
    "[ vt ] clearly shows that @xmath154 is far away from the bm limit @xmath155 in the strong coupling regime , as we discussed analytically in the last section .",
    "in particular , continuously increasing the coupling strength @xmath138 shows that the sub - ohmic case manifests a significantly qualitative difference from the bm limit .",
    "the time oscillation behavior of @xmath22 for the sub - ohmic case is very strong and maintains for a longer time when the coupling @xmath138 becomes larger .",
    "this long - time oscillation behavior comes actually from the long - time periodical oscillation of @xmath41 , as we shown in fig .",
    "[ subohmic - eta=1 ] .",
    "however , in the strong coupling regime , @xmath22 of the super - ohmic spectral density increases slower than the bm limit with increasing @xmath138 but the overall time evolution is qualitatively the same as in the bm limit . in other words ,",
    "the temperature - induced noise effect becomes very important for sub - ohmic case and then for the ohmic case while it may be minor for the super - ohmic reservoir in the strong coupling regime , which is quite different in comparison with the solution in the weak coupling cases , see fig .",
    "[ vt ] .    to show the totally non - markovian memory effect distributing in the amplitude damping and the noise dynamics",
    ", we examine the average photon number inside the cavity which is analytically given by eq .",
    "( [ an ] ) . from equation ( [ an ] )",
    ", we see that the average photon number contains two terms , the first term is the decay of the initial average photon number determined by the propagating function @xmath41 , and the second term is just the correlation function @xmath22 as a noise effect which sensitively depends on the initial temperature of the reservoir .",
    "the numerical solutions based on the exact solution ( [ an ] ) for three different spectral densities are plotted in fig .",
    "[ nt ] with a comparison to the bm result .    in the weak coupling regime",
    "( roughly @xmath156 , as we see the exact solution of @xmath77 shows a monotonic decay , similar to that in the bm limit .",
    "however , in the strong coupling regime ( roughly @xmath157 , a revival process occurs in the exact @xmath77 , namely the average photon number decays faster in the very beginning and then after a short - time oscillation ( or no oscillation ) , it revives till it reaches to a steady value .",
    "this behavior does not show up in the bm approximation .",
    "in fact , the plots in fig .",
    "[ nt ] show that the time evolution of the average photon number undergoes a critical transition from the weak to strong coupling regimes .",
    "the transition regime here corresponds roughly to @xmath158 .",
    "this critical transition results in a competition between the non - markovian memory effect induced dissipationless phenomena with the thermal noise dynamics in the strong coupling in open systems .",
    "furthermore , this critical transition can still be seen when we reduce the initial temperature of the reservoir to a very low value , see fig .",
    "[ ntlt ] where @xmath159 . the critical transition is clearly shown up for the super - ohmic case .",
    "for the ohmic and sub - ohmic cases , the critical phenomena is not so significant but the average photon number can reach to a very small but nonzero steady value in the strong coupling regime .",
    "this result indicates that the initial temperature of the reservoir may serve as a sensitive control parameter to control the coherence photon number in cavity dynamics in the very low temperature regime , as we have also discussed in the analytical solution presented in the last section .",
    "put all these analysis together , we find that the non - markovian memory effect can qualitatively change the dissipation dynamics of the cavity field in the strong coupling regime , in particular for the super - ohmic reservoir .",
    "meantime , the non - markovian memory effects play an significant role to the thermal noise dynamics , in particular for the sub - ohmic reservoir .",
    "these interesting phenomena worth further investigation in other open systems .",
    "in summary , we have solved analytically the exact master equation , and obtained the general expression for the reduced density operator of the cavity as well as the general solution of the mean model amplitude and the average photon numbers in the cavity .",
    "we take three different initial states : the vacuum state , the coherent state and the mixed state , to show the different non - markovian time evolution of the cavity state .",
    "we find that ( i ) the solution of the exact master equation is very different from the bm approximation due to the non - markovian memory effect . in the exact non - markovian case",
    ", different initial states may result in different evolution states and different steady states . while the bm solution at steady state limit are the same , independent of the initial states .",
    "( ii ) for the exact non - markovian evolution process , temperature effect can play an important role , and it drastically changes the thermal noise dynamics .",
    "( iii ) the decoherence of cavity coherent field arises from both the reservoir - induced damping effect ( energy dissipation ) and the temperature - dependent noise effect .",
    "both of them can be controlled by varying the coupling between the cavity and the reservoir and lowing the temperature of the reservoir , as shown in our exact solution .",
    "these exact analytical cavity dynamics show the extreme importance of the non - markovian effect and are numerically demonstrated .",
    "moreover , the numerical results show that , the non - markovian memory effect qualitatively changes the amplitude damping behavior of the cavity field as well as the thermal noise dynamics from the weak coupling regime to strong coupling regime , which does not occur in the bm limit .",
    "in particular , we show that the non - markovian memory effect leads to a long - time dissipationless process to the cavity field in the strong coupling regime , and meantime it results in a critical transition dynamics when we vary the cavity system from the weak to strong couplings with the reservoir .",
    "further investigations of all these phenomena in other open systems are in progress .",
