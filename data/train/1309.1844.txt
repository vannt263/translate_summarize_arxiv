    "a significant progress on the net present valuation method has been made by real option theory for new investment valuation .",
    "the latter uses recent methods from stochastic finance to price uncertainty and competition in complex investment situations .",
    "real option games are the part of this theory dedicated to the competitive dimension . following the seminal work of smets @xcite , they correspond to an extensively studied situation , where two or more economic agents face with time a common project to invest into , and where there might be an advantage of being a leader ( _ preemptive _ game ) or a follower ( _ attrition _ game ) .",
    "grenadier @xcite , paxson and pinto @xcite or weeds @xcite among many others develop nice examples of this type of model . on these problems and the related literature , azevedo and paxson @xcite or chevalier - roignant _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite provide comprehensive reviews .",
    "real option games are especially dedicated to new investment opportunities following r&d developments , like technological products , a new drug or even real estate projects .",
    "the later investment opportunities indeed add competition risk to the uncertainty of future revenues in the strategic behavior of investors .",
    "the regulatory dimension is also an important part of such investment projects , and the present paper attempts to contribute in this direction",
    ".    the economic situation can be the following .",
    "we consider an investment opportunity on a new market for an homogeneous good , available for two agents labeled one and two .",
    "this investment opportunity is not constrained in time , but the corresponding market is regulated by an outside agent .",
    "both agents have the same model for the project s revenues , and both have also access to a financial market with one risky asset ( a market portfolio ) and a risk - free asset ( a bank account ) .",
    "the situation is a non - cooperative duopoly of preemptive timing game for a single investment oppotunity .",
    "a simple approach to regulation is to consider that when an agent wants to take advantage of such an opportunity , he must satisfy some non - financial criteria which are scrutinized by the regulator . even though a model of regulatory decision is at the heart of this matter , we will take the most simple and naive approach .",
    "we will just assume that the regulator can accept or refuse an agent to proceed into the investment project , and that this decision is taken randomly .",
    "this extremely simple model finds its root in a widespread convenient assumption . in the standard real option game representing a stackelberg duopoly ,",
    "the settlement of leadership and followership is decided via the flipping of an even coin , independent of the model .",
    "the procedure is used for example in weeds @xcite , tsekeros @xcite or paxson and pinto @xcite who all refer to grenadier @xcite for the justification , which appears in a footnote for a real estate investment project :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ a potential rationale for this assumption is that development requires approval from the local government .",
    "approval may depend on who is first in line or arbitrary considerations .",

    "let us take a brief moment to describe one of those economic situations we have in mind .",
    "assume that two economic agents are running for the investment in a project with possibility of simultaneous investment , as in grasselli _",
    "_ @xcite . in practice ,",
    "even if they are accurately described as symmetrical , they would never act at the exact same time , providing that instantaneous action in a continuous time model is just an idealized situation .",
    "instead , they show their intention to invest to a third party ( a regulator , a public institution ) at approximatively the same time .",
    "an answer to a call for tenders is a typical example of such interactions .",
    "then the arbitrator is invoked to judge the validity of these intentions .",
    "for example , he can evaluate which agent is the most suitable to be granted the project as a leader regarding qualitative criteria .",
    "this situation might be illustrated in particular where environmental or health exigences are in line . when simultaneous investment is impossible , the real estate market example of grenadier @xcite can also be cited again bearing in mind that , in addition to safety constraints , an aesthetic or confidence indicator can intervene in the decision of a market regulator .",
    "because these criteria can be numerous , an approach via randomness of the decision is a decent first approximation . in the extremal case ,",
    "the arbitrator can be biaised and show his preference for on agent .",
    "in general , it leads to an asymmetry in the chance to be elected leader and an unhedgeable risk , and perfectly informed agents should take into account this fact into their decision to invest or to defer .",
    "those are some of the situations the introduction of a random regulator can shed some light on .",
    "our model is presented in a very particular way by using a normal form game in an extended natural virtual time , as initially proposed by fudenberg and tirole @xcite , and followed by thijssen and _ al .",
    "_ @xcite or grasselli and _ al .",
    "this model bears a very specific interpretation , but appears to encompass in a continuous manner the cournot competition setting of smets @xcite and the stackelberg competition of grenadier @xcite .",
    "the introduction of a regulator also renders the market incomplete .",
    "we then follow two classical approaches , namely the risk - neutral and the risk - averse cases respectively .",
    "the latter case actually brings up new insights on the strategic interactions of players in the cournot and stackelberg setttings . against the existing literature ,",
    "the present contribution situates itself as a contribution to mathematical clarifications of the standard real option game , with new angles .",
    "let us present how the remaining of the paper proceeds .",
    "section [ sec : game ] introduces the standard model and its extension to the random regulatory framework .",
    "section [ sec : nash ] provides the study of the model and optimal strategies in the general case . in section [ sec : singular ] , we present how the proposed model encompasses the usual types of competition , and propose a new asymmetrical situation related to the stackelberg competition framework .",
    "section [ sec : aversion ] introduces risk - aversion in agents evaluation to study the effect of a random regulator and the uncertain outcome of a coordination game on equilibrium strategies of two opponents .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] finishes on critism and possible extentions .",
    "we assume for the moment that the regulator does not intervene .",
    "the framework is thus the standard one that one shall find for example in grasselli _",
    "notations and results of this section follow from the latter . the later research will then be cited repeatedly in the present article .",
    "we consider a stochastic basis @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the filtration of a one - dimensional brownian motion @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath3 .",

    "it is natural to assume that being alone in the market is better than sharing it with a competitor : @xmath11 but we also assume these quantities to be known and constant .",

    "the variable @xmath20 in [ eq : price ] is the sharpe ratio .",
    "the present financial setting is thus the standard black - scholes - merton model @xcite of a complete perfect financial market .",
    "[ rem : units ] the above setting defines @xmath5 as a random unitary profit and @xmath21 as a fixed quantity , whereas grenadier @xcite and grasselli _ _ et al.__@xcite labelled @xmath5 and @xmath21 as the demand and the inverse demand curve respectively .",
    "this model choice has no incidence in complete market and sections [ sec : follower ] and [ sec : leader ] herefater .",
    "the choice will be discussed in remark [ rem : incomplete ] regarding the introduction of the regulator in section [ sec : regulator ] .      in this setting , since @xmath6 takes known values , the future stream of cash - flows can be evaluated under the risk - neutral measure under which @xmath22 assume that one of the two agents , say agent one , desires to invest at time @xmath8 when @xmath23 . if @xmath24 , then the available market for agent one is @xmath25 .",

    "an additional major change comes into the evaluation of payoffs .",
    "agents information is reduced to @xmath10 .",
    "therefore the final settlement is not evaluable as in the complete market setting , and we shall introduce a pricing criterion .",
    "we follow smets @xcite , grenadier @xcite and many others by making the usual assumption that agents are risk - neutral , i.e. , they evaluate the payoffs by taking the expectation of previously computed values under @xmath80 .",

    "some comments are in order .",
    "first , we shall emphasize that the regulator theoretically intervenes for any situation where @xmath276 .",
    "however , as explained at the beginning of this section , its intervention becomes mostly irrelevant in continuous time when agents do not act simultaneously .",
    "its impact is unavoidable to settle the final payoff after the game , but its influence on agents strategies boils down to the interval @xmath277 $ ] .    at point @xmath278 , there is a strong discontinuity in the optimal behavior of both agents . for @xmath279 , the mixed strategy used by agent two tends toward a pure strategy with systematic investment .",

    "it is also possible to represent the situation of stackelberg leadership advantage .",
    "finally , our setting allows to study a new and weaker type of advantage we call _ weak stackelberg leadership_.      the cournot duopoly refers to a situation when both players adjust quantities simultaneously .",
    "this is the framework of grasseli _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , involving the payoff @xmath87 if agents invest at the same time .",
    "recalling definition [ def : regulator ] , this framework corresponds to @xmath281 we notice that agents then become symmetrical .",

    "the economic situation however loses a part of its meaning .",
    "it would convey the situation where agent two is accepted as investor only if he shares the market with agent one or become a follower . in this setting",

    "<S> we recall the rigorous framework of m. grasselli , v. leclre and m. ludkovsky ( _ priority option : the value of being a leader _ , international journal of theoretical and applied finance , * 16 * , 2013 ) , and extend it to a random regulator . this model generalizes and unifies the different competitive frameworks proposed in the literature , and creates a new one similar to a stackelberg leadership . </S>",
    "<S> we fully characterize strategic interactions in the several situations following from the parametrization of the regulator . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we study the effect of the coordination game and uncertainty of outcome when agents are risk - averse , providing new intuitions for the standard case . </S>"
