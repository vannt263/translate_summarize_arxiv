    "exactly solvable examples played an important role in the understanding of @xmath0 symmetric quantum mechanics and its unusual features .",
    "the first @xmath0 symmetric potentials , i.e. potentials which are invariant under the _ simultaneous _ action of the @xmath2 space- and @xmath3 time reflection operations were found numerically @xcite .",
    "the most surprising result was that these one - dimensional complex potentials possessed _ real _ energy eigenvalues , which however , turned pairwise into complex conjugated pairs as some potential parameter was tuned .",
    "this mechanism was interpreted as the spontaneous breakdown of @xmath0 symmetry , since the potential remained @xmath0 invariant throughout , but the eigenfunctions associated with the discrete spectrum lost this property as the spectrum turned into complex gradually with the tuning of the potential parameter .",
    "further examples have been found in numerical @xcite , semiclassical @xcite and perturbative @xcite studies , but a number of quasi - exactly solvable ( qes ) @xcite and exactly solvable @xcite @xmath0 symmetric potentials have also been identified .",
    "these latter potentials were analogues of hermitian exactly solvable potentials with the property that their real and imaginary components were even and odd functions of the coordinate @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "more recently @xmath0 symmetric problems have been analysed in terms of pseudo - hermiticity @xcite , and their unusual features have been interpreted in terms of this more general context .",
    "a hamiltonian is said to be @xmath5-pseudo - hermitian if there exists a linear , invertible , hermitian operator for which @xmath6 holds .",
    "it has been shown that for systems with hamiltonians of the type @xmath7 @xmath0 symmetry is equivalent with @xmath2-pseudo - hermiticity . with other choices of @xmath5",
    "further complexified hamiltonians can be generated , which might also have real energy eigenvalues but do not fulfill @xmath0 symmetry @xcite .",
    "furthermore , with @xmath8 @xmath5-pseudo - hermiticity reduces to conventional hermiticity .    here",
    "we restrict our analysis to @xmath0 symmetric problems , and in particular , to exactly solvable ones .",
    "a number of peculiar features of @xmath0 symmetric potentials became apparent only during the analysis of these potentials .",
    "* it has been observed that several exactly solvable @xmath0 symmetric potentials possess _ two _ sets of normalisable solutions @xcite in the sense that there can be two normalisable states with the same principal quantum number @xmath9 .",
    "the second set of solutions can appear in several ways . for potentials which are singular at the origin",
    "the problem can be redefined on various trajectories of the complex @xmath4 plane such that the integration path avoids the origin and the solutions remain asymptotically normalisable .",
    "( this latter feature is similar to some numerically solvable @xmath0 symmetric problems @xcite . )",
    "a special case of this scenario is obtained when an _ imaginary _ coordinate shift @xmath1 is employed @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this scenario is that the discussion of the @xmath0 symmetric potential remains rather similar to that of its hermitian counterpart , and by suitable and straightforward modification of the formalism it can also be interpreted as a conventional complex potential defined on the @xmath4 axis .",
    "this imaginary coordinate shift can be employed @xcite to all the shape - invariant @xcite potentials ( e.g. the @xmath0 symmetric harmonic oscillator @xcite or the generalised pschl  teller potential @xcite ) with the exception of the @xmath0 symmetric morse @xcite and coulomb @xcite potentials .",
    "the cancellation of the singularity then regularizes the solution which would be irregular at the origin in the hermitian setting .",
    "a different mechanism appears for potentials which are not singular in their hermitian version , such as the @xmath0 symmetric scarf ii potential , which is defined on the full @xmath4 axis . in this case",
    "the second set of normalisable solutions originates from states which have complex eigen - energy in the hermitian case , but which turn into normalisable states with real energy when the potential is forced to become @xmath0 symmetric and the @xmath0 symmetry is not broken spontaneously @xcite .",
    "the two set of solutions are distinguished by the quasi - parity quantum number @xcite . * in the process of generating the spontaneous breakdown of @xmath0 symmetry by tuning the potential parameters it was found that the pairwise merging of the energy eigevalues and their re - emergence as complex conjugated pairs occurs at the _ same _ value of the potential parameter @xcite .",
    "in other words , the spontaneous breakdown of @xmath0 symmetry is realised suddenly in the case of shape - invariant potentials , as opposed to a gradual process observed in the case of numerical examples @xcite . * for certain exactly solvable ( and shape - invariant ) examples , such as the @xmath0 symmetric harmonic oscillator @xcite and the scarf ii potential",
    "@xcite it was found that there are _ two _ ` fermionic ' susy partners of the original ` bosonic ' potential , and they are distinguished by the quasi - parity quantum number carried by the ` bosonic ' bound states .",
    "( in the latter case this has also been found in other realisations of susyqm @xcite . )",
    "this doubling of the partner potentials is an obvious consequence of the fact that there are _ two _ nodeless normalisable solutions corresponding to the ` ground state ' in the two segments of the spectrum with quasi - parity @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , it was also established that the ` fermionic ' partner potentials are @xmath0 symmetric themselves too , in case the ` bosonic ' potential has unbroken @xmath0 symmetry , while they cease to be @xmath0 symmetric if the @xmath0 symmetry of the ` bosonic ' potential is spontaneously broken .",
    "the peculiar features mentioned above have been observed until now for the @xmath0 symmetric version of shape - invariant potentials , while potentials beyond this class often behaved in a different way .",
    "this naturally raises the question whether these features also characterise non - shape - invariant , but exactly solvable examples .",
    "natural candidates for this analysis are natanzon - class potentials @xcite which have the property that their bound - state solutions are written in terms of a _ single _ hypergeometric or confluent hypergeometric function .",
    "this potential class depends on six parameters , but it is prohibitively complicated in its general form , so its subclasses with two to four parameters have been analysed in detail until now @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most well - known member of the natanzon - class is the ginocchio potential , which has a one - dimesional version defined on the @xmath4 axis @xcite and a radial one , which has an @xmath12-like singularity at the origin @xcite .",
    "an important feature of this potential is that for a special choice of a potential parameter it reduces to a shape - invariant potential , namely to the pschl ",
    "teller hole ( in one dimension ) and to the generalised pschl ",
    "teller potential ( in the radial case ) .",
    "the one - dimensional version of the ginocchio potential has been analysed in an algebraic framework , and an su(1,1 ) algebra has been associated with it @xcite , the discrete non - unitary irreducible representations of which correspond to resonances in the transmission coefficients .",
    "( these states have been identified as quasi - bound states in an independent study @xcite . )",
    "furthermore , it was also shown that this algebra reduces in two different shape - invariant limits to an su(1,1 ) potential algebra and to an su(2 ) spectrum generating algebra @xcite .",
    "the phase - equivalent supersymmetric partners of the generalised ginocchio potential have also been derived in a completely analytic form @xcite .",
    "although the generalised ginocchio potential is an ` implicit ' potential , i.e. the @xmath13 function which is used to transform the schrdinger equation into the differential equation of the hypergeometric function @xmath14 is known only in an implicit form as @xmath15 , nevertheless , similarly to a number of other ` implicit ' potentials @xcite , this does not restrict the applicability of the formulae , because @xmath16 and the wavefunctions can be determined to any desired accuracy , and all the calculations involving these quantities ( matrix elements , etc . ) can be evaluated analytically @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we shall see that the imaginary coordinate shift which is essential to impose @xmath0 symmetry on the generalised ginocchio potential can also be implemented without complications .",
    "we note that a natanzon - class potential , the so - called dkv potential has already been analysed in the @xmath0 symmetric setting by the point canonical transformation of a shape - invariant potential @xcite , but it was found that it has to be defined on a curved integration path .",
    "nevertheless , it also showed similarities with @xmath0 symmetric shape - invariant potentials , as its spectrum was also richer that that of its hermitian counterpart .",
    "in section [ ggp ] we present the hermitian version of the generalised ginocchio potential for reference , and in section [ ptggp ] we construct its @xmath0 symmetric version .",
    "section [ sspt ] deals with the supersymmetric aspects of this potential , while in section [ conc ] a summary of the results is presented .",
    "the first version of the ginocchio potential was introduced as a one - dimensional quantum mechanical problem which is symmetric with respect to the @xmath17 transformation @xcite .",
    "later it was generalised to a radial problem @xcite , which also contains an @xmath12-like singular term at the origin .",
    "( this latter version of the potential also allows a particular functional form of an effective mass , but it can be reduced to a constant value by setting one of the parameters ( @xmath18 ) to zero . ) following the notation of ref .",

    "we get the ` simple ' ginocchio potential @xcite defined on the line .",

    "figure [ uxie ] shows the @xmath50 function for a particular value of @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "this function varies smoothly and it is odd under the @xmath0 transformation : @xmath53 , i.e. its real and imaginary components are odd and even functions of @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "asymptotically the relation @xmath54 holds , while near @xmath55 there is a ` kink ' in both the real and the imaginary component of @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath0 transform of @xmath56 is @xmath57 ( which can be seen analytically too by series expansion ) , and this also determines the @xmath0 transform of the potential ( [ ginpot ] ) . in particular",
    ", we may note that it contains @xmath58 everywhere as @xmath59 ( including also the term with @xmath60 ) , so ( [ ginpot ] ) is @xmath0 symmetric if all the coupling coefficients are _",

    "the latter two requirements allow the following values of @xmath64 and @xmath39 : @xmath65 we are going to discuss these possibilities later .",
    "let us now analyse the two independent solutions of the generalised ginocchio potential , written in the form hypergeometric functions . from among the possible linear combinations we chose the ones which have different behaviour at the origin in the @xmath66 limit : @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath18 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 have to satisfy the following relations : @xmath71^{1/2 } \\equiv\\pm \\omega\\ . \\label{abc}\\ ] ] with the conditions ( [ abc ] ) the two independent solutions can be written as @xmath72 @xmath73 note that the same two functions are obtained irrespective of the signs chosen in the first two equations in ( [ abc ] ) , while the sign of @xmath74 remains to be determined from the normalisability conditions of the wavefunctions .",
    "up to this point the functions ( [ hipg1x ] ) and ( [ hipg2x ] ) supply the general solutions for the energy eigenvalue @xmath75 . in order to obtain solutions belonging to discrete energy eigenvalues",
    "one has to set one of the first two arguments of the hypergeometric functions to the non - positive integer value @xmath76 , reducing them to jacobi polynomials @xcite .",
    "we find that in contrast with the hermitian case , normalisable solutions can be obtained in _ two _ different ways , corresponding to the condition @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 holds for ( [ hipg1x ] ) and ( [ hipg2x ] ) , respectively . in this case",
    "the two solutions can be written in a compact form as @xmath80 here @xmath9 is the principal quantum number labelling the bound states and @xmath81 is the quasi - parity @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "this quantum number characterises the solutions of @xmath0 symmetric potentials , but the potential itself does not depend on it .",
    "its name originates from the analysis of the @xmath0 symmetric version of the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator : in the hermitian limit of this potential ( i.e. for @xmath66 it essentially reduces to the parity quantum number .",
    "we see that the two solutions are distinguished by the @xmath82 quasi - parity quantum number , similarly to potentials belonging to the shape - invariant class .",
    "actually , the corresponding solutions of the @xmath0 symmetric generalised pschl  teller potential @xcite can be obtained by setting @xmath83 .",
    "it is also obvious that normalisability requires @xmath84 .    in order to obtain explicit expression for @xmath85 one",
    "has to combine ( [ polcond ] ) with ( [ abc ] ) and to solve a quadratic algebraic equation for @xmath86 : @xmath87^{1/2 } \\right ] \\label{munq}\\ ] ] this expression recovers the corresponding formula for the hermitian generalised ginocchio potential for @xmath78 .",
    "similarly to the case of the hermitian version of the generalised ginocchio potential the energy eigenvalues are written as @xmath88 , and they are independent of @xmath52 . actually , we find that for the @xmath78 choice the expressions for the hermitian problem are recovered formally .",
    "however , the forthcoming analysis will show that despite the similar form , some quantities can be chosen complex for the @xmath0 symmetric case . before going on",
    "we may note that @xmath85 , and consequently @xmath89 depends on the @xmath90 combination , and this leads to a degeneracy between levels with @xmath78 and @xmath79 whenever @xmath39 is a real half - integer number .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath91 states with opposite quasi - parity and with the same @xmath9 become degenerate : in fact , this is the point where the spontaneous breakdown of @xmath0 symmetry sets in if the @xmath39 parameter is continued to complex values allowed by ( [ slambda ] ) .",
    "let us now analyse the conditions for having real and complex energy eigenvalues @xmath89 , which corresponds to inspecting the nature of @xmath92 ( [ munq ] ) in terms of the allowed values of @xmath64 and @xmath39 displayed in ( [ slambda ] ) .",
    "these also have to be combined with the condition @xmath93 which guarantees normalisability of the solutions ( [ psinq ] ) .",
    "the key element of the analysis is the term containing the square root in ( [ munq ] ) , so it is useful to inspect separately the cases when it is real , imaginary or complex , which corresponds to @xmath94 , @xmath95 and complex @xmath96 , where @xmath97 we restrict our analysis to @xmath98 : the alternative choice , @xmath99 would change the nature of the @xmath27 function in ( [ ginru ] ) .",
    "we can note that @xmath39 occurs everywhere in the combination @xmath100 , so when @xmath39 is real , we can assume that @xmath101 , because the @xmath102 cases can be obtained simply by switching @xmath10 to @xmath79 .",
    "also , when @xmath103 , it is enough to assume @xmath104 for the same reason .",
    "* @xmath94 .",
    "this can happen only if @xmath39 is real , while from @xmath94 in ( [ ginsq ] ) and @xmath98 it follows that @xmath64 also has to be real . inspecting the allowed values of @xmath9 for various parameter domains we find the following .",
    "normalizable states can be obtained for @xmath92 in ( [ munq ] ) when @xmath105 holds",
    ". if the upper boundary of this domain is negative , then there are no normalizable solutions .",
    "this depends on the relative magnitude of @xmath64 and @xmath39 . *",
    "@xmath106 . here",
    "again @xmath39 has to be real , while @xmath64 can take both real and complex values allowed in ( [ slambda ] ) .",
    "the @xmath84 condition now reduces to @xmath107 , which has to be combined with @xmath106 .",
    "the resulting condition is then @xmath108 for real values of @xmath64 and @xmath109 for @xmath110 .",
    "note that these conditions can be met only for @xmath79 if @xmath39 is large enough ( and positive , as we assumed before ) .",
    "* @xmath96 is complex . for this @xmath103",
    "is required , while @xmath64 can be both real and @xmath110 .",
    "this situation corresponds to the spontaneous breakdown of @xmath0 symmetry , and the energy eigenvalues appear in complex conjugated pairs due to @xmath111 , which leads to @xmath112 . at the same time",
    "the @xmath84 condition turns out to be the same for @xmath10 and @xmath11 , in accordance with the expectation that the number of normalisable states has to be the same for both quasi - parities .",
    "the detailed analysis is more complicated for complex values of @xmath96 ( and @xmath39 ) than for real @xmath96 , so we can resort only to numerical calculations in this respect .",
    "the outcome depends on the relative magnitude of @xmath113 ( which is @xmath114 for complex values of @xmath64 ) and @xmath115 .",
    "we can now address the question whether with the tuning of the potential parameters the spontaneous breakdown of @xmath0 symmetry ( i.e. the appearance of complex conjugate pairs of eigenvalues ) happens at the same time for _ all _ the bound states as in the case of shape - invariant potentials @xcite , or gradually , as for some non - shape - invariant potentials , such as the @xmath0 symmetric square well @xcite . from the analysis above we find that when this mechanism is realised via setting @xmath39 to the complex value @xmath103 , then all the energy eigenvalues turn to complex at the same time .",
    "the spectrum can also be changed to complex by tuning @xmath64 from real to imaginary values and keeping @xmath39 real . since @xmath64 is contained in the formulae in the combination @xmath62 or @xmath116 which is always real , this possibility is more limited . in this case",
    "again all the energy eigenvalues turn into complex at the same time , but the character of the potential also changes , as its leading term in ( [ ginpot ] ) changes sign . in the hermitian setting this would correspond to replacing the potential well with a barrier , which obviously changes the nature of the problem .",
    "although in the @xmath0 symmetric version of ( [ ginpot ] ) the situation is less transparent , the complexification of the spectrum via tuning @xmath64 to complex values and keeping @xmath39 real is clearly different from the situation when @xmath64 is kept real and the spontaneous breakdown of @xmath0 symmetry is induced by tuning @xmath39 to complex values .    in figures",
    "[ examp1 ] , [ examp2 ] and [ examp3 ] the real and imaginary components of ( [ ginpot ] ) are plotted for fixed values of @xmath52 , @xmath51 and @xmath64 and for various values of @xmath39 corresponding to unbroken and spontaneously broken @xmath0 symmetry . the position of the energy eigenvalues are also indicated .",
    "a similar analysis can be performed for @xmath99 too . in this case",
    "the @xmath110 choice plays a more important role , but otherwise the results are qualitatively the same .",
    "note that in this case @xmath27 in ( [ ginru ] ) changes , and this also modifies the nature of the potential . before closing this section",
    "we mention briefly some aspects of the one - dimesional version of the ginocchio potential @xcite which is obtained from ( [ ginpot ] ) by the @xmath117 or 1 substitution .",
    "this limit is analogous to the one - dimensional version of the harmonic oscillator , which is also obtained from the radial harmonic oscillator after cancelling the singular centrifugal term , allowing the extension of the potential to the full @xmath4 axis .",
    "another similarity between the two systems is that the two choices of @xmath39 correspond to the even and odd solutions , and this can clearly be seen from the structure of the bound - state solutions ( [ ginbound ] ) , in which the jacobi polynomial reduces to an even and odd gegenbauer polynomial for @xmath117 and 1 , respectively @xcite .",
    "losing the @xmath39 parameter means that in the case of the @xmath0 symmetric one - dimensional ginocchio potential the spontaneous breakdown of @xmath0 symmetry can not be implemented as in the general case .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the quasi - parity quantum number occurs only in the combination @xmath100 , which means that the @xmath10 , @xmath117 combination is equivalent with @xmath79 , @xmath41 , and @xmath10 , @xmath41 is equivalent with @xmath79 , @xmath117 , and this reflects the relation of the quasi - parity quantum number with ordinary parity , similarly to the case of the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "it is also worthwhile to note that the hermitian version of the one - dimensional ginocchio potential possesses a number of complex - energy solutions ( resonances ) @xcite , and since the energy eigenvalues are not sensitive to the @xmath52 parameter appearing in the complex coordinate shift in ( [ ginrupt ] ) , these remain unchanged after the @xmath0 symmetrisation of the potential .",
    "however , these are unbound solutions , so their character is different from that of the ( normalisable ) complex - energy solutions which appear when the @xmath0 symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "according to ref . @xcite the supersymmetric partner of a @xmath0 symmetric potential depends on the quasi - parity @xmath81 , and thus corresponds to _ two distinct _ potentials . for this",
    ", the partner potentials have to be constructed by using a @xmath81-dependent factorization energy such that @xcite @xmath118 ^ 2 \\pm\\frac{{\\rm d}w^{(q)}}{{\\rm d}x}+\\epsilon^{(q)}\\ , \\label{vpm}\\ ] ] where @xmath119 is the ground - state energy of the ` bosonic ' potential , which , due to this construction is independent from @xmath81 , i.e. @xmath120 . the superpotential @xmath121 is expressed in terms of the ground - state @xmath122 wavefunction of @xmath123 ( [ ginpot ] ) @xmath124 and it clearly depends on @xmath81 explicitly ( in third term ) and implicitly via @xmath125 ( in the second term ) .",
    "the ` fermionic ' partner potentials of the generalised ginocchio potential contain the same terms as ( [ ginpot ] ) , but the coupling coefficients are different , and pick up @xmath81-dependence , as expected @xcite : @xmath126 @xmath127\\ , \\\\",

    "this was the case for some @xmath0 symmetric shape - invariant potentials too @xcite . when @xmath103 , which happens when the @xmath0 symmetry of ( [ ginpot ] ) is spontaneously broken , ( [ ginpotpart ] ) ceases to be @xmath0 symmetric , which is again a result similar to those obtained for shape - invariant potentials @xcite .",
    "figures [ examp1 ] , [ examp2 ] and [ examp3 ] display also the ` fermionic ' partners of the respective ` bosonic ' potentials . due to the susyqm construction the energy eigenvalues of the",
    "` fermionic ' partners are the same with the exception that the levels with @xmath128 and @xmath82 are missing from the spectrum of @xmath129 .",
    "the example in figure [ examp3 ] corresponds to the spontaneous breakdown of the @xmath0 symmetry of the ` bosonic ' potential , and thus the @xmath0 symmetry of the ` fermionic ' potentials is manifestly broken .",
    "this is indicated by the fact that the real and imaginary component of the potential ceases to have definite parity under space reflexion .",
    "however , the two ` fermionic ' potentials are the @xmath0 transforms of each other : @xmath130^*$ ] .",
    "note that for @xmath91 , i.e. for the point of the spontaneous breakdown of @xmath0 symmetry the two ` fermionic ' partners with @xmath10 and @xmath79 coincide .",
    "we analysed a natanzon - class potential , the generalised ginocchio potential in a @xmath0 symmetric setting in order to explore similarities and differences with the more restricted shape - invariant potential class .",
    "this work was inspired by the fact that up to now the exactly solvable @xmath0 symmetric potentials were almost exclusively members of the shape - invariant class , and they showed marked differences compared to examples outside this class , e.g. those which have been solved numerically or had quasi - exactly solvable character .",
    "our analysis showed that the @xmath0 symmetric generalised ginocchio potential shares all the specific properties of shape - invariant potentials . in particular , its states can also be characterised by the quasi - parity quantum number , and the spontaneous breakdown of its @xmath0 symmetry takes place suddenly , i.e. by tuning a potential parameter ( @xmath39 ) all its real energy eigenvalues turn into complex conjugate pairs at the same value of this parameter .",
    "these results seem to originate from the ` robust ' structure of the normalisable solutions of natanzon - class potentials , which allows the implementation of @xmath0 symmetry to these technically non - trivial problems .",
    "another similarity with the shape - invariant potentials is that the @xmath0 symmetric generalised ginocchio potential has two ` fermionic ' supersymmetric partners ( generated by eliminating the lowest state of the original ` bosonic ' potential with quasi - parity @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , and the partner potentials also possess @xmath0 symmetry as long as the @xmath0 symmetry of the ` bosonic ' potential is unbroken , but they cease to be @xmath0 symmetric when the @xmath0 symmetry of the ` bosonic ' potential is spontaneously broken .",
    "this seems to indicate that the properties thought to be specific to @xmath0 symmetric shape - invariant potentials might be valid to the much larger natanzon potential class too , and perhaps also beyond that .",
