    "quantum hypothesis testing ( qht ) is a fundamental topic in quantum information theory  @xcite , playing a non - trivial role in protocols of quantum communication and quantum cryptography  @xcite .",
    "the typical formulation of qht is given in terms of quantum state discrimination  @xcite , where a certain number of generally non - orthogonal quantum states ( the quantum hypotheses ) have to be discriminated by means of a quantum measurement .",
    "in particular , the simplest scenario regards the statistical discrimination between two non - orthogonal quantum states , corresponding to the ` null ' and the ` alternative ' quantum hypotheses , occurring with some a priori probabilities . in _",
    "symmetric testing _ , these hypotheses have the same cost  @xcite and the goal is to minimize the mean error probability of confusing them by suitably optimizing the quantum measurement .    for such a basic problem , we know closed analytical formulae identifying both the minimum error probability , given by the helstrom bound  @xcite , and the optimal quantum detection , expressed in terms of the helstrom matrix  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we can also use an easier - to - compute bound which becomes tight in asymptotic conditions .",
    "this is the recently - introduced quantum chernoff bound  @xcite , for which we know simple formulae in the case of multi - mode gaussian states  @xcite , ( i.e. , those states with gaussian wigner function  @xcite ) .    in this paper , we consider _ asymmetric _ qht , where two quantum hypotheses have different associated costs  @xcite . in this approach",
    ", we aim to minimize the probability that the alternative hypothesis is confused for the null hypothesis , an error which is known as ` false negative ' .",
    "this minimization has to be done by suitably constraining the probability of another possible error , known as a ` false positive ' , where the null hypothesis is confused for the alternative hypothesis .",
    "this is clearly the best approach for instance in medical - type testing , where the null hypothesis typically represents absence of a disease , while the alternative corresponds to the presence of a disease .",
    "asymmetric qht is typically formulated as a multi - copy discrimination problem , where a large number of copies of the two possible states are prepared and subjected to a collective quantum measurement . from this point of view , the aim is to maximize the error - exponent describing the exponential decay of the false negatives , while placing a reasonable constraint on the false positives . for this calculation , we can rely on two mathematical tools .",
    "the first is the quantum relative entropy  @xcite between the two states , while the other is the recently - introduced quantum hoeffding bound ( qhb )  @xcite , which performs the optimization of the error - exponent while providing a better control on the false positives .    in this work ,",
    "we start by giving some basic notions on asymmetric qht and briefly reviewing the qhb , also showing how its computation simply reduces to the quantum fidelity  @xcite in the presence of pure states .",
    "then , we provide a general recipe for computing this bound in the case of multimode gaussian states , for which  it can be expressed in terms of their first- and second - order statistical moments . in the general multimode case",
    ", we derive a relation between the qhb and other easier - to - compute bounds , which are based on well - known mathematical inequalities .",
    "finally , we derive analytical formulas and numerical results for the most important classes of one - mode and two - mode gaussian states .    by developing the theory of asymmetric qht for gaussian states",
    ", our work could be useful in tasks and protocols involving gaussian quantum information  @xcite , including technological applications of quantum channel discrimination ( e.g. , quantum illumination  @xcite or quantum reading  @xcite ) where we are interested in increasing our ability to accept one specific quantum hypothesis .",
    "in binary qht we consider a quantum system which is prepared in some unknown quantum state @xmath0 , which can be @xmath1  or @xmath2 .",
    "for instance we can imagine one party , say alice , who prepares such a system .",
    "this system is then passed to bob , who does not know which choice alice has made .",
    "thus , bob must decide between the following two hypotheses @xmath3 in order to discriminate between these two hypotheses , i.e. , distinguish between the two states , bob applies a quantum measurement , generally described by a positive operator valued measure ( povm ) . without loss of generality",
    ", bob can always reduce his measurement to be a dichotomic povm @xmath4 with @xmath5  @xcite . the outcome @xmath6 , with povm operator @xmath7",
    ", is associated to the null hypotheses @xmath8 , while the other outcome @xmath9 , with povm operator @xmath10 , is associated with the alternative hypothesis @xmath11 .    since the two quantum states @xmath1  and @xmath2 are generally non - orthogonal , there is a non - zero error probability to confuse the two hypotheses .",
    "we can identify two different types of error : type - i and type - ii errors , with associated conditional error probabilities . by definition , the type - i error , also known as a ` false - positive ' , is where bob accepts the alternative hypothesis @xmath11 when the null hypothesis @xmath8  holds .",
    "we have a corresponding error probability expressed by @xmath12 then , the type - ii error or ` false - negative ' is where bob accepts the null hypothesis @xmath8 when the true hypothesis is the alternative@xmath13 .",
    "this error occurs with conditional probability@xmath14    note that we can introduce other probabilities , but they are fully determined by @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "for instance , we may also consider the ` specificity ' or ` true - negativity ' of the test which is the success probability of identifying the null hypothesis , i.e. , @xmath17 which is simply given by @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , we may also consider the ` sensitivity ' or ` true - positivity ' of the test which is the success probability of identifying the alternative hypothesis , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "the costs associated with the two types of error can be very different especially in the medical and histological settings .",
    "for instance , in a medical test , @xmath8  is typically associated with no illness , while @xmath20  with the presence of the disease .",
    "it is therefore clear that we would like to have tests where the false - negative probability ( or rate ) @xmath16  is the lowest possible , so that ill patients are not diagnosed as healthy . for this reason , in a medical setting , hypothesis testing is almost always asymmetric , meaning that we aim to minimize one of the two conditional error probabilities .",
    "in general we can formulate the problem of qht as an @xmath21-copy discrimination problem  @xcite .",
    "this means that alice has @xmath21 quantum systems which are prepared in two possible multi - copy states@xmath22 these systems are passed to bob who performs a collective measurement on them . as before , this general povm can be chosen to be dichotomic @xmath23 with @xmath10 .",
    "the error probabilities now depend on the number of copies @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , the probability of false positives is given by@xmath24 and the probability of false negatives is@xmath25    in the limit of a large number of copies @xmath26 , these probabilities go to zero exponentially , i.e. , we have@xmath27 where the coefficients @xmath28 are called the ` error - exponents ' or ` rate limits '  @xcite .",
    "bob s aim is to  maximize the error exponent @xmath29 , so that the error probability of false negatives @xmath30 has the fastest exponential decay to zero .",
    "this must be done while controlling the rate of false positives . here",
    "a well known result is the ` quantum stein lemma '  @xcite which connects @xmath29  with the quantum relative entropy between the single - copy states @xmath1  and @xmath2 . for a large number of copies @xmath31",
    ", there is a dichotomic povm such that the error probability of the false positives is bounded @xmath32 and the error probability of false negatives goes to zero with error - exponent@xmath33    more powerfully , we may use the notion of the qhb  @xcite . for @xmath31 , there is a dichotomic povm such that the error - exponent of false positives is lower - bounded by a positive parameter@xmath34 and the error - exponent of false negatives satisfies@xmath35 where @xmath36 is the qhb defined by@xmath37 where @xmath38 is the ` s - overlap ' between the single - copy states @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "note that the quantum hoeffding bound enforces a stronger constraint on false - positives , since these are bounded at the level of the error - exponent and not at the level of the error probability as happens for the quantum relative entropy bound .",
    "asymmetric testing becomes very simple when one of the states ( or both ) is pure . in this case",
    ", we can in fact relate the qhb to the quantum fidelity between the two states .",
    "let us start by considering the case where only one of the states is pure , e.g. , @xmath39 .",
    "we can write  @xcite@xmath40 where @xmath41 is the fidelity between @xmath42 and @xmath2 .",
