    "an electromagnetic metamaterial is a man - made composite material comprising a periodic array of subwavelength inclusions .",
    "typically , a single metallic metamaterial inclusion can be considered as an _ lc _ resonance circuit with its inductance and capacitance influenced by its shape and dimensions .",
    "these resonators can collectively exhibit macroscopically observed effective values of permittivity and/or permeability that are not found in natural materials .",
    "various forms of resonant inclusions have been introduced to date , e.g. , a split - ring resonators ( srr ) for a magnetic response @xcite or a pair of cut wires for negative refractive index @xcite .",
    "because of the possibility of engineering electromagnetic material properties , metamaterials offer immense opportunities in improving existing optical designs along with exploring unprecedented devices such as superlenses @xcite and invisibility cloaks @xcite .    for these devices to function properly",
    ", the underlying metamaterials must be operated in the effective - medium regime , i.e. , the lattice constant or unit cell size should be much smaller than @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the operating , i.e. resonant , wavelength . under this condition",
    "a collection of metamaterial elements appears nearly homogeneous to incident waves and can be characterized by an effective permittivity and permeability .",
    "as the unit cell size approaches @xmath0 , diffraction effects and poor refraction become significant @xcite .",
    "these parasitic effects are detrimental to the performance of metamaterials in quasi - optical applications .",
    "for example , a large unit cell size imposes a limitation on the subwavelength resolution of a metamaterial superlens @xcite .",
    "when the cell size is comparable to or larger than a quarter - wavelength , the effective material parameters lose their relevance @xcite .",
    "there are however limits to size reduction , because simply shrinking the volume or area of metamaterial inclusions reduces the capacitance and inductance and hence disturbs other important characteristics of metamaterials . in order to preserve these characteristics , the inductance and capacitance per unit area must be increased accordingly .    in this paper ,",
    "a practical approach to reducing the electrical footprint of elc resonators is presented .",
    "section  [ sec : ie_review ] reviews some existing solutions to reduce the size of metamaterial resonators .",
    "section  [ sec : ie_idc_elc ] describes the design of idc - loaded elc resonators , along with a mathematical analysis based on lumped element theory . in section  [ sec : ie_experiment ] , simulation and experimental results obtained from the proposed resonators are discussed in terms of the transmission characteristics and the effective medium properties .",
    "several approaches can be implemented to increase the ratio between the operating wavelength and the unit cell size , i.e. the effective medium ratio , for various types of metamaterial resonators . in common ,",
    "these approaches are based on the idea of raising the overall inductance and capacitance , which are related to the resonance frequency through @xmath2 .",
    "a straightforward way is to change the feature sizes of the structure , i.e. , shorten gaps or lengthen wires to increase the capacitance and inductance , respectively .",
    "however , the realization of this simple approach can be limited by fabrication tolerances . as an alternative , increasing the permittivity or permeability of the host dielectric leads to a larger effective capacitance or inductance @xcite . despite a substantial reduction in the resonance frequency",
    ", the availability of the host medium with a high permittivity or permeability and low loss is an important issue .",
    "furthermore , at some point the effective permeability can no longer be increased , irrespective of the permeability of the substrate @xcite . by integrating a surface - mounted capacitor onto a resonator",
    ", its resonance frequency can be tuned down significantly @xcite . however",
    ", loading lumped capacitive elements complicates the fabrication process and is typically limited by their physical size in the microwave regime .",
    "a more sophisticated and specific approach involves redesigning the resonator pattern to accommodate a higher capacitance or inductance .",
    "as for example , a multiple srr ( msrr ) is an extension to a conventional srr , within which smaller split rings are nested to increase the parallel capacitance @xcite . with comparable dimensions , a spiral resonator ( sr ) has a larger capacitance than does a typical srr by at least fourfold @xcite .",
    "essentially , an increment in the structural capacitance results in a realizable unit cell size down to @xmath1/40 for an msrr and @xmath1/250 for an sr @xcite .",
    "fractal - based metamaterials with magnetic - field coupling similar to double srr s have been reported @xcite .",
    "the increased perimeter of the structure as a result of the fractal self - similarity leads to larger inductance and capacitance and a reduction in the resonance frequency .",
    "s - ring resonators that provide a double - negative response can be shrunken from @xmath3 to @xmath4 by winding parallel strips to increase the capacitance @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that all the redesigned structures do not provide a pure electric resonance .",
    "as a counterpart of the conventional magnetic srr , an elc resonator as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ie_elc0](a ) provides a pure electric resonance with neither magnetic nor magnetoelectric responses , since the collective magnetic flux is nullified by virtue of the resonator s mirror symmetry @xcite . in the quasistatic limit , where the resonator size is much smaller than its operating wavelength",
    ", an elc resonator can be approximated by the inductance and capacitance in the form of an _ lc _ resonance circuit , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ie_elc0](b ) . during operation ,",
    "an incident electric field with polarization perpendicular to the gap excites the capacitor to yield an electric resonance at @xmath5 .",
    "it was suggested that the resonance frequency of an elc resonator can be tuned down by introducing more loops , or equivalently more inductance , to both arms @xcite .",
    "however , the method requires additional fabrication steps , as the suggested structure is multilayered .",
    "other general approaches reviewed in the previous section might be adopted , with their respective limitations , to reduce the electrical size of the resonator .",
    "extends over the overlapping portion of all fingers . ]    a practical redesign of the structure presented in this article involves replacing the normal capacitive gap in the center of an elc resonator with an interdigital capacitor ( idc ) , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ie_idc ] , to increase the capacitance .",
    "essentially , idc s are widely used as lumped elements in microwave circuits @xcite with an aim to decrease their circuit board footprint . as such , its concept well suits metamaterials , where the unit cell needs to be much smaller than the operating wavelength .",
    "fabrication of idc s can be readily carried out with standard photolithographic techniques , since the feature size of an idc does not need to be finer than the gap width of an ordinary elc resonator to enhance the capacitance .",
    "the single - layered design of idc - loaded elc resonators eliminates additional fabrication steps that might be required in other approaches .",
    "the idea of using idc s with metamaterials has been realized in the transmission - line approach .",
    "composite right / left handed transmission lines ( crlh - tl s ) , which exhibit a band of negative phase velocity , are typically fitted with a set of idc s that act as series capacitors @xcite .",
    "in addition , idc s are also incorporated into microstrip - coupled tunable srrs aimed at enhancing the local electric field strength at the capacitors gaps @xcite .",
    "two variants for idc - loaded elc resonators are proposed and studied in this article .",
    "for the first configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ie_elcs](a , c ) , the capacitor s gaps are oriented perpendicularly to the intended polarization of operation , and the two ports are positioned at the outermost fingers on both sides . another configuration in fig .  [",

    "the ports are located at the terminal strips ( the strips that join fingers together ) .",
    "for the first configuration , the local electric field inside the capacitive gap aligns with the electric polarization .",
    "hence , this configuration is expected to perform better in terms of cell size reduction .",
    "it is worth noting that the mirror symmetry of the resonator is broken in the first configuration .",

    "sample elc1a ( elc2a ) has a lower resonance frequency compared to sample elc1b ( elc2b ) .",
    "a reduction in resonance frequency is stronger when the gaps of the idc are perpendicular to the polarization , as in elc1a and elc2a , which can be attributed to a better coupling between the incident electric field and the field in the capacitors . in terms of the effective medium ratio",

    "[ fig : ie_param ] shows the effective permittivity and permeability of the selected resonators .",
    "it is obvious that the resonance frequency in the permittivity curve is lowered by the influence of idc loading .",
    "the permittivity further illustrates a lower resonance strength and a higher effective loss tangent in idc - loaded elc resonators . despite that , the negative value of the permittivity is appropriate for typical applications requiring @xmath35 .",

    "the parameter retrieval suggests a tradeoff between the electrical size and absorption in the proposed structure .",
    "however , this issue can be partly alleviated by using a substrate with lower loss .",
    "an implication of metamaterial size reduction is the structural homogeneity , which leads to lower parasitic effects and hence a higher performance for quasi - optical applications .",
    "the idc - loading approach can be used in conjunction with other approaches to minimize the electrical size of elc resonators .",
