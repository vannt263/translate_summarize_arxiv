    "fluctuations play an important role in descriptions of nonequilibrium phenomena .",
    "a typical example is the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , which connects transport coefficients to fluctuations in terms of auto - correlation functions .",
    "this theorem can be traced back to einstein s relation @xcite , nyquist s theorem @xcite , onsager s arguments for reciprocal relations @xcite , etc . , and it was established in linear response theory in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics near equilibrium @xcite .",
    "another example of fluctuation theories is onsager - machlup s fluctuation theory around equilibrium @xcite .",
    "it is characterized by the usage of a functional integral technique for stochastic linear relaxation processes , and leads to a variational principle known as onsager s principle of minimum energy dissipation .",
    "many efforts have been devoted to obtain a generalization , for example , to the cases of nonlinear dynamics @xcite and nonequilibrium steady states @xcite .",
    "recently , another approach to fluctuation theory leading to fluctuation theorems has drawn considerable attention in nonequilibrium statistical physics @xcite .",
    "they are asymmetric relations for the distribution functions for work , heat , etc . , and they may be satisfied even in far from equilibrium states or for non - macroscopic systems which are beyond conventional statistical thermodynamics .",
    "originally they were proposed for deterministic chaotic dynamics , but they can also be justified for stochastic systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , laboratory experiments to check these fluctuation theorems have been made @xcite .    from our accumulated knowledge on fluctuations ,",
    "it is meaningful to ask for relations among the different fluctuation theories .",
    "it is already known that the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , as well as onsager s reciprocal relations , can be derived from fluctuation theorems near equilibrium states @xcite .",
    "the heat fluctuation theorem can also be regarded as a refinement of the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "the principal aims of this paper are twofold .",
    "first , we generalize onsager and machlup s original fluctuation theory around equilibrium to fluctuations around nonequilibrium steady states using the functional integral approach . for this nonequilibrium steady state onsager - machlup theory",
    "we discuss the energy conservation law ( i.e. the analogue of the first law of thermodynamics ) , the second law of thermodynamics , and onsager s principle of minimum energy dissipation . as the second aim of this paper",
    ", we discuss fluctuation theorems based on our generalized onsager - machlup theory .",
    "since the systems we consider are in a nonequilibrium steady state , the equilibrium detailed balance condition is violated .",
    "we propose generalized forms of the detailed balance conditions for nonequilibrium steady states , which we call _ nonequilibrium detailed balance relations _ , and show that the fluctuation theorem for work can be derived from it . to demonstrate the efficacy of nonequilibrium detailed balance as an origin of fluctuation theorems , we also show another form of nonequilibrium detailed balance , which leads to another fluctuation theorem for energy loss by friction .",
    "we also show how a heat fluctuation theorem can be derived from our generalized onsager - machlup theory , by carrying out explicitly a functional integral and reducing its derivation to a previous one discussed in refs .",
    "in addition , we give a simple argument leading to the long - time ( @xmath0 ) fluctuation theorem for heat , based on the independence between the work distribution and the energy - difference distribution .    in this paper , in order to make our arguments as concrete and simple as possible , we apply our theory to a specific nonequilibrium brownian particle model described by a langevin equation ( cf .",
