    "universality of qcd means that predictions are independent of the details of the microscopic interactions .",
    "this is crucial for predictivity , since the precise form of the fundamental interactions at very short distance scales is not known . in a large parameter space characterizing possible fundamental interactions , the qcd universality class corresponds , however , only to a certain domain . for other domains in parameter space ,",
    "the color symmetry may be `` spontaneously broken '' by the higgs mechanism , or all quarks may acquire a large mass due to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we are interested here in the transition from one domain to another and in the question of what happens at the boundary of the `` qcd domain '' .",
    "looking at qcd from a microscopic scale  say a unification scale @xmath4gev  its universality class is characterized by eight massless gluons and a certain number of massless fermions .",
    "perturbatively , the masses are protected by the gauge symmetry and chiral symmetries . at a much smaller scale around 1gev ,",
    "nonperturbative effects induce masses for all physical particles . in particular , the fermions become massive owing to chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath5sb  @xmath6 ) .",
    "this may be described by a nonzero expectation value @xmath7 of a `` composite '' scalar field . in order to keep the discussion simple , we concentrate here on the case of one quark flavor  generalizations to several flavors are straightforward .",
    "let us now consider a class of microscopic theories with a complex fundamental `` chiral scalar field '' @xmath8 which has the same transformation properties as @xmath9 and a classical potential @xmath10 the symmetries also allow for a yukawa coupling between @xmath8 and the quarks . for nonzero @xmath11 , the chiral symmetry is broken and the quarks become massive . in the case of large enough positive @xmath0 ( in units of some unification scale ,",
    "say @xmath4gev ) , the scalar field is super - heavy and decouples from the low - energy theory .",
    "this range of @xmath0 obviously corresponds to the universality class of qcd .",

    "the scalar field gets a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 related to @xmath17 and @xmath18 by renormalization corrections .",
    "both @xmath19 and the quark masses are of the order of the unification scale in this domain .",
    "the universality class now corresponds to gluodynamics without light quarks . in the chiral limit of a vanishing current quark mass ,",
    "spontaneous @xmath5sb  also generates a very light pseudo - goldstone boson in addition to the gluonic degrees of freedom .",
    "varying the microscopic scalar mass term @xmath0 from large negative to large positive values should lead us from the universality class with perturbative spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( p@xmath5sb  ) to the universality class of one - flavor qcd .",
    "one of the aims of this note is to understand the qualitative features of this transition in the vicinity of a critical value @xmath20 .",
    "this is clearly a nonperturbative problem , since on the qcd side of the transition the effective gauge coupling grows large .",
    "our investigation is based on a nonperturbative flow equation which is obtained by a truncation of the exact renormalization group equation for the effective average action @xcite .",
    "a crucial ingredient is the `` bosonization '' of effective multi - fermion interactions at every scale @xcite .",
    "this provides for a description of fundamental scalar fields and bound states in a unified framework . a theoretical method with this feature is actually required for our problem , since the scalar quark - antiquark bound states in the qcd description ( e.g. , the pseudo - goldstone eta meson and the sigma meson ) are expected to become associated with the fundamental scalar in the p@xmath5sb  description . in this framework , we see",
    "also how one relevant and two marginal parameters in the p@xmath5sb  universality class , namely the ones corresponding to the mass and quartic self - interaction of the scalar field and the yukawa coupling , become irrelevant for the qcd universality class .",
    "this remarkable change of the number of relevant parameters at the transition between the two universality classes is connected with the appearance of a bound - state fixed point for the flow of the scalar mass and self - interaction in the range of microscopic parameters corresponding to qcd .",
    "this bound - state fixed point is infrared attractive for all couplings except for the gauge coupling . under the influence of this fixed point ,",
    "all memory of the details of the microscopic interactions in the scalar sector is lost .",
    "this is exactly what is required for the qcd universality class which has the gauge coupling as the only marginal parameter ( for a massless quark ) . in order to see the appearance of the bound state",
    ", it is crucial to re - incorporate the effective multi - fermion interactions generated by the flow into the effective bosonic interactions .",
    "this avoids an unwanted redundancy of the description .",
    "it also solves an old problem in the investigation of gauged nambu ",
    "jona - lasinio models @xcite ; namely , how the presence of apparent relevant parameters in a too naive treatment of these models can be reconciled with qcd , where no such relevant parameters are present . in our approach ,",
    "the flow towards the bound - state fixed point solves this generic problem .    as a result of our investigation ,",
    "we find a qualitatively convincing picture of the transition between the two universality classes investigated .",
    "we have kept the truncation simple in order to illustrate the change in the number of relevant and marginal parameters in a simple way .",
    "the price to be paid is a limited accuracy in the quantitative description for parameter regions where the effective gauge coupling grows large . in our setting , this concerns primarily the quantitative details of the flow of the instanton - mediated interactions and the running of the strong gauge coupling .",
    "we emphasize that the qualitative picture does not require a detailed understanding of strong interactions in the momentum range where the gauge coupling is large .",
    "all decisive features are determined by the flow in a momentum range substantially larger than 1gev . in the same spirit ,",
    "we also have neglected other effective bosonic degrees of freedom which may correspond to additional bound states .",
    "we keep only the composite scalars and the gluons . when we proceed with our analysis to the strongly coupled gauge sector , we do not attempt to compute the gluodynamics , but simply model the strong interactions with an increasing gauge coupling ; for the latter , we use various examples discussed in appendix [ beta ] .",
    "we do not claim that our truncation of the gauge sector is sufficient in order to establish chiral symmetry breaking in qcd . a much more elaborate analysis",
    "would be needed for this purpose .",
    "we rather take the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the qcd universality class as a fact ( established by other methods and observation ) .",
    "we only require that a reasonable truncation should describe chiral symmetry breaking . beyond this ,",
    "the details of the truncation in the gauge sector are not relevant for our discussion of universality classes . despite these shortcomings",

    ", we identified a natural mechanism for the generation of extremely small scalar masses without fine - tuning .",
    "the mechanism exploits the fact that the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath25 symmetry would lead to an exactly massless goldstone boson in absence of the gauge interactions .",

    "owing to the highly different rg behavior of the scalar and the gauge sector , the scale of p@xmath5sb  differs generically from the scale of nonperturbative gauge effects by many orders of magnitude .",
    "this leads to an exponential suppression of the influence of the axial anomaly and thus to an exponentially small but nonzero scalar mass .    for theories with a fundamental scalar",
    ", the question arises as to whether our technique of fermion - boson translation is capable of describing all possible mesonic degrees of freedom .",
    "let us first look at two extreme situations .",
    "for a large negative renormalized scalar mass term , perturbation theory applies : there is a fundamental scalar , and separately propagating meson states may not exist - similar to a very heavy top quark . for a positive renormalized mass term , the fundamental scalar decouples from the low - energy sector in perturbation theory .",
    "the low - energy sector then is qcd without scalars , as in our picture .",
    "the transition is less obvious : in the region where the fundamental scalar mass would perturbatively be of the order of the strong interaction scale , there is a strong mixing between operators corresponding to fundamental and composite scalars .    in principle , in a situation with mixing the propagator in the scalar sector may have one or several pole - like structures that can be associated with particle excitations .",
    "our truncation can not fully resolve this issue , since , by construction , it follows the flow of only one pole in the propagator .",
    "our investigation shows the consistency of a picture with only one pole . if the true physical situation had two poles our truncation would follow the flow of the lowest mass .",
    "we see , however , no indication that a second pole actually exists .",
    "nevertheless , it seems worthwhile to discuss the possible implications of a second scalar `` pole '' for the issue of universality classes .",
    "first of all , for @xmath283 larger than but not in the immediate vicinity of @xmath280 , a `` second pole '' could correspond only to an additional heavy scalar particle .",
    "this would decay at a high rate into the qcd mesons , since no quantum numbers forbid such a decay .",
    "( one expects at most a resonance rather than a true pole . )",
    "furthermore , effects from the exchange of such a heavy scalar resonance would be suppressed by inverse powers of the mass and therefore play no role for the low - energy theory .",
    "this is what one usually understands by `` qcd universality class '' , ( a notion that is not thought to resolve the detailed short - distance physics ) .",
    "this issue becomes more interesting when @xmath283 is fine - tuned to the immediated vicinity of @xmath280 . in this case",
    ", we approach the _ boundary _ of the qcd universality class . we emphasize that this boundary is not uniquely defined in terms of the symmetries and particles characteristic for the qcd universality class .",
    "considering the qcd universality class from the viewpoint of a larger space of models or parameters , the spectrum of excitations that are relevant at the boundary can depend on the direction in parameter space from which the qcd universality class is approached .",
    "different directions may yields a differend `` number of poles '' in the boundary region .",
    "for this reason , a future more detailed investigation of this issue would be quite interesting .",
    "we stress that all of our main conclusions can be drawn from a mere perturbative knowledge of the gauge sector which is well under control . in a broader sense ,",
    "the pure qcd sector in our work can be regarded as a particular example for possible other ( nonperturbatively ) renormalizable theories leading to fermionic self - interactions in scalar channels .",
    "let us finally discuss our findings from a different perspective , concentrating on the scalar sector .",
    "scalar fields are known to lead to profound problems in quantum field theory for two reasons : triviality and ( un-)naturalness .",
    "triviality tells us that an interacting scalar theory requires a uv cutoff which can not be removed without switching off the interaction .",
    "therefore , whenever we see a scalar quantum field at some low scale , we know that there must be new physics at a higher scale .",
    "the problem of naturalness tells us that it is difficult to achieve a large separation of scales for models with interacting scalar fields without fine - tuning .",
    "our formulation has the potential to solve both problems .",
    "a first example can be given within the qcd universality class .",
    "although from a qcd perspective , the scalar field could be regarded as purely auxiliary , nothing prevents us from considering it as fundamental , since the concepts of compositeness and fundamentality are interchangeable from the viewpoint of our flow equation with field transformations .",
    "we showed in detail that `` standard '' qcd at low energies is indistinguishable from qcd with a fundamental scalar , as long as the latter system is in the qcd universality class .",
    "in this way , we can circumvent triviality by starting in the uv from a scalar field theory without self - interaction and yukawa coupling for which the continuum limit can be taken trivially .",
    "the scalar interactions are induced by quantum fluctuations . in this construction ,",
    "the system is always in the qcd universality class , and therefore inherits the number of relevant and marginal operators form qcd .",
    "in particular , the scalar mass term is not a relevant operator , so that no naturalness or fine - tuning problems arise in and from the scalar sector .",
    "alternatively , we could also follow the bound - state fixed point to @xmath284 , where it presumably becomes an exact fixed point even beyond our truncation .",
    "( the @xmath285 function for the running gauge coupling vanishes , owing to asymptotic freedom in this limit . )",
    "perhaps more interesting is a second possibility in the p@xmath5sb  class .",
    "let us consider for @xmath286 a scalar model with @xmath287 , @xmath288 and @xmath289 , @xmath290 chosen such that @xmath137 corresponds to the fixed point @xmath143 .",
    "this model has an alternative interpretation as a model with four - fermion interactions ( and no scalar field ) .",
    "both the gauge coupling and the critical four fermion coupling @xmath291 vanish for @xmath286 .",
    "if this fixed point persists beyond our truncation , it defines a nonperturbatively renormalizable theory @xcite . for lower @xmath62",
    "a nonzero @xmath18 is generated by the flow and we end up with a theory that effectively looks like a model with an interacting fundamental scalar field",
    ". this scalar field can give mass to the quarks by p@xmath5sb  independently of the strong interactions , in analogy to the higgs scalar .",
    "the triviality problem could be solved in this case  but not the naturalness problem , since we expect a relevant parameter corresponding to the scalar mass term .",
    "this discussion sheds new light on the continuous transition between the p@xmath5sb  and qcd universality classes . in the language of statistical physics",
    ", it can be considered as a type of crossover between the `` fundamental fixed point '' @xmath143 and the `` bound - state fixed point '' @xmath144 . as a particularity ,",
    "the gauge coupling is a marginal parameter for both fixed points .",
    "the scale where it becomes strong sets the lowest possible scale for the effective fermion masses .",
    "quite generally , the existence of a bound - state - like fixed point leads to a mechanism with a naturally small scalar mass . in a sense , this is a realization of earlier ideas of a large anomalous mass dimension for the scalar field or `` self - organized criticality '' @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to know if a similar mechanism could contribute to an understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking which occurs at a characteristic scale hundreds of times bigger as compared to qcd .",
