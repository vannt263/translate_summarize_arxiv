    "for the past few decades , advances in near - infrared ( nir ) detector technology have provided new and exciting discoveries of young clusters and star forming regions .",
    "for example , the partially embedded cluster ic  348 , which is the focus of this paper , was first observed in the infrared using a single channel photometer @xcite .",
    "however , such early observations were severely limited in both sensitivity and angular resolution , allowing for the detection of only the brightest embedded cluster members . for example , @xcite observed 25 possible stellar members of the ic  348 cluster with @xmath710.5 while discovering a few bright but heavily embedded ir sources .",
    "the development of nir infrared imaging arrays @xmath8 15 years ago , greatly enhanced our ability to study young clusters by not only improving the sensitivity and angular resolution of nir studies but also the areal coverage . for the first time",
    ", large scale ( @xmath8 square degree ) surveys of molecular clouds ( e.g. , orion b gmc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in particular of young clusters such as ic  348 @xcite were conducted .",
    "such surveys revealed the presence of hundreds of young stars over a wide mass range contained within the young clusters , increasing the number of stellar sources in ic348 by a factor of 15 and increasing the depth by a factor of 40 over earlier studies . while these early nir imaging surveys were clearly a vast improvement over surveys that had used single channel photometers , they were not without their limitations .",
    "in particular they required obtaining large mosaics containing tens to thousands of individual frames per wavelength band to cover the desired star forming area .",
    "for example @xcite obtained twenty four separate fields to cover the central parsec of ic  348 .",
    "consequently there was often a trade off between survey depth and area covered and , therefore in the case of many young clusters , obtaining a complete census of its members was still unattainable .",
    "the most recent advancements in nir detector technology have permitted the development of sensitive , wide - field infrared cameras such as flamingos ( * ? ? ?",
    "* elston et al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) , allowing more than an order of magnitude improvement in areal coverage and depth . in terms of young cluster studies ,",
    "these improvements now enable us to obtain a complete census of stars of all masses , even deeply embedded ( @xmath9 ) young brown dwarfs with masses as small as 10 jupiter masses , over the complete spatial extent of the cluster .",
    "observing the full angular extent of young clusters may be critical for obtaining a complete stellar census since recent theoretical studies show that mass segregation ( primordal or dynamical ) may be present in even the youngest embedded clusters @xcite .",
    "thus , for the first time we are poised to study the complete populations of young star clusters to below the hydrogen burning limit rather than focusing only on the stellar population of only the clusters cores .    since the @xcite nir survey",
    ", ic  348 has been the target of a number of wide - field optical @xcite , @xmath10  @xcite and x - ray imaging @xcite studies , and all have reinforced the ideas that ic  348 is partially embedded at the edge of the perseus gmc and ic  348 is spatially extended on the sky beyond its central core @xcite . with our current wide - field nir image",
    "we are able to survey an area encompassing nearly all the boundaries of these past surveys while simultaneously extending the @xcite nir survey depth by nearly 3 magnitudes .",
    "thus , we are able to detect very low mass sources ( @xmath11 ) over a much larger cluster volume ( larger extinction ) than any prior survey .",
    "we use the results of our infrared census to examine the cluster s structure , reddening and relationship to the perseus molecular cloud ( section [ sec : images ] ) and construct the cluster s differential @xmath4 band luminosity function ( section [ sec : lf ] ) . in section [ sec : imf ]",
    "we combine our deep survey , a spectroscopically determined age estimate for ic  348 from @xcite data , and our improved luminosity function modeling techniques ( * ? ? ? * hereafter , paper i ) to derive the imf of ic  348 across the stellar and sub - stellar regimes .",
    "@xcite found that the turnover in the ic  348 klf can be modeled by a similar peak and turnover in the underlying imf ; we expand on their finding by showing that the composite cluster imf forms a mode near 0.1 @xmath12 , turns over and declines throughout the brown dwarf regime down to near @xmath13 .",
    "our wide - field imaging also allows us to derive the cluster s stellar and sub - stellar imf over a much larger area than similarly sensitive surveys , which have concentrated on the cluster s central core ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , ntc00 ) . from this analysis",
    ", we compare our results for ic  348 and the trapezium ( paper i ) and discuss in section [ sec : discuss ] the impact of spatial or statistical imf variations on meaningful comparisons of the imfs for different clusters .",
    "we obtained wide - field near - infrared images of the ic  348 cluster using the florida multi - object imaging near - ir grism observational spectrometer ( flamingos , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the 2.1 m telescope at the kitt peak national observatory , arizona ( usa ) during december 2001 and february 2002 .",
    "the flamingos instrument employs a 2k hgcdte `` hawaii-2 '' imaging array , which when configured on the 2.1 m kitt peak telescope yields a @xmath14 field of view with a derived plate scale at @xmath4 band of @xmath15 .    on both 14 december 2001 and 08 february 2002 dithered sets of ic",
    "348 images were obtained with flamingos in the @xmath16 @xmath17 , the @xmath18 @xmath19 and the @xmath4 @xmath20 ( or  @xmath21 ) bandpass .",
    "these image sets were obtained within a narrow window of time ( 1.5 - 2.5 hrs ) and a restricted range of airmass ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "we list the details of these observations in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    "briefly , we employed a large number ( 15 - 50 ) of short ( 20 - 60 sec ) non - repeating dithers to yield total integration times of approximately 14 - 24 minutes , depending upon the bandpass .",
    "conditions on both nights appeared photometric , with no apparent cloud cover , stable background sky counts , and seeing estimates between @xmath23 on 14 december 2001 and @xmath24 on 08 february 2002 .",
    "two wide - field off - cluster images were similarly imaged in the @xmath4 or @xmath25  bands on 17 december 2001 and 11 february 2002 .",
    "these two non - overlapping regions lie approximately 1 degree east of ic  348 , along a line of constant galactic latitude with the young cluster .",
    "their equatorial field centers were : 1 ) @xmath26 ; @xmath27 ( j2000 ) ; and 2 ) @xmath28 ; @xmath29 ( j2000 ) .",
    "additional details of these off - field observations are also listed in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    "we reduced the sets of dithered frames with the april 2002 version of the flamingos data reduction pipeline ( elston et al 2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "local sky flat - fields were used for @xmath16 and @xmath18 bands , while dome flats were used for @xmath4 or @xmath25  bandpass .",
    "briefly , the flamingos data reduction pipeline is based upon a two - pass routine with object masking during the second pass that permits the creation of star - free median sky frames from the target images while following standard techniques for the reduction of near - infrared data . to take advantage of the relatively large number of dithers in our datasets , the pipeline employs the drizzle iraf routine @xcite to allow for linear sub - pixel image reconstruction during the final combination of the dithered frames . in summary ,",
    "6 reduced cluster images ( 2 at each bandpass ) were obtained , in addition to two @xmath4 band off - field images .    in figure",
    "[ fig : jhk_image ] we display a ( false ) color composite , near - infrared image of ic  348 using the @xmath16 , @xmath18 , and @xmath25  flamingos images from our february 2002 observations .",
    "a number of interesting cluster features are outlined by low - level nebulosity .",
    "these include the cluster core , which displays deep red nebulosity suggestive of somewhat higher extinction , and the interface between the ic  348 cluster and the molecular cloud all along the southern edge of the image .",
    "this interface region includes numerous signposts of very recent star formation including the hh-211 infrared jet @xcite , the enshrouded nir source deemed the `` flying ghost '' nebula @xcite , a dark lane suggestive of a flared , edge - on disk - like structure , and a number of bright infrared sources detected only in the @xmath4 band .",
    "a few image artifacts can also be seen in this figure .",
    "these include geometric distortions of the stars in the northeast corner of the image , red and green glint features due to internal reflections along the southern edge of the cluster , and coma - like ghosts south - southwest of the cluster center , resulting from a long time constant in one amplifier of the hawaii-2 array . on the other hand ,",
    "the alternating blue - green - red source located south - southwest of the cluster center is not an image artifact , but instead is the asteroid 545 messalina .",
    "we characterized each reduced image by deriving estimates of the fwhm of the stellar point spread function and the pixel - to - pixel noise in the background sky using the imexamine iraf routine , although the pixel - to - pixel noise is correlated in drizzled images .",
    "the resulting seeing estimates and @xmath30 detection limits are listed in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    "we find that the slightly better seeing and longer exposure times of the february data yielded detection limits approximately 1 magnitude fainter than the december observations .",
    "sources were initially identified on each reduced image using the stand - alone s - extractor package @xcite . in an iterative fashion , accurate centroids were calculated for the detected sources using the center iraf routine , and marked on the reduced images , after which the images were manually searched to identify false detections or to add sources missed near bright stars .",
    "the source lists for each of the 6 on - cluster images were then cross - correlated to identify and check those sources not appearing on all the images .",
    "multi - aperture photometry was performed on the sources using the apphot iraf package and the instrumental magnitudes were corrected out to the beginning of the sky annulus using photometric curves of growth calculated from @xmath31 bright stars using the mkapfile iraf routine . from the corrected multi - aperture photometry , we chose to use the smallest beamsize that simultaneously gave the most consistent photometry when compared to larger apertures . because of a spatially varying psf due to geometric distortions present in the final images , we resorted to using a rather large aperture ( radius = 5 pixels ; beamsize = @xmath32 ) , yielding aperture corrections typically of order @xmath33 magnitudes .",
    "absolute calibration of the instrumental photometry was performed using zeropoint and airmass corrections derived from @xcite standard stars , which were observed on the same night as the targets . for secondary calibration , we calculated and removed median zeropoint offsets of order @xmath34 magnitudes between our absolute photometry and the 2mass photometric system . because the natural system of our photometry is not known , the observed colors of our sources have not been transformed to the 2mass system .",
    "complete source lists for the flamingos ic  348 cluster observations presented in this paper , including equatorial positions and aperture photometry from the december 2001 and february 2002 datasets , will be made available electronically at the flamingos website at the university of florida .",
    "final products of the associated noao survey project , `` toward a complete near - infrared spectroscopic and imaging survey of giant molecular clouds , '' will be made available through the noao science archive .",
    "we quantified our photometric accuracy by directly comparing the photometry from the december and february images and by matching our data to the 2mass catalog .",
    "we list the results of our photometric comparison to 2mass in table [ tab:2mass ] .",
    "this table includes the magnitude range of the comparisons based on the flamingos saturation and 2mass photometric limits , the secondary calibration offsets applied in section [ sec : images : phot ] , and the @xmath35 dispersion between the datasets .",
    "while the 17 december off - field data display a dispersion of @xmath36 at k band relative to the 2mass catalog , we found @xmath37 dispersions in the 14 december on - cluster data that were larger than expected from purely photometric errors with the @xmath4 band scatter @xmath38 larger in the on - cluster frame than that found in the off - cluster frame taken three days later under similar sky conditions .",
    "we attribute some of this additional scatter to the intrinsic variability of young pms stars in ic  348 @xcite , which in the infrared typically peaks at @xmath16 band @xcite ( i.e. , for our ic  348 data @xmath39 versus @xmath40 mag ) .",
    "between 03 - 11 february 2002 , oil from the primary mirror cell contaminated the flamingos dewar window .",
    "this contamination had a negligible effect on our @xmath16 and @xmath18 band photometry since these data were flat - fielded with local , contemporaneous sky flats .",
    "however , the @xmath4 data were flat - fielded using non - contemporaneous dome flat - fields and display a @xmath41 increase in the photometric scatter relative to the flamingos data obtained in december and to the 2mass catalog .",
    "this scatter does not affect the analysis or conclusions of this paper .",
    "after considering the different saturation , detection and noise limits of the december and february ic  348 flamingos data , we produced a single working source list with photometry drawn from both flamingos datasets .",
    "we chose to use the december @xmath4 band data down to @xmath42 .",
    "below this value we transitioned to the intrinsically deeper february @xmath43  data . in the @xmath16 and @xmath18 bands we averaged the two datasets between the saturation and the detection limits of these respective catalogs , recording the @xmath35  standard deviation between the two observations . for the brightest 39 stars , which were saturated in one or more bands on all of our images",
    ", we substituted the 2mass photometry for our flamingos photometry .",
    "finally , for the faintest objects ( @xmath44 ; @xmath45 ; @xmath46 ) we used smaller aperture photometry ( radius = 3.5 pixels , aperture correction = @xmath47 mag ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cmag_all ] we present the infrared color - magnitude diagrams ( @xmath48 vs @xmath18 and @xmath49 vs @xmath4 ) for the flamingos ic  348 region without filtering for photometric error .",
    "we compare the distribution of sources in these diagrams to the location of pre - main sequence isochrones taken from the @xcite and @xcite evolutionary models . for these comparisons",
    "we assume a cluster mean age of 2 myr and a distance of 320 pc ( see sections [ sec : imf : sfh ] and [ sec : imf : dist ] for further discussion of these parameters ) .",
    "for these cluster parameters we find that we are sensitive to a 2 myr , @xmath50  object at the hydrogen burning limit seen through @xmath51 magnitudes of extinction or a @xmath52  brown dwarf near the deuterium burning limit seen at an @xmath53  ( using the * ? ? ?",
    "* theoretical models ) .",
    "three general characteristics of the sources projected towards our ic  348 flamingos region are clearly seen : 1 ) the color - magnitude diagrams indicate a cluster region having only modest reddenings relative to other star forming regions , with the vast majority of the sources having @xmath54 ; 2 ) there is a density of sources between @xmath55 that is closely outlined by the pms isochrones and represents a range of magnitude space that appears dominated by likely cluster members ; 3 ) below @xmath56 the color - magnitude distribution appears to become dominated by field - stars ( and likely galaxies ) as indicated by a rapid increase and steady broadening in the density of sources on these plots .",
    "all of these features were seen in individual datasets ( december vs february ) and were not modified if we changed any of the parameters for merging the data ( e.g. , the use of @xmath4 instead of @xmath25 data for the faintest objects ) .    in figure [ fig :",
    "jhk ] , we display the infrared @xmath49 vs @xmath48 color - color diagram for sources in the ic  348 region .",
    "we include sources most likely to be cluster members by using characteristics ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of the color - magnitude diagrams listed above to apply a somewhat arbitrary @xmath57 magnitude limit .",
    "the `` cluster sample '' resulting from this magnitude cut should be complete for unreddened 2 myr brown dwarfs down to @xmath58 and for @xmath59 brown dwarfs seen through @xmath60 .",
    "there are 580 sources with @xmath61 of which 563 have @xmath37 photometry ; we display all of these in the color - color diagram without filtering for error .",
    "again , it is clear that the cluster region is only marginally reddened with the nearly all of the sources having @xmath54 .",
    "the overwhelming majority of the sources fall within a locus bounded by the reddening vectors for the giant branch and the tip of the m dwarf sequence .",
    "while one source has nir colors significantly to the left of the reddening band , @xmath62 sources have infrared colors which lie to the right of the reddening vector for m9 dwarfs ( @xmath63 ; * ? ? ?",
    "these sources fall into a region of infrared excess in the color - color diagram , which because ic  348 is a very young cluster are considered to be likely cluster members with optically thick , circumstellar disks .",
    "finally , 42 of these sources exhibit infrared excesses greater than their @xmath35 photometric noise , and we note that these filtered sources span the entire range of h band magnitude both above and below the expected luminosity of the hydrogen burning limit . with these basic observational results we examined the structure of the ic  348 cluster .      for our subsequent analysis of the luminosity and mass function of ic  348",
    "we wished to select that portion of the flamingos wide - field image that provides the best sampling of the overall cluster .",
    "studying a region somewhat similar in size to the flamingos area , @xcite used a surface density analysis to show that ic  348 could be broken into 9 apparent sub - clusterings spread across their survey region .",
    "although subsequent wide - field @xmath64",
    "@xcite and optical @xcite surveys covered areas similar to ll95 , most studies of the imf of ic  348 have concentrated on the central ll95 sub - cluster , ic348a ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; ntc00 ) and have not included the other ll95 sub - clusters .",
    "while existing optical and @xmath64  studies may systematically underestimate the cluster size due to extinction or miss members that do not display @xmath64  emission , they have confirmed that the cluster is in fact spread over an area larger than the ic348a region . using the deeper wide - field near - infrared imaging provided by our flamingos observations , we re - investigated the structure of the ic  348 cluster by calculating the cluster s radial profile and by examining the spatial distribution of sources .      in figure",
    "[ fig : rad_prof ] we construct the radial profile of sources in the flamingos ic  348 region , centering on the ic  348a sub - cluster .",
    "we use only those sources for which @xmath61 and calculate the surface density in stars per square degree using both annuli of equal width and annuli having constant areas .",
    "we compare the resulting radial profiles to the field star surface density calculated from our off - field data .",
    "clearly the cluster exceeds the unreddened background surface density over most of the flamingos region .",
    "specifically , the cluster extends over an area considerably larger than the ic348a sub - cluster , whose radius was given as @xmath65 pc ( @xmath66 ) in ll95 and over an area larger than the radius of @xmath67  calculated by @xcite .",
    "the cluster appears to dip to the unreddened background surface density at a radius of @xmath68 ; however , since this radius is also where the profile begins to clip the edge of the survey region , we can not confidently rule out a larger cluster radius using the current flamingos image . at the distance of ic  348 ,",
    "this translates to a cluster radius of @xmath69 , similar to the effective radius of @xmath70 derived by @xcite .    to provide a means for comparing our study to that of other authors",
    ", we separated our flamingos cluster region into two sub - divisions based upon the radial profile and assigned these two sub - regions primarily functional names , e.g. , the cluster `` core '' sub - region with a radius = @xmath71 and the cluster `` halo '' region between the cluster `` core '' and a radius of @xmath72 , corresponding to the largest unclipped radius permitted by the current flamingos survey .",
    "the core region approximately represents the ic  348a sub - cluster but is slightly larger than that area studied by @xcite and ntc00 , while the halo region covers an area approximately 3.3 times that of the core and encompasses the stars contained in the sub - clusters designated _ b - i _ by ll95 .",
    "naturally , we are viewing a three - dimensional cluster in projection , such that true `` halo '' sources will also be present in the cluster s `` core '' sub - region , and therefore will somewhat blur the meaning of our division of the cluster by area .",
    "although our construction of the cluster s radial profile allowed us to divide the spatial extent of ic  348 within our survey region , we found that it follows neither a simple @xmath73 nor a king profile .",
    "we fit both analytical profiles to the cluster s constant area annuli profile , varying the radial extent of the fits , and for the king profile , allowing both the core and tidal radii to vary freely .",
    "neither analytic profile provided reasonable @xmath74  fits to the entire cluster profile .",
    "as we display in figure [ fig : rad_prof ] , the tail of the cluster profile , ( i.e. , the halo sub - region ) , is much flatter than either of the analytic profiles , and this is likely the reason @xcite derived a smaller cluster radius .",
    "one interpretation of these fits is that the ll95 sub - clusters , which constitute the cluster s halo , are actually separate entities , rather than being statistical fluctuations on a @xmath73 cluster profile .",
    "our construction of the ic  348 radial profile and the subsequent analytical fits likely suffer from two problems .",
    "first , we use circular annuli , while , as we will show in figure [ fig : spatial]b , the cluster is elliptically elongated in the n - s direction .",
    "second , we rely upon an empirical estimate of the field - star surface density from a region near to ic  348 but that , in principle , could fluctuate between this location and the background relevant to ic  348 .",
    "indeed , the surface densities of the two off - cluster locations fluctuate more than expected purely from counting statistics despite their similar galactic latitudes .",
    "this spatial fluctuation , however , is exceedingly small relative to the excess surface density of the cluster halo and will not likely affect the cluster boundary we derive .",
    "on the other hand , the obscuration of background field stars by the parental molecular cloud will lower the expected field star surface density and will affect the derived cluster radius , as we illustrate in figure [ fig : rad_prof ] .",
    "reddening the background by the average extinction in the ic  348 region(@xmath75 ; see section [ sec : images : redden ] ) only expands the cluster radius by @xmath76 , however , and the cluster probably does not exceed a radius of @xmath77 ( 1.4pc ) , which is a boundary traced very clearly by wide - field x - ray detections @xcite .      with the purpose of characterizing our two cluster sub - regions , we examined the spatial distribution of the ic  348 flamingos sources , plotting them using separate symbols for different luminosity ranges in figure [ fig : spatial]a .    by segregating the two sub - regions ,",
    "we find , for example , that there are as many relatively bright sources @xmath78 ( i.e. , with @xmath79 ) in the cluster core as in the cluster halo .",
    "since there are only a handful of early ( b or a ) type stars in ic  348 , there is no statistically meaningful way to show that the 3 ba stars in the cluster core are `` segregated '' relative to the 2 a stars and the b0iii star @xmath80 persei in the cluster halo . on the other hand , the faintest sources ( @xmath81 ) do show some spatial variations , with a sharp decrease in these sources along the cluster s southern edge , outlining the interface of the cluster with the molecular cloud .    in figure",
    "[ fig : spatial]b , we display a surface density plot of ic  348 from the 580 sources with @xmath61 used to construct the cluster s radial profile ( see figure [ fig : rad_prof ] ) and smoothed with a box filter at the nyquist sampling .",
    "the box filter had a width of @xmath82 or an area roughly equivalent to the area of the annuli used in the radial profile . at this resolution ,",
    "only a smooth n - s elongated cluster is seen with no significant sub - clusterings .",
    "we confirmed , however , that if we use the same spatial resolution as the @xcite study ( @xmath83 ) , we recovered most of the sub - clusters identified by ll95 and that now lie in the cluster s halo .",
    "further , these surface density contour maps display no apparent correlation to the location of the cluster - cloud interface region at either resolution .",
    "lastly , we examined the locations of the 66 sources displaying nir excess . as was found by ll95 ,",
    "the majority of these sources lie outside of the cluster core",
    ". moreover , the surface density of these nir excess sources appears to increase toward the southern interface with the perseus molecular cloud , opposite to the trend in the distribution of the faintest objects .",
    "these patterns suggest that many of the nir excess sources are correlated to and likely embedded within the molecular cloud , and may be associated with the most recent star formation events in the ic  348 region .",
    "we also used the sources observed within the ic  348 region as line of sight probes of the parental molecular cloud , allowing us to characterize the reddening that would be seen towards cluster members or background field - stars . building upon methods developed in @xcite and @xcite and our recipe(s ) described in @xcite , we calculated individual extinction estimates for each source by de - reddening the sources infrared colors to a locus of assumed intrinsic colors in the @xmath84 vs @xmath85 color - color diagram .",
    "these extinction estimates were used to create reddening maps of the cluster region and show that ic  348 is primarily foreground of the remnant molecular material .",
    "further , we binned these individual @xmath86  estimates into extinction probability distribution functions ( hereafter known as epdfs ) , which we will use when estimating the number of interloping field - stars and when calculating luminosity function models to interpret the observations .",
    "we calculated individual @xmath87   for sources falling into two different luminosity ranges , dividing them into sets that are likely dominated by either cluster members or background field - stars .",
    "we separated the `` bright  cluster '' and `` faint  background '' samples based upon their location in the @xmath84 vs @xmath4 color - magnitude diagram relative to the reddening vector of a source at @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the `` faint '' sample was also limited to objects brighter than a reddening vector for a source at @xmath90 .",
    "the two magnitude samples were de - reddened back to different loci of assumed intrinsic colors .",
    "the `` bright '' sources were assumed to be young pms stars with masses as small as @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath92 of these have @xmath37 colors and were de - reddened back to the classical t - tauri star ( ctts ) locus in the @xmath37 color - color diagram ( * ? ? ?",
    "* slope = 0.58 ; @xmath48 intercept = 0.52 ) , while the remaining @xmath93 were assigned an intrinsic @xmath49 color = 0.5 and @xmath87  estimates derived .",
    "the `` faint '' sources were assumed to be dominated by field m dwarfs and those with @xmath37 colors ( @xmath94 ) were de - reddened back to a linear approximation of the m dwarf branch in the color - color diagram ( from k6 to m9 , slope = 0.16 ; @xmath48 intercept = 0.61 ) , while the remaining @xmath95 lacking @xmath16 band were assigned an intrinsic @xmath96 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : av_map ] we present the resulting extinction maps derived from these two samples . both maps clearly define the location of the cluster - cloud interface along the region s southern border , while they also outline a ne - sw band of reddening that passes through the cluster s core , similar to the cluster s n - s elongation .",
    "one straightforward conclusion from the spatial variations in either reddening map is that the ic  348 region can not be characterized by a single mean @xmath87  value . although the two @xmath87  maps are physically very similar , the reddening seen by the background stars is in general larger than that foreground to the cluster members , indicating that the remnant molecular cloud lies primarily behind the cluster core rather than in front of it .      in figure",
    "[ fig : hk_av ] we plot the normalized histograms of the ( @xmath49 ) color and of @xmath87  for sources in the two magnitude ranges defined in the previous section and separate them further by cluster sub - region . as expected from the @xmath87  maps , the faint sources color and @xmath87  distributions are broader and redder than the bright , likely cluster stars , although the epdfs of the likely cluster members in both regions appear somewhat similar .",
    "applying a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov test to the @xmath87 values derived from bright and faint sources in the cluster core , we found that it is unlikely that they are drawn from the same @xmath87  distribution , having a ks probability of only 0.00024 .",
    "this is in contrast to the halo sub - region , where the bright and faint stars have a 0.23 probability of being drawn from the same @xmath87   distribution .",
    "similarly the bright stars in the core and halo have a 0.043 probability of being drawn from the same distribution while the faint stars in both regions can not , ruled out at the @xmath97 confidence .",
    "taken together , the epdfs and these statistical tests support two basic conclusions about the reddening seen towards ic  348 : 1 ) there is a measurable difference in the reddening seen by the background stars between the core and halo sub - regions , owing to the cluster lying in front of substantial molecular material ( also see figure [ fig : av_map]b ) ; 2 ) the bright , likely cluster members of the core and halo appear to have fairly similar reddenings , despite the projection of the entire region onto various pieces of the perseus gmc .",
    "the normalized @xmath87  histograms ( i.e. , epdfs ) are generally skewed to @xmath98 and are quite non - gaussian , again indicating that a single @xmath99 value is inappropriate to describe the cluster reddening . on average",

    "deviation = 2.6 , median = 3.3 ) .",
    "these latter averages are roughly the same as the @xmath104 assumed by ll95 for the entire ic  348 region .",
    "more meaningful comparisons can be made to those studies that have used spectroscopic observations to derive individual @xmath87 estimates .",
    "our @xmath99 estimates are consist with the @xmath105 derived by @xcite over a large cluster area .",
    "in the core , we compared our @xmath87 estimates to the @xmath106 estimates derived in ntc00 using spectral types that were derived from narrowband imaging , and which was in principle deep enough to probe the extinction seen to background stars . from 106 matched sources south relative to the positional grid defined by 2mass . ] with non - zero extinction estimates in both catalogs , we find that they are fairly similar , with @xmath107 compared to @xmath108 for our work .",
    "direct comparison of the epdfs constructed from these two studies confirmed that they appear consistent with the ntc00 epdf being somewhat broader . the effective difference , ( @xmath109 between the @xmath110 ) , between these epdfs is much smaller than the bins of the @xmath4 band luminosity functions we are employing in our subsequent mass function analysis .",
    "thus , it should not affect our derivation of and overall conclusions about the imf of ic  348 .",
    "on the other hand , it may bring added uncertainty to our statistical census of very low mass brown dwarfs ( @xmath111 ; see also section [ sec : discuss : imf_klf : substar ] ) . since our study is better sampled ( using more stars ) and probes a much larger volume of the cluster region than prior studies , we used the epdfs derived here when correcting for background field - stars ( section [ sec : lf : fieldstar ] ) and when modeling of the cluster s luminosity function ( section [ sec : imf : model ] ) .",
    "we constructed the raw infrared ( @xmath37 ) luminosity functions ( lfs ) for sources in the flamingos ic  348 region by using relatively wide ( 0.5 mag ) bins and by restricting the sources to those in an area bounded by the @xmath72 radius . when we compared the @xmath16 , @xmath18 and @xmath4 band ic  348 lfs , we found that all of them display a double peaked structure : the first peak lying at @xmath112 and the second between @xmath16 = 17.5 and @xmath4 = 16.5 . following our analysis of the cluster s color - magnitude diagrams in section [ sec : images : results ] ,",
    "we interpret the brighter of these peaks to be sources in the ic  348 cluster and the fainter peak to be dominated by background field - stars and galaxies .    in figure",

    "further , we compare them to the un - reddened field - star klf constructed from our off - cluster k band datasets . confirming our preliminary study of the cluster s structure from the radial profile , both sub - regions display a considerable excess of sources relative to the field - star klf for @xmath61 .",
    "both sub - region klfs reach bright peaks although they occur in somewhat different locations with the core klf , for example , peaking 1.5 magnitudes brighter than the halo . below these bright peaks , both klfs flatten or turnover before rising , parallel to the field - star klf .",
    "while the faint klf peak of the two sub - regions have nearly identical size and structure , they appear to be smaller and shifted to fainter magnitudes then the field - star klf . such differences",
    "could certainly be caused by the reddening and obscuration of background field - stars due to the molecular cloud .",
    "thus , we used our detailed study of the cluster reddening properties ( section [ sec : images : redden ] ) to estimate the size of the field - star contribution to the observed klfs .      to statistically estimate the field - star contribution to the raw ic  348 klf(s )",
    ", we used a monte carlo integration to convolve this control klf with the effects of a reddening probability distribution function that characterizes the the molecular cloud .",
    "we treated the cluster s core and halo sub - regions separately , and we used the extinction probability distribution functions derived in section [ sec : images : redden ] from the fainter , likely background stars de - reddened to the m dwarf locus . in figure(s ) [ fig : diffs]ab we compare the raw klfs to the reddened field - star klfs appropriate to that sub - region , scaling the reddened field - star klf _ only _ by the ratio of the off - cluster area to the physical area of the cluster or sub - region .",
    "the reddened field - star klfs very closely match the raw klfs for @xmath81 in both sub - regions , although they exceed the cluster klfs at the faintest magnitudes because they were not filtered to match our detection limits .",
    "we subtracted these reddened field - star klfs from the raw cluster klfs , and display the resulting differential klfs in figures [ fig : diffs]cd , constructing error bars that are the @xmath35 counting statistics of the sum of the cluster and reddened field star klfs .",
    "the structure of the differential klfs is significant for the bins brighter than @xmath113 , below which the field - star correction clearly over - estimates the observations .",
    "this magnitude limit corresponds to a 10@xmath114brown dwarf at the 2 myr mean age we assumed for ic  348 . above this limit",
    "two sub - regions have a nearly identical number of members , with the core containing @xmath115 sources with @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) and the halo containing @xmath118 sources with @xmath116 ( @xmath119 ) . while the sub - region klfs are well populated for @xmath61 , at fainter magnitudes the substantial field - star corrections yield very large uncertainties in the klf structure .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cluslf ] we directly compare the sub - region differential klfs and sum them to construct the overall cluster klf . again , the differences in the structure of the two sub - region klfs are obvious to the eye , with the peak of the halo klf skewing significantly to fainter magnitudes , before strongly turning over . while the peaks of the sub - region klfs are clearly distinct , the klfs are similar to within their @xmath35 error bars in most bins but separated by @xmath120 in the @xmath121 bins .",
    "a two sample chi - square test of the two histograms ( range : @xmath122 ) yielded a probability of 0.04 that they are drawn from the same parent distribution , indicating that these sub - region klfs are different at the @xmath123 level .",
    "when the two sub - region klfs are summed together , the complete cluster klf has a very broad peak between @xmath124 before decreasing very sharply to @xmath57 . for the combined cluster klf",
    "despite the large uncertainties at faint magnitudes the composite klf has a statistically significant number of cluster members with @xmath81 .",
    "further , we found that if we increased the size of the field - star correction by using a bluer extinction distribution function ( one relevant for the cluster stars ) , the main cluster klf characteristics were not substantially altered , although the size of the very faint population is almost halved .",
    "to analyze the ic  348 differential @xmath4 band luminosity function(s ) constructed in section [ sec : lf ] we used our model luminosity function algorithm first presented in @xcite and expanded in paper i. our goal was to place constraints on the initial mass function of ic  348 by deriving that mass function or set of mass functions whose model luminosity functions best fit the cluster klf .",
    "for the purpose of comparing our work to other studies , we individually analyzed the klfs of the two cluster sub - regions as well as the composite cluster klf .",
    "since a young cluster s luminosity function is the product of an age dependent mass - luminosity relation and the cluster s imf , we examined both the star forming history of ic  348 as derived by existing spectroscopic studies ( section [ sec : imf : sfh ] ) and the appropriate theoretical mass - luminosity relations ( section [ sec : imf : dist ] ) .",
    "we then fixed these quantities and derived the cluster imf ( section [ sec : imf : model ] ) .      to derive accurate mass function for a young ,",
    "partially embedded cluster , our method requires a good estimate of the cluster s mean age @xcite .",
    "we examined published spectroscopic studies of ic  348 , which provide individual age estimates for a reasonable large number of members . in figure",
    "[ fig : sfh ] , we plot a histogram of the ages derived by @xcite using the de - reddened @xmath125  color - magnitude diagram for candidate pre - main sequence members in an 112 square arc - minute region of ic  348 .",
    "we merged the ages of stars with and without detectable @xmath64  emission and derived an ensemble cluster mean age of @xmath126 myr .",
    "we approximated the age spread of ic  348 to be @xmath127 myr , corresponding to constant star formation from 0.5 to 3.5 myr ago , and we note that this age spread is 2.5 times longer than that we approximated for the younger trapezium cluster .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : sfh ] that our assumed star forming history closely approximates the bulk of the @xcite sfh , but clips the `` older '' tail of this distribution .",
    "we did not include this `` older '' tail in our sfh of ic  348 for the following reasons : 1 ) observational uncertainties ( for example , membership criteria or errors in photometric and spectral classification ) in the derivation of de - reddened color - magnitude or theoretical hr diagrams lead to exaggerated star forming histories , specifically resulting in artificially inflated cluster s age spreads @xcite ; 2 ) a number of the `` oldest '' ic  348 objects analyzed in the ntc00 nicmos study were also found to be the reddest cluster objects , suggesting to us that they are background interlopers ; 3 ) our assumed age spread very closely approximates that sfh derived by @xcite , who found that the star formation in ic  348 began approximately 3 myr ago with negligible star formation at older ages , and finally ; 4 ) model luminosity functions are very insensitive to the assumed age spread @xcite .",
    "further , @xcite found no dependence of the sfh on location within ic  348 .",
    "thus , we used the same star formation history when modeling both the ensemble cluster and the cluster s `` core '' and `` halo '' sub - region klfs .",
    "@xcite included an extensive discussion on the distance to ic  348 based upon literature sources existing at that time .",
    "arguing that closer distances ( @xmath128  pc ) were systematic under - estimates , he chose a distance for ic  348 ( 320 pc ) based in part upon the fact that within the current uncertainties , one could not differentiate between the distance to ic  348 ( @xmath129  pc * ? ? ? * ) and to the perseus ob2 association ( @xmath130  pc * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "recent studies of this regions using hipparcos data do not appear to have resolved the distance uncertainty between the perseus ob2 association and the ic  348 cluster .",
    "@xcite derived a distance of @xmath131  pc for 17 members of the perseus ob2 association spread over a projected @xmath132 pc area , while also statistically estimating the number of interlopers .",
    "a study by @xcite , including a larger subset of probable members , seems to confirm this distance to the ob association .",
    "on the other hand , when @xcite performed a recent proper motion study of the ic  348 region , they derived a distance of @xmath133  pc using a set of 9 hipparcos sources .",
    "this latter distance estimate to ic  348 should probably be treated with some caution . since more than half of these 9 sources with parallaxes were at projected distances of 2.5 - 8 pc from the cluster center , they fall well outside any cluster outer radius we have discussed here and may not be actual members , especially since no statistical estimate of the number of non - members was performed for the @xcite study .",
    "further , @xcite very recently reported the discovery of an f star within the ic  348 boundaries that displays rapid @xmath134 scuti - like variability that is interpreted as the pulsation of a pms star while in its instability strip @xcite .",
    "the derived pulsation period strongly favors a distance of @xmath135 to ic  348 .",
    "thus , it remains unclear if the distance to ic  348 can be separated from the distance to the ob association .",
    "for our modeling we adopted the distance of 320 pc ( m - m = 7.5 ) to ic  348 for consistency with the work of ll95 and @xcite , but we examined how such a distance uncertainty could affect our results .",
    "such distance uncertainties may systematically affect the derivation of cluster properties such as mean age and possibly the imf .",
    "@xcite , for example , showed that assigning ic  348 a closer distance yielded a systematically older cluster mean age since the cluster appears intrinsically fainter when compared to pre - main sequence evolutionary models . in figure",
    "[ fig : kml ] , we examine the net effect of this age - distance uncertainty on the theoretical mass - luminosity relations relevant for our luminosity function modeling . shifting the distance from 320 to 260pc produces a shift in the mean age from 2 to @xmath136 myr ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "however , the change in the distance modulus ( @xmath137 magnitudes ) is roughly equivalent to the average luminosity evolution of stars ( 1.0 - 0.1 @xmath12 ) between 2 and 3 myr ( @xmath138 ) . by comparing the mass-@xmath4 magnitude relation at 2 myr and 320pc to that at 3 myr and 260 pc ,",
    "we find that above the hydrogen burning limit , our derived imf will have little systematic dependence upon the cited age - distance uncertainty for ic  348 and should be a faithful representation of the true cluster imf . on the other hand ,",
    "the slope of the substellar mass-@xmath4 magnitude relation is systematically affected , in part due to a larger mass range undergoing deuterium burning .",
    "thus , our derived substellar imf will be less reliable than the stellar imf until this age - distance uncertainty is resolved .",
    "lastly , in figure [ fig : kml ] we also compare the theoretical mass - luminosity relations taken from two sets of evolutionary calculations . as we found in paper i , different theoretical mass-@xmath4 magnitude relations are very consistent between current sets of pms tracks , meaning that the derived imf will be mostly independent of which set of modern pms models we use . to provide consistency between our studies of various young clusters , we derived the cluster imf using our standard set of pms tracks , which are primarily based on the @xcite tracks and whose construction and conversion to observable quantities were described in @xcite",
    ".      three additional characteristics of young stars that we can include into our model luminosity function algorithm are the reddening of the cluster members by the parental molecular cloud , excess infrared flux due to optically thick disks around the cluster members , and the frequency of un - resolved companions .",
    "first , to account for the reddening of the cluster by the perseus molecular cloud , we used the extinction distribution functions derived in section [ sec : images : redden ] for the bright cluster stars de - reddened to the ctts locus .",
    "second , in section [ sec : images : results ] we confirmed the ll95 finding of @xmath139 infrared excess sources distributed across the ic  348 cluster region . correcting for field stars and dividing the excess sources by sub - region , we found infrared excess fractions of  @xmath140  for the core sub - region ,  @xmath141  for the cluster halo and  @xmath142 for the composite cluster .",
    "if we restrict these estimates to those 42 sources which have nir excess greater than their @xmath35 photometric errors , these percentages drop to @xmath143 , respectively .",
    "because these excess fractions are very small , we chose to no account for nir excess in our klf models of ic  348 .",
    "it is possible , however , that a more substantial fraction of sources could have small @xmath4 band excesses ( @xmath144 ) that are not apparent in the color - color diagram especially since @xcite found that @xmath145 of the ic  348 members have inner circumstellar disks as traced at @xmath146 .",
    "we argue such small excesses will not substantially affect the cluster klf and hence the derived cluster imf since this flux excess is much smaller than the bins used to create the cluster luminosity function .    finally , we choose not to include un - resolved binaries into our modeling of ic  348 , paralleling our analysis of the trapezium cluster in paper i. thus , the ic  348 imf we derive is the `` primary '' or `` single '' star imf .",
    "@xcite found that the binary fraction in ic  348 is very similar to that found in other young clusters and to the field .",
    "further , the consistency of the binary frequency in stellar clusters over a large range of cluster age @xcite , including young clusters like ic  348 , suggests that the single star imfs of star clusters can be readily derived and compared without correction for binaries .",
    "a related issue in our studies of different cluster imfs is whether or not a significant fraction of _ resolved _ wide binaries have been included into the cluster klfs .",
    "for example , the physical resolution of our trapezium study was @xmath147 au , while in ic  348 it is @xmath148 au .",
    "since the binary fraction at these large separations is quite small ( @xmath149 ) , the few resolved binary systems that will be included into these cluster klfs should not significantly modify the single star imfs we derive .      using these cluster parameters",
    ", we produced a suite of model luminosity functions by varying the underlying initial mass functions .",
    "our goal is to find the simplest underlying imf or range of imfs whose model luminosity functions best fit the observed cluster klf(s ) .",
    "our standard imf parameterization consists of power - law segments , @xmath150 , connected at break masses , @xmath151 , and we use the fewest segments necessary to fit the model klf , which for ic  348 resulted in 2 and 3 segment imfs .",
    "we independently calculated and fit model luminosity functions for both the composite cluster klf and the cluster s `` core '' and `` halo '' sub - region klfs , varying the extinction distribution function appropriately for each region .",
    "our fitting technique calculates the @xmath152  statistic and probability between the model klfs and observed klf over a range of magnitude bins and from these statistical measures , the parameters ( mean , standard deviation ) of the underlying imf are derived .",
    "we summarize these fits and the resulting imfs for the complete cluster in section [ sec : imf : model : clus ] , and for the two sub - regions in section [ sec : imf : model : corehalo ]      we examine the best fit model klfs to the complete cluster klf in the left hand panel of figure [ fig : klf_imf_clus ] .",
    "the composite cluster klf displays a very broad main peak followed by a sharp turnover at fainter magnitudes .",
    "this structure required the use of model klfs based upon a 3 power - law underlying imf , and we tabulate the derived imf parameters in table [ tab : imf : fits ] . by varying the range of klf bins fit by our @xmath74  routine , we find that with these 3 segment underlying imfs we were able to fit the composite cluster klf down to @xmath57 , constraining the cluster imf from @xmath153 down to @xmath154 ( for @xmath155 ) .",
    "non - power - law structure in the cluster klf for @xmath81 prevented decent fits to these bins ( see section [ sec : discuss : imf_klf : substar ] ) .    over this @xmath156 fit range",

    "the @xmath160 slope and the @xmath161 mass break are both strongly constrained by the broad klf peak and the sharp klf turnover at @xmath162 , with a very slowly rising @xmath163 across much of the imf before peaking at the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "because of the rapid change in klf slope between @xmath164 , there is a moderately large uncertainty in @xmath165 imf parameter with a sub - stellar imf slope that is very steeply falling with an index of @xmath166 .      in the left hand panels of figure [ fig : klf_imf_rad ] we display the sub - region differential klfs compared to the best fit model klfs derived from our @xmath152  fitting technique .",
    "the underlying power - law imfs are displayed in the right hand panels of this figure , and we list our derived imf parameters in table [ tab : imf : fits ] as a function of fit range .    unlike the more complex structure of the composite cluster klf , we found that model klfs constructed using 2 power - law imfs provided satisfactory fits to both sub - region klfs , although we were able to obtain slightly better fits to the `` halo '' klf using a 3 segment imf . for both sub - regions ,",
    "the @xmath167 mass break was very strongly constrained by the location of the bright klf peaks in the 2 power - law imf fits .",

    "our 3 power - law fits to the `` halo '' sub - region , we found a modest @xmath74  minima that indicated there is an inflection in this high mass slope near @xmath168 , yielding a @xmath157 similar to that found in the 2 segment `` core '' imf and to the composite cluster imf ( see table [ tab : imf : fits ] for comparison of 2 and 3 segment imfs for ic  348 ) . as evident in their klfs ,",
    "the two sub - regions have distinctly different imf peaks regardless of the complexity of the underlying imf , with the core @xmath167 mass break occurring at @xmath169 and the peak of the halo imf strongly constrained to lie at @xmath170 .",
    "below their peaks , both sub - region imfs steadily fall with decreasing mass down to the @xmath156 fit limit , which for both sub - regions corresponded to at least the @xmath57 bin and a minimum fit mass of @xmath171 .",
    "the @xmath160 slope was more tightly constrained for the two power - law `` core '' imf than for the halo , and we found that a single power - law imf with slope of @xmath172 could fit the core klf from the imf peak ( @xmath173 ) all the way down to the @xmath174 bin , which has a lower @xmath156  limit from the dm97 tracks of @xmath175 . similar to the composite cluster imf , the rapid change in halo klf slope between @xmath164 yielded considerable uncertainty in the corresponding imf parameter below the halo imf peak , but it was constrained to be steeply falling , with a @xmath176 . despite any limitations to our fitting procedure , we found that while the resulting substellar imf slopes are different in the two sub - regions ( @xmath176 versus @xmath177 ) , they correspond to similar proportions of brown dwarfs between the two regions , as we will discuss further in section [ sec : discuss : radimf ] .",
    "we examined the structure of the ic  348 klf and derived imf by comparing these characteristics to those we derived for the trapezium cluster in paper i. by comparing the paper i trapezium imf ( also reproduced in table [ tab : imf : fits ] ) to the derived ic  348 imf we find that these two very young clusters have nearly identical imfs throughout the stellar regime .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : klf_imf_clus ] , both clusters have imfs that rise in number with decreasing mass into the sub - solar regime , with salpeter - like power - law slopes ( @xmath178 and @xmath179 ) .",
    "their imfs both flatten around @xmath180 , having slopes of @xmath181 and form very broad shallow peaks at sub - solar masses .",
    "the `` peak '' or mode of their imfs varies between @xmath182 with a skewing of the mode of the ic  348 imf to slightly lower masses than the trapezium imf , although this may be due to the trapezium being only core of the larger orion nebula cluster ( see section [ sec : discuss : radimf ] ) .",
    "the strong similarities between these clusters stellar imfs exist despite the significant apparent differences between their cluster klfs . in figure",
    "[ fig : trap_ic348]a , we compare the trapezium and ic  348 klfs , shifting them by their respective distance moduli to absolute magnitudes and scaling the size of the trapezium population to match that of ic  348 .",
    "the ic  348 klf is clearly broader and shifted to fainter magnitudes relative to the trapezium klf with their primary klf peaks differing by almost 2 magnitudes .",
    "these differences , however , are precisely those predicted by the evolution of the luminosity function with age @xcite .",
    "indeed if we evolve a model klf of the younger trapezium to the age of ic  348 and compare it to the ic  348 klf in figure [ fig : trap_ic348]b , we find it agrees with the observed ic  348 klf extremely well down to @xmath183 , near the unreddened hydrogen burning limit for ic  348 ( @xmath184  myr , @xmath185 ) .. from various models we find for ic  348 that   @xmath186 ,   @xmath187 ,   @xmath188 ,  and   @xmath189 . for a mean age of 3 myr at a distance of 260 pc , @xmath190 . ]",
    "fainter than this magnitude the evolved trapezium klf moderately under - estimates the ic  348 klf between @xmath191 , indicative of the slight skewing of the mode of the derived ic  348 imf to lower masses . below @xmath162 ,",
    "both the observed ic  348 klf and the evolved trapezium klf steeply fall in number , marking the transition to the substellar regime that we explore in the next section .      reviewing figure(s ) [",
    "fig : klf_imf_clus]b and [ fig : trap_ic348 ] , one immediate similarity between the substellar klfs and imfs of ic  348 and the trapezium is their mutual steep decline towards fainter magnitudes and lower masses .",
    "although the ic  348 imf mode skews to lower masses than the trapezium , it turns over and decreases in a much steeper manner than the trapezium , i.e. , @xmath192 while @xmath193 .",
    "this is also illustrated by the way that the evolved trapezium klf seems to consistently over - estimate the number faint objects in ic  348 , although they agree within the large statistical uncertainties .",
    "a second similarity between the substellar klfs of ic  348 and the trapezium , is the formation of a modest secondary klf peak . after correction for background stars we estimate that in ic  348 this secondary klf peak contains @xmath194 sources between @xmath195 .",
    "further , the secondary klf peak for ic  348 occurs precisely in the magnitude range predicted by the evolved trapezium klf ( see figure [ fig : klf_imf_clus]b ) , suggesting they are related features and correspond to sources in the mass range from @xmath196 .",
    "as was the case for our trapezium modeling , such klf structure rejected our fitting of these magnitude bins using models based upon 3 segment power - law imfs .",
    "this is because we are trying to fit this non - power law klf structure ( a dip or gap followed by a secondary peak ) with model klfs that are essentially a power - law throughout the brown dwarf regime because the theoretical mass - luminosity relations that we have used are smooth and do not contain any significant evolutionary features in this mass range . considering the statistical uncertainties due to the background correction we did not attempt to explicitly fit additional imf segments to the ic  348 peak",
    "although the size of the predicted peak using the trapezium imf closely approximates this feature .",
    "we discuss the origin of this secondary klf peak further in section [ sec : discuss : mlr ] .",
    "one meaningful constraint regardless of detailed imf structure is the _ fraction _ of cluster members that are substellar .",
    "for example , in the trapezium we found that @xmath197 of the clusters members fell between @xmath198 , having the interesting implication that only @xmath199 of the cluster members were brown dwarfs ! estimating this fraction for ic  348 was more difficult because the background correction makes directly counting all the substellar sources difficult . rather than directly counting sources , we first integrated the derived imf to calculate the fraction of substellar sources down to the mass limit of our fit .",
    "we found that brown dwarfs between 80 and 25 @xmath114  ( the lower mass limit for @xmath200 and corresponding to our model fits to @xmath57 and the beginning of the secondary klf peak ) constitute only @xmath201 of the members with @xmath202 uncertainty due to the variation in our fits , and @xmath203 uncertainty due to the counting statistics which are dominated by the size of the background correction .",
    "for comparison , integrating the trapezium imf over the same mass range yields a brown dwarf fraction of @xmath204 .",
    "when we count the number of sources contained in the secondary peak of the ic  348 klf and not included into the klf fits , we were able to extend the range of substellar masses down to @xmath2 , however we also found that the precision of our estimate is significantly worsened by the large field star contamination . since this secondary klf peak contains between 26 and 42 sources depending upon the size of the correction for field stars , the total substellar fraction increased to @xmath205 for ic  348 , although the corresponding error bar also increased to @xmath206 .",
    "thus , despite the uncertainties due to the field star correction these fractions indicate that ic  348 has a very similar brown dwarf fraction to that found for the trapezium and further , that brown dwarfs are not nearly as populous as stars in either cluster .      as we derived in paper",
    "i , the secondary peak in the trapezium klf can be attributed to a corresponding imf peak near the deuterium burning limit .",
    "our finding of an ic  348 klf feature having a similar size and corresponding to the same mass range , @xmath207 , lends some support to this conclusion . one interesting implication of such structure in the cluster s substellar imf would be the existance of a separate formation mechanism for very low mass brown dwarfs , as we postulated in paper i. however , since the lf is the product of the imf and the slope of the mass - luminosity relation , it may also be the case that a subtle feature or inflection exists in the empirical mass - luminosity relation that has not been resolved by even the most recent theoretical models of brown dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such an unaccounted for m - l feature could also produce features in the lf independent of the structure of the underlying imf , as previously found , for example , in the @xcite studies of the @xmath208 and @xmath209 opacity features in the optical @xmath210 relation for field stars .",
    "there is very recent observational evidence that seems to point toward an unaccounted for m - l feature for brown dwarfs .",
    "@xcite discuss a feature in the color - magnitude diagram for the pleiades cluster , corresponding to an apparent gap in both color and luminosity space for substellar objects .",
    "@xcite draw an analogy between this feature and the @xmath211 opacity related wielen gap @xcite , attempt to correct the theoretical mass - luminosity relation for the effect of such a gap , and conclude that the lack of this feature in the theoretical tracks ( which they suggest is related to the formation of dust in the brown dwarf atmospheres ) is likely the cause of the imf structure we derived for the trapezium in paper i and that was also derived for the imf of the @xmath212-orionis cluster by @xcite .",
    "we point out that what we observe in the trapezium and ic  348 appear to be secondary peaks in the cluster klfs .",
    "drawing an analogy to studies of the @xmath213 opacity feature in the field star mass - luminosity relation @xcite or to the effects of deuterium burning on theoretical model klfs @xcite such a peak could be caused by a piling up of stars with a range of mass in a narrow range of luminosity .",
    "if we were to repeat the @xcite correction to the theoretical m - l relation but assume a more steeply falling slope for the substellar imf of the pleiades , such an inflection or piling up would be the result .",
    "regardless , it is uncertain which effect ( imf , m - l relation ) will in fact dominate the nature of the secondary klf peaks we have observed .",
    "clearly , improvements are needed in the theoretical tracks , which , in combination with future observations , should be able to disentangle these two effects for the substellar imfs of young clusters . however , which mechanism is producing this klf peak appears to operate only at the very lowest masses in the very young ( @xmath214 myr ) clusters we are studying .",
    "thus , it seems unlikely that it will modify the derived imf at the hydrogen burning limit and future updates probably will not adjust ( inflate or decrease ) the percentage of sources that are brown dwarfs in these clusters .",
    "our division of the cluster into two sub - regions based on the cluster s radial profile ( see section [ sec : images : radprof ] ) allowed us to make important comparisons to past studies of the ic  348 imf , which have primarily focused on the cluster s core .",
    "for example , when we compare in figure [ fig : radimf ] the imf we derived for around 150 sources in the ic  348 `` core '' to those mfs derived by ntc00 and @xcite each containing 90 - 100 sources , we find they agree remarkably well , all having an imf that peaks or has a mode between 0.3 and 0.5 @xmath12and turns over into the substellar regime . those differences that do exist between our `` core '' imf and these studies are likely due to the @xmath215 difference in sample sizes , which may produce statistical flucuations , or source saturation in the nicmos study , which causes it to exclude higher mass stars .",
    "such a strong similarity is not found , however , when we compare the imf of the cluster s core ( derived in this or past studies ) to that we derived for the cluster halo . paralleling the apparent physical differences in the klfs of the ic  348 sub - regions ( see figures [ fig : klfs ] and [ fig : cluslf ] ) , we find that the imf of the halo skews to lower masses relative to the imf of the cluster s core .",
    "this variation of the imf is a real representation of the differences in the two sub - regions and is not the product of a variation in some other physical quantity .",
    "reddening due to the molecular cloud and specific to each sub - region is included into these fits , although no meaningful differences exist between the relevant epdfs of the two regions ( see section [ sec : images : epdfs ] ) .",
    "although we did not include the effects of infrared excess , any such effect would actually _ increase _ the imf differences , since the larger excess fraction of the halo and would require the halo imf peak to shift to lower masses .",
    "further , the larger excess fraction in the halo might imply that the halo is younger than the core .",
    "however , accounting for such an age difference would again shift the imf peaks in _ opposite _ directions from one another and amplify the imf variations we derive .",
    "lastly , although it would seem to contradict the distribution of infrared excess and @xmath10  sources and was not corroborated by the study of @xcite , @xcite reported a slight age gradient in ic  348 , finding an increasing mean age at larger radii .",
    "such a gradient does act in the correct direction to account for some of the klf differences , however , even if this age gradient is real , it is considerably too small ( @xmath216 myr at @xmath217 to 2.8 myr at @xmath218 ) to bring the imfs of the sub - regions into agreement . to align the sub - region imf peaks given the observed",
    "klfs would require two distinct populations where the halo is 5 - 10 myr older than the core .",
    "this is an difficult hypothesis to accept considering the populations are of equal size , and while such a model might align the peak of the imfs by shifting the halo to higher masses , it would further imply that the imf of the halo is truncated below @xmath219 . as was originally found in the model",
    "fits of ll95 , we conclude that such a two age population model can not explain the ic  348 klfs . indeed , the one physical phenomena that we can not test here , the fact that the `` core '' sub - region contains `` halo '' members due to the two dimensional projection of the cluster , implies a priori that the spatial imf variation are _ larger _ than we derive since the `` halo '' imf contaminates the cluster `` core''(but not the reverse ) .",
    "since differences between the core and halo sub - region klfs can only be related to their underlying imfs and these imf differences ( as illustrated in figure [ fig : radimf ] ) appear statistically significant at the @xmath220 level , we conclude that a physical variation in the ic  348 imf appears to exist on spatial scales of the order of 1 parsec .",
    "further , these radial imf differences primarily occur in a limited range of sub - solar masses between 0.5 and 0.08 @xmath12 in ic  348 .",
    "this radial imf variation is unlike typical scenarios for mass segregation in very young clusters in which only the higher mass stars ( @xmath221 ) are thought to be preferentially affected . with these cluster(s ) being only a few crossing times old , there is thought to be only enough time for the massive stars to sink to the cluster core @xcite ; otherwise , these more massive stars are thought to be preferentially born in the cluster center through a process of competitive accretion @xcite .",
    "radial variations of a cluster s sub - solar imf have also been reported for the orion nebula cluster(onc ) , of which the trapezium is the core .",
    "while this cluster displays additional evidence for the segregation of high mass stars to the cluster core @xcite , the low mass onc imf varies between the central core and outer cluster halo .",
    "this has been shown by @xcite and @xcite who found that while the imf of the central @xmath222 trapezium core peaks around @xmath223 , the addition of the cluster s halo ( @xmath224 ) produces a composite onc imf that continues to rise down to @xmath225 , the completeness limit of the @xcite spectroscopic survey of the entire onc cluster .",
    "thus , this skewing of the stellar imf with radius proceeds in the same direction in the onc as we find in ic  348 , although ic  348 may in fact be a better location for studying such mass segregation .",
    "this is because the onc is projected along the same line of sight as the orion ic ob association , which may contaminate the derived cluster imf at large radii .",
    "what is clear in both clusters is that meaningful comparisons of their imfs can only be performed after composite imfs have been derived over large physical areas of the clusters ; smaller areas are subject to mass segregation effects even at very young ages .",
    "further , such effects must be taken into account when placing them into discussion of a `` universal '' imf ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "lastly , it is important to examine how the substellar sources are radially distributed . since dynamical effects that could produce the radial imf variation",
    "may operate on the lowest mass sources by skewing them to larger radii , brown dwarfs may correlate with the distribution of low mass , @xmath226 sources and be systematically located further from the cluster center . while the slope of the substellar imf varies significantly between the ic  348 core and halo , the percentage of sources that are substellar does not .",
    "we found that sources in the mass range from @xmath227 constitute roughly @xmath201 of the sources in the cluster core and a similar @xmath228 in the cluster halo ( poissonian error for both fractions is @xmath229 ) .",
    "this finding suggests that the mechanism that is breaking the universality of the imf on small spatial scales , whether it is primordial imf variations or dynamical mass segregation , does not appear to be significantly acting upon the substellar population .",
    "wide - field infrared imaging of other young clusters , such as , for example , a survey of the substellar population in the onc halo , will be necessary to determine if similar , uniform spatial distributions of brown dwarfs exist in other clusters that are still embedded in their parental molecular clouds .",
    "using wide - field near - infrared images provided by the flamingos camera on the kitt peak 2.1 m telescope , we performed a detailed census of the young 2 myr ic  348 cluster located on the northeastern end of the perseus molecular cloud . using the multi - color infrared photometry provided by our observations",
    ", we explored this cluster s structure , reddening , and relationship to the parental molecular cloud , and then used these results to construct and to analyze the ic  348 klf and to correct it for field star contamination . using our model luminosity function algorithm described in @xcite and @xcite , we derived the cluster s initial mass function , providing detailed fits and error estimates . from our analysis of the cluster s structure and luminosity function and by comparison to our earlier study of the trapezium cluster , we draw the following conclusions about the klf and imf of ic  348 :    1 .",
    "we derive an imf for the composite ic  348 cluster spanning the mass range from @xmath230 .",
    "further , we find that the ic  348 imf we derive is nearly identical to the the trapezium imf we derived in paper i : the two clusters imfs rise with decreasing mass , having a salpeter - like slopes before flattening below @xmath231 . within the current uncertainties in pms evolutionary models , we find that the mode of these star cluster imfs appear to fall at a mass of @xmath232 .",
    "further , we find that the relative size of the substellar population is very similar in both clusters within the uncertainties of our method , revealing that brown dwarfs constitute between @xmath233 of the members of either cluster and do not dominate the cluster s stellar populations .",
    "ic  348 forms a modest but significant secondary klf peak , corresponding to sources in the same mass range that we found responsible for a similar secondary klf peak in the trapezium .",
    "the similar klf features in the trapezium and ic  348 may signify either the presence of a secondary peak in the substellar imf between @xmath234  as we derived in paper i , or be the result of a previously unknown feature in the brown dwarf mass - luminosity relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "radial variations are found in the klf and imf of ic  348 on the parsec scale , with a skewing of the klf to fainter sources and the imf to lower mass stars in the cluster s halo , a portion of the cluster whose imf was previously undetermined .",
    "this radial variation in the sub - solar imf is similar to but more pronounced than what was found previously for the sub - solar mass stars in the orion nebula cluster .",
    "it is unclear what process is breaking the universality of the cluster s imf on small spatial scales , but it appears different from dynamical mass segregation which primarily acts upon higher mass stars at these young ages .",
    "further , while the slope of the substellar imf varies as a function of radius in ic  348 , the spatial distribution of brown dwarfs in this cluster is different from the stars and is uniformly distributed between the cluster s core and halo .    finally , we draw the general conclusion that the existence of radial variations of the imf on parsec scales even at very young ages ( 1 myr ) may mean that wide - field imaging surveys are a pre - requisite to making meaningful imf comparisons between different embedded clusters , a fact that has clearly been true in older open clusters for some time",
