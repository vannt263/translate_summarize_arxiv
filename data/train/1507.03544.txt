    "the excess free energy of a crystal in contact with a wall is an important quantity governing many interfacial phenomena such as wetting and heterogeneous nucleation  @xcite .",
    "theoretical approaches based on cell theory have been used to compute this quantity for model systems such as hard spheres  @xcite .",
    "atomistic simulation studies have also been carried out employing widely - used interaction potentials such as lennard - jones ( lj ) models and systems of hard spheres  @xcite .    in most previous studies ,",
    "the crystal is either in contact with a flat structureless wall  @xcite or a structured wall consisting of particles attached to sites corresponding to an ideal crystalline structure  @xcite . in both of these situations , the structure and energy of the crystalline layers in the neighborhood of the wall is not the same as in the bulk leading to an excess free energy as compared to the bulk .    an interesting situation arises when the energy and structure of the crystalline layers in contact with the wall remains the same as in the bulk .",
    "such a scenario occurs when the wall consists of particles frozen into positions occupied by the same crystalline phase at equilibrium . in this case",
    ", the wall is a frozen version of the same crystal .",
    "then , it is of interest from a fundamental statistical mechanical point of view , to determine the excess free energy of the system in comparison to the bulk .",
    "an analogous situation corresponding to a supercooled liquid in contact with a wall consisting of particles frozen into the same amorphous structure as the liquid has been widely studied in recent years in order to investigate the relaxation dynamics of glass - forming systems  @xcite .",
    "recently , an experimental investigation of such a system was carried out using colloidal particles  @xcite .",
    "such computational and experimental studies extract a growing length scale based on a slowing down of the dynamics near the wall and relate it to the slowing down of glassy dynamics in the bulk . in these investigations",
    ", it is implicitly assumed that the thermodynamics of the system is unperturbed by the wall if an average is carried out over the thermal fluctuations and different realizations of the wall  @xcite .",
    "however , in a recent work we obtained a non - zero interfacial free energy for a glass - forming binary lennard - jones liquid  @xcite in contact with a wall with the same amorphous structure as the supercooled liquid , indicating that thermodynamics of the liquid is affected by the presence of such a frozen wall  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we compute the excess free energy of a crystal in contact with a wall formed by its frozen version , using molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite in conjunction with thermodynamic integration  @xcite .",
    "we obtained a non - zero interfacial free energy for particles interacting via a lennard - jones potential  @xcite , which increases with increasing density of the crystal suggesting that the thermodynamics of the crystal in contact with such a wall is perturbed and not the same as in the bulk .",
    "moreover , at low densities @xmath0 is negative , indicating an increase of entropy as compared to the bulk . to test the robustness of our results and find out",
    "whether a negative value of @xmath0 is model - dependent or not , we carried out investigations with two other interaction potentials : a purely repulsive inverse - twelfth power soft - sphere potential and the hard sphere interaction ( using a @xmath1 potential )  @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath0 for the two purely repulsive interactions , while non - zero , is positive at all crystal densities .    in the next section",
    "we specify the interaction potentials considered in this work . in section  [",
    "sect : system_setup ] , the system is described and then we outline the thermodynamic integration scheme adopted to compute @xmath0 . in section  [",

    "the following interaction potentials are considered in this work :    \\(i ) a modified lennard - jones interaction potential ( mlj ) is chosen , defined by @xmath13 with @xmath14 , \\label{eq : lj}\\ ] ] for @xmath15 , and @xmath16 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",

    "the potential is truncated and shifted such that @xmath27 and its derivative with respect to @xmath28 goes to zero at @xmath29 .",

    "[ fig1 ] , we show the three interaction potentials as a function of the distance @xmath4 between the particles .",
    "our systems consist of face centered cubic ( fcc ) crystals of @xmath32 particles , with the ( 100 ) face oriented along the @xmath33 direction , enclosed in a simulation box of dimension @xmath34 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are maintained along the @xmath35 and @xmath36 directions . along the @xmath33 direction ,",
    "the particles are confined by several layers of the same crystalline particles frozen into their equilibrium configuration ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "since there are two wall - crystal interfaces , the total area of the interface is @xmath37 . in order to prevent any crystalline particle from penetrating the wall ,",
    "a short - ranged flat wall , modeled by a gaussian potential is inserted at the boundaries along the @xmath33 direction ( at @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) . as shown in our earlier works @xcite",
    ", such a short - ranged flat wall leads to a negligible contribution to the interfacial free energy ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the interfacial free energy is defined as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the free energy of the crystal confined by the frozen walls on both sides , while @xmath43 is the free - energy of the bulk crystal with periodic boundary conditions along all the three cartesian axes .",
    "our objective is to compute @xmath0 using molecular dynamics simulation and thermodynamic integration .",
    "the thermodynamic integration scheme adopted in this work is based on a similar approach devised by us in previous studies to compute the interfacial free energy of a liquid / crystal in contact with structured walls  @xcite and to determine the crystal - liquid interfacial free energy  @xcite .",
    "the goal is to transform a bulk crystal with periodic boundaries in all three cartesian - axes directions into a crystal in contact with frozen crystalline layers comprising the frozen walls on either side . to accomplish this",
    ", it is neccessary that the boundary conditions along the @xmath33 direction are rearranged at some point during the transformation and that the crystalline particles do not cross the boundaries during this rearrangement .",
    "hence , in the first step , two extremely short - ranged flat walls , modeled by a gaussian potential and denoted by @xmath44 , are gradually inserted at the boundaries of the simulation box at @xmath38 and @xmath45 with periodic boundary conditions maintained along all three axes .",
    "since the structureless flat wall has a very short range ( @xmath46 ) , few crystalline particles interact with it . as a result ,",
    "the contribution of this step to the total interfacial free energy is negligible and does not affect the structure of the crystal near the walls . to integrate the equations of motion in molecular dynamics in presence of such extremely short ranged walls , a very small time - step is needed .",
    "this reduces the computational efficiency since the other forces in the simulation such as those between the crystalline particles are more comparatively long - ranged ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "however , by the use of a multiple time - step scheme  @xcite , the computational overhead is reduced significantly and our simulations are slightly less than two times slower than those carried out with a single large time - step .    in the second step , interactions of particles through the periodic boundaries along the @xmath33 direction",
    "are gradually switched off while interactions between the crystal and the frozen crystalline wall are gradually switched on , in presence of the flat walls .",
    "the final state is a crystal with periodic boundaries along the @xmath35 and @xmath36 axes and confined by frozen crystalline walls and the flat walls along the @xmath33 direction .",

    "we have also observed that the energy profile of the crystalline layers near the wall is the same as in the bulk indicating that the wall particles do not change the structure and energy of the crystal layers in contact with it .",
    "if , instead , the wall is constituted by particles attached to ideal fcc lattice sites , the peaks of the density profiles near the wall are higher than those in layers away from the walls ( cf .",

    "[ fig4 ] shows , the thermodynamic integrands corresponding to the two relatively long - ranged interaction potentials are similar , while that of the short - ranged hard - sphere potential is qualitatively different .",

    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows a non - zero value for @xmath0 as a function of @xmath81 for all the three interaction potentials .",
    "the helmholtz free - energy @xmath88 is given by @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the energy of the system , @xmath91 the temperature and @xmath92 the entropy .",
    "since the potential energy of the system in contact with the wall is the same as in the bulk and the system is maintained at the same temperature throughout the thermodynamic transformation from the initial to the final states , a non - zero free - energy difference can only be attributed to a change in the entropy of the system .",
    "a non - zero free energy difference indicates that the frozen - in layer of crystalline particles imposes an external field on the crystalline particle , perturbing the thermodynamics as compared to the bulk .    for the purely repulsive inverse - twelfth power potential and the hard - sphere potential ,",
    "the interfacial free energy is always positive from the lowest to the highest densities considered . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , for @xmath93 , the inverse twelfth - power potential is more repulsive as compared to the hard sphere interaction , resulting in a larger interfacial free energy . the positive excess free energy corresponding to both the purely repulsive potentials at all densities and the modified lj potential at high densities originates due to a decrease of the entropy of the particles near the wall as they have less number of ways to arrange themselves near the wall and the thermal oscillations of the particles around their mean positions is also suppressed in the vicinity of the wall .",
    "in case of the modified lj potential , the interfacial free energy is positive only at high densities .",
    "as we go to lower and lower densities , @xmath0 decreases and eventually becomes negative .",
    "we have also computed the excess free energy for other interaction potentials and observed that this negative excess free energy occurs only for potentials with attractive interactions .",
    "a negative @xmath0 for the mlj potential at low densities indicates that the wall exerts an effective attractive pinning field on the free particles .",
    "since all the contribution to the change in free - energy comes from the change in entropy @xmath94 , a negative @xmath0 corresponds to @xmath95 , meaning that the entropy of the crystal in contact with a wall which is its frozen version , increases at low densities , if the interaction potential has an attractive component .",
    "as shown in a recent work  @xcite , this counterintuitive finding is similar to the case of a supercooled binary lj liquid in contact with an amorphous frozen wall having the same structure as the liquid , where a negative @xmath0 was obtained at low temperatures .",
    "in this work , we computed the excess free energy of a crystal in contact with a wall composed of several frozen - in layers of the same crystal , as a function of the density of the crystal .",
    "even though the structure and energy of the crystal in the vicinity of such a wall is the same as in the bulk a non - zero interfacial free energy is obtained , whose origin is purely entropic .",
    "a non - zero interfacial free energy indicates that the wall effectively imposes an external field on the bulk system and thereby the thermodynamics of the system is altered .    for purely repulsive interaction potentials , the excess free energy is always positive indicating that entropy of the crystal in contact with the wall is less than that of a bulk crystal .",
    "however , for a modified lj potential , which has an attractive component , the interfacial free energy is negative at low densities , indicating that entropy of the system in contact with the wall is larger than that of the bulk crystal .",
