    "the theoretical prediction and experimental demonstration of the possibility of conduction through single molecules attached to metallic leads @xcite , has triggered the interest about the factors that affect the electron transmission and the feasibility to control them @xcite .",
    "it is expected not only to scale down the electronic devices to smaller sizes , but also to provide them with new functionalities based on the quantum nature of the system @xcite . in particular , the possibility of controling quantum interference has raised a great deal of interest from both a theoretical and experimental point of view @xcite .",
    "for instance , it has been pointed out the possibility of controling magnetically the transmission through molecular rings , such as aromatic molecules , taking advantage of the condition of quantum interference @xcite .",
    "another way of affecting the quantum transmission could be by the direct modulation of transport current through a molecule junction by an external gate voltage @xcite .",
    "such a three - terminal molecule - scale device allows for the direct modification of the orbital energy .",
    "the physically interesting , although currently hypothetical , possibility of applying a local gate potential on one or more atoms in the molecule , would allow one to tune the molecular electronic structure in a similar way as the introduction of a substituent or side group does , although now in a continuously controlled way .",
    "the standard first - principle theoretical description of the transmission through single molecule junctions is based on non equilibrium green function ( negf ) techniques in conjunction with density functional theory ( dft ) based electronic structure .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown that more approximate descriptions , such as hartree - fock or tight binding methods , also provide a qualitative and even reasonably quantitative description of the phenomena .",
    "tight binding models are specially appealing , due to their simplicity , for providing insight into the most relevant physical mechanisms of the transmission as well as for using them as simple predicting tools for guiding either experiments or more precise theoretical methods . in line with this , a number of methods have been proposed to discuss the relation between the electronic or molecular structure to the transmission properties of the molecular devices @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study the quantum transmission through a molecular junction whose on - site energies can be continuously tuned by a local potential . as usual and for brevity , we shall refer here to such a potential as a gate potential .",
    "although gating a single atom is currently only a hypothetical possibility , its theoretical analysis illustrates the physical principles underlying those effects .",
    "firstly , we summarize the analytical properties of the transmission function in terms of the electronic structure and describe the two types of zeroes of resonance",
    ". then , we use a tight binding model , to translate the analytical conditions on the green function of the isolated molecule into graphical rules based on the molecular orbital plots .",
    "this graphical interpretation allows one to infer the complete spectrum of transmission , for an arbitrary connection , from a direct inspection of the molecular orbitals .",
    "finally , we discuss how the application of a local potential at one or more atomic sites of the benzene molecule , gives rise to changes in the electronic structure which , in due course , modulates the quantum transmission through the molecule .",
    "consider that the atoms @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the molecule are connected to the sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 at the left and right leads by hopping parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . applying dyson equation ,",
    "the green function @xmath7 of the coupled system can be obtained in terms of the green functions of the isolated leads @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and those of the isolated molecule @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the self - energy , and symmetric coupling to identical leads is assumed . within the wide band approximation , @xmath15 is assumed to be purely imaginary and energy - independent , with @xmath16 giving the broadening of the molecular levels , such that @xmath17 from which the transmission @xmath18 can be obtained : @xmath19    in approximate treatments of the electronic structure of molecules , like in the tight - binding ( hckel ) model , the charge transport results from a competition between the on - site energy @xmath20 that tends to localize the electron in the atom positions , and the hopping energy @xmath21 that favours the motion from an atom to its nearest neighbour . as a result ,",
    "the spectrum of transmission for a weakly coupled molecule ( @xmath22 ) typically consists of narrow peaks of high ( eventually perfect ) conductance and narrower antiresonances (",
    "i.e. , complete suppression of transmission ) or dips at a discrete set of energy values , on top of a background of a smooth transmission function .",
    "this background has an approximately constant order of magnitude within an energy range , decreasing with a power - law of the energy out of it .",
    "the origin of this smooth transmission function can be understood by neglecting the details of the molecular structure .",
    "then , the molecule is characterized by a set of energy eigenvalues , roughly in the range @xmath23 , where the green function behaves approximately as @xmath24 , so the transmission becomes @xmath25 .",
    "it will be shown below that the peaks and dips reflect the details of the molecular junction , i.e. , both the electronic structure of the molecule as well as the topology of the connection .",
    "( [ connected g1n ] ) and ( [ transmission ] ) shows that the transmission through the connected molecule depends on the electronic structure of the isolated molecule both through the diagonal green functions ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) at the connecting sites as well as through the off - diagonal function @xmath12 between them .",
    "the choice of the pair @xmath26 corresponds to the dependence on the topology of the connection .",
    "+      consider an energy eigenvalue @xmath27 of the disconnected molecule corresponding to the molecular orbital @xmath28 , which is written as a linear combination of the orbitals @xmath29 centered at the atoms , @xmath30 , with @xmath31 . due to the spectral representation of the green function , the poles of @xmath32 are a set of ( eventually all ) the energy eigenvalues @xmath27 .",
    "it has been shown that , for non degenerate @xmath27 , the poles of @xmath12 are also poles of @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this entails that the green function of the connected molecule , eq .",
    "( [ connected g1n ] ) , can be approximated near the pole @xmath33 as @xmath34 where @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) is the corresponding residue of @xmath37 , which shows that the transmission has a pole at @xmath38 and a finite transmission @xmath39 at @xmath33 .",
    "the level @xmath27 acquires a finite width proportional to the coupling to the leads @xmath16 . in the particular case where the sites @xmath1 and @xmath2 are topologically equivalent because of the symmetry of the system , @xmath40 , a perfect transmission occurs .    on the other hand , if @xmath33 is a pole of @xmath10 or @xmath11 , but not of @xmath12 , the numerator @xmath41 of eq .",
    "( [ connected g1n ] ) is finite whilst its denominator diverges ; therefore @xmath18 will show an antiresonance at @xmath33 .",
    "finally , the condition for the energy eigenvalue @xmath27 to be a pole of @xmath12 can be related to the corresponding eigenstate @xmath42 of the isolated system : @xmath27 will become a pole of @xmath12 if @xmath42 have non - vanishing projection on the orbitals @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , we can summarize the relation between the transmission and the electronic structure as follows : _ the transmission coefficient @xmath0 will show a peak of transmission , an antiresonance or a regular transmission @xmath45 at the molecular energy @xmath27 if the molecular orbital @xmath42 has a non - vanishing weight at both , only one or none of the connecting sites , respectively . _",
    "+    the case when the eigenvalue @xmath27 is degenerate requires some further consideration .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , consider a two - fold degenerate level @xmath27 with eigenfunctions @xmath46 , ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the spectral representation of the green function now reads @xmath48 the property @xmath49 , valid for the non - degenerate case , does no longer hold here .",
    "instead @xmath50 which can vanish or not depending on the @xmath51 and @xmath52 . if @xmath53 , all above discussion holds ; if not , the transmission becomes suppressed ( @xmath54 ) @xcite .",
    "+ the antiresonances discussed above occur at the energy eigenvalues of the molecule and , consequently , they were named as _ resonant zeroes _ of transmission . nevertheless , eq . ( [ connected g1n ] )",
    ", shows that also the roots of @xmath12 can lead to zeroes of conductance , that were termed _ multipath zeroes _ @xcite . to explore their origin ,",
    "we employ a tight binding hamiltonian together with a partitioning consisting in dividing the basis of orbitals centered at the sites in the @xmath55-subspace ( @xmath56 ) and the @xmath57-subspace , formed by the rest of the orbitals centered at non - connecting sites .",
    "the green function of the isolated molecule can be written as the resolvent @xmath58 of an effective @xmath59 hamiltonian in the @xmath55-space , in terms of the self - energy @xmath60 as @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "the energy - dependent diagonal and off - diagonal elements of the self - energy are interpreted here as effective on - site energies and effective hoppings between the sites @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "now assume that sites @xmath1 and @xmath2 are coupled to the rest of the molecule through sites @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , as shown in fig . 1 , through identical hoppings",

    "the leads are attached to sites @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which are connected to the rest of the molecule through atoms @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the green function @xmath12 results from hoppings @xmath21 from @xmath1 to the @xmath57-space , a sum of contributions @xmath67 along pathways ( a , b and c ) within the @xmath57-space , and hoppings @xmath21 from the @xmath57-space to the atom @xmath2 .",

    "this gives @xmath12 as a sum of four terms that can be interpreted as the pathways a ( above ) , b ( below ) and c ( cross ) shown in fig . 1 , and the green function has the form @xmath72    when the molecule has two paths disconnected from each other , i.e. , two sets of disjoint sites , as in a cyclic molecule , the green function in the @xmath57-space becomes blocked @xmath73 so that , @xmath74 , and there are only two contributing pathways a ( @xmath75 ) and b ( @xmath76 ) : @xmath77 then , a zero of transmission coming from @xmath78 can be attributed to a cancellation of the two contributions , one from each path : @xmath79 .      from the spectral representation",
    "it can be seen that near a pole @xmath80 the green function behaves like @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and , therefore , for @xmath83 , its behaviour is well represented by @xmath84 which is schematically depicted in figs .",

    "( c ) plot of a typical molecular orbital ( mo ) : nodal ( dashed ) lines in the plane of the molecule separate darker and lighter regions of positive and negative sign of the wave function ; the closer an atom to the nodal line , the smaller its coefficient in the mo expansion in terms of atomic orbitals .",
    "pairs of atoms placed in regions of opposite sign ( e.g. , atoms a and b ) give negative residues while those in regions of the same sign ( e.g. , a and c ) give positive residues in the corresponding green functions at the energy of the mo .",
    "furthermore , @xmath92 because atom ` a ' is close to a nodal line . ]",
    "when both residues have the same sign , say positive , @xmath93 changes its sign from @xmath94 to @xmath95 , thus showing that there exists a root in the range @xmath96 which in due turn produces a zero of resonance at a weighted average of @xmath80 and @xmath97 @xmath98 it should be noted that @xmath80 is weighted by the residue at @xmath97 such that the larger the residue is at @xmath97 , the closer is the root to @xmath99 .",
    "this could be pictorially described as a repulsion of the root by two successive poles that enclose it and having residues of the same sign .",
    "on the other hand , if both residues have opposite signs , @xmath100 becomes definite positive in the range @xmath96 and no zero occurs .",
    "rather rarely , the approximation ( [ approx green ] ) might not be accurate enough , because other poles make non negligible contributions , so that the curve cuts the @xmath101-axis twice and two antiresonances occurs .",
    "now we shall show that the general form of the transmission spectra can be obtained from a graphical interpretation of the properties derived in section [ properties ] from the plots of the molecular orbitals .",
    "typical plots show regions of different signs ( shown as darker and lighter zones ) separated by nodal lines resulting from the intersection between nodal surfaces with the plane of the molecule ( see fig .",

    "( _ iii _ ) due to @xmath42 is normalized , the proximity of the atom @xmath1 or @xmath2 to a nodal line entails that the coefficient is small , and so is the residue at @xmath33 .",
    "+ the molecular orbital plots can also be directly related to the transmission spectra as follows :    \\(i ) in the transmission spectrum , there are peaks and antiresonances at the molecular eigenvalues @xmath27 .",
    "the peaks occurs at those values @xmath27 whose corresponding molecular orbital has no nodal line passing through the connection sites , the antiresonances when it does .",

    "( [ root position ] ) .",
    "\\(iii ) the closer the atom @xmath1 or @xmath2 is to a nodal line , the smaller the transmission for the connection @xmath26 .",
    "the simple rules stated above allows us to explain the calculated transmission spectra shown in the next section .",
    "as an example of the analysis given in the previous section , we calculated the transmission through benzene in its _ ortho_- , _ meta_- and _ para_-connections to the leads .",
    "3 shows the scheme of the molecular orbitals for benzene ( disconnected from the leads ) with a gate voltage of 0.5 ev applied on atom 5 , _",
    "i.e. _ , in the later case , the on - site energy @xmath106 is shifted to @xmath107 ev while the rest of the atoms are kept at @xmath108 ev .",
    "the hopping parameter is @xmath109 ev , and the coupling to the leads @xmath110 ev .",
    "the application of the gate potential produces small changes in the energy eigenvalues with respect to the ungated molecule .",
    "nevertheless , two qualitatively different features occur , namely , the breaking of the degeneracy of states @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and the change in the symmetry of the corresponding orbitals .",
    "the lowest and the highest energy orbitals are only slightly modified and keep their symmetry . for both , gated and ungated benzene ,",
    "the first orbital have a single sign in all the plane while the highest energy orbital alternates its sign from one atom to the adjacent one .",

    "the dashed blue lines are the transmission through ungated benzene for comparison .",
    "the horizontal dotted black lines are the order of magnitude estimates @xmath113 . ]    from application of the above stated graphical rules , the effect of the relative positions of gate and leads can be anticipated .",
    "firstly , we consider the transmission spectra of benzene with a gate at atom 5 .",
    "the left lead is connected at atom @xmath114 , while the right lead is attached to atom @xmath2 , where @xmath115 , 3 and 4 for the _ ortho _ , _ meta _ and _ para _ connections , respectively .",
    "3a shows plots of molecular orbitals for this case . for none of them",
    "any nodal line passes through atoms 1 , 3 nor 4 .",
    "therefore , at the energy eigenvalues there are peaks of transmission in the _ meta _ and _ para _ connections . for the _",
    "ortho _ connection , however , there are zeroes of transmission at @xmath91 and @xmath116 because a nodal line passes through atom 2 in the plot of the molecular orbitals corresponding to those energies .",
    "the other two antiresonances are multipath zeroes in the intervals @xmath117 and @xmath118 , that are due to the fact that the atoms 1 and 2 have residues of the same sign at two consecutive poles of the green function . in the plots ,",
    "this is seen as due to the fact that the atoms 1 and 2 both occupy regions of opposite signs in the two consecutive orbitals @xmath119 and @xmath120 .    on the other hand , atoms 1 and 3 occupy regions of the same sign , thus giving positive residue , in the orbitals @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "therefore an antiresonance is expected for the _ meta _ connection ( with the gate applied at atom 5 ) in the interval @xmath118 .    finally , atoms 1 and 4 occupy regions of the same sign for the orbitals @xmath121 , @xmath123 and @xmath119 ; as a consequence an antiresonance in the transmission function of the _ para_-connection arises in the interval @xmath112 , since both energies are poles with residues of the positive sign .",
    "a similar analysis shows that @xmath89 and @xmath124 are poles having both negative residues , thus giving an antiresonance in the interval @xmath111 .",
    "4b shows the comparison for a fixed connection ( _ meta _ between atoms 1 and 3 ) of the effect of the gate position .",
    "the transmission functions for a gate applied on atoms 4 and 5 are shown with dashed blue line and solid red line , respectively .",
    "the most remarkable change is that the peak of transmission at @xmath91 and @xmath116 , when the gate is applied on atom 4 , turns into an antiresonance when the gate is applied on atom 5 .",
    "the reason can be traced back to the green function ( depicted in fig .",
    "4c ) , which shows that @xmath125 diverges at @xmath91 for the gate at 5 , while remains finite for the gate at 4 .",
    "nevertheless , a simpler justification can be argued based on the molecular orbital plots . as seen in fig .",
    "4a , both sets of orbitals only differ in a 60 degrees rotation between each other .",
    "then , the nodal line passing through atom 1 at @xmath91 and @xmath116 when the gate is on site 4 , transforms into a nodal line passing through atom 2 when the gate is on site 5 .",
    "then , for the 1,3-_meta_- connection , the former has a vanishing weight at one of the connecting atoms ( atom 1 ) , while the latter does not .",
    "interestingly , such a change in the relative position of gate and connecting sites , entails a change from perfect to null transmission at a given energy .",
    "+ in order to get a deeper insight of the cancellation of the transmission due to interference of pathways , consider benzene connected to the leads in the _ meta _ configuration with @xmath114 , @xmath126 , and the gate potential applied to atom 4 or 5 .",
    "the self - energy @xmath127 becomes the sum of two contributions [ eq . ( [ 2 pathways ] ) ] @xmath128 one through the single site 2 with @xmath129 , and another through a three - atoms chain ( @xmath130 ) having an on - site energy @xmath131 at its end ( gate applied on site 4 ) or in the central site ( gate applied at 5 ) .",

    "when the gate is applied on site 4 , at the energy @xmath134 , the contributions @xmath135 , cancels each other exactly , thus giving @xmath136 and therefore , an antiresonance in the transmission occurs at the energy of the gate potential .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the gate potential is applied at site 5 , both @xmath137 and @xmath138 diverge at @xmath139 , and so does @xmath140 .",
    "nevertheless , for this analytically solvable case , it can be explicitly shown that for arbitrary on - site energies @xmath141 and @xmath106 , the self - energy is proportional to @xmath142 $ ] .",
    "therefore , when the gate is appled on site 5 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 , the antiresonances occur at @xmath139 and @xmath145 , which correspond to the zeroes at -8.85 ev and -3.85 ev . + consider now _ para_-connected benzene : @xmath114 , @xmath146 ; in this case , @xmath147 .",
    "if all on - site energies @xmath20 are the same , @xmath148 and there is constructive interference .",

    "it should be noted that no antiresonance occur in the interval @xmath160 , roughly corresponding to the absence of zeroes of transmission within the homo - lumo gap in the _ para_-connection .",
