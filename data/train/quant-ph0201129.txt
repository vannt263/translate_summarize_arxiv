    "the process of quantizing a classical system has been of interest since the early days of quantum mechanics and remains an active field of research .",
    "the most sophisticated quantization procedure is provided by _ geometric quantization _",
    "this procedure , founded on kirillov s so - called _ orbit method _ @xcite , was inititated by kostant  @xcite , and souriau  @xcite , who extended the orbit method by capitalizing on the physical insights that come from its applications to quantum mechanics .",
    "thus geometric quantization incorporates ideas that physicists have used for many years , but provides new avenues to address quantization of more difficult systems .",
    "our primary concern in this paper is the significance of gq for the representation theory of lie groups and lie algebras .",
    "its relevance to representation theory is based on the observation that quantizing a model with an sga ( spectrum generating algebra ) , defined in the following section , is equivalent to constructing an appropriate irreducible unitary representation of that algebra  @xcite .",
    "conversely , as brought to light by gq , the construction of a unitary irrep of a lie group or algebra is often equivalent to quantizing some classical hamiltonian system .",
    "thus , the theory of induced representations plays a central role in the quantization of a model and in quantum mechanics in general , as emphasized by mackey  @xcite .",
    "establishing an explicit correspondence between induced representation theory and gq sheds new light on both theories .",
    "the theory of induced representations is viewed in this paper from the perspective of coherent state theory  @xcite , which incorporates other inducing constructions in terms of structures and concepts that relate naturally to quantum mechanics and gq . it is shown that coherent state theory reproduces three categories of representations of the sga for an algebraic model , and that these categories are related to structures in geometric quantization .",
    "first , there are classical realizations of the sga as functions on a phase space ; gq begins with such a classical realization .",
    "the coherent state construction also yields the induced unitary ( reducible ) representations that correspond to prequantization .",
    "finally , the unitary irreducible representations , corresponding to full quantization , are obtained through means related to the choice of a polarization in gq .",
    "these techniques are illustrated by a variety of examples .",
    "a relationship between cohererent state theory and geometric quantization follows naturally from the problem that gave rise to coherent state representations ; namely , `` construct an irrreducible unitary representation of a group from the properties of a set of coherent states ''  @xcite . as will be shown in the following ,",
    "the expectation values of the lie algebra over a set of coherent states give a classical representation of the lie algebra .",
    "thus , regaining a unitary irrep is equivalent to quantization of this classical representation .",
    "it is found that reconstructing the irrep is possible in coherent state theory only for particular orbits which give rise to the classical representations that are described as _",
    "quantizable _ in geometric quantization .",
    "it is the principal aim of this paper to show that coherent state methods provide an intuitive and practical framework for implementing the procedures of induced representations and geometric quantization .",
    "we thereby attempt to make these fundamental theories accessible to a wider community .",
    "the illustrative examples presented here are intentionally simple .",
    "however , it is noted that all three theories have been deployed in non - trivial ways .",
    "the theory of induced representations has made seminal contributions in physics , e.g. , to the representation theory of the poincar group @xcite and the space groups of crystals @xcite ; indeed , it is central to representation theory and quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "geometric quantization leads to a deep understanding of the route from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics .",
    "it has been used , for example , to develop theories of quantized vortices in hydrodynamics @xcite and nuclei @xcite and to reproduce the irreducible unitary representations of compact lie groups and the holomorphic discrete series of reductive lie groups @xcite .",
    "other applications can be found in the book of guillemin and sternberg @xcite .",
    "similarly , coherent state theory has provided a fundamental understanding of classical - like behaviour in quantum mechanics , e.g. , in the field of quantum optics @xcite .",
    "it has also been used extensively  @xcite , particularly in its vector coherent state extension  @xcite ( outlined in the following paper ) , in the quantization of numerous physical models by explicit construction of the irreducible representations of their spectrum generating algebras ( cf . ,",
    "@xcite for a long list of references ) .",
    "our hope is that the complementary aspects of these powerful methods will result in their successful application to even more challenging problems .",
    "it has long been known @xcite that there is a close relationship between the theories of coherent states , induced representations and geometric quantization .",
    "indeed , the kirillov method @xcite , from which geometric quantization emerged , was expressed as an inducing construction .",
    "this relationship was used , for example , by streater @xcite to construct the irreducible unitary representations of the semidirect product oscillator group , following both mackey and kirillov methods , and by dunne @xcite to construct the irreps of @xmath0 .",
    "it is particularly well known that the coadjoints orbits of a lie group play central roles in all three theories ( cf .",
    ", for example , chapter 15 of kirillov s book @xcite ) .",
    "the contribution of this paper is to explore the detailed relationships between the theories so that their complementary strengths may be better understood and more readily applied to problems in physics .",
    "moreover , by establishing detailed relationships , we hope to make it easier to move between the different expressions of quantization and induced representations in the solution of complex problems .    with a relationship between scalar coherent state theory and gq in place , the generalization to vector coherent state theory  @xcite , in which irreps of an algebra are induced from multidimensional irreps of a subalgebra ,",
    "indicates new ways of applying geometric quantization to models with intrinsic degrees of freedom .",
    "conversely , the different perspective of geometric quantization suggests possibilities for generalization of the theory of induced representations .",
    "these issues will be discussed in the sequel paper .",
    "an algebraic model is defined below as a model with an sga .",
    "the quantization of an algebraic model and the construction of the irreducible unitary representations of its sga are then related problems . however , whereas quantization starts with the classical hamiltonian dynamics on a phase space , the theory of induced representations starts with the abstract sga . these and other concepts invoked in the two constructions are reviewed in this section .      in classical mechanics ,",
    "observables are realized as smooth real - valued functions on a connected phase space @xmath1 , i.e. , elements of @xmath2 .",
    "they form an infinite - dimensional lie algebra with lie product given by a poisson bracket . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "observables are interpreted as hermitian linear operators on a hilbert space @xmath3 ; they are elements of @xmath4 and form an infinite - dimensional lie algebra with lie product given by commutation .",
    "the algebras @xmath2 and @xmath4 for a given physical system are different @xcite . however",
    ", a simple relationship may be established between finite - dimensional subalgebras of @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "thus , it is convenient to consider an abstract lie algebra of observables @xmath5 that is real and finite - dimensional and can be represented classically by a homomorphism @xmath6 and quantum mechanically by a unitary representation @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote classical and quantal representations , respectively , of an element @xmath10 .",

    "( more precisely , the classical homomorphism is given by @xmath18 , so that @xmath19 . )",
    "let @xmath20 denote the classical algebra @xmath21 .",
    "we shall describe the algebra @xmath22 ( and hence the algebra @xmath5 ) as a _ spectrum generating algebra _ for the classical system if the values of the observables in @xmath22 are sufficient to uniquely specify a point in @xmath1 and their gradients span the tangent space of @xmath1 at every point .",
    "( other compatible definitions of a sga can be found in the literature  @xcite .",
    "for example , a classical sga can be defined by requiring that the only functions in @xmath2 that poisson commute with all elements of @xmath22 are the constant functions  @xcite . )",
    "a finite - dimensional lie algebra @xmath5 is said to be a sga for a quantal system if the hilbert space for the system carries an irreducible representation of @xmath5 .",
    "however , to be useful , one may require also that the hamiltonian and other important observables of the system should be simply expressible in terms of @xmath5 , e.g. , by belonging to its universal enveloping algebra .",
    "thus , in quantizing a classical model , we shall seek a quantal system with the same sga as the classical model .",
    "a model dynamical system that has a finite - dimensional sga is said to be an _",
    "algebraic model_.      let @xmath23 be a group of canonical transformations ( i.e. , symplectomorphisms ) of a classical phase space @xmath1 for a model .",
    "then , if @xmath23 acts transitively on @xmath1 , it is said to be a _ dynamical group _ for the model .",
    "if an element @xmath24 sends a point @xmath25 to @xmath26 , then @xmath1 is the group orbit @xmath27 and diffeomorphic to the factor space @xmath28 with isotropy subgroup @xmath29 a remarkable fact  @xcite that will be used extensively in the following is that a phase space with a dynamical group can be identified with a coadjoint orbit .",
    "conversely , every coadjoint orbit is a phase space .",
    "moreover , the lie algebra @xmath5 of @xmath23 is a sga for the model .",
    "note that in quantum mechanics , one is often interested in projective representations of a given dynamical group .",
    "thus , we consider projective as well as true representations ; in practice , it is often simpler to choose a dynamical group that is simply connected so that all its representations are true representations .    recall  @xcite that @xmath23 has a natural adjoint action on its lie algebra @xmath5 @xmath30 where , for a matrix group , @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath23 also has a coadjoint action on the space @xmath32 of real - valued linear functionals on @xmath5 ( the dual of @xmath5 ) .",
    "the action of an element @xmath33 on an element @xmath10 is given by the natural pairing of @xmath5 and @xmath32 , expressed as @xmath34 for matrices .",
    "the coadjoint action is then defined , for @xmath35 and @xmath24 , by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 thus , the coadjoint orbit @xmath38 is diffeomorphic to the factor space @xmath39 with isotropy subgroup @xmath40 .",
    "we shall refer to an element @xmath41 of @xmath32 as a _",

    "this map is known as a _ moment map _",
    "@xcite .",
    "such a moment map defines a classical representation @xmath46 of the lie algebra @xmath5 as functions over the classical phase space @xmath1 , defined by @xmath47 with poisson bracket given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the antisymmetric two - form as a set of invariant vector fields on @xmath1 , @xmath49 becomes a two - form on @xmath1 . ] with values at @xmath50 given by @xmath51 )    \\,,\\quad \\forall\\ , a , b\\in \\mathfrak{g}\\,.\\ ] ] thus , the moment map @xmath52 defines a symplectic form @xmath49 on @xmath53 .",
    "this form is known to be nondegenerate and the map @xmath54 is a symplectomorphism .",
    "geometric quantization formalizes the ideas of dirac  @xcite concerning the quantization of a classical system .",
    "the idea is to replace the classical ( poisson bracket ) algebra of functions on a phase space by a unitary representation ; i.e. , map each classical observable ( function ) @xmath55 to a hermitian operator @xmath56 such that , if @xmath57 then @xmath58 = \\rmi\\hbar \\ , \\hat{f}_3 \\ , .\\ ] ] there are some additional requirements of the _ dirac map .",
    "_ first , all constant functions must map to multiples of the identity operator @xmath59 .",
    "second , the unitary representation should be irreducible .",
    "gq solves the first part of the dirac problem by a construction known as prequantization .",
    "however , it is now known that there are generally no irreducible unitary representations of the full algebra of observables  @xcite .",
    "thus , a complete solution of the dirac problem is impossible .",
    "when there exists a finite - dimensional sga for the model then , under certain quantizability conditions , the restriction to the sga of the representation given by prequantization becomes fully reducible .",
    "moreover , gq gives a prescription for the reduction in terms of a _",
    "polarization_. for details of the techniques of gq , see woodhouse  @xcite .",
    "it will be shown in the following that the reducible representation of a sga given by prequantization of a classical phase space diffeomorphic to @xmath60 integrates to the reducible representation of @xmath23 induced from a one - dimensional representation of @xmath61 in the standard theory of induced representations . likewise",
    ", the irreducible representations obtained by introducing a polarization are obtainable by the coherent state inducing construction .",
    "in this section , we show how the coherent state construction reproduces the three categories of representations of the sga of an algebraic model : classical realizations , reducible unitary representations corresponding to prequantization , and irreducible unitary representations of a full quantization .",
    "let @xmath23 with lie algebra @xmath5 denote the dynamical group of an algebraic model and let @xmath62 denote an abstract ( possibly projective ) unitary representation of @xmath23 on a hilbert space @xmath3 .",
    "there is no need to make a precise specification of @xmath62 .",
    "for example , if @xmath23 has a right invariant measure @xmath63 , @xmath3 could be the space @xmath64 of square integrable functions with respect to this measure and @xmath62 the regular representation . or",
    ", for application to models of many - particle systems , @xmath3 might be the standard many - particle hilbert space @xmath65 of square - integrable functions of many - particle cartesian coordinates and @xmath62 a weil  @xcite or schrdinger representation ( see section  [ subsubsec : schrodinger ] ) .    for notational convenience",
    "we denote the representation @xmath66 of an element @xmath67 by @xmath68 .",
    "in section  [ sect : coadorbits ] , the classical phase space for an algebraic model is shown to be expressible as a coadjoint orbit . in this section ,",
    "we show that these coadjoint orbits can be projected from group orbits in the hilbert space .    for any state @xmath69 of unit norm (",
    "i.e. , @xmath70 ) there is a system of coherent states  @xcite @xmath71 and a corresponding set of dual states @xmath72 moreover , there is a natural identification of any state with a density , i.e. , an element of the dual algebra @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the coherent states define a system of densities @xmath73 where @xmath74 it follows that the coherent states determine a coadjoint orbit @xmath75 they also determine a map @xmath76 from the lie algebra @xmath5 ( cf .",

    "it will be noted that the above results are expressed in terms of a specific choice of the basis elements @xmath103 of the lie algebra .",
    "thus , it is important to ask if the results depend on the choice .",
    "two distinct kinds of transformation of the basis are possible : @xmath104 and @xmath105 combinations of the two kinds are also possible but it is instructive to consider them separately .",
    "transformations of the first kind leave the subspace of the lie algebra spanned by the elements @xmath103 invariant .",
    "they generate normal coordinate transformations on @xmath53 . however , all physical expressions , like the values of observables and their poisson brackets , are manifestly covariant relative to such coordinate transformation",
    ". transformations of the second kind , corresponding to changes of the linear span of the @xmath106 basis , are known as _ gauge transformations_. because of the definition of the intrinsic subalgebra , the symplectic form @xmath107 is seen to be invariant under a gauge transformation . moreover , from the definition ( [ eq:25 ] ) , it follows that @xmath108|0\\rangle \\,.\\ ] ] thus , it follows that @xmath109 and hence the poisson bracket are also gauge invariant .",

    "given an abstract unitary representation @xmath62 of the dynamical group @xmath23 over a hilbert space @xmath3 , a coherent state representation @xmath111 is defined by specification of a functional @xmath112 .",

    "the coherent state representation @xmath111 is then defined by @xmath118(g ' ) = \\psi ( g'g ) \\,.\\ ] ] clearly there are many coherent state representations depending on the choice of the functional @xmath119 and hilbert space @xmath3 .",
    "if the functional @xmath119 is chosen such that @xmath120 where @xmath121 is a one - dimensional representation of the subgroup @xmath122 , we say that the coherent state representation @xmath111 is induced from the representation @xmath121 of @xmath61 .",
    "if @xmath23 is compact , the space @xmath116 of coherent state wave functions is contained in @xmath64 and @xmath111 is isomorphic to a subrepresentation of the regular representation  @xcite ( this can be seen from the inner product given in section [ sect : innerproducts ] ) .",
    "more generally , if @xmath123 is such that @xmath116 consists of all functions which satisfy equation  ( [ eq : hconstraint ] ) and whose absolute values are in @xmath124 , then @xmath111 is said to be a _ standard _ ( mackey ) induced representation  @xcite . in general , the representation @xmath111 is highly reducible . it will be shown in section  [ subsec : irreps ] that , by imposing extra conditions on the choice of the functional @xmath119 , it is possible to proceed directly to the irreducible representations of quantization .",
    "the above coherent state wavefunctions are defined as functions over the group @xmath23 . however , in practical applications , it is generally more useful to represent them as functions over a suitable set of @xmath39 coset representatives  @xcite . recall that a set of coset representatives @xmath125 defines a unique factorization @xmath126 , with @xmath127 , of every @xmath24 .",
    "hence , it follows from the identity ( [ eq : hconstraint ] ) that the restriction of @xmath128 to the subset @xmath129 is sufficient to uniquely define @xmath114 .",
    "often it is also convenient to consider factorizations of the type @xmath130 with @xmath131 and @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is a subset of @xmath134 coset representatives and @xmath135 and @xmath136 are the complex extensions of @xmath137 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "note that the identity ( [ eq : hconstraint ] ) does not require that the wavefunctions are functions on @xmath138 ; in general , @xmath114 need only be a section of a complex line bundle associated to the principal bundle @xmath139 .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath116 , then , can be viewed as a space of sections of a complex line bundle over @xmath138  @xcite .",

    "for example , it is possible to induce coherent state representations from a representation of a subgroup @xmath171 for which @xmath172 is not symplectic .",

    "the full quantization of an algebraic model corresponds to construction of an irreducible unitary representation of its sga .",
    "the usefulness of scalar coherent state induction , and indeed the full vcs theory , resides in its facility to construct such representations in a practical and computationally tractable manner .",
    "all that is needed is a functional @xmath170 that uniquely characterizes an irrep .",
