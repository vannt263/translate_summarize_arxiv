    "starting with the work of batchelor @xcite the study of passive scalars in smooth velocity fields has been the subject of numerous investigations .",
    "originally posed in 3d @xcite , the problem considered a situation where the viscosity ( @xmath1 ) of the flow is much greater than the diffusivity ( @xmath2 ) of the scalar . therefore , even at large reynolds numbers , for length scales below the viscous cutoff ( @xmath3 ) and above the diffusive cutoff ( @xmath4 ) , the so called batchelor regime , one has a smooth velocity advecting a diffusive tracer . since then",
    "the problem has grown to encompass a variety of phenomena such as chaotic advection ( see for eg .",
    "ottino @xcite ) and scalars in inverse cascading 2d turbulent flows ( see section iii in falkovich et .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) . of particular interest to us are applications in the realm of geophysical fluid dynamics , specifically , the mixing of scalars along isentropic surfaces via large scale atmospheric flows @xcite,@xcite .",
    "+ the equation governing the passive scalar ( @xmath5 ) is ,    @xmath6    let us denote the size of the domain by @xmath7 .",
    "this is a linear equation for @xmath5 , the velocity field is part of the prescribed data .",
    "the usual conditions imposed on the velocity field are that it be divergence free and smooth , i.e. , @xmath8 and @xmath9 everywhere in the domain .",
    "the questions asked are usually of the form : given an initial scalar field is it possible to determine the long time behaviour of the solution ?",
    "does one see the emergence of an eigenmode with a well defined decay rate , in other words what is the nature of the spectrum of the advection diffusion operator in a suitably defined function space ? usually , given the aperiodic nature of the advecting velocity fields the question is better posed in a statistical sense ,",
    "i.e. , is the asymptotic pdf of the scalar field self similar or is it an ever evolving ( _ non _ self similar ) entity ? as things stand , the results found in the literature are fairly divided .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to unify these results by bringing out certain salient features ( such as scale separation ) which have not been emphasized previously .",
    "+ most theoretical studies have focused on the case when the initial scale of variation of the scalar field ( say @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) is much smaller than that of the velocity field ( say @xmath12 , we take @xmath13 ) .",
    "the problem then is to determine the statistical properties of the scalar field at scales between @xmath12 and @xmath4 .",
    "a successful approach in this direction has been to shift to a comoving reference frame , use the decomposition @xmath14 and deal with the the effective equation that results from a substitution in eq .",
    "( [ 1a ] ) ( see for eg .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the expectation @xcite is that the scalar field will have _ non _ self similar pdf s . or , defining the moments of the scalar field as @xmath15 , balkovsky and fouxon @xcite",
    "explicitly show that ,    @xmath16    and that @xmath17 is a nonlinear function of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is a diffusive time scale which will be clarified later ) , implying the _ non _ self similarity of the pdf s .",
    "recent experiments @xcite with passive scalars injected at point sources in inverse cascading @xmath20d turbulent flows seem to validate some of these predictions .",
    "concrete evidence is available from numerical work demonstrating the nonlinearity of @xmath21 for scalars advected by realistic atmospheric winds @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that these simulations are over a time scale which represent the transient scalar behaviour rather than the asymptotic large time solution .",
    "+ on the other hand , there is a small body of work which deals with the case when @xmath22 , i.e. , the initial scale of variation of the scalar field is comparable to that of the velocity field , both of which are in turn comparable to the scale of the domain .. there are other problems of interest where @xmath23 which are studied in the context of turbulent diffusion ( see for eg .",
    "the comprehensive review by majda and kramer @xcite ) .",
    "+ ] the observation , based on numerical work @xcite,@xcite , is that the scalar field enters an eigenmode ( termed a `` strange eigenmode '' by pierrehumbert @xcite due to its spatial complexity ) .",
    "the pdf of the scalar becomes self similar ( after a suitable normalization by the variance ) or in terms of the moments , @xmath24 .",
    "recently experimental evidence for the emergence of such an eigenmode has been provided in the case of time periodic velocity fields @xcite .",
    "a line of attack on this problem has been to try and relate the finite time lyapunov exponents ( ftle s ) of the advecting flow to the statistical properties of the scalar field ( see @xcite and the references therein ) . even though this work @xcite is successful in describing the initial stages of the problem , the ftle s are by definition local entities and appear to be unsuitable precisely when @xmath25 .",
    "+ in this study we work with simple prescribed velocity fields in @xmath20d that have a single large scale ( of the kind encountered in studies of chaotic advection ) .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the power spectrum of such velocity fields is discrete .",
    "this is in contrast to technically smooth velocity fields which possess a heirarchy of scales . in other words",
    "the velocity fields considered are lipschitz continuous over all scales of interest ( i.e. , between @xmath26 and @xmath13 ) .",
    "the large single scale , divergence free and smooth nature of the velocity field implies that the trajectory equations do not show explosive ( implosive ) separation ( collapse ) as is generally expected in turbulent ( or multiple scale ) incompressible ( compressible ) velocity fields ( see for eg . gawedzki and vergassola @xcite ) .",
    "+ our first aim is to give further justification for the eigenmode in periodic and aperiodic velocity fields .",
    "we explicitly construct an area preserving deterministic @xmath20d map which , in spite of having weak barriers , demonstrates the emergence of a periodic eigenmode .",
    "moreover , we point out theorems in the dynamo literature which are applicable to the passive scalar problem , thereby providing analytical justification ( in terms of the purely discrete spectrum of the advection diffusion operator ) for the eigenmodes .",
    "the aperiodic case is free of barriers due to the random nature of the maps employed but is slightly novel in the sense that the notion of an eigenmode has to be weakened by invoking statistical stationarity ( i.e. self similarity of the pdf ) .",
    "secondly , we present a unified picture of the two seemingly disparate cases mentioned above . starting with a scalar field which satisfies @xmath27 , we observe an evolution in the shape of the pdf ( i.e. , the pdf is _ non _ self similar ) .",
    "this evolution ceases when the scales of the velocity and scalar fields become comparable ( i.e. , the field enters an eigenmode with a self similar pdf ) .",
    "the various regimes that the scalar field encounters are analyzed and a simple example , motivated by the work of balkovsky and fouxon @xcite , is used to elucidate the coupling between diffusion and the distribution of ftle s and its role in determining the pdf evolution . a discussion of the regimes , their universality and the issue of scale separation concludes the paper .",
    "physically when @xmath28 the scalar field feels the effect of the finite size of the domain , moreover , as @xmath25 it is difficult to justify any linearization of the underlying nonlinear trajectory equations .",
    "fortunately , the linear nature of eq .",
    "( [ 1a ] ) lends itself to an eigenvalue analysis .",
    "recently fereday et .",
    "al @xcite have looked at the eigenvalue problem for a specific velocity field ( represented by the bakers map ) .",
    "we consider the eigenvalue problem in its full generality as has been done for the magnetic field in the kinematic dynamo literature @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "most of the material in this subsection is well known in the dynamo literature , we present it here merely to put things in a well defined framework .",
    "let us recast eq .",
    "( [ 1a ] ) as ,    @xmath29    for a steady velocity field one can separate time by assuming a solution of the form @xmath30 . hence the eigenvalue problem is ,    @xmath31    here @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a banach space of square integrable functions , we are guaranteed that the scalar field will remain square integrable .",
    "+ ] defined on the domain d. we take d to be @xmath34 \\times [ 0,2\\pi]$ ] with opposite sides identified ( i.e. , a torus ) .",
    "the object of interest is the spectrum of the operator @xmath35 acting in _",
    "b_(d ) . as we are working in a banach space of infinite dimensions the spectrum depends strongly on the nature of the operator @xcite .",
    "+ if the operator in question were compact in a complete function space .",
    "let us denote the action of an operator @xmath36 on these functions by the sequence @xmath37 .",
    "if @xmath36 is closed with respect to this space and further if one can extract a convergent subsequence from @xmath37 then @xmath36 is called a compact operator .",
    "+ ] then the spectral theory of finite dimensional operators would carry over to our infinite dimensional problem @xcite .",
    "unfortunately differential operators are usually not compact , moreover they are unbounded .",
    "one of the techniques used to handle such operators is to gain control over their resolvents ( see kato @xcite chap .",
    "3 ) , the case when the operator is closed and its resolvent is compact is particularly clear cut @xcite . as it turns out this is precisely what happens to @xmath35 for steady velocity fields and non zero @xmath2 , i.e. , it is ( weakly ) closed on @xmath33 and has a compact resolvent @xcite.[multiblock footnote omitted ] hence its spectrum consists of a discrete set of eigenvalues of finite multiplicity ( kato @xcite p. 187 ) , in fact it has a complete set of eigenfunctions @xcite .",
    "physically the implication of a purely discrete spectrum is that the eigenvalues are well separated , as time goes on @xmath38 will assume the form of the eigenfunction corresponding to the largest eigenvalue .",
    "in the more general case of a periodic velocity field we have to consider the floquet problem involving the propagation of @xmath39 to @xmath40 where @xmath19 is the periodicity of the underlying flow . denoting the propagator by @xmath41 ,",
    "the eigenvalue problem is of the form ,    @xmath42    the discreteness of the spectrum of @xmath43 persists but the existence of a complete set of eigenfunctions is not gauranteed @xcite .",
    "essentially when the flow is smooth and @xmath44 , we are assuming that the spectral properties of @xmath35 follow those of @xmath45 ( eq . ( [ 1e ] ) ) for which there exist rigorous results in the cited dynamo literature .",
    "so , from a mathematical point of view the problem has a purely discrete set of eigenvalues and a ( possibly incomplete ) set of eigenfunctions for both steady and time periodic velocity fields . in passing we",
    "mention that the @xmath46 limit is expected to be quite delicate ; interesting aspects not encountered in the @xmath47 problem are likely to appear in this limiting process ( see bayly @xcite for some illuminating examples in regard to the analogous scalar dynamo problem ) .",
    "+      we proceed to see if we can numerically realize the eigenfunctions corresponding to the above mentioned eigenvalues .",
    "chaotic maps on a lattice are utilized to represent the advection process ( see pierrehumbert @xcite for a succinct overview of lattice maps in advection ) .",
    "the advantage of the lattice maps is the exact preservation of scalar moments and their numerical efficiency .",
    "this `` pulsed '' advection is followed by a diffusive step ( for eg .",
    "see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "usually maps with random phase shifts at each iteration are employed so as to break the kam tori which are generically present in deterministic area preserving maps . as this procedure gives an aperiodic time dependence to the flow it is unacceptable in the eigenvalue formulation outlined in the previous section .",
    "unfortunately , we are unaware of any area preserving , nonlinear and continuous map which has been proven to be mixing over the whole domain d. the only way we have of seeing that there are no regions where the scalar field remains trapped is to do so numerically , i.e. , to examine the variance as a function of time .",
    "the particular map we use mimics an alternating nonlinear shear flow ,    @xmath48    here @xmath49 are constant random numbers used to get the sine functions out of phase and @xmath50 are @xmath51 .",
    "the constants are @xmath52 and the initial condition of the scalar field is @xmath53 ( note that the scale of the scalar field is comparable to the scale of the flow ) .",
    "the diffusive step is implemented as ,    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is ,    @xmath56    here @xmath57 is the diffusion coeffecient and @xmath58 are the indices of the lattice .",
    "as is expected , for certain combinations of @xmath49 there are persistent kam barriers and we do not observe a decay of the scalar variance as would be expected from a globally mixing system .",
    "in fact , after a short time the diffusive exchange across the barriers controls the variance .",
    "@xmath59 provides an example of this phenomenon , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] shows the variance as a function of time for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the control of the variance by the diffusion coefficient is evident , moreover , a certain amount of scalar is trapped within the barriers ( the trapping would be permanent as @xmath46 , though the scaling of the amount that diffuses as a function of @xmath2 is expected to be nontrivial @xcite ) .",
    "+ on the other hand we get the desired global decay ( down to machine precision ) accompanied by the emergence of a periodic eigenmode for other pairs of @xmath49 .",
    "( namely , @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) .",
    "apart from using @xmath53 as an initial condition we also carried out the simulation using a checkerboard type initial condition where the field is discontinous but square integrable ( the initial conditions can be seen in the upper panel of fig . [",
    "fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "the spatial structure of the eigenmode at iteration @xmath64 and @xmath65 for the first initial condition can be seen in the first column of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] . the second column of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] shows the evolution of the scalar field for the second initial condition ( the eigenmode is shown at iteration 250 and iteration 650 ) . the upper panel fig .",

    "[ fig : fig2a ] . finally the self similar pdf s in steps of 25 iterations from iteration 250 to 650 can be seen in the lowermost panel of fig . [",
    "fig : fig2a ] . fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2b ] shows the same entities for the second initial condition ( see figure caption for details ) .",
    "the bimodal nature of the pdf indicates that there still exist regions which remain relatively isolated from each other . in a sense",
    "these regions are `` large enough '' to permit chaotic advection of the scalar within themselves and the barriers are `` leaky enough '' so the exchange of the scalar across them is strong enough so as _ not _ to be a controlling factor .",
    "note that due to the existence of these barriers the value of @xmath67 has to be reasonably large ( in our experiments the results for @xmath21 were identical for @xmath68 ) , if the system was mixing without any barriers then the results would be valid for infinitesimally small diffusivity .",
    "+ though the emphasis in the dynamo literature has been on the infinite magnetic reynolds number limit , there have been a few studies on the form of the eigenfunctions at finite magnetic reynolds numbers .",
    "the maps used in these studies are chosen for their mathematical properties ( such as the bakers map in @xcite or the cat map on an unusual reimannian manifold in @xcite ) , i.e. , one has good mixing properties over the whole domain .",
    "also , these maps allow analytical estimates of the form of the eigenfunctions , hence providing some insight into the generically singular infinite magnetic reynolds number limit ( in terms of convergence to some eigen - distribution @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately such maps are slightly unphysical , their chaotic properties are due to boundary conditions or due to the curvature of the underlying manifold rather than any inherent nonlinearity in the maps themselves .",
    "even though we choose not to use such maps for advective purposes , we would like to mention that their results ( especially @xcite ) are consistent with our work .",
    "+      in the aperiodic case there is no clean way to separate time from space as was done in the earlier situations . due to this we",
    "weaken the notion of an eigenfunction by invoking statistical stationarity , i.e. , the scalar field is said to enter an eigenmode when the shape of its pdf remains invariant with time ( upon renormalization by its variance as the overall field strength is decaying ) .",
    "note that the earlier classical eigenmode also has self - similar pdf s .",
    "of course it has a stronger form of convergence where the scalar field itself approaches a stationary ( or periodic ) spatial structure .",
    "the random map used to represent the aperiodic flow is again a nonlinear shear flow ,    @xmath69    now @xmath70 ( @xmath71 $ ] ) are random numbers which are selected at the beginning of each iteration .",
    "@xmath50 are @xmath51 , @xmath72 and the initial scalar field is @xmath73 .",
    "the map is iterated till the variance goes down to machine precision .",
    "the variance as a function of time can be seen in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] . after an initial transient ( which lasts for about @xmath74 iterations , see @xcite )",
    "the variance decays exponentially .",
    "the higher moments can be seen in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] . the non - anomalous nature of the exponents can be seen in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] , the implied self - similar behaviour of the pdf of the scalar field is demonstrated in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] .",
    "the pdf is unimodal as there are no isolated regions in the domain ( the randomness at each iteration is responsible for the destruction of any barriers that might exist in the steady map ) .",
    "moreover , the shape of the pdf is characterized by a gaussian core and stretched exponential tails , as per the higher resolution studies in pierrehumbert @xcite .",
    "+      the physical picture that goes along with the eigenmode is as follows : consider a filament of scalar whose length is comparable to the scale of variation of the velocity field ( or the typical size of an eddy in the velocity field ) . due to the assumed chaotic properties of a generic time dependent 2d flow",
    ", the filament will tend to be stretched out .",
    "the point is that , as the scale of the filament is already the same as that of the flow , instead of being merely stretched the filament will fold and start to fill the eddy .",
    "this process continues till the filament has been `` packed '' as tightly possible .",
    "note that it is the diffusion that is responsible for the `` packing '' , i.e. , for @xmath75 there is a limit on how thin a filament can get .",
    "once this situation is reached , as the problem is unforced , the whole structure remains stationary ( or periodic or statistically stationary depending on the flow ) till the diffusion destroys all the variance in the scalar field .",
    "we argue that the eigenmode is a representation of this `` packed '' structure .",
    "having gotten a feel for the situation when the initial scale of variation of the scalar field and that of the velocity field are comparable , we proceed to look into the evolution of an initially small scale scalar field , i.e. , @xmath76 . + as @xmath77 , via fourier s theorem , we can represent @xmath5 as ,    @xmath78    substituting a plane wave solution in eq .",
    "( [ 1a ] ) and equating the real and imaginary parts , we get ,    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is given by ,    @xmath81     +      in the eigenvalue formulation , when @xmath82 the scalar field is essentially in an infinite domain , the implication is that the spectrum of @xmath35 now typically consists of a continuous part and hence possesses eigenvalues which lie arbitrarily close to each other . as there is no dominant eigenvalue we will not see the emergence ( at short times ) of the corresponding eigenmode .",
    "+ taking advantage of @xmath83 we linearize eq .",
    "( [ 2c ] ) to obtain ,    @xmath84    from eq . ( [ 2b ] ) we have ,    @xmath85    therefore , in order to see how the moments behave at small times we need an estimate of how @xmath86 evolves .",
    "generally this is a fairly intricate question as the solution to eq .",
    "( [ 2d ] ) involves a time ordered exponentiation which reduces to a product of matrices @xcite .",
    "+      we mention some of the properties of the ftle s that will be needed for calculations in the forthcoming sections . in @xmath87",
    "we have the possibility of @xmath20 ( asymptotic ) lyapunov exponents .",
    "let us denote the larger of these by @xmath88 .",
    "furthermore let us denote the ftle along a particular trajectory , after @xmath18 iterations , by @xmath89 .",
    "note that physically the ftle s are defined with respect to the change in volume of a given set of initial conditions . in @xmath87 incompressible systems this only depends on the larger eigenvalue in the above mentioned matrix product . in higher dimensions",
    "the situation is more complicated as the ftle depends on the sum of the positive eigenvalues ( for continuous flows ) of the matrix product , i.e , it is closely related to the topological entropy of the dynamical system .",
    "+ in @xmath67 dimensions one has the possibility of @xmath67 ( asymptotic ) lyapunov exponents .",
    "let us denote them by @xmath90 .",
    "it is generally assumed that , along a particular trajectory , the probability of @xmath91 ( i.e. , the spectrum of lyapunov exponents calculated after @xmath18 iterations ) deviating from @xmath92 decays exponentially with @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "in fact it is generally taken for granted that each @xmath91 is governed by the central limit theorem ( clt ) and is distributed around @xmath92 @xcite ( see also the discussion in section @xmath93 of @xcite ) .",
    "we would like to mention that we are not aware of a general proof of this statement .",
    "having said this , we mention that the results of balkovsky and fouxon @xcite appear to lead in this direction though the status of the proof of the general statement is not very clear .",
    "the specific results we are aware of start with the work of furstenberg ( see @xcite ) , who showed that if the matrices are i.i.d ( i.e. delta correlated in time ) random matrices and if the system is incompressible , then @xmath94 . a stronger result , which is valid only in @xmath87 , has recently been shown by chertkov et .",
    "it states that if the tangent maps are random matrices with arbitrary ( but finite ) correlation time then @xmath95 , moreover @xmath89 obeys the clt and is distributed around @xmath88 .",
    "+ therefore , using the clt for @xmath89 in @xmath87 , the distribution of the ftle s can be expressed as ( see section @xmath96 of @xcite for the large deviation result ) ,    @xmath97    where @xmath98 is the cramer function and @xmath88 is the asymptotic lyapunov exponent .",
    "due to the mixing nature of the system , as @xmath99 the ftle s along ( almost ) every trajectory will tend to @xmath88 , moreover , the average of many realizations along a particular trajectory can be interpreted as a spatial average @xcite .",
    "+      at this initial stage the problem is completely reversible in the sense that the area of a given blob of scalar is invariant .",
    "physically when we release a small blob of scalar in a chaotic flow the tendency is for the blob to form a filament while respecting the conservation of area .",
    "mathematically this implies that on average @xmath80 grows with time , i.e. , one of the components of @xmath80 increases while the other decreases . the inference from eq .",
    "( [ 2f ] ) is that the moments of the scalar field decay in a faster than exponential fashion ( see for eg .",

    "the advantage of the inertia tensor like quantity is that its evolution explicitly captures the exponential growth of a blob s area which characterizes this regime .",
    "the chief assumption is that the eigenvalues of the inertia tensor , at any finite time @xmath100 , are governed by the clt and are distributed about the asymptotic lyapunov exponents @xmath143 . with this",
    "they are able to show that @xmath144 and that @xmath21 is a nonlinear function of @xmath18 , implying a _ non _ self similar pdf for the scalar field .",
    "+      we present a simple example to put some of the notions regarding the behaviour of @xmath21 in perspective .",
    "the objective is to analyze the evolution in concentration of a single non - self overlapping blob .",
    "let the blob s concentration be @xmath145 ( at time @xmath146 ) .",
    "now , the increase in area of the blob is controlled by the ftle at the position of the blob .",
    "therefore we have ,    @xmath147    hence ,    @xmath148    where @xmath108 , as before , indicates an average of many realizations over one trajectory .",
    "therefore we have ,    @xmath149    by a steepest descent argument , for @xmath150 , the above integral is dominated for @xmath151 ( implicitly ) given by ,    @xmath152    this implies @xmath153 , moreover for small @xmath18 eq .",
    "( [ 2p1 ] ) implies @xmath154 . in this region",
    "the cramer function is parabolic , i.e. , taking @xmath155 we have ,    @xmath156    substituting back we obtain ( for small @xmath18 ) ,    @xmath157    immediately it is clear that the pdf of the scalar field will be _ non _ self similar as @xmath21 is a nonlinear function of @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , the nonlinearity is due to fact that there is a distribution of ftle s .",
    "if we had a single ftle or if the ftle distribution collapsed to a delta function in a short time then the scaling would be non anomalous with @xmath158 .",
    "note that the explicit expression for @xmath21 given in eq .",
    "( [ 2r ] ) is only valid for small @xmath18 . from eq .",
    "( [ 2p1 ] ) the higher moments ( as in the previous regime ) are sensitive to the smaller ftle s . as our simple example follows balkovsky and fouxon s work ,",
    "their form for @xmath21 ( through more detailed considerations which take into account the diffusive overlap of many blobs ) is similar to eq .",
    "( [ 2r ] ) ( see eq . 3.9 in @xcite ) .",
    "we reiterate that even though the ftle distribution is responsible for the pdf evolution in this regime , fundamentally this is still a diffusive effect ( in the sense that it is the nonzero diffusivity that leads to the area evolution which characterizes this regime ) .",
    "+      the upshot of these considerations is that at these intermediate time scales we should observe an evolution in the pdf of the scalar field . to verify this , we plot the pdf s ( in steps of @xmath74 iterations from iteration @xmath159 to iteration @xmath160 ) in the upper panel of fig . [",
    "fig : fig9 ] .",
    "non _ self similarity is clearly evident .",
    "the anomalous nature of @xmath21 can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] .",
    "we observe that the pdf s are characterized by a ( progressively smaller ) gaussian core and ( progressively fatter ) stretched exponential tails .",
    "interestingly after about iteration @xmath161 the tails of the pdf tend to relax back to a purely exponential form ( which is the theoretically expected shape , see section iiib in falkovich et .",
    "the only discrepancy with theoretical predictions @xcite is that @xmath21 does not saturate at high @xmath18 , this might be due to the fact that we are numerically unable to get to high enough @xmath18 to actually observe the saturation ( _ note _ : see the example in the discussion ) .",
    "+      from the preceeding arguments it would appear that the scalar pdf is an ever evolving entity ( as is implied in @xcite ) , but once again from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] we see that the behaviour of the moments undergoes another change between iterations @xmath162 .",
    "we claim that it is at this stage that the scalar field actually enters the eigenmode , i.e , beyond iteration @xmath163 the pdf should become self similar .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] shows the pdf s ( again in steps of @xmath74 iterations from iteration @xmath163 to iteration @xmath164 ) .",
    "the self similar nature of the pdf s is clearly evident , also @xmath21 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] along with the @xmath21 from the previous regime ) follows @xmath24 .",
    "physically the scale of variation of the scalar field is now comparable to that of the velocity field , hence the velocity field separation used to derive eq .",
    "( [ 2k ] ) is invalidated .",
    "correspondingly in the ftle formulation the linearization breaks down .",
    "in fact , the problem is now in a situation where the mathematical considerations leading to the eigenmode ( section ii ) become applicable .",
    "in the first part of the paper we described the behaviour of a scalar field whose initial scale of variation was comparable to that of the advecting flow ( both of which were similar to the size of the domain ) . in both",
    ", periodic and aperiodic situations we demonstrated the emergence of scalar eigenmodes . in spite of the weak barriers that exist in the deterministic map used for periodic flows , the emergence of a scalar eigenmode is robust ( as is seen from the two different initial conditions ) . in the case of random maps , representing aperiodic flows , the mixing is global ( as the barriers are destroyed ) and the eigenmode is statistical in nature . along with the recent work of fereday et .",
    "@xcite this indicates that passive scalar advection - diffusion in chaotic flows can be insightfully treated as eigenvalue problem as is commonly done for steady flows ( see for eg .",
    "+ we then looked at the evolution of a passive scalar whose initial scale of variation was small as compared to that of the advecting flow ( again , the scale of the flow was comparable to the size of the domain ) . initially , as has been noted in previous studies @xcite , @xcite , the moments of the scalar field decay in a faster than exponential fashion .",
    "the pdf of the scalar field in this initial regime is an evolving entity , it is shown to be characterized by a gaussian core which shrinks with time . when the scalar filaments reach the diffusive scale the behaviour of the moments experiences a transition to a purely exponential decay .",
    "we emphasize that this transition is a diffusive effect . in this intermediate regime",
    "the pdf of the scalar field is still an evolving entity ( as is shown by balkovsky and fouxon @xcite , via the nonlinear dependence of @xmath21 on @xmath18 ) . by means of a simple example",
    ", the nonlinear nature of @xmath21 is shown to be dependent on the distribution of ftle s , moreover , the higher moments are seen to be sensitive to the tails of the ftle distribution . finally , when the scalar filamants have stretched and folded to fill the domain ( or have been `` packed '' as per our previous nomenclature ) the field enters an eigenmode .",
    "the eigenmode , as before , is characterized by self similar pdf s .",
    "numerical results of advection on a lattice followed by diffusion appear to confirm these stages of evolution .",
    "+ the above mentioned stages that an initially small scale scalar field encounters are robust , i.e. , once one enters a particular stage , the statistical properties of the scalar field are fixed .",
    "a caveat is that the duration of the stages , strongly depends on the strength of the advecting flow . as an illustration ,",
    "consider the same scalar field and map as in eq .",
    "( [ 2 g ] ) , but set @xmath165 ( i.e. , a flow with stronger stretching properties ) .",
    "the behaviour of the moments and @xmath21 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11 ] ( note that in this case , for the intermediate regime , @xmath21 does appear to saturate for large @xmath18 ) .",
    "the stronger nature of the flow causes the first stage to be very short , the intermediate stage is also relatively shorter as the filaments fill the domain quickly .",
    "finally , the eigenmode is realized and persists till all the variance is destroyed .",
    "+ in essence the picture that emerges is fairly straightforward , as long as there is a valid scale separation ( i.e. , till @xmath27 ) the pdf s of the scalar field are evolving entities , albeit involving stages characterized by distinct decay of moments .",
    "whereas , as soon as @xmath28 , the scalar field enters an eigenmode with stationary or self similar pdf s .",
    "interestingly , some of our preliminary numerical work indicates that when we consider @xmath166 , the self similarity is maintained whereas the shape of the pdf is altered .",
    "in fact , smaller the scale of the velocity field the more gaussian is the self similar scalar pdf . as future work we plan to look deeper into these cases , especially in light of the recent results on non diffusive asymptotic self similarity of turbulent decay ( i.e. where the advecting flows themselves are self similar and nonsmooth ) as put forth by chaves et .",
