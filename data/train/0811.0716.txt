    "method of multipe - quantum nuclear magnetic resonance ( mq nmr ) in solids @xcite is a powerful tool for the investigations of structure and spin dynamics in solids @xcite .",
    "significant progress has been made in the simplification of ordinary nmr spectra @xcite .",
    "recently , higher - order mq nmr experiments have been utilized to address one of the fundamental issues in quantum information processing , the preparation of the pseudopure state @xcite .",
    "a quantum computation includes as an initial step preparation of the input state @xcite . conveniently , the quantum algorithms start with a pure ground state where populations of all states except the ground state are equal to zero .",
    "the realization of a pure state in a real quantum system , such as a spin system , requires extremely low temperatures and very high magnetic fields . to overcome this problem , a so - called pseudopure  state was introduced @xcite .",
    "the density matrix of the spin system in this state can be partitioned into two parts .",
    "the first part of the matrix is a scaled unit matrix , and the second part corresponds to a pure state .",
    "the scaled unit matrix does not contribute to observables , and it is not changed by unitary evolution transformations . therefore , the behavior of a system in the pseudopure state is exactly the same as it would be in the pure state .",
    "recently , it has been suggested @xcite to consider the dipolar ordered state as the initial state for such experiments . as a result of using the dipolar ordered initial condition",
    ", many - spin clusters and correlations appear faster @xcite than in the ordinary mq nmr experiments @xcite in solids and some peculiarities of multiple - quantum ( mq ) dynamics can be investigated with these experiments .    in the present article we consider mq nmr dynamics when the initial condition is determined by the pseudopure state .",
    "our motivation of performance of this work is defined first of all by that the many - spin correlations are created faster in such experiments then in standard mq nmr methods and can be used for the investigation of many - spin dynamics of nuclear spins in solids .",
    "we consider dynamics of mq nmr in systems prepared in the pseudopure state and calculate the resulting signal in mq experiments .",
    "note , that it is not necessary to make any changes in the scheme of the standard experiment in order to obtain non - zero signals of mq coherences in the pseudopure state .",
    "computer simulations of such experiments for six spin ring and eight spin linear chain are presented .",
    "we consider a system of nuclear spins ( @xmath0 ) coupled by the dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) in a strong external magnetic field @xmath1  which is directed along the axis @xmath2 .",
    "the secular part of the ddi hamiltonian @xcite has the following form @xmath3   , \\tag{1}%\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the coupling constant between spins @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath8 is the distance between spins @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath9 is the angle between the internuclear vector @xmath10 and the external magnetic field .",
    "@xmath11 is the projection of the angular spin momentum operator on the axis @xmath12 @xmath13 ; @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the raising and lowering operators of spin  @xmath5 .",
    "there are many pulse sequences exciting mq coherences during the preparation period . for a dipolar - coupled spin system",
    ", the multipulse sequence with an eight - pulse cycle @xcite is known to be very efficient .",
    "the basic scheme of the standard mq nmr experiments consists of four distinct periods of time : preparation , evolution , mixing and detection @xcite . in the rotating reference frame @xcite",
    "the average hamiltonian describing the mq dynamics at the preparation period can be presented as @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "then the evolution period without any pulses follows .",
    "the density matrix of the spin system , @xmath18 , at the end of the preparation period is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the evolution operator on the preparation period and @xmath21 is the initial density matrix of the system .",
    "the transfer of the information about mq coherences to the observable magnetization occurs during the mixing period .",
    "usually the thermodynamical equilibrium density matrix is used as the initial one for mq nmr experiments . in the high temperature approximation",
    "the equilibrium density matrix takes a form : @xmath22 .",
    "here we consider mq nmr dynamics with the initial pseudopure state when the density matrix can be described as:@xmath23 where @xmath24 represents a @xmath25th spin that is up and @xmath26 is the number of spins in the system .",
    "the method of creating the highly polarized spin states ( 4 ) in clusters of coupled spins was described previously @xcite .",
    "it is based on filtering multiple - quantum coherence of the highest order , followed by a time - reversal period and partial saturation .",
    "it is convenient to expand the density matrix , @xmath18 , at the end of the preparation period of the mq nmr experiment as @xcite @xmath27 where the term @xmath28 is responsible for the mq coherence of the @xmath29-th order .",
    "one can find @xmath30 on the mixing period the spin system is irradiated with sequence of the pulses shifted on a @xmath31phase regarding the pulses of the preparation period @xcite . as a result the average hamiltonian describing evolution of the spin system on the mixing period changes a sign on opposite to the sign of the hamiltonian ( 2 ) , and the evolution operator , @xmath32 is replaced by the operator @xmath33  starting with the initial conditions ( 4 ) , the density matrix , @xmath34 , after the three periods of the standard mq nmr experiment can be written as    @xmath35    where @xmath18  is the density matrix at the end of the preparation period according to eq .",
    "( 3 ) and @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the frequency offset on the evolution period of the duration @xmath38 which is a result of applying the time proportional phase incrementation ( tppi ) method @xcite .",
    "the transfer of the information about mq coherences to the observable magnetization occurs during the mixing period .",
    "the last unitary transformation in ( 7 ) with operator @xmath39  describes this period .",
    "the resulting signal after the mixing period , the longitudinal magnetization , @xmath40 , is @xmath41 using eqs . ( 3 ) and ( 7 ) and the initial condition ( 4 ) it is convenient to present the formula ( 8) for the longitudinal magnetization , @xmath42  as follows@xmath43 where @xmath44 coincides with the density matrix at the end of the preparation period of the  standard mq nmr experiment with the thermodynamical equilibrium density matrix as the initial condition at high temperature approximation @xcite .",
    "the density matrix @xmath45 can be represented in the following form @xcite @xmath46 where the term @xmath47 is responsible for the mq coherence of the @xmath29-th order and satisfies to the relationship of eq .",
    "( 6 ) . by using eqs .",
    "( 6 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 9 ) one can rewrite the expression for the observable signal in terms of the intensities of mq coherences @xmath48 where @xmath49 are the normalized intensities of mq coherences are @xmath50 one can find from eq . ( 13 ) that @xmath51 it is well known that in the usual mq nmr experiments , the sum of the intensities of all mq coherences does not depend on time @xmath52 .",
    "this is also right for the mq nmr in the pseudopure state .",
    "we restrict ourselves to numerical simulations of mq nmr dynamics of one - dimensional systems .",
    "for example , quasi - one - dimensional six dipolar - coupled proton spins of a benzene molecule @xcite and hydroxyl proton chains in calcium hydroxyapatite @xmath53 @xcite and fluorine chains in calcium fluorapatite @xmath54 @xcite are suitable objects to study mq dynamics in pseudopure states . the numerical calculations were performed for mq nmr dynamics of linear chains and rings of 6 and 8 spins .",
    "the ddi coupling constant of the nearest neighbors is chosen to be @xmath55",
    ". then the coupling constants of spins @xmath5 and @xmath6 are @xmath56   ^{3}$ ] for ring and @xmath57 for chain , respectively . in order to compare the results of the numerical simulations with the analogous ones for the ordinary mq nmr dynamics we introduce the normalized intensities of mq coherences for the @xmath29 order ,",
    "@xmath58 @xcite @xmath59 the dependences of the intensities of mq coherences on the dimensionless time , @xmath60 , of the preparation period in spin ring containing six spins are presented in fig . 1 for the both initial states , equilibrium ( a ) and pseudopure ( b ) .",
    "one can compare the intensities of mq coherences in the suggested experiment with the standard ones .",
    "it is evident that the suggested method can be considered as a useful addition to the standard mq nmr method .",
    "1 demonstrates that the suggested method yields the intensities of mq coherences of the fourth and six orders which several times higher than the analogous coherence in the standard mq nmr experiment .",
    "it is clear from the insets of fig .",
    "1 that mq coherence of the fourth and sixth orders , obtained with the initial condition ( 4 ) , appear little earlier than in the usual mq nmr in a ring of six spins .",
    "for example , or the pseudopure state at time @xmath61 the mq intensity of the fourth order coherence is @xmath62 ( red dash line ) while for the usually used initial condition up to @xmath63  the intensity @xmath64 is closed to zero ( black solid line ) .",
    "a tendency of the faster growth of mq coherences of high orders takes place also for the linear chain containing eight spins ( fig .",
    "this peculiarity is connected with the initial pseudopure state ( 4 ) . as a result , many - spin clusters and correlations connected with mq coherences appear faster than in the standard mq nmr with the initial condition , @xmath22 .",
    "the numerical calculations confirm also the results obtained in the previous section .",
    "in particular , the growth of mq coherences occurs in accordance with eq .",
    "( 14 ) .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "2 that the observable intensities of the fourth and sixth orders in the linear chain containing eight spins can be negative in contrast to the ordinary mq nmr experiments at high temperatures @xcite . at the same time",
    ", it was shown @xcite that the intensities of mq coherences can be negative in the standard nmr experiments at low temperatures and in the dipolar ordered state at high temperatures .",
    "in fact , in mq nmr experiments the observable quantity is the longitudinal magnetization modulated by rf pulses .",
    "the distinct frequency components of the magnetization can have an arbitrary sign .",
    "the mq nmr method for the detection of mq coherences starting from the pseudopure state is proposed .",
    "investigations of mq nmr dynamics in the pseudopure states can be considered as a supplementary method which complements the usual nmr in order to study structures and dynamical processes in solids .",
    "many - spin clusters and many - spin correlations are created faster in such experiments than in the usual mq nmr with the initial equilibrium condition without any correlation between the spins . in this paper we focused on simple one - dimensional examples but the physical picture obtained here",
    "is not limited to perform simulations and experiments in two - dimensional and three dimensional systems and open new ways for the study of many - spin systems .",
