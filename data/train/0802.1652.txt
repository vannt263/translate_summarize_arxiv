    "our goal is to study the mirabolic character sheaves introduced in  @xcite . according to lusztig s results , the unipotent character sheaves on @xmath0",
    "are numbered by the set of partitions of @xmath1 .",
    "for such a partition @xmath2 we denote by @xmath3 the corresponding character sheaf . if the base field is @xmath4 , the frobenius trace function of a character sheaf @xmath5 on a unipotent class of type @xmath6 is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the kostka - foulkes polynomial , and @xmath9 , see  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath10 , so that @xmath11 . for a pair of partitions @xmath12 such that @xmath13 the corresponding unipotent mirabolic character sheaf @xmath14 on @xmath15 was constructed in  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath16-orbits in the product of the unipotent cone and @xmath17 are also numbered by the set of pairs of partitions @xmath18 such that @xmath19 ( see  @xcite ) . in theorem",
    "[ past ] we compute the frobenius trace function of a mirabolic character sheaf @xmath14 on an orbit corresponding to @xmath18 .",
    "the answer is given in terms of certain polynomials @xmath20 , the mirabolic analogues of the kostka - foulkes polynomials introduced in  @xcite .",
    "more generally , in  [ medium ] we compute the frobenius trace functions ( on any orbit ) of a wide class of weil mirabolic character sheaves .",
    "these trace functions form a basis in the space of @xmath21-invariant functions on @xmath22 , and we conjecture that the above class of sheaves exhausts all the irreducible @xmath23-equivariant weil mirabolic character sheaves . this would give a positive answer to a question of g.  lusztig .",
    "recall that the kostka - foulkes polynomials are the matrix coefficients of the transition matrix from the hall - littlewood basis to the schur basis of the ring @xmath24 of symmetric functions .",
    "similarly , the polynomials @xmath20 are the matrix coefficients of the transition matrix from a certain _ mirabolic hall - littlewood _ basis of @xmath25 ( introduced in  @xcite ) to the schur basis , see  [ fast ] . recall that @xmath24 is isomorphic to the hall algebra  @xcite whose natural basis goes to the basis of hall - littlewood polynomials .",
    "similarly , @xmath25 is naturally isomorphic to a certain _ mirabolic hall bimodule _ over the hall algebra , and then the natural basis of this bimodule goes to the mirabolic hall - littlewood basis , see section  [ hall ] .",
    "the structure constants of this basis , together with green s formula for the characters of @xmath21 , enter the computation of the frobenius traces of the previous paragraph .",
    "the hall algebra is also closely related to the spherical hecke algebra @xmath26 of @xmath0 ( the convolution algebra of the affine grassmannian of @xmath0 ) .",
    "similarly , the mirabolic hall bimodule is closely related to a certain _ spherical mirabolic bimodule _ over @xmath26 , defined in terms of convolution of the affine grassmannian and the _ mirabolic affine grassmannian _ , see section  [ grass ] .",
    "the geometry of the mirabolic affine grassmannian is a particular case of the geometry of the _ mirabolic affine flag variety _ studied in section  [ flaff ] .",
    "both geometries are ( mildly ) semiinfinite .",
    "thus all the results of this note",
    "are consequences of a single guiding principle which may be loosely stated as follows : the mirabolic substances form a bimodule over the classical ones ; this bimodule is usually free of rank one .    however , the affine mirabolic bimodule @xmath27 over the affine hecke algebra @xmath28 is not free ( see remark  [ hissing ] ) . recall that @xmath28 can be realized in the equivariant @xmath29-homology of the steinberg variety .",
    "it would be very interesting to find a similar realization of @xmath27 .",
    "finally let us mention that the results of this note are very closely related to the results of  @xcite , though our motivations are rather different .",
    "the authors of  @xcite were primarily interested in the geometry of enhanced nilpotent cone .",
    "they proved the parity vanishing of the ic stalks of the orbit closures in the enhanced nilpotent cone , and identified the generating functions of these stalks with shoji s type - b kostka polynomials .",
    "since the schubert varieties in the mirabolic affine grassmannian are equisingular to the orbit closures in the enhanced nilpotent cone ( see  [ lusztig ] ,  [ mir ] ) , the appearance of shoji s polynomials in the spherical mirabolic bimodule and in the mirabolic hall bimodule is an immediate corollary of  @xcite .",
    "we are indebted to g.  lusztig for his question about classification of mirabolic character sheaves over a finite field .",
    "we are obliged to p.  achar and a.  henderson for sending us  @xcite before its publication , and bringing  @xcite to our attention .",
