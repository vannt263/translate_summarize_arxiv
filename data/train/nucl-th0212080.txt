    "understanding the properties of nuclear matter at both , normal and high densities , is of crucial importance in explaining the appearance of neutron stars after the supernova explosion and the formation of transiron elements in nuclear reactions .",
    "one of the most popular relativistic models is the non - linear walecka model @xcite , which can be used in order to obtain different equations of state ( eos ) as far as different parameter sets are employed . in this work",
    "we investigate the consequences in the eos when the parametrizations of the well known nl3 model @xcite , which is a good parametrization in describing finite nuclei properties , are changed to the density dependent one proposed in @xcite .",
    "the new parametrization is determined by fitting several nuclear matter bulk properties and also some finite nuclei .",
    "both models were investigated considering two types of proton fractions : fixed ones and those arising when @xmath0-equilibrium is incorporated .",
    "some considerations are also done in relation to the tm1 parameter set @xcite .",
    "the extension of the density dependent parametrization to finite temperature eos is also investigated .",
    "this extension has been partially studied in @xcite for symmetric nuclear matter only . in nuclear collisions involving stable or radioactive neutron rich nuclei , in experiments yielding nuclear multifragmentation , in protoneutron stars , among inumerous examples , the resulting matter is known to carry a reasonable amount of isospin asymmetry .",
    "hence , in the present work , a more complete and detailed study is performed in order to account for asymmetric matter as well .",
    "we start from the lagrangian density of the relativistic non - linear model , adapted in order to accommodate the nl3 , tm1 forces and the density dependent meson - nucleon coupling constants @xcite : & = & | + & & + ( _ ^-m_^2 ^2 ) - ^3 -^4 + & & -_^+ m_^2 _ ^ + _ ^4 ( _ ^)^2 + & & -_^+ m_^2 _ ^ , [ lag1 ] where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the scalar - isoscalar , vector - isoscalar and vector - isovector meson fields respectively , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 . besides this , @xmath6 is the nucleon mass , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the masses of the mesons and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the nucleon - meson coupling constants .",
    "@xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the self - interacting scalar and vector coupling constants . in this work",
    "we investigate the differences arising from three parameter sets , namely nl3 @xcite , tm1 @xcite and tw @xcite . in the first two cases ,",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the usual @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in the second case ,",
    "the density dependent coupling constants are adjusted in order to reproduce some of the nuclear matter bulk properties , using the parametrization given in @xcite .",
    "other possibilities for these parameters are also found in the literature @xcite . in the tw parametrization the meson self - coupling constants @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are zero .",
    "the nuclear matter bulk properties described by these three parameter sets are displayed in table 1 .    from the euler - lagrange equations we obtain the field equations of motion in the mean field approximation for infinite matter , where the meson fields are replaced by their expectation values . in this approximation , the expectation value of the @xmath1 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 meson fields",

    "the energy - momentum tensor one easily obtains the hamiltonian operator : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the volume of the system . in the above equation the rearrangement term cancels out . notice that as a consequence , the energy density does not carry the rearrangement term either and can be written in the semi - classical thomas - fermi approximation as @xmath37 note that for the nl3 parametrization , the term @xmath38 also appears in the energy density equation and for the tm1 these two terms come together with @xmath39 . following the notation in @xcite , the thermodynamic potential can be written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the entropy density of a classical fermi gas",
    ", @xmath42 is the temperature , @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is the proton ( neutron ) chemical potential and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are respectively the proton and neutron densities , calculated in such a way that @xmath47 .",
    "we have @xmath48 where the distribution functions @xmath49 and @xmath50 for particles and anti - particles have to be derived in order to make the thermodynamic potential stationary for a system in equilibrium .",
    "after straightforward substitutions , eq.([omega1 ] ) becomes @xmath51 for a complete demonstration of the above shown expressions obtained in a thomas - fermi approximation for the non - linear walecka model , please refer to @xcite . at this point ,",
    "eq.([omega2 ] ) is minimized in terms of the distribution functions for fixed meson fields , i.e. , @xmath52 for the proton distribution function , the above calculation yields @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "similar equations , with some sign differences are obtained for the anti - proton , neutron and anti - neutron distribution functions .",
    "the effective chemical potentials are then defined as @xmath55 and the following equations for the distribution functions can be written : @xmath56}\\ ; , \\quad i = p , n . \\label{disfun}\\ ] ] in the above calculation we have used @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the proton fraction is defined as @xmath59 .    within the thomas - fermi approach the pressure becomes @xmath60 in the nl3 model ,",
    "the term @xmath61 is also present in ( [ pressure ] ) and in the tm1 model these terms are also accompanied by @xmath62 .",
    "it is also important to stress that the thermodynamical consistency which requires the equality of the pressure calculated from the thermodynamical definition and from the energy - momentum tensor , discussed in @xcite , is also obeyed by the temperature dependent tw model .",
    "another quantity of interest is the nuclear bulk symmetry energy discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is usually defined as @xmath63 with @xmath64 and which can be analytically rewritten as @xmath65 where @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "the value and behavior of the symmetry energy at densities larger than nuclear saturation density are still not well established .",
    "this quantity is important in studies involving neutron stars and radioactive nuclei . in general ,",
    "relativistic and non - relativistic models give different predictions for the symmetry energy .",
    "a comparison between the symmetry energies coming from the nl3 and the tw models is also discussed in the present work .",
    "at this point , we introduce the ideas of @xmath0 stability and charge neutrality . in an ideal system of protons , neutrons , electrons and muons in equilibrium ,",
    "the particle levels are filled in such a way that the @xmath0 decays are forbidden . in order to study the conditions of @xmath0 equilibrium",

    "( [ lag1 ] ) and @xmath71 describes the two lightest leptons , i.e. , the electron and the muon , whose masses are respectively @xmath72 mev and @xmath73 mev .",

    "( [ enerd ] ) and ( [ pressure ] ) respectively .",
    "notice that the leptons are considered as a gas of non - interacting relativistic particles , in such a way that the minimization of the thermodynamic potential is not altered by their presence .",
    "the already mentioned requirement of charge neutrality yields @xmath83 where the electron and muon densities can be read off from equation ( [ rhoi ] ) by substituting @xmath84 by @xmath71 . from the condition of chemical equilibrium in the weak processes , obtained from the minimization of the gibbs potential with the conditions of baryon number and electric charge conservation , one",
    "is left with the following relations between the chemical potentials @xmath85 common definitions for the lepton fractions are @xmath86 , although the lepton densities are not part of the baryon density .",
    "some consequences of the imposition of @xmath0 stability in relativistic models are discussed in @xcite .",
    "in figure [ fig1 ] we show the zero temperature eos for different proton fractions and two of the parameter sets used in this work , i.e. , nl3 and tw .",
    "the tw parametrization makes the eos softer not only for symmetric nuclear matter ( @xmath87 ) , as discussed in @xcite , but also for all other proton fraction possibilities .",
    "the same is true if @xmath0 stability is imposed . in figure [ fig2 ] the eos",
    "is plotted for @xmath88 mev and again , a behavior similar to that of figure [ fig1 ] is observed .",
    "notice , however , that the minima of all curves are shifted upwards and that the curves for @xmath89 , which do not exhibit minima for @xmath90 acquire them once the temperature increases .    in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "we show the eos for neutron matter ( @xmath89 ) at different temperatures , namely , @xmath90 , @xmath88 mev , @xmath91 mev and @xmath92 mev . at very low densities",
    "the inclination of the curves vary substancially from low to high temperatures .",
    "this is because in this region of low densities , the thermal energy @xmath93 is an appreciable fraction of the fermy energy @xmath94 , making the effects of the temperature , in particular the particle - antiparticle creation , more dramatic in this regime than at high densities , were @xmath94 is greater . in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "the eos is plotted , this time for symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "one can see the change in the minumum from a negative to a positive value , which becomes very large for high temperatures .",
    "once can also notice that the minima of all curves are slightly shifted to higer densities .    from the analysis of figures [ fig1]-[fig2 ]",
    "we conclude that the tw parametrization is softer than the nl3 one .",
    "this can be explained looking for the @xmath95 parametrizations in the limit of @xmath96 . in this limit",
    "we have @xmath97 at such high densities , the system interacts mainly trough the exchange of the meson @xmath22 , once the scalar meson @xmath1 saturates as @xmath98 .",
    "the @xmath11 coupling constant of the nl3 model is the same as at the saturation density , while equation ( [ lim1 ] ) says that , in this limit , the @xmath11 coupling constant for the tw parametrization is lower than the value at the saturation point .",
    "tw is thus less repulsive at high densities than nl3 , which makes its eos softer .",
    "this fact has important consequences , for example when modeling neutron stars .",
    "a soft eos provides a neutron star with a total mass lower than the value obtained with a stiff eos .",
    "we have also checked that the tw parametrization provides an eos softer than the one obtained with the tm1 force @xcite and closer to the relativistic brueckner - hartree - fock ( rbhf ) eos @xcite , as can be seen in figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] for @xmath90 and @xmath91 mev and symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the same is true for other proton fractions .",
    "the rbhf theory produces well the nuclear matter saturation based on the nucleon - nucleon interaction determined by scattering experiments .",
    "the tm1 parametrization includes a non - linear @xmath22 term and hence works with one extra parameter which is also adjusted in order to reproduce nuclear matter bulk properties .",
    "we then conclude that the tw parameter set is a very useful force in the studies involving eos at high densities .    in figure [ fig7 ]",
    "the symmetry energy is displayed for nl3 and tw for pure neutron matter and symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "different proton fractions give rise to slightly different curves because of the difference in fermi momenta and in the effective mass , which enters in @xmath99 . according to @xcite the symmetry energy at normal nuclear matter density",
    "is found to lay in between 27 and 36 mev in the mass formula calculations , in the range of 28 to 38 mev in non - relativistic models and in between 35 and 42 mev in relativistic models .",
    "notice that at the saturation point , the value for the tw parametrization ( 32 mev ) is somewhat lower than for the nl3 , remains in the accepted range of validity and is closer to the predictions of non - relativistic models .",
    "moreover , the curves obtained for the tw model present a much smaller symmetry energy at larger densities and also a smoother behavior as compared with the curves arising from the nl3 model , which gives a more linear tendency to the curve . this result can be explained looking at equation ( [ lim2 ] ) , which tell us that @xmath18 goes to zero at high densities , consequently so does its contribution in equation ( [ esym ] ) .",
    "on the opposite , @xmath18 in the nl3 parametrization is constant as a function of density .",
    "we have finally studied the particle composition once @xmath0 stability is imposed . in figures",
    "[ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] the particle composition obtained at @xmath90 respectively for nl3 and tw are shown . in figure [ fig10 ]",
    "we show the proton and neutron composition for nl3 and tw at @xmath90 mev and tw at @xmath88 mev .",
    "one can see that if the temperature does not increase much , the particle composition for a fixed parameter set remains basically the same .",
    "nevertheless , it changes substancially from nl3 to tw .",
    "in particular , at high densities , we can see that tw is less isospin - symmetric than nl3 .",
    "this is due , again , to the result ( [ lim2 ] ) , which says that , for tw , the @xmath23-nucleon interaction is suppressed at high densities .",
    "it is precisely this interaction which drives the systems to a more isospin - symmetric configuration at high densities , as we can see in figure ( [ fig8 ] ) for nl3 , where this interaction survives in this limit .",
    "an extension of this work in order to study liquid - gas phase transition and consequent droplet formation is currently under investigation .",
    "this work was partially supported by cnpq - brazil .",
