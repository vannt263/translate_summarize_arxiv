    "in the decade that has passed since the pioneering analytical study of glfi and rcz  @xcite , there has emerged a substantial body of research devoted to experimental  @xcite , computational  @xcite and analytical  @xcite studies of reaction - diffusion systems with two initially separated , diffusing species a and b reacting to produce an inert product c according to the chemical formula @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the stoichiometric coefficients , are positive integers .",
    "theoretical studies have focused almost exclusively on the one - dimensional  case of an infinite , flat reaction front between two regions of homogeneous composition of either a or b ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cartoon ] ) .",
    "this idealized situation is believed to capture much of the essential physics of reaction fronts commonly observed in various chemical  @xcite and biological  @xcite systems .",
    "the standard continuum model for such a one - dimensional reaction front involves a pair of nonlinear partial differential equations  @xcite    & = & d_a - m^r(_a,_b ) + & = & d_b - n^r(_a,_b ) , [ eq : coup ]    subject to the boundary conditions @xmath12 and the initial conditions @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the concentrations , @xmath16 and @xmath17 the diffusion coefficients of a and b , respectively , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are constants , @xmath20 is the heaviside unit step function and @xmath21 is the reaction rate density for production of species c. ( note that upper - case letters denote quantities with dimensions , e.g. @xmath22 and @xmath23 for space and time , respectively .",
    "lower - case letters for the corresponding dimensionless quantities are introduced in section  [ sec : dim ] . )",
    "the reactants are completely separated at first according to ( [ eq : rhoic ] ) , but for @xmath24 they diffuse together and react , which decreases the concentrations wherever @xmath25 .",
    "diffusion acts to replenish any depleted regions . as a result the system develops a localized , moving region , the reaction front ,  where the reaction rate @xmath21 is greatest and which is fed by diffusion from the distant particle reservoirs described by the boundary conditions .",
    "the dynamics of this reaction front are described by the long - time asymptotics of the nonlinear initial - boundary - value problem ( [ eq : coup])([eq : rhoic ] ) .",
    "the nonlinear reaction term @xmath21 is usually assumed to have the form of a power law @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a rate constant , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are respectively the kinetic orders  of a and b in the reaction  @xcite .",
    "for a one - step reaction with sufficient mixing ( see below ) @xmath30 and @xmath31 , but for more complex , multi - step reactions @xmath28 and @xmath29 are determined by the stoichiometric coefficients of the ( often unknown ) rate - limiting step . although @xmath28 and @xmath29 are usually taken to be positive integers , non - integer values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 can arise in certain situations  @xcite .",
    "we will see that a well - defined reaction front exists for any real numbers @xmath32 , but not for @xmath33 or @xmath34 .    technically , by assuming in ( [ eq : coup ] ) that the reaction rate @xmath4 depends only on the average local concentrations ( and not on any fluctuations or many - body effects ) we have made the mean - field approximation",
    "  @xcite . in low - dimensional systems , such as ion channels ( @xmath35 ) or catalytic surfaces ( @xmath36 ) ,",
    "the mean - field approximation can break down because the reacting particles can not mix efficiently enough , but as the dimension of the system is increased above a certain upper critical dimension ",
    "@xmath37 , such statistical anomalies disappear . for two diffusing reactants with a simple one - step reaction",
    "it is known  @xcite that @xmath38 . since @xmath39 for @xmath40",
    "the mean - field approximation should be perfectly valid in the usual case @xmath41 , which is consistent with experimental findings  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the case of two diffusing reactants described above , relatively little is known  @xcite about the case of one diffusing reactant ( @xmath42 ) and one static reactant ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "this situation , depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] , describes the corrosion of a porous solid b saturated with a fluid solvent and exposed to an initially separated colloidal reactant a , as shown in recent electrochemical experiments ( described below )  @xcite .",
    "jiang and ebner  @xcite first pointed out ( for @xmath44 ) that setting @xmath45 in ( [ eq : coup ] ) is a non - trivial , i.e. singular , limit leading to different long - time behavior than in the case of @xmath46 ( no matter how small ) , which they explained with simple scaling arguments supported by monte carlo computer simulations . for an analytical description of such one - dimensional diffusion with one static reactant",

    "[ eq : rho ]    in the simplest case @xmath44 , the initial - boundary - value problem ( [ eq : rhobc])([eq : rho ] ) has been solved numerically by havlin et al .",
    "@xcite and analyzed in the limit of `` long times '' @xmath47 by koza  @xcite , using various asymptotic approximations introduced by glfi and rcz  @xcite .",
    "rigorous analysis has been reported in the analogous limit of `` fast reactions '' @xmath48 by hilhorst et al .",
    "@xcite , but these authors only address the behavior at the diffusive length scale @xmath49 ( see section  [ sec : diff ] below ) and do not consider the structure of the reaction front studied by koza  @xcite , which is of primary interest here .",
    "hilhorst et al .",
    "have also recently considered the effect of a more general reaction term at the diffusive scale  @xcite , but the present work appears to be the first to analyze the nontrivial effect of changing reaction orders at the reactive length scale ( see below ) in the general case ( @xmath50 ) with one static reactant .",
    "the relevance of ( [ eq : rho ] ) for a given porous - solid corrosion system rests on several key assumptions that are less obviously satisfied _ a priori _ than in the case of two diffusing reactants .",
    "first , the solid matrix containing the static reactant b must be sufficiently porous that the moving reactant a can diffuse freely to the exposed surfaces with an effective diffusion constant ( averaged over many pores ) comparable to that in the bulk solvent .",
    "the concentration of a must also be dilute enough that @xmath16 is constant .",
    "another reason that the concentrations of a and b must be dilute is that the inert product c must be created in small enough quantities that its presence does not affect the reaction dynamics ( e.g. by inhibiting diffusion or initiating convection ) . finally , one might worry about the breakdown of the mean - field approximation since the ( possibly fractal ) pore structure may influence statistical averaging .",
    "for example , it is known that fluctuations alter the reaction - front dynamics when the diffusion is confined to a percolating cluster in two dimensions  @xcite . in spite of these concerns ,",
    "however , the one - dimensional mean - field model ( [ eq : rho ] ) can in fact describe certain corrosion systems .",
    "an important motivation for the present analytical study is afforded by the recent experiments of lger _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , which are the first to examine in detail the case of one static and one diffusing reactant .",
    "these experiments involve the corrosion of ramified copper electrodeposits exposed to a cupric chloride electrolyte to produce cuprous chloride crystallites via the reaction @xmath51 immediately following electrodeposition .",
    "it is found that the long - time behavior of ( [ eq : rho ] ) with @xmath52 matches the experimentally observed front speed and concentration profile of diffusing reactant ( cucl@xmath53 ) rather well , in spite of the complex fractal geometry of the electrodeposits and the presence of the inert product ( cucl )  @xcite .",
    "since the reaction rate and the concentration of the static species ( cu ) are not directly measured , however , the interpretation of these kinds of corrosion experiments can be aided by the analysis presented here of the mean - field model with @xmath32 .",
    "there is an extensive mathematical literature  @xcite on the subject of single reaction - diffusion equations of the general form @xmath54 which arise in many applications ( e.g. chemical reactions , combustion and population dynamics ) .",
    "a common theme in these studies is the appearance of two distinct ( time - dependent ) length scales in the intermediate asymptotic regime ( @xmath55 ) which correspond to either `` weakly nonlinear behavior '' , where it has been established in many cases that the reaction term is negligible and the dynamics are purely diffusive , or `` strongly nonlinear behavior '' , where the reaction and diffusion terms balance ( in the nomenclature of gmira and veron  @xcite ) .",
    "this separation of scales also arises in coupled systems of reaction - diffusion equations like ( [ eq : coup ] ) , but owing to their greater complexity , much less rigorous analysis has been reported . in the case of two diffusing reactants ,",
    "glfi and rcz  @xcite pointed out that if the diffusion constants are the same , @xmath56 , then the difference in concentrations @xmath57 obeys a pure diffusion equation which can be easily integrated , thereby reducing the coupled system ( [ eq : coup ] ) to a single equation with the form of ( [ eq : single ] ) .",
    "another simplification occurs if also @xmath58 in which case the reaction front is perfectly symmetric and does not move . in this simplified case with @xmath44 , schenkel et al .",
    "@xcite were able to prove that the asymptotic solution of glfi and rcz  @xcite , which combines different approximations at the diffusive and reactive scales , is approached uniformly as @xmath47 starting from the initial conditions of ( [ eq : rhoic ] ) , and they also reported rigorous bounds on the transient decay to the asymptotic solution .",
    "recently , van baalen et al .",
    "@xcite have extended this analysis to the case of symmetric , high - order reactions @xmath59 , where the reaction - front scaling is altered .",
    "the analyses of refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite represent an important contribution because , at least in the case @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , they provide a rigorous mathematical justification for various _ ad hoc _ assumptions introduced by glfi and rcz  @xcite to describe the local structure of the reaction front which have otherwise been validated only by numerical simulations .",
    "unfortunately , however , since the analysis in refs .",
    "@xcite relies on a comparison principle for single parabolic equations  @xcite of the form ( [ eq : single ] ) , it does not ( as the authors indicate ) appear to be applicable when @xmath63 ( which also leads to a moving reaction front ) .",
    "van baalen et al .",
    "@xcite also remark that their analysis is not easily extended to certain intermediate reaction orders ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "these difficulties are reflected in koza s recent studies of the general cases @xmath65  @xcite and @xmath66  @xcite , in which several _ ad hoc _ ( but reasonable ) approximations are made and transients are ignored .    in the present article , the long - time asymptotics of the initial - boundary - value problem ( [ eq : rhobc])([eq : rho ] )",
    "are studied .",
    "this special case of ( [ eq : coup ] ) is more tractable analytically than the general case because ( [ eq : rhob ] ) can be integrated exactly in time , thereby reducing the coupled system to a single integro - partial differential equation .",
    "this useful simplification is presented in section  [ sec : prelim ] where the problem is recast in a dimensionless form .",
    "it is also noted that similarity solutions are expected to exist because there is no natural length or time scale in the problem  @xcite . although it may be possible to prove that the system actually approaches such a self - similar solution starting from the prescribed initial conditions , we instead pursue the more modest goal of proving that if an asymptotic similarity solution exists , it must have a certain unique form , _",
    "i.e. _ we explore the consequences of the `` quasi - stationary approximation ''  @xcite . in section  [ sec : similarity ] , the similarity solution is systematically derived , and it is shown that a diffusion layer  ( where the reaction term is dominated by the diffusion term ) with different scaling properties than the reaction front  ( where the reaction and diffusion terms balance ) must exist to satisfy the boundary conditions . in section  [ sec : transients ] , the transient decay of the reaction rate in the diffusion layer is analyzed , thereby proving _ a posteriori _ that the reaction term can indeed be neglected in the dominant balance . in section  [ sec : uniform ] , a uniformly - valid , asymptotic approximation is constructed by matching the self - similar forms in the two different regions .",

    "@xcite , and consequently in the limit @xmath55 the system is expected to approach an asymptotic similarity solution in which distance and time are coupled by power - law scalings  @xcite . since reactant a diffuses while reactant b does not , the ( presumably unique ) point of maximal reaction rate @xmath114 moves in the @xmath115 direction toward the reservoir of reactant b. therefore , an asymptotic similarity solution , if one exists , must involve a moving frame of reference centered on some point @xmath116 identifying the position of the reaction front at or near the point of maximal reaction rate ( with @xmath117 ) .",

    "the uniform approximation has been determined analytically up to the solution of two algebraic equations ( [ eq : acbc_soln ] ) and one quadrature ( [ eq : hmn ] ) .",
    "a subtle point in the construction of this uniformly valid approximation is that shifting the position of the front by @xmath437 does not affect matching with the diffusion layer because in that case @xmath438 . in other words , because the reaction front is infinitely thin \" compared to the diffusion layer , translating its similarity variable by a constant @xmath263 , or any other function of time that is @xmath439 , does not require that the diffusion - layer similarity variable @xmath197 be shifted as well .",
    "the situation for @xmath78 , the concentration of the static reactant b , is much simpler . by comparing the asymptotic bound on @xmath78 in the diffusion layer given by ( [ eq : blimit ] ) with the tail of the reaction - front approximation given by ( [ eq : bctail ] ) with @xmath368",
    ", we see that that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath78 is identical in the two regions .",
    "therefore , @xmath440 is a uniformly valid approximation , where @xmath144 is the reaction - front similarity function given by ( [ eq : bc_soln ] ) .    at this point",
    "the initial conditions have not yet entered the analysis except in ( [ eq : bint ] ) , which only influences the prefactors of the transient - decay formulae in section  [ sec : transients ] .",
    "therefore , the asymptotic similarity solution is universal up to a constant shift of the reaction front by @xmath263 for some broad set of initial conditions which presumably contains ( [ eq : ic ] ) . in general",
    ", this universality class  of initial conditions leading to the same asymptotic similarity solution ( up to different values of @xmath263 ) is expected to be attained whenever the initial reaction - rate distribution @xmath441 is sufficiently well localized and the reactants are sufficiently well separated .",
    "this class surely contains all initial conditions for which @xmath442 has compact support , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath443 for @xmath444 in ( [ eq : ic ] ) , or exponential decay , _",
    "@xmath445 for some @xmath446 , but perhaps not slower power - law decay .",
    "in this article we have studied the long - time asymptotics of solutions to the initial - boundary - value problem of ( [ eq : rhobc])([eq : rho ] ) , which is a generic mean - field model for the corrosion of a porous solid by a diffusing chemical .",
    "we have derived a uniformly valid asymptotic approximation ( [ eq : a_unif])([eq : b_unif ] ) consisting of matched similarity solutions in two distinct regions , the reaction front and diffusion layer , each possessing different power - law scaling behavior .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of the similarity functions and the scaling exponents have been established if and only if @xmath40 , and through an analysis of transients in the diffusion layer the asymptotic scale separation has been shown to follow from the assumption of quasi - stationarity . since",
    "quasi - stationarity has been observed in recent experiments on the corrosion of ramified electrodeposits  @xcite , the present analysis therefore suffices to establish the theoretical predictions of the mean - field equations for at least one particular corrosion system .",
    "although the case considered here ( @xmath50 , @xmath447 ) is more complicated , it would be useful to perform a rigorous transient analysis along the lines of schenkel _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( who considered only the case @xmath448 , @xmath449 and @xmath44 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we have at least provided a firm mathematical justification for the scale separation between the diffusion layer and reaction front .    in this work",
    "we have paid special attention to the effect of higher - order reactions ( @xmath450 ) .",
    "first of all , the scaling exponents vary with the reaction order @xmath28 of the diffusing reactant in precisely the same way as they do on the sum @xmath451 in the case of two diffusing reactants  @xcite , as shown in table  [ table : exponents ] . moreover , the spatial localization of the reaction rate @xmath452 on each side of the front depends primarily on the reaction order of the depleted reactant : as the appropriate reaction order is increased from unity , the spatial dependence of the reaction rate away from the front changes from an exponential decay to a progressively broader power - law decay .",
    "similarly , the temporal decay of the depleted ( static ) reactant concentration in the diffusion layer depends sensitively on its reaction order , undergoing a transition from exponential to power - law decay ( in time ) as @xmath29 is increased from unity .",
    "these properties may have general relevance for more complicated multi - component reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "other qualitiative features of our analysis that might have more general applicability are the dominant balances in the reaction front , where the concentration of a diffusing reactant is determined by a balance between reactions and steady state \" diffusion , _",
    "i.e. _ a mobile species diffuses slowly to the front where it immediately reacts . on the other hand ,",
    "the concentration of a static reactant is determined by a balance between reactions and fictitous advection due to the moving reference frame , _",
    "i.e. _ since the static species can not diffuse to the front , the front must diffuse to it .",
    "these guiding principles might help simplify more complicated reaction - diffusion equations for which asymptotically self - similar solutions do not exist .",
    "after the writing of this article , a referee pointed out some interesting similarities between our analysis of chemical reaction fronts and various existing studies in combustion theory  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the equations for combustion waves introduced by zeldovich and frank - kamenetzki  @xcite , which have since been generalized by many authors ( e.g. matkowsky and sivashinsky  @xcite ) , bear some resemblance to ( [ eq : coup ] ) since they describe the diffusion of a fuel substance coupled to the diffusion of heat . in combustion theory , however , the usual reaction term is quite different from ( [ eq : rpower ] ) because it involves exponential arrhenius temperature dependence , and the initial and boundary conditions also differ from those considered here . as a result",
    ", combustion waves tend to exhibit qualitatively different behavior from reaction - diffusion fronts .",
    "( for example , simple flame fronts have constant width and constant velocity . ) nevertheless , combustion waves exhibit multiple scales analogous to the reaction - front and diffusion layers described here , which have also been analyzed using matched asymptotic expansions  @xcite ( although not in the dynamical setting of this work ) .",
    "the idea of matching derivatives between the inner and outer regions actually appears to have its origin in the pioneering paper of zeldovich and frank - kamenetzki  @xcite , in which the velocity of a simple flame front is determined by analyzing a single - component equation like ( [ eq : single ] ) . in hindsight , it is somewhat surprising that the recent parallel literatures on two - species reaction - diffusion fronts and combustion waves have developed quite independently of each other , without any cross - references ( at least , none to our knowledge ) .",
    "it is hoped , therefore , that this paper will initiate the `` diffusion '' of ideas between these two mature but related disciplines .",
