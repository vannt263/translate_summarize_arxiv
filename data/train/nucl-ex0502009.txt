    "the azimuthal anisotropy of particle emission is a powerful tool to study the early stage of ultra - relativistic nuclear collisions .",
    "the spatial anisotropy in the initial stage of non - central nucleus - nucleus collisions is transferred into momentum anisotropy in the final state .",
    "the azimuthal anisotropy is defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a normalization constant , @xmath8 is the azimuthal angle of particles , and @xmath9 is the direction of the nuclear impact parameter ( `` reaction plane '' ) in a given collision .",
    "the harmonic coefficients , @xmath10 , indicate the strength of the @xmath11 anisotropy .",
    "the azimuthal anisotropy parameter @xmath0 ( the second harmonic coefficient of the fourier expansion of the azimuthal distribution ) may be especially sensitive to the early pressure @xcite .",
    "the transverse momentum ( @xmath5 ) dependence of @xmath0 has been measured for identified particles at rhic @xcite .",
    "previous measurements are limited to hadrons made of light quarks .",
    "these results show a clear mass dependence of @xmath0 , which is well reproduced by a hydrodynamical calculation @xcite in the low @xmath5 region ( @xmath12 2 gev/@xmath13 ) . the agreement is considered as evidence that the collective motion develops in the very early stages of the reaction .",
    "it is also observed that @xmath0 as a function of @xmath5 scales via the coalescence prescription , that is , @xmath14 as a function of @xmath15 is universal , where @xmath16 is the number of valence quarks plus valence anti - quarks .",
    "this scaling behavior is consistent with the prediction of the quark coalescence model , which assumes a finite @xmath0 of quarks @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath0 already develops in the partonic phase for hadrons made of light quarks .",
    "in addition , if the @xmath0 of heavy quarks is non - zero , it would support partonic level thermalization and very high density at the early stage of the collisions .",
    "electrons are a useful tool to study the production of heavy quarks such as charm quarks . in the phenix experiment at rhic , transverse momentum spectra of single electrons",
    "have been measured in au+au collisions at @xmath2 = 130 gev @xcite and 200 gev @xcite .",
    "the results are consistent with that expected from semileptonic charm decays in addition to decays of light mesons and photon conversions @xcite . on the other hand , electrons originating from semileptonic decays of @xmath17 mesons have a significant angular deviation from the original @xmath17 meson direction .",
    "the effect for @xmath0 has been studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the results suggest that the effect is not significant for the decay electron @xmath0 , and the electron @xmath0 reflects the @xmath0 of @xmath17 meson .",
    "therefore the single electron @xmath0 measurement is a useful method for studying open charm @xmath0 .",
    "currently the single electron spectra from phenix are consistent with two opposing scenarios : ( 1 ) initial perturbative qcd charm production without final state interactions and ( 2 ) complete thermal equilibrium for charmed hadrons @xcite .",
    "therefore the measurement of the azimuthal anisotropy of electrons from semileptonic charm decays could give us important new information regarding the charm dynamics in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the measurement is also important for the quark coalescence model due to the large difference between the charm quark and light quark masses , and for the prediction of @xmath0 for the @xmath18 and the @xmath17 meson , which contain charm quarks .    in this paper , we present the first measurement of the single electron @xmath0 , which is expected to reflect the heavy flavor azimuthal anisotropy , below 4 gev/@xmath13 with respect to the reaction plane in au+au collisions at @xmath2 = 200 gev .",
