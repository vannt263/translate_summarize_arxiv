    "to determine the evolution of the hi content of galaxies as a function of redshift is a very important input into the understanding of the history of gas content and star formation in the universe . while the study of damped lyman - alpha clouds in absorption gives the evolution of the aggregate hi content in the redshift range @xmath9 ( prochaska et  al .",

    "one possible approach to detect hi in emission at high redshifts rests on the detection of the fluctuation in the redshifted hi emission from high redshifts ( bharadwaj & sethi 2001 ; chang et  al .",
    "2008 , bharadwaj et  al .",
    "recently the first detection of hi at @xmath14 was reported based on cross - correlating the density field of optically - selected galaxies with known redshifts from the deep2 survey with the redshifted hi emission ( chang et  al .",
    "this cross - correlation is non - zero only if hi is associated with galaxies observed by the deep2 survey ; or this method detects the component of hi correlated with the deep2 galaxies .",
    "more recently , a detection at @xmath15 was reported based on the cross - correlation with wigglez galaxies ( masui et  al .",

    "detailed n - body simulations ( khandai et  al . 2011 ) showed that results of chang et  al ( 2010 ) can be consistently reproduced within the framework of density evolution in the standard @xmath16cdm model .",
    "these simulations could estimate the possible range of bias and stochasticity of the hi density field , which are degenerate with the total hi content in the observation of chang et  al .",

    "these simulations also showed that stacking of hi 21 cm - line emission from galaxies of known redshifts can lead to a detailed reconstruction of the properties of hi halos at @xmath17 .",
    "it was argued that gmrt could play an important role in this study both owing to its frequency coverage as well as its field of view .    in this letter",
    "we report gmrt observations of one of the deep2 fields and attempt to estimate the hi content of the universe at @xmath7 using stacking of the spectra at the locations of the deep2 galaxies .    throughout this paper",

    "this field contains the minimum number of bright radio sources within the primary beams ( full width at half maximum @xmath24 44@xmath23 ) of the gmrt antennas at 610 mhz .",
    "this will ensure that the images are least affected by dynamic range limitations of gmrt . in any case",
    ", dynamic range limitations will be minimal since this is a spectral line observation .",

    "the desired velocity resolution is @xmath26 to detect signals with an expected width @xmath27 .",

    "the velocity width of @xmath24 30 km s@xmath28 corresponds to a channel width of @xmath24 60 khz at 610 mhz .",
    "based on the distribution of deep2 galaxies in right ascension and declination and in the redshift space , and taking into account the optimum range of frequencies for observations in the 610 mhz band , a frequency range of 601 to 633 mhz was selected .",
    "this frequency range corresponds to deep2 sources in the redshift range @xmath1 , distributed over the range of right ascensions @xmath29 , and declinations @xmath30 .",
    "this region of 79@xmath31 33@xmath32 was covered in two gmrt pointings , the primary beams ( fwhm ) of the gmrt dishes being @xmath24 44@xmath32 .",
    "each of these pointings were observed for a total of 12 hr with a bandwidth of 32 mhz and 512 channels .",

    "one of the two 12 hour pointings was completely analysed and is discussed below .",
    "corrupted data due to non - working antennas and baselines and due to the radio frequency interference were flagged using different tasks in the astronomical image processing software ( aips ) .",
    "the data quality was good with less than 10 % of the data being flagged .",
    "a multi - channel continuum data set ( 32 channels ) was formed from the spectral line data ( 512 channels ) by averaging over 16  channels .",
    "this continuum data set was used to produce the best continuum images of this field .",
    "the continuum images so obtained had an rms value of 85 @xmath33jy / beam for a circular synthesised beam of 10@xmath34 .",
    "this image is dynamic range limited at a value @xmath24 3200 , as is usually the case with most gmrt continuum images .",
    "the gain ( complex ) solutions obtained above were transferred to the spectral line data set .",
    "the continuum in the spectral line data was subtracted in two steps .",
    "first , the continuum source components that made the best continuum images were subtracted from the spectral line data set ( task uvsub in aips ) .",
    "second , a second - order base line across frequencies was fit to the resulting spectral line data set and was subtracted from the spectral line data set ( task uvlsf in aips ) .",
    "this procedure yielded a continuum - free data set which was analysed for spectral features . a spectral line image cube ( 512 channels ) with a spatial resolution of 10@xmath35 and a spectral resolution of 30.7 km s@xmath28 was produced .",
    "this spectral line image cube has an rms of 260 @xmath33jy / beam / channel , close to the expected value of @xmath24 200 @xmath33jy / beam / channel .",
    "from the image cube , we extract spectra at the positions of deep2 sources in the field of view .",
    "we then shift and add the spectra centered at the respective redshifts of the deep2 sources . in this procedure ,",
    "we retain 50 channels on either side of the center of addition .",
    "if a source lies within 50 channels from the edges of the cube , it is excluded from the analysis .",
    "this process retains 489 sources out of a total of 539 for the entire field of view .",
    "we also apply primary beam correction to the image cube .",
    "this process increases the noise and the source flux away from the phase center .",
    "for the primary beam corrected cube , we retain sources only within 30% of the primary beam .",
    "there are 389 sources in this angular area and the procedure of coadding yields 371 sources .",
    "we present results from both the primary - beam uncorrected and the primary - beam corrected cubes . to take into account this variation in the noise properties we coadd signal with both uniform and optimal weighting . in optimal weighting",
    ", the spectra are coadded with weights inversely proportional to the square of the noise in each spectra .",
    "the uniform weighting gives us an unbiased estimate of the signal ( average peak flux of the halos ) and allow us to compare the flux with theoretical estimates .",
    "the optimal weighting maximizes the signal - to - noise of the detection but constitutes a biased estimate of the signal .",
    "the estimated signal strength in the three cases can be written as : @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the signal at the position of deep2 galaxies ; @xmath38 is the noise in the spectrum at the position of deep2 galaxies , and @xmath39 corresponds to the primary beam correction at the location of the galaxy .",
    "the primary beam uncorrected analysis allows us to study the noise characteristics of the cube , while the corrected cases gives us a realistic estimate of the strength of the spectral line .    in figure  1",
    ", we show the coadded raw spectrum and the 7-channel running average spectrum , from the primary beam uncorrected and the primary beam corrected image cubes .",
    "in this paper we aim to measure the line flux and its velocity width of the stacked hi signal . in a detailed n - body simulation ,",
    "khandai et al .",
    "( 2011 ) constructed several models of hi distribution at @xmath17 and computed the stacked spectra .",
    "all these models were normalized to the cumulative hi content @xmath40 as estimated by absorption studies , but were based on a range of hi mass functions , and therefore differed in emission properties of the signal .",
    "the stacked spectra obtained from these models show a peak flux between 1030@xmath33jy and velocity widths in the range 500 - 1000@xmath41 .    to extract the relevant information from the coadded signal , we average the signal with three velocity widths .",
    "figure  2 shows the coadded spectra averaged over 9 points every 10th channel .",
    "each of the nine points on the red ( dashed ) curve in the figure corresponds to signal added for @xmath42 for @xmath43 running from 0 and 8 ; the velocity width of the nine point averaging is @xmath44 .",
    "figure  3 and  4 show the signal averaged over 19  channels ( @xmath45 for i from 0 to 4 ; velocity width @xmath46 ) and 29  channels ( @xmath47 , velocity width @xmath48 ) , respectively .",
    "the choice of these three velocity averaging schemes allows us to estimate the velocity width of the central enhancement and also gauge the contribution of residual continuum and systematics on the wings of the line .    as noted above we present analysis of three different cubes of estimating the coadded signal ( eq  1 ) .",
    "the interpretation of the signal in the three cases needs to be discussed . in the primary beam uncorrected case ,",
    "the signal is dominated by halos close to the primary beam phase center . in the primary beam",
    "corrected uniform - weighting all the halos receive equal weight . in the optimal - weighing case ,",
    "the signal is dominated by halos closer to the primary beam phase center as the halo flux is weighted as the square of the inverse of the noise which increases away from the phase center when the primary beam correction is made .",
    "this also means that one generically expects the signal in this case to be closer to the estimate of the primary beam uncorrected case , as we also find .",
    "it should be noted that the optimal case also give us an unbiased estimate of the signal if the hi signal from all the haloes is the same .",
    "the signal strengths obtained for varying velocity widths using three different data cubes are given in table  1 .",
    "we adopt three different methods for estimating the error on the signal strength .    * the most obvious method to make an estimate of the error on the signal is to estimate the rms of the coadded signal ( figure  1 ) after appropriate velocity averaging ( table  1 ) .",
    "while this is the simplest approach to computing the error on the signal , it has severe limitations .",
    "for a nine - point average , we are left with only nine points to compute the signal and the noise ; we do not quote this number for the other two velocity averaged spectra . * we scramble the redshifts of deep2 galaxies and adopt the same procedure for coadding the spectra as outlined above ( 9 , 19 , 29-point averaged , red , dashed curve in figure  2 , 3 , and  4 ) .",
    "+ this procedure randomizes galaxy positions ( in redshift space ) and therefore should yield a null result ; it can also act to suppress systematics in the original coadded spectra .",
    "we use this bootstrapping procedure to obtain 180200 different realizations of the spectrum ( 20 , 40 , 60 realizations of 9- , 19- and 29- channel averaged spectra , each containing 9 , 5 , or 3 points ) , which enables us to obtain an estimate of the error in the signal .",
    "we check for convergence in each case .",
    "+ for instance , in figure  2 , we show the average and rms for 9  spectral point for 20 realizations obtained by scrambling deep2 galaxy redshifts .",
    "as all these spectral points are equivalent we could use all the 180 points to compute the error on the signal strength .",
    "using all the 180 spectral points , we obtain an rms of ( 4.3,10 , 4.1 )  @xmath33jy from these spectra for the primary beam uncorrected and corrected ( uniform and optimal ) cubes , respectively ( table  1 ) .",
    "similar procedure is applicable for the other two velocity widths and the relevant results for these cases are shown in figure  3 and  4 and table  1 .",
    "+ the bootstrapping procedure described above acts to redistribute line flux across the entire data and while this suppresses the central enhancement it could also create a small line - flux bias which results in non - zero average for the coadded spectrum .",
    "the strength of this bias can be computed : as noted above we do not source lying within 50 channels on either side of spectrum , which leaves us with 412 spectral channels .",
    "we randomize the redshift of the object for each spectra and follow the coadding process .",
    "the number of sources is @xmath49 and the average line flux is @xmath50jy with a velocity width corresponding to 20 channels ( e.g. figure  3 ) .",
    "this flux is redistributed across @xmath51 channels , which results in the maximum line - flux bias of @xmath52jy for the entire cube .",
    "+ the probability of the scrambled signal to exceed the central enhancement is another indicator of the significance of the detection .",
    "however , when the number of realizations exceed the total number of data points the spectral channels get correlated and we do not get independent information of this significance .",
    "the total number of data points is the number of velocity - averaged spectral points for one spectrum multiplied by the the number of sources , which gives roughly 10000 , 5000 , and 3000 data points for the 9- , 19- and 29-channel averaging .",
    "when the number of realizations exceed these numbers we get spectral correlation , which prevents a statistical interpretation of our results .",
    "this also means that this procedure can not give more than a 3.5@xmath6 detection ( for a normal distribution ) .",
    "+ this procedure gives us another measure of the significance of the signal .",
    "we run a large number of realizations ( over 1000 ) to understand the nature of the signal in each case .",
    "our findings are in broad agreement with the results shown in table  1 : ( a ) an increase in signal - to - noise for optimal weighting ( we did not find a single instance in which the bootstrapped signal exceeded the central enhancement in such cases ) , ( b ) the signal - to - noise is maximum for 19-channel averaging case , ( c ) for cases where the signal - to - noise is expected to be smaller than 3@xmath6 , e.g. primary beam corrected , 29-channel averaged case , the results from this procedure are in agreement with table  1 . * the methods ( a ) and ( b ) do not take into account the noise properties of the whole data cube , which could be affected by other systematics . to determine the level of homogeneity of noise along lines of sights that do not contain deep2 sources ( blank positions ) , we use the data along 40000 lines of sights towards these blank positions .",
    "these blank positions are randomly chosen and are separated from the positions of deep2 sources by more than a few synthesized beams .",
    "these spectra can be used to obtain many realizations of coadded spectra for the required number of sources .",
    "we apply exactly the same coaddition procedure on a set containing 500 such spectra as for the spectra containing the deep2 galaxies .",
    "we thus obtain 80 realizations of such coadded data sets towards blank positions , which are shown in figure  5 .",
    "+ the average rms of these raw spectra is @xmath53jy ; the error on this rms is @xmath54jy .",
    "the small error on the rms shows that the noise properties of the data cube are stable and robust .",
    "+ the average rms for the 9 , 19 , and 29  channel averaged spectra is @xmath55jy , respectively ( table  1 ) .",
    "+ information from blank positions can be used to estimate the level of significance of the detection in the direction of deep2 galaxies .",
    "we estimate the probability for the signal ( for 9- , 19- , or 29-channel averaging ) in the blank positions to exceed the central enhancement detected in the direction of deep2 galaxies .",
    "we find this probability to lie between 0.010.03 for the three cases of channel averaging .",
    "it is lowest for the 29-channel average and is comparable for the other two cases .",
    "the estimated probability correspond to between 2 - 2.5@xmath6 detection of the signal for the primary beam uncorrected cube . + this procedure can not be used for the primary beam corrected cube as the noise increases away from the pointing center and therefore is not homogeneous across the cube .",
    "the results are displayed in table  1 and figure  2 , 3 ,  4 can be briefly summarized as : ( a ) the signal strength is almost the same for both 9 and 19 channel averages but it falls for 29 channel average ; 30% fall in the signal suggests the signal peaks within a velocity width of @xmath46 ( 19-channel average ) , but there is detectable flux for velocity width @xmath56 .",
    "( b ) the maximum signal - to - noise is obtained for the velocity width @xmath57 , ( c ) residual flux is seen on the wings of the coadded spectra in almost all cases , in particular in the primary - beam corrected cases .    it is conceivable that the presence of residual flux is owing to the width of the signal being wider than @xmath58 , even though it is not supported by simulations ( khandai et  al 2011 ) .",
    "however , this hypothesis is less tenable because we do not see significant flux for the primary - beam uncorrected case , even though the central enhancement is prominent .",
    "a more likely hypothesis is that the residual flux in the line wings has other origins : ( a ) presence of unsubtracted continuum , ( b ) systematics in spectral domain picked while correcting for the primary beam and possible edge effects .",
    "the impact of edge effects is seen in figure  1 and also slightly discordant first and final channel fluxes for the three different velocity - averaged spectra ( figures  24 ) . for 9- .",
    "19- , and 29-channel averages we use channels : 1090 , 397 , 793 .",
    "we detect some edge effects which are seen in particular in the 19-channel averaging which uses information from channels closer to the edge .",
    "we consider the 29-channel averaged spectrum to estimate the level of continuum residual and systematics in the coadded spectra .",
    "the average flux of all the channels except the central channel ( average over @xmath59 channel ) is : ( 0 , 10 , 6.7 )  @xmath33jy for the primary - beam uncorrected , corrected , and optimal case , respectively .",
    "the bootstrapping method redistributes the line flux and also serves to remove systematics but it leaves the level of continuum unchanged .",
    "therefore , the average of bootstrapped spectral points gives us an estimate of the level of residual continuum ( figure  3 ) ; this average is : ( 1.4 , 4.4 , 1.7 )  @xmath33jy for the primary - beam uncorrected , corrected , and optimal case , respectively .",
    "it follows that the level of flux in the line wings is more than the residual continuum .",
    "as already noted above , the primary - beam uncorrected cube has relatively low levels of flux on the wings and the subtraction of residual continuum flux removes the flux on the wings below 1@xmath6 ( table  1 ) .",
    "however , in the primary beam corrected uniform and optimal - weighing cases the average flux on the wings is still significant , which tends to suggest detectable flux even in the line wings at 1.52@xmath6 levels .",
    "for instance , we compute the probability of the flux level seen in the line wings in the highest signal - to - noise case : 19-channel averaged cube weighted optimally ( figure  3 ) by using bootstrapping method , we find the probability to be @xmath60 , roughly corresponding to a 2@xmath6 detection .",
    "however , the analysis of the primary beam uncorrected case clearly suggests that the line wing flux is attributable to a mix of residual continuum flux and systematics .",
    "the presence of systematics is also seen in the asymmetrical shape of the lines .    to get a conservative estimate of the signal",
    ", we assume that there is no flux in the cube for velocity widths exceeding the 29-channel average , and remove the flux in the line wings estimated from the 29-channel averaged spectra from all the channels in the corresponding cubes .",
    "the error on the central enhancement is obtained by the bootstrapping method ( table  1 ) .",
    "our final results are shown in figure  6 for all the cases and they can be summarized as :    * the signal - to - noise is maximum for the 19-channel averaging case and it lies in the range @xmath61 . * the signal - to - noise is the lowest for the 29-channel averaging case and is in the range @xmath62 . *",
    "as expected , the signal - to - noise is maximum for the optimally - weighted case .",
    "we can directly compare our results with the simulations of khandai et  al .",
    "their results showed that the stacked signal could have peak strength varying between 1030  @xmath33jy and velocity width in the range @xmath63 ( figure  5 of their paper ) .",
    "khandai et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) considered many models , for the global hi content corresponding to @xmath64 , to represent the hi content of the deep2 galaxies at @xmath17 , based on different mass cuts on the dark matter haloes ( e.g. figure  7 of their paper ) .",
    "our results are in agreement with their model  2 and  3 , corresponding to a mass cut - off on the dark matter haloes in the range @xmath65 . for these model ,",
    "the line flux peaks in the range @xmath66jy and falls by roughly a factor of 10 within a velocity width of @xmath67 from the line center .",
    "this also means that the hi mass function at @xmath17 is more skewed towards the higher mass end as compared to the @xmath12 mass function ( zwaan et  al . 2005 ) ; for detailed discussion , see khandai et  al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "uncertainties in the estimate of hi content of the universe at @xmath17 partly arises from the fact that at this redshift the lyman-@xmath68 line is not directly accessible to ground based telescopes . at this redshift",
    ", the determination of the global hi content is enabled by hst observations , observation of associated mgii absorbers ( rao et  al .",
    "2006 ) , the detection of hi in absorption against bright radio sources ( kanekar et  al . 2009 ) and , more recently , through the cross - correlation of optical galaxies with redshifted hi emission ( chang et  al .",
    "all these methods yield the hi content of the universe at @xmath17 , @xmath69 is roughly constant up to @xmath70 ( noterdaeme et  al . 2012 ,",
    "rao et  al 2006 ) .",
    "our result can potentially be interpreted in two possible ways : either the value of @xmath40 is higher than indicated by absorption studies or the deep2 galaxies provide a data set biased towards higher hi masses .",
    "the simulations of pontzen et al.(2008 ) suggest that damped lyman-@xmath68 systems are housed in dark matter halos of masses smaller than @xmath71 ; from the measurement of mass - to - light ratio of deep2 galaxies , these galaxies are in dark matter halos almost an order of magnitude more massive , ( khandai et  al .",
    "2011 , figure  6 ) .",
    "alternatively , the mass function of the hi halos is tilted towards higher masses as compared to low redshifts . as noted above",
    ", a comparison of our results with the simulations of khandai et  al ( 2011 ) , suggests that our results can be interpreted as arising from a hi mass distribution skewed towards the higher mass end , without invoking any enhancement in the global hi content .",
    "however , it is possible that the result could be partially owing to the uncertainty in the hi content at @xmath7 .    in conclusion :",
    "we report the first tentative detection of hi at @xmath7 .",
    "our results are based on gmrt observation of deep2 fields and the coaddition of the signals at the locations of these galaxies .",
    "if confirmed , this would be the highest redshift at which the hi has been detected in emission .",
