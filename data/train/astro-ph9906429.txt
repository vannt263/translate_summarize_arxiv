    "is one of the a type stars showing a high infrared excess ( @xmath3 / @xmath4 ) due to the thermal emission from dust .",
    "the excess is twice that of , the best studied case among vega - like stars so far .",
    "the star age , 8@xmath52myr @xcite , is about 5 to 15 times less than  implying that  is tracing an evolutionary phasis prior to that of .",
    "@xcite and @xcite resolved first the  dust at thermal infrared wavelengths ( @xmath6 m ) recently followed by @xcite in scattered light ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 m ) .",
    "interestingly , the disk lies nearly in the direction to , a physically bound companion of  @xcite , located 7.7 \" away , _",
    "i.e. _ 515au in projected distance according to the _ hipparcos _ star distance @xmath9pc .    according to the resolved images , the disk is extending only a few tens of au outside the peak of the dust distribution assessed to about 70au @xcite .",
    "outer truncation of circumstellar disks within a binary system has been predicted at typical distances of 1/3  1/2 of the binary separation @xcite .",
    "however , the impact of the companion  on the disk extension is still unclear .    in the inner part of the disk , @xcite",
    "first suggested a depletion of dust close to the star so as to reproduce the 110k color temperature deduced from iras data .",
    "the comparison between resolved mid - ir images and first order modeling ( see below ) confirmed the necessity of an inner hole in the disk at 55@xmath515au from the star for @xcite and 60@xmath520au for @xcite .    according to @xcite ,",
    "a second population of hotter grains may however lie closer to the star ( inside the inner hole ) .",
    "located at distances similar to those of the zodiacal dust in our solar system , this dust population would be responsible for both the 12.5@xmath1 m detected excess and for a faint emission at 20.8@xmath1 m ( less than 10% of the total flux at the wavelenght ) in excess of the resolved disk and centered on the star .",
    "the grains properties are so far poorly constrained .",
    "according to @xcite , grains smaller than about 3@xmath1 m are blown outward by radiation pressure . considering the poynting - robertson effect , they found that the grains are probably larger than 40@xmath1 m under the assumption of a 40au inner hole .",
    "@xcite used thermal absorption / emission laws for the grains following the model proposed by @xcite for  : @xmath10 is constant for @xmath11 and proportionnal to @xmath12 otherwise , the parameter @xmath13 is expected to be related to an effectif grain size @xmath14 in the disk .",
    "although @xcite constrain @xmath13 to 25@xmath515@xmath1 m , they do not specify the ratio @xmath15 in the case of .",
    "this ratio could vary by a factor 40 between the lower and the higher value @xcite .    before beeing imaged in the mid - ir spectral range ,",
    "no optical or near - ir observations succesfully resolved the disk around , if we except for a slight asymmetry in the coronographic adaptive optics system images performed with the eso adaptive optics system in k band @xcite .",
    "because of the low signal to noise ratio in this data , these results were not presented as a positive detection .",
    "knowing the position angle of the disk , we reduced again these observations and we now marginally detect the disk . after a brief summary of thermal available data , we present in section [ secdata ] the newly reduced scattered light images and compare then with more recent and better signal to noise ratio scattered ligth images @xcite .",
    "as data become actually more numerous , we wish to better constrain the grain properties in the  disk .",
    "sophisticated grains models developed by @xcite succeeded both in reproducing interstellar observations ( extinction , polarization @xcite ) and in fitting the shape of the sed of the disk surounding  @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite proposed a link between ism particles and evolved environments assuming that dust grains in the  disk are of cometary origin ( see also @xcite ) and could be fluffy aggregates of primitive interstellar dust .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt a similar approach for the grains in the  disk .",
    "we describe section [ secmodel ] the disk model assumptions and try to fit ( sections [ single ] and [ double ] ) the spectral energy distribution ( hereafter sed ) to derive some physical and chemical grain properties such as typical size , porosity , presence of ice and finally to estimate if the grains are more similar to interstellar dust grains or to comet - like grains .",
    "in addition , we test whether the presence of a second population responsible for the 10@xmath1 m excesses is necessary or not . given the constraints on the grain distribution derived from the sed fitting , we try to reproduce the thermal and scattered light resolved images ( section [ images ] ) .",
    "we finally discuss section [ discuss ] the implications on the disk dynamics .",
    "the available photometric data for the  disk are summarized in table [ data ] .",
    "they include color - corrected iras measurements , irtf bolometer measurements @xcite , keck / mirlin @xcite and cerro tololo/ oscir @xcite images and the irtf bolometer datum obtained by @xcite at 20@xmath1 m .",
    "they also include the available submillimeter data  : jcmt upper limit at 800@xmath1 m @xcite and recent scuba measurements at 450@xmath1 m and 850@xmath1 m @xcite .",

    "[ cols=\">,^,^,^ \" , ]     collisions are then the dominant process in the cold annulus .",
    "the smallest grains produced by collisions in very short time - scales are not efficiently removed from the ring by poynting - robertson drag .",
    "only radiation pressure is then able to explain the minimum grain size ( @xmath17 m ) derived from the sed fitting . also",
    ", this is consistent with the fact that this minimum grain size is very close to the blow - out size limit .",
    "of course , this argument applies only if the gas does not play an important role , as suggested in a previous subsection ( [ gdratio ] ) . at 70au from the star ,",
    "the h@xmath18o ice within the smallest grains is sublimated in a short time - scale in comparison with the star age .",
    "this is consistent with the little percentage of h@xmath18o ice required to fit the 20  25@xmath1 m sed ( subsection [ cold ] ) .",
    "the hot dust population is poorly constrained ; the time - scales in table [ times ] have then to be taken with care .",
    "the life time of the @xmath19 m crystalline grains under poynting - robertson drag is long compared to the collision time - scale , and even @xmath20 m crystalline grains with @xmath21 have @xmath22 about 4 times larger than @xmath23 .",
    "also , collisions and radiation pressure are probably the two main processes which shape the hot dust distribution .",
    "we here consider the implications of the model parameters for the ring centred at @xmath24au given in table [ 3.5outersed ] . as representative example",
    "we consider model * # 13*. this has a total grain surface density @xmath25grains.@xmath26 .",
    "for the assumed size distribution ( @xmath27 ) , the mean collision time for the smallest grains with @xmath28 m is approximately @xmath29yr .",
    "as these grains are at the radiation pressure blow out limit and the majority of grains have the minimum size , the minimum mass loss rate is given by  : @xmath30 where @xmath31@xmath32 is the area of the annulus .",
    "for model * # 13 * this corresponds to @xmath33yr@xmath34 .",
    "thus the dust mass reservoir required to supply this mass loss over the age of the system is @xmath35 which corresponds to a surface density in solids @xmath36g.@xmath26 .",
    "it is of interest to note that if we assume a gas to dust ratio of @xmath37 in the primordial nebulae , this corresponds to a surface density @xmath38 for the original protostellar disk .",
    "this surface density is consistent with that expected at @xmath39au for standard disk models corresponding to a minimum mass solar nebula ( e.g. papaloizou & terquem 1999 ) .",
    "if the surface density @xmath40 resides predominantly in objects with @xmath41 m , their collision time would be @xmath42yr .",
    "this is still shorter than the age of the system . with a ring aspect ratio of @xmath43 for instance",
    ", collisions are expected to occur with a relative velocity @xmath44km.s@xmath34 , and are likely to be destructive . in order to have a collisional lifetime greater than the star age , the objects would have to have @xmath45 larger than about @xmath37 m .",
    "a population of such larger objects providing a mass source for those with @xmath46 m , may exist but they would not be detectable . in that case",
    "the disk mass could be significantly larger than @xmath47 .      in the standard model of planetary formation @xcite , objects in the size range @xmath48 m ",
    "@xmath48 km are formed by accumulation of smaller objects through collisions when there was still gas present .",
    "the presence of gas drag , effective enough here with @xmath49g.@xmath26 , would be essential to damp eccentricity and inclination so collisions occur with small relative velocity",
    ". however , the collision timescales would be the same as estimated above .",
    "thus it is reasonable that objects as large as @xmath50 m could be formed if the gas residence time was similar to the present age of the system .",
    "when significant amount of gas was present during earlier phases , the disk would be expected to be thin because of gas drag @xcite but this could have been thickenned due to gravitational perturbations from large external objects .",
    "unfortunately the observations are not yet able to provide contraints on the vertical thickness , but this does not affect the discussion about mass loss rates or collision times because these are independent of the vertical thickness .      the fact that the mass distribution in the ring is tightly radially confined to a width of about @xmath51 times the mean radius , which may be comparable to its vertical thickness , gravitational confinement mechanisms may operate to sculpt its form .",
    "as it is likely that many collisions are required to reduce a metre sized object to fragments small enough to be blown out by radiation pressure , if the the vertical thickness is as much as @xmath52 , the ring should be significantly wider without a confinement mechanism .",
    "even if the ring is very thin as it might have been immediately post formation so that little collisional spreading occurs , a mechanism is still required to explain why the protostellar gaseous disk was truncated at around 70au .",
    "confinement may occur through gravitational interaction with external perturbers .",
    "this situation is familiar in the case of planetary rings @xcite where the interaction with external orbiting satellites provides confinement .",
    "it also occurs for accretion disks in close binary systems where interaction with a binary companion truncates the disk @xcite .",
    "the presence of a binary companion in the system discussed here is suggestive that it could play a role in determining the location of the outer boundary to the disk as well as pumping up inclinations after gas dispersal .",
    "note also that an exterior as yet undetected giant planet might provide a similar role .",
    "the binary companion  is seen at a projected distance of @xmath53au from the central star whereas the outer disk radius is @xmath39au .",
    "thus if it is to play any role in confinement the orbit should be eccentric .",
    "as significant interaction with the ring requires the pericentre distance to be less than three times the ring radius , the minimum value for the eccentricity is thus @xmath54 , although it could be significantly larger on account of projection effects .",
    "disk edge truncation can be effective in the presence of binary companions with significant mass ratio in circular or eccentric orbits . in the case of very eccentric orbits , as may well be the case here , the truncation process is most easily modelled as a succession of encounters which occur at each pericentre passage @xcite . from these studies",
    "it is clear that in order to be truncated , the disk radius should initially exceed about one third of pericentre distance .",
    "material beyond this radius is strongly perturbed and removed from the disk which develops a truncated edge there .",
    "the latter phenomenon , which occurs because of angular momentum transported from the disk to the companion , was seen in the gas disk simulations of @xcite and the free particle simulations of @xcite and is also expected for the disks of the type considered here .",
    "we propose a two dust populations model able to reproduce all the available observations of the  disk .",
    "the first dust population , peaked at 70au from the star , shapes like a narrow annulus .",
    "its small radial extension suggests a gravitational confinement mechanism both outside and inside the peak at 70au .",
    "this ring is made of amorphous grains quite similar to those found in the interstellar medium . under the assumption of a collisionnal grain size distribution , grains larger than @xmath17 m to meter sized bodies",
    "are required to fit the data .",
    "collisions , occuring in short time scales , are expected to produce smallest grains down to the blow out size limit ( @xmath55 m ) .",
    "this conclusion applies because of the gas to dust ratio smaller than 1 inferred .",
    "the second dust population at 9 - 10au from the star is made of comet - like grains .",
    "higher signal to noise ratio measurements and resolved images at @xmath56 m would allow to better constrain this dust population ( spatial extension , grain size range ) and its dynamics .    the dust surrounding  probably shows an intermediate stage for the  matter between pre - main sequence stars and evolved ones like , fomalhaut , vega , 55cnc  the presence of a companion ( ) is also an interesting peculiarity among the vega - like stars . as a large number of field stars",
    "are members of binary ( or more ) systems ,  does not represent a marginal case .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of the disk has to be further studied , in terms of chemical evolution of the grains and dust distribution to better understand the steps which lead or not to planetary systems formation .",
    "we wish to thank g. schneider and j.s .",
    "greaves for providing data prior to publication and s. warren for providing water ice optical constants .",
    "we also thank herv beust for helpfull discussions on the dynamics of the system .",
