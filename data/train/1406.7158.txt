    "we prove a strong form of model completeness for some expansions of the field of real numbers by modular functions and forms and also by universal families of elliptic functions .",
    "this type of result was first proved for expansions of the field of real numbers by real analytic functions restricted to the product of intervals by jan denef and lou van den dries in @xcite ( this structure is now called @xmath4 ) , by lou van den dries for expansions by the restricted sine and exponential functions in @xcite and by the author for expansions by restricted weierstrass @xmath3 and abelian functions in @xcite .",
    "these results depend , among other things , on the fact that the functions used in the definition of the structures are analytic at the boundary ( or at infinity ) .",

    "in their paper they also have shown that the modular function @xmath5 is also definable in @xmath4 .",
    "their results ( and some others discussed in the section _ concluding remarks _ ) have led to the question about model completeness of the expansion by such functions .",
    "we prove here the ( strongly ) model completeness of expansions of the field of real numbers by including in the language finitely many function symbols , containing modular functions and forms and the unrestricted exponential function .",
    "the strategy of our proof starts with the ideas of their paper , transforming the problem to a reduct of @xmath4 ( via eisenstein series ) and then we use the ideas from @xcite to introduce the unrestricted exponential function in order to obtain the model completeness for expansions by modular functions and forms defined in the fundamental domain @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this work is organised as follows .",
    "the following section contains the general elimination of quantifies and model completeness results to be used . in the next section we present the main results on the modular function @xmath5 and on quasimodular forms . in the final section on concluding remarks we comment on the problem of noneffectiveness of our proofs and",

    "these proofs would be a big step in the direction of the probable proof of the decidability of their theories .",
    "2 .   find a proof of effective model completeness of expansions by ( restricted ) noetherian functions ( those functions which generate a noetherian differential field over @xmath14 ) .",
    "the differential algebraic methods of @xcite do not immediately apply here , because they rely on the induction on the length of the _ pfaffian chain _ defining the functions and also on effective bounds on the number of connected components of the zero sets of systems of equations with pfaffian functions .",
    "see @xcite for some work on the complexity of noetherian systems .",
    "a useful result needed in the methods of @xcite is an effective bound on the number of connected components of the zero sets of a system of pfaffian functions . since the full sine function is a noetherian function , we see the need to restrict their domains to compact ( poly)intervals . the measure of the complexity of the noetherian functions have to take into account the size of the polyintervals to which they are restricted .",

    "the results in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite are relative to the truth some very difficult transcendental theoretic conjectures ( schanuel conjecture and its modular version ) . maybe by a finer analysis of the functions defined by terms on those structures we could find estimates which would circumvent the use of those conjectures .",
    "a question directly related with this work is wether the ( full ) exponential function is necessary to prove the model completeness of those structures .",
