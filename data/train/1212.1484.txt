    "entanglement and discord describe remarkable features of quantum systems .",
    "indeed , they are closely related to the amount of quantum correlations contained in the system , coming either from non - separability or the impossibility of local discrimination @xcite . beyond their specific role in fundamental physics , entanglement and discord",
    "has been also recognized as resources for quantum technology , e.g. for the processing of quantum information and for the effective implementation of quantum enhanced protocols . in particular ,",
    "in the last decade it has been recognized @xcite that separable mixed states may represent a resource , if they show a nonzero quantum discord .",
    "in fact , mixed separable states with non - zero discord have been exploited to achieve a speed - up for certain computational tasks compared to classical states  @xcite .",
    "this is true also for continuous variable systems , where gaussian quantum discord has been introduced @xcite , measured @xcite , and exploited for quantum enhanced protocols @xcite .",
    "an essential ingredient to exploit the quantumness of a physical system is the preservation of its coherent time evolution . on the other hand ,",
    "the unavoidable interaction with its environment usually destroys coherence and quantumness @xcite , and in turn its use for quantum technology . for these reasons",
    ", much attention has been devoted to the analysis , characterization and control of the dynamics of quantum correlations in different physical systems @xcite , including quantum optics @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance  @xcite , nanophysics  @xcite and biology  @xcite .    for bipartite open quantum systems interacting with a quantum environment , entanglement and discord may exhibit peculiar features such as sudden death and transitions , revivals , and trapping  @xcite .",
    "such phenomena have been linked either to direct  @xcite or indirect  @xcite effective two - qubit interactions . for non - interacting qubits they are due to the non - markovian nature of the environment  @xcite , which results in the transfer of correlations back and forth from the two - qubit system to the various parts of the total system . in this framework , it was shown @xcite that for a common bosonic environment the entanglement between two qubits is more robust against decoherence , and its dynamics is faster , than for independent environments with the same spectrum .",
    "the effect of the noise spectrum on the dynamics of quantum discord has been also analyzed @xcite .",
    "recently , revivals of quantum correlations have been found also for quantum system coupled to classical sources  @xcite and have been connected to a quantifier of non - markovianity for the dynamics of a single - qubit .",
    "indeed , it was proven that a classical noise can mimic , without loss of generality , a quantum environment not affected by the system or influenced in a way that does not result in back - action  @xcite .    among the class of open quantum systems interacting with a classical environment , a particular attention has been devoted to systems made of two qubits subjected to a classical source of random telegraph noise ( rtn )  @xcite , namely interacting with a bistable fluctuator , randomly switching between its two states with a given rate @xmath1 .",
    "depending upon the ratio between the switching rate and the system - environment coupling , the dynamics of a quantum system may exhibit markovian or non - markovian behavior .",
    "in fact , the great interest in rtn is due to the fact that it is able to model environmental fluctuations appearing in many nanodevices based on semiconductors , metals and superconductors  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it also represents the basic building block to describe noises of the type @xmath0 , which are responsible for decoherence in quantum solid - state devices  @xcite .",
    "this kind of noise spectra stem from the collection of random telegraph source with different switching rates and are usually referred to as _ colored _ spectra .",
    "the color of the noise depends upon the value of the parameter @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath3 the so - called pink @xmath4 noise is found , which is obtained from a set of random telegraph fluctuators weighted by the inverse of the switching rate .",
    "another interesting case is the @xmath5 spectrum , also called brown noise from its relation to a brownian motion .",
    "environments characterized by @xmath0 noise spectra usually arise when a system is coupled to a large number of bistable fluctuators , with a specific distribution of their switching rates . upon considering a collection of fluctuators , the colored noise may be implemented by means of a linear combination of sources of rtn ,",
    "each characterized by a specific switching rate chosen from a suitable distribution . on the other hand",
    ", the same spectrum can be obtained if we consider a single fluctuator with a random switching rate .",
    "as already observed by several authors @xcite different microscopic configurations of the environment leading to the same spectra , may correspond to different physical phenomena , e.g. different evolutions for the quantum correlations . in these cases ,",
    "i.e. when the knowledge of the noise spectrum is not sufficient to describe decoherence phenomena , the noise is referred to be non - gaussian . in particular , we investigate the time evolution of entanglement and discord of two initially entangled non - interacting qubits coupled to a classical environment described either by means of a single random fluctuator or a collection of rtn sources . for the model of a single fluctuator with random switching rate , the correlations decay with a damped oscillating behavior . in the configuration with many bistable fluctuators , pink noise leads to a monotonic decay of entanglement and discord , while the presence of brown noise induces phenomena of sudden death and revivals .",
    "we ascribe this discrepancies to the different number of decoherence channels in the two configurations . in other words , the time - evolution of the system",
    "is determined not only by the spectrum of the environment , but also by its configurations , i.e. to its microscopic structure .",
    "for both the configurations , the dynamics of the two qubits is ruled by a stochastic hamiltonian with time dependent coupling .",
    "the average of the time - evolved states over the switching parameters describes the evolution of the two - qubit state under the effect of the noise . upon a suitable choice of stochastic time - dependent terms in the hamiltonian , we are able to describe the effects of both separate and common environments :",
    "in the former each qubit is locally coupled to a random external signal , while in the latter both qubits are subject to the effect of a common classical environment .",
    "the interest in systems interacting with a common environment arises from recent experiments in cavity qed @xcite and circuit qed @xcite where reservoir - mediated interaction between two qubits is at the heart of entanglement generation .",
    "environmental effects due to a collection of bistable fluctuators have been experimentally observed in nanoscale electronic devices , where the single electron tunnelling turns out to be affected by charge fluctuations @xcite .",
    "our results may be thus used as a valid guideline to analyze decoherence phenomena in josephson circuits subject to noise stemming from fluctuating background charges and flux @xcite .",
    "other systems where the noise is non - gaussian and comes from a collection of two - level fluctuators include silicon @xcite and magnetic ones @xcite , as well as vortex matter @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we briefly review the definition of negativity as a measure of entanglement , and of quantum discord . in section 3",
    "we present the physical model for two qubits interacting with a classical environment , being represented either by a single random bistable fluctuator or a collection of fluctuators .",
    "section 4 reports results for the different configurations , whereas section 5 closes the paper with a discussion and some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we briefly review the concepts of entanglement and quantum discord between two qubits .",
    "in particular we evaluate entanglement by means of negativity@xcite , which is given by : @xmath6 where @xmath7 are the negative eigenvalues of the partial transpose of the system density matrix . note that the negativity is bound between zero , for separable states , and one , for maximally entangled states .",
    "the concept of negativity has recently been extended to the case of tripartite systems of identical particles @xcite .",
    "the quantumness of correlations of bipartite a system may be also quantified by discord @xcite , namely the difference between the total and the classical correlations in a system .",
    "the quantum mutual information quantifies the total correlations in a system and is defined as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the partial trace of the total bipartite system @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the von neumann entropy .",
    "the classical correlations are evaluated by means of the expression @xcite @xmath12 $ ] where @xmath13 are projective measurements on subsystem @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with @xmath16/\\text{tr}[\\pi_j\\rho\\pi_j]$ ] is the remaining state of @xmath17 after obtaining outcome @xmath18 on @xmath14 .",
    "therefore the quantum discord is the difference between the mutual information and the classical correlation : @xmath19 usually , the evaluation of quantum discord is not an easy task , since it involves an optimization problem .",
    "however , for two - qubit systems described by a density matrix of the form ( from now on referred to as states with a x shape ) @xmath20 , where @xmath21 are the three pauli matrices , the optimization may be carried out analytically @xcite , leading to @xmath22\\nonumber\\\\ & -\\frac{1-c}{2}\\log_2(1-c)-\\frac{1+c}{2}\\log_2(1+c)\\label{discordluo},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 .",
    "we address quantum correlations , both entanglement and discord , between two non - interacting qubits subjected to noisy environments . our analysis concerns environments with noise spectra of the form @xmath24 , which are realized by different configurations of bistable fluctuators .",
    "the two qubits are initially prepared in the bell state @xmath25 .",
    "the interaction between the qubits and the environment can be either local or global , i.e. we examine both the case of independent environments acting locally on each qubit and of a common environment affecting the two qubits .",
    "if we set @xmath26 and adopt the spin notation , the two - qubit hamiltonian describing the interaction with a single fluctuator is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the hamiltonian of a single qubit subject to a classical time - dependent noise which affects the transition amplitude parameter @xmath29 : @xmath30 with @xmath31 the qubit energy in absence of noise ( energy degeneracy is assumed ) , @xmath32 the identity matrix for subspace @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the coupling constant between the system and the environment , @xmath35 the pauli matrix .",

    "we have analyzed in details the dynamics of quantum correlations , entanglement and discord , for a two - qubit system initially prepared in a maximally entangled state and then subjected to classical noise , i.e. coupled with an external environment consisting in a collection of classical bistable flcutuators . in particular , due to its relevance for solid state devices , we have addressed environments characterized by a @xmath0 noise spectrum .",
    "we analyzed both the case of independent environments associated to each qubit and of a common environment , and we have taken into account explicitly the structure of the environment . more specifically , we have analyzed distinct configurations of the environment , characterized by the same @xmath0 spectrum , but with a different number of decoherence channels .",
    "analytical expressions have been found for the negativity and the discord , showing the same qualitative behavior in all the analyzed regimes .",
    "indeed the choice of maximally entangled initial state together with the sheer dephasing nature of the interaction with the environment , makes discord a function of negativity only . in these systems , in fact , the evolved state is a mixture of bell states .",
    "in the first configuration we have addressed , the two qubits interact with a single bistable fluctuator , which has a random switching rate leading to an overall @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "an oscillating behavior of quantum correlations for both pink and brown noise has been found .",
    "the effect of a common environment is that of better preserving the correlations and to double the number of revivals compared to the case of independent baths . in the presence of pink noise ,",
    "the peaks of negativity and discord decay faster than in the presence of brown noise .",
    "in fact , the switching rates are more evenly distributed over the range @xmath72 $ ] than in the case of the @xmath107 noise , thus leading to massive destructive interference . in the second configuration",
    "the two qubits interact with a collection of bistable fluctuators , each one with fixed switching rate chosen from a distribution @xmath46 ; also in this case the overall noise spectrum is @xmath0 . in the case of pink noise ,",
    "entanglement and discord show a monotonic decay , while for brown noise , sudden death and revivals occur .",
    "quantum correlations can be written as a product of oscillating and exponential functions .",
    "since the switching rates of the fluctuators are selected from a distribution @xmath0 , for the pink noise they lead to destructive interference , while brown noise enhances constructive interference .",
    "the action of independent or common environments has different effects on the robustness of correlations and this agrees with previous results obtained with different noise models @xcite .    our results clearly show that the behavior of quantum correlations in not influenced only by the spectrum of the environment , but also by the number of decoherence channels , i.e. by the very structure of the environment . with a single decoherence channel ,",
    "revivals of correlations appear , indicating that a back - flow of information from the environment to the system is possible .",
    "when the number of decoherence channels is increased , the information is quickly lost , and no revivals can occur .",
    "the characterization and the control of quantum correlations are fundamental for the development of quantum technology .",
    "not only quantum correlations constitute a resource to process quantum information , but the deep understanding of their nature will provide a better insight on the nature of quantum states themselves and on the transition between quantum and classical description of physical systems .",
    "our results indicate that the microscopic structure of environment , besides its noise spectrum , is relevant for the dynamics of quantum correlations , and may be a valid starting point for the engineering of colored non - gaussian environments .",

    "<S> we address the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord for two non interacting qubits initially prepared in a maximally entangled state and then subjected to a classical colored noise , i.e. coupled with an external environment characterized by a noise spectrum of the form @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , we address systems where the gaussian approximation fails , i.e. the sole knowledge of the spectrum is not enough to determine the dynamics of quantum correlations . </S>",
    "<S> we thus investigate the dynamics for two different configurations of the environment : in the first case the noise spectrum is due to the interaction of each qubit with a single bistable fluctuator with an undetermined switching rate , whereas in the second case we consider a collection of classical fluctuators with fixed switching rates . in both cases we found analytical expressions for the time dependence of entanglement and quantum discord , which may be also extended to a collection of flcutuators with random switching rates . </S>",
    "<S> the environmental noise is introduced by means of stochastic time - dependent terms in the hamiltonian and this allows us to describe the effects of both separate and common environments . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the non - gaussian character of the noise may lead to significant effects , e.g. environments with the same power spectrum , but different configurations , give raise to opposite behavior for the quantum correlations . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> depending on the characteristics of the environmental noise considered , both entanglement and discord display either a monotonic decay or the phenomena of sudden death and revivals . </S>",
