    "they address molecular manipulation , involving external angular degrees of freedom , aiming at a parallel positioning of the molecular axis with respect to the laser polarization vector ( _ alignment _ ) or , even more demanding , with a given direction ( _ orientation _ ) .",
    "one of the basic motivations remains the drastic increase of reactive cross sections , highly sensitive to stereodynamical effects ( frontal collisions ) .",
    "laser - induced isomerization  @xcite , isotope separation  @xcite , molecular trapping  @xcite , or surface processing and catalysis  @xcite are some of the illustrations of the widely growing interest in molecular manipulation .",
    "the most common idea is to excite a broad rotational band @xmath2 in order to recover a narrow angular distribution @xmath3 , through the celebrated relation @xmath4 ( @xmath5 being the total angular momentum and @xmath6 the molecule - laser angle ) .",
    "our approach to this problem is , however , different .",
    "the emphasis is put on the depiction and study of some laser - induced dynamical mechanisms that are relevant to the alignment / orientation process : pendular states in high - frequency fields ; two - photon ( fundamental and second - harmonic ) excitations ; the kick mechanism . the question of how to take advantage of such mechanisms in a control scheme is brought up only in a second step .",
    "adiabatic transport from an isotropic distribution to a pendular state ; two ir laser pulses with frequencies in a ratio 2 , the second harmonic being in resonance with a vibrational transition ; very asymmetric and short - duration ( sudden ) half - cycle pulses imparting sudden kicks to the molecule , are some of the scenarios which are depicted and discussed in the following . finally , in a third step , this knowledge is fully exploited in optimal control schemes , not merely for initial guesses in parameter sampling , but mainly to get a better understanding and interpretation of otherwise black - box type calculations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : align ] is devoted to intense laser alignment of the hcn molecule , through pendular states as the elementary mechanism and adiabatic / sudden transport as the control strategy .",
    "section  [ sec : w2w ] presents the two - color orientation of hcn by a parity mixing scenario in the rotational distribution . the kick mechanism with a half - cycle pulse sudden excitation scenario",
    "is examined in section  [ sec : hcp ] , as illustrated on the licl molecule .",
    "sudden - excitation - based optimal control scenarios , with a thorough analysis of the role of different orientation criteria , are analyzed , using hcn and lif , in section  [ sec : optimal ] .",
    "the linear hcn molecule , taken as an illustrative example , is described by its internal stretching motions ( collectively labelled @xmath7 ) and external rotational motions described by its polar @xmath6 and azimuthal @xmath8 angles with respect to the laser polarization vector ( see figure  [ fig : model ] ) .     of the laser , by its polar @xmath6 and azimuthal @xmath8 angles .",

    "the hamiltonian involves a single born - oppenheimer potential curve @xmath10 ( the molecular electronic ground state ) and the radiative coupling @xmath11 given by the scalar product of the field - induced dipole moment @xmath12 with the electric field amplitude @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the kinetic energy operator in @xmath7 , @xmath16 the angular momentum operator , and @xmath17 the moment of inertia of the molecule .",
    "the dipole moment itself is taken as the sum of a permanent dipole @xmath18 and a polarizability @xmath19 @xmath20 such that @xmath21 in the last equation , we have made use of the fact that , for a linear molecule , @xmath22 , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 , when the @xmath25 axis is chosen to be collinear with the molecular axis .",
    "due to cylindrical symmetry and since the laser - molecule coupling term does not depend explicitly on @xmath8 , the motion on @xmath8 can be considered separately and is no longer taken into account .",
    "the laser pulses are of the form @xmath26 , with @xmath27 the time varying envelope of the electric field of frequency @xmath0 and phase @xmath28 .",
    "we will consider laser pulses of a maximum intensity of the order of @xmath29 , to avoid ionization damage to the molecule .",
    "the frequency @xmath0 is taken in the infra - red region , so it is considerably higher than the rotational frequency of the molecule .",
    "the dynamics of the molecular system are then obtained by solving numerically the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath30 ( on a discretized grid using the split - operator method  @xcite ) , starting from an initial wave function @xmath31 taken , in most cases , as the ground ( rotationally isotropic ) state of the molecule .      in this high - frequency regime ,",
    "two different motions are considered : a fast motion associated with the electric field @xmath32 and a slow motion associated with the molecular rotation described by @xmath6 . to simplify the presentation , we freeze the molecular internal motions , assuming a rigid rotor behavior . the eigenvectors of the slow motion @xmath33 obey , after averaging over the fast motion within an optical period ( and some high - frequency approximations ) a schrdinger equation given by  @xcite @xmath34 \\xi_{nj } ( \\theta ) \\nonumber \\\\    = \\left ( \\lambda_{n } - j\\hbar\\omega + \\frac{\\alpha_{\\parallel }    \\mathcal{e}_{0}^{2}}{4 } \\right ) \\xi_{nj } ( \\theta ) ,    \\label{eq : hf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 .",

    "because of the resulting libration motion for a molecule that is in one of these eigenstates , they are dubbed _ pendular states",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note a close analogy with the classical lagrange equation of the laser - driven rigid rotor under the combined effect of the permanent dipole and the polarizability  @xcite , @xmath40 the classical force of the right - hand - side of equation  ( [ eq : lagrange ] ) is nothing but the gradient of the effective potential of the hamiltonian version , equation  ( [ eq : hf ] ) .",
    "this classical analogy leads , upon a change of variable @xmath41 , to the well - known equation of the pendulum , @xmath42 that librates with small oscillations @xmath6 around the laser polarization axis with a frequency @xmath43 where the polarizability remains the leading term as soon as the laser frequency exceeds 315  @xmath44 ( for the hcn molecule ) , whatever the intensity .",
    "the question of how to take advantage of the pendular mechanism to control molecular alignment can be answered by referring to adiabatic vs sudden transport dynamics , starting from an initial isotropic distribution ( @xmath45 , as prepared , for instance , by laser cooling methods  @xcite ) .",
    "the adiabatic switching of a laser with rise and fall times of 10  ps ( same order as the molecular rotational period ) and an intensity of @xmath46 allows an adiabatic transport on a single ( lowest ) pendular state with a good alignment during the excitation .",
    "figure  [ fig : adia](a ) illustrates the alignment dynamics through the expectation value of @xmath47 , i.e. , @xmath48    ; ( b ) a short , sudden pulse of 1.7  ps duration and of intensity @xmath49 .",
    "the pulse envelopes are schematically represented by the shaded areas . ]    the higher the value , the better the alignment , with @xmath50 corresponding to an isotropic distribution .",
    "an alignment of @xmath51 is achieved during the pulse but , as expected , the laser extinction adiabatically transports the pendular state back to the isotropic ( @xmath45 ) state .    to achieve post - pulse alignment ,",
    "one may proceed with sudden excitations .",
    "figure  [ fig : adia](b ) shows the effect of a sudden pulse of 1.7  ps duration , which excites several pendular states with a specific distribution ( for a field frequency resonant with hcn internal vibrations ) .",
    "the particular @xmath5 distribution reached is such that alignment remains even after the pulse is off , @xmath52 showing small amplitude oscillations around a value of @xmath53 .",
    "as compared to alignment , orientation , which imposes a given direction , is a more challenging goal that requires symmetry breaking in the forward and backward directions .",
    "two such scenarios are considered in this work .",
    "the first concerns the use of two - color pulses , that is a combination of a fundamental frequency @xmath0 and its second harmonic @xmath1 with a resulting field @xmath54,\\ ] ] where maximum asymmetry is reached for @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "but the asymmetry we are referring to is not in the time dependence of @xmath57 , which in any case is not enough to produce orientation as , in average over an optical period of the field , the positive and negative contributions are canceling each other .",
    "we are rather referring to parity breaking in the rotational quantum numbers @xmath5 .",
    "as opposite to a monochromatic field that excites @xmath5 s of the same parity , two - color excitation has the potentiality to mix @xmath5 s of different parity . actually , by taking @xmath1 in resonance with the @xmath58 vibrational transition of hcn , the absorption of a single photon @xmath1 excites odd @xmath5 s through the permanent dipole interaction @xmath59 , whereas the absorption of two photons @xmath0 excites even @xmath5 s through the polarizability interaction @xmath60 ( starting from an initial state @xmath45 )  @xcite .",
    "it is precisely the mixture of odd and even @xmath5 s that produces , by the superposition of associated spherical harmonics , the asymmetrical angular distributions that are looked for .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : w2w](a ) as the expectation value of @xmath61 , which is a measure of orientation ( the higher the absolute value , the better the orientation ) .     and @xmath1 , the latter being in resonance with the @xmath62 vibrational transition of the c  h stretch .",
    "]    we see that orientation is actually achieved at the extinction of the laser pulse and more efficiently a short time after the pulse is off , with @xmath63 reaching @xmath64 .",
    "orientation can also be achieved by an adiabatic transport from an initial isotropic state to an asymmetric combination of pendular states by a two - color excitation scheme  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the result shown in figure  [ fig : w2w ] , such an orientation can only be maintained while the laser is on , similarly to what is observed for alignment in figure  [ fig : adia](a ) .",
    "the second symmetry breaking scenario addresses the temporal shape of the electric field .",
    "the most asymmetrical situation that is experimentally reachable is the use of half - cycle pulses ( hcp s )  @xcite .",
    "such picosecond , far - ir electromagnetic pulses are generated when illuminating a gaas wafer , in the presence of a pulsed electric field applied across the surface , by a ti - sapphire laser  @xcite .",
    "such pulses have three interesting characteristics ( as illustrated on figure  [ fig : hcp ] ) :        1 .",
    "their intensities remain less than @xmath65 , therefore present no risk of ionization damage on typical diatomic molecules ; 2 .",
    "their relatively broad fourier transform ( @xmath66 ) shows the presence of non - negligible field components that can induce rotational excitations ; 3 .",
    "they are very sudden with respect to rotation ( their positive component lasts typically 1  ps ) and very asymmetric ( the ratio of the positive to the negative maximum is more than 10 ) .",
    "a direct consequence is that such unipolar pulses can impart a `` kick '' to the molecule that effectively orients it in the direction of the positive field component , the transfer of angular momentum taking place on the timescale of the short pulse  @xcite .",
    "the long - duration negative tail of the hcp is adiabatic enough not to induce further noticeable changes in the dynamics .",
    "actually , the kick seems the most efficient orientation mechanism up to date .",
