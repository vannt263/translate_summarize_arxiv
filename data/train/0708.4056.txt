    "anyons are not only theoretically interesting but also can be realized as quasiparticles in the fractional quantum hall effect  @xcite . recently it is argued that anyonic quasiparticles may be created using rotating bose - einstein condensates  @xcite or cold atoms confined in an optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "furthermore anyons are attracting renewed interest in the context of quantum computation  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we investigate nonrelativistic anyons interacting via a contact interaction .",
    "motivated by recent experimental realization of fermions and bosons at infinite scattering length , we focus on the case where the two - body interaction is tuned to the resonance at threshold , i.e. , two anyons form a bound state with zero binding energy .",
    "because of its scale invariance , such a system should be described by nonrelativistic conformal field theories ( cft ) .",
    "a field - theoretical description of resonantly interacting anyons known so far allows for perturbative calculations only near the bosonic limit  @xcite  .",
    "here we propose an alternative description that becomes perturbative near the fermionic limit and study a few - body problem of resonantly interacting anyons . for more than two anyons , additional three - body and four - body contact interactions turn out to be necessary to ensure the renormalizability of the theory . in the renormalization group ( rg )",
    "equations of three - body and four - body couplings , we will find two nontrivial fixed points and a limit cycle behavior of the four - body coupling .",
    "our finding implies the existence of an infinite set of discrete bound states in the four - anyon system , where the ratio of two successive binding energies is given by @xmath0 near the fermionic limit @xmath1 .",
    "before going on to the field - theoretical formulation of anyons with the contact interaction , it is instructive to review two - anyon problem in quantum mechanics .",
    "anyons are characterized by a phase @xmath2 acquired by the wave function under the exchange of two anyons . without loss of generality",
    ", the statistics parameter @xmath3 is assumed to be in the interval @xmath4 $ ] . for the later convenience , we chose @xmath3 so that @xmath5 corresponds to fermions and @xmath6 corresponds to bosons .    in the center of mass frame",
    ", the two - body wave function can be expressed as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are relative distance and angle between two anyons .",
    "@xmath10 is a fermionic wave function which is antisymmetric under @xmath11 .",
    "since @xmath12 obeys a free schrdinger equation , the wave function expanded in partial waves @xmath13 satisfies ( below @xmath14 and anyon mass @xmath15 ) @xmath16r_l(r)=0\\ ] ] for @xmath17 , where the odd integer @xmath18 is an orbital angular momentum .    the contact interaction between anyons",
    "can be introduced by allowing a singular solution that behaves as @xmath19 at origin @xmath20 , i.e. , when the positions of two anyons coincide  @xcite . because of the square integrability of the wave function , the contact interaction is available only for @xmath21 when @xmath22 or for @xmath23 when @xmath24 . in this channel ,",
    "the contact interaction is equivalent to imposing the following boundary condition on the wave function at origin : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a real parameter analogous to the scattering length in three spatial dimensions .",
    "there are two scale - independent boundary conditions ; @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the former corresponds to the usual non - colliding limit . since the binding energy is given by  @xcite @xmath29^{\\frac1{1-|\\alpha|}}\\ ] ]",
    "when @xmath26 is positive , the resonant limit corresponds to @xmath28 .",
    "an interesting observation is that the normalization integral of the wave function ( [ eq : wavefunction ] ) is logarithmically divergent at @xmath30 in the fermionic limit @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , if the statistics is close to fermion , the two - body wave function is concentrated near the origin , and the anyon pair forms a pointlike dimer .",
    "the same situation has been observed in two - component fermions at infinite scattering length near four spatial dimensions  @xcite .",
    "this observation has led to a field theory composed of weakly coupled fermions and dimers  @xcite .",
    "similarly , as we shall see below , it is possible to formulate a field theory describing resonantly interacting anyons , which allows for a perturbative analysis near the fermionic limit .",
    "the field - theoretical representation of anyons is provided by a nonrelativistic field @xmath32 minimally coupled to a chern - simons ( cs ) gauge field @xmath33  @xcite : @xmath34 in our definition of @xmath3 , @xmath32 is a fermionic field .",
    "@xmath35 is the anyon chemical potential and here we consider the system at zero density @xmath36 .",
    "we shall work in the coulomb gauge @xmath37 .",
    "motivated by the above argument , it is natural to add the following terms involving the dimer field @xmath38 to ( [ eq : l_psi ] ) : @xmath39 @xmath38 is a bosonic field with mass @xmath40 and has the orbital angular momentum @xmath41 .",
    "the upper sign corresponds to @xmath22 and the lower sign corresponds to @xmath24 throughout this article .",

    "@xmath44 is a cutoff - dependent bare `` mass gap '' , which is fine - tuned so that the @xmath38 propagator has a pole at @xmath45 , i.e. , @xmath46 this condition is equivalent to the fine - tuning to the resonant limit ( zero binding energy ) .",
    "the other marginal operators one can add to the lagrangian density are three - body and four - body contact interactions : @xmath47 note that terms as @xmath48 and @xmath49 are also allowed , but they can be absorbed by the redefinition of @xmath50 and @xmath51 if we use the cs gauss law @xmath52 thus , the most general renormalizable lagrangian density composed of @xmath32 and @xmath38 becomes @xmath53 .",
    "first , we concentrate on the two - body sector , i.e. , a renormalization of the two - body coupling @xmath42 .",
    "the renormalization of the theory can be performed in the standard way .",

    "this diagram also contributes to the renormalization of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "[ fig : gauge_coupling],scaledwidth=30.0% ]    the other one - loop diagrams that contribute to the renormalization of @xmath50 and @xmath51 are depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig : three - anyon ] and [ fig : four - anyon ] , respectively . taking into account the contribution of the wave - function renormalization of @xmath38 ,",
    "rg equations that govern the running of @xmath50 and @xmath51 are given by @xmath77 here @xmath65 was substituted .",
    "we note that the @xmath78 function of @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) is a quadratic function of @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) to all orders .",
    "higher order corrections appear only in their coefficients and do not alter the following discussions as far as the perturbative expansion is valid @xmath1 .    .",
    "[ fig : three - anyon],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    .",
    "[ fig : four - anyon],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    equation ( [ eq : v_3 ] ) has two fixed points at @xmath79 each of which corresponds to a scale - independent short range boundary condition on the three - body wave function .",
    "the stable fixed point ( @xmath80 ) corresponds to the regular wave function without the three - body resonance , while the unstable one ( @xmath81 ) corresponds to the three - body resonance at threshold .",
    "when @xmath50 is at the former fixed point @xmath80 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_4 ] ) also has stable and unstable fixed points at @xmath82 the unstable fixed point @xmath83 corresponds to the four - body resonance at threshold .    however , when @xmath50 is at the other fixed point corresponding to the three - body resonance , eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_4 ] ) does not have a fixed point . in this case , the solution of the coupled equations ( [ eq : v_3 ] ) and ( [ eq : v_4 ] ) is @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a constant of integration .",
    "we thus find a rg limit cycle where @xmath86 is a constant and @xmath87 is a periodic function of @xmath88 with a primitive period @xmath89 .",
    "the system tuned to this limit cycle has a discrete scaling symmetry with a scaling factor @xmath90 $ ] in momentum .",
    "it especially implies a geometric spectrum of energy eigenvalues  @xcite in the four - anyon system when two - body and three - body interactions are simultaneously tuned to the resonance .",
    "when the statistics is close to fermion @xmath1 , the ratio of two successive energy eigenvalues is given by @xmath91.\\ ] ] there are an infinite number of bound states with an accumulation point at zero energy .",
    "this resembles efimov states in three - body systems at infinite scattering length in three spatial dimensions  @xcite , whose experimental evidence has been recently reported using cold atoms in ref",
    ".  @xcite .    near the bosonic limit ,",
    "on the other hand , the efimov states do not exist in a few - anyon system .",
    "this is because the two - body resonant interaction becomes just zero interaction in the bosonic limit .",
    "therefore , there should be at least one critical value of @xmath3 where the four - anyon bound states disappear .",
    "determination of such a critical @xmath3 is , however , beyond the scope of our perturbative approach .",
    "the rg flow diagram obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : v_3 ] ) and ( [ eq : v_4 ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rg_flow ] .",
    "we see two fixed points located at @xmath92 and the limit cycle given by the solution ( [ eq : limit_cycle ] ) .     and",
    "@xmath51 at @xmath65 .",
    "there are two fixed points ( dots ) and one limit cycle ( thick line with two arrows ) .",
    "the arrows indicate flows toward the infrared limit .",
    "[ fig : rg_flow],scaledwidth=46.0% ]",
    "it is worthwhile to determine scaling dimensions of @xmath93-body operators at the fixed points because they are observable as energy eigenvalues in a harmonic potential  @xcite . at the one - loop level , anomalous dimensions of three - body and four - body composite operators @xmath94 and @xmath95 are , respectively , computed as @xmath96 from those , we obtain the scaling dimension of the lowest @xmath97-body operator @xmath98 as @xmath99 and that of the lowest @xmath100-body operator @xmath101 as @xmath102 up to the order @xmath3 .",
    "then the ground state energy of @xmath93 anyons in a harmonic potential is given by the scaling dimension of the @xmath93-body operator times @xmath70 .",
    "the leading - order results can be easily understood by recalling that , in the fermionic limit @xmath31 , fermion pairs at the @xmath43-wave resonance form point - like bosons and they do not interact with each other or with extra fermions .",
    "since these particles can occupy the same state , the ground state energy is simply given by the number of particles multiplied by the lowest single particle energy @xmath70 in a harmonic potential .",
    "an interesting extension of our work is to the many - body system of anyons . here",
    "we discuss some qualitative features of such a system .",
    "when the two - body resonant interaction is present , we have choices to further introduce the three - body and four - body resonant interactions .",
    "if the three - body resonant interaction is introduced , the efimov effect occurs in the four - anyon system ( the limit cycle in fig .",
    "[ fig : rg_flow ] ) and accordingly the corresponding many - body system can not be stable . instead , if the four - body resonant interaction is introduced ( the upper fixed point in fig .  [ fig : rg_flow ] ) , the corresponding many - body system will be unstable because of the attractive interaction between bosonic dimers .",
    "therefore the only stable many - body system seems to be the case where the two - body resonant interaction is present without the three - body and four - body resonant interactions ( the lower fixed point in fig .",
    "[ fig : rg_flow ] ) .    in this case",
    ", we define @xmath103 as a ratio of the ground state energy @xmath104 to that of `` noninteracting '' anyons @xmath105 at the same density and statistics ; @xmath106 .",
    "since the system has no intrinsic dimensionful quantity , @xmath103 can depend only on the statistics parameter @xmath3 .",
    "although it is a difficult many - body problem to determine @xmath103 in general @xmath3 , the problem becomes treatable near the fermionic limit . in the fermionic limit , the ground state energy @xmath104 vanishes because resonantly interacting anyons form noninteracting point - like bosons , while @xmath105 remains nonzero because of the fermi energy .",
    "therefore we have @xmath107 in the fermionic limit @xmath108 .",
    "corrections to @xmath103 near the fermionic limit are computable using the perturbative framework developed in this article .",
    "it will be important in future works to further study many - body properties of resonantly interacting anyons , for example , whether they exhibit superfluidity , and their implications for real planar systems .",
    "we have investigated anyons with a contact interaction by formulating a field theory that becomes perturbative near the fermionic limit .",
    "we identified a fixed point that describes anyons at the two - body resonance . in rg equations for three - body and four - body couplings , we found two nontrivial fixed points and computed scaling dimensions of @xmath93-body operators which are observable as a ground state energy of @xmath93 anyons in a harmonic potential .",
    "furthermore , we found a limit cycle behavior in the four - body coupling , which implies an infinite set of discrete bound states ( efimov states ) in the four - anyon system when both the two - body and three - body interactions are tuned to the resonance .",
    "such a system provides a unique opportunity to study efimov - type physics within a perturbative framework . it should be possible to verify these results by solving a few - body schrdinger equation for anyons with suitable short range boundary conditions and hopefully by experiments in the future .",
    "we believe this work opens up new universal physics in the system of anyons in two spatial dimensions .",
