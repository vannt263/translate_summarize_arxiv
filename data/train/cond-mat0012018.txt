    "principal aspects of the short - range order can be investigated within the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the exact solution of the hubbard hamiltonian is known for 1d chain @xcite .",
    "great simplifications appear in infinite dimensions because spatial correlations do not play an important role in this limit @xcite . as for lattices of intermediate dimensions , which are of great practical importance",
    ", one has to follow various numerical and analytical approximations @xcite .",
    "recently a new variational approach to the ground state of the hubbard model was proposed @xcite .",
    "in addition to intrasite correlations the trial wave function of gutzwiller s type @xcite contains nearest - neighbor correlations in an explicit form .",
    "in contrast to ref.@xcite , kikuchi s ( cluster variation ) method @xcite was used to evaluate the ground state energy .",
    "it was shown that the short - range correlations affect significantly the ground state of the hubbard model .",
    "a comparison of this result with the variational monte carlo method ( vmc ) @xcite based on the gutzwiller trial wave function and @xmath4-expansion in the dynamical mean - field theory @xcite shows that the latters underestimate significantly the ground state energy at intermediate coupling .",
    "a heavy fermion behavior usually arises from an interplay between a lattice of localized @xmath5-electrons and itinerant electrons . in the kondo limit ,",
    "such a system becomes a kondo lattice @xcite .",
    "in many cases the itinerant subsystem of the kondo lattice is formed by a narrow @xmath6-band where the short - range coulomb interaction between itinerant electrons is considerable .",
    "there is a lot of examples of this kind @xcite .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to describe the itinerant subsystem by means of the hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "thus , we come to the kondo - hubbard lattice model @xcite .",
    "it was shown by means of neutron scattering experiments that strong short - range antiferromagnetic ( afm ) correlations exist in kondo and kondo - hubbard lattices @xcite .",
    "they play an important role in the heavy fermions behavior . in this paper ,",

    "the results are discussed in sec.iv .",
    "let us consider a lattice with one orbital per site and restrict ourselves to nearest - neighbor hopping only .",
    "then , the hubbard model has the following form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of a fermion of spin @xmath11 on the @xmath12-th lattice site , @xmath13 denotes a pair of adjacent sites , @xmath14 .",

    "the eigenvalues turn out to be related to each other by normalization conditions @xcite @xmath37 and self - consistency conditions @xcite @xmath38    as concentrations of fermions of each spins are fixed there are the only independent parameter @xmath39 and 7 independent parameters @xmath40 . in the case of half band - filling , additional constrains appear @xmath41 which reduce the number of the independent parameters @xmath42 to 3 .",
    "assume that @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 are the independent parameters .",

    ", the hubbard model at half band - filling reduces to the spin-@xmath7 hiesenberg model .",
    "the residual afm correlations in the pm phase are consistent with the results of the ground state studying of the hiesenberg model @xcite .",
    "it was also shown in ref.@xcite that in the afm phase , the both methods ( the vmc method and the present one ) give almost the same ground state energy , i.e. in the presence of the long - range order , the short - range correlations are inessential .    in the kondo - hubbard model",
    "we observe two different types of behavior depending on value of @xmath191 . at small @xmath191 , the exchange term",
    "weakly affects the ground state energy and effective mass .",
    "it should be noted that the afm correlations between localized states at a pair of nearest - neighbors sites ( @xmath217 ) increase with increasing of @xmath191 .",
    "this effect appears because the short - range afm correlations between band fermions exist at @xmath218 and at small @xmath191 the correlations between localized states follow the correlations of band fermions .",
    "the growth of the exchange leads to suppression of the band correlations . in fig.5",
    ", it is seen a transition to another regime ( large @xmath191 ) . for simple cubic lattice",
    "we have obtained a discontinuity of @xmath219 and a sharp turn of @xmath220 for both @xmath221 and @xmath222 cases , i.e. a phase transition .",
    "a smooth crossover is observed in 1d chain and square lattice at this point ( see fig.5 ) . at present , it is hardly possible to establish a kind of the phase transition . we can rule out the first order transition only because the ground state energy is smooth ( the derivative of the ground state energy is continuous ) . at higher",
    "@xmath191 , the correlations between localized states start to decrease with increasing @xmath191 .",
    "it should be mentioned that the behavior of the spin correlation function @xmath217 is similar to that ensued from doniach s phase diagram despite the fact that the rkky interaction is not included into the variational theory .",
    "the coulomb interaction between itinerant fermions @xmath114 influences the ground state in two ways . on the first hand",
    ", it reinforces the short - range order and increases the afm correlations between nearest - neighbor localized states . on the other hand , at large @xmath114 the effective quasi - particle band gets smaller that favors the kondo regime .    at large @xmath191 , the ground state energy approaches asymptotically the energy of the pair singlet state ( @xmath223 for @xmath221 ) .",
    "the probability of the kondo singlet ( @xmath192 ) at a site goes to 1 ( see fig.7 ) for @xmath221 and to some fixed value ( independent on the lattice dimension ) for @xmath224 .",
    "the difference is due to the fact that , in the first case , the ground state is a superposition of two antiparallel states ( @xmath225 ) and , in the case of a pair @xmath222 , @xmath226 , it involves all the possible states ( @xmath227 , @xmath228 and _ etc .",
    "_ ) for the total energy to be minimal . at large @xmath191",
    "the effective mass of itinerant fermions increases drastically and tends to almost linear behavior with variation @xmath191 ( @xmath229 where @xmath230 is the constant depending on the type of lattice ) as can be seen in fig.6 .",
    "this is the kondo lattice regime . in the case of @xmath222 ,",
    "the effective mass is significantly larger then for @xmath221 . in a real system",
    ", @xmath231 ca nt increase infinitely and a localization of fermions should occur due to disorder or temperature effects but this is beyond the scope of the present paper .    the crystal field can be taken into account in the variational scheme .",
    "it can be easily done in the limit of the strong crystal field when we consider the lowest level of the multiplet only . in the general case",
    ", we have to use additional variational parameters to control different populations at multiplet levels .",
    "for instance , if the ground state of ce@xmath193 ion is splitted by the crystal field into a doublet and a quadruplet ( e.g. @xmath232 and @xmath233 states ) , we should apply the only additional variational parameter to the trail wave function .",
    "if it is splitted into three doublets , we have to use two additional parameters and _",
    "etc_.    in the framework of the variational theory presented above the strongly correlated coherent metal state appears in a natural way similarly to the gutzwiller theory .",
    "this provides a good basis for investigations of strongly correlated metal systems and dense kondo systems by means of this theory .",
    "the main shortcoming of our approach is neglect of closed loops while we treat the correlations on a lattice .",
    "nevertheless , it is considered that kikuchi s method yields a good approximation if the correlation length is not greater than a cluster size @xcite .",
    "the well - developed cluster variation method allows to include short closed loops , which are most important , into considerations @xcite .",
    "the short - range correlations are observed directly by the neutron scattering .",
    "the afm correlations in the strongly correlated metals like v@xmath2o@xmath3 and kondo lattices turn out to be strong but very short @xcite .",
    "that is why the closed loops are inessential in this substances .",
    "let us mention that one can calculated the neutron cross - section and dynamical susceptibility from the results obtained above . at the same time , it is hardly possible to apply the present theory to systems with lengthy afm correlations ( e.g. strongly underdoped high temperature superconductors @xcite ) .",
