    "the concept of the critical state introduced by charles bean @xcite is widely used to describe various physical phenomena in the vortex phase of type - ii superconductors , see , e.g. , refs .   and citations therein .",
    "according to bean , in the critical state of type - ii superconductors with flux - line pinning , the driving force of the currents flowing in this state is balanced by the pinning force acting on the vortices .",
    "the critical state is characterized by the component of the current density flowing _ perpendicular _ to the flux lines , @xmath0 , since only this component generates a driving force .",
    "it is assumed in the critical - state theory that this @xmath0 is known , i.e. , it is a given function of the magnetic induction @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and the problem of this theory is to find the appropriate distribution of the magnetic fields and currents in the critical state .",
    "below , for simplicity , we shall assume that the magnetic fields @xmath3 in the superconductor considerably exceed the lower critical field @xmath4 , and so we put @xmath5 throughout the paper .",
    "beside this , we deal only with bulk superconducting samples , assuming that all their dimensions noticeably exceed the london penetration depth , and we consider the critical state macroscopically , averaging vortex structures and the appropriate microscopic currents over a scale exceeding the intervortex spacing .",
    "hereafter we shall call the critical states `` bean critical states '' if the current density @xmath6 is perpendicular to the local magnetic field @xmath3 at every point of a superconductor , @xmath7 , and thus @xmath8 .",
    "this definition imposes limitations on the direction of the currents in the critical state , but it does not imply constancy of @xmath0 , e.g. , @xmath9 can be as in the kim model .",
    "@xcite the bean critical states can be found from the static maxwell equations , @xmath10 and the conditions on the current density @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the component of the current density along the local magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "such states usually occur when the shape of the superconductor is sufficiently symmetric and the external magnetic field @xmath13 is applied along a symmetry axis , so that the direction of the currents is dictated by the symmetry of the problem .",
    "most of the known solutions of the critical state problem describe just these bean states . for example , this is the well - known solution for an infinite slab in an external magnetic field parallel to its surface , @xcite and also the solution for an infinitely long cylinder with arbitrary cross - section in a magnetic field parallel to its axis since the currents flow perpendicular to this axis .",
    "@xcite bean critical states also occur in infinitely long and thin strips @xcite and in thin disks @xcite in a perpendicular magnetic field even if @xmath0 depends on @xmath14 or on the angle between @xmath1 and the normal to the sample plane .",
    "@xcite if the applied magnetic field is tilted to the plane of an infinitely long strip @xcite or slab @xcite but remains perpendicular to the sample axis , the critical currents flow along this axis , and a bean critical state occurs .",
    "further examples of the bean critical states in samples of a complex shape can be found in ref .  .",
    "a characteristic feature of all these bean critical states is that the perturbation of the current distribution caused by a change of the applied field propagates into the sample as a sharp front at which the direction of the currents changes abruptly .    in real samples of nonsymmetric shape , or when the applied magnetic field changes not only in amplitude but also in its direction , adjacent flux lines may be slightly rotated relative to each other in the critical state .",
    "this rotation generates a component of the current _ along _ the magnetic field , @xcite @xmath15 .",
    "the rotation of flux - lines can lead to their mutual cutting .",
    "@xcite flux line cutting occurs when the component of the current density parallel to the magnetic field , @xmath12 , exceeds some longitudinal critical current density @xmath16 .",
    "in this situation a vortex @xcite or a vortex array @xcite becomes unstable with respect to a helical distortion , and the growth of this distortion leads to flux - line cutting . when both @xmath12 and @xmath0 are equal to their critical values @xmath16 and @xmath0 , respectively , the so - called double critical state @xcite occurs in the superconductor .",
    "@xcite for example , this state appears in some region of a superconducting sample @xcite when a rotating magnetic field of constant magnitude is applied to a superconducting disk ( or slab ) in its plane .",
    "@xcite the double critical state can be still described by eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) , but with the following conditions on the current density @xmath17 : @xmath18 the concept of the critical state with flux - line cutting was further developed in refs .",
    "to explain the observed suppression of the magnetic moment of a superconducting slab under the action of an ac magnetic field .",
    "@xcite    however , in many real situations a change of the direction of the external magnetic field or a nonsymmetric shape of the sample does not lead to flux cutting in the superconductor , i.e. , @xmath12 does not reach @xmath16 in the critical state . in such situations",
    "there is no explicit condition on the magnitude of @xmath12 except that @xmath19 , and the static equations ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) with the only restriction @xmath20 _ are not sufficient _ to find the distributions of the magnetic field @xmath21 and current density @xmath22 in the critical state .",
    "this problem for the special case of a slab with an in - plane magnetic field was solved in refs .  .",
    "the full set of the critical - state equations for arbitrary shape of the sample and for any quasistatic evolution of the vector of the applied magnetic field @xmath13 was obtained in ref .  , where it was also shown that in contrast to the common bean critical states , a perturbation of the current distribution in such critical states propagates into the sample smoothly in a diffusive way .",
    "we emphasize that this class of critical states with @xmath19 corresponds to the general situation , while the common bean critical states and the double critical states are only _ limiting cases _ occurring when @xmath23 or @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "such general critical states , which we shall call the t - critical states ( t means transport ) , @xcite occur even for simple experimental situations . in particular , they appear in a certain region of thin rectangular platelets in a perpendicular magnetic field ( in platelets with thickness exceeding the london penetration depth this is the region which is not penetrated by the perpendicular component of the magnetic field ) .",
    "@xcite critical states of this type also appear at the vortex - shaking in rectangular platelets @xcite and even in strips if the ac field is along the axis of the strips .",
    "@xcite they also occur in low - frequency ac experiments with a slab when a _",
    "circularly _ polarized ac field is applied perpendicularly to the dc magnetic field @xmath25 that is normal to the plane of the slab .",
    "@xcite    as was pointed out in refs .",
    ", one more type of critical states can exist in superconductors . in these states",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath24 , i.e. , only flux cutting occurs without any transport of vortices .",
    "the description of such c - critical states ( c means cutting ) in samples of arbitrary shape can be obtained by an immediate generalization of the approach used in ref .   for a superconducting slab .",
    "below we shall not analyze such states in detail but only briefly outline this generalization .",
    "ii of this paper we develop the approach of ref .  .",
    "in particular , we take into account the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath12 and anisotropy of flux - line pinning .",
    "we also discuss the relationship between the equations of ref .   and the variational principle recently proposed .",
    "@xcite in sec .",
    "iii we then analyze three examples of the general t - critical state .",
    "the critical state is well established in a sample if the characteristic time of change of the applied magnetic field @xmath27 , @xmath28 , considerably exceeds the time of flux flow across the sample , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a characteristic size of the sample and @xmath31 is the flux - flow resistivity . in other words ,",
    "the concept of the critical state can be used for a description of the magnetic - field and current distributions in superconductors if the generated eddy electric fields are relatively small , @xmath32 the ideal critical state thus corresponds to the limit @xmath33 .",
    "below we imply condition ( [ 5 ] ) to be fulfilled .",
    "the general t - critical states with @xmath34 can be described by the following approach : @xcite the static equations ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) are supplemented by the quasistatic maxwell equation @xmath35 where @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the electric field generated by a change of the applied field @xmath13 . for the set of equations ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) , and ( [ 6 ] ) to be solvable , it has to be supplemented by the current - voltage law @xmath38 .",
    "@xcite this law is introduced from two well - known physical ideas : @xmath39 ) at any given @xmath6 and @xmath1 , the _ direction _ of @xmath40 follows from @xmath41 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath42,\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the vortex velocity caused by the lorentz force @xmath44 $ ] . here for simplicity we shall neglect the so - called hall angle , @xcite and so the directions of @xmath45 and the lorentz force coincide .",
    "@xmath46 ) the _ magnitude _ of @xmath40 is found from the condition that @xmath47 which just corresponds to the ideal critical state .    to proceed with our analysis ,",
    "let us introduce the following notations for the magnetic field @xmath48 and the current density @xmath22 in the critical state : @xmath49 , @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the absolute values of the magnetic field and the current density while the unit vectors @xmath53 and @xmath54 define their directions .",
    "then , the component of the current density perpendicular to the magnetic field is given by @xmath55 here the unit vector @xmath56 defines the direction of @xmath57 , @xmath58 ; @xmath59 is the normalizing factor that is equal to the sine of the angle between @xmath3 and @xmath6 , and we have taken into account the condition @xmath60 .",
    "these formulas also lead to the explicit expression for the magnitude @xmath52 of the current density , @xmath61 that is only another form of the condition @xmath62 .",
    "let us now formulate condition ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "let at a moment of time @xmath63 the external magnetic field @xmath64 change infinitesimally by @xmath65 . under the change of @xmath13",
    ", the critical currents locally shift the vortices in the direction of the lorentz force @xmath66 $ ] ; this shift generates an electric field directed along @xmath67={\\bf j}_{\\perp}$ ] , i.e. , along the vector @xmath56 .",
    "thus , we can represent the electric field @xmath68 in the form : @xmath69 where the scalar function @xmath70 is the modulus of the electric field .",
    "note that the electric field in general is not parallel to the total current density @xmath22 . with formulas ( [ 9a ] ) and ( [ 10a ] ) , equations ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) , and ( [ 6 ] )",
    "are sufficient to describe the t - critical states in a sample of arbitrary shape .",
    "it is important that the magnetic fields @xmath48 and currents @xmath22 in the critical state at the moment of time @xmath71 depends only on the field and current distributions in the previous critical state at the moment @xmath63 and on the change of the external field @xmath72 , while the electric field @xmath73 is proportional to the sweep rate @xmath74 rather than to @xmath75 , and so it plays an auxiliary role in solving the critical - state problem .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath73 is now found as a solution of the set of equations ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) , ( [ 6 ] ) , ( [ 9a ] ) , ( [ 10a ] ) without using the specific current - voltage dependence ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "the explicit equation for the scalar function @xmath70 has the form : @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath40 is given by eq .",
    "( [ 10a ] ) .",
    "continuity of the magnetic field on the surface of the superconductor , @xmath77 , yields the boundary condition to eq .",
    "( [ 11a ] ) : @xmath78    \\over 4\\pi r^3}\\ , d { \\bf r}',~    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is a point on the surface @xmath77 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and the integration is carried out over the volume of the sample .",
    "the right hand side of this boundary condition expresses @xmath82 on the surface of the superconductor ( but reaching from outside ) with the use of the biot - savart law .",
    "if in the critical state of the superconductor there are also boundaries at which the direction of the critical currents changes discontinuously or which separate regions with @xmath20 from regions with @xmath83 , @xcite the function @xmath70 has to vanish at these boundaries to provide continuity of the electric field @xmath84 there .    in practical calculations of critical states developing in the process of changing @xmath64",
    "it is convenient to rewrite eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) in the form @xmath85 = -[{\\bf n}\\times { \\rm rot\\ , rot}({\\bf e})],\\ ] ] which is a differential equation for the angles defining the direction of @xmath6 , i.e. , the unit vector @xmath86 .",
    "note that since the distributions of the magnetic fields and currents in the critical states of a superconductor are independent of the sweep rate @xmath87 , their temporal dependence is only a parameterization of their dependence on @xmath13 .",
    "let us now write explicitly the applicability condition of the above theory . since the projection of @xmath6 on the local direction of @xmath3 is @xmath88 , the condition that flux - line cutting is absent leads to the following restriction on the angle between the local @xmath6 and @xmath89 : @xmath90 where @xmath16 is the longitudinal critical current density .",
    "finally , we make several remarks on the electric field .",
    "it may turn out that the electric field @xmath84 obtained with eq .",
    "( [ 11a ] ) does not satisfy the condition @xmath91 .",
    "to clarify this situation , it is necessary to remember that a moving vortex generates an electric dipolar moment , @xcite and hence the moving vortex medium is characterized by the vector of polarization @xmath92 which is the macroscopic density of this moment .",
    "it follows from the results of ref .   that @xmath93 , and a nonzero @xmath94 means that in a type - ii superconductor the electric - charge density @xmath95 appears which generates a curl - free electric field @xmath96 described by the scalar potential @xmath97",
    "this potential field is a part of the total electric field given by @xmath98 inside the sample , and it obeys the equation @xmath99 , i.e. , @xmath100 where @xmath101 . at the surface of the sample , @xmath77 , the field @xmath102 satisfies the same boundary conditions as in the electrostatics of dielectrics : @xcite the tangential components of @xmath102 and the normal component of @xmath103 are continuous there . since @xmath104 outside the sample",
    ", the latter condition means that @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the surface potential fields calculated outside and inside @xmath77 , respectively , and @xmath108 is the normal to @xmath77 pointing outside . the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 14b ] ) gives the surface - charge density induced by moving vortices in the sample .",
    "note that the potential part of @xmath109 does not influence the magnetic fields and currents in the critical state since @xmath110 .",
    "appearance of this part is caused by condition ( [ 10a ] ) that dictates the direction of the electric field in the sample .",
    "although both the inductive part of the electric field , @xmath111 , which generates the critical states , and the potential part @xmath112 can be measured in certain situations , @xcite we shall not analyze electric fields in detail in this paper since these fields plays only an auxiliary role in the critical state problem .",
    "see also the recent book on electric fields .",
    "@xcite    generally speaking , in the process of changing @xmath13 a migration of the induced charges @xmath113 occurs , which leads to a generation of currents satisfying @xmath114 and violating eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "however , these nonstationary currents are proportional to the second power of the sweep rate @xmath74 and are negligible under assumption ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "we now point out some generalizations of the above results which may be useful in analyzing critical states in real situations .",
    "the current - voltage law used in sec .  ii a , eq .  (",
    "[ 8 ] ) , means that flux creep is negligible in our approach . in this case",
    "the critical current density is found from the condition that the creep activation barrier @xmath115 of a vortex bundle is equal to zero .",
    "it has been implied above that @xmath0 may depend on @xmath1 but is completely independent of the magnitude of @xmath12 .",
    "in other words , the form @xmath116 has been assumed for this @xmath115 .",
    "however , the creep activation barrier @xmath115 , generally speaking , may depend not only on @xmath117 and @xmath1 but also on the @xmath12 that characterizes flux - line misalignment in the bundle , i.e. , in the general case one has @xmath118 .",
    "then the critical current density @xmath0 determined from @xmath119 takes the form @xmath120 .",
    "one may expect that this dependence of @xmath0 on the longitudinal current component @xmath12 is especially noticeable when @xmath12 is close to its critical value @xmath16 , and hence @xmath121 in general differs from @xmath122 .",
    "similarly , the activation barrier @xmath123 for flux cutting is a function of both current - density components and of the magnetic induction , i.e. , @xmath124 , and the condition @xmath125 gives @xmath126 . in fig .",
    "1a at a fixed @xmath127 we schematically show the dependences of @xmath0 on @xmath12 and of @xmath16 on @xmath117 in the plane ( @xmath117,@xmath12 ) .",
    "note that these dependences cross when the equations @xmath119 and @xmath128 hold simultaneously .",
    "this occurs at isolated points in the @xmath117-@xmath12 plane since the barriers @xmath115 and @xmath123 characterize different physical processes and are essentially different functions of the current components .",
    "these points correspond to the double critical states when @xmath20 and @xmath129 . in fig .",
    "1a the top / bottom and right / left sections of the curves between the four points describe @xmath130 in the general t - critical state and @xmath131 in the c - critical state .",
    "the dependence @xmath130 leads to a replacement of @xmath132 by @xmath133 in formula ( [ 9a ] ) that now reads @xmath134 the dependence @xmath130 also leads to a modification of eq .",

    "a phenomenological model of the general critical state was considered that described sufficiently well a number of experimental data on the magnetization of a slab and of a disk in magnetic fields parallel to their planes .",
    "in fact , in this model a certain type of the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath12 ( and of @xmath16 on @xmath117 ) was introduced .",
    "even though the directions of the electric field in this model do not satisfy the physical requirement ( [ 10a ] ) , the sufficiently good description of the data seems to indicate the importance of this dependence in real situations .",

    "if similarly to experiments @xcite the in - plane magnetic field is switched on before @xmath165 , completely different critical states will develop .",
    "in this paper we point out how to calculate the general t - critical ( cutting - free ) states in an arbitrarily - shaped type - ii superconductor when the applied magnetic field @xmath13 slowly changes in its magnitude and direction . in accordance with the definition of the general t - critical state",
    ", it is assumed here that the external magnetic field changes in such a manner that flux cutting does not occur in the sample .",
    "our approach enables one to take into account the anisotropy of flux - line pinning and the dependence of the critical current density perpendicular to a local magnetic field , @xmath0 , on the longitudinal component of the current density @xmath12 .",
    "we also show that the variational principle recently proposed @xcite can not give the correct description of the general t - critical states for many situations .",
    "we analyze three examples of the general t - critical states , at least two of which may be investigated experimentally . in particular , we study a seemingly simple problem that has not been solved as yet , viz . , we consider the critical states in a slab placed in a uniform perpendicular magnetic field @xmath165 and then two components of the in - plane magnetic field , @xmath167 and @xmath170 , are applied successively , sec .",
    "iii a. we obtain that one of the in - plane components of the magnetic moment , @xmath259 , becomes positive with increasing @xmath170 for any sign of @xmath259 in the initial state ( i.e. , at @xmath435 ) .",
    "this paramagnetic effect is due to the fact that the currents in the critical states are not perpendicular to the local magnetic fields .",
    "this effect is especially evident when @xmath165 is of the order of the self - fields of the slab .    in the other example",
    ", we analyze the general t - critical states in a long thin strip placed in a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath165 which then tilts towards the axis of the strip @xmath171 , sec .",
    "iii c. when @xmath170 , the axial component of the applied magnetic field , increases , the magnetic - field and current profiles across the width of the strip tend to limiting profiles , and the components of the magnetic moment , @xmath397 and @xmath269 , reach saturation values .",
    "the limiting profiles and the saturation value @xmath409 for @xmath432 are determined by the only parameter @xmath418 where @xmath30 and @xmath301 are the thickness and the width of the strip , respectively , and @xmath436 .",
