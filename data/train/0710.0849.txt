    "let @xmath0 be a numerical variable defined on a population @xmath1 of @xmath2 individuals .",
    "we may think of @xmath3 as an element of a real vector space @xmath4 of dimension @xmath2 .",
    "we equip @xmath5 with a real , normalized scalar product : for @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , we define : @xmath8 the length or norm of a vector is defined in terms of the scalar product : @xmath9 the mean value of a vector @xmath3 is of course the scalar @xmath10 we may also think of the mean value as a vector @xmath11 of @xmath5 having all its components equal to the scalar @xmath12 . in this context @xmath13 may be thought of as a linear operator defined on @xmath14 and mapping @xmath14 into the subspace of constant vectors .",
    "the variance of @xmath3 can be written then as : @xmath15 we now suppose that the indices @xmath16 , correspond to individuals of a population @xmath1 , and that @xmath3 is a numerical variable defined on the population @xmath1 .",
    "we further suppose that @xmath17 is a partition of the population @xmath1 into @xmath18 disjoint classes @xmath19 . denote by @xmath20 the number of elements of @xmath21 , so that @xmath22 .",
    "we can then define a vector @xmath23 with components : @xmath24 observe that two components of this vector are identical if their indices belong to the same class @xmath25 of the partition @xmath17 . the trivial identity : @xmath26 implies @xmath27 because , as it is easily seen , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are orthogonal vectors .",
    "suppose now that @xmath30 is a finite sequence of partitions of the population @xmath1 , into respectively @xmath31 , classes .",
    "suppose further that each partition @xmath32 is a refinement of the partition @xmath33 .",
    "( this means that each class of the partition @xmath34 is contained in a class of the partition @xmath33 ) .",
    "define for completeness the trivial partition @xmath35 consisting of the full population @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath36 , for @xmath37 be the disjoint classes of the population @xmath1 relative to the partition @xmath32 . with reference to the partition",
    "@xmath32 define the operator @xmath38 in this fashion ( 1 ) reads : @xmath39    observe that this definition makes sense also in the case @xmath40 .",
    "the trivial identity @xmath41 + x - e_n(x),\\ ] ] implies , because of the orthogonality of the terms on the right hand side of ( [ dec ] ) , @xmath42 we are interested in the case in which the sequence of partitions @xmath32 is defined by a sequence of qualitative characters @xmath43 of the population @xmath1 .",
    "we can define the partition @xmath32 by considering the classes of the population formed by individuals with identical values of the first @xmath44 characters .",
    "in this case the first @xmath45 summands on the right hand side of ( [ v.dec ] ) represent the contributions to the variance of the @xmath45 qualitative characters @xmath46 within the population considered .",
    "observe however that , while the sum of the first @xmath45 terms of the right hand side of ( [ v.dec ] ) is independent of the order in which the characters @xmath46 are considered , the operators @xmath47 , for @xmath48 are defined with respect to partitions which strongly depend on the order in which the characters are taken . as an obvious consequence , the value of each term @xmath49 also depends on the order of the characters . in a different order the characters would define a different set of partitions ; only @xmath35 and @xmath50 , and consequently @xmath13 and @xmath51 are independent of the chosen order .",
    "we are led therefore to look for a natural order of the qualitative characters considered .",
    "we propose an ordering based on systematic , step by step , comparisons of the conditional means with respect to the variables considered .",
    "this ordering , which we call _ stepwise optimal ordering _ ( soo ) is defined as follows :    we choose the character @xmath52 and the corresponding partition @xmath53 which maximizes @xmath54 .",
    "if @xmath55 are chosen , the character @xmath56 is chosen so that it refines the partition @xmath57 into the partition @xmath58 in such a way that the value @xmath59 is largest .",
    "the order @xmath46 determined in this fashion may be considered as a ranking of the variables .",
    "one should be aware , however , that this ranking can not be interpreted in terms of relative importance in determining the phenomenon measured by the variable @xmath3 .",
    "as will be seen in the applications below , the qualitative characters considered may be far from independent .",
    "this may imply that a character which is recognized as a primary cause of the intensity of the phenomenon measured by @xmath3 , may be mediated by other characters to whom it is associated , and therefore appear in the last positions of the ranking .",
    "we do not propose a clear cut interpretation of the significance of the ranking obtained by our method , nor of the relative size of the first @xmath45 addends which appear in ( [ v.dec ] ) , when the qualitative characters are ordered according to our prescription . on the contrary , rather than expecting straight answers",
    ", we expect that both the ranking and the relative size of the addends in the expression ( [ v.dec ] ) would solicit questions concerning the dependence of the variable @xmath3 on the qualitative variables and the interdependence of the qualitative variables themselves ( with all the cautions regarding the possibility to consider causal relations between the variables , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , in the very special case considered in the simulated experiment of , our method yields a ranking that reflects the relative weight of the characters .    in the following two sections",
    "we apply our method and discuss the `` ranking '' of the qualitative characters , thus obtained to the two sets of data mentioned in the abstract .",
    "the fourth section is dedicated to a simulated experiment .",
    "we should mention that the ideas contained in chapter 8d of @xcite were influential in the inception of this work , which started as an attempt to apply diaconis ideas to the case of tree - structured data , under the action of the group of tree - automorphisms . under this action the ranges of the operators",
    "@xmath60 turn out to be irreducible subspaces of @xmath14 .",
    "entering students of the university of rome `` la sapienza '' in scientific and technical fields take a multiple choice test in mathematics , which consists of @xmath61 questions .",
    "the test , in italian , may be downloaded at @xcite . at the moment",
    "the purpose of the test is to discourage students who do not have an adequate background , and to make students aware of their potential weaknesses .",
    "we consider a population of @xmath62 students who took the test in 2005 , and we let @xmath3 be the score achieved by each student , that is the number of correct answers .",
    "the variable @xmath3 depends on the @xmath61 dyadic characters , corresponding to the correct or incorrect answer to each question .",
    "of course , in this case , @xmath63 , and @xmath64    the variable @xmath3 takes values between @xmath65 and @xmath61 .",
    "its mean value is @xmath66 and the variance is @xmath67 .",
    "the histogram of @xmath3 is in fig",
    "the histogram of the score.,width=302 ]    an application of our method shows that just ten questions , chosen according to the ranking we propose , `` explain '' @xmath68 of the variance . in other words , if we write @xmath69 the remainder term @xmath70 amounts to just @xmath71 of @xmath72 .",
    "we presently list the remainders @xmath73 , for @xmath74 , obtained by applying our method , as percentage of @xmath75 . to wit",
    "the values @xmath76 , @xmath77    we do not claim , of course , that our method necessarily chooses the @xmath78 characters for which @xmath79 is lowest . in general , with arbitrary data , this may not be the case .",
    "however , in this particular case , our choice compares well with other possible choices , as shown by the experiment which we presently describe .",
    "we selected , at random , @xmath80 subsets of ten elements of the original thirty questions and we computed the conditional mean @xmath81 with respect to the partition @xmath17 obtained by grouping together the students with identical performance on each of the ten question chosen .",
    "we computed then @xmath82 relative to each ten element choice .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "histogram of the values of residual variance ( 4 ) , as percentage of total variance for @xmath80 randomly selected subsets of @xmath78 questions.,width=302 ]    observe that the lowest value of quantity ( 4 ) achieved by one of the @xmath80 subsets we selected , is higher than @xmath83 , while with our choice of a subset of characters , we achieved a value of @xmath84 .",
    "the experiment shows that the algorithm we propose performs decidedly better than a random choice if we want to choose ten out of thirty questions , in such a way that the total variance of the variable @xmath3 is best explained . in conclusion",
    "there is at least some experimental evidence that our method may be used to select a small number of characters which account for most of the variance .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results with the results obtained with linear regression .",
    "we found that the agreement between the results is strong .",
    "eight of the ten variables selected by soo are among the ten most important variables in terms of linear regression .",
    "furthermore , the order of the first five variables coincides with both methods .",
    "we also observed that the variables selected according to soo have the properties of discriminating the students ( the differences of percentages of correct and incorrect answers is small ) .",
    "the italian system of higher education is characterized by the marked difference between the time employed by most students to complete a degree and the number of years formally required to graduate .",
    "the average delay in completing a degree is well above two years for most fields of study . in this section",
    "we consider a population of italian university graduates obtained using the data bank `` almalaurea '' which collects data of university graduates from a set of italian universities",
    ". the population amounts to 58,091 graduates of 27 universities in 2003 . on this population",
    "the variable @xmath3 represents the delay in completing the degree , computed in years , starting from a conventional date ( november 1st ) in which according to formal regulations the degree should have been completed .",
    "we excluded delays above ten years , which should be better interpreted as leaving and resuming the studies after several years .",
    "we study the dependence of @xmath3 on seven possible characters , which are the following :    ( un ) university where the degree was obtained    ( pe ) parent s level of education    ( hs ) type of high school attended    ( gd ) grade in the final year of high school    ( ma ) degree major    ( wo ) working or not working during the studies    ( gn ) gender    proceeding as outlined in the introduction , we obtain the following ranking of the seven variables :    gd , un , ma , hs , pe , wo , gn .    accordingly we consider the operators @xmath85 and write @xmath86    the variance of the variable @xmath3 is @xmath87 , while the residual variance , not `` explained '' by the qualitative variables under consideration is @xmath88 .",
    "the decomposition of the variance ( [ v.dec ] ) is : @xmath89 thus @xmath90 represents the portion of the variance which is `` explained '' by the characters considered .",
    "we may say , therefore , that these characters explain @xmath91 of the variance .    in this case",
    "the ranking obtained by our method is relatively `` robust '' .",
    "indeed if we omit consideration of one of the characters , the relative ranking of the other characters remains unchanged .",
    "we do not claim of course that this type of `` robustness '' is inherent in our method .",
    "it may very well occur , with different data , that omitting one character would determine a change in the order of the remaining characters .",
    "we compared our results with the results obtained by using the binomial logistic regression .",
    "the delay in obtaining the degree becomes dicotomic assigning value zero to the population of graduates with a delay less than one year ( @xmath92 ) and value one to the others ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "the results of our computations are shown in table 1 .",
    ".binomial logistic regression of the seven variables . in the column `` variance '' is computed the variance of probability variation . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we observe that also in this case the rank in terms of size of the variances coincides , except for one inversion , with the ranking obtained by soo .",
    "it should be noted however that the application of binomial logistic regression implies an arbitrary dicotomization of the variable .",
    "moreover , it is questionable in this case that the binomial logistic regression would add information of inferential value , because its application leads to many classes which are empty or with few individuals .",
    "histogram of the delay.,width=302 ]",
    "in order to better understand the properties of our stepwise optimal order , we performed a simulation , repeating @xmath94 times the following experiment .",
    "first we constructed @xmath78 vectors @xmath95 each of @xmath96 components and each component extracted from a simulated bernoulli variable .",
    "then we considered the variable @xmath97 with @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 consisting of @xmath96 independent realizations of a simulated gaussian variable with mean @xmath65 and standard deviation @xmath101 .    in @xmath102 cases out of the @xmath94 observed experiments , soo was exactly @xmath103 , i.e. for the variable @xmath104 this order reflected , most of the time , the size of the coefficients @xmath105 which enter formula ( [ * ] ) . in the remaining two case",
    "the difference between soo and the increasing order was just one inversion .",
