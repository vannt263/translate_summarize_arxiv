    "top quark production in association with two jets constitutes an important background for many new particle searches at the tevatron and at the lhc .",
    "prominent examples include searches for higgs boson decays @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where the higgs boson is produced via weak boson fusion or via an associated production with a @xmath0 pair respectively .",
    "higgs boson production in association with top quarks has a strongly decreasing cross section with increasing higgs boson mass , which makes the process useful only in the low mass range , @xmath7 , when higgs boson decays in @xmath8 are important .",
    "this potential discovery channel gives a unique access to the top and bottom yukawa couplings .",
    "combined analyzes of atlas @xcite and cms @xcite have shown that a @xmath9 evidence of the signal above the dominant @xmath10 and @xmath11 backgrounds can be obtained for @xmath12 gev at the lhc , if enough luminosity , @xmath13 , is collected . however",
    ", a reconstruction of the @xmath14 mass peak is difficult because of an identification problem in the signal .",
    "the @xmath8 pair can be chosen incorrectly , due to a lack of a distinctive kinematic feature of jets from the higgs boson decay .",
    "moreover , the b - tagging efficiency takes a crucial part in this kind of analyzes , since two b - jets for a higgs boson candidate can arise from mistagged light jets .",
    "therefore , a very precise knowledge of the backgrounds is necessary , if the @xmath15 channel is to be of any use .",
    "on the other hand , a detailed atlas examination of the vector boson fusion channel at the lhc , @xmath16 , has shown that a significance larger than @xmath9 can be obtained for a luminosity of @xmath17 in the higgs boson mass range above @xmath18 130 gev , _",
    "i.e. _ when @xmath19 is large enough @xcite .",
    "when combining this channel with the @xmath20 mode , one can even obtain a @xmath21 significance for the above mass range .",
    "in fact , the @xmath22 channel becomes very powerful at higher higgs boson masses .",
    "one can arrive at a signal significance that is above @xmath23 in a wide mass range , namely from @xmath24 up to @xmath25 , for the same luminosity .",
    "although feasible and competitive , this channel might prove to be rather difficult since the higgs boson mass peak can not be directly reconstructed .",
    "consequently , one can not measure background processes from the side bands .",
    "the most important background processes , @xmath11 and qcd @xmath26 , need to be known , therefore , as precisely as possible",
    ".    meanwhile at the tevatron , with up to @xmath27 of data analyzed at cdf , and up to @xmath28 at d0 , the higgs boson mass range of @xmath29 has been excluded @xcite .",
    "very recently , the lhc experiments have presented their higgs boson search results based on @xmath30 of analyzed data .",
    "cms has excluded the standard model higgs boson in the @xmath31 gev and @xmath32 gev windows @xcite , while atlas has excluded the @xmath33 gev and @xmath34 gev windows @xcite .",
    "the low mass exclusion is dominated by the search of the @xmath35 final state , while the high mass one is dominated by @xmath36 with three different combinations of z decays .",
    "considering these recent experimental results , an excellent understanding of lighter higgs boson search channels is more timely than ever .    apart from its significance as a background process to various new physics searches it turns out that @xmath11 production can also be an important signal process . with the total integrated luminosity accumulated so far at the tevatron around @xmath37 events",
    "should have been collected so far by each experiment . as for the lhc , in june of this year both experiments atlas and cms reached @xmath30 of collected data .",
    "this can be directly translated to about @xmath38 events already stored .",
    "since they are in the process of collecting data , the @xmath11 process can soon become of great importance for a more precise understanding of the top quark events topology .",
    "however , it is a well known fact that for processes involving strongly interacting particles , the leading order ( lo ) cross sections are affected by large uncertainties arising from higher order corrections .",
    "if , at least , next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections to these processes are included , total cross sections can be defined in a reliable way .",
    "the nlo qcd corrections to @xmath39 production have already been calculated by two independent groups @xcite , and perfect agreement has been found .",
    "in addition , nlo corrections to the remaining two background processes , namely @xmath40 @xcite and @xmath41 @xcite have recently been evaluated . in this paper",
    ", we have extend our previous study on the nlo qcd corrections to the @xmath41 production at the lhc , where the integrated cross section together with the scale dependence of the total cross section for one particular set of cuts for the center of mass system energy of @xmath42 have been studied .",
    "moreover , we have presented there three differential distributions , the invariant mass distribution of the first and the second hardest jet together with the transverse momentum distributions of the first and the second hard jet .",
    "we supplement this discussion here with more results .",
    "in particular , results for the tevatron case are going to be presented for the first time . in case of the lhc",
    ", we use the current center of mass system energy of @xmath43 . additionally to the integrated cross sections for different setups ,",
    "various differential distributions are given .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ sec:1 ]",
    "we briefly summarize the methods we use to obtain our nlo qcd results . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "numerical results are presented , first for the tevatron and later on for the lhc case .",
    "we give our conclusions in section [ sec:3 ] .",
    "finally , in an appendix we give values of squared matrix elements for the virtual corrections for one phase space point .",
    "the calculation of nlo corrections to hadronic top pair production in association with two jets proceeds along the same lines as our earlier work on @xmath44 @xcite , @xmath41 @xcite and @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the methods developed there have therefore been straightforwardly adapted and only need a brief recollection here .",
    "let us emphasize , that all parts of the calculation are performed fully numerically in a completely automatic manner .",
    "at tree level the @xmath0 production in association with two jets proceeds via the scattering of two gluons , two quarks or quark and gluon .",
    "all contributions of the order of @xmath46 can be grouped into eight easily identifiable topologies presented in the table [ tab : lo ] .",
