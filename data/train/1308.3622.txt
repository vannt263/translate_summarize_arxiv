    "the quantum nature of phenomena is one of the most exciting experiences a physics student can live .",
    "what is being proposed here has to do with light bullets , bunches of photons emitted in a few nanoseconds by an ultra - fast led and sensed by a state - of - the - art detector , a silicon photo - multiplier ( hereafter , sipm ) .",
    "sipm can count the number of impacting photons , shot by shot , opening up the possibility to apply basic skills in probability and statistics while playing with light quanta .",
    "after an introduction to the sipm sensor technology ( section  [ counting photons ] ) , the basics of the statistical properties of the random process of light emission and the sensor related effects are introduced ( section  [ photon counting statistics ] ) .",
    "the experimental and data analysis techniques are described in section  [ experimental techniques . ] , while results and discussions are reported in section  [ randd ] .",
    "sipms are cutting edge light detectors essentially consisting of a matrix of photodiodes with a common output and densities up to @xmath0 .",
    "each diode is operated in a limited geiger - muller regime in order to achieve gains at the level of @xmath1 and guarantee an extremely high homogeneity in the cell - to - cell response .",
    "subject to the high electric field in the depletion zone , initial charge carriers generated by an absorbed photon or by thermal effects trigger an exponential charge multiplication by impact ionization , till when the current spike across the quenching resistance induces a drop in the operating voltage , stopping the process @xcite .",
    "sipm can be seen as a collection of binary cells , providing altogether an information about the intensity of the incoming light by counting the number of fired cells .",
    "[ fig : oscilloscope ] shows the typical response by a sipm to a light pulse : traces correspond to different numbers of fired cells , proportional to the number of impinging photons . because of the high gain compared to the noise level , traces are well separated , providing a photon number resolved detection of the light field .",
    "this is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exemplaryhistogram ] , displaying the spectrum of the sipm response to a high statistics of pulses : every entry corresponds to the digitized released charge , measured integrating the electrical current spike during a pre - defined time interval .",
    "the peaks correspond to different number of cells fired at the same time .",
    "each peak is well separated and occurs with a probability linked at first order to the light intensity fluctuations .",
    "an analysis of the histogram is revealing other significant characteristics : +    * the peak at @xmath2 corresponds to no detected photons and its width measures the noise of the system , i.e. the stochastic fluctuations in the output signal in absence of any stimulus . in the displayed histogram , @xmath3  =  29@xmath4 adc channels .",
    "+ * the peak at 1 detected photon has a width @xmath5  =  38.1@xmath60.4 adc channels , by far exceeding @xmath3 .",
    "the extra contribution may be related to the fact that not all of the cells were born equal . in sipm",
    "the homogeneity of the response is quite high @xcite , however , since fired cells are randomly distributed in the detector sensitive area residual differences in the gain become evident broadening the peak . + * as a consequence the peak width is increasing with the number n of fired cells with a growth expected to follow a @xmath7 law , eventually limiting the maximum number _",

    "effects broadening the peaks may grow faster dumping the expected resolution . among these effects",
    "it is worth mentioning dark counts , optical cross - talk and after - pulsing : +    * free charge carriers may also be thermally generated .",
    "results are spurious avalanches ( dark counts ) occurring randomly and independently from the illumination field .",
    "the dark count rate ( dcr ) does depend from several factors : substrate , processing technology , sensor design and operating temperature @xcite .",
    "the over - voltage has an impact since the junction thickness volume grows with it together with the triggering probability , namely the probability that a charge carrier develops an avalanche @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the dcr can be measured in different ways .",

    "[ fig : staircase ] where the output from a sensor is compared to the threshold of a discriminator and the rate with which the threshold is exceeded is counted .",
    "a typical dcr is about @xmath13 . +",
    "* dark counts may be considered as statistically independent . however , optical photons developed during an avalanche have been shown to trigger secondary avalanches @xcite involving more than one cell into spurious pulses .",
    "this phenomenon is named optical cross - talk ( oct ) .",
    "the oct is affected by the sensor technology @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite and strongly depends on the bias voltage increasing the triggering probability and the gain forming the optical photon burst .",
    "the oct can be measured by the ratio of the dark counts frequencies for pulses exceeding the 0.5 and 1.5 levels of the single cell amplitude , namely : + @xmath14 +   + the oct typically ranges between 10% and 20% @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . + * charge carriers from an initial avalanche may be trapped by impurities and released at later stage resulting in delayed avalanches named after - pulses . for the detectors in use here , an after - pulse rate at about the 25% level has been reported for an overvoltage @xmath15 , with a linear dependence on @xmath9 and a two - component exponential decay time of 15 @xmath16 and 80 @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "+    dark counts , optical cross - talk and after - pulses occur stochastically and introduce fluctuations in the multiplication process that contribute to broaden the peaks in the spectrum . an exhaustive study of this effect , also known as excess noise factor ( enf ) , exceeds the goals of this work and will not be addressed here ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "occurrences may be considered statistically independent , with a decay probability within a time interval @xmath17 proportional to @xmath17 itself .",
    "being so , the statistics of the number of photons emitted within a finite time interval t is expected to be poissonian , namely :    @xmath18     + where @xmath19 is the mean number of emitted photons .",
    "the detection of the incoming photons has a stochastic nature as well , at the simplest possible order governed by the photon detection probability ( pde ) @xmath20 , resulting in a binomial probability to detect @xmath21 photons out of @xmath22 :    @xmath23    as a consequence , the distribution @xmath24 of the number of detected photons is linked to the distribution @xmath25 of the number of generated photons by    @xmath26    however , the photon statistics is preserved and @xmath24 is actually a poissonian distribution of mean value @xmath27 @xcite , @xcite . for the sake of completeness , the demonstration is reported in appendix a.    detector effects ( especially oct and after - pulses ) can actually modify the original photo - electron probability density function , leading to significant deviations from a pure poisson distribution .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , oct can be accounted for by a parameter @xmath28 , corresponding to the probability of an avalanche to trigger a secondary cell .",
    "the probability density function of the number of fired cells , the random discrete variable @xmath29 , can be written at first order as :    @xmath30     + where _ floor _ rounds @xmath29/2 to the nearest lower integer and @xmath31 is the binomial probability for @xmath32 cells fired by a photon to generate @xmath33 extra hit by oct .",
    "@xmath34 is characterized by a mean value and variance expressed as :    @xmath35    in order to perform a more refined analysis , the probability density function of the total number of detected pulses can be calculated taking into account higher order effects @xcite .",
    "the result is achieved by assuming that every primary event may produce a single infinite chain of secondary pulses with the same probability @xmath28 . neglecting the probability for an event to trigger more than one cell",
    ", the number of secondary hits , described by the random discrete variable @xmath33 , follows a geometric distribution with parameter @xmath28 :    @xmath36    the number of primary detected pulses is denoted by the random discrete variable @xmath37 and belongs to a poisson distribution with mean value @xmath38 . as a consequence ,",
