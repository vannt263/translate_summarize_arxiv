    "a series of unexpected astrophysical observations have failed to find explanations in terms of standard astrophysical or particle physics models  @xcite .",
    "each of these anomalies can be explained , however , if there exists a dark weakly interacting massive particle , wimp , belonging to a secluded gauge sector  @xcite . a dark vector boson ,",
    "@xmath0 , an abelian gauge field , may couple the secluded sector to the standard model through its kinetic mixing with the standard model electroweak hypercharge gauge field , @xmath4 .",
    "the kinetic mixing parameter , @xmath5 , is expected to be of the order @xmath6@xmath7 which allows for observable effects in @xmath8(gev)-energy @xmath9@xmath10 colliders @xcite .",
    "the u  boson might be produced in such collider experiments via several processes : @xmath11 decays , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are vector and pseudoscalar mesons , @xmath2 with @xmath14 , where @xmath15 or @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ( dark higgsstrahlung ) , where @xmath18 is a higgs - like particle responsible for breaking the hidden symmetry .",
    "the kloe experiment operated from 2000 to 2006 at da@xmath1ne , the frascati @xmath19 factory .",
    "da@xmath1ne is an @xmath9@xmath10 collider running mainly at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath201.0195  gev , the mass of the @xmath19 meson .",
    "equal energy electron and positron beams collide at an angle of @xmath2025  mrad , producing @xmath19 mesons nearly at rest .",
    "the detector consists of a large cylindrical drift chamber ( dc )  @xcite , providing a momentum resolution of @xmath21 0.4 , surrounded by a lead - scintillating fiber electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc )  @xcite providing an energy resolution of @xmath22 and a time resolution of @xmath23 = 57  @xmath24  100  ps . a superconducting coil around the emc provides a 0.52  t field .",
    "the kloe-2 collaboration has completed three searches for a dark photon .",
    "the first two searched for u  boson in vector meson decays @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 with the pseudoscalar meson decaying via @xmath28  @xcite and @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "kloe-2 provided another limit for u  boson production using the process @xmath30",
    ", @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "a fourth dark force analysis has been performed by kloe-2 by searching for the u  boson in the dark higgsstrahlung process , @xmath17 . a preliminary limit on the product of the dark coupling strength and the kinetic mixing strength , @xmath32 , will be published soon .",
    "the first three analyses produced excellent limits in the parameter space @xmath35 versus @xmath36 , but some values of @xmath5 and @xmath36 that can explain the @xmath37 anomaly have not yet been excluded . in particular",
    "we would like to probe the range @xmath38  me-.07em v-.09em /-.08em c@xmath39 to either find evidence for an explanation of the muon anomaly or completely exclude the dark photon as a possible explanation . at an @xmath40 collider like da@xmath1ne , it s possible that the electron and positron can annihilate , or scatter , producing a u  boson and a photon , with the decay of the u  boson into a pair of leptons . unlike the previous kloe-2 limits , the sensitivity from the @xmath41 channel is expected to increase as @xmath36 aproaches @xmath42 due to the dramatic increase in the u  boson production cross section , @xmath43 where we have electrons as our final - state leptons ( @xmath44 ) and @xmath45 is the total width .",
    "a new kloe-2 analysis is underway which proposes to search for u  boson production in the process @xmath30",
    ", @xmath27 .",
    "the 3 final - state particles of this process are the same as radiative bhabha scattering .",
    "the distinct feature we are searching for is a breit - wigner resonant production peak ( at the u  boson mass ) in the invariant - mass distribution of the @xmath40 pair . to search for",
    "a u  boson produced at a fixed - energy @xmath9@xmath10 collider we use initial - state radiation ( isr ) to reduce the center of mass energy and thereby scan the range of possible u  boson masses down to @xmath42 .",
    "the process consists of finite - width effects for @xmath46-channel annihilation subprocesses , non - resonant @xmath47-channel u  boson exchange , and @xmath46-@xmath47 interference contributions .",
    "the finite - width effects are order @xmath48 on the integrated cross section so are much smaller than any potential resonance we would observe , but they are critical from a phenomonological perspective and are properly taken into account in the monte carlo simulation  @xcite .",
    "the non - resonant @xmath47-channel effects would not produce the breit - wigner peak in the invariant mass distribution but could , in principle , show up in analyses of angular distributions or asymmetries .",
    "the kloe-2 analysis will focus exclusively on resonant @xmath46-channel u  boson production .",
    "using about 1.5  fb@xmath49 of kloe data collected during 20042005 we will search for u  boson production in a sample of radiative bhabha scattering events .",
    "the strategy is to select events with the final - state electron , positron , and photon , all emitted at large angle ( @xmath50 ) with respect to the beam axis , such that they are explicitly detected in the barrel of the calorimeter .",
    "the @xmath51 variable , computed using energy and momentum conservation , with the assumption of equal - mass oppositely - charged particles , will be used to separate electrons from the more massive muons and pions .",
    "we will use monte carlo ( mc ) simulations to estimate the level of background contamination due to the following processes : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 ( where one photon converts into an @xmath40 pair ) , and @xmath55 , as well as other @xmath19 decays . due to the kloe detector s excellent efficiency at detecting electrons and distinguishing them from heavier charged particles",
    ", we estimate that the sum of all background processes is typically less than 1% in the @xmath56 distribution .",
    "none of the background shapes are peaked , eliminating the possiblility of a background mimicking the resonant u  boson signal .",
    "several monte carlo event generators for radiative bhabha scattering fail to accurately reproduce the physics at the dielectron mass threshold due to numerical instabilities in integrations of the form @xmath57 . due to the three order - of - magnitude difference between the electron mass and the center - of - mass energy of the collision , numerical instabilities arise as @xmath58 approaches threshold where the square root gives 0 , but as @xmath58 becomes larger than @xmath59 the factor @xmath60 becomes dominant .",
    "these problems are apparent when the simulated cross section fails to show the significant rise at threshold . together with the authors of babayaga we modified the babayaga - nlo  @xcite event generator and implemented it into our full kloe simulation such that the weighted events are distributed throughout the phase space with the square of the matrix element providing the correct weight . the good agreement between our mc simulation using the new event generator and our selected data sample",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_ee_distribution ] .",
    "no signal peak has been observed so far .",
    "a preliminary excercise was performed on measured data using the cls technique  @xcite to determine a preliminary limit on the number of signal u  boson events , @xmath61 , at 90% confidence level .",
    "chebyshev polynomials were fit to the measured data ( @xmath6215@xmath63 ) , excluding the signal region of interest ( @xmath623@xmath63 ) , and were used as the background .",
    "a breit - wigner peak smeared with the invariant mass resolution was used as the signal .",
    "we then translated this limit on @xmath61 to a 90% confidence level limit on the kinetic mixing parameter as a function of @xmath56 as  @xcite @xmath64 where the radiator function @xmath65 was extracted from @xmath66 using the phokhara mc simulation  @xcite to determine the radiative differential cross section , @xmath67 is the integral of the cross section ( [ eq : ubos_cross_sec ] ) , and @xmath68  fb@xmath49 is the integrated luminosity . the selection efficiency , @xmath69 , was obtained from a babayaga mc simulation where the radiative bhabha scattering was only allowed to proceed via the annihilation channel , since that is the channel in which the u  boson breit - wigner resonance would occur ; the @xmath47-channel ultimately becoming a background .",
    "our preliminary limit is shown in fig .  [",

    "we outlined our strategy for a new dark gauge u  boson search in the process @xmath2 with @xmath3 using @xmath201.5  fb@xmath49 of kloe data collected in 20042005 .",
    "after a preliminary excercise , we found no evidence for the existence of a u  boson and set a preliminary upper limit at @xmath73@xmath74 on the level of kinetic mixing with the standard model as a function of the u  boson mass in the range 10520  mev / c@xmath75 .",
    "a final result is forthcoming and should extend the limit closer to the dielectron mass threshold .",
    "the upgraded kloe-2 experiment  @xcite , currently running , uses a new cylindrical gem inner tracker  @xcite providing higher resolution interaction vertexing , and plans to collect upwards of 10  fb@xmath49 of data . the increased statistical power and tracking / vertexing sensitivity will allow kloe-2 to significantly extend our present limits .",
