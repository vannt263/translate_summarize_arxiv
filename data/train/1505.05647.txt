    "nuclear time - dependent mean - field based on the energy density functional approach is experiencing nowadays a renewal of interest @xcite .",
    "in particular , it allows one to describe a wide variety of dynamical processes ranging from small to large amplitude collective motions , including nuclear reactions . among the most difficult challenges",
    ", one can mention the description of nuclear fission where a single nucleus encounters large deformation leading finally to separated fragments .",
    "although the fission process is quite well understood phenomenologically @xcite , it still remains one of the most difficult process to describe microscopically .",
    "one of the major difficulty is the necessity to treat collective and single - particle degrees of freedom ( dof ) simultaneously as quantum objects @xcite .",
    "moreover , fission is a dynamical process and therefore should be treated as such . to describe the dynamic of fission",
    ", one can a priori use two strategies .",
    "using the fact that the time - scale associated to fission is rather large , the most common starting point is to first select a few collective dofs and generate an adiabatic energy landscape .",
    "then , the time - scale associated to fission can be evaluated using semi - classical approximation .",
    "alternatively , the real time dynamic can be explicitly followed using for instance the time - dependent generator coordinates method @xcite .",
    "two important problems are generally encountered in this strategy .",
    "first , this approach can hardly accommodate too many collective dofs due to the increasing complexity .",
    "second , while rather slow , the dynamic of fission might deviate from the completely adiabatic path when the two fragments approach the scission .",
    "an alternative strategy is to use microscopic quantum transport theories such as the time - dependent energy density functional ( td - edf ) theory .",
    "this approach offers the possibility to describe some aspects of the fission process without assuming adiabaticity while leaving the possibility to explore rather complex shapes during the separation process .",
    "in addition , the recent inclusion of dynamical pairing has opened new perspectives @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the td - edf approach can not describe completely the fission process due to the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking and due to poor treatment of quantal effects in collective space .",
    "however , it can still provide important information in particular after the system has passed the fission barrier .",
    "this has been illustrated in refs .",
    "@xcite and more recently in ref .",
    ".    the td - edf directly performs the evolution of single - particle states in a self - consistent mean - field . from this evolution",
    ", one can directly infer the information on any one - body degree of freedom like multipole deformation , neck formation and/or fragment separation , final kinetic energies ... the aim of the present work is to explore the possibility to get macroscopic transport coefficients , like collective mass , collective potential or energy dissipation , directly from td - edf . in particular , this should allow us to compare the result of td - edf to similar quantities generally obtained in the adiabatic limit and/or macroscopic models .    in the following ,",
    "we analyze first how collective masses and momenta can be associated to given collective observables along a microscopic mean - field path .",
    "once the pairs of conjugated operators are available , a macroscopic reduction of the microscopic approach can be made to give physical insights .",
    "for the fission process , the energy sharing between internal and selected dofs can be precisely scrutinized .",
    "in the present section , we assume that the mean - field trajectory including or not pairing is known , leading to a specific trajectory in the liouville space of the normal and anomalous density matrices @xmath1 . starting from these densities , we want to extract information on a set of given collective variables .",
    "note that , although we present examples specifically on the fission process , the approach developed here is general and can be applied to other processes .",
    "let us consider a given collective dof associated to the one - body operator @xmath2 .",
    "we restrict the present discussion to the case where @xmath2 corresponds to a local one - body operator , i.e. @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the creation / annihilation operators of a particle at position @xmath6 . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we omitted the spin and isospin quantum numbers .",
    "note that most macroscopic dofs of interest like multipole operators , relative distance , mass asymmetry , ... correspond to expectation values of local one - body operators .    along the mean - field trajectory",
    ", the collective evolution is given by : @xmath7 where we have introduced the local density @xmath8 .",
    "the first step to bridge the microscopic mean - field theory and a macroscopic like evolution for the collective variable @xmath9 is to find the corresponding conjugated momentum @xmath10 and associated collective mass , denoted by @xmath11 . assuming a classical equation of motion for @xmath9 , one should fulfill the simple constraint @xmath12 . in the td - edf approach",

    ", one can easily see that the matrix elements of the operator @xmath19 are given by : @xmath20 that is similar to the expression obtained in @xcite using a variational principle around a static mean - field to study anharmonic effects in giant resonances .",
    "one shortcoming of the above expression is that the operator @xmath19 contains the collective mass @xmath11 that is unknown . to further progress ,",
    "we seek for the condition that @xmath21 are conjugated observables .",
    "similarly to the time - dependent rpa ( tdrpa ) , we need to impose the condition : @xmath22\\right)= i\\hbar \\label{eq : conj } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] along the trajectory .",

    "we see that the condition ( [ eq : conj ] ) determines uniquely the collective mass through : @xmath24 \\label{eq : mass1 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all along the trajectory and henceforth also leads to an unambiguous definition of the collective momentum @xmath19 when reporting the mass in eq .",
    "( [ eq : momentum ] ) .",
    "similar formula is sometimes used to compute collective mass from a microscopic adiabatic energy landscape ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the difference is that this expression has been derived here without assuming adiabaticity .",
    "in addition , since the expectation value is directly performed using the time - dependent mean - field density it automatically contains possible influence of other dofs as well as the pairing effects .",
    "the mass formula ( [ eq : mass1 ] ) is rather straightforward to calculate .",
    "we give illustration of some expression obtained for specific collective operators in appendix [ sec : appendix ] .",
    "once the mass and the momentum are known , one can also define the collective kinetic energy corresponding to the selected variable as @xmath25      let us now consider a more general case where a set of @xmath26 collective dofs @xmath27 are selected .",
    "a naive generalization to previous section is to assign to each variable @xmath28 , a collective momentum @xmath29 with matrix elements given by eq .",

    "as shown in appendix [ sec : mdiag ] , the diagonalization of the mass gives new canonical pairs of collective operators @xmath32 , whose commutation rules identifies with the tdrpa ones and are given by @xmath33 \\rangle = i\\hbar \\delta_{kl } .",
    "\\label{eq : conjstrong } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the diagonalization is equivalent also to removing the correlation among the variables like multipole moments .",
    "these new operators are particularly useful to get simple expressions for the evolution and collective energy .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath34 while the collective kinetic energy is simply given by @xmath35    once the set of collective variables is properly defined , macroscopic analysis of td - edf evolution can be made .",
    "such a connection from the microscopic level to the macroscopic one is illustrated below for the fission process .",
    "to illustrate the method presented in the previous section , we consider the case of @xmath0fm that was the subject of the recent work @xcite .",

    "since symmetry can not be broken spontaneously by mean - field , only even multipole moments can be non - zero during the evolution .",
    "in particular , we do not consider here possible octupole deformation .    as it was observed previously including or not pairing , the system will spontaneously separate into two fragments only above a certain value of the initial quadrupole moment , which is larger than that of the fission barrier shown in fig .",

    "many crossing occurs .",
    "when one leaves the system initially in the shaded area , single - particle wave functions will evolve in time .",
    "however , the motion is not adiabatic and both occupations above and below the fermi energy will be populated in time . the pec is meaningful only if lowest levels are preferentially occupied during the evolution while higher levels are depopulated . td - edf including or not pairing does not lead to sufficient reorganization of single - particle occupation numbers during the crossing to follow the adiabatic pec as it has already been realized in refs .",
    "as studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , the system initialized inside the shaded area can still fission if , for instance , a boost in the quadrupole momentum is applied at initial time . in practice ,",
    "the boost is imposed by applying the local operator @xmath57 to each single - particle wave - function .",

    "the scission point corresponding to a quadrupole deformation @xmath61 can already be seen in the shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pes ] .",
    "it corresponds to the kink in the pec appearing at @xmath62 b. after the scission point , the pec is nearly dominated by the coulomb interaction between the two fragments ( see also fig .",

    ", we consider that the initial state corresponds to @xmath63 b , that is a situation just above the spontaneous fission threshold .",
    "this initial condition is similar to the one considered in ref .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that if the system is left initially with zero collective energy , the total final kinetic energy of fragments after td - edf evolution is compatible with experimental observation .",
    "to study possible non - adiabatic effect , initial conditions with boost of varying intensity ( including no boost at all ) are used .",
    "the quadrupole moment is selected as the most relevant collective dof . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass1 ] ) , the associated collective mass is then given by ( appendix [ sec : appendix ] ) @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are respectively the root - mean - square radius and quadrupole moment along the path .",
    "to get physical insight it is interesting to consider the situation where the system is already about to get separated into two fragments with a neck . assuming simply that the neck position is at the center of the whole system , quantities like mass , position , momentum , and intrinsic deformations of each fragment can be estimated through : @xmath67 }   & = & \\int x({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$ } } ) n({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$ } } ) \\theta(z ) d^3 { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$ } } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\langle x ( t ) \\rangle_{[2 ] }   & = & \\int x({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$ } } ) n({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$ } } ) \\left [ 1 - \\theta(z)\\right ] d^3 { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$ } } , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the local operator corresponding to the specific quantity under interest , @xmath69 is the heaviside step function and @xmath70 $ ] is a label of fragments . for a di - nuclear system ,",

    ", we also show the result obtained for a given @xmath38 assuming that the local density identifies with the corresponding density directly obtained from the constrained mean - field calculation . in the following ,",
    "the latter is referred to as `` static mass '' .",
    "we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_b14]-a that the mass is in general rather close to the static mass , especially if @xmath81 mev .",
    "in that case , the system first follows closely the adiabatic case and then some deviation is observed .",
    "the deviation occurs around the scission point . at this point",
    ", the slope of the pec suddenly change to match with the coulomb case that dominates at large distance .",
    "this increase of slope is expected to induce also a larger collective velocity and therefore also induce a possible departure from the adiabatic limit .",
    "we see in this figure that the mass also depends on the initial collective velocity imposed to the system .",
    "the larger is the initial velocity , the more deviation from the static mass is observed .",
    "it is however worth mentioning that the adiabatic / non - adiabatic behavior can not easily be concluded solely from the difference of mass as will be further illustrated below .",
    "as we have mentioned already , td - edf can not spontaneously lead to the separation of the system into two fragments below @xmath46 due to the improper treatment of level crossing .",
    "still it is possible to induce a fission by imposing some collective velocity initially . as already noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the collective energy that should be initially put in the system to observe fission is in general rather large .",
    "this aspect is further illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : eth ] where we investigated systematically the minimal collective energy necessary to induce fission for selected initial quadrupole deformation . to obtain this curve ,",

    "the collective energy are very high compared to the typical barrier height to fission .",
    "we would like to mention that this is clearly a pathology of td - edf at small initial deformation and beyond mean - field effects should clearly be included to obtain meaningful information from microscopic transport models around the fission barrier . still , to illustrate that the present method can apply in situation rather far from the adiabatic limit",
    ", we deduced the mass parameter for such initially highly excited systems .",
    "a few examples are shown in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_b14 ] . in that case ,",
    "important deviation are observed in the mass parameters compared to the static / adiabatic limit .",
    "since large collective velocities are imposed initially , such deviations are not surprising .",
    "however , the difference can also stem from the fact that the initial boost can induce a motion that is not described by the simple one - dimensional energy landscape shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pes ] . in particular ,",
    "preparing the system using constraint mean - field + boost is a rather arbitrary choice that will induce specific motion not only in the @xmath38 collective space but also in a larger space of collective variables like the monopole @xmath84 , hexadecapole @xmath85 , .... in particular , since the mass reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_b14 ] are compared for the same @xmath38 , differences observed between the static and dynamical masses stem from differences in the root mean - square radii that ultimately come from the differences in local densities .",
    "clear differences are observed between densities shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : denstime ] and densities of the adiabatic pec ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pes ] ) .",
    "the differences in local densities can of course come from non - adiabatic effects but also from a more complex path in a multi - dimensional potential energy landscape that could not be simply reduce to the 1d picture of fig .",
    "[ fig : pes ] .      as we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : mass ] , the present method allows us to access the set of conjugate momenta and the collective kinetic energy ( cke ) as well as the masses associated with the set of collective coordinates .",

    "we also compare these energies to the total kinetic energy computed through @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the single - particle current .",

    "the cke associated to @xmath85 is also initially non zero .",
    "this stems from the fact that @xmath38 and @xmath85 are not independent collective variables .",
