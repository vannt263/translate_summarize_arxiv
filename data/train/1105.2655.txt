    "many physical problems are governed by hyperbolic conservation laws with non vanishing stiff source terms .",
    "these problems can describe the effect of relaxation toward an equilibrium , as in the kinetic theory of gases for example . actually for monatomic gases ,",
    "when an equilibrium state is perturbed , it gradually relaxes to the equilibrium state with maxwellian velocity distribution .",
    "the time scale for such a relaxation process may not be short and the phenomenon of thermo - nonequilibrium becomes important . in this case , the compressible euler or navier - stokes equations can be applied . in the domain of kinetic equations ,",
    "the relaxation parameter is represented by the dimensionless knudsen number @xmath1 , defined as the ratio of the mean free path of the particles over a typical length scale , such as the size of the spatial domain . at the continuous level",
    ", it has been shown @xcite that , for the boltzmann equation @xmath4 when the knudsen number @xmath3 goes to zero , the distribution function @xmath5 converges to a local maxwellian @xmath6 , so the macroscopic model ( compressible euler or navier - stokes ) becomes more adequate to describe the behavior . for more details about fluid dynamic limits of kinetic equation",
    ", we refer to @xcite .    in this context",
    ", developing robust numerical schemes for kinetic equations that also work in the fluid regime becomes challenging .",
    "it has been done in the framework of _ asymptotic - preserving _ ( ap ) schemes @xcite . as it has already been defined in @xcite ,",
    "a numerical scheme is asymptotic preserving if    1 .",
    "it is a suitable scheme for the relaxation problem ( the kinetic equation ) , and when the mesh size and time step are fixed , whereas the parameter @xmath3 goes to zero , the scheme becomes a suitable discretization of the limit ( equilibrium ) problem ; 2 .",
    "implicit collision terms can be implemented explicitly .",
    "indeed , from a numerical point of view , the treatment of the stiffness can not be done with explicit schemes , so mathematicians will rather favor the use of semi - implicit of fully implicit schemes .",
    "one solution offered by e. gabetta , l. pareschi and g. toscani @xcite to design an asymptotic preserving scheme , was to penalize the nonlinear collision operator @xmath7 by a linear function @xmath8 and then absorb the linearly stiff part into the time variable to remove the stiffness .",
    "more recently , f. filbet & s. jin @xcite proposed to penalize the boltzmann s operator by the bgk operator in order to build stable schemes with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "if such schemes are now numerically validated and extensively used to discretize kinetic equations @xcite , their mathematical study has only been done in some particular cases @xcite , because of the complexity of general kinetic equations , where the collision operator is nonlinear . in this context ,",
    "hyperbolic conservation laws represent a simplified framework where a theoretical study of relaxation schemes can be done @xcite .",
    "indeed , there is a strong analogy between the local relaxation approximation of conservation laws , initially proposed in @xcite , and the study of fluid dynamical limits of kinetic equations @xcite . in the domain of hyperbolic conservation laws with stiff source terms",
    ", the relaxation parameter plays the role of the knudsen number in kinetic theory , while the source term is the analogous of the collision operator , which we want to be the most general possible .",
    "few works are devoted to the mathematical analysis of relaxation scheme for the approximation of conservations laws .",
    "we refer for instance to the series of paper by d. aregba - driollet and r. natalini @xcite and a. chalabi @xcite .",
    "but for all of them , the relaxation operator is relatively simple and can be easily treated explicitly without any additional computational cost .",
    "moreover , the goal of these works mainly consists to approximate the asymptotic limit of the relaxation model and not to develop a scheme which is accurate and efficient in various regimes .    here",
    "we want to focus on the approximation of general relaxation system with a nonlinear and stiff source term as in the context of the boltzmann kinetic equation , which is valid both for rarefied ( large values of @xmath3 ) and hydrodynamic ( @xmath9 ) regimes .",
    "therefore , we will consider throughout the rest of the paper the following hyperbolic relaxation system .",
