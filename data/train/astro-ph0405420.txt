    "astronomical observations have revealed the presence of large - scale magnetic fields in the universe .",
    "they exist in all types of galaxies ( spiral , elliptical , barred , and irregular ) , in galaxy clusters , and probably in superclusters , with correlation lengths @xmath0 mpc and intensities @xmath1 g .",
    "the presence of magnetic fields in all gravitationally bound large - scale structures could suggest that they have been created after structure formation through astrophysical mechanisms ( as , for example , the `` biermann battery '' ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the detection of magnetic fields in galaxies at high redshifts , could represent a strong hint that magnetic fields have been generated in the early universe ( _ i.e _ before structure formation ) by microphysics processes ( for a full discussion see grasso & rubinstein 2001 ; widrow 2003 ; dolgov 2001 ; giovannini 2004 ) .",
    "if large - scale magnetic fields have a primordial origin , they could have observable effects on the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) .",

    "_ 1997 ) , owing to differential faraday rotation across the last scattering surface .    clearly the measure of a non - zero faraday rotation in the cmbr polarization would be extremely important , since it would support the primordial origin of cosmic magnetic fields , and would provide direct information about the physics of the early universe .    in this paper , we analyze the faraday rotation of the cmbr polarization induced by a small ( @xmath2 ) primordial stochastic magnetic field .",
    "in particular , we calculate the angular dependence of the faraday rotation measure ( rm ) maps for different assumptions about the magnetic field spectral index and correlation length .",
    "we consider the possibility of helical primordial magnetic fields , showing that , contrary to the suggestion of ( pogosian _ et al .",

    "finally , we discuss the importance of the detector angular resolution in the faraday rotation measure , showing that it could severely constrain the actual possibility of observing the effect .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly review the properties of a stochastic homogeneous and isotropic magnetic field and we define its characteristic properties . in section 3 , we discuss the faraday rotation effects and show that faraday rm maps do not depend on the helical part of the magnetic field . in section 4 , we discuss the angular dependence of faraday rm maps for different assumptions on the magnetic field spectrum . finally , we summarize main results in section 5 .",
