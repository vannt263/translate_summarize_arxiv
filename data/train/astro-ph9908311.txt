    "sn  1978k was the second supernova detected and recognized as a supernova from its radio emission and the first from its x - ray flux ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) .",
    "it was discovered in a _ rosat _",
    "pspc observation of ngc  1313 but had not been detected by an _",
    "observation of the same field 11 years earlier .",
    "sn  1978k is one of a handful of extremely luminous , x - ray emitting supernovae @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations are difficult to obtain , so to date , few observations exist .",
    "currently , nine supernovae are known to emit , or have emitted , x - rays sometime in the months and years following their outbursts ( sn  1978k , sn  1979c , sn  1980k , sn  1986j , sn  1987a , sn  1988z , sn  1993j , sn  1994i , sn  1995n ( references are listed below ) . of these , the x - rays from sn  1987a largely resulted from compton scattered @xmath4-rays from the radioactive decay of @xmath5co .",
    "sn  1987a is very likely starting to undergo a circumstellar interaction @xcite ; it is expected to become a very bright x - ray source @xcite .",
    "the remaining eight supernovae are all believed to emit x - rays solely because of a circumstellar interaction .",
    "sn  1980k @xcite and sn  1993j @xcite were detected in the days immediately following their explosions .",
    "sn  1979c @xcite , sn  1988z @xcite , sn  1994i @xcite , and sn  1995n @xcite have all been recently detected so that we do not as yet have any x - ray light curves .",
    "just three supernovae remain : sn  1978k , sn  1986j , and sn  1993j . sn  1986j and sn  1993j have been reported to be fading @xcite ; the x - ray light curve of sn  1978k appeared to be constant ( * ? ? ?",
    "* spc96 ) as of 1995 .",
    "modeling of the radio spectrum by ( * ? ? ? * mwp ) led them to infer the existence of absorption by an hii  region along the line of sight to sn  1978k . based on an optical spectrum of sn  1978k taken in 1992  october , @xcite hypothesised that the optical and x - ray emission is driven by shock waves propagating through a clumpy circumnuclear wind , rather than through the extremely massive circumstellar envelope invoked in paper  i. in a recent paper , @xcite present a spectrum of the h@xmath6 + [ nii ] region at high resolution , which shows broad emission from the supernova ejecta , with superimposed ( narrow ) nebular lines .",
    "they attribute the latter to a circumstellar ejecta nebula from the progenitor of sn  1978k , which the supernova ejecta could plough into quite soon .",
    "this would cause significant brightening of sn  1978k at all wavelengths , making continued monitoring all the more important .    in this paper",
    ", we update the x - ray light curve with additional _ rosat _ hri observations that have been obtained since spc96 , briefly discuss the two epochs of _ asca _ data , update the optical and radio light curves , and present _ hst _ fos spectra . throughout this paper",
    ", we assume the distance to ngc 1313 is 4.5 mpc @xcite ; the corresponding image scale is 1  = 22 pc .",
    "for a multi - wavelength paper such as this one , we present the details of the observations and the analyses ( next section ) of the data for each bandpass in separate subsections in case the reader chooses to skip some of the details . each section is explicitly labeled for easier navigation .",
    "figure  [ obs_plot ] shows the distribution of all of the observations to be described .",
    "an early portion of the x - ray light curve of sn  1978k was presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* spc96 ) . since that paper",
    ", we have accumulated another six observations of the supernova which doubles the number of data points and increases the coverage to 7 years , representing about one third of the life of sn  1978k .",
    "table  [ obs_table ] summarizes the observations where we also include the pspc observations ( spc96 ) .",
    "the light curve therefore shows all of the data of sn1978k obtained by _ rosat_. the 1998 april observation is among the last observations to be obtained with _",
    "recently , @xcite analyzed the particle background of the _ rosat _ hri .",
    "the issues raised in that paper could affect the x - ray light curve of sn  1978k if the particle background has not been properly subtracted . in the light of that paper , the entire hri data set of sn",
    "1978k has been re - processed using the tools described in @xcite .",
    "we extracted the counts for each epoch using an aperture of radius @xmath7 which contains about 92% of the encircled energy @xcite .",
    "the counts from all of the observations were converted to a flux by adopting the best - fit model that describes the _ rosat _ pspc and _ asca _ sis data @xcite .",
    "the model combines a soft ( kt@xmath8  kev ) thermal component and either a hard ( kt@xmath9  kev ) thermal component or a power law ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "none of the hri points show evidence of a spectral change as measured by a hardness ratio ; the hri s ability to discern spectral changes is , however , quite limited , so the lack of a spectral change is not restrictive @xcite . the final light curve ( figure  [ hri_lc ] ) does not differ from the light curve presented in spc96 in any significant or systematic manner .      two observations of sn1978k have been obtained with the gas proportional counter ( gis ) and the ccd detectors ( sis ) on - board _ asca _ , in 1993 july ( during the verification phase ) and in 1995 november ( table  [ asca_table ] ) .",
    "the 1993 observation has been described in @xcite . in that paper",
    ", the authors did not detect any spectral lines .",
    "the 1995 observation has not been published elsewhere , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "we copied the screened event lists for both epochs of data from the _ asca _ archive .",
    "the use of the screened lists ensures that both data sets have been filtered identically .",
    "we extracted spectra from each data set taking care to avoid the other sources in ngc 1313 .",
    "the background was obtained from the same sis chip or gis field .",
    "spectra were extracted for each detector separately ( gis2 , gis3 ; sis0 , sis1 ) and then added together to form one gis and one sis spectrum per epoch .",
    "response matrices for each detector were also summed .",
    "the spectrum for 1995 november is shown in figure  [ asca_spec ] ; the model fits will be described in section  [ asca_analy ] .",
    "[ point_hist_fig ]    an observation using the faint object spectograph onboard the _ hubble space telescope _ was obtained in 1994 september 26 using the best available radio and optical coordinates .",
    "target lock failed , largely because the source is an emission line object .",
    "this accounts for the large number of off - source pointings .",
    "the observation was rescheduled for 1996 september 22 after improved offset coordinates were obtained from short wfpc2 exposures ( next section ) .",
    "some of the pointing problems stem from the difficulties in tying together the optical and radio coordinate systems in the southern hemisphere @xcite .",
    "the sn1978k observation was designed to obtain on - source `` blue '' ( @xmath11200 - 2500  using grating g160l ) and `` red '' ( @xmath12200 - 3200  using grating g270h ) spectra plus an off - source spectrum for each band .",
    "the approximate boundary between the two bands lies at @xmath12350  with an overlap of @xmath1100  .",
    "[ hst_spec_on ]    the pointing history , constructed from the `` ra_aper '' and `` decaper '' keywords in the file headers , is shown in figure  [ point_hist_fig ] where the weight of a data point represents the exposure time at that location .",
    "the total observation set is described in table  [ point_hist_tab ] . from the pointing history ,",
    "we distinguish 7 separate observations : a 1996 red band observation centered on sn1978k , 1996 blue and red band spectra nw of sn1978k , 1994 blue and red spectra nw of the sn , and 1994 blue and red spectra to the sw .",
    "we distinguish between the 1994 and 1996 observations at a given location because the source may vary .",
    "[ hst_spec_off ]    the `` on - source '' exposure time is therefore a function of one s definition of `` on - source . ''",
    "the `` true '' on - source observation is the red spectrum ; no observation in the blue was obtained at that location .",
    "the observations obtained nw of sn1978k lie @xmath11.3 from the supernova ; the observations obtained to the sw lie @xmath12.3 away .",
    "these distances are approximately 4.3 and 7.6 times the size of the fos aperture or approximately 6.5 and 11.5 times the 70% encircled energy radii of the costar - corrected _ hst _ optics .",
    "the data were calibrated using the standard fos pipeline .",
    "we checked the wavelength calibration at the end points of the spectra and verified the flux calibration using fos tasks in stsdas .",
    "we carefully examined each spectrum for evidence of noisy or dead pixels . the red spectrum centered on the sn",
    "had a noisy pixel in the middle of the band ; we clipped out the affected pixels .",
    "none of the candidate lines correspond to noisy pixels as listed in the august 1994 noisy pixel list @xcite .",
    "all of the candidate lines were visible in the raw and calibrated data .",
    "we then co - added the data for a given pointing and epoch .",
    "the spectra are shown in figures  [ hst_spec_on ] and  [ hst_spec_off ] .",
    "all line fluxes were corrected for reddening using two different values .",
    "the first value of @xmath11 , comes from @xcite while the second value , @xmath12 , comes from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) .",
    "these values were converted to a@xmath13 using the reddening curve in @xcite .",
    "the first value increases line fluxes by a factor of @xmath14 at @xmath15 @xmath12800 while the second increases the fluxes by a factor of @xmath16 .",
    "the second value would seem more likely , given the environment immediately after a supernova explosion .",
    "however , the optical spectrum ( to be presented shortly ) implies that the extinction has decreased to approximately zero .",
    "the optical light curve originates from two sources : ground - based optical photometry and wfpc2 snapshots using _",
    "hst_.    to obtain accurate coordinates and offset stars for sn  1978k in the _ hst _ reference frame , @xmath17 and @xmath18 band wfpc2 snapshots of the sn  1978k region were obtained .",
    "the observations occurred on 1996 january 3 with exposure times of 60  sec for both the f555w ( @xmath19 ) filter and the f439w ( @xmath20 ) filter .",
    "we extracted the counts for sn  1978k as well as the counts for stars ` b ' ( @xmath21 e of sn  1978k ) , ` c ' ( @xmath22 w ) , and ` d ' ( @xmath23 nw ) ( q.v . , paper  i for a finding chart ) using apertures @xmath24 in diameter .",
    "we adjusted the resulting magnitudes for the gain , charge transfer efficiency , contamination corrections , and added the zero offset to place the magnitudes relative to vega .",
    "these corrections are all described in the @xcite_hst _ data handbook ( version 2.0 ) . for the @xmath18 band , the magnitudes of stars b , c , and d differed from their published values ( paper  i ) by a mean value of + 0.759 ; for the @xmath17 band , the mean value was + 1.396 . correcting the sn  1978k magnitudes by these offsets gave the @xmath17 and @xmath18 magnitudes for sn  1978k : 20.67@xmath250.11 and 19.81@xmath250.05 , respectively .",
    "the supernova has also been monitored intermittently on our behalf by various observers .",
    "the resulting magnitudes , determined from differential photometry relative to the sequence established in paper  i , are collated in table  [ optmags ] and shown in figure  [ optlc ] .",
    "the data are not conclusive ; an increase in brightness of @xmath26  mag in all filters is suggested , but the possibility that there has been no change in brightness of sn  1978k between 1990 and 1996 can not be ruled out .      [ optspec ]    spectrophotometry of sn  1978k in the wavelength range @xmath27  was obtained on 1996  oct  8 ut with the 3.9  m anglo - australian telescope .",
    "the rgo spectrograph was used with the 25  cm camera , a 300  lines  mm@xmath28 grating , a slit length of 77  , and a tektronix 1k ccd .",
    "three consecutive exposures of 1000  sec each were obtained on the supernova , followed by a short exposure on the flux standard eg21 @xcite .",
    "the three exposures were reduced individually within iraf , and then the line fluxes were measured separately for each spectrum to permit the flux errors to be calculated . the final resolution obtained after light smoothing is 12   .",
    "the result of co - adding all 3  spectra is shown in figure  [ optspec ] , and the line fluxes ( relative to h@xmath29 and uncorrected for reddening ) and proposed identifications are listed in table  [ aatlines ] .",
    "[ rlc ]    sn  1978k has been monitored at irregular intervals using the 6  antennas of the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) since its discovery .",
    "using the multi - frequency agility of the atca , observations with a 128  mhz bandwidth are taken over an 4 - 12  hour period , with rapid switching between simultaneous measurements at 1380 and 2370  mhz , or at 4790 and 8640  mhz . beginning in august  1998 , the central frequency of the s - band observations",
    "was changed to 2496  mhz in an effort to avoid encroaching interference .",
    "the observations were made with sn  1978k displaced slightly from the phase - tracking center to avoid the most common system - related artefacts .",
    "the continuum data over all 15 baselines was examined interactively using aips to remove interference , then calibrated using repeated measurements of the secondary flux calibrator , pks b0252 - 712 .",
    "the flux scale was set by using observations of pks b1934 - 638 , and the revised calibration of @xcite .",
    "[ rlcmod ]    deconvolved images of sn  1978k show the source still to be unresolved at all frequencies . since sn  1978k is the only significant source of continuum emission in the field ( fig .  5 of paper  i )",
    ", it was decided to measure the fluxes directly from plots of the calibrated visibility amplitudes , binned into @xmath30 time periods , to give a truer reflection of the errors , which are dominated more by atmospheric conditions than by the model fitting to the deconvolved images .",
    "the results from eight epochs are compiled in table  [ atcafluxes ] , together with three observations at 0.843 ghz using the molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) . the post-1990 radio light curve , including data from paper i and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mwp ) , is presented in figure  [ rlc ] .",
    "spc96 presented the first x - ray light curve for sn1978k and showed that the light curve was consistent with zero slope .",
    "the updated x - ray light curve ( figure  [ hri_lc ] ) should decay as t@xmath31 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the formal fitted value of the exponent to all of the data ( flux versus days past maximum ) is @xmath32 ( 90% confidence range ) if all of the data points are included in the fit .",
    "this fit is illustrated in the figure as the solid line .",
    "the dashed lines show the @xmath2590% range of the slope . note that the range is consistent with zero . as a check ,",
    "we fit only the hri data points , obtaining a value for @xmath33 .",
    "this slope also includes zero and covers approximately the same range .",
    "additional observations must be obtained to ascertain whether sn  1978k has started its slide into obscurity or if the last data point is a fluctuation .",
    "given the scatter of the other data points , a fluctuation provides the most likely explanation .",
    "fluctuations in the x - ray light curve with amplitudes of @xmath120% are expected if the ejecta are inhomogeneous ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "* flc96 ) discussed several regimes for the decay of x - rays from sn  1993j .",
    "those regimes were ( i ) the optically thick shock case ; ( ii ) the adiabatic case ; and ( iii ) the radiative case .",
    "the time behavior from each differed . for the optically thick case , @xmath34 where @xmath35temperature , @xmath36time , @xmath37power law index for the density profile of the ejecta , and @xmath38power law index for the density profile of the circumstellar matter .",
    "the power law is an approximation to the supernova density profile ; typical values from models lie between 7 and 12 .",
    "the cf94 model requires @xmath39 for an adiabatic shock ; for @xmath40 , radiative cooling becomes important .",
    "a steady stellar wind will create a circumstellar medium with @xmath41 , so that value is usually adopted . but flc96 showed that @xmath42 described the sn  1993j x - ray behavior more accurately .    for the adiabatic case , @xmath43/(n - s)}$ ] , while for the radiative case , @xmath44 .",
    "if we assume the slope is precisely zero , then we can explore the possible values for @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "a value of @xmath41 is usually adopted because it describes the circumstellar density distribution from a steady wind .",
    "a value of @xmath47 for @xmath46 is supported by the sn  1993j data ( flc96 ) , however , subsequent analysis shows @xmath41 is correct @xcite . while @xmath41 has physical significance , we will also explore the effect of @xmath48 .",
    "for the optically thick case , either low @xmath45 ( @xmath49 ) or @xmath48 plus any @xmath45 yields a solution .",
    "for the adiabatic case , if @xmath41 , @xmath45 must again be low ( @xmath49 ) , while @xmath48 leads to no solution .",
    "for the radiative case , if @xmath41 leads to no solution , while if @xmath48 , then @xmath50 .",
    "using just the light curve , we are unable to obtain sufficient information to establish the emission behavior uniquely because either the optically thick shock or the radiative cases fit the data equally well .",
    "we only establish a range for @xmath45 ( @xmath14 - 12 ) .",
    "further , these two models use @xmath41 and @xmath48 . by comparison ,",
    "hydrodynamic models establish a power - law distribution with @xmath51 within a day or two of the explosion @xcite .",
    "only additional observations across a wider time span will yield sufficient information to break the degeneracy and allow the model to be directly tested .",
    "each epoch s spectrum was fit using simple , absorbed models ( bremsstrahlung , power law , and emission from a hot , diffuse gas ) ( table  [ asca_fits ] ) . within the errors ,",
    "the model fits were identical for the two epochs regardless of the model .",
    "figure  [ asca_spec](a ) shows the 1995 november spectrum and figure  [ asca_spec](b ) shows the fitted contours both for the hot gas model .",
    "we present the spectral fit using the model with a thawed abundance to show the range of the parameters and the degeneracy of the model . the fitted 1993 spectrum in @xcite fixed the abundance at 1.0 ;",
    "when we use the same fixed abundance for the 1995 spectrum , we obtain the same fitted temperature as did petre et al . the corresponding figure for",
    "the first epoch appears nearly identical @xcite .",
    "no one model provided a significantly better fit than the others .",
    "we integrated the model spectra across several bands ( 0.5 - 2.0 , 2.0 - 3.0 , 3.0 - 4.0 , 4.0 - 5.0 , and 5.0 - 9.0 kev ) to obtain fluxes in each band for each epoch .",
    "the fluxes are also consistent with each other within the errors .",
    "no lines were detected in either epoch .",
    "the unabsorbed 0.5 - 2.0 kev flux is @xmath11.3@xmath5210@xmath53 ergs s@xmath28 @xmath54 which corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath13@xmath5210@xmath55 ergs s@xmath28 .",
    "this flux lies within 10 - 20% of the mean flux obtained with _",
    "rosat _ , depending upon the adopted model for the x - ray spectra .",
    "the luminosities of the _ asca _ ( 1 - 10 kev ) and _ rosat _ ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) bands provide an estimate of the shock temperature ( * ? ? ? * flc96 ) via @xmath56 our luminosities yield t@xmath57 @xmath16@xmath5810@xmath59 k. this is the temperature of the reverse shock where soft x - rays are expected to be produced @xcite .",
    "as expected for a nebular object , we do not see a continuum in the _ hst _ spectra .",
    "the pointing history makes the uv spectra ( figures  [ hst_spec_on ] and [ hst_spec_off ] ) difficult to interpret . at the distance of ngc 1313 , 1  is @xmath122",
    "pc , so we are sampling relatively widely - spaced regions with the fos spectra .",
    "the mgii 2800  line is a good starting point because the line is the easiest to interpret .",
    "it is visible in the on - source spectrum and not to the nw .",
    "this is a clear detection of sn1978k .",
    "the mgii @xmath12800  is a doublet with components at 2795 and 2803  .",
    "we fit the lines with double gaussians and constrained the fwhm to be identical for the two components .",
    "the results of the fits are shown in table  [ fos_lines ] .",
    "the fitted fwhm corresponds to the instrumental resolution , so the lines are unresolved .",
    "we derive velocities for the gas of 632 and 640  km  s@xmath28 , respectively . with errors on the line centers from the gaussian fits of order 10 - 15 km s@xmath28 , the two line velocities are identical .",
    "the redshift for sn  1978k , taking into account the rotation velocity of ngc  1313 at the position of the supernova , is 439  km  s@xmath28 ( paper  i ) ; the lines have intrinsic velocities of @xmath60  km  s@xmath28 .",
    "the ly@xmath0 and [ ne  iv ] lines are detected in the nw and sw pointings .",
    "we need not discuss ly@xmath0 because it is emitted by nearly every source in the sky . the [ ne  iv ] line is not observed in the on - source pointing .",
    "it must arise from a location farther from sn1978k than the projected aperture size .",
    "the fos aperture is @xmath10.15 in radius , which corresponds to @xmath13.3 pc at ngc 1313 .",
    "the nw and sw pointings lie at projected spatial distances of @xmath128 and @xmath150 pc from sn1978k . while the gas velocities of the [ ne  iv ] lines are larger , by a factor of two , than the velocities measured from the optical and mg ii ( uv ) emission lines , the projected distances are far larger than the distance any ejecta of sn1978k could cover in the @xmath120 years since its detonation .",
    "this is particularly critical given that the supernova is supposed to be evolving in a dense circumstellar medium which means that the ejecta are rapidly decelerated ( e.g. , @xcite ) . if we assume that the x - ray flux has illuminated the surrounding volume for the entire lifetime of sn1978k , the volume s radius is @xmath120 light years or @xmath16 pc .",
    "the [ ne  iv ] is produced outside of this volume and must either be located in the pre - shock medium or is unrelated to sn1978k .",
    "if the [ ne  iv ] matter moved at its measured velocity , it would cover the @xmath130 - 50 pc in @xmath142 - 70 kyr which is entirely consistent with durations of mass loss phases in massive stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the uv line fluxes to the nw , the only position for which we have spectra at both observation epochs , are constant within the errors across the two - year gap .",
    "this is expected if these lines originate outside of the shocked material .",
    "we also include in table  [ fos_ul ] upper limits on ultraviolet lines that are typically found in other snr and h ii regions and have been predicted by models ( e.g. , @xcite ) these upper limits were estimated by fitting a gaussian to noise spikes at the location of the expected emission line and were dereddened using the adopted two values above .",
    "the optical light curve ( figure  [ optlc ] ) shows the predicted behavior of the interaction model of @xcite assuming an explosion date near 1978 june 1 .",
    "if the slight rise in the optical magnitudes continues , it will increasingly be at odds with the prediction ( i.e. , decline ) of this model .",
    "the increase can not be attributed to a simple increase in emitting area because the necessary expansion velocity , @xmath12000 km s@xmath28 is not supported by the observations .",
    "figure  [ optlc ] also shows the predicted -11/7 ( leading shock ) and -8/7 ( material behind shock ) decays from @xcite ( their equations 5 and 6 ) .",
    "the two curves have been arbitrarily normalized to magnitude 16 at 230 days ( 1 e - fold time ) .",
    "the arbitrary normalization was chosen to show that the -8/7 curve decays too quickly .",
    "if the increase in brightness continues , both curves increasingly fail .",
    "the optical spectrum is presented in figure  [ optspec ] . the most significant change since the 1990 and 1992 spectra presented in paper",
    "i is that the balmer line ratios indicate that the line of sight extinction towards sn  1978k has dropped from @xmath61  mag to virtually zero . despite using a wide slit in moderate seeing ( @xmath62 ) ,",
    "it is possible that differential refraction could cause us to lose more of the red light than the blue ( the slit was oriented n - s and not at the parallactic angle ) . indeed , with a drop in the extinction of 2  magnitudes , we might have expected sn  1978k to have brightened optically in that time , but the optical photometry ( table  [ optmags ] ) suggests little or no increase in brightness .",
    "we conclude that radiative transfer effects have altered the decrement .",
    "table  [ balm_decr ] lists the balmer line strengths for the 1990 , 1992 @xcite , and 1996 observations , along with values for case a and case b recombination assuming t = 5000 k ( case a ) and t = 10@xmath63 k and n@xmath64 = 10@xmath59 @xmath3 ( case b ) @xcite . for case a at t = 10@xmath65 k ,",

    "this matches very well with a nearby , compact h ii region just visible in the plate in @xcite .",
    "the [ oiii ] lines provide an estimate of the temperature ( [ i(4959)+i(5007)]/i(4363 ) ) of @xmath11 - 1.5@xmath5210@xmath63 k @xcite for n@xmath64 @xmath110@xmath59 @xmath3 if we assume all of the 4363 emission is [ o  iii ] .",
    "the estimated temperature changes very little if n@xmath64 varies from 10@xmath67 to 10@xmath68 @xmath3 .",

    "neither the clump model nor the shell model provide a good description of the observed line emission .",
