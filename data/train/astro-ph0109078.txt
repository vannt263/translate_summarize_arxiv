    "the frequency dependence of the discrepancy reveals that there is a problem with the model , and that the problem lies very near the surface .",
    "balmforth ( 1992a , 1992b , 1992c ) uses the non - local mixing - length theory to model the turbulent convection , and includes the turbulent pressure , but ignores the turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent entropy in modeling the sun",

    "has proposed a semi - analytical model of the turbulent convection .",
    "the main idea is to include a full turbulent spectrum in the model of convection .",
    "applications to stellar models have been discussed by canuto &  mazzitelli ( 1991,1992 ) and canuto , goldman , & mazzitelli ( 1996 ) .",
    "the parameters of the canuto - mazzitelli ( c&m ) approach are derived from the laboratory experiments of the incompressible convection , and extrapolated to the stellar conditions .",
    "using this approach , the superadiabatic peak is much higher than that of the standard solar models , while the computed frequencies of solar p - modes are closer to the observed values than those from the standard solar models .",
    "turbulence is a highly nonlinear phenomenon .",
    "numerical experiments are a direct , effective way to investigate turbulence , in addition to the laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "chan &  sofia ( 1989 ) performed a three - dimensional numerical simulation of the deep compressible convection , where the superadiabatic excess in the temperature gradient is very small .",

    "they derived expressions for key physical parameters such as the convective energy flux .",
    "these , in principle , can be conveniently applied to stellar models .",
    "the chan - sofia formula for the convective flux was incorporated into the yale stellar evolution code by lydon ( 1993 ) and lydon , fox , &  sofia ( 1992 ) .",
    "the diffusion approximation was used to treat radiative transfer , and the radiative atmosphere was treated by lydon et al .",
    "( 1992 ) as in the standard mlt yale models ( e.g. , guenther et al .",
    "they found that the peak of the superadiabatic layer ( sal ) is not as high as in the c&m model and is located at a greater depth below the surface .",
    "however , their models yielded a larger discrepancy between the observed solar p - mode frequencies and those computed from standard solar models .",
    "part of the discrepancy could be attributed to the fact that these models did not match the solar radius very precisely .",
    "but this is expected since the simulation , which is valid for the deeper adiabatic regions , is extrapolated into the sal , where the temperature gradient greatly exceeds the adiabatic gradient , and some inaccuracy is inevitable .    in order to overcome these difficulties , kim ( 1993 ) and kim et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996 ) conducted a three - dimensional numerical simulation whose domain includes shallower layers .",
    "this simulation treats the coupling of radiation and convection and includes realistic equation of state and radiative opacities , taken from the yale stellar evolution code .",
    "the kim et al.s ( 1995 , 1996 ) simulation treats radiative transfer in the diffusion approximation , which is only valid in an optically thick medium , and consequently can not be used in the solar atmosphere .",
    "thus the top boundary of the simulation was set below the sal peak .",
    "the kim et al.s ( 1996 ) models were parameterized as a varying mixing length with depth by demarque , guenther , & kim ( 1997 ) , in precisely calibrated solar models .",
    "the p - mode frequencies of the models were found to agree more closely with the observed solar p - mode frequencies , than the standard solar model frequencies , but these models exhibit , like the c&m models , a higher sal peak than the standard solar models .",
    "more recently , kim &  chan ( 1998 ) have completed a three - dimensional radiative hydrodynamic simulation of the complete extent of the sal including the solar atmosphere ( about 2 pressure scale heights above and 2.5 pressure scale heights below the sal ) .",
    "the numerical approach was described by kim &  chan ( 1997 ) .",
    "the simulation of kim &  chan is fully compressible and uses the realistic equation of state and opacities .",
    "the radiation has been treated by utilizing the three - dimensional eddington approximation , which is valid in both the optically thin regions near the surface and the optically thick regions in the interior .",
    "demarque , guenther , &   kim ( 1999 ) mimicked this simulation in the calibrated solar models by increasing the opacity coefficient @xmath0 near the surface .",
    "such models are called perturbed-@xmath0 models .",
    "the discrepancy between calculated and observed p - mode frequencies decreases when compared to standard solar models . a deeper layer ( about 5 pressure scale heights above and 6 pressure scale heights below the sal ) was simulated by stein &  nordlund ( 1998 ) using different numerical methods for the convective and radiative components . instead of parameterizing the simulation , rosenthal et al .",
    "( 1999 ) matched the simulation to an envelope which was constructed using an mlt envelope code .",
    "the computed frequencies are in better agreement with the observed solar p - mode frequencies when compared to the standard solar models .",

    "( 1997 ) have also discussed the same transition layer .",
    "one way to include turbulence in stellar models is to use the numerical simulations to directly calculate the convective temperature gradient and its derivatives needed in stellar model calculations . however , because turbulence is chaotic , nonlocal , and three - dimensional , and because it involves nonlinear interactions over many disparate length scales , the simulation for the whole convective zone is too computationally expensive for stellar model calculations . besides , the accuracy of the simulation , if performed , is too low to match the required accuracy for the stellar model calculations .",
    "fortunately , the existing simulations show that the mlt prediction deviates from simulations only in the sal part of the convection zone .",
    "even so , it is still impractical to calculate the convective temperature gradient and its derivatives , from numerical simulation of the sal in the stellar evolution model caculations .",
    "robinson et al . ( 2000 ) have performed some hydrodynamical simulatons ( the viscosity parameter @xmath1 , see below ) of the sal at three stages in the solar evolution : the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) , the present sun and the subgiant .",
    "the results show that the turbulent velocities in the sal , as functions of gas pressure , change little for all these stages . therefore , it is feasible to compute the effects of turbulence on the convective gradients",
    ". overshooting was observed in both the solar subatmosphere and 3d numerical simulations , and the @xmath0-models @xcite demonstrate that overshooting is likely to be one of the keys to match the real sun .",
    "it is a challenge to include overshooting within the framework of the local mlt since overshooting is a nonlocal phenomenon .    in this paper",
    ", we use the results of the 3d numerical simulations of turbulence to calculate the convective temperature gradient , and its derivatives needed in solar model calculations . as",
    "mlt is valid in most of the convective zone , it is convenient to include turbulence within the framework of mlt . in  [ s2 ] we summarize the new results ( @xmath2 ) of the 3d simulations of the solar sal , at 3 stages of its evolution .",

    "we describe the calibrated solar models with turbulence in  [ s4 ] . in  [ s5 ] the influence of turbulence on the structure variables , the adiabatic sound speed , the structure of the highly superadiabatic layer , and the p - mode frequencies are calculated and compared to the observed solar p - mode frequencies .",
    "concluding remarks are presented in the last section .",
    "we incorporate the radiative hydrodynamical simulations of the outer layers of the sun into the 1d stellar models .",
    "three 3d simulations have been performed using the hydrostatic 1d stellar models , at three stages of its evolution ( zams , present sun and subgiant ) , as starting points .",
    "the physics ( thermodynamics , the equation of state , and opacities ) in the simulation is the same as in the 1d stellar models .",
    "these simulations follow closely the approach described by kim & chan ( 1998 ) , and are described in more detail by robinson et al .",
    "the full hydrodynamical equations were solved in a thin subsection of the stellar model , i.e. a 3d box located in the vicinity of the photosphere . for the radiative transport , the diffusion approximation was used in the deep region ( @xmath3 ) of the simulation , while the 3d eddington approximation was used ( unno & spiegel 1966 ) in the region above .",
    "after the simulation had reached a steady state , statistical integrations were performed for each simulation for over 2500 seconds in the case of the solar surface convection .",

    "this consideration disfavors those solar models with a higher sal peak than that of the ssm .",
    "= 6.5 cm    it should be pointed out that we compare different solar models at the same radius coordinate while we compare the sal at the same pressure coordinate .",
    "therefore , we observe a large difference for the convective velocity in figs .",
    "[ dkvhc ] but a small ( or no ) difference between the esm ( psm ) and the ssm in fig .",
    "[ conv ] .",
    "our principal goal is to investigate how the treatment of turbulence in solar modeling affects the computed model structure .",
    "therefore , we do not include the contribution of turbulence to the pulsation equations when we calculate p - mode oscillation frequency differences caused by turbulence .",
    "we use guenther s pulsation code ( 1994 ) to calculate the p - mode frequencies under the adiabatic approximation , for our ssm , psm , esm1 and esm2 , respectively .",
    "[ turbdif ] shows the frequency differences ( turbulent solar model , including the psm , esm1 and esm2 , minus standard solar model ) scaled by the mode mass @xmath146 ( e.g. , christensen - dalsgaard et al .",
    "the frequency differences between the psm and ssm are comparable with balmforth s ( table 1 , 1992a ) .",
    "both models use turbulent pressure alone .",
    "the frequency differencies between the ems and ssm are comparable with rosenthal et al.s ( figure 5 , 1999 ) .    in order to examine if the frequency differences shown in fig .  [ turbdif ] are caused by the calibration of the solar models , we calculated the corresponding uncalibrated models for the calibrated psm and esm2 , respectively . unlike the calibrated model , the starting model for the uncalibrated model is the standard solar model at the present age of the sun , instead of the zams model .",
    "we switch on the turbulence and evolve the model 10 timesteps with 1 year as the timestep length .",
    "the frequency differences between calibrated and uncalibrated turbulent models are less than 1 @xmath147hz .",
    "= 6.5 cm    by calculating the frequency differences between the esm1 and esm2 models we can find out the effect of temporal change of turbulence in the evolutionary timescale of the sun . from fig .",
    "[ turbdif ] we can see that this effect is very small ( less than 0.5 @xmath147hz ) .",
    "= 6.5 cm    as pointed out ealier , the psm model is obtained by including turbulent pressure alone in the solar modeling , while the esms are obtained by introducing the turbulent variables @xmath11 and @xmath15 to include both turbulent pressure and kinetic energy .",
    "therefore , the frequency differences between these two kinds of models reflects the different treatments of turbulence in the solar modeling .",
    "physically , the differences are caused by the addition of turbulent kinetic energy .",
    "[ turbdif ] shows that the frequency differences caused by turbulent kinetic energy are much larger than those caused by turbulent pressure alone in size .",
    "[ pmode ] shows that the frequency changes caused by turbulent kinetic energy make the computed model frequencies match the solar data better than the ssm model , which is in agreement with rosenthal et al.s result ( see their figures  1 and 6 , 1999 ) .",
    "we have shown how different treatments of turbulence in solar modeling affect the model structure within the framework of the standard mixing length theory .",
    "the turbulent velocity is obtained from 3d numerical simulations of turbulence in the highly superadiabatic layer of the sun .",
    "when we introduce the turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass @xmath11 and the effective ratio of specific heats due to the turbulent perturbation @xmath15 , as independent thermodynamic variables , the resultant solar model is in agreement with the patched solar model , in which the simulated sal replaces the original sal .",
    "the frequency shift tends to match the observations better than the standard solar model .",
    "in contrast , when we use only the turbulent pressure , the turbulent effects are substantially underestimated ( in the sense that the resultant p - mode frequency shift is much smaller ) .",
    "another difference between method 1 and 2 is that the sal peak in the esm is lower than that of the ssm , but that of the psm is the same as that of the ssm .",
    "the reason is that the increase of the mixing length , in the vicinity of the sal peak , by the turbulent kinetic energy , is more than double the reduction of the mixing length by the turbulent pressure ( see panel 4 of fig .",
    "[ dkvhc ] ) .",
    "the sal produced by method 2 is consistent with that of our 3d simulations , while method 1 does not change the sal structure of the ssm .",
    "previously , the turbulent pressure was considered to play an important role in solar modeling , but we have shown that this is not true : it is the turbulent kinetic energy that is important .",
    "in fact , if we calibrate the solar model , the elevation caused by the turbulent pressure @xmath148 vashishes . consequently , @xmath149 vanishes , where @xmath150 is the adiabatic sound speed at the solar surface ( photosphere ) .",
    "however , we obtain almost the same frequency changes with and without calibrating the model radius to the solar radius at the present age of the sun .",
    "moreover , the solar model with the turbulent pressure alone does not reproduce the p - model frequency shift obtained by rosenthal et al.s patched model ( 1999 ) .",
    "to match the observed solar p - mode frequencies is not the only motivation to improve the solar model by including turbulence .",
    "more interesting is to generate a solar model that can excite the observed p - modes and damp the unobserved modes simultaneously .",
    "such an effort is in progress @xcite .",
    "overshooting may also play an important role in this regard .",
