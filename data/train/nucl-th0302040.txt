    "the lowest order in the interaction mean - field treatments of the nuclear pairing in bulk nuclear matter and in finite nuclei are conceptually simple and have been reasonably consistent with the phenomenology of these systems .",
    "the hartree - fock - bogolyubov ( hfb ) theory with zero- or finite - range ( e.g. , the skyrme and the gogny ) phenomenological forces has been the standard tool in the studies of the nuclear structure to describe the bulk of the experimental data @xcite . at the same time , the calculations of the pairing gaps in bulk nuclear matter based on the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory with interactions modeled by the bare ( realistic ) nucleon - nucleon forces and quasiparticle spectra in the effective mass approximation are not inconsistent with the cooling simulations of neutron stars or the phenomenology of their rotation dynamics .",
    "although there is no direct evidence for higher order correlations in the phenomenology of nuclear systems , these can not be discarded on the basis of purely phenomenological arguments .",
    "the effective forces used in the hfb calculations are fitted to the pairing properties of ( some ) nuclei , consequently the contributions beyond mean field are built - in automatically ( e.g. , the effective skyrme or gogny forces include the contributions from the ladder diagrams ) .",
    "the values of the pairing gaps deduced from the phenomenology of neutron stars depend sensitively on the physical input , such as the equation of state , the matter composition , and its dynamical properties .",
    "provided the uncertainties in these ingredients the phenomenological values of the gap can be off by an order of magnitude . from the theory point of view",
    "the higher order correlations might not be manifest due to large cancellation between the vertex and propagator renormalization .",
    "the on - mass - shell properties of the pairing gaps are well understood at the mean - field level . upon ignoring the renormalization effects ,",
    "the on - mass - shell gaps can be directly computed from the nucleon - nucleon scattering phase shifts .",
    "since the pairing is a low - temperature phenomenon , a well - defined fermi sea implies that the on - shell self - energies of weakly excited quasiparticles can be expanded around their fermi momentum .",
    "the magnitude of the gap is then controlled by the renormalization of density of states at the fermi surface .",
    "since the ratio of the momentum - dependent effective mass to the bare mass is less than unity the reduction of the density of states causes a reduction of the pairing gap .    the early work to construct renormalization schemes for strongly interacting fermions introduced wave - function renormalization factors in the kernel of the gap equation and modeled the pairing interaction in terms of particle - hole irreducible vertices @xcite . these were related to the phenomenological landau fermi liquid parameters which can ( in principle ) be fixed by comparison with experiments .",
    "the landau parameters can be obtained from _ ab initio _ microscopic calculations as well , which are needed , for example , to describe isospin asymmetric nuclear systems that are not directly accessible in laboratories @xcite .",
    "various aspects of the pairing in the infinite nuclear matter beyond the mean - field ( bcs ) approximation were addressed during the past two decades by employing either more advanced schemes to calculated the self - energy and vertex corrections and/or modern ( phase - shift equivalent ) interactions .",
    "this work includes the microscopic calculations of the effective interactions and landau parameters using variants of the babu - brown @xcite or related ( e.g. , polarization potential ) schemes of summing the polarization graphs in neutron matter @xcite .",
    "the polarization effects were found to suppress the on - shell pairing gaps by large factors .",
    "earlier , similar reduction was found from the correlated basis variational calculations based on the jastrow ansatz for fermionic wave functions @xcite .",
    "more recent work concentrated on the calculations of the wave - function renormalizations and their implementations in gap equations employing self - energies derived within brueckner theory at first @xcite and second @xcite order in the hole - line expansion .",
    "while again a suppression was found due to the wave function renormalizations , supplementing these self - energy corrections with appropriate vertex corrections largely compensates for the latter effect @xcite .",
    "the finite temperature @xmath0 matrix was utilized to deduce the pairing correlations that include full spectral information on the system by using the thouless criterion @xcite , wave - function renormalizations in the gap equations , or the @xmath0 matrix in the superfluid phase @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the critical temperature of superfluid phase transition found in these approaches is due to dressing of propagators in the particle - particle channel , i.e. , the analog effect of the self - energy renormalizations in the brueckner scheme @xcite .",
    "( it is unrelated to the reduction mentioned above caused by the polarization of the interaction that follows from the resummations in the particle - hole channels . )",
    "renormalization group approach has been used to resume the particle - hole channels and deduce the pairing gap from the matrix elements defined on the fermi surface @xcite ; the overall magnitude of the reduction of the gap is consistent with the results mentioned above .",
    "the pairing gaps computed from the renormalization group motivated interactions are in good agreement with the calculations based on the original bare interactions @xcite or the effective gogny interactions @xcite below the renormalization scale .",
    "the off - mass - shell physics of the nuclear pairing is much less understood .",
    "contributions to the ( complex ) pairing gap can be generated by time nonlocal interactions .",
    "the simplest example is the fermionic fock - exchange diagram in a boson - exchange interaction model .",
    "the generic theory of the boson - exchange superconductors is known in the form first developed by eliashberg @xcite to describe the superconductivity in materials where the electron - phonon coupling is of the order of unity ( see also the general references @xcite ) . because the theory contains another small parameter -",
    "the ratio of the phonon debye energy to the fermi energy of electrons - the vertex corrections ( according to the migdal theorem ) can be neglected .",
    "for the same reason , the quasiclassical approximation can be used where the on - shell energy of the original green s functions are integrated out . in our context the coupling of the pionic modes to baryons is not small and the characteristic energies of the off - shell excitations are not small compared to the fermi energy .",
    "below , we shall partially overcome these difficulties , first , by including a vertex renormalization by the short - range correlations in the pion - nucleon vertex and , second , by applying an improved version of the quasiclassical approximation .    pairing in nuclear systems , induced by retarded interactions ,",

    "the retarded pairing interaction is driven by an exchange of virtual phonons - low - lying collective bosonic excitation @xcite . in the astrophysical context of neutron star",
    "crusts the attractive pairing interaction is mediated by an exchange of _ real _ phonons of the nuclear coulomb lattice of the crusts @xcite .",
    "the approach taken here differs from the models above in the nature of the bosonic modes that mediate the pairing interactions .",
    "while the density fluctuations are responsible for the pairing interaction in the models above , we concentrate here at the modes that have the quantum numbers of pions .    in what follows , we construct a model of pairing in neutron matter that is based on the meson - exchange picture of the nuclear interactions .",
    "specific to our model is the explicit treatment of the mesonic degrees of freedom including retardation . unlike the potential models ,",
    "the interaction incorporates medium modifications of the dispersion relation of the mesons ( pions ) and they are treated dynamically , i.e. , only in the static limit the retarded interaction reduces to a meson ( pion)-exchange potential .",
    "we note that the meson - exchange picture of pairing is known from applications of the walecka mean - field model to the pairing problem @xcite .",
    "these approaches , however , do not include the pion dynamics or retardation .",
    "in computing the renormalization of the pionic propagator and the pion - nucleon vertex , we shall use a simplified version of the resummation of the particle - hole diagrams by modeling the residual interaction in terms of a contact approximation to the @xmath1 landau parameter .",
    "this corresponds to the random phase approximation ( rpa ) renormalizations of pion propagators in migdal s theory of finite fermi systems @xcite .",
    "the retardation effects are included by evaluating the fock ( exchange ) self - energies of neutrons which are coupled to dynamical ( off - mass - shell ) pions .",
    "we determine numerically the resulting off - mass - shell gap function and wave - function renormalization self - consistently by solving the coupled integral equations for these two complex functions .    to elucidate our model , we start with the @xmath2-exchange interaction among neutrons in a low -density neutron matter relevant for the physics of neutron star crusts . in the density regime @xmath3 , where @xmath4 @xmath5 is the nuclear saturation density ,",

    "we shall formulate the model in terms of the real - time contour - ordered green s functions  @xcite . the imaginary time matsubara formalism is well suited for our purposes , since we assume the system to be in equilibrium , however , the numerical solution of the equations formulated on the real frequency axis are technically simpler compared to the solution of the imaginary time equations .",
    "the latter require a summation of finite number of discrete matsubara frequencies with a certain cutoff frequency which is followed by an analytical continuation to the real axis ; the former are solved directly on the real axis .",

    "<S> we develop a model of off - mass - shell pairing correlations in nuclear systems , which is based on the meson - exchange picture of nuclear interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the temporal retardations in the model are generated by the fock exchange diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> the kernel of the complex gap equation for baryons is related to the in - medium spectral function of mesons , which is evaluated nonperturbatively in the random phase approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the model is applied to the low - density neutron matter in neutron star crusts by separating the interaction into a long - range one - pion - exchange component and a short - range component parametrized in terms of landau fermi liquid parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting eliashberg - type coupled nonlinear integral equations are solved by an iterative procedure . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the self - energies extend to off - shell energies of the order of several tens of mev . at low energies </S>",
    "<S> the damping of the neutron pair correlations due to the coupling to the pionic modes is small , but becomes increasingly important as the energy is increased . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss an improved quasiclassical approximation under which the numerical solutions are obtained . </S>"
