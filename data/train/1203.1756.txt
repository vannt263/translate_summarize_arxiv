    "since its introduction by schrdinger , entanglement has remained an extensively studied and yet a mysterious aspect of quantum theory .",
    "entanglement appears as a by - product of the quantum formalism that assigns probability amplitudes to physical states and lets them exist in coherent superpositions . although , it runs counter to the human intuition gained through experiences with classical systems , experimental evidence has consistently favored the existence of such superposed quantum states .",

    "it can be put in one - to - one correspondence with entanglement for pure states , but , unlike entanglement , it can be nonzero for separable mixed states @xcite",
    ".    there have been long debates on the necessity of entanglement for quantum information processing . for example , the purity of typical spin systems used in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments is too small to exhibit entanglement ; nevertheless , nmr quantum information processing is considered an efficient test bed for quantum algorithms @xcite .",

    "ii.,width=340 ]    to understand the evolution of the density matrix during spin - lock , we consider a model consisting of exponential equilibration of the @xmath163 state with the other triplet states as well as an overall exponential decay of the singlet - triplet mixture toward the uniform identity state : @xmath164 here @xmath165 , and @xmath166 and @xmath167 are the decay constants . by fitting the attenuated fidelity of this model to the experimental attenuated fidelity , as shown in fig .",
    "[ spinlock](a ) , we determined @xmath168  ms and @xmath169  s. these values indicate the rapid equilibration of the triplet states and the long - lived nature of the singlet state .",
    "it can be noticed that @xmath170 is comparable to the rf period during the spin - lock , and @xmath171 is significantly longer than spin - lattice relaxation time constants ( @xmath172 values ) .",
    "we also measured discord during the spin - lock evolution using the methods described in sec .",
    "ii , and the results are plotted versus the spin - lock duration in fig .",
    "[ spinlock](b ) .",
    "the results for the extensive measurement method @xmath27 and geometric discord @xmath74 essentially agree ( when scaled by appropriate factors ) , as expected for accurate methods , and indicate that measurement errors in our experiments are rather small . by looking at angular variation of @xmath33 in the extensive measurement method , at @xmath160 when the state is closest to the isotropic werner state , we estimate that the imperfections in our prepared lls state give around 3% error to discord values .",
    "the discord @xmath173 obtained by assuming that the state is of bell - diagonal form is an overestimate initially but becomes almost the same as the other two determinations beyond @xmath174  ms .",
    "that means that artifact off - diagonal coherences are present in our prepared state , but they decay rapidly on a time scale comparable to @xmath170 . the discord value for the two - parameter model of eq.([twoparmodel ] ) is also shown in fig .",
    "[ spinlock](b ) .",
    "it is accurate once the state becomes bell - diagonal , but is unable to model the initial behavior .",
    "the reason for the initial discrepancy is that the off - diagonal components missing from eq.([twoparmodel ] ) alter both @xmath36 and @xmath33 .",
    "later evolution and the asymptotic vanishing of discord after long durations of spin - lock is governed by the time scale @xmath171 .",
    "over the years , several hypotheses have been proposed to characterize the nonclassical part of quantum correlations , e.g. , entanglement , violation of bell - type inequalities , uncertainty relations , quantum discord , and so on .",
    "they are not all equivalent , especially for mixed states .",
    "quantum discord aims to be the most inclusive of all of these , and we have focused our attention to the study of its dynamics in this work .    it is well known that under ordinary nmr conditions , the purity of an ensemble of nuclear spin systems is below the threshold to exhibit entanglement . however , successful demonstrations of nmr quantum information processing indicate that quantum correlations do exist in such ensembles . in our work",
    ", we have , first , revisited the theoretical basis of discord as well as geometric discord and then have described how they can be produced , manipulated , and monitored for an experimental density matrix , using the werner state as a specific example .",
    "we have also implemented several checks in our investigations to keep track of experimental imperfections .",
    "the experimental study of discord was carried out in two different systems . in one system , we studied preparation of discord using an entangling pulse sequence , and evolution of discord under dynamical decoupling sequences . under dd , discord did not show much improvement , but there was clear improvement in fidelity , which implies that dd protects against @xmath102-type decoherences but not against @xmath101-type decoherences . in the second system , we used the construction of the long - lived singlet state to prepare the werner state and examined its evolution under rf spin - lock .",
    "we can describe the accompanying evolution of fidelity and discord reasonably well using a simple relaxation model . in both systems , the experimentally observed behavior and",
    "the fit parameters are in good agreement with expectations from theory and simulations .",
