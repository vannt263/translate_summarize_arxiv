    "solitary waves that may occur in a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) have been traditionally discussed in terms of the classical gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) model which is appropriate for the description of weakly correlated systems @xcite .",
    "for instance , a simple soliton was obtained by tsuzuki @xcite in a homogeneous 1d model , while zakharov and shabat @xcite developed inverse - scattering techniques for the study of multisolitons .",
    "interestingly , the elementary soliton proved to be relevant for an accurate semiclassical description @xcite of an intriguing mode proposed earlier by lieb @xcite in a full quantum treatment of a 1d bose gas based on the bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "the above developments had long remained purely theoretical because of the absence of a physical realization of a strictly 1d bose gas . nevertheless , the picture has significantly changed with the recent observation of similar coherent structures in confined becs of alkali - metal atoms @xcite .",
    "the very method of experimental production of solitary waves ( phase imprinting ) was inspired by the analytical structure of the 1d soliton , while various effective 1d models have been developed for their theoretical investigation @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the actual stability of the theoretically predicted 1d solitary waves should be questioned within the proper 3d environment of realistic traps @xcite .",
    "an important step in that direction was the experimental observation @xcite that a dark soliton initially created in a finite trap eventually decays into vortex rings , as is also predicted by a numerical solution of the corresponding initial - value problem in a 3d classical gp model @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to carry out a calculation of potential nonlinear modes without _ a priori _ assumptions about their effective dimensionality .",
    "one could envisage a picture in which the actual solitary waves are hybrids of quasi-1d solitons and 3d vortex rings .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to make the above claim precise by calculating solitary waves that propagate along a cylindrical trap in a steady state with constant velocity @xmath0 .",
    "our approach was motivated by the calculation of vortex rings in a homogeneous bec due to jones and roberts @xcite and a similar calculation of semitopological solitons in planar ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "we have already described the main result of this work in a recent short communication @xcite but a substantial elaboration is necessary in order to appreciate its full significance . thus the problem is formulated in sec .",
    "ii where we also present a brief but complete recalculation of the ground state and the corresponding linear ( bogoliubov ) modes for comparison",
    ". a detailed calculation of nonlinear modes is given in sec .",
    "iii and the main conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "the physical picture that we have in mind is a slight idealization of the experiment in ref .",
    "thus we consider a cigar - shaped trap filled with atoms of mass @xmath1 .",
    "the transverse confinement frequency is denoted by @xmath2 and the corresponding oscillator length by @xmath3 .",
    "the longitudinal confinement frequency @xmath4 is assumed to be much smaller than @xmath2 , hence we make the approximation of an infinitely - long cylindrical trap with @xmath5 .",
    "accordingly , complete specification of the system requires as input the average linear density @xmath6 which is the number of atoms per unit length of the cylindrical trap .",
    "finally , we consider the two dimensionless combinations of parameters : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the scattering length related to the coupling constant as usual by @xmath9 .    now , in the actual experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , the trap is filled with @xmath10rb atoms , the transverse frequency is chosen as @xmath11 hz , the oscillator length is calculated to be @xmath12 , and the estimated linear density lies in the range @xmath13 . also taking into account a scattering length @xmath14 , the dimensionless parameters ( [ eq:21 ] ) take values in @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "in fact , our subsequent calculations will be carried out for a much wider range of the above parameters .",
    "therefore , apart from the idealization of a cylindrical trap , our results are fairly realistic and could be applied to a number of cases of experimental interest .",
    "it is useful to introduce rationalized units through the rescalings @xmath17 the energy functional extended to include a chemical potential is then given by @xmath18\\ , dv},\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "( [ eq:23 ] ) yields energy @xmath21 in units of @xmath22 whereas the chemical potential @xmath23 is measured in units of @xmath24 .",
    "the corresponding rationalized equation of motion reads @xmath25 and depends only on the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath26 , because @xmath19 and the chemical potential @xmath27 is fixed by the requirement that the system carry in its ground state a definite average linear density @xmath6 .",
    "an important first step is thus to obtain accurate information about the ground - state wave function @xmath28 which is normalized according to @xmath29 to conform with our choice of rationalized units . the wave function @xmath30 is numerically calculated as the minimum of the energy functional , under the constraint ( [ eq:25 ] ) that fixes the chemical potential @xmath31 , by a variant of a relaxation algorithm @xcite .",
    "explicit results are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] for some typical values of @xmath26 where we also quote the corresponding values of the chemical potential .",
    "the preceding numerical determination of the ground state will provide the basis for all subsequent calculations .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning here some limiting cases where the ground state is known analytically . at @xmath32 , @xmath33 and the chemical potential degenerates to @xmath34 . in the opposite limit , @xmath35",
    ", one may use the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation @xcite @xmath36^{1/2}\\ ] ] for @xmath37 , and @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "the chemical potential is given accordingly by @xmath40 .",
    "a comparison with the accurate numerical solution is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] for @xmath41 .",
    "in fact , as we shall see shortly , the tf approximation provides a reasonable description of some quantities of physical interest even for @xmath42 .",
    "we will also need some information from the linear ( bogoliubov ) modes which have already been calculated in the literature to varying degree of completeness @xcite . here",
    "we employ a numerical algorithm of our own briefly described as follows .",
    "equation ( [ eq:24 ] ) is linearized by inserting @xmath43 where @xmath30 is the calculated ground - state wave function while @xmath44 and @xmath45 are real functions that account for small fluctuations around the ground state .",
    "it is somewhat more convenient to use the linear combinations @xmath46 and @xmath47 which satisfy the linearized equations @xmath48 where @xmath49 our task is then to calculate the spectrum of the differential operator @xmath50 whose eigenvalues are purely imaginary and come in pairs @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the sought after physical frequency .",
    "we restrict attention to axially - symmetric waves that propagate along the @xmath53 axis with wave number @xmath54 .",
    "the laplace operator is then replaced by @xmath55 and the amplitudes @xmath8 and @xmath56 may be assumed to depend only on the radial distance @xmath57 .",
    "a finite - matrix approximation of the operator @xmath50 is obtained by expanding both @xmath8 and @xmath56 in terms of a basis set of non - orthogonal gaussian wave packets with randomly chosen oscillator lengths @xcite .",
    "it is also prudent to enlarge the basis set by including the ground - state wave function @xmath30 itself , in order to directly account for the zero ( goldstone ) mode associated with the number symmetry .",
    "the resulting algorithm is then quite efficient and provides stable approximations of the low - lying eigenvalues even if we include a small number of basis elements .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we present explicit results for the lowest eigenfrequency @xmath58 for the same set of coupling constants as in fig .",

    ", @xmath59 reduces to the free - particle quadratic dispersion @xmath60 , as expected . at nonzero @xmath26 ,",
    "the dispersion becomes linear near the origin , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the speed of sound for which explicit values are also quoted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "finally , we note that our results are in apparent agreement with the bogoliubov dispersion calculated earlier within the tf approximation @xcite as well as numerically @xcite  even though a different parameterization of the spectrum was employed in the latter reference .",
    "the speed of sound is a quantity of special physical interest and will also play an important role in the theoretical development of sec .",
    "hence we have carried out a calculation for a wider set of coupling constants and the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "it is interesting that our accurate numerical results are consistent with the tf approximation @xcite @xmath63 even for values of @xmath26 as low as 1 , where the error is about 5% , whereas the error is reduced to less than 1% for @xmath64 .",
    "this fact is especially important because eq .",
    "( [ eq:211 ] ) was employed for the analysis of experimental data @xcite .",
    "the relative accuracy of this approximation progressively deteriorates in the region @xmath65 , but a new asymptote , namely @xmath66 was predicted to be reached for sufficiently weak couplings @xcite . the weak - coupling approximation ( [ eq:212 ] )",
    "is actually consistent with our numerical data for @xmath67 , as is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "however , we should add that the linear part of the bogoliubov dispersion becomes very narrow in this region of couplings .",
    "we now turn to the calculation of axially - symmetric solitary waves traveling along the @xmath53 axis in a steady state with constant velocity @xmath0 .",
    "these are described by a wave function of the form @xmath68 , with @xmath69 , which is inserted in eq .",
    "( [ eq:24 ] ) to yield the stationary differential equation @xmath70 the wave function must vanish in the limit @xmath71 , thanks to the transverse confinement , while the condition @xmath72 enforces the requirement that the local particle density coincide asymptotically with that of the ground state calculated in sec .",
    "but the phase of the wave function is not fixed _ a priori _ at spatial infinity except for a mild restriction implied by the von neumann boundary condition @xmath73 adopted in our numerical calculation .",
    "our task is then to find concrete solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq:31 ] ) that satisfy the boundary conditions just described .",

    "@xmath75 is the linear momentum given by the usual definition @xmath76 and is measured in units of @xmath77 . in the second step of eq .",
    "( [ eq:35 ] ) we employ hydrodynamic variables defined from @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the local particle density and the phase @xmath80 may be used to construct the velocity field @xmath81 .",
    "numerical solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq:31 ] ) are obtained by an iterative newton - raphson algorithm @xcite briefly described as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath82 is an initial rough guess for the solution at some velocity @xmath0 .",
    "we then insert in eq .",
    "( [ eq:31 ] ) the configuration @xmath83 and keep terms that are at most linear in the amplitude @xmath84 .",
    "thus we derive an inhomogeneous differential equation of the form @xmath85 where the linear operator @xmath86 and the source @xmath87 are both calculated in terms of @xmath88 .",
    "we solve this linear system for @xmath89 to obtain @xmath90 which is used as input for the next iteration until convergence is achieved at some specified level of accuracy .",
    "the procedure is repeated by incrementing the velocity to a different value , typically in steps of @xmath91 , using as input the converged configuration obtained at the preceding value of the velocity .",
    "therefore , the main numerical burden consists of constructing a finite - matrix lattice approximation of the linear operator @xmath86 which is then inverted by standard routines appropriate for sparse linear systems .",
    "the newton - raphson algorithm typically converges after a few iterations and the final configuration is independent of the specific choice @xmath88 .",
    "but it is also clear that the algorithm will not converge for most choices of @xmath88 .",
    "hence it is important to invoke an educated guess for the input configuration provided by the product ansatz : @xmath92\\ , \\psi_0(\\rho)\\ ] ] which capitalizes on the analytically known solitary wave in the homogeneous 1d model @xcite and the ground - state configuration @xmath30 numerically calculated in sec .",
    "the constants @xmath93 and @xmath94 are definite functions of the velocity @xmath0 within the strictly 1d model , but such precise relations need not be invoked for our current purposes except for the normalization condition @xmath95 that is necessary to enforce the boundary condition ( [ eq:32 ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the above constants are treated here as trial parameters until we achieve convergence for a specific velocity @xmath0 .",
    "a corrolary of the preceding discussion is that the converged configuration does not depend on the precise choice of those parameters , and it is certainly not in the form of a product ansatz often employed for the derivation of effective 1d models @xcite . finally , we note that the ansatz ( [ eq:37 ] ) satisfies the parity relations @xmath96 which are compatible with eq .",
    "( [ eq:31 ] ) and are actually satisfied by all solutions constructed in the present paper .",
    "we begin with the special case of the relatively weak coupling @xmath97 for which the speed of sound was calculated to be @xmath98 in sec .",
    "ii . the simplest possibility is to first attempt to derive a static ( @xmath99 ) soliton starting with the input configuration ( [ eq:37 ] ) applied for , say , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "indeed , the algorithm quickly converges to a wave function with a nontrivial imaginary part but vanishing real part . the velocity is then incremented to positive values in steps of @xmath102 and the corresponding wave functions acquire also a nontrivial real part .",
    "the process may be continued until the velocity @xmath0 approaches the speed of sound @xmath62 beyond which the solitary wave ceases to exist .",
    "an equivalent sequence of solitary waves with velocities in the range @xmath103 is obtained either by starting again with the @xmath99 soliton and pushing it to negative velocities or , simply , by taking the complex conjugate of the wave function calculated for @xmath104 , since @xmath105 is an obvious symmetry of eq .",
    "( [ eq:31 ] ) . a detailed illustration of the calculated solitary wave function is given in fig .  [ fig:4 ] for two representative values of the velocity : @xmath106 and @xmath99 .",

    "( [ eq:35 ] ) , as expected .",
    "we finally note that the same phase difference @xmath116 which is important for experimental production of solitary waves through phase imprinting @xcite is also crucial for the calculation of the impulse .",

    "the apparent @xmath119 periodicity seems surprising , but occured also in the original calculation of a similar mode by lieb @xcite within a full quantum treatment of a 1d bose gas interacting via a @xmath120-function potential .",
    "the lieb mode was later rederived by a fairly accurate semiclassical approximation based on the elementary solitary wave of the 1d classical gp model @xcite .",
    "lieb further argued that the corresponding bogoliubov mode is no more elementary and thus proposed an intriguing dual interpretation of the excitation spectrum .",
    "it should be noted that the dispersions of the two modes exhibit the same linear dependence at low momenta , @xmath121 , where @xmath62 is the speed of sound , but significant differences arise at finite momenta .",
    "the differences are especially pronounced in the current calculation within a cylindrical trap .",
    "specifically , let us assume an average linear density @xmath122 which leads to @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",

    "[ fig:6 ] . in other words ,",
    "bogoliubov and lieb modes operate at rather different energy and momentum scales in a realistic trap .",
    "to summarize the preceding accurate calculation for @xmath97 , the solitary wave is essentially quasi-1d in this weak - coupling region and its main features are indeed captured by an effective 1d model @xcite .",
    "however , all cases of actual experimental interest @xcite are characterized by significantly larger values of the effective coupling where quasi-1d solitons are expected to be unstable @xcite . in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite suggests that a critical coupling occurs in a cylindrical trap when @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the maximum local particle density in the ground state of the trap .",
    "if we tentatively assume that the tf approximation ( [ eq:27 ] ) can be trusted at the anticipated critical coupling , the above criticality condition reads @xmath128 where @xmath26 is the dimensionless effective coupling constant defined in eq .",

    "the root of this equation @xmath129 provides a critical coupling @xmath130 above which quasi-1d solitons are predicted to be unstable @xcite .",

    "the emerging new picture is clear at @xmath132 which is the special case described in our recent short communication @xcite .",
    "this case is reanalyzed and further extended in the continuation of the present paper .",
    "it is natural to begin again with the calculation of a static ( @xmath99 ) soliton obtained by using the input configuration ( [ eq:37 ] ) with @xmath133 and practically any @xmath94 .",
    "we then increment the velocity to both positive and negative values in steps of @xmath134 to yield a sequence of solitary waves which now display two surprising features .",

    "[ fig:7 ] is thus a new local maximum of the energy - momentum dispersion , which is clearly distinguished from the local maximum at point iv that corresponds to the static black soliton discussed earlier in the text .",
    "one would think that pushing the velocity @xmath0 to negative values would somehow retrace the calculated sequence of vortex rings backwards .",
    "in fact , our algorithm continues to converge to vortex rings of smaller radii until the critical velocity @xmath158 is encountered where the ring achieves its minimum radius @xmath159 and ceases to exist for smaller values of @xmath0 .",

    "[ fig:7 ] .",
    "as one moves from point iii to point iv , the ringlike structure is more or less preserved at constant radius @xmath163 .",
    "nevertheless , the detailed features of the vortex ring are tamed at small velocities and completely disappear for @xmath99 to yield a black soliton at point iv .",
    "we thus essentially conclude our description of solitary waves for @xmath138 by schematically summarizing our main results in fig .",

    "simple inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] reveals that the group velocity becomes negative in the region ( ii , iii ) or , equivalently , the impulse is opposite to the group velocity .",
    "this rotonlike behavior is consistent with the onsager - feynman view of a roton as the ghost of a vanished vortex ring @xcite because the calculated radius of the vortex ring is monotonically decreasing along the fundamental ( i , ii , iii ) sequence . a full - scale roton would develop if the terminal point iii were an inflection point beyond which the group velocity begins to rise again . actually , this is exactly what happens as one moves away from point iii along the upper branch in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] , but this `` roton '' portion of the dispersion now appears in a strange location by comparison to the usual situation in liquid helium @xcite . on the other hand , the black soliton at the stationary point",
    "iv is indeed the ghost of a vanished vortex ring , as explained in the preceding paragraph .",
    "it is also interesting to question how the picture just described evolves with increasing values of the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath26 which is the only parameter that enters the rationalized gp equation .",
    "our numerical calculations have revealed yet another critical coupling @xmath164 , in the sense that new flavor arises for @xmath165 .",
    "the structure of the solitary waves in this new regime becomes sufficiently clear for @xmath166 and is best summarized by the calculated energy - momentum dispersion shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] .",

    "thus we consider the sequence of five characteristic points ( i , ii, ...",

    "again the ring achieves its minimum radius at the critical velocity @xmath160 ( point ii ) .",
    "the new element for @xmath170 is the intermediate branch ( ii , iii , iv ) that corresponds to double rings with velocities in the range @xmath172 .",
    "the second ring is first created at the flanks of the trap and comes closest to the original ring at the new critical velocity @xmath173 ( point iv ) .",
    "this double - ring configuration is more or less preserved along the upper branch ( iv , v ) , with velocities in the range @xmath174 , but gradually fades away to become a black soliton at @xmath99 ( point v ) .",
    "while the numerical calculation becomes increasingly more difficult for larger values of @xmath26 , it is clear that a sequence of critical couplings @xmath175 exists and leads to a hierarchy of axisymmetric vortex rings .",
    "the single - ring solution associated with the lowest branch of the spectrum is a robust feature for all @xmath131 and is likely stable to all perturbations .",
    "but it is possible that the multiple - ring configurations associated with the higher branches are unstable to non - axisymmetric perturbations . in this respect",
    ", one should recall that the solitary wave that corresponds to the upper branch in the original calculation of jones and roberts @xcite within the homogeneous gp model was later argued to be unstable @xcite .",
    "however , we should emphasize that the vortex rings constructed here differ significantly from the jones - roberts ( jr ) vortex ring that provided the basic motivation for the present work . as with ordinary smoke rings in fluid dynamics ,",
    "the jr ring can never be static thanks to a virial relation of the type ( [ eq:34 ] ) that prevents finite - energy solutions with @xmath99 in the homogeneous gp model . as a result",
    ", the radius of the vortex ring grows to infinity at low velocity .",
    "this picture is completely rearranged in a cylindrical trap because the occurrence of slow vortex rings with large radius is restricted by the boundaries of the trap . instead , vortex rings are predicted to nucleate at the flanks of the trap as soundlike pulses with high velocity approaching the speed of sound @xmath62 , and their radius actually decreases with decreasing velocity . in particular , it is now possible to obtain static ( @xmath99 ) vortex rings of finite radius that are no longer contradicted by the virial relation ( [ eq:34 ] ) .",
    "the structure of the energy - momentum dispersions calculated throughout the present paper clearly reflects the substantial restructuring of vortex rings within a cylindrical trap .",
    "it is then natural to question whether or not there exists a limit in which the jr vortex ring is recovered .",
    "one should expect that this may happen when the bulk healing length @xmath176 is significantly smaller than the transverse oscillator length @xmath177 .",
    "this limit is translated into large values of @xmath178 which is the only dimensionless parameter that enters the rationalized gp equation .",
    "now , our discussion earlier in this section suggests an increasingly complicated hierarchical structure in the strong - coupling limit rather that a simple jr soliton .",
    "a logical conclusion is that a jr vortex ring somehow created within the bulk will sooner or later sense the boundaries of the cylindrical trap .",
    "it will thus either directly dissipate into sound waves , or reorganize itself to conform with one or more of the presently calculated vortex rings possibly after ejecting some amount of radiation in the form of sound waves .",
    "the preceding remarks indicate a certain non - uniformity that is inherent in the approximation of the cigar - shaped trap by an infinitely - long cylindrical trap .",
    "the same phenomenon is also apparent in the calculation of linear modes in sec .",
    "ii . for instance , neither one of the two asymptotes for the speed of sound quoted in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:211 ] ) and ( [ eq:212 ] ) approaches the well - known bogoliubov speed in a homogeneous bose gas @xcite .",
    "but a non - uniformity of this type is not a reason to doubt that a sufficiently elongated trap can be approximated by an infinitely - long cylindrical trap .",
    "we have thus presented a complete 3d calculation of solitary waves in a cylindrical bose - einstein condensate . in all cases considered there exists a nontrivial phase difference @xmath116 that is reminiscent of strictly 1d solitons @xcite and is important for their experimental production through phase imprinting @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the detailed structure of the solitary waves depends crucially on the strength of the dimensionless effective coupling constant @xmath26 .",
    "quasi-1d solitons occur only in the weak - coupling region @xmath179 where some of our accurate numerical results could be approximated through effective 1d models @xcite . but a sufficiently strong coupling or density is necessary in order to pronounce the special features of a condensate .",
    "it is thus not surprising that the effective coupling in experiments performed so far lies in the region @xmath180 where the nature of the theoretically predicted solitary waves changes drastically .",
    "for @xmath180 solitary waves are still characterized by a nontrivial phase difference @xmath116 between the two ends of the trap but are otherwise 3d vortex rings .",
    "this finding is consistent with a recent experiment @xcite and a corresponding theoretical analysis @xcite in finite traps .",
    "the main mathematical advantage of the approximation of a sufficiently elongated trap by an infinitely - long cylindrical trap is that vortex rings can then be calculated in a steady state propagating with a constant velocity @xmath0 .",
    "it is thus possible to carry out a detailed study of the soliton profile as a function of the effective coupling constant @xmath26 and the velocity @xmath0 , as is done in the present paper .",
    "an interesting by - product of the above idealization is that a soliton is characterized by a definite energy - momentum dispersion .",
    "the calculated dispersion is found to be the direct analog of the lieb mode @xcite in the weak - coupling region and acquires interesting rotonlike features for stronger couplings .",
    "perhaps such a dispersion can be measured by a combination of phase imprinting @xcite with bragg spectroscopy recently employed for the detection of the usual bogoliubov mode @xcite . in this respect",
    ", one should keep in mind that bogoliubov and lieb modes operate at different energy and momentum scales in a realistic trap .",
    "this fact becomes evident by the different sets of physical units employed for the bogoliubov mode in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] and the lieb mode in , say , fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "the difference is accounted for by the second dimensionless coupling @xmath181 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:21 ] ) which is much stronger than @xmath178 because @xmath182 .",
