    "for the successful implementation of new functionalities using the spin degree of freedom in technological platforms , experimental techniques are required for the generation of spin polarization , transport across relevant length scales and polarization detection . for device applications of non - equilibrium electron spins , triggered by either optical @xcite or electrical techniques @xcite , the generation and detection of spin currents",
    "should be accomplished without the use of extremely strong magnetic fields and desirably using only electrical voltages . the electrical generation of spin polarization",
    "have been widely studied in semiconductor structures of different dimensionality such as bulk samples @xcite and in n- and p - doped quantum wells ( qws ) @xcite .",
    "the transport of spins polarized by an electrical current is of great interest not only due to the emergence of new phenomena but also due to possible applications in spin based electronics @xcite",
    ". transverse transport of in - plane current - induced spin polarization ( cisp ) have been studied in l - shaped strained n - ingaas channels @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been reported that the spins polarized in the out - of - plane direction by the spin hall effect ( she ) can be drive long distances in n - doped gaas epilayers @xcite . in this paper , we report on the electrical generation of spin polarization in two - dimensional electron gases under the action of spin - orbit fields and the spin transport over distances exceeding half millimetre away from current path in a transverse direction .",
    "the structure discussed in this manuscript is gaas / algaas triple quantum well ( tqw ) , containg a dense two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) grown in the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "the structure is symmetrically @xmath1-doped , with total density @xmath2 and low temperature mobility @xmath3 .",
    "it contains a 26-nm - thick gaas central well with electron density of about @xmath4 and two 12-nm - thick lateral wells with approximately equal electron density of @xmath5 , each separated by 1.4-nm - thick al@xmath6ga@xmath7as barriers .",
    "[ fig : lcisp ] ( a ) shows the calculated tqw band structure and subband charge density , where the black lines show the potential profile and the color lines show the first ( dark yellow ) , second ( orange ) and third ( violet ) occupied subbands . for the electrical generation of spin polarization",
    "the sample was patterned into a six - contact hall bar geometry .",
    "the main channel have length l = 500 @xmath8 between the side probes ( in the y - axis ) , width @xmath9 = 200 @xmath8 and four transverse channels of equal width 15 @xmath8 that extend out from the main channel ( in the x - axis ) as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcisp ] ( b ) .",
    "the current - induced spin polarization was measured by using the optical kerr rotation ( kr ) technique .",
    "the spin polarization was generated by an electrical voltage modulated at @xmath10 = 1.1402 khz for lock - in detection .",
    "a weak linearly polarized probe beam emitted from a pulsed ti : sapphire laser was scanned on the structure for the spatial detection of the induced spin polarization .",
    "the polarization of the reflected beam was measured by a balanced photodetector and lock - in amplifier operating at @xmath11 .",
    "the laser wavelength was tuned for maximum kr signal .",
    "w.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    the sample was immersed in the variable temperature insert of a split coil superconductor magnet in the voigt geometry .      in the longitudinal configuration ,",
    "the kr was measured as a function of external magnetic fields while applying v@xmath12 at the central channel ( 1 - 2 ) [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : lcisp ] ( b ) ] .",
    "if the ensemble coherence time ( @xmath13 ) is longer than the pulse repetition ( with mhz frequency ) the signal does not fully decay from the previous pulse and overlaps with the signal generated by the following pulses . due to the constructive interference at certain resonant fields , the amplification of the precession ( with ghz frequency ) of those electrically polarized spin occurs and result in sharp resonance peaks .",
    "these resonance peaks with spacing @xmath14 obey the periodic condition @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the laser repetition rate @xcite .",
    "[ fig : lcisp ] ( c ) displays the rsa pattern as a function of the external magnetic field for several applied voltages .",
    "the cisp amplitude increases with the increase of applied voltage and reaches its maximum value at 3 v. however , further increase of the applied voltage results in a strong reduction of the amplitude possibly due to heating effects @xcite .",
    "[ fig : lcisp ] ( d ) displays the dependence of the cisp amplitude on the probe wavelength at a fixed voltage of 3 v. furthermore , the hole spin coherence time involved in the generation of the electron spin coherence , causes the reinforcement of the resonant peak amplitude at higher magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the experimental conditions for maximum signal amplitude , namely @xmath17 = 3 v and @xmath18 = 817 nm , were used in the following section .",
    "now we switch from to the longitudinal transport to the transverse transport .",
    "in contrast to the longitudinal transport , where the spin polarization was measured in a region where the local current flows , we measured the spin polarization in a region with minimal electric field .",
    "for example , when @xmath17 is applied along the main channel ( y - direction ) the transverse transport will be into the side arms ( x - direction ) of the hall bar .",
    "the reflectivity of the structure imaged as function of the position ( x , y ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcisp ] ( b ) .",
    "the reflectivity map displays the central channel and the four transverse voltage probes .",
    "the solid lines highlight the possible current paths and the red regions separate the conducting areas where the white lines are the edges of those regions . in fig .",

    "we observed the transverse drift of the cisp in a scan of about @xmath21y = 0.4 mm .",
    "we also observed that the spacing @xmath22b between the rsa peaks varies with the position .",
    "one can clearly see that the outer peaks are shifted towards higher fields for an increasing y - position indicating the variation of the @xmath0-factor as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcisp ] ( b ) .",
    "recently , the @xmath23-factor modification in a bulk ingaas epilayer by an in - plane electric field was studied @xcite .",
    "they found a dependence of @xmath24 on the drift velocity : @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , the dependence of the electrical @xmath0 tensor variation on the magnetic field was also reported in quantum wells @xcite .",
    "our data gives a @xmath0-factor variation in agreement with those reports .    to extract the spin lifetime and polarization amplitude ,",
    "the magnetic field scans were fitted using a lorentzian function @xmath26 $ ] with @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the larmor frequency , @xmath29 is the reduced planck s constant , @xmath30 is the bohr magneton and b@xmath31 is the peak half - width .",
    "the extracted parameters are plotted in fig .",
