    "in the spring of 1999 preliminary runs of the cresst dark matter search  @xcite were carried out at the gran sasso laboratory ( lngs ) , a deep underground laboratory for low background physics located in the apennines . in these first runs of cresst",
    "a phenomenon was observed which we believe may be of interest for the study of crack and fracture formation in brittle materials .",
    "cresst is a cryogenic detector , working in the vicinity of 10 milli - kelvin  @xcite .",
    "in addition to being deep underground for shielding against cosmic rays , it is carefully designed to minimize effects of radioactive background .",
    "the elements were large ( 262 gram ) high quality single crystals of sapphire , with a strip of ( w ) evaporated on one surface to serve as a sensitive thermometer .",
    "this system , as shown by tests with gamma ray sources , detects single events in the with energies in the range from about 1 kev to several hundred kev with good energy resolution ( 0.5 kev ) and good time resolution ( 40 or 100 @xmath4s for the onset of a pulse ) .    in order to reach these low temperatures",
    "it is important to eliminate the effects of any vibrations ( `` microphonics '' ) that might deliver energy to the crystal .",
    "thus in addition to special suspensions to isolate the apparatus , the crystals are held very tightly in their holders to prevent any even microscopic frictional effects . in the data to be discussed here this was effected by small balls held against the crystal by a plastic clamp .",
    "the plastic of the clamp , delrin , is known to contract substantially at low temperature , thus providing additional `` tight holding '' .",
    "an unanticipated result of the small contact area of the hard balls and the great force of the clamp turned out to be a cracking or fracturing of the .",
    "this was observed as follows .    when the was first brought into operation , an unexpectedly high rate of signal pulses was observed .",
    "initial fears that this might be due to an unexpected radioactive contamination were relieved by the observation that even an unknown radioactive contamination must be poisson distributed in time , while the unexpected pulses appeared rather to come in  bursts \" or `` avalanches '' .",
    "examination of the time distributions showed that they were indeed non - poissonian .    _ pulse formation and fractures : _ the pulses themselves resembled those seen from good particle events . however , this is a rather unspecific criterion , due to the operating characteristics of the .",
    "there are essentially three steps in the production of a signal pulse 1 ) a relatively localized energy release within a short time , 2 ) a rapid degradation of this energy into a uniform `` hot '' ( @xmath5 ) gas of phonons produced through phonon - phonon interaction and decay , as well as interaction with the crystal surface , 3 ) absorption of the phonons in the thermometer strip .",
    "this leads to a heating with an increase of electrical resistance for the , which is finally read out by squid electronics . the resulting pulse shape is well described by a model employing the various thermal and electrical parameters of the @xcite .",
    "as may be seen from this brief description , the pulse shape is essentially determined by the thermal responses of the system and not by the initiating event , as long as it is `` fast '' .",
    "hence any release of a given energy in the crystal in a short time ( @xmath4 seconds ) leads to the same pulse shape and so examination of the pulses does not lead to an identification of their origin .",
    "an extensive search for the origin of the pulses was finally successful when it was noticed that there appeared to be markings or scratches on the crystal at the contact points with the balls .",
    "when the balls were replaced by plastic stubs , which are evidently much softer , the event rate immediately dropped from some thousands per hour to the expected few per hour .",
    "these observations strongly suggest that the pulses were due to some kind of cracking or micro - fracturing phenomena in the crystal and/or its support balls .",
    "indeed , examination under a microscope revealed a small crater with radiating irregular fissures extending sideways and down into the crystal .",
    "damage to the sapphire balls was also observed . since the reduction in rate",
    "after the exchange of the balls was so large , we believe the data taken with the balls are essentially all fracture events .",
    "if we accept this crack or fracture hypothesis , our data then represent a large sample of well measured fracture events , under low background conditions , and with good time and energy determination .",
    "_ calibration runs : _ in order to calibrate the energy scale regular calibration runs were carried out . in these runs the system is left undisturbed and a radioactive source supplying 120 kev photons ( which can penetrate to the detectors ) is inserted in an external plug in the shielding .",
    "these photon - induced events can be selected by using the resulting 120 kev peak in the data .",
    "since a radioactive source produces statistically independent events , that is poisson statistics , these events provide a useful comparison when studying statistical properties of the data .",
    "we believe this is the first time that the energy release in microfracture has been accurately measured on a microscopic event - by - event basis .    it is to be emphasized that the cryogenic method provides an _ absolute _ measurement of the _ total _ energy release in the fracture . this is to be contrasted with the study of acoustic emission in materials or seismic measurements of earthquakes .",
    "there the energy determination is necessarily indirect since there are various assumptions and uncertainties concerning production , propagation , and detection involved in translating the observed signals into the true energy of the event . on the other hand",
    "the cryogenic method , essentially calorimetric in character , is a direct measurement of the full energy .",
    "the energy scale is fixed by the calibration with known sources and the resulting accuracy of the cresst energy determination is on the order of a few percent  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the directness of the energy measurement an important feature of the cryogenic method is its great sensitivity .",
    "the closest previous technique appears to be the study of acoustic emission in materials  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "there the smallest emitting region considered is on the order of a square micron  @xcite .",
    "this will correspond to the breaking of @xmath6 bonds in the crystal . on the other hand ,",
    "our energy threshold is typically some kev ( fig .",
    "this corresponds to the breaking of only a few hundred or thousand bonds .",
    "thus the cryogenic method appears to be many orders of magnitude more sensitive than previous technique .",
    "small cryogenic devices can even be sensitive to energies in the ev range  @xcite and it is possible that studies of this type involving stress release of only a few atoms are feasible  @xcite .    in fig .  1 we show the differential distribution @xmath7 for the number of events @xmath8 per unit energy , for four data sets with two detectors from run9 .",
    "the straight line is the result of a power law fit @xmath9 to the lowest curve , which yields @xmath10 .",
    "similar results are found from fits to other data sets . from a total of seven sets examined ( from runs 9 , 10 and 11 ) @xmath11 ranged between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "an interesting point is that the rates do not appear to differ greatly from one data set to another , despite the fact that different crystals and mountings are often involved . at 21 kev for example",
    ", the rates over the various data sets vary between 4 and 11 pulses / kev - hr .",
    "yielding @xmath10 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    a power law of this type , called the gutenberg - richter law  @xcite , is well known for the `` magnitudes '' of earthquakes .",
    "unfortunately the `` magnitude '' is a seismic amplitude and not a direct measurement of the energy of an earthquake . thus a simple comparison is not possible .",
    "however if one takes the prescription that the seismic amplitude to approximately the 3/2 power  @xcite,@xcite represents the energy , and uses the power @xmath14 found for the _ integral _ distribution of earthquake magnitudes  @xcite , it corresponds to @xmath15 , not far from our @xmath16 . of course , the six orders of magnitude range available for seismic data is much greater than the one or two orders of magnitude available here .",
    "it should also be noted that such power law , that is scale free , distributions appear in many phenomena , often related to an underlying fractal process  @xcite . in the acoustic emission recordings of microfracture events in brittle materials for example , such a distribution typically appears , with a somewhat lower exponent , @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "_ waiting time distributions : _ a useful quantity in the study of intermittent data such as the present is the `` waiting time '' @xmath1 . to each event",
    "@xmath18 we assign @xmath19 , the time interval till the next event , and study the distribution of these intervals .",
    "2 shows the waiting time distribution for detector 2 in a 28 hr data set of run 9 .",
    "the distribution has power law behavior at small @xmath1 and an exponential fall off at large @xmath1 , and an accurate fit is obtained with @xmath20 , with @xmath21 .",
    "similar results are found for other data sets with @xmath22 in the range 0.25 - 0.5 .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 determines the location of the crossover from power law to exponential and is essentially the inverse rate or average waiting time , with @xmath24 .",
    "qualitatively similar results , with @xmath22 near to or somewhat less than one , have been reported for earthquakes in california  @xcite .",
    "lower curve : photon - induced events from a calibration run , fit to @xmath25.,title=\"fig : \" ]    for the simple case of poisson statistics , one expects a waiting time distribution @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the average count rate .",
    "the lower curve of fig .",
    "2 shows the waiting time distribution for the photon - induced events of a calibration run , with a fit to @xmath25 . as expected there is a good fit , and with @xmath26 in agreement with the event rate .",
    "an interesting point concerns the behavior of @xmath23 for fracture events as the the energy threshold for the sample is raised .",
    "it appears that the form @xmath27 is preserved , with @xmath22 varying little .",
    "since the count rate is reduced however , the value of @xmath23 increases and so the crossover between power law and exponential behavior moves to larger @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , taking a given data set ( run9-d2,@xmath28 ) , repeatedly raising the energy threshold and fitting for @xmath23 , we find a linear relation between the inverse count rate , that is @xmath29 , and the fitted @xmath23 .",
    "the slope and the relation @xmath24 then gives a global determination @xmath30 .",
    "the power law behavior for the waiting times at small @xmath1 , as well as the power law for the energy distribution in the previous section , is suggestive of an underlying scale - free processes without any intrinsic dimensional parameter , as is common in fractal processes  @xcite .",
    "however this can not be entirely true here since @xmath23 is a time and has dimensions .",
    "since @xmath31 corresponds in fact to a poisson distribution , this may suggest an interpretation in terms of some basic scale free processes where several such processes are occurring independently and simultaneously and so are overlapping in the data .",
    "this arises trivially if the signals originate from more than one of the support points of the crystal , of which there were several ; but one can also imagine independent crack systems beneath one support point .",
    "the increase of @xmath23 as the count rate goes down suggests that the limit of zero count rate is a kind of critical point : the waiting time becomes infinite as the distribution becomes non - integrable and completely scale free , while @xmath26 appears as a diverging correlation length .",
    "understanding @xmath23 is an interesting point for further study .",
    "_ correlations in time : _ we expect the existence of correlations in time , corresponding to the  bursts \" or `` avalanches '' .",
    "we use the event rate @xmath32 of a calibration run to construct the autocorrelation function @xmath33 and compare @xmath34 for photon - induced events and fractures in fig .",
    "3 . while for photons we have @xmath35 as expected , for the microfractures there are correlations lasting for substantial fractions of an hour .",
    "these long - term correlations are found for the fracture events of all data sets .",
    "the physical origin of the correlations may be in stress relaxation phenomena where a slow  diffusion \" of strain  @xcite can trigger new microfractures when meeting other weak spots in the crystal .     for the event rate from calibration data of run10 .",
    "the lower curve is for photon - induced events ( events in the 120 kev peak ) , and the upper curve is for fractures plus some admixture of compton scatters ( events below the peak ) . for the photons",
    "the data is consistent with @xmath35 for @xmath36 as expected for poisson statistics , with @xmath37.,title=\"fig : \" ]    _ hurst exponent : _ the autocorrelations as in fig .",
    "3 can be approximately fit to power laws @xmath38 . as noted above",
    ", this is suggestive of the scale free , self - similar behavior associated with fractal statistics .",
    "a way of characterizing such behavior is in terms of what is called the hurst exponent h ; and we can check the plausibility of such a description by comparing the consistency of h found in different ways",
    ". table i shows h found in three ways for various data sets .",
    "first the autocorrelation exponent @xmath39 is fitted to find @xmath40 .",
    "the next column shows @xmath41 determined by the  growth of the standard deviation \" , a characterization of the fluctuations in the event rate @xmath42 where @xmath43 would be the classical gaussian or random walk behavior with finite range correlations .",
    "finally , the last column gives @xmath41 found from the `` shannon entropy '' , related to the probability of the number of events over a time interval @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "although the fits were not all excellent and there is considerable fluctuation in the results , the overall rough consistency of the three determinations supports the picture of a scale free , self - similar process .",
    "we do not necessarily expect the same @xmath41 for different data sets since these involve different energy thresholds and sensitivities .",

    "a frequently used concept in the earthquake literature is the  omori cluster \" : a `` big shock '' followed by `` aftershocks '' . as fig .",
    "1 shows , and as is also the case for earthquakes , there is no separate class of high energy events  no distinctive `` big shocks '' . naturally ,",
    "as should be expected from the `` avalanches '' or correlations , given any event , there is a general increase in rate at nearby times .",
    "although this increase is quite substantial , ( a factor four with one second bins , see fig .",
    "4 ) this simply reflects the  bursts \" or  avalanches \" and is not specific to `` big events '' .    more specific to `` big events '' , however , we find a time asymmetry with respect to `` before '' and `` after '' .",

    "our material is a single crystal of high purity@xcite . in crack propagation models",
    "the growing stress enhancement at the crack tip implies that a `` hard spot '' is necessary to limit the propagation of a crack ; thus when a homogeneous stress is applied to a defect - free material there is nothing to stop a propagating crack .",
    "presumably the microfractures here were limited by the random , non - homogeneous stress and defect field which quickly arises as fractures form in the pure material .",
    "this may have been assisted by the damage to the small sapphire balls , leading to an irregular application of the stress .",
    "although we speak of `` cracks '' , it should be kept in mind that from our simple observation of pulses we can not infer the exact nature of the microfracture .",
    "finally , with respect to materials it should be noted that our system is of course quite opposite to those in the geological context , where one has highly heterogeneous systems , while here we have a very pure material .",
