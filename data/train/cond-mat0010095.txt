    "consider a system of @xmath0 identical bosons in one dimension , with an attractive delta - function interaction . there is a bound state for all @xmath0 , having the form of a well - localized `` molecule''@xcite .",
    "this result is interesting , since it is the unique example of an exactly solved localized many - body system",
    ". a possible experimental realization of this system would be in a @xmath1 vapor @xcite confined to an atomic trap which is so tight in two directions , that the system can be regarded as one - dimensional with respect to the third direction .",
    "such traps are realistic prospects in the near future @xcite , and high - aspect ratio cigar - shaped traps approximating quasi - one - dimensional systems are already available experimentally @xcite .",
    "we seek the localized eigenfunctions @xmath2x@xmath3 of the hamiltonian @xmath4 wherein @xmath5 is the particle mass and @xmath6 is a positive parameter representing the strength of interparticle attraction .",
    "the wavefunction and many derived quantities can be given exactly and in closed form ; however , it is useful to first consider the mean - field version of this theory . the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) approximation @xcite assumes that @xmath7 can be written as a simple product of wavefunctions @xmath8 where the @xmath9 are eigenfunctions for a single particle moving in the average potential of all the others @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "thus the ground - state wavefunction @xmath12 is actually determined by solving a nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "we will show that this approximation generally captures the physics of the large @xmath0 limit ; this is in contrast to the case of repulsive bosons in one dimension , for which the interaction terms must be treated more carefully @xcite .",
    "the solution to eq.(3 ) is @xmath13 where @xmath14 ; the single particle energy is @xmath15 .",
    "this has the implications for the many - body problem that there can be a state that is localized in the sense that it is unlikely that any particle be found far from the center of mass , and provides an estimate for the particle density ( with the center of mass fixed at the origin ) @xmath16 ; the corresponding ground state energy is @xmath17 .",
    "it can be shown that there are no other bound states of eq .",
    "( 3 ) for the potential v(x ) constructed from the ground state wavefunction .",
    "this suggests that we can not construct approximate localized excited states of the boson molecule by symmetrizing @xmath18 ( for some appropriate choice of @xmath19 ) .",
    "the gp wavefunction is not translationally invariant , and thus violates momentum conservation .",
    "every translation of it is a solution to the same self - consistent equation with the same energy ; then by forming the linear combination @xmath20 we can restore this symmetry .",
    "for the case @xmath21 , the wavefunction can be found by changing to relative coordinates , giving a problem equivalent to a single particle and a fixed potential well .",
    "the ( unnormalized ) ground state wavefunction is @xmath22 where @xmath14 ; the corresponding energy is @xmath23 . for @xmath24",
    "the delta function vanishes , and the wavefunction is an eigenfunction of the kinetic energy operator ; for a bound state this is the product of exponential functions with real argument . the potential generates the discontinuity in the derivative of @xmath25 at the crossing point @xmath26 .",
    "these two properties hold for all @xmath0 , so that we can write down the general ( unnormalized ) wavefunction as @xcite @xmath27 for the sector @xmath28 this can also be written in the form @xmath29 in view of the exchange symmetry of bosons , this completely describes the wavefunction .",
    "the ground state energy is proportional to the sums of the squares of the coefficients of @xmath30 in the argument of the exponential ; explicitly , @xcite @xmath31 this agrees with the gp result only in leading order in @xmath0 .",
    "the implications of the wavefunction are more clearly revealed when reduced to the probability that there is a particle at position @xmath32 relative to the center of mass . for the case",
    "@xmath33 , there can only be a particle at @xmath32 if the other is at @xmath34 , and then the probability is proportional to the square of the wavefunction : @xmath35 this has been normalized so that the integral over all @xmath32 gives @xmath21 .    for larger @xmath0",
    "we integrate over the unconstrained degrees of freedom ; for example for @xmath36 the probability of finding a particle at @xmath37 is proportional to @xmath38 where the integrals describe the case that it is particle 3 or particle 2 that is at @xmath32 ( particle 1 is necessarily in the region @xmath39 ) .",
    "the resulting normalized probability distribution is @xmath40 =   3\\cdot 2\\alpha [ z - { \\frac 1 2 } z^{2}]\\ ] ] where in the second representation we have introduced the abbreviation @xmath41 . in a similar way @xmath42 can be constructed for other small @xmath0 .",
    "the results for @xmath43 suggest the general expression ( given previously by yoon and negele@xcite ) @xmath44 this has been normalized so that the integral over all @xmath32 gives @xmath0 .",
    "the density at @xmath45 is @xmath46 .",
    "an interesting feature of the distributions is revealed when we represent them as a power series in @xmath47 : the coefficients of @xmath48 vanish when @xmath49 is odd and less than @xmath50 .",
    "thus the discontinuity in slope at @xmath45 that is present in @xmath51 is replaced by a discontinuity in a much higher derivative for larger @xmath0 ( see footnote 7 ) .",
    "this property is a demonstrable consequence of the representation ( 12 ) ; in fact , combined with the assumption that @xmath42 is a polynomial in @xmath52 of order @xmath53 , this is sufficient to determine the form of @xmath42 up to normalization .    in the limit of large @xmath0 ,",
    "( 12 ) reduces to @xmath54 which has form similar to the gp result @xmath55 sech@xmath56 figure 1 shows @xmath57 as a function of @xmath58 , for various @xmath0 .",
    "we may also characterize @xmath59 through its moments .",
    "starting from ( 12 ) it can be shown that @xmath60 @xmath61 the gp theory would give @xmath62 ( and similarly for @xmath63 )  they agree at large @xmath0 , but the exact result approaches the asymptotic limit from below , while gp approaches from above .",
    "the single - particle green function @xmath64 is calculated from the wavefunction by constructing the product @xmath65 and integrating out the spectator coordinates @xmath66 .",
    "explicit construction of the @xmath64 for @xmath67 suggests the result @xmath68 \\ } z^{k(m )   } \\ ] ] where @xmath69 and @xmath70/4 $ ] . with the choice @xmath71",
    ", @xmath72 is normalized so that @xmath73 ; a physically more meaningful normalization would be to choose @xmath74 , but we have not succeeded in finding the closed form representation for the corresponding @xmath75 . since @xmath76 , the sum contains every term twice , except for @xmath77 when @xmath0 is odd .    in the large @xmath0 limit , @xmath78 and then @xmath79 which is the green function that one would construct from the translationally invariant gp wavefunction @xmath80 .",
    "the momentum distribution is the fourier transform of g@xmath81 @xmath82^{2 } } [ n^{2}-1 - 4k ]   \\alpha \\}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 is the wavevector .",
    "figure 2 gives a graph of @xmath84 versus @xmath85 , for various @xmath0 .",
    "as in the case of the repulsive boson system@xcite , the momentum distribution is smooth : there is no bose condensation .",
    "the width of the momentum distribution is set by the parameter @xmath86 , so that the momentum distribution for the noninteracting case ( @xmath87 ) is attained in a natural way . in a highly localized wavefunction",
    "we would hardly expect to find _ long - range _ off - diagonal order !",
    "the two - point correlation function is calculated from the squared wavefunction by choosing one of the particles to be @xmath88 and another to be at @xmath89 ( in all possible ways ) , and integrating out all other @xmath90 .",
    "we have chosen to normalize @xmath91 so that the integral over all @xmath32 gives unity .",
    "it proved harder to analyze , because its representation is more irregular : for example , @xmath92\\ ] ] where again @xmath69 .",
    "based on the explicit construction of @xmath93 for @xmath43 , we find @xmath94 k(m ) + \\alpha   |x| [ n^{2 } - 4 k(m ) ] k(m)^{2 } \\ } w^{k(m)}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 . since @xmath96 , the sum contains every term twice , except for @xmath97 when @xmath0 is even . the special value at @xmath45 ( which is the probability of having two particles at the same place ) is @xmath98 .",
    "figure 3 gives a graph of @xmath99 for various @xmath0 . in the limit of large @xmath0",
    ", we may approximate @xmath100 in the prefactors and then @xmath101 , with the result @xmath102 the structure factor is given by the fourier transform of @xmath91 : @xmath103 \\over k^{2}+ k(m)^{2 } } - { [ n^{2 } - 4 k(m)][k(m)^{2}-k^{2}]\\over   [ k^{2}+ k(m)^{2}]^{2 } } \\}\\ ] ]",
    "in this section we will show that for any @xmath0 there is only one localized state with zero total momentum .",
    "there are other states of negative energy , but these can all be interpreted as uncorrelated smaller molecules .    for indistinguishable bosons we need only specify the wavefunction for the sector @xmath104 , and in the interior of this region ( where no two coordinates are equal ) , the hamiltonian operator reduces to the kinetic energy .",
    "the bound eigenstates of the kinetic energy have the form @xmath105 and the energy is determined to be @xmath106 m . to be normalizable",
    "it is necessary that @xmath107 ( otherwise a uniform translation of all the particles could lead to indefinite growth of @xmath25 ) .",
    "the wavefunction for the interacting system is a linear combination of degenerate functions of this form . at the sector boundaries ( where @xmath108 for some j ) , the interaction gives rise to a discontinuity in the derivative of the wavefunction , which implies@xcite @xmath109 this must hold for arbitrary choices of the remaining @xmath110 variables",
    "; then in the sum of terms of the form ( [ eq19 ] ) the only terms that are coupled by ( [ eq20 ] ) are those for which the lists @xmath111 differ only at @xmath112 and @xmath113  but then the two sum constraints on the @xmath111 ensure that there are only two such lists , which differ by having the values for @xmath112 and @xmath113 interchanged .",
    "thus the general form of the wavefunction would appear to be constructable from a single list @xmath111 ( which we will take to be ordered , so that @xmath114 for all @xmath115 in the form @xmath116 where the first sum is over all permutations of @xmath0 objects , and @xmath117 is the @xmath118 member of the permuted list .",
    "the boundary condition ( [ eq20 ] ) implies relations among the coefficients @xmath119 @xmath120 ( it should be noted that the permutations @xmath121 and @xmath122 are related so that @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the foregoing differs only slightly from the case of bosons with repulsive delta - potential interactions@xcite  the main difference is that the @xmath125 are real instead of purely imaginary .",
    "however , the remaining boundary conditions are different : for repulsive interactions , the wavefunction is delocalized and must be confined within a periodic box , while for attractive interactions , the space can be infinite if the wavefunction itself is localized .",
    "the relevant ( and interesting ) condition is that @xmath126 should become exponentially small if the extremal particle at @xmath127 is moved to large positive @xmath32 , or if the particle at @xmath128 is moved to large negative @xmath32 .",
    "this requires that @xmath129 be positive and @xmath130 be negative , for every term in ( [ eq21 ] ) that has nonzero coefficient .",
    "the sum itself is over all permutations , which certainly will generate terms in which the k s have the wrong sign ; but the coefficients will vanish ( according to ( [ eq22 ] ) ) for all permutations such that in the list @xmath131 it happens there are members @xmath132 and @xmath133 such that @xmath134 and @xmath135 . the ground state wavefunction is a simple example of the working of this rule : the ordered list is of the form of a sequence @xmath136 and every possible permutation of it gives rise to a vanishing coefficient .",
    "the ground state is not the only possibility : we could have a list which is made of several distinct sequences , so that in one of its permutations it takes the form @xmath137 .",
    "this gives some freedom in the choice for the starting elements @xmath138 and sublist lengths @xmath139 ; this generates the wavefunction for an excited state of the molecule .",
    "however , it does not represent a localized state .",
    "suppose we simultaneously displace the particles @xmath140 a large distance to negative values .",
    "if @xmath141 , this term will become exponentially large , giving a nonnormalizable wavefunction .",
    "however , if @xmath142 there will be a different permutation of the list in which this sublist is at the end , again giving a nonnormalizable wavefunction when these particles are moved to large positive values .",
    "the remaining possibility is @xmath143  but now the wavefunction remains finite if it is separated into two widely separated pieces , one of which contains @xmath144 particles : this describes states in which the particles have formed several separate and uncorrelated molecules .    in the foregoing argument",
    "we have assumed that the @xmath111 are real . allowing them to be complex does not change the situation much :",
    "the argument above implies that the k@xmath145 having a real part must be organizable into sublists as above , all having the same imaginary part ; each sublist represents a separated molecule , now with finite momentum . from this point of view",
    "we can readily see that when two molecules collide , nothing happens ",
    "they pass through each other leaving each undisturbed@xcite .",
