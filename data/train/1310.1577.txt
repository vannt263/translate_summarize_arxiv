    "the main tool that will be used is the version of seidel s isomorphism established in theorem [ thm : isom ] .",

    "in particular , the singular homology of an exact lagrangian filling of @xmath4 can be computed by a complex generated by the reeb chords on @xmath4 .    a more general version of this result appeared in ( * ? ? ? * section 11 ) .",
    "even though the latter version is formulated for closed contact manifolds , it can be adapted to work in the current setting as well .",
    "also , we refer to @xcite for a version of this isomorphism obtained using the theory of generating families instead of pseudo - holomorphic curves .",
    "since we are interested in studying exact lagrangian cobordisms , the following long exact sequence obtained using seidel s isomorphism is important .",

    "there is a long exact sequence @xmath94 in the non - spin case , the same long exact sequence exists with @xmath92 .",
    "moreover , if we take the grading in the wrapped floer homology groups to be induced by the grading in singular homology via seidel s isomorphism , then the grading in the above long exact sequence may be taken to be in the integers .",

    "the main ingredient used in the proof is seidel s isomorphism .",
    "observe that we do not make any assumptions on the maslov class of @xmath5 nor on @xmath4 in theorem  [ maintheoremsameranks ]    the self - linking number of @xmath4 with itself pushed slightly in the reeb direction is called the thurston - bennequin invariant , which is a legendrian isotopy invariant . in the case when @xmath28 , an orientable lagrangian cobordism @xmath5 from @xmath104 to @xmath105 satisfies @xmath106 we refer to @xcite for the proof in the case when @xmath107 .",
    "the proof of chantraine can be naturally extended to the case of arbitrary @xmath22 .",

    "it is natural to ask whether every exact lagrangian cobordism described in theorem  [ maintheoremsameranks ] is diffeomorphic to @xmath116 . in section",

    "having an exact lagrangian filling is known to have strong implications for the legendrian submanifold .",
    "one important reason is that these fillings give rise to augmentations , which themselves have strong geometric implications ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one could therefore expect that some analogue of theorem  [ maintheoremsameranks ] holds in the more general case of a legendrian submanifold of @xmath11 whose legendrian contact homology algebra admits an augmentaton .",
    "this question is currently being studied by chantraine , ghiggini and the authors , see @xcite .",
    "murphy in @xcite has proven an h - principle type result for a class of legendrian embeddings in contact manifolds of dimension at least 5 .",
    "these legendrian submanifolds are called loose , see section  [ looselegsect ] for the definition .",
    "in addition , eliashberg and murphy in @xcite have established an h - principle for lagrangian cobordisms with loose negative ends .",
    "we apply the result of eliashberg and murphy and , in contrast to theorem  [ maintheoremsameranks ] , get the following result for a closed , connected genus @xmath119 loose legendrian surface in @xmath120 :    [ anycoblooselegsphere ] for any closed , orientable , connected @xmath121-manifold @xmath122 and any closed , connected loose legendrian surface @xmath123 of genus @xmath119 , there is an exact lagrangian endocobordism @xmath5 of @xmath124 in the symplectization of @xmath125 which is diffeomorphic to @xmath126 .",

    "one can obviously apply the front spinning construction to the examples in section  [ sec : flex ] to produce further examples .",
