    "the discovery that information encoded over quantum systems can exhibit strange and wonderful computational @xcite and information theoretic @xcite properties has led to an explosion of interest in understanding and exploiting the `` quantumness '' of nature . for the use of quantum information to progress beyond mere theoretical constructs into the realm of testable and useful implementations and experiments , it is essential to develop techniques for preserving quantum coherences . in particular",
    ", the coupling of a quantum system to its environment leads to a process known as decoherence , in which encoded quantum information is lost to the environment . in order to remedy this problem active quantum error correction codes ( qeccs ) @xcite have been developed , by analogy with classical error correction .",
    "these codes encode quantum information over an entangled set of codewords , the structure of which serves to preserve the quantum information , when used in conjunction with a frequently recurring error correcting procedure .",
    "it has been shown that when the rate of decoherence is below a certain threshold , fault tolerant quantum information manipulation is possible@xcite . since it is believed that there are no systems for which the decoherence mechanism entirely vanishes , qeccs will be essential if quantum information manipulation is to become practical .",
    "an alternative approach has been proposed and developed recently , in which the central motivation is the desire to reduce the effect of a specific decoherence mechanism .",
    "this is the decoherence - free subspace ( dfs ) approach ( also referred to as `` error avoiding '' , or `` noiseless '' quantum codes ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the active mode of qecc , dfs theory can be viewed as providing a passive approach , where a specific symmetry of the system - bath coupling is employed in order to seek out a quiet corner of the system s hilbert space which does not experience decoherence .",
    "information encoded here over a subspace of ( usually entangled ) system states is robust against a specific form of decoherence .",
    "we shall refer to this as the `` dfs supporting decoherence mechanism '' .",
    "when this is the dominant form of decoherence in the physical system , there are major gains to be had by operating in the dfs .",
    "previous work has shown that collective decoherence of the type experienced in condensed phase systems at low temperatures can be successfully eliminated in this way @xcite .",
    "further research showed that dfss are robust to perturbing error processes @xcite , and are thus ideally suited for concatenation in a qecc @xcite .",
    "the motivating goal behind the dfs approach is to _ use symmetry first_. thus , one first identifies a dfs for the major sources of decoherence , via the symmetry of the interaction with the environment .",
    "one then proceeds to use the dfs states as a basis for a qecc which can deal with additional perturbing error processes . in order for this scheme to be credible",
    ", dfss must support the ability to perform universal quantum computation on the encoded states . towards this end , certain existential results @xcite have been derived showing that in principle universal quantum computation can be performed on any dfs .",
    "constructive results for a set of universal quantum gates on a particular class dfss were subsequently constructed in @xcite using known qecc constructions .",
    "however , these gates were constructed in such a way that during the operation of the gate , states within a dfs are taken outside of this subspace .",
    "thus these gates would necessarily need to operate on a timescale faster than the dfs supporting decoherence mechanism , in order to be applied efficiently to a concatenated dfs - qecc scheme .",
    "similarly , a universal computation result on dfss for atoms in cavities was recently presented by beige _",
    "_ in @xcite .",
    "it assumes that the interaction driving a system out of the dfs is much weaker than the coupling of non df - states to the environment .",
    "it is then possible to make use of an environment - induced quantum zeno effect . in order to make use of the robustness condition _ without _",
    "resorting to gates which can be made faster than the main dfs supporting decoherence mechanism , one would prefer to explicitly construct a set of hamiltonians which can be used to perform universal quantum computation , but which _ never allow states in the dfs to leak out of the dfs_. imperfections in these gates may be dealt with by the concatenation technique of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , one would , from a practical standpoint , like to use hamiltonians which involve at most two - body interactions ( under the assumption that any three - body interactions will be weak and not useful for operations which must compete with the decoherence rate ) . in @xcite",
    "such hamiltonians were used for the important decoherence mechanism known as `` collective decoherence '' , on a system of @xmath0 physical qubits . in collective decoherence",
    "the bath can not distinguish between individual system qubits , and thus couples in a collective manner to the qubits .",
    "the corresponding two - body hamiltonians used to implement universal quantum computation are those that preserve the collective symmetry : the _ exchange interaction _ between pairs of qubits .",
    "the first and main purpose of this paper is therefore to extend the constructive results obtained in @xcite to other forms of collective decoherence and to larger dfss .",
    "two different forms of collective decoherence are considered here , and constructive results are obtained for these on dfss of arbitrary numbers of qubits .",
    "these results have implications that extend far beyond the problem of dealing with collective decoherence . since they imply that the exchange interaction _ by itself _ is sufficient to implement universal quantum computation _ on a subspace _",
    ", it follows that using encoded ( rather than physical ) qubits can be advantageous when resources for physical operations are limited .",
    "after all , the standard results for universal quantum computation employ either arbitrary single - qubit operations in addition to a non - trivial two - qubit gate ( e.g. , a controlled - not ) , or at least two non - commuting two - qubit hamiltonians @xcite . these issues will be explored in a separate publication .",
    "previous work established that dfss correspond to the degenerate component of a qecc @xcite .",
    "a second purpose of this work is to present new results on a recently discovered generalization of dfss , which has been termed `` noiseless subsystems '' , and arises from a theory of qecc for general decoherence mechanisms @xcite . in line with our previously established terminology",
    "@xcite we will refer to these as `` decoherence - free subsystems '' , where we take the term `` decoherence '' to mean both dephasing ( @xmath1 ) and dissipation ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "essentially , the generalization corresponds to allowing for information to be encoded into states transforming according to _ arbitrary_-dimensional irreducible representations ( irreps ) of the decoherence - operators algebra , instead of just one - dimensional irreps as in the decoherence - free subspace case ( we will present precise definitions later in this paper ) .",
    "these results all arise from a basic theorem on algebras that are closed under the hermitian conjugation operation ( `` @xmath3-closed algebras '' ) , and thereby unify the role of symmetry in both decoherence - free subspaces and quantum error correction . in this paper",
    "we extend the decoherence - free subsystem concept to situations governed by essentially non-@xmath3-closed evolution .",
    "such situations arise from non - hermitian terms in the system - bath interaction , which may occur , e.g. , in generalized master equation and conditional hamiltonian representations of open quantum dynamics @xcite . in particular",
    ", we derive an if and only if ( iff ) condition for the existence of decoherence - free subsystems with dynamics governed by a semigroup master equation .",
    "this is important because it is well known in decoherence - free subspace theory that such non-@xmath3-closed evolution can support different dfss than in the @xmath3-closed case . a similar result is now shown here to hold for the decoherence - free subsystems",
    ".    existential results for universal quantum computation on decoherence - free subsystems also exist @xcite .",
    "the universal quantum computation results we obtain in this paper extend beyond decoherence - free subspaces : we show how to achieve _ constructive _ universal quantum computation on the decoherence - free subsystems supported under collective decoherence .",
    "this most significant achievement of our paper settles the question of universal quantum computation under collective decoherence using realistic hamiltonians .",
    "another aim of this paper is to elucidate the close link between dfs and qecc . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that dfss are in fact _ maximally degenerate _ qeccs .",
    "this result was derived from the general condition for a code to be a qecc @xcite .",
    "a very fruitful approach towards qecc has been the stabilizer formalism developed in @xcite which led to the theory of universal fault - tolerant computation on qeccs @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we considered dfss as abelian stabilizer codes .",
    "here we generalize the stabilizer - framework to _ non - abelian _ stabilizers , and show that in general dfss are stabilizer - codes that protect against errors in the stabilizer itself .",
    "this perspective allows in return to view qeccs as dfss against a certain kind of errors , and establishes a kind of _ duality _ of qeccs and dfss .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ chapter1 ] we review decoherence - free subsystems and place them into the context of the markovian master equation . for decoherence - free subspaces this has been done in @xcite .",
    "these earlier results are therefore generalized here to subsystems . in section [ stabichapter ]",
    "we introduce a generalized stabilizer - formalism for dfs , and connect to the theory of stabilizers on qecc developed in @xcite .",
    "this allows us to treat dfs and qecc within the same framework .",
    "it also sheds some light on the _ duality _ between dfs and qecc , in particular on the performance of a dfs viewed as a qecc and _ vice versa_. in section [ universalchapter ] we deal with universal computation on dfs within both the stabilizer - framework and the representation - theoretic approach .",
    "we derive fault - tolerance properties of the universal operations .",
    "in particular , we show how to obtain operations that keep the states _ within _ a dfs during the _ entire switching - time _ of a gate .",
    "further we define the allowed compositions of operations and review results on the length of gate sequences in terms of the desired accuracy of the target gates . in section [ collectivechapter ]",
    "we introduce the model of collective decoherence .",
    "section [ weakchapter ] explicitly deals with the abelian case of _ weak collective decoherence _ in which system - bath interaction coupling involves only a single system operator .",
    "stabilizer and error - correcting properties are developed for this case , and it is shown how universal computation can be achieved .",
    "the same is done for the non - abelian and more general case of _ strong collective decoherence _ in section [ strongchapter ] . for both weak and strong collective decoherence we show how to fault - tolerantly encode into and read out of the respective dfss .",
    "finally , we analyze in section [ concatchapter ] how to concatenate dfss and qeccs to make them more robust against perturbing errors ( as proposed in @xcite ) and show how the universality results can be applied to achieve fault - tolerant universal computation on these powerful concatenated codes .",
    "we conclude in section [ concludechapter ] .",
    "derivations and proofs of a more technical nature are presented in the appendix .",
    "consider the dynamics of a system @xmath4 ( the quantum computer ) coupled to a bath @xmath5 via the hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) [ the system ( bath ) hamiltonian ] acts on the system ( bath ) hilbert space @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the identity operator on the system ( bath ) hilbert space , and @xmath13 , which acts on both the system and bath hilbert spaces @xmath14 , is the interaction hamiltonian containing all the nontrivial couplings between system and bath .",
    "in general @xmath15 can be written as a sum of operators which act separately on the system ( @xmath16 s ) and on the bath ( @xmath17 s ) : @xmath18 in the absence of an interaction hamiltonian ( @xmath19 ) , the evolution of the system and the bath are separately unitary : @xmath20=\\exp [ -i{\\bf h}_{s}t]\\otimes \\exp [ -i{\\bf h}_{b}t]$ ] ( we set @xmath21 throughout ) .",
    "information that has been encoded ( mapped ) into states of the system hilbert space remains encoded in the system hilbert space if @xmath19 .",
    "however in the case when the interaction hamiltonian contains nontrivial couplings between the system and the bath , information that has been encoded over the system hilbert space does not remain encoded over solely the system hilbert space but spreads out instead into the combined system and bath hilbert space as the time evolution proceeds .",
    "such leakage of quantum information from the system to the bath is the origin of the _ decoherence _ process in quantum mechanics .",
    "let @xmath22 be a subspace of the system hilbert space with a basis @xmath23 .",
    "the evolution of such a subspace will be unitary @xcite if and only if ( i ) @xmath24 for all @xmath25 and for all @xmath26 , ( ii ) @xmath7 does not mix states within the subspace with states that are outside of the subspace ( @xmath27 for all @xmath23 in the subspace and all @xmath28 outside of the subspace : @xmath29 ) and ( iii ) system and bath are initially decoupled @xmath30 .",
    "we call a subspace of the system s hilbert space which fulfills these requirements a _ decoherence - free subspace _ _  _ ( dfs )",
    ".    the above formulation of dfss in terms of a larger closed system is exact .",
    "it is extremely useful for finding dfss , providing often the most direct route via simple examination of the system components of the interaction hamiltonian . in practical situations ,",
    "however , the closed - system formulation of dfss is often too strict .",
    "this is because the closed - system formulation incorporates the possibility that information which is put into the bath will back - react on the system and cause a recurrence .",
    "such interactions will always occur in the closed - system formulation ( due to the the hamiltonian being hermitian ) .",
    "however , in many practical situations the likelihood of such an event is extremely small .",
    "thus , for example , an excited atom which is in a `` cold '' bath will radiate a photon and decohere but the bath will not in turn excite the atom back to its excited state , except via the ( extremely long ) recurrence time of the emission process . in these situations a more appropriate way to describe the evolution of the system is via a quantum dynamical semigroup master equation @xcite . by assuming that ( i ) the evolution of system density matrix is a one - parameter semigroup , ( ii ) the system density matrix retains the properties of a density matrix including `` complete positivity '' , and ( iii ) the system and bath density matrices are initially decoupled , lindblad @xcite has shown that the most general evolution of the system density matrix @xmath31 is governed by the master equation @xmath32+{\\tt l } _",

    "an analysis of the properties of dfss with a stabilizer in the pauli - group has been carried out in @xcite .",
    "most of the dfss stemming from physical error - models will not have a stabilizer in the pauli - group , i.e. , they are _ non - additive codes_. the stabilizer may even be infinite . in particular , the codes obtained from a noise model where errors arise from a symmetric coupling of the system to the bath and that form the focus of this paper , are of this type .    as discussed in the previous section , a dfs",

    "more specifically , to perform quantum algorithms on a dfs one has to be able to perform _ universal quantum computation _ using decoherence - free states .",
    "the notion of universal computation is the following : with a restricted set of operations or interactions at hand , one wishes to implement any unitary transformation on the given hilbert space , to an arbitrary degree of accuracy . from a physical implementation perspective",

    "there are essentially two equivalent approaches to identify the `` encoded '' operations that preserve a dfs .",

    "naturally , one would like to do this on the largest dfs . since given the number of qubits @xmath206 the dimensions of the dfss are @xmath490 , the largest dfs is the decoherence - free sub_space _ @xmath491 . in principle",
    "it is possible , by virtue of the independence result , to universally quantum compute _ in parallel _ on all dfss .      to make use of a dfs for encoding information in a quantum computer , in addition to the universal quantum computation described above",
    ", it must also be possible to initially prepare encoded states and to decode the quantum information on the dfs at the end of a computation .",
    "encoding requires that the density matrix of the prepared states should have a large overlap with the dfs .",
    "note that it is _ not _ necessary to prepare states that have support exclusively within the dfs .",
    "this follows from the fact that in our construction , while a computation is performed there is no mixing of states inside and outside of the dfs .",
    "if an initially prepared state is `` contaminated '' ( has some support outside the dfs we want to compute on ) , then the result of the computation will have the same amount of contamination , i.e. , the initial error does not spread .    for example , suppose we can prepare the state @xmath492 where @xmath493 is a state of a particular dfs and @xmath494 is a state outside of this dfs .",
    "then the computation will proceed independently on the dfs and the states outside of the dfs .",
    "readout will then obtain the result of the computation with probability @xmath495 .",
    "repeated application of the quantum computation will give the desired result to arbitrary confidence level .",
    "there are many choices for the initial states of a computation and the decision as to which states to prepare should be guided by the available gates and measurements and the accuracy that is achievable . for",
    "efficient computation one should try to maximize the overlap of the prepared state with the desired initial dfs state .    for the wcd case preparation of initial pure states",
    "is very simple .",
    "suppose we are concerned with the @xmath496 error wcd - dfs .",
    "pure state preparation into such a dfs then corresponds to the ability to prepare a state which has support over states with a specific number of @xmath497 and @xmath498 ( eigenstates of the @xmath335 operator ) .",
    "this is particularly simple if measurements in the @xmath335 basis ( @xmath497 , @xmath498 ) as well as @xmath499 gates ( to `` flip '' the bits ) are available .",
    "the second crucial ingredient for computation on a dfs ( in addition to preparation ) is the decoding or readout of quantum information resulting from a computation .",
    "once again , there are many options for how this can be performed . for example , in the wcd case one can make a measurement which distinguishes all of the dfss and all of the states within this dfs by simply making a measurement in the @xmath335 basis on every qubit .",
    "further , all measurements with a given number of distinct eigenvalues can be performed by first rotating the observable into one corresponding to a measurement in the computational basis ( which , in turn , corresponds to a unitary operation on the dfs ) and then performing the given measurement in the @xmath335 basis , and finally rotating back .",
    "there are other situations where one would like to , say , make a measurement of an observable over the dfs which has only two different eigenvalues .",
    "this type of measurement can be most easily performed by a _ concatenated measurement _ @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "one attaches another dfs to the original dfs , forming a single larger dfs .",
    "then , assuming universal quantum computation over this larger dfs one can always perform operations which allow a measurement of the first dfs by entangling it with the second dfs , and reading out ( destructively as described for the wcd above ) the second dfs .",
    "for example , suppose the first dfs encodes two bits of quantum information , @xmath500 , @xmath501 , and the second dfs encodes a single bit of quantum information @xmath502 , @xmath503 .",
    "then one can make a measurement of the observable @xmath504 on the first dfs by performing an encoded controlled - not operation between the first and the second dfs , and reading out the second dfs in the encoded @xmath335 basis .",
    "for the wcd case the ability to make this destructive measurement on the ancilla ( not on the code ) simply corresponds to the ability to measure single @xmath335 operations .",
    "finally , we note that for a wcd - dfs there is a destructive measurement which distinguishes between different dfss ( corresponding to a measurement of the number of @xmath498 s ) .",
    "one can fault - tolerantly prepare a wcd - dfs state by repeatedly performing such a measurement to guarantee that the state is in the proper dfs .",
    "the concatenated measurement procedures described above for any dfs are naturally fault - tolerant in the sense that they can be repeated and are non - destructive @xcite . thus fault - tolerant preparation and decoding is available for the wcd - dfs .",

    "as above , this action simultaneously affects dfs@xmath716 and dfs@xmath722 .",

    "thus we can obtain @xmath723 on all of the b - states of dfs@xmath716 .",
    "but the exchange operator @xmath671 acts to mix the b - states with the single t - state of dfs@xmath716 .",
    "thus we can construct an @xmath208 algebra between that single - t state and a single b - state in a manner directly analogous to the above proof for @xmath662 .",
    "finally , by the enlarging lemma it follows that we can obtain @xmath717 on dfs@xmath716 .",
    "this concludes the proof that the exchange interaction is universal independently on each of the different strong - collective - decoherence dfss .      at first glance",
    "it might seem difficult to prepare pure states of a scd - dfs , because these states are nontrivially entangled .",
    "however , it is easy to see that every df _ subspace _ contains a state which is a tensor product of singlet states : @xmath724 because these states have zero total angular momentum",
    ". thus a supply of singlet states is sufficient to prepare df subspace states .",
    "further , df _ subsystems",
    "_ always contain a state which is a tensor product of a df subspace and a pure state of the form @xmath725 .",
    "this can be seen from fig .",
    "( [ figure4 ] ) , where the lowest path leading to a specific dfs@xmath686 is composed of a segment passing through a df subspace ( and is thus of the form @xmath726 ) , and a segment going straight up from there to dfs@xmath686 .",
    "the corresponding state is equivalent to adding a spin-@xmath320 ( df subspace ) and a spin-@xmath64 df subsystem ( the @xmath727 state of the latter is seen to be made up entirely of @xmath728 ) . in general , addition of a spin-@xmath320 dfs and",
    "a spin-@xmath64 dfs simply corresponds to tensoring the two states .",
    "note , however , that addition of two arbitrary df subsystems into a larger dfs is not nearly as simple : concatenation of two @xmath729 dfss does _ not _ correspond to tensoring .",
    "pure state preparation for a scd - dfs can thus be as simple as the ability to produce singlet states and @xmath498 states ( it is also possible to use the @xmath730 or any of the other @xmath731 states plus singlets ) .",
    "other , more complicated pure state preparation procedures are also conceivable , and the decision as to which procedure to use is clearly determined by the available resources to manipulate quantum states .",
    "the pure state preparation of singlets and computational basis states has the distinct advantage that verification of these states should be experimentally achievable .",
    "such verification is necessary for fault - tolerant preparation @xcite .",
    "measurements on the scd - dfs can be performed by using the concatenated measurement scheme detailed in the wcd - dfs discussion [ sec .",
    "( [ wcdprep ] ) ] .",
    "in particular , by attaching a scd - df _ subspace _ ancilla via concatenation , one can construct any concatenated measurement scenario .",
    "all that remains to be shown is how to perform a destructive measurement on such an ancilla . in @xcite",
    "such schemes are presented for the @xmath533 scd - df subspace which encodes a single qubit of information .",
    "we will not repeat the details of these schemes here , but note that they involve measurements of single physical - qubit observables and thus are experimentally very reasonable .",
    "further , we note that the ability to perform a concatenated measurement scenario by concatenating an ancilla dfs composed of a single encoded - qubit , can be used to perform any possible concatenated dfs measurement scenario . as mentioned in the wcd case ,",
    "the concatenated measurement procedures are fault - tolerant .",
    "thus we have shown how to perform fault - tolerant preparation and decoding on the scd - dfs .",
    "so far we have shown how to implement universal computation with local hamiltonians on a dfs corresponding to a single block of qubits .",
    "this construction assumes that the only errors are collective .",
    "this is a very stringent symmetry requirement , which obviously becomes less realistic the larger the number of particles @xmath206 is .",
    "it is thus desirable to be able to deal with perturbations that break the collective - decoherence ( permutation)symmetry . to this end",
    "we have previously studied the effect of symmetry - breaking perturbations on decoherence - free subspaces @xcite , and have proposed a concatenation method to make dfss robust in the presence of such perturbations .",
    "this method embeds dfs blocks of four particles ( each block constituting a single encoded qubit ) into a qecc @xcite .",
    "the qecc in the outer layer then takes care of any single encoded - qubit errors on each of its constituent dfs - blocks ; in fact the code can correct for any `` leakage '' error taking a state outside of the dfs , by transforming this into a single encoded qubit error on the qecc . by choosing an appropriate qecc",
    "it is thus possible to deal with any type of non - collective error on the encoded dfs - qubits . in particular , by using the `` perfect '' 5-qubit code @xcite it is possible to correct all independent errors between blocks of four particles .",
    "the problem with this construction so far was , that in order to correct on the outer qecc , it is necessary to perform encoded operations on the constituent dfss in a fault - tolerant way , using ( realistic ) local interactions .",
    "specifically , it is necessary to be able to implement all single encoded - qubit operations on the dfs - qubits of the outer qecc , as well as operations _ between _ two dfs - blocks ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "given that one can perform single qubit ( or `` qupit '' for higher - dimensional dfss ) operations on each dfs - block , the only additional gate necessary to implement error - correction _ and _ universal quantum computation on a concatenated qecc - dfs , is any non - separable two - encoded - qubit gate @xmath732 between any four states in the two dfs - blocks .",
    "for instance , a controlled - phase operation , which gives a phase of @xmath255 to @xmath733 and leaves all other states unchanged .",
    "in fact , it is sufficient to be able to perform this gate @xmath732 between neighboring blocks only @xcite .",
    "the above results give us the tools to perform single dfs - qubit ( or qupit ) operations on a block .",
    "to construct an encoded @xmath732 between two neighboring blocks , we assume that the corresponding physical qubits are spatially close together during the switching time of the gate .",
    "since the symmetry of collective decoherence arises from the spatial correlation of the decoherence process , we can further assume that during this switching time , both dfs - blocks couple to the same bath mode .",
    "this assumption is physically motivated by the expectation that collective decoherence occurs in the analog of the dicke limit of quantum optics , where the qubits have small spatial separations relative to the bath correlation length @xcite .",
    "then the two dfs - clusters temporarily form a bigger dfs and we can use the universal operations we have constructed previously on this big dfs to implement the desired gate @xmath732 .",
    "this makes the concatenated qecc - dfs fully workable as a code supporting universal fault - tolerant quantum computation .",
    "in this paper we have settled the issue of _ quantum computation _ with realistic ( few - body ) means on both decoherence - free subspaces and decoherence - free ( noiseless ) subsystems ( dfss ) for two important forms of decoherence : collective phase damping ( `` weak collective decoherence '' ) , and collective phase damping plus collective dissipation ( `` strong collective decoherence '' ) .",
    "this resolves an outstanding question as to whether universal computation on these physically relevant dfss by using just 1- and 2-body hamiltonians is possible .",
    "the implications of this result for the usefulness of dfss are drastic .",
    "they put the theory of dfss on an equal footing with the theory of quantum error correction , in that the full repertoire of universal fault tolerant quantum computation is now available on dfss for collective decoherence : the most important pertinent decoherence process .",
    "moreover , the strict assumption of collective decoherence can be lifted by allowing for perturbing independent qubit errors . as we proposed earlier",
    "it is possible to stabilize dfss against such errors by concatenation with a quantum error correcting code ( qecc ) .",
    "however , to be able to implement error - correction and fault - tolerant universal computation on these concatenated codes a crucial ( and so far missing ) ingredient was the ability to perform encoded operations on the dfs - blocks fault - tolerantly .",
    "this paper settles that matter , showing constructively that dfss can be made robust .",
    "furthermore , this paper reports on a general framework incorporating both dfss and qeccs , and generalizes the theory of stabilizer codes to the ( non - abelian ) dfs - case .",
    "this framework enabled us to identify the allowed operations on a dfs and to show that these operations can be performed while maintaining a very strong form of fault - tolerance : the states remain within the dfs during the entire switching time of the gate .",
    "our formalism should be readily applicable for other non - additive codes .",
    "there is an interesting duality between qeccs which are designed to correct single ( or greater ) qubit errors and dfss . in qecc",
    "the errors are all single body interactions .",
    "the qecc condition therefore implies that any one or two - body hamiltonian must take codewords outside of the code space because these interactions themselves look like errors .",
    "qeccs must leave their codespace in order to perform quantum computation on the encoded operations .",
    "this means that qeccs must have gates which act much faster than the decoherence mechanism so that a perturbative treatment can be carried out .",
    "qecc can correct small errors but the price paid for this is that gates must be executed quickly ( not to mention that fault - tolerant gates must also be used ) .",
    "dfss on the other hand , do not have the requirement of correcting single qubit errors and we have found that a single two - body interaction ( exchange ) is sufficient to generate universal quantum computation fault - tolerantly .",
    "dfss have larger errors but this allows for an economy of hamiltonians .    as corollaries to our results on weak and strong collective decoherence two additional properties of the corresponding dfs encodings",
    "appear :    * * one can work on all dfss in parallel : * since we are able to implement @xmath734 on each dfs@xmath303 ( @xmath206=number of particles ) _ independently _ , we can in principle work on all dfss in parallel .",
    "this means that we can encode quantum information into each of the dfss and perform calculations ( possibly different ) on all of them _ at once_. * * for the strong collective decoherence case the exchange gate is asymptotically universal : * it is well known that the encoding efficiency of the singlet space of the strong collective decoherence - dfs for large @xmath206 approaches unity @xcite .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath552 be the number of _ encoded _ qubits in the singlet ( @xmath577 ) sector of a hilbert space of @xmath206 qubits , then @xmath735 we have established that the exchange gate alone ( with an irrational phase ) implements universal computation on each dfs and on the singlet space in particular .",
    "thus , we find that , for large @xmath206 , in order to achieve universal computation with nearly perfect efficiency , all we need to be able to perform is the exchange interaction .",
    "this result is very promising from an experimental point of view , since the exchange interaction is prevalent whenever there is a heisenberg coupling between systems @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that regardless of the decoherence mechanism , this implies that universal quantum computation can be achieved `` asymptotically '' using a _ single _",
    "gate @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that there are many more such two - body interactions which similarly provide such `` asymptotic universality '' _ on their own_.",
