    "the interest in theoretical studies of transport phenomena in 2d electron systems has raised substantially after the discovery @xcite of oscillations of the diagonal components of the conductivity tensor in `` ultraclean '' gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as samples in the classical interval of the magnetic field intensity , where the shubnikov  de haas ( sdh ) oscillations do nt manifest themselves .",
    "together with the oscillations of the diagonal components of the conductivity tensor caused by absorption by charge carriers of the energy of the microwave radiation field and transitions between landau levels , `` beats '' have been found experimentally @xcite in the interval of more weak magnetic fields .",
    "such beats are usually related with the manifestations of the interaction between kinetic and spin degrees of freedom of the conductivity electrons .",
    "such interaction is the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) that is known to be the origin of numerous effects in transport phenomena observed in such systems . among them",
    "there are , e.g. , beats in sdh oscillations @xcite , spin accumulation @xcite , magneto - electric effect @xcite , etc .",
    "soi also leads to the possibility of electron transitions between landau levels in the magnetic field at the combined resonance frequencies @xcite , thus transitions being possible both in antinodes of electric and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "finally , operation of a spin transistor ( schemes of which have been considered in @xcite ) is based upon spin degrees of freedom .",
    "all of the above has determined elevated interest to investigations of the soi in 2d semiconductor structures .    for the purpose of studying the soi",
    ", it appears interesting to investigate a model in which the role of the soi should manifest itself the strongest . since the soi depends upon both translational and spin degrees of freedom , then it is a channel over which energy ( both electric and magnetic ) can be absorbed from the ultra - high frequency field , thus causing transitions between landau levels . because of that , it is interesting to investigate the response of a non - equilibrium electron system to a dc weak ( `` measurement '' ) electric field for the case when the initial non - equilibrium state is created with a high - frequency ac magnetic field that leads to combined transitions .",
    "the question is how this perturbation affects transport coefficients , in particular , the conductivity tensor .",
    "the discussed model includes the contributions fom landau quantization and ( in th long - wavelength limit ) from the microwave radiation exactly , without use of the perturbation theory .",
    "we consider impurity centers for the role of scatterers , treating the scattering process perturbatively .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system under consideration is : @xmath2 here @xmath3 and @xmath4 are kinetic and zeeman energies , respectively , in the magnetic field @xmath5 : @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 are operators of the components of the spin and kinetic momentum of the @xmath9th electron , where @xmath10 = -\\delta_{ij } i m \\hbar\\omega_c\\varepsilon_{\\alpha\\beta z}$ ] , @xmath11 is the cyclotron frequency , and @xmath12 is bohr magneton .",

    "@xmath21 is the interaction between translational and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "its most general form is : @xmath22 here @xmath23 is a pseudo - vector , components of which can be represented as a form of order @xmath24 in the components of the kinetic momentum @xmath25 .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction leads to correlation of spatial and spin motion of electrons , thus , the translational and spin - related subsystems are not well - defined . since the soi is in some sense small , then one can perform a momentum - dependent canonical transformation that decouples kinetic and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "naturally , all other terms in the hamiltonian , describing the interaction of electrons with the lattice and external fields ( if any ) also undergo the transformation . in this case",
    ", the effective interaction of electrons in the system with external fields appears , which leads to resonant absorption of the field energy not only at the frequency of the paramagnetic resonance @xmath26 or cyclotron resonance @xmath27 , but also at their linear combinations , i.e. the combined resonance .",
    "the gauge - invariant theory of the combined resonance has been developed in @xcite .",
    "assuming the soi to be small , we perform the canonical transformation of the hamiltonian . up to the terms linear in @xmath28 , we have : @xmath29.\\ ] ] the operator of the canonical transformation @xmath30 has to be determined from the requirement that , after the transformation , the @xmath31 and @xmath24 subsystems become independent .",
    "this requirement can be written as the following condition : @xmath32=0.\\ ] ] note that , after the canonical transformation , the @xmath33 and @xmath4 operators are the integrals of motion if @xmath34 and there is no interaction with external fields .",
    "we assume the specific form of the soi term , namely , rashba interaction , which is non - zero even in the linear order in momentum : @xmath35 @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the constant characterizing the soi , @xmath38 is the fully - antisymmetric levi ",

    "( [ 6 ] ) and integrating , we obtain : @xmath39 obviously , the criteria for the applicability of this theory is that , for characteristic values of the electron momentum @xmath40 , the inequality @xmath41 should hold .",

    "besides that , we limit the consideration to the case when the dc and ac magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other : @xmath55 . in this case , the effective interaction responsible for the combined transitions has the following form : @xmath56= \\\\=\\frac{i \\alpha \\omega_{1 s}}{2\\hbar(\\omega_c-\\omega_s ) } \\,\\sum_j s_j^z ( \\,p_j^+ e^{-i\\omega t}-p_j^- e^{i\\omega t}\\,).\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 is the intensity of the circularly polarized magnetic field , rotating with the frequency @xmath59 .",
    "the dependence of the effective interaction @xmath60 upon time causes certain difficulties while calculating the non - equilibrium response of the electron system to the measurement electric field .",
    "thus , it is expedient to carry out one more canonical transformation ( appendix a ) , that removes the interaction @xmath60 and renormalizes the electron - impurity interaction hamiltonian ( appendix b ) , which acquires the time dependence then . in the canonically transformed system",
    ", impurities act as a coherent oscillating field that leads to resonant transitions .",
    "we assume that the initial non - equilibrium state of the system under consideration is created by the ultra - high frequency magnetic field and can be described with the distribution @xmath61 . obviously , if some additional perturbation acts upon the system , then a new non - equilibrium state is formed in the system , that requires an extended set of basis operators for its description .",
