    "dynamical approach_.  @xcite hole transfer experiments  @xcite had already hinted at the strong influence of dna structural fluctuations in supporting or hindering charge propagation .",
    "hence , it seems natural to expect that dynamical effects would also play a determining role in charge transport processes for molecules contacted by electrodes . a realistic inclusion of the influence of dynamical effects onto the transport properties can however only be achieved via hybrid methodologies combining a reliable description of the biomolecular dynamics and electronic structure with quantum transport calculations .",

    "calculations for static biomoecular structures can provide a very valuable starting point for the parametrization of model hamiltonians ;  @xcite however , a full first - principle treatment of both dynamics and electronic structure lies outside the capabilities of state - of - the - art methodologies .    in this paper , we will ellaborate on a recent study on homogeneous dna sequences  @xcite by addressing in detail some methodological issues .",
    "our focus will be on the so called dickerson dodecamer  @xcite with the sequence @xmath0gcgcttaacggc@xmath1 and for which the effect of the dynamical fluctuations becomes very clear .",
    "our approach combines classical molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations with electronic structure calculations to provide a realistic starting point for the description of the influence of structural fluctuations onto the electronic structure of a biomolecule .",

    "a central point is the use of the concept of fragment orbitals  @xcite which allows for a very efficient and flexible mapping of the electronic structure of a complex system onto a much simpler effective model .",

    "we stress that in contrast to other models which explicitly contain the coupling to vibrational excitations or to an environment  @xcite at the price of introducing several free parameters , our methodology potentially contains the full dynamical complexity of the biomolecule as obtained from the md simulations .",
    "one main advantage of our approach is the possibilty to progressively improve the degree of coarse - graining by an appropriate re - definition of the molecular fragments .",

    "the core of our method is based on a combination of a charge self - consistent density - functional parametrized tight - binding approach ( scc - dftb ) and the fragment orbital concept ; @xcite both are used to compute the electronic parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 for the effective tight binding model introduced in eq .",

    "@xcite the fourier transform of the onsite energies auto - correlation function provides information about the spectral ranges which are more strongly contributing to the fluctuations of the electronic parameters , see also the next sections .",
    "thus , we have found that the apparently most important modes are located around 1600 @xmath23 corresponding to a base skeleton mode , and at 800 @xmath24 related to the water modes .",

    "this is a more complex task which has been addressed , in the context of exciton transport  @xcite but also to some degree in electron transfer theories .",
    "@xcite here , we adopt a different point of view and formulate a model hamiltonian , where the relevant electronic system , in this case the fragment orbital - derived effective dna electronic system , is coupled explicitly to a bosonic bath .",
    "the latter will encode through its spectral density the dynamical information drawn from the md simulations on internal base dynamics as well as solvent fluctuations .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written in the following way : @xmath26 the time averages ( over the corresponding time series ) of the electronic parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 have been split off to provide a zero - order hamiltonian which contains dynamical effects in a mean - field - like level .",
    "the effect of the fluctuations around these averages is hidden in the vibrational bath , which is assumed to be a collection of a large ( @xmath29 ) number of harmonic oscillators in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath30 .",
    "the bath will be characterized by a spectral density @xmath31 which can also be extracted from the md simulations , as shown below and in ref .",
    "since we are interested in calculating the electrical response of the system , the charge - bath model has to also include the coupling of the system to electronic reservoirs ( electrodes ) .",
    "the coupling to the electrodes will be treated in a standard way , using a tunneling hamiltonian @xmath32 which describes the coupling to the @xmath33-lead with @xmath33= left ( l ) or right ( r ) .",
    "later on , the so called wide - band limit will be introduced ( the corresponding electrode self - energies are purely imaginary and energy - independent ) , thus reducing the electrode - dna coupling to a single parameter .",
    "the previous model relies on some basic assumptions that can be substantiated by the results of the md simulations :  @xcite ( i ) the complex dna dynamics can be well mimic within the harmonic approximation by using a continuous vibrational spectrum ; ( ii ) the simulations show that the local onsite energy fluctuations are much stronger in presence of a solvent than those of the electronic hopping integrals ( see also the end of the previous section ) , so that we assume that the bath is coupled only diagonally to the charge density fluctuations ; ( iii ) fluctuations on different sites display rather similar statistical properties , so that the charge - bath coupling @xmath34 is taken to be independent of the site @xmath35 .",
    "this latter approximation can be lifted by introducing additional site - nonlocal spectral densities @xmath36 ; this however would make the theory more involved and less transparent . in fig .",

    "the fits become obviously less accurate at long times due to the reduced number of sampled data points with increasing time ( the oscillatory behavior becomes stronger ) . from the figure",
    "we first see that the off - diagonal correlations decay on a much shorter time scale as the local ones , so that on a first approximation their neglection can be justified ; further the decay of the correlations for the vacuum simulations is considerably much faster than in a solvent indicating the strong influence of the latter in gating the electronic structure of the biomolecule .",
