    "link smearing is a popular method in lattice qcd , and is simple to combine with any fermion action .",
    "certain smearing types are differentiable , _",
    "e.g. _ stout @xcite and hex @xcite , and can therefore be used in the calculation of the fermionic force term in hybrid monte carlo . for staggered fermions ,",
    "smearing has been motivated as suppressing taste breaking by reducing gluon exchanges of momenta @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "smearing improves the behaviour of lattice perturbation theory by making the tadpole contribution vanishingly small @xcite .",
    "smearing with wilson fermions has been very successful in reducing chiral symmetry breaking errors by suppressing dislocations that lead to eigenvalues below @xmath1 of @xmath2 , ( @xmath3 is the hermitian wilson - dirac operator @xmath4 with @xmath5 the wilson - dirac operator and @xmath6 the quark mass ) , @xcite .",
    "this allows smaller masses to be simulated on coarser lattices without exceptional configurations .",
    "small eigenvalues of @xmath7 is a large negative mass term called the domain - wall height ] are responsible for residual chiral symmetry breaking in domain wall fermions at finite @xmath8 , the size of the fifth dimension @xcite .",
    "this manifests itself in simulations as the residual mass @xmath9 . by reducing the number of modes in the region where the domain wall fermion s ` @xmath10 ' approximation to the sign function is most inaccurate it",
    "is hoped that one could obtain small @xmath9 without increasing @xmath8 .    by suppressing the low modes we are simultaneously improving the condition number of the dirac operator .",
    "thus smearing should also help by speeding up matrix inversions , as has already been observed for the overlap operator @xcite .",
    "one might worry that decoupling the fermion sector from the qcd gluodynamics at a scale below the lattice cut off might carry some penalty , and it is prudent to carefully check the effects of this .",
    "for some time it has been known that quantities like the static potential at short distances @xcite are strongly distorted by smearing . in the case of the static potential",
    "the distortion occurs for distances @xmath11 with @xmath12 , where lattice artefacts are large anyway .",
    "it is also known that link smearing drives the renormalization constants towards their tree level values@xcite .    the rome - southampton method for non - perturbative renormalization ( npr )",
    "@xcite is widely used .",
    "steady improvements to the original method : momentum sources @xcite , non - exceptional momenta @xcite and twisted boundary conditions @xcite , have led to a precise method for renormalizing in lattice calculations ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "the remaining systematic error is dominated by a perturbative matching between the intermediate scheme , such as the ri / mom , and the @xmath13 scheme , which is done at a scale accessible by current lattice calculations .",
    "the perturbative conversion error can be reduced by increasing the matching scale .",
    "the available lattice momentum scale , @xmath14 , can be of the order @xmath15 to @xmath16 which is high enough to reduce the matching error significantly .",
    "a method has been developed @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that uses multiple lattices to stay below the lattice cut - off at all stages of the calculation and calculate non - perturbative renormalization constants at high energies where the effects of low energy qcd are minimised and perturbation theory gives a good description of the running , which should make it possible to reduce the error even further in the future .",
    "link smearing and non - perturbative renormalization have often been used together to predict quantities of great phenomenological importance , _",
    "e.g. _ in recent calculations of the kaon bag parameter @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "rome - southampton vertex functions may also be a case where the short distance properties are of crucial importance , especially since momentum scales close to the lattice cut - off are important . in this paper",
    "we perform a systematic study of the effects of smearing on the high momentum behaviour of npr vertex functions and compare to the unsmeared `` thin link '' case .",
    "the continuum limit is taken at all stages assuming an @xmath18 scaling violation and results are compared in the continuum limit where universality should be satisfied .",
    "we aim to check how link smearing would affect the program of rome - southampton renormalization that has been used for kaon physics simulations in the rbc / ukqcd collaboration .",
    "the results should be of interest for non - perturbative renormalization with any action since we will extrapolate smeared and unsmeared data to the continuum . the crucial point in all that follows",
    "is that the continuum limit results should be independent of the details of the intermediate lattice calculations , in particular if smeared links have been used or not .",
    "in section [ sec : fq ] we calculate the smearing form factor and the associated smearing radius non - perturbatively .",
    "section [ sec : rrlmethods ] describes our method of computing step scaling functions and anomalous dimensions from npr vertex functions and extrapolating to vanishing lattice spacing .",
    "the calculation of anomalous dimensions in a rome - southampton scheme is a new method introduced in this paper .",
    "section [ sec : results ] shows npr vertex functions calculated using different smearing prescriptions , and derives step scaling functions and anomalous dimensions from them .",
    "finally we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] and comment on the use of smeared links together with rome - southampton renormalization .    in this work we have not generated gauge fields using a smeared action ; in order for direct comparison we calculate the relevant vertex functions on the same gauge ensembles with different smearing parameters . for the gauge ensembles we use those of the rbc / ukqcd collaboration ,",
    "they are generated using the iwasaki gauge action and thin - link domain - wall fermions at lattice spacings @xmath19 on a @xmath20 volume and @xmath21 on a @xmath22 volume , that we refer to as the coarse and fine lattices respectively .",
    "the bare quark masses available on the coarse lattice are @xmath23 with @xmath24 and on the fine lattice @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "the effect of smearing on the lattice feynman rules is to introduce a form factor in the quark - gluon vertex @xcite . after applying @xmath27 steps of smearing to obtain the gauge link @xmath28",
    "we can define a gauge field through @xmath29 at leading order , the smeared and unsmeared gauge fields are related by , @xmath30 with the momentum space the form factor @xmath31 , @xmath32 @xmath33 . applying the smearing transformation @xmath27 times",
    "changes @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "the form factor @xmath36 is @xcite , @xmath37^n\\ ] ] for ape smearing with parameter @xmath38 in @xmath39 dimensions .",
    "stout has the same form . for hyp and hex @xmath40",
    "should be replaced by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 to lowest order in @xmath43 . for small @xmath43 we can write the term in brackets as an exponential @xmath44 and identify the mean square radius , @xmath45 as a measure of the space - time region affected by the smearing transformation , in most practical simulations this radius is of the order one .",
    "this new distance scale introduced by smearing could alter the high energy behaviour of the theory .",
    "in particular , since npr directly probes radiative loop corrections it may be highly sensitive to this new scale .",
    "we fix the gauge fields to the landau gauge and then smear them using different smearing types : stout , hyp and hex .",
    "hyp smearing is described in @xcite and hex in @xcite .",
    "both use the same hypercubic blocking transformation but hex uses the stout projection to @xmath46 and hyp uses the ape projection .",
    "hyp and hex smearing require the specification of three parameters , @xmath47 which we choose as @xmath48 for hyp ( this is sometimes called hyp-1 ) and @xmath49 for hex . we show results using one and two hits of hyp smearing and two hits of hex smearing .",
    "we also show three hits of stout with parameter @xmath50 , using the convention of @xcite . using appendix a of @xcite",
    "we can therefore calculate the tree level values of @xmath51 , which we give in the first row of table [ tab : effective_r ] .",
    "the values in this table are small , indicating the effect of smearing hardly extends beyond one lattice spacing .",
    "it is possible to calculate the quantity @xmath36 defined in equation ( [ eqn : fqdef ] ) non - perturbatively as follows . due to the landau gauge fixing",
    ", the equation @xmath52 holds to high precision . from equation ( [ eqn : hdef ] )",
    "this means , @xmath53 and hence @xmath54}{\\textrm{tr}[a^{(0)}_\\mu(q ) a^{(0)}_\\mu(-q ) ] } \\right)^{1/2}.\\ ] ] the lattice gluon field is defined by , @xmath55 \\\\   - \\frac{1}{n_c}\\textrm{tr}\\left [ u_\\mu(x + a \\hat{\\mu}/2 ) - u^\\dagger_\\mu(x + a \\hat{\\mu}/2 ) \\right ] i_{n_c \\times n_c } \\bigr),\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and in momentum space by , @xmath56     +   +     +   +    this can be used in equation ( [ eqn : deffq ] ) and @xmath57 calculated for different levels of smearing . in the left column of figures [ fig : fq_plotsa ] and [ fig :",
    "fq_plotsb ] , ( a cylinder cut in momentum space @xcite of width @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the spatial lattice index , has been used ) are the ` weak field ' results .",
    "this is introduced to check the analysis against perturbation theory .",
    "namely , we multiply every gauge field @xmath60 by @xmath61 , generate @xmath62 by exact exponentiation and then apply the smearing . for this artificially produced weak field we find good agreement with the perturbative expectation , as shown in the left column of figures [ fig : fq_plotsa ] and [ fig : fq_plotsb ] .",
    "the ` full field ' results , using the original , unreduced @xmath62 , are shown on the right .    the identification of the quantity @xmath63 as an effective smearing radius assumes a gaussian profile for @xmath36 . from the plots of @xmath36",
    "it is clear that it is not gaussian and fitting the curves with a gaussian fails .",
    "we attempt to extract a value of @xmath51 in two ways : ( a ) using the point where @xmath36 is equal to @xmath64 of its initial value to define a scale , @xmath65 ( b ) assuming that the functional form of @xmath36 is the same as at tree level , @xmath66 and fitting to a quadratic , then obtaining @xmath51 from the linear co - efficient .",
    "the results of both of these strategies are given in table [ tab : effective_r ] .",
    "these results are far from the perturbative picture , giving significantly smaller radii . in order to make the identification of the perturbative function @xmath36 in equation ( [ eqn : hdef ] ) with equation ( [ eqn : deffq ] ) we assume that equation ( [ eqn : smdef ] ) is valid .",
    "however this is only the case up to leading order in @xmath67 , the smeared gauge fields do not even satisfy the landau condition .",
    "our calculation of @xmath36 is the first time this has been measured non - perturbatively and gives unexpectedly small smearing radii .    having seen how smearing affects the high momentum part of the gauge field we turn to the main focus of this paper : how smearing affects npr at high scales .",
    ".effective smearing radius in lattice units measured using equation ( [ eqn : expdef ] ) ; ( exp ) and equation ( [ eqn : fitdef ] ) ; ( fit ) .",
    "the disagreement between the two definitions arises because the curves are not really gaussian . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    the plots in figure [ fig : zgammacomp ] show the anomalous dimensions for the quark mass , field , the tensor and @xmath17 renormalization . in all cases a similar story is observed . up to some low scale",
    "the continuum limits all agree , as required for a universal continuum limit .",
    "however , upon going higher they disagree indicating lattice artefacts beyond @xmath18 . from the anomalous dimension plots the unsmeared data seems to follow the perturbative prediction more closely .",
    "the principle observation is that an @xmath18 extrapolation will not restore agreement between smeared and unsmeared data when it includes lattice momenta that are sufficiently high to resolve the smearing radius .",
    "naturally , if a sufficiently fine lattice were used at a fixed physical momentum universality would be restored .",
    "the inverse lattice spacing for the coarse lattice is approximately @xmath68 @xcite which is about the scale at which the difference between the stout and unsmeared cases begins to emerge .",
    "the stronger smearing , hex , begins to disagree sooner although the exact scale at which there is a disagreement depends on the operator .",
    "the implication of our data is that the upper end of the rome southampton window is being lowered by the smearing .",
    "the smearing introduces a new scale into the problem , lower than the original lattice cut - off , and extrapolating at scales above that with a low order @xmath69 ansatz will yield incorrect results .    comparing the anomalous dimensions it seems that the unsmeared data is asymptotically approaching perturbation theory , and is quite close already in the range of momenta we have used .",
    "the smeared data agrees with the unsmeared up to a certain scale , as required for a universal continuum limit , but disagrees for larger momenta within the range of our data .",
    "the unsmeared data also overshoots the perturbative anomalous dimension , and does not appear to be asymptotically joining the curve .",
    "this is almost certainly the result of a pinched rome - southampton window introducing lattice artefacts not described by our @xmath18 extrapolation .",
    "were sufficiently fine lattices used with these physical scales we expect that the smeared data would then approach the unsmeared and asymptotically approach the perturbative curve .",
    "this implies that there is a highest lattice momentum we can use for npr which depends on the smearing type and is lower for larger smearing radii .",
    "although strictly speaking we do not know that the unsmeared calculation is lattice artefact free at all scales considered , we can use this as a comparison point and look at the scale at which the smeared and unsmeared begin to disagree , this also depends on the operator and the size of the errors so that being quantitative is difficult . at most we can say with confidence that this scale is lower than about 2 gev in physical units and smaller for 2 hex than 3 stout with our combination of @xmath70 and @xmath71 gev lattice spacings .    smearing the gauge fields",
    "has a significant cost benefit for wilson and chiral fermions , and is becoming ubiquitous in lattice calculations .",
    "however when combined with non - perturbative renormalization there are some pitfalls .",
    "we can illustrate this by considering how large an error would have been introduced by using smeared link step scaling functions in place of thin link for a recent rbc - ukqcd calculation .",
    "step scaling functions , computed on the lattices we have used for this work , have been used by rbc / ukqcd to raise the renormalization scale in previous work , @xcite . in this paper a coarse lattice spacing was used @xmath72 meaning that for npr only low scales were safely accessible . however using two finer lattices step scaling functions were produced to raise the renormalization scale up to @xmath15 thereby reducing the perturbative conversion error significantly .",
    "the @xmath72 lattice in this paper used a different action than the lattices used to calculate the step scaling functions however universality of the continuum limit was used to argue that combining two separate continuum limits introduced errors of @xmath73 .",
    "the step scaling function for the mass calculated in reference @xcite was @xmath74 , see table xvii in this work , reproduced within errors here in table [ tab : ssvals ] , ( we used different configurations and a different fitting procedure compared to @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath13 quark masses calculated in @xcite were @xmath75 using @xmath76 and @xmath77 would change the quark masses significantly more than the indicated error : @xmath78 @xmath79 now that calculations of key parameters such as quark masses and @xmath17 have become so precise the effect of smearing on npr can be a dominant systematic error if not properly controlled .",
    "proper control appears to require keeping the lattice momenta @xmath80 for all vertex functions included in the renormalisation due to the pinched rome - southampton window , while we found that unsmeared data can make use of somewhat larger lattice momenta .",
    "we also found that the effects of stout smearing ( at 2.5% ) were much smaller than the effects of hex smearing ( at 10% ) .",
    "both of these could have been avoided with more conservative lattice momenta , but this would have prevented the successful connection with perturbation theory at 3 gev .",
    "the observed trends in the reduced anomalous dimension at high energy as well as the flattening of the step scaling functions and the renormalization constants moving closer to one are a strong indication , though not a proof , that smearing reduces the effective lattice cut - off .",
    "we note that the effect of reduced perturbative corrections has been loosely described as showing that smearing gauge fields brings the theory closer to the continuum limit . in this paper",
    "we have presented clear evidence based on smeared fermionic vertex functions that such gauge fields possess a second , hidden , coarse lattice spacing associated with the smearing radius , and introduce a narrower rome - southampton scaling window . in light of the removal of the uv content of the gauge field , and the results of this paper , we find it is perhaps more accurate to describe smeared gauge fields as closer to the trivial configuration in a momentum region where qcd has real dynamics to describe , particularly if we seek to run , non - perturbatively , into the perturbative regime to connect to perturbation theory .",
    "renormalizing at lower scales is not a problem in principle for lattice calculations .",
    "a problem arises when performing a perturbative conversion to the @xmath13 scheme .",
    "the perturbative expansions do not converge very well at low energy and raising the scale by even @xmath81 can dramatically reduce the perturbative systematic error .",
    "however , this is expensive to do by brute force . as such",
    ", combining rome - southampton renormalization at low scales with some safe , non - perturbative running to high scales before converting may be necessary for high precision calculations of renormalization constants on smeared backgrounds .",
    "if future ensembles are generated using smeared links then step scaling functions @xcite may be useful for reducing systematic errors in renormalization calculations by allowing us to always operate within a safe momentum range .",
