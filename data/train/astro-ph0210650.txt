    "the lmc cluster reticulum presents several interesting features , such as low - reddening ( e(b - v ) = 0.03 @xmath2 0.02 ) , low - central density ( @xmath1 ) , accurate metallicity estimates ( [ fe / h ] = -1.71 @xmath2 0.09 ) , and a sizable sample of rr lyrae stars ( walker , 1992 ) .",
    "moreover and even more importantly it is marginally affected by field contamination since it is located at approximately 11@xmath3 from the lmc bar ( l = 269@xmath3 , b=-40@xmath3 ) . in spite of these undisputable advantages",
    "only a few investigations have been devoted to this cluster .",
    "in fact , after the pioneering work by gratton & ortolani ( 1987 ) accurate photometry for both the rr lyrae and the bright static stars was provided by walker ( 1992 ) . in this paper",
    "we present some preliminary results concerning the reticulum stellar content well below the turn - off ( to ) region .",
    "data plotted in the figure show quite clearly that this cluster shares the same evolutionary features of old lmc clusters ( olsen et al . , 1998 ) . in this context",
    "it is worth mentioning the sizable sample of bss we detected .",
    "they can be easily identified in the v , b - v and in the u , u - v diagram .",
    "thanks to the accuracy of current data it seems that they can be split into a hotter and a cooler group .",
    "the former one is located at @xmath4 and @xmath5 while the latter at @xmath4 and @xmath6 mag .",
    "finally we note that bss in the u , u - b diagram appear , as expected , cooler than sub giant branch stars .",
