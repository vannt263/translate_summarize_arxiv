    "supernova ( sn ) 1987a , the brightest supernova observed since 1604 , occurred in the milky way s satellite galaxy , the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "the identification of a blue supergiant ( sanduleak @xmath069@xmath13202 , a b3 i star ) as the massive progenitor star @xcite and the detection of the accompanying neutrino burst @xcite indicated that sn 1987a was a type ii core - collapse explosion . a dramatic brightening ( up to three orders of magnitude ) over the entire electromagnetic spectrum was expected to begin @xmath215 yr after the sn explosion as the shock enters the dense , non - spherically symmetric circumstellar medium ( csm ) , the so - called `` inner ring '' , which was produced by the stellar winds from the red supergiant and the blue supergiant phases of the massive progenitor star and then was photoinonized by the uv flash from the sn explosion @xcite . at an age of @xmath216 yr ( as of 2002",
    "december ) , optical and x - ray observations clearly show that this event has begun @xcite , signaling the transition of sn 1987a into a supernova remnant ( snr ) .",
    "sn / snr 1987a is an extremely dynamic object , as the fast blast wave shock ( @xmath14 @xmath2 4000 km s@xmath6 ) begins to heat the inner ring .",
    "this remarkable event is the first - ever observation of the `` birth '' of a supernova remnant .    in the early phases of snrs , x - ray observations provide effective shock diagnostics such as the electron / ion temperatures , ionization state , electron density , and ism abundances , as well as useful information on the sn nucleosynthesis . with its unprecedented high angular resolution of @xmath20@xmath155 in x - rays and its moderate spectral resolution ( e.g. , @xmath16 @xmath2 8 at @xmath17 = 1 kev for the s3 chip ) , the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; garmire et al . 2003 ) on board the _ chandra x - ray observatory _",
    "@xcite is uniquely suited to monitor the rapid morphological and spectral evolution ( on the time - scale of months ) of the x - ray remnant of sn 1987a .",
    "we have been monitoring snr 1987a with the _",
    "chandra_/acis since 1999 october . as of 2002 december",
    ", we have performed a total of seven observations ( table  [ tbl : tab1 ] ) .",
    "results from the first six observations have been reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "the sub - arcsecond angular resolution of the _ chandra_/acis resolved the ring - like x - ray morphology of snr 1987a , which was interpreted as x - ray emission from the heated ism between the forward blast wave and the reverse shock @xcite .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness was higher in the eastern side , probably due to an asymmetric sn explosion , although the origin of such an asymmetric explosion is uncertain .",
    "we detected x - ray - bright spots in the northeastern and the southeastern portions of the x - ray remnant @xcite .",
    "the locations of these x - ray spots were roughly coincident with the optically - bright spots",
    ". the optical bright spots trace where the blast wave shock front cools down and becomes radiative as it encounters dense inward protrusions of the inner ring @xcite . in this model , decelerated , yet non - radiative shocks near the protrusions may also produce soft x - ray emission . the soft x - ray spots positionally coincident with the optical spots were thus consistent with the standard model of the blast wave / inner ring interaction .",
    "on the other hand , the fast shock propagating into the tenuous hii region appeared to produce hard x - ray and radio emission with a smoother distribution of surface brightness than those of the soft x - ray and optically bright spots @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectrum was thermal in origin , dominated by line emission from the highly ionized elemental species o , ne , mg and si @xcite . the x - ray emitting plasma",
    "was described with a plane - parallel shock in non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) state with an electron temperature of @xmath7 @xmath2 3 kev . a blast wave shock velocity of @xmath14 @xmath2 3500 km s@xmath6 was derived from the doppler broadening of the detected x - ray line profiles , which indicated an ion temperature of @xmath7 @xmath2 17 kev @xcite .",
    "this large difference between measured electron and ion temperatures was direct observational evidence for electron - ion non - equilibrium behind the shock in this early phase of the snr .",
    "the observed x - ray flux was increasing non - linearly as the blast wave approached the dense inner ring @xcite .",
    "the lightcurve was steepening , which indicated the beginning of the predicted dramatic brightening of the snr @xcite . despite the identification of a core - collapse sn explosion for sn 1987a",
    ", no direct evidence for the detection of the associated neutron star has been reported .",
    "only upper limits on the x - ray luminosity for the embedded pointlike source have been estimated @xcite .",
    "we here report on results from the latest _",
    "_ observations of snr 1987a .",
    "the seven _ chandra _ observations of snr 1987a are presented in table  [ tbl : tab1 ] .",
    "we first screened all data sets with the flight timeline filter and turned off the pixel randomization for the highest possible angular resolution .",
    "we then corrected the spatial and spectral degradation of the acis data caused by radiation damage , known as the charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ; townsley et al .",
    "2000 ) , with the methods developed by townsley et al .",
    "( 2002a ) , before further standard data screening by status , grade , and energy selections .",
    "the expected effects of the cti correction include an increase of the number of detected events and improved event energies and energy resolution @xcite . `` flaring '' pixels were removed and _ asca _ grades ( 02346 ) were selected .",
    "photons between 0.3 kev and 8.0 kev were extracted for the data analysis .",
    "lightcurves around the source region were examined for possible contamination from variable background emission and no severe variability was found .",
    "the pileup fraction was relatively small ( @xmath1810% ) and thus was ignored in the analysis .",
    "we then applied the `` sub - pixel resolution '' method @xcite to improve the angular resolution of the images to better than the ccd pixel size .",
    "a typical improvement in the angular resolution by @xmath210% is expected from this method @xcite .",
    "the angular size of snr 1987a is small ( the inner ring is only about 1@xmath156 across ; e.g. , burrows et al .",
    "1995 ; jakobsen et al .",
    "1991 ) , and the acis detector pixel size ( 0@xmath15492 ) is not adequate to fully resolve the remnant . in order to further improve the effective angular resolution of the acis images , we deconvolved the images using a maximum likelihood algorithm @xcite as described in our previous works @xcite . for the image deconvolution",
    ", we used 0@xmath15125 sky pixels for the data sets with low photon statistics ( @xmath191000 source counts ) and 0@xmath150625 pixel size for the high statistics data sets ( @xmath201000 source counts ) .",
    "in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] , we display the acis images of snr 1987a from the four observations which have the best photon statistics ( obsid 1967 , 2831 , 2832 , and 3829 ; table  [ tbl : tab1 ] ) .",
    "images from the other three observations with fewer counts have been presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "these broadband x - ray images clearly exhibit the dynamical nature of this young snr . the overall surface brightness has doubled over the two - year period ( @xmath20.09 counts s@xmath6 in 2000 - 12 and @xmath20.19 counts s@xmath6 in 2002 - 12 ) .",
    "while the overall flux distribution between the eastern and western sides remains asymmetrical , the latest data reveal the development of new x - ray spots in the northwest and the southwest .",
    "new x - ray - bright spots have also developed along the eastern side of the snr , making the eastern portion of the x - ray ring more smooth than before .",
    "the overall x - ray morphology of snr 1987a thus appears to become a more complete ring during this two year interval .",
    "these morphological changes are generally in good agreement with the standard model of the blast wave shock front approaching the dense inner ring ( michael et al .",
    "2000 ) : i.e. , the blast wave reached the northeastern side of the inner ring in around 1997 ( @xmath23700 days after the sn explosion ) when the first optical spot emerged @xcite , and it is now reaching the western side of the inner ring . as of 2003 january , the latest optical images taken by the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ revealed that optically bright spots have emerged all around the inner ring @xcite .",
    "this is a good indication of the blast wave now encountering the inner ring on the western side , a few years after it did on the eastern side .",
    "the morphological changes from our _ chandra _ data are in good agreement with those in the optical data .",
    "we discuss more about this dynamical nature of the blast wave in ",
    "[ sec : spectrum ] , based on the spectral analysis results .",
    "morphological investigations with broad sub - band images have revealed remarkable differences between the soft and the hard band x - ray emission features @xcite .",
    "the recent observations with significant photon statistics allow us to repeat this investigation over a larger time base . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , we present three sub - band images of snr 1987a for 2000 - 12 and 2002 - 12 .",
    "both data contain comparable numbers of photons ( @xmath209000 counts ) so that we can make reliable comparisons on the energy - dependent morphological changes over this two year interval .",
    "the sub - bands were chosen primarily to represent the o line features ( the 0.3@xmath00.8 kev band , `` o - band '' hereafter ) , the ne line features ( the 0.8@xmath01.2 kev band , `` ne - band '' hereafer ) , and the mg / si line + any hard - tail emission features ( the 1.2@xmath08.0 kev band , `` h - band '' hereafter ) .",
    "the sub - band boundaries were also chosen to provide comparable photon statistics in each sub - band for reliable comparisons among them . in 2000 - 12 ,",
    "the o- and ne - band x - ray emission was bright only in the northeast and the southeast portions of the snr and these soft x - ray - bright spots were positionally coincident with the optically - bright spots ( figure  [ fig : fig2]a and figure  [ fig : fig2]c ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the h - band x - ray emission was nearly anti - correlated with the soft x - ray features and well correlated with the radio bright features ( figure  [ fig : fig2]e ) .",
    "this remarkable energy - dependent x - ray mophology was interpreted as providing good support for the standard model : i.e. , the soft x - ray and optical spots are emission from the slow shock encountering the dense protrusions of the inner ring and the hard x - ray and the radio spots are emission from the fast shock propagating into the low density regions in between the dense protrusions @xcite . as of 2002 - 12 , the sub - band x - ray images show more complex features than in 2000 - 12 ( figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ) , and might not be adequately described by the simple physical interpretation proposed with the 2000 - 12 data .",
    "on the eastern side , the x - ray emission is brighter and now appears to be a continuous arc rather than spatially separated spots in all three sub - bands ( figure  [ fig : fig2]b , figure  [ fig : fig2]d and figure  [ fig : fig2]f ) . on the western side , new soft and hard x - ray spots have emerged , particularly in the northwestern and the southwestern portions of the inner ring .",
    "these morphological changes suggest that the blast wave shock front is encountering the main part of the inner ring on the eastern side and that it has begun reaching the dense protrusions on the western side .",
    "the increase in the surface brightness is more outstanding in the ne- and h - bands compared to the o - band ( figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "the count rate ratios between 2002 - 12 and 2000 - 12 data , after the quantum efficiency ( qe ) correction ( see   [ sec : spectrum ] ) , are 1.88@xmath210.05 in the o - band , 2.08@xmath210.04 in the ne - band , and 2.05@xmath210.05 in the h - band , while the overall 0.3@xmath08.0 kev band count rate ratio is 2.06@xmath210.03 .",
    "the count rate increase is more significant in the ne - band than in the o - band .",
    "these differential photon flux increases in the sub - band images suggest spectral changes in the x - ray emitting hot plasma over this two year period .    considering the rapid propagation of the supernova blast wave , park et al .",
    "( 2002 ) investigated the possibility of detecting radial expansion of the x - ray remnant , and estimated an average angular expansion of @xmath20@xmath1504 between 1999 october and 2001 april .",
    "the measured expansion rate corresponded to a radial velocity of 5200 @xmath21 2100 km s@xmath6 , with a marginal significance of @xmath22.5 @xmath22 .",
    "we now have three more data points for a more reliable estimate of the radial expansion rate of snr 1987a .",
    "we used the same method as described in park et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for this estimate : i.e. , we constructed radial profiles centered on the mean position of the count distribution ( or `` center of mass '' ) with a 0@xmath1505 annular bin , and then fitted these radial profiles with gaussians in order to obtain the `` peak '' radius averaged around the x - ray ring .",
    "the best - fit gaussian peak radii versus time are displayed in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "the peak radius increases by @xmath20@xmath1506 from 1999 october to 2002 december . the best - fit expansion rate of snr 1987a , indicated by the solid line in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] , is 4167@xmath21773 km s@xmath6 , which confirms the previous estimate @xcite with higher significance ( @xmath25.4 @xmath22 ) .",
    "we note that the x - ray emission is most likely generated between the forward and the reverse shock , but the bright x - ray features appear to be dominated by emission from the forward shock approaching the dense inner ring .",
    "the estimated radii , whose measurements are significantly affected by the positions of the bright x - ray - emitting features , therefore presumably trace the high emissivity region as the blast wave progresses into the dense csm , rather than measuring the actual movement of the x - ray - emitting material .",
    "the blast wave shock front is likely slowing down as it sweeps through the dense csm , at least along the inner ring . upcoming _",
    "observations will be monitored for deviation from linear expansion , which would provide direct evidence for deceleration of the shock front .",
    "the four _ chandra_/acis observations with good statistics ( obsid 1967 , 2831 , 2832 , and 3829 ; table  [ tbl : tab1 ] ) ( @xmath26000@xmath09000 counts ) allow us to investigate spectral changes of the snr over a period of 24 months .",
    "we extracted the source spectrum of snr 1987a from a circular region with a 2@xmath23@xmath03@xmath23 radius for each of the four observations .",
    "the background was estimated from a surrounding annulus with an inner radius of 3@xmath155@xmath04@xmath23 and an outer radius of 7@xmath155@xmath010@xmath23 .",
    "each spectrum has been binned to contain a minimum of 50 counts per channel . for the spectral analysis of our cti - corrected data , we have utilized the response matrices appropriate for the spectral redistribution of the ccd , as generated by townsley et al .",
    "( 2002b ) .",
    "the low energy ( @xmath17 @xmath19 1 kev ) qe of the acis has degraded because of molecular contamination on the optical blocking filter .",
    "we corrected this time - dependent qe degradation by modifying the ancillary response function for each extracted spectrum , utilizing the idl acisabs software .",
    "we fitted individual x - ray spectra of snr 1987a with an nei plane - parallel shock model @xcite , and found that fitted parameters were similar among all four spectra .",
    "we can therefore obtain the best limits on the parameters by performing a combined fit to the four spectra , making the assumption that both n@xmath24 and the elemental abundances are constant during this time interval ( the statistics are not good enough to detect abundance variations ) .",
    "the spectral contributions from the elements he , c , ca , ar , and ni are insignificant in the fitted energy range ( 0.4@xmath05.0 kev ) , so we fixed the abundances of these elements at plausible values .",
    "he and c were set to the abundances appropriate for the inner circumstellar ring @xcite : he = 2.57 and c = 0.09 , relative to solar abundances @xcite .",
    "we fixed the ca (= 0.34 ) , ar (= 0.54 ) and ni (= 0.62 ) abundances to values appropriate for the lmc ism @xcite because the ring abundances were unavailable for these elemental species in lundqvist & fransson ( 1996 ) .",
    "the elements n , o , ne , mg , si , s , and fe typically have significant effects on the x - ray spectral shape in the fitted energy band , and we therefore use the x - ray observations to measure these abundances directly in snrs .",
    "in fact , x - ray line emission from the most of these species was detected from the dispersed spectrum @xcite , although the poor photon statistics did not allow firm measurements of these elemental abundances .",
    "nonetheless , earlier acis data indicated that fixing these elemental abundances at the ring or lmc values could not adequately describe the observed x - ray spectrum of snr 1987a @xcite .",
    "we allowed the abundances of these elements to vary freely , but constrained them to be the same for all four spectra .",
    "the temperature and emission measure , on the other hand , were allowed to vary freely between the four spectra .",
    "the best - fit column density is @xmath25 = 1.7@xmath26 @xmath3 10@xmath27 @xmath5 ( 2@xmath22 uncertainties are quoted throughout this paper ) .",
    "the results of this spectral fitting are summarized in table  [ tbl : tab2 ] and table  [ tbl : tab3 ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , we present the x - ray spectra of snr 1987a from data taken on 2000 - 12 and 2002 - 12 . the best - fit nei shock model is overlaid onto each spectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig4 ] shows that the overall spectral shape has not changed significantly as the x - ray flux increased over the past two years . while the temporal variation of the ionization timescale is uncertain with the current data , the increase in the emission measure is substantial ( table  [ tbl : tab3 ] ) .",
    "there also appears to be a monotonic decrease in the electron temperature for the last two years ( table  [ tbl : tab3 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig5 ] displays these temporal variations of the electron temperature and the volume emission measure .",
    "these overall variations of the electron temperature and the emission measure are typical signatures of a shock slowing down by encountering dense material , which is in good agreement with the standard model of the blast wave - inner ring interaction for snr 1987a .",
    "as the blast wave begins to interact with the dense inner ring , the x - ray spectrum is expected to show evidence for increasing contributions from slow shocks ( @xmath14 @xmath2 500 km s@xmath6 ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , our spectral analysis with a single temperature model suggested a decrease of the best - fit electron temperature over the past two years .",
    "we thus examined the slow shock contribution by fitting the latest spectrum ( 2002 - 12 ) with a two - temperature model .",
    "we forced elemental abundances and the foreground column to be the same for both the soft and hard components , while allowing the electron temperature , ionization timescale , and emission measure to vary separately for each component .",
    "the fitted abundances are generally consistent with those obtained above .",
    "we found that the soft component indicated a highly advanced ionization state ( @xmath28 @xmath2 10@xmath29 @xmath9 s ) , and can be described by a thermal plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) .",
    "we thus repeated the spectral fitting with a cie soft component + an nei hard component by fixing elemental abundances at the best - fit values as presented in table  [ tbl : tab2 ] ( figure  [ fig : fig6 ] ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters from this two - component model fit for the 2002 - 12 data are presented in table  [ tbl : tab4 ] . while the implemention of this two - temperature model was physically motivated by considering the shock - csm interaction , the presence of the additional soft component appears to be supported by the statistics as well : i.e. , we separately fitted the 2002 - 12 data with a single temperature nei model ( @xmath30/@xmath31 = 115.84/101 ) , and an f - test suggested that the statistical improvement in the fit with the two - temperature model is significant ( f - probability is @xmath24 @xmath3 10@xmath32 ) .",
    "the best - fit foreground absorption ( @xmath25 @xmath2 2.3 @xmath3 10@xmath27 @xmath5 ) is some @xmath230% higher than that from the single - temperature model fit ( @xmath25 @xmath2 1.7 @xmath3 10@xmath27 @xmath5 ) , which is perhaps expected with the addition of the soft component .",
    "the higher absorption is in better agreement with that measured by uv spectroscopy ( @xmath25 @xmath2 3 @xmath3 10@xmath27 @xmath5 ; e.g. , fitzpatrick & walborn 1990 ) , and is presumably more realistic .",
    "the low electron temperature ( @xmath7 = 0.22 kev ) for the soft component implies a significantly decelerated shock velocity of @xmath14 @xmath2 400 km s@xmath6 ( assuming an electron - ion equilibrium for this component , as supported by its cie state ) .",
    "the x - ray flux from the slow shock provides @xmath218% of the total flux in the 0.5@xmath010 kev band .",
    "based on the measured @xmath33s ( table  [ tbl : tab4 ] ) , it is evident that the electron density for the soft component is higher than that for the hard component , even assuming the `` same '' x - ray - emitting volume for each component .",
    "we can estimate the densities for the x - ray - emitting regions by considering reasonable geometries for the emission volumes . for the fast shock component ( @xmath7 = 2.44 kev ) , we assume a simple geometry of a spherical shell with an inner radius of 0@xmath156 ( i.e. , @xmath24.5 @xmath3 10@xmath34 cm at the lmc distance of 50 kpc ) where the blast wave began to enter the hii region at an age of @xmath21200 days @xcite . assuming the blast wave has been propagating at a constant velocity of @xmath23000 km s@xmath6@xcite since then , the outer radius is 0@xmath1576 or @xmath25.7 @xmath3 10@xmath34 cm as of 2002 - 12 ( 5791 days ) .",
    "we also assume @xmath8 @xmath35 1.5 @xmath36 for the ring abundances ( e.g. , masai & nomoto 1994 ) . an electron density of @xmath8 @xmath2 235 @xmath9",
    "is then derived from the best - fit emission measure of the hard component ( table  [ tbl : tab4 ] ) .",
    "the density of the dense csm that slows down the blast wave to produce the bulk of the soft x - ray emission is more difficult to estimate because this dense region , containing the inward protrusions , is not resolved and thus the geometry of the x - ray - emitting volume is uncertain . since the optical spots are now present all around the inner ring and the soft x - ray emission appears to be more continuous along the x - ray ring than ever , we make a simple assumption of a shell - like soft x - ray - emitting region .",
    "this soft x - ray emission is most likely from along the inner ring , whose thickness is @xmath20@xmath15088 ( @xmath20.02 pc at the distance of 50 kpc ; jakobsen et al .",
    "1991 ) . considering this ring - like geometry",
    ", we may thus use a cylindrical shell with the ring thickness for the soft component instead of a spherical shell .",
    "we assumed a fast shock velocity of 3000  km s@xmath6 between days 1200 and 3700 , when the shock began interacting with the csm and slowed down to 400  kms@xmath6 . with these assumptions ,",
    "the inner radius of the cylindrical shell is @xmath25.0 @xmath3 10@xmath34 cm and its outer radius is @xmath25.1 @xmath3 10@xmath34 cm .",
    "the estimated average thickness of the dense csm ( @xmath210@xmath37 cm ) is consistent with the `` characteristic dimension '' of optical spot 1 @xcite . with this geometry for the x - ray - emitting region ,",
    "the best - fit volume emission measure for the soft component ( table  [ tbl : tab4 ] ) implies an electron density of @xmath8 @xmath2 7500 @xmath9 .",
    "previous estimates of the densities for the hii region and the inner ring are on the order of @xmath210@xmath38 @xmath9 and @xmath210@xmath39 @xmath9 , respectively @xcite . considering the systematic uncertainties in the adopted geometries and the fact that the blast wave might not have encountered the densest portion of the inner ring yet , the derived densities are in good agreement with the previous results .",
    "the latest x - ray images reveal the development of new x - ray spots on the western side of the snr , which suggests that the blast wave is approaching the inner ring in the west as well as in the east (   [ sec : image ] ) . in order to quantitatively",
    "investigate this hypothesis , we performed two - component model fitting for the eastern and western halves of the snr , and compared the results between 2000 - 12 and 2002 - 12 . because of the small angular size and the apparent asymmetric flux distribution of the snr , defining the `` eastern '' and the `` western '' halves is dependent on how we determine the center of the snr ( e.g. , the `` center of mass '' of the intensity distribution vs. the geometrical center ; michael et al .",
    "our purpose in performing this spectral analysis by halves is to compare the flux variations between 2000 - 12 and 2002 - 12 , presumably caused by the emergence of the new x - ray spots in the western side . for this purpose , we chose centers close to the positions of the faintest x - ray flux near the geometrical center of the remnant based on the broadband images . the eastern and western halves of the snr , determined by these `` centers '' , are intended to effectively separate the bright x - ray spots in the northeastern and northwestern sides of the x - ray ring .",
    "the best - fit spectral parameters for the two halves are generally consistent with those from the entire remnant , although less constrained due to the reduced photon statistics .",
    "the x - ray flux variations between the eastern and western sides of snr 1987a for the last two years are presented in table  [ tbl : tab5 ] .",
    "we found that the 0.5@xmath010 kev band x - ray flux from the slow shock ( the soft spectral component ) has marginally increased by @xmath235% in the eastern half between 2000 and 2002 .",
    "by contrast , the x - ray flux from the slow shock in the western half has significantly increased by a factor of more than 5 for the same time period . for comparison",
    ", the observed x - ray flux originating from the fast shock ( the hard spectral component ) has only increased by a factor of @xmath22 in both the eastern and the western halves .",
    "these differential flux changes between the eastern and the western sides of the snr indicate that the blast wave has reached the dense inner ring and is slowing down in the western side of the snr some @xmath25 years after it did in the eastern side when the first optical spot emerged .",
    "a non - linear increase of the x - ray flux from snr 1987a over the last decade has been reported @xcite .",
    "we present the latest x - ray lightcurve of snr 1987a by combining the _ rosat _ and _ chandra _ data ( table  [ tbl : tab6 ] ; figure  [ fig : fig7 ] ) .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "data were obtained from hasinger , aschenbach , & trmper ( 1996 ) .",
    "the first four _ chandra _ fluxes have been updated by correcting the qe for contamination , which had not been characterized at the time of park et al .",

    "the x - ray flux can be expressed as @xmath1 @xmath40 @xmath41 for 0.01 kev @xmath42 3.4 kev , where @xmath43 is the x - ray emission volume ( e.g. , mckee & cowie 1977 ) .",
    "we assumed @xmath43 @xmath40 @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 is the radial distance from the center of the snr ) and a constant @xmath46 .",
    "we note that the electron temperature appears to be decreasing during this period (   [ sec : spectrum ] ) , but this decrease is small and we assume a constant temperature for the purpose of this simple fit .",
    "( the measured temperature change between 2000 - 12 and 2002 - 12 would imply only @xmath210% change in the x - ray flux estimate . )",
    "the blast wave propagates through a low - denisty hii region before encountering the high - density inner ring ; thus we expect an intermediate density region at the transition between the hii region and the inner ring .",
    "we assumed an exponential density distribution along the radius of the snr in this transition region .",
    "the x - ray flux is then @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the electron density in the hii region , @xmath49 is the radius of the inner ring , @xmath50 is the electron density of the inner ring at @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is a characteristic _ scale height _ of the exponential density distribution .",
    "now , we define @xmath53 as the radius at which the blast wave started to interact with the hii region , @xmath54 as the time since the sn explosion , @xmath14 as the shock velocity , and @xmath55 as @xmath54 at @xmath45 = @xmath53 .",
    "we can then rewrite equation ( 1 ) as @xmath56 ^ 3[1 +   qe^{-\\frac{\\alpha-1-\\beta(\\tau-1)}{s}}]^2 , \\label{eq : eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the x - ray flux at @xmath54 = @xmath55 , @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the density ratio between the inner ring and the hii region @xmath62 , @xmath63 @xmath59 @xmath64 is a modified characteristic scale , @xmath65 is the radius ratio of @xmath66 , and @xmath67 @xmath59 @xmath68 .",
    "based on the radio data @xcite , we chose @xmath53 = 0@xmath156 , @xmath14 = 3000 km s@xmath6 , and @xmath55 = 1200 days since the sn explosion .",
    "we adopted @xmath49 = 0@xmath1583 from the optical data ( e.g. , jakobsen et al .",
    "we can therefore fit the x - ray lightcurve in terms of @xmath57 , @xmath61 , and @xmath63 .",
    "the best - fit parameters are @xmath57 = ( 8.0@xmath212.0 ) @xmath3 10@xmath69 ergs @xmath5 s@xmath6 , @xmath62 = 17.6@xmath211.9 , and @xmath52 = 0@xmath15057@xmath210@xmath15003 with @xmath70 = 7.4/11 .",
    "this best - fit model is displayed as a dashed - curve in figure  [ fig : fig7 ] .",
    "the fitted @xmath57 is in good agreement with the _ rosat _ data .",
    "the best - fit density ratio is considerably lower than the estimates from the modeling of previous observations in other wavelengths ( typically @xmath62 @xmath2 100 ; e.g. , chevalier & dwarkadas 1995 ; borkowski , blondin , & mccray 1997 ; lundqvist & franssen 1996 ) .",
    "while it is possible that this is due to the simplicity of our model , we note that this density ratio is also consistent with that derived from our spectral analysis (   [ sec : spectrum ] ) within a factor of @xmath22 .",
    "the data points used in our fit are _ incomplete _ : i.e. , the blast wave shock front has not yet swept through the densest portions of the ring , hence our x - ray lightcurve has not yet peaked .",
    "we thus expect even steeper flux increases with upcoming data .",
    "the identification of sn 1987a as a core - collapse sn explosion , as evidenced by the massive , blue supergiant progenitor star and by the detection of the neutrino burst coincident with the sn explosion , predicts the existence of a compact remnant , most likely a neutron star , at the center of the snr .",
    "however , we have not detected x - ray emission from the embedded central point source .",
    "this non - detection of the central point source is not surprising because the stellar debris from the sn explosion is expected to remain opaque in the radio through x - ray wavelengths for decades after the sn event @xcite .",
    "we have estimated upper limits for the x - ray emission from the embedded point source by simulating a point source at the center of the observed x - ray images of snr 1987a using the monte carlo technique described previously @xcite .",
    "we obtain a 90% confidence upper limit for the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity , @xmath10 = 1.5 @xmath3 10@xmath12 ergs s@xmath6 , in the 2@xmath010 kev band for any embedded central point source , somewhat lower than previous limits .",
    "as of 2002 december , we have performed a total of seven observations of snr 1987a with the _ chandra_/acis . with superb angular resolution and moderate spectral resolution , the _",
    "chandra_/acis data have provided a unique opportunity to monitor the morphological and spectral evolution of the x - ray remnant of sn 1987a .",
    "the x - ray remnant is ring - like with an asymmetric flux distribution between the eastern and western sides .",
    "the overall broadband surface brightness has doubled between 2000 december and 2002 december .",
    "we detected the development of new x - ray - bright spots in the western side of the remnant in addition to the previously - known features in the eastern side .",
    "the x - ray emission features in the eastern side are now more continuous than before , while new x - ray spots are emerging in the western side .",
    "these morphological changes appear to indicate that the blast wave is approaching closer to the main portion of the dense inner ring .",
    "we detect an average angular expansion of @xmath20@xmath1506 between 1999 october and 2002 december , which corresponds to an average radial velocity of @xmath14 @xmath2 4167 km s@xmath6 for the last four years .",
    "our spectral analysis suggests that the average electron temperature of the shock has been decreasing , whereas the observed flux significantly increased .",
    "the best - fit elemental abundances are generally consistent with those of the lmc ism , and thus the x - ray emission in snr 1987a appears to be dominated by that from the shocked ism rather than shocked metal - rich ejecta .",
    "a two - temperature shock model indicates that the contribution from the decelerated ( by the dense csm ) slow shock ( @xmath14 @xmath2 400 km s@xmath6 ) to the observed x - ray flux is @xmath218% of the total flux as of 2002 december .",
    "it is notable that the slow shock contribution has increased more significantly in the western side than in the eastern side since 2000 december .",
    "this spectral evolution is consistent with the morphological evolution .",
    "both imply that the blast wave is now encountering the dense circumstellar material in the western side in addition to the eastern side .",
    "based on the two - temperature model , we derive electron densities @xmath8 @xmath2 235 @xmath9 for the hard x - ray emission ( @xmath7 = 2.44 kev ) from the fast shock and @xmath8 @xmath2 7500 @xmath9 for the soft component ( @xmath7 = 0.22 kev ) from the slow shock decelerated by the dense inner ring .    the x - ray lightcurve has been steepening rapidly since 2000 . as of 2002 december , the 0.5@xmath02 kev band x - ray flux ( @xmath1 @xmath2 6 @xmath3 10@xmath4 ergs @xmath5 s@xmath6 ) is nearly four times brighter than in 1999 october when this monitoring program began .",
    "we fit the x - ray lightcurve with a non - linear model by assuming an exponential density distribution in the transition regions between the hii region and the inner ring .",
    "the best - fit model implies a density contrast of @xmath217 between these two regions , which is consistent with the density estimates from the spectral fitting .",
    "this result is also in plausible agreement with the previous density estimates .",
    "our results clearly demonstrate the extremely dynamic nature of snr 1987a .",
    "the morphological and spectral characteristics are rapidly changing on a time scale of months .",
    "moreover , the latest information obtained by our _ chandra _ data strongly indicates that the predicted dramatic brightening ( up to nearly three orders of magnitude ) , as the blast wave sweeps through the dense csm , might be underway .",
    "this remarkable event represents the first - ever observation of the _ birth of a supernova remnant_. this monitoring program of snr 1987a should thus continue in coming years .",
    "in addition to the imaging observations , high spectral resolution grating observations with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ should be performed in order to determine the details of the shock parameters such as the electron / ion temperatures , ionization states , the elemental abundances , and the 3-dimensional structure of the blast wave shock and the ejecta material .",
    "although the creation of a compact remnant , probably a neutron star , is expected from the identified core - collapse explosion for sn 1987a , we have yet to detect direct observational evidence for a central pointlike source .",
    "this non - detection of a point source appears to be caused by the cold , dense stellar debris around the center of the snr , which will most likely remain optically thick in the x - ray band for more than a decade .",
    "we obtain an upper limit on the observed 2@xmath010 kev x - ray luminosity from any embedded central point source of @xmath10 @xmath2 1.5 @xmath3 10@xmath12 ergs s@xmath6 .",
    "the authors thank p. challis and the supernova intensive study ( sins ) collaboration for providing their _ hst _ images .",
    "we also thank d. manchester and b. gaensler for providing the radio images taken with _ atca_. this work was supported in part by nasa under contract nag8 - 01128 and by sao under grant go1 - 2064b and go2 - 3098a .",
