    "qsos at redshifts @xmath0 have been discovered by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) recently ( @xcite ) .",
    "their spectra have shown the existence of the gunn - peterson absorption trough @xcite at wavelengths blueward of the ly@xmath5 emission line , which suggests that hydrogen in the early universe is significantly neutral ( @xmath6 in mass average ; @xcite ) . despite the presence of the gunn - peterson trough in the spectra ,",
    "a significant amount of flux is transmitted at wavelengths blueward of but near the center of the ly@xmath5 line , which suggests that the regions surrounding these highest redshift qsos are highly ionized by qso photons ( i.e. , the proximity effect of qsos , e.g. , in @xcite ) .",
    "these highly ionized regions are generally idealized as spherical and called `` strmgren spheres . ''",
    "their radii ( or the strmgren radii ) can be estimated from the wavelength difference between the gunn - peterson trough and the ly@xmath5 line center ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "physically the sizes of the highly ionized regions are closely related to not only the neutral hydrogen distribution in the local universe of these qsos before their nuclear activities turn on but also the subsequent qso luminosity evolution , either of which thus may be constrained by the strmgren radii estimated from qso spectra provided that the range of the other one is given .",
    "for example , using the observationally determined strmgren radii and assuming the neutral hydrogen fraction ( defined by the ratio of the neutral hydrogen number density to the total hydrogen number density ) @xmath7 , @xcite found that the lifetime of one highest redshift qso is not shorter than @xmath8 ( see also pentericci et al .",
    "2002 ) and @xcite got a substantially shorter lifetime for two ; using the measured strmgren radii of two highest redshift qsos and some independent constraints on the qso lifetime obtained by other studies , @xcite argued that @xmath9 may be higher than tens of percent at @xmath10 , which is significantly higher than the lower limit of @xmath11 constrained by the flux upper limit of the gunn - peterson absorption trough @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite and @xcite investigated the structure of the transmitted spectra at wavelengths blueward of the ly@xmath5 line and pointed out that the red damping wing of the gunn - peterson trough might leave detectable features there @xcite , which may also help to constrain @xmath9 ( see a recent study by @xcite using mock data from simulations .    in most previous investigations on the reionization process around the highest redshift qsos , the qsos are implicitly assumed to be located in cosmic average regions .",
    "however , in the hierarchical formation and evolution scenario of galaxies and qsos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , luminous qsos ( especially those at high redshifts @xmath0 ) are located in rare overdense regions . the structure formation in these regions and",
    "consequently the gas distribution , star formation , and reionization of the neutral hydrogen may be significantly biased away from those in the regions with cosmic mean density . some discussions in a few recent papers",
    "are also related to some biasing effects of a dense environment ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to quantitatively investigate the dense environment of the highest redshift qsos , the reionization in their local universe due to ionizing photons from both stars and qsos , and the evolution of their strmgren spheres .",
    "comparison of the expected strmgren radii from the more realistic model with observations would improve our understanding of the universe s reionization history and the formation and evolution of qsos .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the observational properties of the highest redshift qsos that have the gunn - peterson trough are reviewed in ",
    "[ sec : data ] . in ",
    "[ sec : environ ] , we investigate the environment around these qsos in the framework of the cosmic density perturbation and structure formation theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we first estimate how dense the environment is from the number density of the highest redshift qsos .",
    "then we introduce a hybrid model ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) based on the excursion set approach of the press - schechter formula @xcite to see how the structure or halo formation is enhanced in these rare overdense regions in   [ sec : subhaloes ] .",
    "gas in halos may be shock heated , collisionally ionized , and then cool to form stars , galaxies , and/or qsos .",
    "ionizing photons from stars and qsos will jointly contribute to the reionization of the surrounding neutral hydrogen . in this paper",
    "we isolate their effects and first consider the reionization due to stars ( the variable @xmath9 in this paper represents the neutral hydrogen fraction obtained after considering the reionization due to stars but before the reionization due to the qso becomes effective ) .",
    "the justification for this isolation is that before the cosmic time that the qso redshift corresponds to , the qso ionizing photon emission rate was high enough to be comparable to ( or higher than ) the ionizing photon emission rate from stars only in a short period ( a few times @xmath2 ) and the cumulative number of ionizing photons are mainly from stars ( see detailed discussion in   [ sec : subreion ] and [ sec : model ] ) . in   [ sec : subreion ] , using some simple star formation models , we find that more than 80%90% of neutral hydrogen in these dense regions is ionized by photons from stars .",
    "inhomogeneity or clumpiness of hydrogen may significantly affect the reionization process . in ",
    "[ sec : clump ] we give a rough estimate of the clumpiness of hydrogen ionized by qso photons , based on the halo distribution obtained in   [ sec : subhaloes ] , some numerical simulation results obtained in other studies , and some physical arguments . in the environment of the highest redshift qsos analyzed in   [ sec : environ ] , we study the evolution of the apparent size of the strmgren sphere highly ionized by qso photons in   [ sec : rsph ] .",
    "the model results are compared with observations and the implications are discussed .",
    "the main conclusions are summarized in   [ sec : con ] .    throughout this paper , we adopt a standard @xmath12cdm cosmological model with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 @xcite .",

    "the redshift may be determined from the ly@xmath5 line ( e.g. , for sdss j1623 + 3112 ; @xcite ) , and the typical redshift error is @xmath20 , which is mainly caused by the uncertainty in the determination of the location of the line center in the spectra .",
    "the redshift of sdss j1148 + 5251 is precisely determined from co and mg@xmath21 lines @xcite , and we simply assign a small error of @xmath22 to its redshift ( similarly for sdss j1048 + 4637 whose redshift is determined by mg@xmath23 line ; @xcite ) . although the redshift of sdss j1030 + 0524 has also been determined from metal lines ( e.g. , c@xmath24 ) , the redshift error can still be as large as 0.02 , caused by the possible blueshift of the c@xmath24 line ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and we therefore set its redshift error to be @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the strmgren radii of three qsos in table  [ tab : tab1 ] have been estimated through the difference between the qso redshift and the redshift of the onset of the ly@xmath5 gunn - peterson trough in their spectra in the literature ( i.e. , @xmath27 ; see also @xmath28 in tab .",

    "there may also exist uncertainties in the determination of the onset redshift of the gunn - peterson troughs , which further introduce uncertainties in the estimate of the strmgren radii .",
    "for example , @xcite point out that the radius estimated through the ly@xmath5 trough may only give a lower limit of the strmgren radius and that a better estimate may be obtained by using the ly@xmath29 trough . using the ly@xmath29 trough and some numerical simulation results ,",

    "note that the new estimate might be affected by the numerical simulation used in the analysis @xcite , which does not well represent the overdense environment of the highest redshift qsos discussed in this paper .",
    "in addition , other qsos listed in table  [ tab : tab1 ] do not have the strmgren radius estimated by using the ly@xmath29 trough in the literature , and thus we still mainly use the values estimated from the ly@xmath5 troughs for consistency in this paper and discuss the implication of a possible systematically larger value of the observational strmgren radius in   [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we estimate the ionizing photon emission rates of these qsos , @xmath32 , by using their absolute magnitude @xmath33 at @xmath34 listed in table  [ tab : tab1 ] ( compiled from @xcite ) and the spectral templates of relatively low redshift qsos ( @xmath35 ) shown in @xcite .",

    "we count photons with energy in the range 13.654.4@xmath42 as ionizing photons .",
    "since so far little information on the radio properties of the highest redshift qsos is available , we obtain two emission rates for each qso listed in table  [ tab : tab1 ] , the smaller of which is obtained by adopting the spectral indices of radio - loud qsos and the larger of which is obtained by adopting the spectral indices of radio - quiet qsos .",
    "we take the middle point of the whole range of the two values ( including their errors ) as @xmath32 and take the whole range as the error range of @xmath32 ( see also the filled circles and their horizontal error bars in fig .  [",
    "fig : f3]a ) .",
    "note that for sdss j1030 + 0524 , compared to the rate listed in table  [ tab : tab1 ] , a substantially smaller rate is obtained in @xcite by fitting the spectrum of the qso in a surrounding hydrogen density distribution given by a numerical simulation . as mentioned above ,",
    "the numerical simulation used in @xcite mimics the cosmic average environment rather than the rare overdense environment around the highest redshift qsos ; thus the smaller rate may be an underestimate since more ionizing photons would be required to balance the recombination in a denser environment .",
    "the highest redshift qsos are extremely rare and their comoving number density @xmath43 is roughly the same as the density of the qsos with absolute magnitude @xmath44 at @xmath45 estimated by @xcite , i.e. , @xmath46 .",

    "if the perturbations on the scale of @xmath50 are still in the linear growth regime at redshift @xmath51 , the mean overdensity @xmath61 follows a gaussian distribution : & & p(|_r , z)d|_r + & & = d|_r , [ eq : denprob ] and the probability that a random region with scale @xmath50 has a mean overdensity higher than a value @xmath62 is given by ( > |_r,z)=^ _ |_rp(|_r , z)d|_r .",

    "for the highest redshift qsos , we simply assume @xmath70 because most sufficiently massive halos ( e.g. , @xmath71 ) at @xmath45 are actually formed within a period ( from @xmath72 to @xmath73 ; e.g. , see fig .  1 in @xcite ) not significantly longer than the qso lifetime ( @xmath74 a few times @xmath2 ; @xcite ; see more discussions about the qso lifetime in   [ sec : rsph ] ) . by multiplying equation ( [ eq : overprob ] ) by a factor of 2 ( this factor comes from the so - called cloud - in - cloud problem ; see discussions in @xcite ) and then setting it equal to equation ( [ eq : pduty ] ) , we obtain that the mean overdensity of the regions associated with the highest redshift qsos is @xmath75 .",
    "since the overdensity distribution @xmath76 decreases exponentially at the high overdensity end , most of these overdense regions associated with the highest redshift qsos do not have a mean overdensity significantly higher than @xmath77 , but near the value .",
    "note that the connection of equation ( [ eq : overprob ] ) with equation ( [ eq : pduty ] ) above has assumed a one - to - two correspondence between the likelihood of finding a region with mean overdensity above a certain value and the likelihood of a same - sized region containing a halo capable of hosting a quasar .",
    "although in principle there might exist regions with overdensity above the certain value but not containing such a halo , the simple approach above is good enough in practice for the rare overdense regions and for the purpose of this paper .",
    "for example , given a halo with a certain mass , the method in barkana ( 2004 ; for simplicity the details are not presented here ) , which is also based on the ( extended ) press - schechter formalism , may provide the expected average overdensity within a certain region around the halo and the standard deviation of the overdensity . assuming that the host halos of the highest redshift qsos are around @xmath78 ( or @xmath79 ) and using the method in @xcite , we obtain an average overdensity of @xmath80 ( or @xmath81 ) within the region with radius @xmath82 surrounding the halo , which is smaller than the estimate above .",

    "the different solid lines are for qsos at different redshifts ( @xmath318 , 6.3 , and 6.4 ; top to bottom ) .",
    "we also illustrate the effects of @xmath215 by showing the results obtained by three other values of @xmath215=20 , 30 , and 45 in figure  [ fig : f3]a ( top , middle , and bottom dotted lines , respectively ; @xmath298 ) .",
    "the relation between the model and observational results for the three qsos are more explicitly shown in figure  [ fig : f3]b ( see solid circles ) .",
    "as seen from figure  [ fig : f3 ] , the model results are remarkably consistent with observations , which supports that the lifetimes of the highest redshift qsos are around or longer than a few times @xmath2 , as is the lifetime of the main population of qsos ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the remarkable consistency also supports that the observational sizes of the strmgren spheres of the highest redshift qsos can be self - consistently explained by the fact that they are located in rare overdense regions and that the neutral hydrogen fraction in these regions is in the range from several percent to 10%20% ( before considering the reionization due to qso photons )",
    ". a much smaller neutral hydrogen fraction ( e.g. , @xmath319 ) will not be consistent with the clumping factor used , since @xmath305 implies that a significant fraction of the neutral hydrogen ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : xhmini ] ) remains in ( mini)halos ( which was neither ionized by the ionizing photons from stars nor photo - evaporated out of the halos ) and contributes to @xmath215 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : xhmini ] ) . unless @xmath215 is much smaller than the estimate in this paper ( e.g. , because of stronger photo - evaporation of baryons in minihalos )",
    ", a much shorter qso lifetime ( @xmath320 ) will not be consistent with the observations of @xmath27 since @xmath292 decreases with decreasing @xmath274 at short-@xmath274 ends ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] ) .    the solution of @xmath292 in model ii is lower than that in model i by at most @xmath321^{1/3}\\sim \\tau\\rec/(3\\tau_s)$ ] .",
    "an independent constraint on the timescale @xmath278 may be obtained by comparing the result of model ii with the observation , as shown in figure  [ fig : f3]b , but this may require precise measurements of the observational strmgren radius @xmath27 . the current observational error of @xmath27 ( @xmath3225%30% ; see tab .",
    "[ tab : tab1 ] ) and the required consistency with the observation may give the constraint to be @xmath32317 .",
    "the model results of @xmath324 above are obtained by using the average clumping factor ( over all the lines of sight ) . a significant contribution to",
    "the clumping factor comes from the neutral hydrogen in halos . in sparse regions ,",
    "the ionizing photons may have been absorbed before they encounter any halo with mass greater than @xmath97 at a significant fraction of the lines of sight .",
    "thus the average contribution of component iii to @xmath215 may be an overestimate when applying it to a specific line of sight ( see discussions in ",
    "[ sec : clump ] ) .",
    "hence , the model results above are usually appropriate to be applied to the observed high - luminosity qsos located in dense regions , but are underestimates for low - luminosity qsos ( e.g. , ionizing photon emission rate @xmath325 at @xmath3066.26.4 ) located in less dense regions .",
    "the expected range of @xmath292 for low - luminosity qsos can be estimated in the following way . by starting with their number density @xmath326 ( obtained by extrapolating the luminosity function of the highest redshift qsos with a power - law index of @xmath327 ; see details in @xcite ) at the faint end and doing similar quantitative analysis for the environment around the low - luminosity qsos as done for the high - luminosity qsos above , we find that the clumping factor @xmath215 is around @xmath246 for those lines of sight along which one halo with mass greater than @xmath97 can be encountered within the strmgren sphere , and around @xmath328 for other lines of sight ( e.g. , 50% of all the lines of sight ) along which no halo with mass greater than @xmath97 is encountered ( the details of the calculations are not given here for simplicity ) . therefore , at a random line of sight , the size of the strmgren spheres around the low - luminosity qsos are roughly in the range of the results obtained by using @xmath329 ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : f3]a ) and @xmath305 ( see the region labeled by `` ? '' between the dashed line and the solid lines in fig .  [",
    "fig : f3]a ) .",
    "we believe that comparison of the range with future observations of the strmgren radii of low - luminosity qsos would further give some tests or constraints on the analysis or assumptions made in this paper , for example , on whether the major part of the clumping factor is due to the remaining neutral hydrogen in halos .",
    "in addition , we note that a higher neutral hydrogen fraction ( @xmath330 if @xmath331  yr ) is obtained in @xcite , but it is obtained by using a much smaller clumping factor and without considering the detailed effects of the structure and star formation in the dense environment surrounding the highest redshift qsos .",
    "also , as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : data ] the strmgren radius of sdss 1030 + 0524 estimated by @xcite through the ly@xmath29 trough in the qso spectra ( @xmath30 ) is larger than the value ( @xmath31 ) listed in table [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "a possibly larger observational strmgren radius may suggest that the realistic clumping factor for this qso is smaller than the estimate in this paper ( e.g. , @xmath215 may be as low as @xmath332 ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : f2 ] ) .",
    "a smaller @xmath215 may be caused by a stronger photoevaporation process in minihalos than that assumed in this paper .",
    "if more minihalos were photoevaporated , besides @xmath215 , the neutral hydrogen fraction to be ionized by the central qso , @xmath9 , may also decrease . in short ,",
    "most of the analysis in this paper will not be qualitatively affected even if the strmgren radii estimated from current observations deviate slightly from reality .",
    "as indicated in figure  [ fig : f1 ] , in the rare overdense regions around the highest redshift qsos , the ionizing photon production per hydrogen atom in the igm at @xmath333 is already comparable to or higher than that of the cosmic average at @xmath45 ( when the reionization is complete ) .",
    "however , the reionization in the rare overdense regions around the highest redshift qsos is not complete at a redshift significantly higher than @xmath134 since neutral hydrogen must remain in the high - density regions to be ionized by qso photons to satisfy the observational constraint from the strmgren radius analyzed in this paper .",
    "the incomplete reionization in the overdense regions is partly caused by the fact that they have more high - density gas and that the gas is easier to recombine .",
    "this environmental effect has also been revealed in the numerical simulation by @xcite , which shows that the reionization process in overdense regions may be complete at a time later than that in cosmic average regions , although the ionizing photon production per hydrogen atom in the igm is higher in overdense environments than in cosmic average regions .",
    "according to this environmental effect revealed by @xcite , the cosmic average neutral hydrogen fraction at @xmath1 should be not higher than 10%20% ( the upper limit of @xmath9 surrounding the highest redshift qsos ) .",
    "the observational flux upper limit of the gunn - peterson troughs has constrained the lower limit of the neutral hydrogen fraction ( in mass ) of the universe at @xmath1 to be 1% @xcite .",
    "therefore , the cosmic average neutral hydrogen fraction at @xmath1 may be only a few percent .",
    "this low neutral hydrogen fraction alleviates the apparent conflict in reionization between the constraint from the highest redshift qsos ( e.g. , @xcite ) and that from the polarization spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( i.e. , an early reionization at @xmath334 or so ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we have investigated the dense environment , the reionization process , and the evolution of the strmgren sphere around the highest redshift qsos having gunn - peterson troughs ( @xmath0 ) , and we have provided constraints on the intrinsic properties of qsos and the reionization history of the universe by comparing the observed strmgren radii with model results .",
    "we have shown that the structure formation and consequently the gas distribution and star formation in the overdense regions around the highest redshift qsos are biased from the cosmic average . before the nuclear activity of the qso turns on and its ionizing photon emission rate is high enough , the reionization in the overdense region surrounding the qso is mainly contributed by stars , and starts from relatively low density subregions . using some simple models of star formation and some analysis on the photoionization process inside and outside of halos ( including minihalos ) , we have argued that a significant fraction of hydrogen in the strmgren sphere around the qsos is ionized by the ionizing photons from stars , and only about several percent to at most 10%20% of hydrogen is left ( e.g. , in minihalos , halos , or high - density subregions ) to be ionized by the qso photons .",
    "the cosmic average neutral hydrogen fraction at @xmath1 is also be smaller than the upper limit of 10%20% obtained for the overdense regions and may be only a few percent , since overdense regions contain more high - density gas and are more difficult to reionize @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed the clumping property of hydrogen ionized by qsos and studied the evolution of the apparent size of the strmgren sphere .",
    "we have found that if the qso lifetime is about or longer than a few times @xmath335 yr , as is the lifetime of the main population of qsos ( with comoving number density peaked at @xmath323 ) , the expected strmgren radii from our models are very consistent with observations .",
    "with such a qso lifetime , the ages of most of observed qsos are long enough that the qso photon emission is balanced by the recombination of the hydrogen ionized by qsos in their strmgren spheres , and the expected strmgren radii from the balance are independent of the detailed values of the qso ages .",
    "we also point out a statistical method involving a larger sample of highest redshift qsos having gunn - peterson troughs in future observations , which may potentially check or rule out the possibility that the qsos have a shorter lifetime ( e.g. , @xmath4 ) even without an accurate estimate of the hydrogen clumping property .",
