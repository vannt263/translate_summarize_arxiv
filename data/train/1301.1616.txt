    "the word chiral , which comes from the greek @xmath1 for hand , was introduced by lord kelvin in 1904 to describe an object whose image in a plane mirror can not be brought in coincidence with itself @xcite .",
    "the two images are called enantiomorphs ( enantiomers for molecules ) .",
    "an archetype is the cylindrical helix ( see figure [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "pasteur was before aware of the concept , which he called `` dissymtrie '' .",
    "he identified it through crystal morphology and optical activity @xcite .",
    "one of his major fulfillments had been to separate a racemic mixture ( equal proportions of enantiomorphic species ) of sodium ammonium paratartrate in two enantiopure subsets which were rotating the plane of polarization of a linearly polarized ingoing light by angles of equal magnitude but of opposite sign .",
    "chirality is a key property in * chemistry and biology * @xcite .",
    "it is crucial to life , which basically is homochiral .",
    "a number of biological functions are activated or inhibited according to highly precise molecular mechanisms , in which chiral host molecules recognize enantiomeric guest molecules in different ways .",
    "enantiomers often smell and taste differently .",
    "the structural difference between enantiomers can be serious with respect to the actions of synthetic drugs , resulting for instance in marked differences in the pharmacological efficiencies of enantiomers .",
    "the importance of these issues has led to the attribution of the nobel prize of chemistry in 2001 to william s. knowles , ryoji noyori and k. barry sharpless for their work on chiral catalysis .",
    "chirality is often an emergent phenomenon , that is to say inherent to a specific organization of sub - objects not necessarily chiral , but is also encountered at the most fundamental level .",
    "it was for instance found out that the neutrino displays only a left helicity , that is to say its spin is observed systematically antiparallel to its linear momentum .",
    "this is explained by postulating that the * weak interaction * is intrinsically not invariant under mirror symmetry @xcite , acting only on left - chiral fermions or right - chiral anti - fermions .",
    ", which has eigenvalues @xmath2 , where @xmath3 are the dirac s operators defined from the anticommutation relation @xmath4 with @xmath5 the identity operator and @xmath6 the minkowski metric .",
    "note also that the helicity of a fermion is the same as its chirality solely in the zero mass limit .",
    "if the fermion is massive then its helicity is a frame dependent property , unlike its chirality . ]",
    "the discovery of the breaking of the mirror symmetry by the weak interactions was so unexpected that it had led to the attribution of the nobel prize of physics in 1957 to chen ning yang and tsung - dao lee for their insightful contributions to the matter .",
    "chirality can be mathematically defined within any metric space by stating that an object is chiral if the group of isometries ( metric preserving bijective transformations ) under which it is invariant is generated by products of squared isometries @xcite . in the case of euclidean space for instance , the group of invariance must not contain any indirect isometries , namely centers of inversion , mirrors , and rotoreflection ( or rotoinversion ) axes . when an object is composite , the metric space and group of isometries to consider are of course the ones built from the cartesian product of the metric spaces and groups of isometries associated to each component of the object .",
    "the concept is thus considerably generalized , though it can lead to confusion if the underlying space is not explicitly specified",
    ". a molecule for instance might be geometrically achiral , but associated with a chiral graph ( the space isometries then are graph automorphisms , which all must decompose into even numbers of edge preserving vertex transpositions ) . of a set @xmath7 of vertices and a set @xmath8 of edges such that @xmath9 ( which means that every edge joins either two vertices or a vertex to itself ) .",
    "a graph automorphism is a permutation @xmath10 of the set of vertices @xmath7 such that the pair of vertices @xmath11 forms an edge if and only if the pair @xmath12 of transformed vertices forms en edge too .",
    "these edge - preserving transformations make up the automorphism group of a graph .",
    "a graph automorphism is a product of squared graph automorphisms if and only if it decomposes into an even number of edge - preserving transpositions .",
    "it follows from the general definition of chirality that if all the automorphisms of a graph are generated by products of even numbers of edge - preserving transpositions then the graph is chiral . ] as a whole it is chiral ( this amounts to care not only about the geometry of the molecule but also about its constitutive elements as well as of the intramolecular interactions ) .",
    "chirality depends on the space dimensionality .",
    "a chiral object in two dimensions , such as a non isosceles triangle , becomes achiral in three dimensions ( see figure [ fig:1 ] ) , since the plane containing the 2-dimensional object becomes then a mirror symmetry . as a matter of fact ,",
    "every @xmath13-dimensional object in a @xmath14-dimensional space is achiral as soon as @xmath15 .",
    "it is indeed trivially identical to its ( unchanged ) image with respect to any @xmath16-dimensional hyperplane mirror containing the object .",
    "an alternative definition is used in crystallography , which refers to the concept of centrosymmetry rather than mirror symmetry ( we recall that a mirror is merely a combination of a two - fold rotation and a spatial inversion ) .",
    "it stipulates that a chiral object is not superposable by pure rotation and translation on its image formed by inversion through a point @xcite .",
    "we remind that an inversion transformation amounts to transforming every point to the point of opposite coordinates if its fixed point is taken as the space origin .",
    "it is then customary to call it parity and denote it with the symbol p. a necessary condition for a crystal structure to be chiral is that it is non - centrosymmetric .",
    "this is not sufficient however .",
    "the point group must contain only proper rotation symmetries .",
    "non - centrosymmetric crystal structures can be achiral when the point group contains improper symmetry elements and when the structure and its image by inversion symmetry can be brought in coincidence by pure rotation .",
    "centrosymmetric crystal structures on the other hand are always achiral .",
    "the two enantiomorphs of a chiral structure may belong either to the same space group ( an example is the non - centrosymmetric space group @xmath17 ) or to two distinct space groups transforming into each other by inversion .",
    "there are 11 pairs of such space groups , for instance @xmath18 and @xmath19 , among the 65 space groups containing only proper symmetry elements , compatible with chiral structures .",
    "optical activity had been historically an efficient mean to identify crystal chirality , but had been also misleading because there is no one - to - one correspondence between the two properties .",
    "optical activity had been observed in achiral single crystals ( belonging to the @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 crystal classes ) .",
    "chirality of crystals can be adequately determined by anomalous ( or resonant ) x - ray scattering ( or electron scattering ) , as first achieved by j.m .",
    "_ on the tartaric acid in 1951 @xcite .",
    "owing to absorption induced phase shift , the scattering factor acquires an imaginary component and the scattering intensities at the opposite scattering vectors @xmath24 have no longer to be necessarily equal .",
    "a systematic measurement of these friedel pairs allows estimating the enantiomorph polarity of real crystals @xcite .",
    "chirality becomes even more subtle when dynamical aspects have to be taken into account because one has to care about the time inversion .",
    "it is customary to denote this transformation with the symbol t. it is accounted for by an anti - unitary operator in quantum mechanics .",
    "classically , it may be interpreted as reversing all the motions , effective and stationary . if a physical quantity is linearly built over a motion ( linear momentum , angular momentum , magnetic moment @xmath25 curl of a current density field @xmath25 infinitesimal current loop circulation , @xmath26 ) then it will be reversed too , in which case it is said t - odd .",
    "if a physical quantity is invariant under t ( linear translation , angular displacement , electric moment , @xmath26 ) then it is said t - even .",
    "we remind that if a physical quantity is space dependent then it might be reversed under the space inversion p ( linear translation , linear momentum , electric moment , @xmath26 ) , in which case it is said p - odd ( or pseudo - scalar if it is a scalar and more generically polar ) . if a physical quantity is invariant under p ( angular displacement , angular momentum , magnetic moment , @xmath26 ) then it is said p - even ( or true scalar if it is a scalar and more generically axial ) . a physical quantity",
    "most generally might be a mixed tensor ( or a spinor ) , p - odd or p - even and t - odd or t - even in specified components .",
    "it is clear that the effects of the space inversion p and of the time inversion t coincide or differ according to the involved physical quantities , which might alter the concept of chirality .",
    "it matters in particular to wonder whether spatial enantiomorphism is still a sufficient condition of chirality . as an example",
    ", a collinear arrangement of an electric field , which is a t - even polar vector field , and of a magnetic field , which is a t - odd axial vector field , generates an enantiomorphism since parallel and antiparallel configurations are interconverted by space inversion p and are non superposable .",
    "these configurations however are also interconverted by time inversion t combined with a rotation by the angle @xmath10 .",
    "it appears that such an arrangement of fields fails to induce any enantioselective process , for instance to bias a chemical reaction towards the production in excess of a given enantiomer .",
    "it thus becomes questionable to consider it as effectively chiral . according to barron @xcite : `` true chirality is exhibited by systems that exist in two distinct enantiomorphic states that are interconverted by space inversion but not by time reversal combined with any proper spatial rotation and translation '' .",
    "a spatial enantiomorphism that can be recovered by time - inversion combined with a proper spatial rotation or a translation is said associated with false chirality to emphasize the distinction .",
    "a true chirality is therefore distinguished from a false one if it is characterized by a t - even pseudo - scalar quantity .",
    "an example of true chirality is that of a coherent beam of photons with a given ( either positive or negative ) helicity / chirality ( massless boson ) .",
    "one here is concerned with a t - odd polar vector ( linear momentum ) and a t - odd axial vector ( photon spin ) , the scalar product of which is a t - even pseudo scalar ( helicity @xmath25 projection of the photon spin on its linear momentum ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated that ( right- or left- ) circularly polarized light can effectively influence the chirality of photochemical reaction products @xcite .",
    "chirality is often misapprehended in magnetism .",
    "a confusion for instance prevailed for long between the optical activity that occurs when a linearly polarized light crosses a media lacking mirror symmetry and the faraday rotation that occurs when a linearly polarized light longitudinally crosses a media permeated by a static magnetic field . as earlier emphasized by lord kelvin , quoting michael faraday who was aware of the fact , the two phenomena are basically distinct @xcite . when the light path is reversed the faraday rotation changes sign whereas the optical activity does not .",
    "the mistake led to a series of misleading scenarios of absolute enantioselectivity ( ability to produce an enantiomeric excess in an otherwise racemic mix ) , which have failed .",
    "of course , this does not mean that a static magnetic field never contributes to an enantioselection .",
    "an example is magnetochiral dichroism @xcite , which would arise from slightly different absorptions of light by chiral molecules according to whether the light beam , whatever its polarization , travels parallel or antiparallel to an externally applied magnetic field .",
    "a t - odd polar vector , the light wavevector , is here combined with a t - odd axial vector , the magnetic field , to induce a true chiral influence .",
    "one may furthermore emphasize that enantioselection by falsely chiral influence is _ a priori _ not excluded in case of irreversible processes and more generally in far from equilibrium systems @xcite .      in the context of spin networks ,",
    "chirality is not a more evident concept .",
    "it covers , according to the relevant physical phenomena , basically distinct meanings , which are distinguished by specific names , vector chirality and scalar chirality , or may require more suitable explicit definitions . among all the variants ,",
    "the vector chirality is certainly the most intuitive , since it directly refers to the geometric image of a spin configuration , but at the same time it is subject to confusions and misconceptions .",
    "it is customary to conceive this chirality as a quantity that should indicate the sense of spin rotation when one is moving on oriented loops , typically on triangles or squares of spins , or along oriented lines , such as in helicoidal or cycloidal spin configurations .",
    "a generic variable answering this request is the spin twist or the chiral vector @xmath27 built over two consecutive spins @xmath28 and @xmath29 on an oriented link . according to the spin network and the spin configuration",
    "the spin twists must be possibly added over specific links , for instance over those of an oriented square , as the first time this chirality was invoked @xcite , or over those of an oriented triangle .",
    "the vector chirality associated with a triangle oriented by numbering its corners @xmath30 is thus generally given as @xmath31 @xmath32 is renormalized to get a variable that takes the values @xmath2 for a perfect triangular arrangement of the spins on the oriented triangle .",
    "it is clear that if the chirality is uniform then it is fully determined on a whole network through its average , either over all its oriented links or over all its oriented loops , otherwise one can have recourse to the fourier transform of the distribution of link or loop vector chiralities .",
    "one thus distinguishes for instance a ferrochiral spin arrangement ( chiral vector identical on all loops ) , which is macroscopically characterized by a uniform vector chirality , from an antiferrochiral spin arrangement ( chiral vector alternating from loop to loop ) , which is macroscopically characterized by a staggered vector chirality . in short ,",
    "whatever the spin network and the spin configuration , a rigorous definition of the vector chirality can be formulated by making use of the spin twist variables @xmath33 .",
    "the concept of vector chirality does not always meet the intuition of chirality we might forge from a purely geometric description of the spin configurations and their transformations by the ordinary space isometries . as to illustrate this , let us consider three typically encountered spin configurations showing a vector chirality :    - a magnetic helix , constituted of coplanar spins that rotate periodically about the perpendicular axis as one moves along it .",
    "one easily discerns two enantiomorphs interconverted by space inversion p. they are effectively associated with opposite vector chiralities , since the spins are rotating in opposite senses around the helix axis .",
    "the effect of p is impossible to produce with the time inversion t combined with a proper spatial rotation ( see figure [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "according to barron , this would describe a true chirality .",
    "the concept of vector chirality in this case fits with our geometric intuition .",
    "- a magnetic cycloid , constituted of coplanar spins that rotate periodically about the perpendicular axis as one moves along a specified axis parallel to the spin plane .",
    "one again discerns two enantiomorphs interconverted by space inversion p to which opposite vector chiralities are associated , but now these are also interconverted by the time inversion t combined with a 2-fold rotation . according to barron",
    ", this would describe a false chirality ( see figure [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "a magnetic cycloid moreover is a @xmath34-dimensional object which should be achiral in 3 dimensions . yet , one is still able to unambiguously assign a distinct vector chirality to each of the enantiomorphs .",
    "- a triangular configuration of coplanar spins oriented at 120@xmath35 from each other and distributed on the numbered corners of an equilateral triangle . under the space inversion",
    "p the triangle is reversed , but not the spins which are axial .",
    "one gets a distinct enantiomorph , but which again can be recovered by the time inversion t combined with a 2-fold rotation ( see figure [ fig:2 ] ) and thus would describe a false chirality .",
    "what is worse now is that the vector chirality is identical for both enantiomorphs .",
    "opposite vector chiralities are obtained solely by exchanging two spins out of three , which would suggest to consider the triangle not only as a geometric object but also as a graph .",
    "it is finally emphasized that once more the system should no longer be chiral in 3 dimensions and yet one is able to unambiguously distinguish the truly chiral spin configurations on the equilateral triangle with the help of the vector chirality @xmath32 .",
    "it is obvious from the above three examples that the concept of vector chirality does not always match with the immediate perception we might have of the spin configurations and with the definition of chirality discussed in section [ intro ] . as a matter of fact",
    ", the chiral vector can not describe a true chirality according to barron since it is not a pseudo - scalar .",
    "an helix however displays a true chirality because it can be characterized by the time - even pseudo scalar invariant @xmath36 @xcite . in the case of the cycloid , this quantity is zero and the only invariant that can be formed is of the type @xmath37 which is of the same nature as the vector chirality . with the triangular configuration of spins on a triangle ,",
    "neither the true nor the false chirality concepts of barron works since the parity does not connect the enantiomorphs of opposite vector chirality .",
    "what the inconsistencies of the naive description tells us is that the concept of vector chirality does not necessarily refer to the geometric inversion p , but to a more abstract transformation q that reverses the chiral vector from one enantiomorph to the other and forms with the identity q@xmath38 a group @xmath39 isomorphic to @xmath40 , similarly as @xmath41 .",
    "the transformation q differs from the parity p in a triangle of spins , which leads to a distinct q@xmath0chirality ( see figure [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the two transformations are identical in their effects on the spin configurations , for the magnetic helix and cycloid where it leads to respectively true and false chirality according to barron . in these cases",
    "the q@xmath0chirality coincide with p@xmath0chirality .",
    "the concept of vector chirality would loose any interest if it was only associated with an abstract transformation .",
    "it is actually supported by the fact that it can be given a concrete and intuitive meaning .",
    "a spin indeed is a physical quantity subject to dynamics and fluctuations driven by the interactions it experiences . with ( nearest neighbor )",
    "isotropic bilinear exchange interactions @xmath42 the equation of motion for the spin operator @xmath43 at the position @xmath44 writes @xmath45 which is nothing but the discretized form of the continuity equation for spin conservation , by interpreting the quantity @xmath46 as a * spin current * operator from the site @xmath44 to the site @xmath47.it has been argued that , for localized spins , it is only the spin current operator component @xmath48 perpendicular to the unit vector @xmath49 that effectively gives rise to an actual magnetization transport .",
    "it vanishes in the classical ground state or within a mean field approximation but not for quantum correlation @xcite . ]",
    "now it is clear that what makes up the vector chirality of a spin configuration is the spin current .",
    "it is observed that the spin current is intrinsically a @xmath50dimensional quantity , since it arises from a pair of necessarily non - collinear spins and is aligned along a direction that makes up a frame with the two spins from which it is built .",
    "it thus always defines a @xmath50dimensional chiral object whatever the dimension of the underlying network .",
    "although the q@xmath0chirality associated with the spin current @xmath51 can no longer be apprehended according to the barron s classification of true and false p@xmath0chirality , the dynamical aspects are still relevant since included in the equation of motion for the spins .",
    "the spin current is always t - even ( polar t - even as a graph variable and axial t - even as a vector product of two spin variables ) .",
    "the q@xmath0enantiomorphism in short should not be regarded as geometric but physical including the spin dynamics which is simultaneously time reversed .",
    "a series of microscopic mechanisms exist that might give rise to spin configurations displaying a finite vector chirality .",
    "a magnetic helix for instance can be induced from a ferromagnetic order by the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) antisymmetric interactions @xcite , in which case one generally expects that the pitch vector , which scales with the ratio of the dm coupling strength over the spin stiffness , should be of small amplitude , that is to say the spin configuration should show a long period .",
    "antisymmetric interactions such as the dm ones actually might induce a multitude of spin textures , cycloidal , conical , @xmath26 , or else skyrmionic @xcite .",
    "a magnetic helix might also be stabilized directly from the paramagnetic phase as an outcome of a competition between bilinear spin - spin exchange interactions @xcite or merely owing to a structural twist of exchange paths @xcite .",
    "an ingredient of utmost relevance is geometric frustration , which is at the origin of the triangular spin configuration on a triangle of spins with antiferromagnetic nearest neighbor interactions and gives rise for instance to either the uniform or the staggered vector chirality in the kagom network @xcite .",
    "it may lead to an extremely wide variety of collective spin states and excitations in an extended network , depending on the network connectivity and numerous second order interactions and mechanisms , more or less susceptible to raise the frustration induced macroscopic degeneracies @xcite .",
    "usually the encountered magnetic structures show domains of opposite vector chiralities in a same proportion so that no net vector chirality emerges macroscopically .",
    "magnetic chirality was for long observed as single domain only in the non - centrosymmetric itinerant helical magnet mnsi @xcite .",
    "a few other examples of non - centrosymmetric magnets exhibiting single domain vector chirality were later found out @xcite .",
    "it recently was brought to light that the vector chirality might play an important role in the field of multiferroism , where the spin current was identified as an essential ingredient of a possible mechanism of magneto - electric coupling @xcite . in this description ,",
    "the electric polarization produced between two spins @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the crystal is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 stands for the unit vector connecting the two spin positions .",
    "this opens opportunities to handle magnetic chirality / ferroelectric domains by means of electric and/or magnetic fields . as a matter of fact ,",
    "this had been experimentally demonstrated before @xcite .",
    "also promising is the electric handling of spin waves as a proposed route towards magnonics , a new way to carry and process information @xcite .",
    "this technological use of spin chirality is further highlighted by the present interest in the chiral character of magnetic objects in reduced dimensions ( surfaces , magnetic domain walls ... ) @xcite .",
    "chirality can also emanate from the quantum nature of the spin ensemble .",
    "an example is the soliton excitations in spin @xmath54 anisotropic chains @xcite , which has to do with the fact that the rotation group in spinor space is the double cover of the rotation group in ordinary space ( more intuitively a spin @xmath54 is invariant under a 4@xmath55rotation but is not under a 2@xmath55rotation ) . on",
    "can also mention the prediction of critical behaviors associated with a universality class specific to chirality @xcite that are actively investigated . at last but not the least",
    ", a coupling of chirality vectors might occur on its own to possibly induce novel spin phases , for instance spin gels associated with the binding of vortices formed of chirality vectors @xcite .",
    "all in all , a wealth of phenomena is inherent to the concept of the vector chirality , making up an extensive list which is constantly updated by new findings .",
    "chirality becomes further less intuitive when one is dealing with non coplanar magnetic structures all the more as the underlying network of spins can not itself be approximated in terms of weakly coupled chains or planes of spins .",
    "a quantity often invoked for non coplanar spins is scalar chirality , which is defined for consecutive spins along an oriented line or on an oriented loop as @xmath56 it is observed that this quantity , unlike the vector chirality , though still polar t - even as a graph variable , is now axial t - odd as the mixed product of three spin variables .",
    "scalar chirality is rather relevant of ( pt)@xmath0invariant physics , of which one of the exotic paradigm is provided by the anyon ensembles @xcite , which thus belong to the world of false chirality .",
    "it is inherent to the anomalous hall effect observed in geometrically frustrated magnets @xcite .",
    "it allows characterizing the magnetic nature of multi - spin order phases with zero on - site spin average and predicting possible associated non trivial charge dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is an essential ingredient of many avatars of chiral spin liquids bearing analogy with liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "scalar chirality can be interpreted to some extent as a measure for the solid angle between three spins , but can also be given other equivalent meanings @xcite .",
    "one of these is in terms of spin @xmath54 circulations and associated fluxes , through the spin transfer bond operators @xmath57 where @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) is meant for the creation ( annihilation ) of a spin state @xmath60 on the network node @xmath44 ( @xmath47 ) : @xmath61 for a triangle numbered @xmath30 .",
    "another invoked concept is the berry s phase @xmath62 associated with the cyclic transport of spin @xmath54 around a triangle numbered @xmath30 ( @xmath63 stands for the cyclic permutation operator and @xmath64 for a transposition ) : @xmath65 .",
    "0.2 cm    although further aspects of the scalar chirality and other concepts of magnetic chirality could be evoked we shall here stop this brief overview of chirality in magnetism , which was intended to precise its physical meanings and to give a glimpse at the wealth of phenomena accounted for by this concept .",
    "we shall now describe one technique specially well suited to probe it , more precisely the vector chirality .",
    "a moving neutron is a true chiral object , by its linear momentum which is a t - odd polar vector and its spin which is a t - odd axial vector .",
    "it is thus suited to probe the magnetic chiralities in the spin networks .",
    "one in fact makes use of a beam of neutrons in the actual experiments , that is to say a statistical ensemble , so that one handles a beam polarization rather than the spinor of individual moving neutrons .",
    "it is obvious that only a polarization dependent contribution to the neutron scattering might probe a magnetic chirality .",
    "it is shown that such a contribution exists indeed , which we shall call chiral scattering .",
    "it however does not provide with an immediate access to the vector chirality .",
    "in addition the neutron allows probing primarily pair correlation functions .",
    "chirality correlations , involving at least four spins , can be detected only indirectly . in order to specify these points more concretely",
    "we shall call back in what follows the general formulae of the intensity and polarization of the neutrons scattered out of a magnetic material , set up independently by blume and maleyev @xcite .",
    "we shall next briefly describe the methods of longitudinal and spherical neutron polarimetry to measure the chiral scattering @xcite and indicate to what extent this might be significant of static and possibly dynamic magnetic chirality .",
    "a targeted objective is the absolute determination of the chiral vectors .",
    "unfortunately , it appears that there is no universal convention for the definition of the scattering quantities on which a chirality might depend . according to the context , crystallography , x - ray scattering , elastic or inelastic neutron scattering , @xmath26",
    ", the plane waves may correspond to opposite wavevectors , the scattering vectors may differ in sign , @xmath26 , the geometry of the scattering is not always explicit , @xmath26 , which might lead to mistakes on the sign of the inferred chirality .",
    "we shall therefore begin with the basic concepts of the scattering theory , using the formulations implicitly adopted by blume @xcite :    an incoming neutron plane wave @xmath66 propagating along a wavevector @xmath67 is represented in space and time as @xmath68 an outgoing neutron scattered wave is asymptotically represented in space and time , that is to say far from the scatterer , as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the scattering amplitude .",
    "it follows that , for ingoing neutrons all in the state @xmath66 with kinetic energy @xmath71 , the number of neutrons in the spin state @xmath72 scattered per unit time within an infinitesimal solid angle @xmath73 along the unit vector @xmath74 at a kinetic energy within an infinitesimal range @xmath75 around @xmath76 is and a probability current @xmath77 are associated with every wavefunction @xmath78 .",
    "it follows that @xmath79 and @xmath80 for a plane wave @xmath81 whereas @xmath82 and @xmath83 for a spherical wave @xmath84 . ]",

    "the delta function @xmath90 ensures the energy conservation .",
    "dividing by the flux @xmath91 of the incoming neutrons one obtains a cross - section @xmath92 . statistically averaging over the initial states @xmath86 of the scatterer and the spin states @xmath93 of the incoming neutrons and summing over all the final states @xmath88 of the scatterer and the spin states @xmath94 of the outgoing neutrons ,",
    "the partial differential cross - section is written @xmath95 the statistical weight @xmath96 depends on the scatterer . at equilibrium",
    "it may for instance be the boltzmann factor : @xmath97 the statistical weight @xmath98 depends on the incoming neutron beam polarization @xmath99 : any operator @xmath100 in the spin space of an incoming neutron may be written as a linear combination @xmath101 of the unit operator @xmath102 and the pauli operators @xmath103 .",

    "there are three additional antiferromagnetic interactions , @xmath376 , @xmath377 , and @xmath378 , connecting the three atoms of one trimer to those of the superimposed trimers along the @xmath302-axis . due to the lack of inversion center , these 3 interactions are not equal ( different geometry of the exchange paths ) with , in particular , one diagonal interaction ( either @xmath376 or @xmath378 ) expected to be stronger than the other two ( _ i.e. _ @xmath379 max(@xmath377,@xmath378 ) or @xmath380 max(@xmath376,@xmath377 ) ) .",

    "if the diagonal interaction is twisted in the other sense , i.e. for the opposite structural chirality , the sense of rotation of the spins around the @xmath302 axis will be opposite . the helical chirality is thus related to the triangular chirality via the clockwise / anticlockwise torsion of the exchange paths along the @xmath302 axis resulting from the structural chirality .",

    "was also performed on the time - of - flight spectrometer in5 at the ill on the same single crystal at successive rotating angles around the vertical axis @xmath300 @xcite .    from unpolarized neutron scattering , as shown in figure [ fig:7 ] , we observed two spin - wave branches emerging from the @xmath294 magnetic satellites that form delicate arches , with different maximum energies ( @xmath3933.2 mev for the lower branch and @xmath3935 mev for the upper branch ) .",
    "one of the branches is gapped with a minimum at around 0.35  mev whereas the other branch might present a smaller gap of the order of 0.1  mev ( see figure [ fig:8 ] ) .",
    "the intensities of the excitations emerging from the two magnetic satellites are very different around certain reciprocal lattice nodes , for instance along the line ( 0 , -1 , @xmath394 ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the structural chirality as confirmed by spin waves calculations performed using the standard holstein - primakov formalism in the linear approximation with the software developed at the laboratoire lon brillouin by s. petit .",
    "a good agreement between experiment and calculation is achieved with the exchange parameters ( in mev ) @xmath395 , @xmath396 , @xmath397 , @xmath398 and @xmath399 , constrained to fulfill the @xmath386=1/7 conditions .",
    "an additional dm vector along @xmath302 of @xmath3931%@xmath400 was checked to produce the lower branch gap of @xmath3930.35 mev and to select a triangular chirality . in the calculated dynamical magnetic cross - section ,",
    "the asymmetric spectral weight of branches emerging from the + @xmath275 and -@xmath275 satellites is indeed inverted for opposite structural chiralities .",
    "even more interesting are the results obtained using neutron polarimetry . by extracting the chiral scattering contribution of the spin wave spectrum , we found that the lower mode is achiral whereas the upper mode has finite chirality ( see figure [ fig:9 ] ) .",
    "as shown section [ chiraldiff ] , the change of sign , from positive to negative , of the chiral scattering of the upper mode when @xmath394 becomes negative ( @xmath305 greater than @xmath401 in figure [ fig:3 ] ) is due to the fact that the neutron probes the moment component perpendicular to @xmath205 corresponding then to the projection of the fourier transformed dynamical chirality onto @xmath205 : @xmath320 for @xmath294 satellites with @xmath317 the helical chirality .",
    "this reflects a globally unchanged chirality of the upper spin wave branch over the whole energy spectrum . according to the calculations",
    ", this branch corresponds to correlation functions involving spin components along @xmath300 and @xmath301 , and only along @xmath302 for the lower branch .",
    "the latter yields a zero spin cross product and explains the absence of chiral scattering for the lower branch .",
    "the chiral scattering was also calculated and reproduces the measured one for the ( -1,+1 ) chiral ground state .",
    "note that the spin wave chiral scattering is distinct for the 4 possible chiral ground states , either in the intensity or in the sign of the branches emerging from the two satellites .",
    "it thus provides us with a strong fingerprint of the ground state chirality .",
    "our neutron polarimetry study of an enantiopure fe langasite crystal thus revealed the fully chiral scattering of the spin waves emerging from a ground state presenting a single domain magnetic triangular and helical chiralities .",
    "this unique observation is a manifestation of the intrinsic chirality of the spin waves , enabled by the absence of chirality mixing in the ground state of this non - centrosymmetric compound @xcite .",
    "the dynamical chiral scattering is in this case a strong fingerprint of the chiral ground state .",
    "further work is ongoing concerning the chiral character of the paramagnetic fluctuations .",
    "in conclusion , although not exhaustive , neutron scattering is a very useful probe of the magnetic chirality . the dynamical chiral scattering",
    "probes the time and space fourier transforms of the dynamical antisymmetric spin correlation function , involving the cross product of the fourier components of the magnetization perpendicular to the scattering vector . in the static case , this gives access to the projection onto the scattering vector of the chirality vector or spin current characterizing helical structures : helices or cycloids , and triangular spin arrangement described using a propagation vector . in the dynamical case , the intrinsic chirality of the spin waves can be accessed , whereas the experimental evidence of more exotic dynamical chirality , characteristic in particular of non ordered phases , is still an interesting challenge .    about the authors and acknowledgments : virginie simonet and rafik ballou are working in the field of frustrated magnetism and multiferroism in particular through neutron scattering studies . during the two phd works of k. marty ( post - doctoral position at spintec , grenoble , france ) and m. loire ( now teacher in a secondary school in nantes , france ) , they have been studying the chirality properties of a fe langasite compound .",

    "<S> we review the concept of chirality , at first briefly in a general context then in the specific framework of the spin networks . </S>",
    "<S> we next discuss to what extent neutron scattering appears as an unconvertible tool to probe magnetic chirality in the static and dynamical regimes of the spins . </S>",
    "<S> the remarkable chiral ground state and excitations of the fe@xmath0langasite compound finally serves to illustrate the use of neutron polarimetry in the experimental studies of the magnetic chirality . </S>"
