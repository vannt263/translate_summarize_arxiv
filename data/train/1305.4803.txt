    "use of the uniform distribution implies that the investigator only knows the possible ( or probable ) range of variation of the parameters , ignoring the internal structure of the uncertainty .",

    "the sensitivity of the extended model to the random variation of model parameters has been explored by running 16 independent simulations , each with a  different set of input parameters while keeping unchanged , and equal to the run performed with the original fixed - input trigrs model , the terrain morphology ( @xmath19 ) and rainfall history .",

    "storms that trigger shallow landslides in seattle are generally of long duration ( more than 24h ) and of moderate intensity @xcite .",
    "three geological units crop out in the area @xcite ( figure  [ fig03]a ) including , from older to younger : ( i ) transition sediments , comprising the lawton clay ( qtb ) , ( ii ) advance outwash sand ( qva ) , and ( iii ) glacial till ( qvt ) .",

    "the result confirms that adoption of a  probabilistic framework to the distributed modeling of shallow landslides results in improved spatial forecasts .",
    "the result further corroborates the finding that modeling the natural uncertainty ( and poor understanding ) of the mechanical and hydrological variables results in better spatial landslide predictions of the locations of rainfall - induced landslides ( see insets in figure  [ fig04 ] ) .",
    "first , the tpr , fpr , ppv , and auc metrics did not change significantly when the range of variation @xmath216 of the model parameters was changed .",
    "these metrics remained similar to the values obtained with the fixed input model , confirming     -2 cm    that they are not sensitive to differences between probabilistic framework runs with random variations of parameters and runs with fixed parameters .",
    "second , the area under the roc curve auc confirmed its positive correlation with the range of variation in the model parameters @xmath216 , in support of the probabilistic approach .",
    "third , the positive correlation between the range of variation @xmath216 and the fraction of unconditionally unstable cells , and the negative correlation between the shift in the mean value of the modeling parameters @xmath180 and the fraction of unconditionally unstable cells , were both confirmed .",

    "the maps showing the geographical distribution of the factor of safety @xmath15 obtained using trigrs - p were better predictors of the distributions of known rainfall - induced landslides than the corresponding maps obtained adopting the original trigrs approach .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the indices used to measure the forecasting skills of the different models , and particularly the area under the roc , auc ( tables  [ tab02][tab04 ] for mukilteo , and table  [ tab06 ] , [ tab07 ] , [ tab08 ] for frontignano ) .",
    "the runs in which we allowed a  large variability of the input parameters ( e.g. @xmath217 or @xmath208 ) were better predictors of the geographical distribution of known landslides than the models prepared using a  reduced variability in the model parameters ( e.g. @xmath218 ) @xcite .",
    "this is shown in the insets in figure  [ fig04 ] , where a  portion of the results for the mukilteo study area is shown at a  larger scale .",
    "the variability of the geographical distribution of the @xmath15 is also shown in figure  [ fig12 ] where we have plotted the minimum , the maximum , and the standard deviation of the computed @xmath15 values . in particular , the map of the standard deviation provides quantitative and spatially distributed evidence of the uncertainty associated with the distributed modeling of landslide instability .",
    "we studied the variation of the computed factor of safety .",
    "figure  [ fig13 ] shows histograms for the distribution of the values of the factor of safety @xmath15 in selected grid cells in the mukilteo ( figure  [ fig13]a  c ) and the frontignano ( figure  [ fig13]d  f ) study areas . for simplicity , in the figure we show the results obtained for a  single lithological type i.e. , the transition sediments ( qtb , indicated as unit @xmath104 in table  [ tab01 ] ) in the mukilteo area ( figure  [ fig03]a ) , and the sand - silt - clay ( unit  5 in table  [ tab05 ] ) in the frontignano area ( figure  [ fig08]a ) .",

    "we adopted the following procedure to obtain the histograms .",
    "first , we performed @xmath219 probabilistic simulations to obtain a  large set of values of the factor of safety @xmath15 , and we computed the average value of the factor of safety , @xmath220 for each grid cell in the two modeling domains . for both study areas , a  value of @xmath221 ( and @xmath222 ) was used for the variability of the geotechnical and hydrological parameters .",
    "next , we selected three subsets of 1000  grid cells , with @xmath204 , @xmath223 , and @xmath206 , respectively . finally , we used all the computed values of the @xmath15 in each subset to construct the histograms .",
    "inspection of the histograms reveals that for @xmath206 ( figure  [ fig13]c ,  f ) the distribution of the predicted factor of safety is almost uniform and does not show a  predominant value . instead , for @xmath224 the distribution of the predicted factors of safety peaks at @xmath225 ( figure  [ fig13]a ,  d ) . for @xmath226 ,",
    "results are intermediate ( figure  [ fig13]b ,  e ) .    in conclusion , the probabilistic approach results in a  number of model outputs , each representing the geographical distribution of the @xmath15 values .",

    "adoption of a  probabilistic - initiated framework allowed the investigation of the sensitivity of the model used to determine the stability conditions to the geotechnical and hydrological properties of the terrains where landslides can develop . the observed sensitivity was attributed to the combined effect of the natural variability inherent to the geotechnical and hydrological properties of the slope materials , and to the fact that the numerical model is an approximate representation of the complex processes controlling rainfall - induced slope instability in an area .",

    "<S> an infiltration model is used to determine how rainfall changes pore - water conditions , modulating the local stability / instability conditions . a  problem with the operation of the existing models lays in the difficulty in obtaining accurate values for the several variables that describe the material properties of the slopes . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is particularly severe when the models are applied over large areas , for which sufficient information on the geotechnical and hydrological conditions of the slopes is not generally available . to help solve the problem </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a  probabilistic monte carlo approach to the distributed modeling of rainfall - induced shallow landslides . </S>",
    "<S> for the purpose , we have modified the transient rainfall infiltration and grid - based regional slope - stability analysis ( trigrs ) code . </S>",

    "<S> both saturated and unsaturated soil conditions can be considered . </S>",
    "<S> trigrs - p copes with the natural variability inherent to the mechanical and hydrological properties of the slope materials by allowing values of the trigrs model input parameters to be sampled randomly from a  given probability distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the range of variation and the mean value of the parameters can be determined by the usual methods used for preparing the trigrs input parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the outputs of several model runs obtained varying the input parameters are analyzed statistically , and compared to the original ( deterministic ) model output . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison suggests an improvement of the predictive power of the model of about 10 and 16 in two small test areas i.e. , i.e. , the frontignano ( italy ) and the mukilteo ( usa ) areas . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the computational requirements of trigrs - p to determine the potential use of the numerical model to forecast the spatial and temporal occurrence of rainfall - induced shallow landslides in very large areas , extending for several hundreds or thousands of square kilometers . </S>",

    "<S> the fact that these parameters are constant in time is an assumption of the model . </S>",

    "<S> the various models adopt different physically - based models , which are not equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> we maintain that the probabilistic approach of the modified version of trigrs is relevant , because it considers most of the aspects relevant to slope stability analysis , and it is capable of reproducing empirical properties of rainfall - induced shallow landslides , including the rainfall intensity - duration conditions that generate the slope instabilities , and the statistics of the size of the unstable areas , as recently shown by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows . </S>",
    "<S> first , we summarize the model adopted in the software code trigrs , version 2.0 @xcite , and we introduce our probabilistic extension ( sect .  </S>",

    "<S> next , we present a  comparison of the performance of the original and the probabilistic simulations for two study areas : mukilteo , usa , and frontignano , italy ( sect .  [ </S>",
    "<S> sec : model_res ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> results are discussed in sect .  </S>",
    "<S> [ discussion ] , which focuses on the analysis of the performance of the geographical prediction of the shallow landslides , and on the potential application of the new probabilistic code for modeling shallow rainfall - induced landslides over large areas ( @xmath14100 ) . </S>"
