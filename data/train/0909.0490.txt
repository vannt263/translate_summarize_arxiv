    "in recent years the idea of exploring the possibility of the gravitational interaction acting in more than 4-dimensions ( 4d ) attracted a lot of attention .",
    "in particular , one of the simplest such models arises from the curved generalization of the one - brane randall - sundrum model @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) , where gravity acts in 5-dimensions ( 5d ) , however standard model fields are confined to the 4d brane .",
    "nonstandard model fields can occur in the 5d space - time .",
    "a @xmath0-symmetric embedding looks natural only if the brane is envisaged as a boundary ; otherwise generic asymmetric embeddings should be allowed .",
    "the generic dynamics was given in refs .",
    "@xcite and varbranetension in a 5d - covariant approach . although promising at the level of allowing new degrees of freedom , which seem to be adjustable to explain for example dark matter @xcite-@xcite , the complexity of the brane - world dynamics also represents a major impediment in obtaining simple exact solutions or in monitoring the evolution of perturbations . therefore new approaches to gravitational dynamics in brane - worlds",
    "are worth to study .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the 5d space - time was foliated first by a family of 4d space - times and a second family of 4d space - like hypersurfaces ( see fig 1 . in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . such an 5d space - time is _",
    "double foliable_. this structure of the 5d space - time allowed to describe the gravitational degrees of freedom in terms of tensorial , vectorial and scalar quantities with respect to the 3-space emerging as the intersection of the two hypersurfaces .",
    "they represent the gravitons , a gravi - photon , and a gravi - scalar and are given by quantities with well - defined geometrical meaning , namely the tensorial , vectorial and scalar projections of the spatial 4d metric and their canonically conjugated momenta : the extrinsic curvature ( second fundamental form of the 3-spaces with respect to the temporal normal ) , normal fundamental form and normal fundamental scalar .",
    "the evolution equations for these variables were given  la adm both on the brane and outside it .",
    "an extension of this formalism towards a full hamiltonian description was advanced in ref .",
    "it has been shown , that among all gravitational variables on the brane , only the momentum of the gravi - vector has a jump across the brane , related to the energy transport ( heat flow ) on the brane .    the formalism presented in refs",
    "@xcite-@xcite however is not straightforward to be applied in brane cosmology",
    ". a formal difference would be the definition of the time derivative . in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite this was defined in the tradition of canonical gravity as a lie - derivative taken along the temporal direction ( which is not necessarily orthogonal to the 3-space ) projected to the 3-space , whereas in cosmology by tradition the time derivative is defined as a covariant derivative along the normal to the 3-surfaces ( this derivative happens to enter only in expressions projected onto the 3-space ) .",
    "obviously this mismatch in the definitions of the time derivatives is not crucial , as the two definitions differ only in terms taken on the 3-space .",
    "however the formalism developed in refs . @xcite and @xcite relying on the double foliability of the 5d space - time is unable to deal with the possible _ vorticity of the word - lines of observers_.    in this paper we develop a formalism overcoming this inconvenience and derive the full set of evolution and constraint equations governing gravitational dynamics in a 3 + 1 + 1 covariant form . provided the space - like normal @xmath1 has vanishing vorticity on a hypersurface ( the time evolution vector can still have vorticity ) , the formalism becomes suitable for describing gravitational dynamics on the brane ( then @xmath1 becomes the brane normal ) . in this sense",
    "the formalism is a generalization of the brane 3 + 1 covariant cosmology @xcite ( which in turn is a generalization of the general relativistic 3 + 1 covariant cosmology @xcite - bonometto ) .",
    "this newly developed formalism also generalizes the s+1 + 1 covariant brane - world dynamics developed in ref .",
    "both the vector field @xmath2 and the time evolution vector @xmath3 are allowed to have vorticity in the present formalism .",
    "though observational evidence suggest that the directly detectable 3 + 1 part of the universe is best described by a friedmann brane with perfect fluid , when discussing cosmological perturbations , the vorticity of @xmath3 should be allowed , similarly as in existing formalisms of covariant cosmology in both general relativity and brane - worlds .",
    "we can also argue for the need of keeping the vorticity of @xmath1 .",
    "one reason would be , that if it is vanishing at some initial instant , it should stay zero ; and the formalism should be able to handle its `` evolution '' . secondly , and more important , the vorticity of @xmath1 should not necessarily vanish at other locations , than the brane , a gauge freedom worth to explore .",
    "we note that a lower - dimensional , 2 + 1 + 1 formalism was developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and applied in the general relativistic covariant perturbations of schwarzschild black holes and rotationally symmetric space - time ; then for investigating spherically symmetric static solutions in @xmath4 gravity theories in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in general relativity",
    "the important topic of cosmological perturbations , related to both the cosmic microwave background and structure formation , has a rich literature , from which ( without claiming completeness ) we mention refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite , all based on the 3 + 1 covariant approach .",
    "brane - world cosmological perturbations are equally important , however additional difficulties emerge due to the complexity of brane - world theory and the impediment to predict and perform observations on the brane . at a technical level ,",
    "the latter is obstructed by the lack of closure of the perturbation equations on the brane . despite impressive developments mukohyamamaster-@xcite",
    ", many questions remain unanswered .",
