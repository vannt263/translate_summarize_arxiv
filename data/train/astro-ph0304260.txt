    "transient astronomical electromagnetic radiation is the signature of some of the most fascinating physical phenomena in the universe .",
    "anywhere the physical conditions change with time , there is the potential for transient radiation .",
    "the detection of transient astronomical radiation presents challenges not encountered in observations of persistent sources .",
    "sources which produce radiation sporadically can not easily be studied with typical observatories and their schedules of observing time allocation ; other techniques are required .",
    "detecting transient astronomical signals at radio wavelengths in particular requires overcoming an even greater difficulty : the pervasive presence of radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "the ever growing use of wireless services means the radio spectrum is crowded with a wide variety of signals , a large fraction of which are transient .",
    "since it is the very nature of transient signals of terrestrial or astronomical origin to disappear unpredictably , they can not reliably be distinguished from each other by repeated observing .",
    "surveyors for transient astronomical radio signals must devise other methods to separate the desired astronomical signals from the seemingly ubiquitous rfi .",
    "we describe here the survey for transient astronomical radio emission ( stare ) , a system for detecting transient astronomical radio signals .",
    "sensitive to transient radio signals at 611mhz@xmath0 on time scales of 0.125s@xmath1 to a few minutes , stare rejects rfi by requiring simultaneous observation of signals at three geographically separated sites .",
    "many sources have been observed to produce transient astronomical radio emission .",
    "perhaps the most familiar is the sun , from which a large variety of transient radio signals emanate . from microwave spike bursts lasting @xmath3 to type  iii storms lasting weeks",
    ", the characteristics of solar radio bursts span wide ranges of brightness temperature , duration , frequency , and polarization .",
    "associated with many different aspects of solar activity , the mechanisms producing the bursts run the gamut , from thermal bremsstrahlung to plasma radiation . @xcite and @xcite",
    "provide reviews .",
    "other stars have been seen to produce radio bursts as well .",
    "events observed on flare stars are similar in character to those seen on the sun , but imply radio luminosities @xmath4 times that of solar flares @xcite .",
    "rs  cvn systems , close binaries with orbital periods of @xmath530days@xmath6 , have been observed to produce transient radio emission on time scales of minutes to days .",
    "the signals are thought to be due to two separate phenomena : the acceleration of electrons in the magnetic fields between the stars , and coherent emission from the individual stars @xcite .",
    "x - ray binaries as well are known to produce transient radio signals following x - ray events , although the mechanism in this case is thought to be quite different from that of the rs  cvn binaries @xcite .",
    "jupiter was discovered many years ago to produce transient radio emission at decameter wavelengths @xcite , thought to be due to synchrotron radiation from high - energy electrons trapped in the magnetic field of the planet .",
    "details are reviewed in @xcite .",
    "brown dwarfs have been seen to flare in the radio : a recent vla observation of a such a flare measured a flux density much higher than that expected from an empirical relation between the luminosities of brown dwarf radio flares and x - ray flares @xcite .",
    "some radio pulsars are observed occasionally to produce `` giant pulses . '' for example , about 0.3% of the pulses from the crab pulsar have amplitudes greater than 1000 times the average pulse height @xcite .",
    "high - energy cosmic rays can cause transient radio signals at the surface of the earth .",
    "the interaction of high - energy particles from space and the earth s atmosphere produces an `` extensive air shower . ''",
    "pair production in the shower creates populations of electrons and positrons which are systematically separated by the magnetic field of the earth , setting up a current which produces a radio pulse @xcite .",
    "these are only a few examples of known sources of transient astronomical radio emission .",
    "other sources have been postulated , but not observed , to produce short radio pulses .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite have predicted that a type  i supernova should radiate an electromagnetic pulse at radio frequencies : during the collapse , the expanding envelope of the white dwarf acts as a `` conducting piston , '' compressing the transverse magnetic field , thus producing a short pulse of radio emission .",
    "efforts to detect such pulses are described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another example is `` exploding '' black holes , predicted by @xcite : the decrease in black hole mass due to quantum radiation causes an increase in surface gravity , which in turn increases the emission rate .",
    "black holes near the ends of of their lives would radiate intensely , releasing @xmath7 in the last 0.1s@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite has speculated that the expanding sphere of electrons and positrons would act like the conducting piston described by colgate for supernovas , similarly producing a short radio pulse . @xcite and @xcite have reported unsuccessful searches for these pulses .    of particular interest for radio transient searches is the association between high - energy emission and radio emission .",
    "@xcite reports searching the cgro / egret phase  1 full - sky survey for gamma - ray emission from x - ray selected bl  lac objects and from the 200 brightest radio - quiet quasars .",
    "none was detected , while egret did detect @xmath8 radio - loud quasars and radio - selected bl  lacs .",
    "this seems to suggest that `` apparent gamma - ray emission is intimately linked to apparent radio - emission , '' @xcite which is perhaps not surprising since the conditions which produce high - energy emission ( relativistic particles ) , in the presence of even a weak magnetic field , produce radio emission through the synchrotron mechanism .",
    "this association has been noticed by others as well ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the presence or absence of radio emission from high - energy sources can yield clues about their workings .",
    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have been observed to produce emission at longer wavelengths following the gamma - ray event ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these so - called afterglows were first detected at radio wavelengths in the grb of 1997  may  08 @xcite , and the field has since matured such that a catalog of radio afterglows is possible @xcite .",
    "the afterglows are believed to be due to emission from shocks produced when a relativistic fireball interacts with an ambient medium ( @xcite reviews models ) .",
    "another possibility , which has not been detected , is a prompt radio burst associated with the grb event itself .",
    "again , energetic charged particles in a magnetic field might serve as a source ; for example , @xcite suggest that strong low - frequency radio emission might be generated by time variability in the current sheath surrounding a magnetized jet . examples of other ideas relevant to the detection of prompt radio emission from grbs may be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "energetic particles can produce radio emission under other conditions as well .",
    "it was suggested some time ago @xcite that high energy neutrinos and cosmic rays would generate coherent cerenkov emission as they travel through a dense dielectric medium such as water , ice , the earth , or the moon .",
    "the physical process is similar to that of the extensive air shower discussed earlier , involving the production of a shower with an imbalance of charge .",
    "the spectrum of cerenkov light from such an event would be very broad , including radio and optical emission .",
    "the generation of coherent radio bursts has been verified in accelerator experiments @xcite .",
    "the pulses generated by particles traveling through the lunar regolith are expected to be very bright and very short : more than thousands of janskies for the highest energy particles , with durations on the order of a nanosecond @xcite .",
    "@xcite report an unsuccessful search for such emission .",
    "experiments to detect transient astronomical radiation at radio wavelengths have traditionally followed one of two approaches .",
    "when transient radio emission is thought to originate from a particular source or region of the sky , a high - gain , small solid - angle approach is used .",
    "a high - gain radio telescope pointed at the region of interest provides good sensitivity and rejection of signals outside the region .",
    "when the location of the source of radiation is unknown , a low - gain , large solid - angle approach is more appropriate .",
    "radio telescopes with large beams provide coverage of large fractions of the sky , but at the cost of reduced sensitivity , since the angular extent of any discrete source is likely to be much smaller than the telescope beam .",
    "some good examples of the high - gain , small solid - angle approach are those which were prompted in the early 1970s by weber s reports of detections of pulses of gravitational radiation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "since the gravitational waves were reported to have originated from the galactic center , attempts to detect radio frequency activity focused on that region .",
    "@xcite monitored the galactic center with two radiometers separated by 100km@xmath9 .",
    "the first , at 16ghz@xmath10 , provided a beamwidth of @xmath11 , sensitivity @xmath12 , and response time @xmath13 .",
    "the other , at @xmath14 , provided beamwidth @xmath15 , sensitivity @xmath16 , and response time @xmath17 .",
    "astronomical events were to be identified by their simultaneous appearance in the records at both sites .",
    "after 90  hours of monitoring , they detected no coincidences .",
    "@xcite observed the galactic center at 858mhz@xmath0 with beamwidth @xmath18 , sensitivity 85jy@xmath19 , and response time @xmath20 . in 207  hours of monitoring the galactic center",
    ", they report 97 detections of pulses . however , their interference rejection scheme is unclear , making uncertain their conclusion of the existence of discrete radio pulses from the galactic center .",
    "@xcite used the mount hopkins observatory 10-meter optical reflector ( which was fitted with two outboard 4.6-meter radio reflectors ) to make a more general search including the galactic center , the coma cluster of galaxies , and the andromeda galaxy at three radio frequencies and one optical frequency . in approximately 200  hours of observing , they detected no events of extraterrestrial origin , which were to be identified by the differences in pulse arrival times among frequencies , due to dispersion by the interstellar medium .",
    "other work has attempted to observe a much larger fraction of the sky with lower sensitivity .",
    "for example , @xcite assembled a system of five receiving stations in great britain and ireland with station separations ranging from 110km@xmath9 to 500km@xmath9 .",
    "each station had similar receiving systems at 151mhz@xmath0 , consisting of two half - wave dipole antennas operating as phase - switched interferometers , and receivers with sensitivities of @xmath21 and response times of @xmath22 .",
    "interference rejection was accomplished by requirement of five - fold coincidence .",
    "after @xmath23  hours of observations , they detected no events .",
    "@xcite used four receiving systems at medicina ( bologna , italy ) operating at at 151 , 323.5 , 330.5 and 408mhz@xmath0 . on 16  august  1976 all four instruments detected a radio burst , while sixty seconds earlier , a gamma - ray burst was detected by three satellites and one balloon - borne detector .",
    "strong rejection of local interference was provided by an independent observation made at 237mhz@xmath0 at the astronomical observatory of trieste ( 400km@xmath9 distant from medicina ) .",
    "the investigators estimated the probability of a random coincidence between the five - fold radio event and the gamma - ray burst at @xmath24 . using geometric arguments , they localized the radio burst to a region on the sky . unfortunately , later work on the gamma - ray burst data from the balloon - borne detector @xcite produced a position for the gamma - ray event which was well outside the radio emission error box , apparently ruling out a common origin for the gamma - ray and radio events .",
    "but the possibility remains that the radio event was astronomical in origin .",
    "@xcite used two receiving systems separated by several hundred kilometers to monitor the sky at 270mhz@xmath0 .",
    "each station consisted of a helical antenna with beam area @xmath25 centered on the north celestial pole , and a multi - channel receiver which provided a sensitivity of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the data were displayed with response times @xmath28 to @xmath20 on an oscilloscope , and recorded by continuously photographing the oscilloscope screen .",
    "interference was rejected by requiring coincidence between sites , and by examining for the frequency dispersion expected in extraterrestrial signals due to the interstellar plasma . in 213  hours of observing",
    ", they detected no events .",
    "@xcite constructed the molonglo observatory transient event recorder ( moter ) , which operated at 843mhz@xmath0 in parallel with normal molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) synthesis observations .",
    "this system used 32 total - power fan beams spaced at full beamwidth intervals of @xmath29 . when a transient event with flux density and duration @xmath30 to @xmath31 occurred in the field of view , moter compared the signals in the fan beams .",
    "sources closer than about 3000km@xmath9 were significantly out of focus , and thus appeared in many beams simultaneously , while signals appearing in one beam only were thought to be due to random noise . in this way moter was able to reject signals of local origin .",
    "a signal which was not rejected was localized to an arc segment on the sky corresponding to the fan beam in which its maximum appeared . over a full synthesis observation , the resulting ensemble of arc segments intersected at a point , the location of the source .",
    "while moter lacked instantaneous large solid - angle coverage , in time much of the southern sky was surveyed . in @xmath32 of observations , amy , large , &",
    "vaughan detected only previously known pulsars .",
    "we describe here a large solid - angle , low - gain system for detecting transient astronomical radio emission at 611mhz@xmath0 on time scales of a few minutes or less .",
    "similar in spirit to the work of @xcite and @xcite , stare updates previous efforts through the use of modern technology .",
    "the wide availability of fast computers and other hardware permits the collection of data in digital form .",
    "such a data record makes possible a variety of analyses both during data collection and afterward , presenting a greater opportunity for discovery than the data sets from the 1970s which were generally in the form of analog chart records .",
    "stare was designed to be simple and inexpensive , and was intended to be a first look which might eventually foster further work with new instrumentation .",
    "the system operates at a frequency of 611mhz@xmath0 in a bandwidth of 4mhz@xmath0 , corresponding to a frequency band protected in the united states for radio astronomy ; if not protected , this band would contain the signal for channel  37 in the uhf television spectrum .",
    "scientific arguments fail to indicate a clear choice of observing frequency : at higher frequencies , optically thick sources are brighter , while at lower frequencies , optically thin nonthermal processes radiate more intensely . too low , however , and the sky brightness temperature becomes prohibitive .",
    "the choice of 611mhz@xmath0 was a compromise among these considerations , bolstered by technical factors such as the relative ease and low cost of constructing radio astronomy apparatus for this frequency range , and the existence of a protected band for astronomy .",
    "the stare system consists of detectors at three geographically separated sites : one at the vlba station in hancock , new  hampshire , another at the vlba station in north  liberty , iowa , and the third at nrao in green  bank , west  virginia .",
    "the sites are close enough that they see the same part of the sky , while they are distant enough so that radio frequency interference at one of the sites ( from terrestrial or low - altitude transmitters ) will not be detected at the others .",
    "this provides a powerful filter for selecting signals of celestial origin : any signal which does not appear simultaneously at all three sites is rejected .",
    "these locations were chosen because they all have operating radio telescopes and so are expected to have low levels of rfi , and because nrao was kindly willing to support stare operations .",
    "the stare instruments are highly self - sufficient , requiring only a standard ac electrical power connection , an internet connection , space for the antennas and electronics , and a staff member willing to perform occasional minor crisis intervention .",
    "the apparatus at a site consists of several systems : an analog receiving system , a global positioning system receiver for providing accurate time , and a pc which collects data and controls everything at the site .",
    "the entire system is overseen by a workstation at mit , which is also where the data are archived .",
    "figure  [ fig : systemorg ] shows the organization of the entire system .    the analog receiving systems each consist of an antenna , a receiver , and a detector .",
    "the antennas are of the `` crossed - dipoles in a cavity '' type , shown schematically in figure  [ fig : antennapicture ] .",
    "this style of antenna provides broad sky coverage , although at the expense of sensitivity .",
    "laboratory measurements ( by j.  barrett , p.  mcmahon , and w.  baumgartner ) on a scale model of the antennas found a broad beam with effective solid angle 1.4sr@xmath33 , yielding a sensitivity of @xmath34 .",
    "the receivers are dual - channel superheterodyne total - power radiometers , and are each divided between a front end which is outdoors attached to the antenna , and a back end which is indoors .",
    "the front end begins with low - noise ambient temperature preamplifiers @xcite with effective noise temperatures in the range 100 - 150k@xmath35 .",
    "the front end also includes a laboratory - calibrated noise source for gain calibration and system temperature measurements .",
    "the back end performs bandpass filtering , further amplification , frequency downconversion , square - law detection , and anti - alias filtering at 25khz@xmath36 .",
    "the analog receiving systems were designed to provide sensitivity to the two orthogonal circular polarizations , with beam patterns independent of source azimuth . however , due to an error in the construction of the feeds , they receive two orthogonal elliptical polarizations , which vary with source azimuth .",
    "we avoid this problem by summing the two received polarizations .",
    "it can be shown @xcite , and is evident from symmetry , that the orthogonality of the received elliptical polarizations means that their sum is independent of the azimuth of the source .",
    "thus in practice we are able to calibrate only the sum of the total power in both polarizations .    in order to reject local interference , we must be able to determine simultaneity from site to site , requiring an accurate timekeeping method .",
    "this is provided by the global positioning system ( gps ) . at each stare site",
    "is a gps antenna and receiver .",
    "when initially installed , each gps system was allowed to compute its position continuously for several days .",
    "the data were then suitably averaged to increase the accuracy of the position determinations . those positions were then programmed into the gps systems , allowing four satellites to be used for timekeeping alone . in this `` static timing mode , '' the gps receivers have a claimed timing accuracy of @xmath37 .",
    "data acquisition and all other activity at each site are controlled by a standard desktop pc .",
    "the filtered square - law detector outputs are digitized at 50khz@xmath36 by a 12-bit analog - to - digital converter card which is clocked by a 100khz@xmath36 signal from the gps receiver .",
    "timestamps are assigned to the data by switching in a short pulse from the gps receiver and finding the sample during which the pulse is detected , yielding a timestamp accuracy of 20s@xmath38 .",
    "the samples are boxcar integrated , then collected and saved on the disk for some specified period , then are transferred to a workstation at mit .",
    "in addition to performing overall coordination and data archiving , the workstation is responsible for the data analysis : the data files from each site are analyzed individually to produce a record of transient radio signals there .",
    "the site event records are then compared to find three - way coincidences .",
    "the entire stare system runs automatically , producing a daily report of site events and coincidence detections .",
    "the computer systems are set up so that most routine maintenance can be performed without travelling to the sites .",
    "the system is quite robust , having required human attention on average less than once a month .",
    "sometimes attention is necessary to clear a fault condition , but most often routine maintenance ( e.g. clearing a full disk ) is the cause .",
    "occasionally a phone call to a site is necessary ( e.g. to identify and replace an electrical fuse blown during an electrical storm ) .    in normal operation",
    ", the power received by each antenna at 611mhz@xmath0 in 4mhz@xmath0 bandwidth and two polarizations is boxcar averaged for 0.125s@xmath1 and recorded .",
    "every 15min@xmath39 , the noise source in the front end is switched on for 2s@xmath1 , to provide receiver gain calibration .",
    "each hour , the data from the previous hour are uploaded to the workstation at mit , where they are processed and archived .",
    "coincidences among sites are detected by the simplest possible method : the records of each site are examined to find events at that location , then the lists of single - site events are compared to find instances where all three sites recorded events simultaneously . note that with this simple scheme , the overall sensitivity to three - way coincidences is determined by the site with the poorest detection sensitivity .",
    "if one site fails to detect an event , the event can not be identified as a three - way coincidence .",
    "more sophisticated schemes could no doubt produce better detection sensitivity .",
    "the first step , the detection of events at each site individually , is performed using a two - pass sliding - window baseline fit . on the first pass ,",
    "a quadratic model is fit to the data in a 240s@xmath1 window using a least - squares algorithm , and the dispersion @xmath40 of the data around this fit is calculated . on the second pass ,",
    "the model is again fit to the data in the 240s@xmath1 window , this time using the robust estimation method described by @xcite ,  15.7 .",
    "we implemented the method with a lorentzian weighting distribution with the width set to the dispersion @xmath40 calculated in the first pass .",
    "this method was chosen so that we could follow the wandering baseline in the data without our fit being skewed by outlier points , of which there are many , including the transient signals we are trying to detect .",
    "note that this results in a loss of sensitivity to events longer than a few minutes .",
    "greater sensitivity to long - lived events could be achieved by increasing the width of this boxcar averaging window , at the expense of reducing the baseline - removal effectiveness for shorter time periods .",
    "once the baseline fit is determined , the data are examined for samples which deviate from the baseline by more than some threshold specified as a multiple of @xmath40 .",
    "when a sample is seen to deviate by more than the threshold , an event is considered to be in progress , and the next sample is examined .",
    "this continues until the deviation falls below one - half of the threshold , at which time the event is considered to have ended .",
    "we use this adaptive threshold to reduce the incidence of long , temporally spiky events being broken up into multiple events as the flux density level varies around the threshold .",
    "once the events are detected , they are classified as `` single - point '' or `` multi - point , '' depending on whether the thresholds were exceeded only in a single sample ( i.e. event duration @xmath41 ) , or in more than one consecutive sample .    the thresholds for event detection",
    "were chosen so that from site to site , the flux density required to trigger an event is about the same . using receiver noise temperature @xmath42 , zenith antenna sensitivity @xmath43 , integration time @xmath44 , and bandwidth @xmath45 , we calculate a theoretical zenith flux density sensitivity for our systems of about 4kjy@xmath2 .",
    "of course in practice the system temperatures are higher than the receiver temperatures because our @xmath46 beam admits rfi from sources far and wide , degrading the system sensitivity .",
    "we found that the system temperatures also vary widely with time . at green  bank and north  liberty ,",
    "the median system temperatures through 18  months of observations were similar at about @xmath47 . at hancock , the system temperatures were typically higher by a factor of 2 . to make the zenith flux density sensitivities consistent from site to site , we chose a threshold of @xmath48 for transient detection at green  bank and north  liberty , and @xmath49 at hancock .",
    "these thresholds correspond to a zenith flux density triggering threshold of about @xmath50 . for sources away from zenith , the threshold is of course higher due to the decrease in antenna gain .",
    "once the single - site event lists are produced , they are compared to find events detected simultaneously at all three sites . three - way coincidences are classified as `` single - point '' if the three single - site events are all single - point events , `` multi - point '' if they are all multi - point events , and `` mixed - type '' if the simultaneous single - site events are a combination of single - point and multi - point . to assess the coincidence detection sensitivity of stare , we examined the flux density sensitivity at each site for every minute of time that all three sites were on - line .",
    "we then chose the poorest sensitivity of the three as the stare coincidence sensitivity , since the site with the poorest sensitivity would determine the overall sensitivity .",
    "the results are shown in a normalized histogram in figure  [ figure : coincidencesensitivity ] .",
    "not shown are the 5.6% of the values which lie beyond the right side of the plot , due to noisy times at one or more of the sites .",
    "the median overall stare zenith sensitivity of 26.7kjy@xmath2 is very close to the median single - site detection sensitivity of 26kjy@xmath2 , indicating that most of the time , the three sites run with comparable sensitivities .",
    "event data were calibrated in several steps .",
    "first , the receiver gains were determined using the noise source on / off data .",
    "these were used to convert the data to antenna temperatures in each polarization channel .",
    "the antenna temperatures were summed to find the total antenna temperature , and to avoid the problem with the unknown polarizations of the feeds ( see the discussion of the analog receiving systems in  [ subsection : apparatus ] ) .",
    "then , using the antenna sensitivity determined from measurements on a scale model of the antennas , the antenna temperatures were converted to the flux densities that would be measured if the source were at the zenith .",
    "this resulted in a lower limit on the flux density of the source . for sources of known elevation , such as the sun",
    ", the zenith flux densities were corrected for the elevation response of the antenna , yielding a source flux density measurement .",
    "the calibration is rather coarse . in practice",
    "we find that the flux densities of solar radio bursts measured by the stare systems generally agree from site to site only within a factor of 2 or so .",
    "comparing measurements between sites , we find that the green  bank instrument systematically reports flux densities approximately a factor of 2 larger than those reported by hancock , which in turn are approximately a factor of 2 larger than those reported by north  liberty .",
    "in addition , there is significant variation of these ratios from event to event .",
    "we believe this is due primarily to uncertainties in two parts of the receiving systems .",
    "first , the beam patterns of the antennas were determined on a @xmath51 scale model , and may not transfer very well to the actual feeds .",
    "this would cause elevation dependent variations in the calibration and could account for the scatter in the systematic differences between sites .",
    "second , the excess noise temperatures of the noise sources used for gain calibration were measured when the systems were constructed , and may have changed over the several years of aging they have experienced .",
    "this could be the cause of the overall systematic differences between sites .",
    "clearly the calibration accuracy could be improved by measuring or computing numerically the antenna beam patterns , and by measuring the present noise source characteristics .",
    "but for our purpose here , we consider the calibration accuracy of a factor of a few to be adequate and defer the improvements to later work .",
    "the first stare site was set up at the vlba station in hancock , nh .",
    "a subsequent period of site evaluation and debugging led to the final configuration with sites at hancock , new hampshire ; north liberty , iowa ; and green bank , west virginia .",
    "the system operated in this state for approximately 18 months .",
    "we describe here the results obtained from the data collected from 1998  may  27 through 1999  november  19 .      in 18  months of operation , stare detected hundreds of thousands of events at green  bank and north  liberty , and millions at hancock with its weaker triggering threshold .",
    "the exact numbers are given in table  [ table : singlesiteresults ] .",
    ".[table : singlesiteresults]single - site event detection results , 1998 may 27 to 1999 november 19 [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     using the mean single - point event rates computed from the single - site event detection results , we can estimate the rate of accidental single - point coincidences among the sites . for a mean event rate @xmath52 , the probability that a time interval @xmath53 contains",
    "an event is @xmath54 ( assuming @xmath55 , which is true for stare since @xmath56 ) . thus for three sites with mean event rates @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , the probability that a time interval @xmath53 contains an event at all three sites is @xmath60 .",
    "the mean time @xmath61 between accidental three - site coincidences is then @xmath62 . using the rates given in table  [ table : singlesiteresults ]",
    ", we find @xmath63 . with only two sites ( even those with the lowest event rates : green  bank and north  liberty ) , this time is @xmath64 .",
    "this illustrates the power of the coincidence requirement in filtering out local radio frequency interference .",
    "it also makes clear that the third site is required to reduce the accidental coincidence rate to a manageable level .",
    "a similar examination of accidental coincidence rates for multi - point events is not necessary , since their temporal structure provides much more information than is available with single - point coincidences .",
    "accidental coincidences may be ruled out simply by direct comparison of the time - series data from each of the sites .",
    "unless the events have the same shape , they can be rejected as events of interest .      in approximately 18 months of data collection , the three stare sites recorded well over 4  million radio bursts . of these",
    ", 3898 were identified to be in temporal coincidence among all three sites : 1859 at hancock , 1069 at green bank , and 970 at north liberty .",
    "the numbers are unequal because of the spiky temporal nature of many of the events . despite the use of the adaptive threshold algorithm described in ",
    "[ subsection : coincidencedetection ] , the event detection algorithm tended to break up long events into multiple events , depending on exactly how the measured power varied around the detection thresholds . in many instances , a single long event observed at one site",
    "was broken up into multiple events at the others , due to sensitivity differences between sites . in this case , stare reported multiple coincidences despite one site reporting only a single event . to account for this effect",
    ", the data for each reported coincidence were examined visually to determine which of these multiple events were really just parts of the same overall event .",
    "after this reduction step , we found that the reported coincidences collapsed into 126 distinct events . examining each of these more carefully",
    ", we found that 27 were accidental .",
    "accidental events were identified using two criteria : the time dependence of the events differed obviously among the sites , and/or one or more of the sites showed a temporarily very high event rate , due to some local rf emitting phenomenon . ignoring the accidental events , we find that stare detected 99 events which appear to be of astronomical origin .    since we expect that the sun is the most intense source of transient radio emission in the sky , we compared the stare events with those detected independently by a solar monitoring station .",
    "the united states air force operates a worldwide `` radio solar telescope network '' ( rstn ) for the purpose of producing warnings about solar weather events which could disrupt terrestrial systems . conveniently for us ,",
    "one of the stations of the rstn is sagamore hill solar radio observatory in hamilton , massachusetts , approximately 80km@xmath9 distant from our stare instrument in hancock , new hampshire .",
    "the rstn monitors the sun for transient activity at eight fixed frequencies , one of which is 610mhz@xmath0 , the same as the stare observing frequency .",
    "thus the record from the sagamore hill rstn station is useful to us for comparison and verification purposes .",
    "the rstn 610mhz@xmath0 system operates on an 8.5m@xmath65 dish , using a dipole feed to measure a single linear polarization , recording the solar flux density once per second @xcite .    during the 18  months of",
    "stare three - site data collection , the rstn sagamore hill station reported 146 solar radio bursts at 610mhz@xmath0 . after combining these events with the 99 detected by stare during this time , we divided the ensemble of events into three groups : those detected by stare only ( 58 events ) , those detected by rstn only ( 105 events ) , and those detected by both stare and rstn ( 41 events ) .",
    "of course the first group is potentially the most interesting as it may include transient astronomical radio emission from non - solar sources .",
    "the other groups are useful in understanding the behavior of the stare system .",
    "to illustrate a typical event , we show in figure  [ figure : eventdetail ] the event detected by stare and rstn on 1999  may  23 at 17:30  utc .",
    "we first compared the peak flux densities of the events measured by stare and rstn , and we found that the hancock site produces flux density estimates which are on average closest to those of the rstn .",
    "the green  bank site produces higher values , and the north  liberty site produces lower values , more or less consistent with the systematic flux density scale differences described in ",
    "[ subsection : calibration ] , although with a large scatter around these averages .",
    "note however that we do not expect particularly good agreement between stare and rstn flux density measurements since stare measures the total flux density in both polarizations , while rstn measures a single linear polarization .",
    "the exact ratios of the measurements depend on the polarization of the received radiation .",
    "we used the full ensemble of 204 events to help characterize the triggering criteria of stare and rstn .",
    "figure  [ figure : durvsflux ] shows plots of event flux density against event duration for both rstn - measured values and stare - measured values ( from hancock , since it is in closest agreement with rstn ) .",
    "we can draw several conclusions from these plots .",
    "from the left plot , we see that stare is more sensitive to short duration events .",
    "this is to be expected , since stare takes eight samples per second , while the rstn takes one . from the right plot",
    ", we see that the rstn has better sensitivity .",
    "this is also to be expected , since rstn uses a parabolic dish which tracks the sun . to properly interpret the right plot in figure  [ figure : durvsflux ] , note that rstn reports only the start and end times for events , with one - minute accuracy , accounting for the distinct columns of points in the plot . for this plot",
    ", we arbitrarily assigned a duration of 1s@xmath1 to events listed as starting and ending in the same minute .",
    "we then examined the 105 events detected by rstn only , and found three reasons that they were not detected by stare .",
    "74 of the events were simply too faint for detection by stare .",
    "for another 25 of the events , manual examination of the stare data showed that the events were indeed recorded , but that they did not exceed the trigger threshold at all three sites , so they were not identified as 3-way coincidences .",
    "for the remaining 6 events , there were no data recorded by one or more stare sites at the time of the rstn event , due to the systems being off the air for maintenance or other purposes .",
    "from these results we gain confidence that during the 18  months of three - site data collection , stare detected the events we expected it to detect .",
    "finally , we examined the final group of 58 events : those detected by stare but not by the rstn . from the left plot in figure  [ figure : durvsflux ]",
    ", we see that many of these events are of short duration , suggesting that they might have been of solar origin but were too short to trigger a radio burst alert from rstn .",
    "in addition , all of the events occurred during daytime hours .",
    "to determine unequivocally whether these events were from the sun , we obtained the rstn 1-second data stream and compared it directly with the stare records . for 51 of the events ,",
    "the signal was easily discernible in the sagamore  hill rstn record , matching the stare event well in time and shape . a somewhat deeper investigation into why these events were not reported by rstn determined that when events are detected by rstn , a human examines the data to decide whether burst alerts should be issued @xcite , so we should not count on the burst alerts as a complete record .",
    "the other 7 events were not found in the sagamore  hill rstn record because of gaps in the data , due to equipment outages or calibration .",
    "for these , we obtained and examined the data from two other rstn sites : san  vito , italy , and palehua , hawaii .",
    "five of the remaining events were unambiguously identified in these records .",
    "the two remaining events occurred at times when no rstn data were available ; at san  vito , the sun had already set , and at palehua , the events occurred during gaps in the data .",
    "however , we suspect that these two are due to solar radio bursts as well . for one event ,",
    "the sagamore  hill data resume several seconds after the stare event time , and show the final moments of an event in progress . for the other , a large solar radio burst ( detected by both stare and rstn ) occurs less than 30  minutes after the event . in both the rstn and stare records we see that events tend to be clustered in time , so it would not be unusual if this event were related to the following large burst . in addition , both of the unidentified stare events are very short ( @xmath66 ) , and so are unlikely to have been detected by rstn , as discussed above in reference to figure  [ figure : durvsflux ] .",
    "although we can not definitively associate these two events with solar radio bursts , we believe that the indirect evidence indicates that such an association is warranted . from these results",
    "we deduce that all of the astronomical signals detected by stare were due to solar radio bursts .",
    "we have presented evidence that all of the astronomical events detected by stare are of solar origin . with this result",
    "we can speculate about astrophysical scenarios that could result in stare detections . to do this",
    "we establish a fiducial flux density detection threshold for the system . from the results in  [ subsection : coincidencedetection ] , we begin with @xmath67 , the observed median stare zenith coincidence detection sensitivity .",
    "then , since most events would happen away from zenith , we multiply by 3 , the approximate factor by which the antenna response is reduced at @xmath68 elevation .",
    "this yields approximately @xmath69 , which we adopt for this section as the typical stare coincidence detection sensitivity .    to interpret this limit in an astrophysical context , it is useful to recast it in terms of brightness temperature @xmath70 . for a source with a uniform spatial brightness distribution ,",
    "the flux density is @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the specific intensity of the source , and @xmath73 is its solid angle .",
    "then in the rayleigh - jeans limit ( @xmath74 ) , the source has brightness temperature @xmath75 using our detection limit fixes @xmath76 .",
    "an object of linear size @xmath77 at distance @xmath78 occupies a solid angle @xmath79 , yielding @xmath80 figure  [ figure : brightnesstemp ] shows this relation plotted for several choices of @xmath77 . for a source of linear size @xmath77 at a distance @xmath78",
    ", this plot indicates the brightness temperature required to produce a flux density which would trigger a detection by stare .",
    "it is immediately obvious that at this sensitivity stare has no hope of detecting distant objects .",
    "for nearby objects , say within a few kpc , the required brightness temperatures are high but not unprecedented .",
    "for example , we have shown the unequivocal detection of solar radio bursts .",
    "typical flux densities of these events are @xmath81 , corresponding to a brightness temperature of @xmath82 many of the observed solar radio bursts display intensity variations at the stare time resolution of 0.125s@xmath1 , which with a light travel - time argument yields an upper limit on the size of the emission region of @xmath83 . using these values",
    ", we find a brightness temperature limit of @xmath84 .",
    "this combination of duration and brightness suggests that the detected events are type  i or type  iii solar bursts , both of which arise from coherent plasma radiation @xcite .",
    "although it is unlikely that any members of known classes of non - solar sources would be near enough for detection by stare , it is illustrative to consider what conditions would be required of them for detectability .",
    "one example of a class of source known to produce very high brightness temperatures is that of the radio pulsars . as mentioned in  [ subsection : sources ] , the crab pulsar has been observed to produce individual giant pulses with flux densities exceeding 2000jy@xmath19 . with observing frequency @xmath85 @xcite , distance @xmath86 to the pulsar , and choosing @xmath87 for the size of the emission region , the brightness temperature is @xmath88 the steep spectrum of pulsar emission would make this even brighter at 611mhz@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this is close to the detection threshold for stare , but since the pulses are significantly shorter than the stare averaging time , the signal would be too diluted to detect",
    ". however , this suggests that another closer pulsar which produced such bright giant pulses might be detectable .",
    "we can consider more generally the radio emission due to a particular emission mechanism .",
    "for example , many sources produce radio emission at 611mhz@xmath0 by the synchrotron mechanism , in which high - energy electrons are accelerated through a spiral path by a magnetic field .",
    "it is well known that in general a source emitting incoherent synchrotron radiation can not shine with brightness temperature greater than @xmath89 , since inverse compton scattering becomes the dominant energy sink ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from figure  [ figure",
    ": brightnesstemp ] we see that a synchrotron source with @xmath90 would only be detectable by stare if it were improbably large and close . for example , a source of size 1a.u.@xmath91 would have to be within a few tens of parsecs to produce a flux density above the stare detection threshold .",
    "however , it is possible for such sources to exceed the @xmath92 limit temporarily during a phenomenon which causes an impulsive injection of energy and a corresponding flare @xcite .",
    "one class of source which is known to radiate via the synchrotron mechanism and produce rapid variability is that of the galactic `` microquasars '' @xcite .",
    "@xcite monitored the microquasar grs  1915 + 105 for several months , observing large outbursts , reaching a maximum of 1.5jy@xmath19 at 1.4ghz@xmath10 .",
    "using this flux density and the observed spectral power - law index of -0.87 , we obtain the expected flux density at 611mhz@xmath0 ; with the source distance of 12.5kpc@xmath93 and assuming a source size of 1a.u.@xmath91 , we can calculate a brightness temperature of @xmath94 for this outburst .",
    "figure  [ figure : brightnesstemp ] shows that with these physical parameters , such an outburst might be detectable by stare if it were closer than a kiloparsec or so .    to view the radio sky somewhat differently ,",
    "stare could operate with a shorter boxcar averaging period than the 0.125s@xmath1 ( 6250 samples of 20s@xmath95 each ) used for the data presented here , yielding better time resolution ( at the expense of sensitivity , of course ) .",
    "if the averaging length were shortened to less than the light travel time from one stare station to another , the localization of sources in the sky would be possible in principle by comparing arrival times of signals at the stare stations .",
    "in addition to source positions , this method would provide another filter for rejecting terrestrial interference . at the highest data acquisition rate ( 50khz@xmath36 )",
    ", the three stare stations could theoretically produce localizations of transient astronomical radio sources to better than @xmath96 over much of the sky @xcite . in practice ,",
    "operating stare in such a mode would require further technical development to handle the high data rate described .",
    "with the dizzying pace of computer technology advancement , however , the required technical improvements are much more tractable at this writing than they were just a few years ago when stare was constructed .",
    "a burst localization mode like that described here will likely be an important feature of future work .    stare has assembled in digital form a large record of the temporal behavior of the radio sky at 611mhz@xmath0 , presenting wide opportunity for further analysis .",
    "one possibility is to take advantage of the multiple sampling of the same region of sky every 24  hours by averaging and performing a frequency domain analysis to search for periodic signals .",
    "this would be very much in the same vein as the work of @xcite and @xcite , who analyzed the archived batse 1.024s@xmath1 data stream to find previously unknown x - ray pulsars . while the sensitivity of the batse large - area detectors is well below its optimum at the typical peak energies of x - ray pulsars , the large volume of data collected by batse allowed excellent sensitivity by averaging .",
    "the situation is much the same with stare . by averaging many months worth of data ,",
    "good sensitivity can in principle be achieved for periods greater than 0.25s@xmath1 .",
    "a significant number of radio pulsars have periods longer than this , with many exceeding 1s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "unknown radio pulsars with such long periods would be candidates for detection by stare through this technique .",
    "we have operated the survey for transient astronomical radio emission from 1998  may  27 to 1999  november  19 , monitoring the 611mhz@xmath0 radio sky to detect transient radio signals of astronomical origin with durations of a few minutes or less .",
    "stare observed the sky above the northeastern part of the united states using three geographically separated zenith - looking detectors which made 8 measurements per second , 24 hours per day . in 18  months of observing",
    "we detected a total of 4,318,486 radio bursts at the three stare stations .",
    "of these , 99.9% were determined to be due to local sources of radio noise .",
    "the remaining 3,898 were found to be associated with 99 solar radio bursts observed in coincidence at the three stations .",
    "these results demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of an rfi discriminator based on a coincidence technique using precision timing ( such as the gps ) at geographically separated sites .",
    "technological advances have allowed stare to update similar experiments performed in the 1970s . with the stare data stored digitally ,",
    "the potential for further analysis is much greater than for those experiments which recorded data on chart paper .",
    "the data could easily be reanalyzed to detect transients on longer time scales .",
    "in addition , the large temporal and solid angle coverage could make the data useful for a variety of other purposes , such as searches for periodic signals and studies of the radio frequency interference environment at the observatory sites .",
    "we can interpret the non - detection of extrasolar transient astronomical radio emission as indicative of the absence of bright bursting or flaring sources within 1kpc@xmath93 or so of the solar system , over the 18  months of our observations .",
    "this rules out the existence of any known classes of sources in the solar neighborhood .",
    "perhaps more importantly , it rules out the existence of nearby sources of previously unknown types which might produce short timescale transient radio emission .",
    "the absence of quiescent radio emission from such sources means that they would not have been detected by traditional pencil - beam surveys ; through their flaring activity they may have revealed their existence only to a program such as stare .",
    "the detection of transient astronomical electromagnetic radiation requires different observing techniques than those offered by the typical observatory with its scheduled blocks of time .",
    "since signals may appear unexpectedly in time and space , their detection requires a different class of temporal and spatial coverage than that provided by traditional telescopes . in a simple system like stare , spatial coverage",
    "is achieved at the expense of reduced brightness sensitivity , while temporal coverage is achieved by the use of dedicated automated unattended instruments which can monitor continuously .",
    "stare has been a useful exercise for exploring the techniques required to detect unexpected signals from astronomical sources .",
    "we consider this to be preliminary work in this area , which we expect will progress to development of more sophisticated techniques and instruments providing better coverage with higher sensitivity .",
    "indeed , we observe in the planning for new radio telescopes such as the square kilometer array and the low - frequency array for radioastronomy renewed interest in the transient radio sky , with discussions of sources such as neutron star magnetospheres , gamma - ray burst sources , planetary magnetospheres and atmospheres , accretion disk transients , and even extraterrestrial intelligence , to name a few .",
    "and of course the most exciting prospect for such work is the detection of entirely new types of sources .",
    "it appears that the detection of transient astronomical radio emission will be a topic of great interest for many years to come .",
    "we thank the many people who have made stare possible . at the national radio astronomy observatory ,",
    "m.  goss offered the use of vlba stations for stare receivers , while f.j .",
    "lockman offered the use of space at green  bank .",
