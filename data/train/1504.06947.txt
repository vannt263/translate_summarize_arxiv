    "if we remove small bodies from @xmath4 with appropriate @xmath158 and/ or capacitance @xmath159 so that @xmath166 , then the new elastic material will behave every where in @xmath5 as the background medium . hence the new material will not scatter the sent incident waves , i.e. the region @xmath4 modeled by @xmath10 will be cloaked .",
    "the equivalent behavior between a collection of , appropriately dense , small holes and an extended penetrable obstacle modeled by an additive potential was already observed by cioranescu and murat @xcite and also the references therein , where the coefficient @xmath158 is reduced to zero since locally they have only one hole .",

    ", we do not need such periodicity and no homogenization is used . instead",

    "this analysis was already tested for the acoustic model in @xcite .",
    "compared to @xcite , here , in addition to the difficulties coming from the vector character of the lam system , we improved the order of the error estimate , i.e. @xmath167 instead of @xmath168 which , for @xmath169 for instance , reduce to @xmath170 and @xmath171 respectively .",
    "let us finally mention that a result similar to ( [ b - rho ] ) , for the acoustic model , is also derived by ramm in several of his papers , see for instance @xcite , but without error estimates .",
    "compared to his results , and as we said earlier in addition to the vector character of lame model , we provide the approximation by improved explicit error estimates without any other assumptions while , as shown in @xcite for instance , in addition to some formal arguments , he needs extra assumptions on the distribution of the obstacles .",
