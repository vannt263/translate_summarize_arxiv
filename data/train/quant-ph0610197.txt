    "<S> quantum correlations between bright pump , signal , and idler beams produced by an optical parametric oscillator , all with different frequencies , are experimentally demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the degree of entanglement between signal and idler fields is improved by using information of pump fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first observation of three - color optical quantum correlations .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum correlations are a signature of nonclassical light generation . </S>",
    "<S> the optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) is the best - known and most widely used source of such correlations . </S>",
    "<S> squeezing in the intensity difference of the twin beams it produces above - threshold ( signal and idler )  @xcite reached the record value of @xmath0  db  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> bipartite continuous variable ( cv ) entanglement in this system , which requires the observation of phase anticorrelations as well , was only demonstrated very recently  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the parametric process involves three fields , yet the pump field is typically treated as a classical quantity . as an exception , quantum properties of the pump were first measured by kasai _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this arises a natural question : are there quantum correlations between all three fields ? </S>",
    "<S> an affirmative answer has been recently given by villar _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , who investigated the problem theoretically . here </S>",
    "<S> , we provide the first experimental affirmative answer by observing triple correlations between quadratures of pump , signal , and idler fields .    beyond the demonstration of nonclassical light features </S>",
    "<S> , one should notice that all three fields have different frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the interest of quantum frequency conversion was noticed in the early 1990s  @xcite and opens perspectives for the interaction of light with physical systems having different resonance frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the above - threshold opo produces , in general , nondegenerate twin beams and the pump beam has approximately twice their frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> three - color quantum correlations increase the number of physical systems that can be simultaneously investigated . </S>",
    "<S> correlations with the pump can also be used to enhance the bipartite entanglement between the twin beams , as we show below .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum correlations should exist between the phase quadrature of the pump field and the sum of phase quadratures of signal and idler fields as a direct consequence of energy conservation @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , by relating frequency fluctuations to phase fluctuations , we obtain @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> indices @xmath3 refer to pump , signal and idler fields , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the quadratures are defined through the field annihilation operators @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is chosen so that @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> when the opo is detuned from exact triple resonance , this phase - phase correlation , @xmath7 , is partially transferred to an amplitude - phase correlation , @xmath8 , owing to phase noise to amplitude noise conversion  @xcite inside the opo cavity @xmath9 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> our experiment is designed to measure joint fluctuations of a combination of @xmath10 and @xmath11 and compare them to the shot noise level , which defines the standard quantum limit ( sql ) . </S>",
    "<S> this will enable us to improve the bipartite entanglement of the twin beams .    </S>",
    "<S> twin beam entanglement is proven by violation of an inequality derived by duan _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and simon  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> van loock and furusawa  @xcite generalized it to include a third field : @xmath12 here @xmath13 is a parameter chosen to minimize the left - hand side of the expression above and @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> each term @xmath15 and @xmath16 is normalized to the sql . our attention will be focused on the corrected phase sum noise ( second term above ) , which can be rewritten as @xmath17 if @xmath18 and @xmath19 , there is a quantum correlation between @xmath11 and @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental setup is sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the triply resonant type - ii opo is pumped by a frequency doubled diode - pumped nd : yag laser ( innolight diabolo ) at 532 nm . </S>",
    "<S> this laser is first transmitted through a filter cavity ( bandwidth of 2.4  mhz ) prior to injection in the opo , which removes all classical noise for analysis frequencies above 15  mhz . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to have a shot noise - limited pump , since excess pump phase noise is converted to excess noise in @xmath10 , thus hindering twin beam entanglement  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear crystal is a 10  mm long potassium titanyl phosphate ( ktp ) from litton . </S>",
    "<S> the opo cavity input mirror is flat , directly coated on one crystal surface , with 97% reflection at 532  nm and high reflectivity ( r@xmath2099.8% ) at 1064  nm . </S>",
    "<S> the other crystal surface is anti - reflection coated for both wavelengths ( r@xmath213% at 532  nm and r@xmath210.25% at 1064  nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spherical output mirror is a high reflector for 532  nm ( r@xmath2099.8% ) and partial reflector for 1064  nm , r=96% , with a curvature radius of 25  mm . </S>",
    "<S> the opo cavity bandwidth for 1064  nm is 50  mhz and the threshold power is 12  mw . </S>",
    "<S> orthogonally polarized signal and idler beams are separated by a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) . in order to measure their quadrature noise , each beam </S>",
    "<S> is reflected off an analysis optical cavity , which converts phase noise to amplitude noise as a function of its detuning  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the twin beams are finally detected on high quantum efficiency ( @xmath22 ) photodiodes ( epitaxx etx300 ) . </S>",
    "<S> both analysis cavities have bandwidths of 14(1 ) mhz . </S>",
    "<S> overall detection efficiency is @xmath23% . </S>",
    "<S> signal and idler optical frequencies differ by approximately 0.35 thz , corresponding to @xmath24  nm in wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> photocurrents are recorded as a function of time as both cavities are synchronously scanned . at the same time , </S>",
    "<S> amplitude fluctuations of the reflected pump beam ( extracted by means of a pbs and a faraday rotator ) are recorded by another photodetector ( eg&g fnd100 , quantum efficiency 60% ) , with an overall detection efficiency of @xmath25% ( we are currently working to improve this value by using higher quantum efficiency photodiodes ) . </S>",
    "<S> noise power spectra are obtained by direct demodulation of the photocurrents . </S>",
    "<S> each photocurrent is electronically mixed with the same sinusoidal reference at the analysis frequency @xmath26  mhz and the low frequency beat signal is sampled at a 600  khz repetition rate by an analog - to - digital ( a / d ) card connected to a computer . </S>",
    "<S> variances of these fluctuations are then calculated by taking groups of 1000 points , and finally normalized to the sql .    </S>",
    "<S> typical noise spectra of sum and difference of twin beam quadratures are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , as functions of analysis cavities detuning relative to their bandwidth , @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> phase noise @xmath28 is measured for @xmath29 and also ( partially ) for @xmath30 . far off ( @xmath31 ) and on exact resonance ( @xmath32 ) </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude noise @xmath33 is measured . </S>",
    "<S> the squeezed difference of amplitude quadratures @xmath34 and the shot noise limited sum of phase quadratures @xmath35 suffice to demonstrate bipartite entanglement , since @xmath36 .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum correlations between pump and downconverted fields are demonstrated in the full line curve . </S>",
    "<S> it shows that @xmath37 can be reduced by using information from the pump beam amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> when corrected by @xmath38 , the _ shot noise limited _ sum of phases @xmath37 becomes _ squeezed _ : @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the generalized criterion of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ineqtriple ] ) assumes the improved value @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> the behaviors of @xmath41 , @xmath37 , and @xmath42 are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , as functions of pump power relative to threshold , @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> each experimental point was taken from curves similar to those of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the solid lines were calculated from the standard linearized opo theory  @xcite . as described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , the theory has to be corrected to include extra noise acquired by the intracavity pump field and which is not related to the parametric process . </S>",
    "<S> we model this by simply adding noise to the input pump field . </S>",
    "<S> this noise depends on the opo cavity detuning for the pump field  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since in our present experiment we do not have precise control or knowledge of opo cavity detunings for pump , @xmath44 , and downconverted fields , @xmath45 ( all normalized to the opo cavity bandwidth for the twin beams ) , these are used as free parameters to fit the data of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the excess phase noise added to the input pump , @xmath46 , which is deduced from independent measurements of the reflected pump beam for @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) , also has to be adjusted for the nonzero detunings .    </S>",
    "<S> we verify that @xmath37 is squeezed close to threshold and its noise increases as the pump power is increased , crossing the shot noise value at @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> its behavior was studied in detail in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> the correction term @xmath41 is always nonzero , varying from @xmath51 to @xmath52 for increasing @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with the theoretical prediction of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , since the degree of triple correlations should be maximum close to @xmath53 , where all fields have approximately the same intensity . in particular , for @xmath54 , the correlation between @xmath11 and @xmath10 reveals or increases the squeezing value in @xmath42 , attesting its quantum nature . </S>",
    "<S> better control of the detunings  @xcite would probably decrease the scattering of the data points . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical model is in good agreement with the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters that best fit the data are @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 . from these results </S>",
    "<S> , we can surmise that , for @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath10 should be strongly correlated .    in summary , twin beam entanglement produced by an above - threshold opo </S>",
    "<S> can be improved by using the quantum correlations with the pump beam demonstrated here . to our knowledge , this is the first experimental demonstration of three - color quantum correlations . they can be used , for instance , to increase the fidelity of quantum information distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement of triple optical quantum correlations is a necessary first step en route to the observation of three - color entanglement in the above - threshold opo . </S>"
