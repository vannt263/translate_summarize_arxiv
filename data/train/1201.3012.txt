    "micromegas ( for micro mesh gaseous structure ) is a parallel - plate detector invented by i. giomataris in 1995 @xcite .",
    "it consists of a thin metallic grid ( commonly called mesh ) and an anode plane , separated by insullated pillars .",
    "both structures define a small gap ( between 20 and 300  @xmath2 m ) , where primary electrons generated in the conversion volume are amplified , applying moderate voltages at the cathode and the mesh . this technology has proven to have many advantages like its high granularity , good energy and time resolution , easy construction , little mass and gain stability .",
    "the first detectors were built by screwing two different frames : the anode plane and the metallic grid , under which the insullated pillars were electroformed . by applying voltages to both structures ,",
    "the intense electric field pulled down the mesh and the flatness was thus defined by the height of the pillars , with an accuracy better than 10  @xmath2 m . the good flatness and parallelism between the anode and the mesh",
    "was obtained only if the delicate operation of screwing was successful . to avoid this operation , two different technologies ( called bulk @xcite and microbulk @xcite )",
    "have been developped so that the readout plane and the mesh formed a single integrated structure .    in the microbulk technology ,",
    "the raw material is a thin flexible polyimide foil with a thin copper layer on each side .",
    "the foil is glued on top of a rigid substrate that provides the support of the micro - structure and carries the anode strips or pixels . in the first step ,",
    "a thin photoresistive film is laminated on top of the kapton foil and is insolated by uv light to produce the required mask .",
    "the copper is then removed by a standard lithographic process , generating the pattern of a thin mesh .",
    "the polyimide between the mesh and the readout plane is then etched and removed under the mesh holes , but it remains almost intact elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the resulting detector has a more homogeneous amplification gap and a better mesh than the classical micromegas , reducing the avalanche fluctuations and improving the energy resolution .",
    "there is also a reduction of the border regions , eliminating dead zones and allowing its application in imaging with x - rays or neutrons .",
    "moreover , the detector is made of kapton and copper , two of the materials with the best levels of radiopurity .",
    "these materials define a level of contamination below pmts@xcite .",
    "the only possible drawbacks of this technique are its lack of robustness and the limited maximum size ( @xmath3 @xmath4 ) , due to the actual equipment .",
    "nevertheless , the improved detectors have been applied in several experiments like ntof @xcite , cast @xcite or next@xcite .",
    "the microbulk technology shows the best energy resolution of mpgd detectors , as good as 11%  fwhm at 5.9 kev in ar+5%ic@xmath0h@xmath1 , improving the values around 14%  fwhm reached by proportional counters two decades ago @xcite .",
    "the reference gas in tests was fixed by studies of that time , as a high gain and a good energy resolution was obtained . however , the improved performances of microbulk detectors give the oportunity to study in detail the influence of the gas mixture on these parameters and to verify the conclusions obtained with proportional counters . moreover ,",
    "if microbulk detectors could work at higher gains ( @xmath5 ) keeping a good energy resolution , this technology could be used in sub - kev applications , like in synchroton radiation and dark matter searches where the low energy threshold is crutial .    in this article , we present the performance of microbulk detectors in argon and neon - based mixtures .",
    "the detectors tested respectively have a gap size of 50 and 25 @xmath2 m .",
    "the first gap is the more common used in the new microbulk detectors and the second one is expected to show better performances at high pressure gases @xcite . in the second section , the setup and the procedure are described in detail .",
    "the features of microbulk detectors in argon- and neon - based mixtures with three different quenchers are described in sections three and four . finally , we present the rose - korff gain model for micromegas , the dependencies obtained for some gas parameters and we discuss the validity of this model and its possible relation with the energy resolution .",
    "we finish this report with some conclusions and an outlook of the actual developments .",
    "the vessel used in these tests ( figure [ fig : setup2 ] , left ) was specifically designed to characterize a maximum of three micromegas detectors ( not necessary microbulk ) in the same gas conditions , with a maximum surface of @xmath6 mm@xmath7 .",
    "it consists of an aluminium box , with an internal volume of @xmath8 mm@xmath9 and a wall thickness of 8 mm .",
    "the chamber is equipped with two gas entrances to circulate the desired gas .",
    "detectors are placed on a plastic support situated inside the vessel , which electrically isolates them from the inner walls . for each detector",
    ", there is a mesh frame screwed to the plastic plate , which is used as a drift cathode and defines a drift distance of 10  mm .",
    "the drift , mesh and anode voltages are respectively extracted by a high voltage ( shv ) and two signal ( bnc ) feed - throughs for each detector . on the top cap of the chamber , several holes allow the calibration by x - ray sources situated outside .",
    "these holes are covered by an aluminized mylar films , that are scotched to the inner wall of the cap with kapton and create the gas - tightness of the vessel .         during at least one hour , a flow of the desired mixture",
    "was circulated by the chamber . in the case of mixtures with cyclohexane",
    ", the base gas was forced to pass by a glass vessel , filled with this liquid quencher ( figure [ fig : setup2 ] , right ) .",
    "the gas concentration was defined by the liquid temperature , which was kept constant by a refrigerator in which the vessel was immersed .",
    "this temperature could not be higher than the ambient one to avoid possible quencher condensations inside the vessel .",
    "for a temperature of 25@xmath10c , this condition fixes a maximum concentration of 11% .",
    "the detectors were illuminated by an iron @xmath11fe source ( x - rays of 5.9 kev ) keeping the same gas flow .",
    "the mesh voltage was typically varied from 200 to 600  v and the drift one from 280 to 5000  v , depending on the type of gas .",
    "both voltages were powered independently by a caen n471a module .",
    "the avalanche induces a negative signal in the mesh , which is read out by an ortec 142c preamplifier .",
    "the preamplifier output was fed into an ortec 472a spectroscopy amplifier and subsequently into a multichannel analyzer amptek mca-8000a for spectra building . for reducing systematic errors",
    ", each spectrum has a minimum of @xmath12 points .",
    "two microbulk detectors respectively with a gap size of 25 and 50  @xmath2 m have been characterized .",
    "they have a circular shape ( 35 mm of diameter ) and a single non - segmented anode .",
    "their specific references are m50.70.35.04 and m25.50.25.09 , which respectively correspond to a pitch distance of 70 and 50  @xmath2 m and a hole diameter of 35 and 25  @xmath2 m .",
    "these particular detectors have showed an energy resolution of 11.7% and 11.8%  fwhm at 5.9 kev in ar  +  5%  ic@xmath0h@xmath1 , values which are close to the best value observed for microbulk detectors ( 11% fwhm ) .",
    "the drift voltage was firstly varied in our tests for a fixed mesh voltage to obtain the electron transmission curve , that shows the mesh transparency to primary ionization .",
    "these curves are shown for the argon - isobutane case and both detectors in figure [ fig : transariso ] .",
    "microbulk detectors show a plateau of maximum electron transmission for a wide range of ratios of drift - to - amplification fields . at higher drift fields ,",
    "the mesh stops being transparent for the primary electrons generated in the conversion volume and both the gain and the energy resolution degrade .",
    "the specific maximum value for the ratio depends on the diffusion coefficient , being wider the plateau for higher quantities of the quencher .",
    "this fact is in agreement with the shorter plateaus observed in pure gases @xcite and the wider plateaus measured in gases with low diffusion coefficients @xcite .",

    "the gain has been normalized to the maximum of each series .",

    "the gain has been normalized to the maximum of each series .",
    "the percentage of each series corresponds to the isobutane concentration.__,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]    however , the detector of 25  @xmath2m - thickness gap does not show the same behaviour , as shown in figure [ fig : transariso ] ( right ) . for low isobutane concentrations , there is a short plateau of maximum mesh transparency but it starts at relative high drift field . at high isobutane concentrations , this plateau disappears and there is a steady increase of the detector gain with the drift field . this effect has been verified by other microbulk of the same gap , a hole pitch between 50 and 100 @xmath2 m and a hole diameter between 20 and 30 @xmath2 m .",
    "a possible explanation is that the mesh may not be completely transparent for electrons for the pitch and hole diameter considered .",
    "indeed , the best values of the energy resolution are reached at low drift fields ( figure [ fig : eresdriftariso ] , right ) .",
    "the dependence of the energy resolution with the ratio of fields is shown in figure [ fig : eresdriftariso ] for argon - isobutane mixtures . for a gap size of 50  @xmath2 m",
    ", the energy resolution shows its best value for the same drift fields for which the electron transmission is the optimum .",
    "there is also a dependence on the isobutane concentration . for values below 5% ,",
    "the energy resolution is worse as not all the uv photons produced in the avalanche are absorbed @xcite . for values between 5 and 7%",
    ", the energy resolution reaches its optimum and then degrades at higher isobutane concentrations .",

    "this fact supports the hypothesis that the mesh is not totally transparent for electrons .",
    "there is also a dependence on the isobutane concentrations , but not so strong as for the former detector .",
    "the energy resolution degrades from 12% up to 14.5%  fwhm when the isobutane concentration passes from 7% to 30% , which is less than the 19% fwhm measured with the 50  @xmath2m - thickness - gap detector .",
    "the dependence of the peak position with the mesh voltage generates the gain curves , shown in figure [ fig : gainariso ] for argon - isobutane mixtures .",
    "the maximum gain before the spark limit is respectively @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the detectors with a gap size of 50 and 25@xmath15 m .",
    "this fact happens for all mixtures in the first case and only for isobutane concentrations over 10% for the second one .",
    "apart from that , the gain curves for low quantities of isobutane show a deviation from the rose and korff gain model @xcite at high amplification fields .",
    "this over - exponential behaviour is due to the low quencher concentrations , which can not avoid the production of secondary avalanches by the uv photons generated in the primary avalanche @xcite .",

    "the energy resolution degrades because the signal starts being comparable to the noise . at high gains , the resolution worsens due to the increase of the gain fluctuations .",

    "we will just focus on the main differences .",
    "the first particularity ( shown in figure [ fig : transm50argon ] ) is that the plateau of maximum electron transmission is wider for mixtures with cyclohexane and narrower for ethane , in comparison to isobutane .",
    "the argon - ethane result is consistent with its higher diffusion coefficient for the same percentage of quencher @xcite . in the case of cyclohexane , no data is available on its gas properties .",

    "we have also observed that the required voltage to reach the same gain is lower for cyclohexane , than for isobutane or ethane .",
    "for instance , an amplification field of 65  kv / cm must be applied to reach a gain of @xmath14 in ar+5%ic@xmath0h@xmath17 .",
    "this field is only 61  kv / cm in the case of cyclohexane and increases up to 72  kv / cm for ethane .",

    "we first note that the optimum performance of the 50  @xmath2m - thickness - gap microbulk is reached with quencher concentrations around 5% . for the gap of 25  @xmath2 m",
    ", this percentage rises up to 10% . nevertheless , the results are quite similar for all mixtures . from some measurements made with proportional counters in @xcite ,",
    "it was concluded that quenchers whose ionization threshold were similar to the first metastable level of argon ( 11.5 ev ) should show a higher gain and a better energy resolution .",
    "this improvement is related to a higher penning effect @xcite , i.e. , an energy transfer from the base gas atom to the quencher molecule , resulting in an increase of the avalanche ionization . however , this fact does not agree in the case of cyclohexane , as even if its ionization threshold ( 9.9 ev ) is a bit low , the gain is higher with no degradation on the energy resolution .",
    "recent studies @xcite support the main role of the non - metastable levels in penning effect .",
    "quenchers whose ionization threshold is lower than this level should show the same energy resolution .",
    "the higher gain observed in argon - cyclohexane mixtures could be related to a little contribution of argon excimers , created for energies between 8.9 and 10.3 ev .",
    "@xmath18    we finally present in figure [ fig : eresgainm50 ] the dependence of the energy resolution with the gain for the microbulk of 50  @xmath2m - thickness - gap in mixtures of argon with ethane and cyclohexane .",

    "other gas mixtures are being studied to increase micromegas sensitivity in the sub - kev region . for this purpose ,",
    "the signal to noise ratio must be increased and higher gains are needed , keeping a good energy resolution . a possible solution is the replacement of the base gas by neon , as the total charge per single avalanche is increased and approaches the rather limit ( @xmath19 electrons ) . however , the efficiency of the photon absorption is lower in this kind of mixtures , passing from 70% down to 10% at 6 kev , which limits the range of applications .",
    "we present the main features of the two detectors studied in neon mixtures with the same quenchers used before ( isobutane , cyclohexane and ethane ) .",

    "we will try to interpret this difference in terms of gas properties in the next section . a second fact observed",

    "this fact can not be explained by the fluctuations of the primary ionization but by the contribution of the detector avalanches . as described in @xcite ,",
    "the energy resolution of the detector can be expressed as @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the event energy , @xmath23 is the gas fano factor , @xmath24 is the mean energy necessary for creating an electron - ion pair in the gas and @xmath25 is the detector contribution . in neon - based mixtures , less",
    "primary electrons are generated due to its higher mean electron - ion pair energy ( respectively 36.4 and 26.3  ev for neon and argon @xcite ) , which should worsen the energy resolution as the fano factor is similar to both gases ( 0.17 @xcite ) .",
    "the detector contribution must be thus little for neon - based mixtures .",
    "in fact , as noted in @xcite , less avalanche fluctuations are presented in light gases like helium or neon due to their higher ionization yield .",

    "therefore , this simple model can give information on gas properties .",
    "this study was firstly made in @xcite .",
    "the gain curves generated in argon- and neon - based mixtures have been fitted to the equation [ eq : rose ] and the resulting dependencies of the electron mean free path and the threshold energy for ionization are respectively shown in figures [ fig : fitgainmfp ] and [ fig : fitgainie ] .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : fitgainmfp ] , the electron mean free path decreases as the quencher concentration is increased and , for the same base gas and detector , there is almost no difference for low quencher quantities . at high concentration ,",
    "mixtures with ethane show higher values than with isobutane . apart from that , neon - based mixtures show higher values than in argon - based ones . for instance , the electron mean free path is respectively 1.6 and 2.5  @xmath2 m in ar+5%ic@xmath0h@xmath1 and ne+5%ic@xmath0h@xmath1 for the 50  @xmath2m - thickness - gap detector .",
    "these three facts can be explained by theory @xcite , even if the exact values do not match .",

    "the electron mean free path ( figure [ fig : fitgainxenon ] , left ) is clearly lower than in other gases , as xenon is a heavier gas .",
    "small differences are due to higher systematic errors in the gain measurements .",

    "for the first type , this parameter increases with the quencher quantity and is independent of the gap size .",
    "for example , for a quencher percentage of 10% , the energy threshold is respectively 15.2 , 14.3 and 13.5 ev for ethane , isobutane and cyclohexane .",
    "in contrast , this parameter shows a minimum in neon - based mixtures , which depends on both the quencher and the detector .",
    "for all mixtures , values are higher for a gap size of 25  @xmath2 m .",
    "these differences can be explained by the penning effect .",
    "the transfer of energy from non - metastable levels of argon to the quencher molecule is complete for both detectors in argon - based mixtures and the energy threshold is only defined by the quencher . for neon , as the electron mean free path is longer , the transfer is limited by the gap size .",
    "this limitation disappears at high quencher quantities and the energy threshold for ionization increases with quencher concentration , as in argon - based mixtures .",
    "finally , the values obtained in neon are in general higher than in argon - based mixtures . for example",
    ", this parameter is respectively 15.6 and 14.8 ev in ne+5% ethane and ar+5% ethane for the 50  @xmath2m - thickness - gap detector .",
    "this fact is due to the higher values of this parameter for pure neon ( 21.6 ev ) than for pure argon ( 15.8 ev ) @xcite .",
    "note that the values given in literature for the base gases and for the quenchers ( 11.7 and 10.8 ev for ethane and isobutane ) do not match with the ones obtained . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "this fact can be explained by the penning effect @xcite , which is quite important in mixtures with big differences between the ionization threshold of the quencher and the excitation levels of the base gas .",
    "a good question is if the values obtained for the electron mean free path and the energy threshold for ionization could explain the energy resolution of a detector in a gas .",
    "we can start our discussion using @xcite , where it was concluded that the fluctuations due to defects of the mesh and the gap flatness could be compensated chosing the idoneous gap for each gas type .",
    "this optimum was obtained by differentiating the equation [ eq : rose ] , which results in @xmath34    we can interpret this minimum in terms of an optimum amplification field for a fixed gap .",
    "for each gas , this field should be as low as possible to fastly reach an optimum detector performance and to avoid the degradation of the energy resolution by other effects .",
    "therefore , the electron mean free path should be as high as possible and the values of the energy threshold for ionization should be little .    as shown in figures [ fig : fitgainmfp ] and [ fig : fitgainxenon ] ( right ) , the first parameter is mainly determined by the base gas , being higher for neon than for argon or xenon .",
    "the quencher concentration decreases its value , which in general degrades the energy resolution .",
    "there is also a dependence on the gap size , as lower values are obtained for a gap of 25  @xmath2 m .",
    "as we have shown , the gap size is only important in neon - based mixtures . in the case of the energy threshold for ionization ,",
    "we have observed lower values for cyclohexane than for isobutane and ethane but there is no clear improvement in the energy resolution .",
    "this variable could have thus little effect if the optimum amplification field is in the working range .",
    "microbulk is a micromegas technology that has been used in nuclear ( ntof ) and astroparticles experiments ( cast , next ) .",
    "it offers uniform and flexible structures with an excellent energy and time resolution , low background levels and low mass .",
    "two detectors , with a gap distance of respectively 50 and 25  @xmath2 m , have been characterized in argon - based mixtures with ethane , isobutane and cyclohexane , using a @xmath11fe source .",
    "the maximum gain before the spark limit is respectively @xmath13 and @xmath14 and the best energy resolutions obtained in argon - isobutane mixtures are 11.7% and 12.1%  fwhm at 5.9 kev .",
    "the plateau of maximum electron transmission depends on the quantity of quencher for the 50  @xmath2m - thick - gap detector and is almost inexistent for the gap of 25  @xmath2 m .",
    "the same conclusions have been obtained with the other quenchers but the gain is higher in argon - cyclohexane mixtures and lower with ethane .",
    "microbulk detectors have been also tested in neon - based mixtures with the same quenchers to reduce the energy threshold and to make micromegas sensitive to sub - kev energies .",
    "possible applications are synchroton radiation and dark matter searches .",
    "the maximum gain reached before the spark limit in argon - isobutane mixtures is respectively @xmath12 and @xmath27 for a gap size of 25 and 50  @xmath2 m and the best energy resolutions are 10.5% and 12.6%  fwhm at 5.9 kev .",
    "similar values for the energy resolution have been obtained with the other quenchers except for the detector of 25  @xmath2m - thickness gap and neon - based mixtures , whose values are worse .    the last developments of microbulk technology are focused in creating detectors with small gaps ( 12.5 and 25  @xmath2 m ) to be used with gases at high pressure .",
    "different hole pitchs and diameters are being studied .",
    "the use of other quenchers with even lower ionization threshold like cyclohexene are also planned , in order to confirm the divergences observed in argon - cyclohexane between micromegas detectors and proportional counters .",
    "we are thankfull to our colleagues of the university of zaragoza and irfu / cea - saclay , as well as to the rd51 collaboration for helpful discussions and encouragements .",
