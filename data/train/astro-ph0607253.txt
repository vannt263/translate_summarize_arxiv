    "the emission line region of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is complex and is usually divided to the narrow ( nlr ) and broad line region ( blr ) , where the physics of the nlr is better understood then that of the blr ( see e.g. sulentic et al .",
    "the most accepted scenario of the structure of agn is the one in which agn are powered by the accretion of matter from the host galaxy on to super - massive black hole .",
    "one of the way to study the inner emitting region of an agn , one that is closest to the black hole , is by analyzing its broad emission lines .",
    "so far , in a small fraction of agn double - peaked emission lines were detected ( around 5 % , see eracleous & halpern  2003 ) .",
    "modeling these lines gave proof to the presence of an accretion disc in the agn ( eracleous & halpern  1994 ,  2003 ) .",
    "beside the disc , emission lines also imply presence of more kinematically different emission regions that contribute to formation of lines : complex broad and narrow line regions ( popovi et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "even there are numerous papers devoted to the studies of the kinematical and physical properties of the nlr and blr ( krolik  1999 , kembhavi & narlikar  1999 , sulentic et al .",
    "2000 ) , it is not clear yet what is the connection between these two kinematically different regions .",
    "one of the method to study the connection is to map a whole emission region of an agn .",
    "for that one should have a high resolution spectra of the object that covers wide wavelength band .",
    "it is also needed that the agn emits both narrow and broad lines .",
    "accordingly , the spectroscopical investigations of seyfert 1 galaxies that have strong narrow lines ( as e.g. seyfert 1.5 ) are important . following these reasons , for our analysis we selected mrk 817 , that is a seyfert 1.5 galaxy , with the redshift of 0.03145 , * ( strauss & huchra  1988 ) determined from the emission lines * , and which both broad and narrow emission lines are complex ( popovi & mediavilla  1997 ; peterson et al .",
    "1998 ; popovi et al .",
    "also , for this galaxy the mass ( @xmath0 ) and the blr size ( @xmath1 light days , where @xmath2 is the gravitational radius for the black hole mass of @xmath3 ( g is the gravitational constant , m is the mass of the black hole and c is the speed of light ) . ] ) have been estimated by reverberation mapping studies ( peterson et al .",
    "1998 ,  2004 ; kaspi et al .",
    "we observed the galaxy several times collecting the high resolution spectra in the h@xmath4 and h@xmath5 wavelength band , as well as the low resolution spectra in the wide wavelength region .",
    "the aim of this work is to explore the properties of the whole emission region of the active galaxy mrk 817 . using the high - resolution spectra ( such as one obtained with the isaac newton telescope ) in analyzing the broad spectral line shapes and applying the two - component model of the blr proposed by popovi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we investigate the kinematical parameters of the blr in mrk 817 .",
    "first we will present the gaussian analysis of the h@xmath4 and h@xmath5 lines and after that we will apply the two - component model for fitting the broad emission lines .",
    "also , an estimate of the electron temperature in the blr will be given .",
    "finally we make a scheme of the emission line region of mrk 817 and discuss the complex structure of that region .",
    "in studying the blr of mrk 817 , three different sets of spectral observations were used :    \\i ) observations with the 2.5-m isaac newton telescope ( int ) at la palma island in spain .",
    "the observations were performed in the period 2125 of january 2002 .",
    "the intermediate dispersion spectrograph ( ids ) and the 235 camera in combination with the r1200y grating were used .",
    "two exposures of 550 and 500 s , included three h@xmath4 and three h@xmath5 spectrum .",
    "the seeing was @xmath6 and the slit width @xmath7 .",
    "the spectral resolution was around 1.0  .",
    "\\ii ) observations with the 4.2-m william herschel telescope ( wht ) , at la palma islands .",
    "the observations were performed on 12/13 march 2001 .",
    "the long - slit spectrograph ( isis ) was used , in combination with ccd cameras tek4 ( grating r158r ) .",
    "the h@xmath4 was observed with the exposure of 120 s. the slit width of the spectrograph was @xmath8 .",
    "the spectral resolution was about 2.9  .",
    "\\iii ) intermediate resolution optical spectroscopy was carried out with mexican 2.1-m telescope in observatorio astronomico nacional de san pedro martir ( oan spm ) .",
    "observation were carried out with the boller & chivens ( b&ch ) spectrograph , equipped with site 1k ccd .",
    "the width of a spectrograph slit was @xmath9 and grating was 600 lines / mm ( blue and red ) , providing a dispersion of 2  / pix and with the effective instrumental spectral resolution of about 4 (@xmath10pixels fwhm ) .",
    "observations were carried out during fotometric conditions 0607 of february 2005 , with the seeing of @xmath11 ( fwhm ) , when the spectral range covering the balmer lines was observed .",
    "exposure time for the blue part ( h@xmath5 region ) was 1800 s and for the red part ( h@xmath4 region ) was 3000 s.    standard reduction procedures , including bias and flat field corrections , wavelength calibration , spectral response , cosmic ray hits removal and sky subtraction were performed with the iraf software package .",
    "the software package dipso was used for reducing the level of the local continuum ( by using the dipso routine cdraw 1 ) fitted through the points taken to be on the local continuum ( full circles in figure  [ fig01 ] ) .",

    "the fitting procedure has been described several times ( popovi et al .  2002 ,  2003 ) . in the case of mrk 817",
    ", we have assumed that the narrow [ oiii ] @xmath124959 , 5007 emission lines can be composed by more than one gaussian component , as the blue - asymmetry is very obvious in their narrow lines ( popovi et al .",
    "2004 ) . in the fitting procedure , we look for the minimal number of gaussian components needed to fit the lines , taking into account the fixed intensity ratio of [ oiii ] @xmath12 4959 , 5007 lines ( the atomic value 1:3.03 ) and the fit of fe ii template for the h@xmath5 .",
    "we took the relative strengths of fe ii lines from korista ( 1992 ) and assumed that they all originate in the same region ( i.e. the lines have the same shift and @xmath15 ) .",
    "additionally , we assumed the core of the h@xmath5 line is originating in the same region as fe ii lines . in order to analyse the nlr kinematics , we fitted the [ oiii ] lines separately , after subtracting the continuum and the wings of the h@xmath5 line , keeping the ratio of both components constant ( @xmath16 , figure  [ fig03 ] ) . in the case of the h@xmath4 line , for the narrow [ nii ] @xmath12 6548 , 6583 lines we assumed",
    "their intensity ratio is 1:2.96 ( storey & zeippen  2000 ) .",
    "it was found that three broad gaussian and one narrow components could fit well the profiles of the h@xmath4 and h@xmath5 lines , where we can recognize clear evidence of substructure in these emission lines , not only in the broad component of the lines , but also in the narrow emission lines ( figure  [ fig02 ] ) .",

    "here we have used the strong hydrogen lines to discuss the physical properties of the mrk 817 blr . assuming that the blr is optically thin ( see corbin & boroson  1996 ) and h@xmath5 full width at zero intensity ( fwzi ) values additional evidence of an optically thin blr . ]",
    "we have applied the method ( so called boltzmann plot - bp ) proposed by popovi ( 2003 ) on the flux ratios of the hydrogen lines of the balmer series ( h@xmath4 , h@xmath5 , h@xmath18 , h@xmath19 , and h@xmath20 ) , obtained with the oan spm telescope . before measuring the emission line flux , it was necessary to clean the lines from its narrow component , as well as from the satellite lines ( especially in the case of the h@xmath4 and h@xmath5 ) . in the case of the h@xmath18",
    ", the fe ii contribution was subtracted using the fe ii template of vron - cetty et al .",
    ". the flux ratios of the balmer lines are given in the table  [ tab02 ] .",
    "the errors were estimated as cumulative errors of the continuum subtraction ( @xmath21 ) and the line flux measurement .",
    "the errors of the narrow and satellite lines subtraction are also present , but we estimated that errors of this procedure are within the frame of the above errors .    also , we took into account the reddening effects . in the case of mrk 817 ,",
    "the influence of the galactic reddening is insignificant , according to data in the nasa s extragalactic database ( ned ) , but the intrinsic reddening is higher , e(b - v)=0.22 ( cohen 1983 ) and should be taken into account .",
    "the values of the unreddened flux are also given in the table  [ tab02 ] ( as value ( b ) ) .",
    "this reddening coefficient has been determined for the nlr which implies that the reddening could be even higher in the blr , and consequently the obtained electron temperature may represent the lower limit .    also , it seems that the blr of mrk 817 is composed from two kinematically , and probably physically different regions ( see  3.3 ) , and the bp is applied on the summary emission of these two regions . in popovi",
    "et al . ( 2006 ) several combination were demonstrated , where the blr is composed of the one region in the partial local thermodynamical equilibrium ( plte ) and the other one in the non - plte conditions , and here we present one example . in this example",
    ", we assumed that in one region plte is present with @xmath22 k , and that other one , non - plte region , emits recombination balmer line spectrum ( `` case b '' ) with @xmath23 k , @xmath24 ( osterbrock 1989 , table 4.4 ) .",
    "we considered that the contribution of each region in the total emission flux ( @xmath25 ) can be different taking that @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the flux of the region in plte and non - plte , respectively .",
    "the coefficient @xmath29 is varied from 0.5 to 2 so different contributions of the non - plte emission in the total line flux were calculated ( the @xmath30 is taken to be 1 ) . in the figure  [ fig07 ] the bp is presented for the different values of the parameter @xmath29 , as well as for the cases when only plte or non - plte is present . as one can see from figure  [ fig07 ] , the determined temperature for a mixed blr ( one part in plte and one in the case b recombination ) are higher than they really are in the assumed different parts of the blr . as it was shown in popovi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , if the blr temperature obtained from bps are smaller than 20000 k , one may expect that plte exist at least in one part of the blr .",
    "k , open squares represent pure recombination ( @xmath31 k from the bp ) , full circles for @xmath32 ( @xmath33 k from the bp ) , open circles for @xmath34 ( @xmath35 k from the bp ) , full squares for @xmath36 ( @xmath37 k from the bp ) .,width=181 ]    for mrk 817 , in both cases , with or without reddening taken into account , the bp could be applied , meaning that the flux ratio of the balmer lines could be fitted with the straight line , but with different slopes . on the figure  [ fig08 ] , log(in ) vs. e(u ) , where @xmath38 is relative intensity of transition from upper to lower level ( @xmath39 ) , @xmath40 is the statistical wight of the upper level and @xmath41 is the transition probability .",
    "the e(u ) is the energy of the upper level of the line transition ( popovi  2003 ) . ]",
    "is presented for the case where correction for the intrinsic reddening was performed . according to calculated slopes",
    ", one may consider that plte exists at least in one part of the blr , and consequently give estimates of the electron temperature ( popovi  2003 ) .",
    "using the relationship given by popovi ( 2003 ) and a temperature parameter @xmath42 obtained from the slope ( see figure  [ fig06 ] ) we found that the electron temperature might be in an interval of @xmath43 k , depending on the reddening effect and the contribution of different regions to the total flux of broad balmer lines .    ,",
    "is given in the upper left corner of the plot.,width=173 ]",
    "@xmath44 is the outflow velocity and @xmath45 is the velocity dispersion obtained from the fwhm.,width=317 ]    > from the study of the narrow and broad emission lines we can make some conclusions on the emission line region structure of mrk 817",
    ". in general two main emission regions ( nlr and blr ) are present , but they seem to be complex as well . a scheme of the emission line region of mrk 817 is presented in figure  [ fig09 ] and it highly corresponds to the unified model scheme .    in the inner part of the emission region probably a relativistic disc or a disc - like region is present ( or vlbr see  3.3 ) .",
    "our analysis of the disc parameters shows that the minimal inner radius of the disc can not be smaller than 0.4 lt - days and that the disc should be smaller then 39 lt - days ( for a black hole mass of @xmath46 ) .",
    "these results are in the agreement with the results obtained by kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who estimated the dimensions of the blr to be @xmath47 lt - days . also , the inclination of the disc is small and in the range of @xmath48 .",
    "the other region seems to be spherical with isotropic velocity distribution .",
    "it is hard to estimate its dimensions , but one can conclude that it should not be significantly larger than the disc , since the velocity dispersion in this region ( @xmath49 ) is very similar to the velocity dispersion in the disc ( see table  [ tab01 ] ) . if we assume that the random velocities are decreasing from the center of an agn , one may conclude that these two regions are not too different in dimensions .",
    "it is therefore possible that this region is created by the disc wind ( murray & chiang  1997 ) .    in this complex blr , it is hard to determine the temperature ( see  5 ) , but from the bp one may have an impression that the temperature might be in an interval from 10000 k to 20000 k. as it was mentioned above , we could not use the bp method as an indicator of the physical parameters of the disc ( or vblr ) and the spherical region , since we did not have high resolution observation of the h@xmath18 , h@xmath19 and h@xmath20 lines , but the bp indicates that at least one of the two regions might be close to the plte ( see popovi et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the narrow line region is also complex and it consists of the nlr1 , with @xmath50 450 , and relative approaching velocity 400 with respect to the systemic redshift of the observed galaxy , and the nlr2 , with @xmath50 150 , and a redshift equal to the systemic one of the corresponding object . since the inclination angle of the disc is relatively small it is likely that we observe this agn along the approaching jet that emits only in the nlr1 .",
    "therefore , the outflow velocities should be higher for the factor of @xmath51 .",
    "there is no clear connection between the spherical region and nlr1 , but one can conclude that emission of the approaching jet in the optical spectral band is noticeable only far from the blr .",
    "it is , therefore , interesting that we can not register an outflow in the spherical part of the blr .",
    "it does not mean that we have no outflow in this region , but it might be that in this part the emission of the jet is in the radio spectral band .",
    "the high - resolution vla map of mrk 817 at 8.4 ghz ( kukula et al . 1995 ) shows a relatively symmetric shape of the radio emission , that may come from a line - of - sight orientated jet .",
    "in this contribution , we have reported the results of the emission line regions study of the seyfert 1.5 galaxy mrk 817 .",
    "the seyfert 1.5 galaxies are convenient for exploring the narrow and broad line emission regions since those galaxies have very strong both narrow and broad emission lines . in our work we have used several sets of different spectral observations with high spectral resolution .",
    "our main finding is that both nlr and blr are complex emission regions , where they are composed of at least two kinematically separated regions .",
    "we made a scheme of the emission line regions of mrk 817 ( figure  [ fig09 ] ) .",
    "we found that the blr of mrk 817 can be described with the two - component model , where the core of the line is coming from a spherical region with isotropic velocity distribution , and wings are probably affected by a low inclined accretion disc .",
    "* the ratio of the fluxes coming from the disc and from the spherical region did not depend on the parameters of the fit , it was almost the same in evert fit and equal to unity*. in the nlr , we found that an outflow is present . in principle",
    "we can conclude that emission line region of mrk 817 is complex , heaving at least four kinematically and physically different regions .",
