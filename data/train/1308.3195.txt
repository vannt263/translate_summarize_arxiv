    "the discovery that the celebrated bose hubbard model can be realized by cold - atom optical lattices @xcite , and its experimental confirmation @xcite , combined with great control capabilities in optical lattices , makes cold atoms an ideal setting for exploring properties of strongly correlated condensed matter systems @xcite , in particular at equilibrium due to remarkably good isolation from the environment .",
    "manipulation of the system , however , results in heating due to incoherent scattering of laser light @xcite , or particle loss due to interaction of atoms with the focussed electronic beam .",
    "the incurred particle loss can have interesting consequences and can in fact pronounce the correlations @xcite , generate entanglement @xcite , enhance the coherence of the system @xcite and result in nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "similarly to cold - atom optical lattices , the condensed matter systems can be realized also in exciton polariton gases @xcite and photon gases @xcite , implemented as arrays of nonlinear cavity resonators . unlike with cold - atoms , dissipation processes are unavoidable in photonic systems and photon loss must be compensated by pumping @xcite .",
    "photonic lattices are thus intrinsically nonequilibrium systems and offer a promising setting to explore _",
    "quantum many - body systems .",
    "the dynamics of coupled nonlinear cavities can be described by a dissipative bose hubbard - like model incorporating coherent pumping , known as _ driven - dissipative _ bose hubbard model @xcite where the dynamics is determined by the interplay of coherent laser pumping and dissipation and leads to various phases of the steady state @xcite .",
    "all these features of nonequilibrum steady states shift the role of dissipation from the unavoidable and undesired phenomenon where dissipation is overcome with help of decoherence - free subspaces @xcite , to a useful resource which can be exploited in universal quantum computation @xcite by controlling both dissipation and hamiltonian dynamics @xcite .",
    "coupling the system to the environment does not only result in particle losses , but also enables injection of particles , e.g. by incoherent pumping in optical lattices of photons @xcite .",
    "open one - dimensional systems where sites on either end are coupled to reservoirs have been subject of several studies , focusing in particular to transport properties .",
    "the dynamics in the markovian approximation for the reservoirs is given by the lindblad master equation which can be simulated numerically using the time dependent density matrix renormalization group algorithms ( t - dmrg ) @xcite in operator space @xcite .",
    "this matrix product state representation has been used to study transport properties of quantum chains @xcite , and also resulted in exact results in some cases , see e.g. refs . .",
    "furthermore , an explicit solution for liouville dynamics of quadratic quantum many - body systems with linear lindblad reservoirs was proposed @xcite ( so called `` third quantization '' ) and recently extended to bosonic systems @xcite .    in light of these results for nonequilibrium effective spin systems , we analyze the steady state of the bose hubbard model with lindblad reservoirs attached to either end of the system .",
    "unlike other approaches to nonequilibrium bose hubbard - like models , we consider both dissipation and pumping of particles , resulting in a nontrivial steady state . in the noninteracting limit and also in the setting with one or many symmetric reservoirs we provide analytic solutions to the particle density profile by means of the method of third quantization and operator space formalism , respectively , whereas the generic asymmetric case is simulated by means of the tdmrg algorithm .",
    "we also study the steady state of the driven - dissipative bose hubbard model and observe a subspace protected to coherent pumping in the noninteracting limit which gradually disappears with onset of interaction .",
    "the bose hubbard model on a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath0 sites is described by a hamiltonian operator @xmath1 where the tunneling term at rate @xmath2 corresponds to the kinetic energy and @xmath3 is the strength of the onsite repulsive interaction between particles .",
    "the annihilation and creation operators , denoted as @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , satisfy @xmath6 = \\delta_{jl}$ ] and @xmath7=0 $ ] whereas @xmath8 denotes the local particle number operator .",
    "the bose hubbard model can be realized in cold - atom optical lattices @xcite as well as in photon gases @xcite where both parameters can be precisely controlled .",
    "we shall also consider an additional hermitian term corresponding to coherent pumping in photon gases @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the coherent pumping amplitude .",
    "unlike the standard bose hubbard model  ( [ eq : h ] ) , the extended model  ( [ eq : homega ] ) does not preserve the number of particles in the system .",
    "let us now introduce dissipation by coupling the system to a reservoir .",
    "after tracing out the degrees of freedom in the environment and assuming markovian reservoirs , the effect of the coupling to the reservoirs is described by a master equation in the lindblad form @xmath11 +   \\sum_{\\mu } \\big ( 2 l_\\mu \\rho l_{\\mu}^\\dagger - \\ { l_{\\mu}^\\dagger l_{\\mu},\\rho \\ } \\big ) \\equiv \\mathcal{l}(\\rho ) \\label{eq : lrho}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 are lindblad operators .     and",
    "@xmath13 for left and right , respectively ) and incoherent pumping ( with rate @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) of particles , as well as coherent homogeneous pumping with an amplitude @xmath10 . ]",
    "we shall assume that the system can exchange particles with the environment in which case the lindblad operators are given as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is associated with emission of a particle at the @xmath18-th site in the system with rate @xmath19 whereas @xmath20 corresponds to absorption .",
    "the dynamics of a mixed state system  ( [ eq : lrho ] ) is thus described by the unitary ( dissipation free ) evolution @xmath21 $ ] and the non - unitary lindblad dissipative part .",
    "in the course of this work we shall assume that after a long time the system evolves towards a nonequilibrium steady state @xmath22 defined as a solution to @xmath23 or equivalently @xmath24 the existence of a steady state is not guaranteed in bosonic systems . in case where the emission rate is higher than the absorption rate , @xmath25 ,",
    "the system could accumulate more and more particles and no steady state would exist .",
    "we shall therefore restrict our study to the case @xmath26 .",
    "similarly , when the system is purely dissipative and the loss of particles is not compensated by pumping ( @xmath27 of incoherent and @xmath28 for coherent pumping ) , the steady state is trivial and is equal to the vacuum pure state , except in the case of decoherence - free subspaces .",
    "in general , the determination of the steady state  ( [ eq : steadystate ] ) is a quantum many - body problem where the computational complexity scales exponentially with the system size .",
    "nevertheless , the liouvillian operator @xmath29 defined in  ( [ eq : lrho ] ) is a linear operator and the question of the steady state can be reduced to an infinite dimensional linear algebra problem . in the noninteracting limit @xmath30 , the steady state",
    "can be constructed explicitly using the formalism of the `` third quantization '' @xcite and the expectation value of any local observable can be calculated exactly . in the generic interacting case , however , we must resort to numerical simulations . for these we shall assume a truncated @xmath31-dimensional bosonic space by allowing at most @xmath32 particles per site .",
    "we shall work in operator space such that the master equation with a liouville operator @xmath33 is expressed in a form resembling the schrdinger equation , @xmath34 this in turn allows us to simulate the steady state by the time evolution in operator space @xmath35 using the time - dependent dmrg algorithm @xcite .",
    "if the steady state , which is a right null vector of the liouvillian operator @xmath33 such that @xmath36 , is unique , any initial state @xmath37 will after a sufficiently long time relax to the steady state @xmath22 , as long as it has a nonzero overlap with the _ left _ null vector which is always equal to the identity operator , @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath39 .",
    "in particular , we start the simulation with the infinite - temperature equilibrium state @xmath40 and evolve it corresponding to  ( [ eq : rhot ] ) ad libitum .    the density matrices are represented as matrix product states in operator space @xmath41 \\alpha_j }   \\big ) { { \\vert   g^{\\alpha_1 } \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes g^{\\alpha_n }   ) } } \\label{eq : mps}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 are generalized @xmath43 gell - mann matrices and @xmath31 is the dimension of the local ( truncated ) bosonic space ( the dimension of operator space is @xmath44 ) . throughout the paper",

    ", we can choose @xmath46 \\alpha_j}$ ] in  ( [ eq : mps ] ) as real matrices which reduces the accessible operator space to hermitian ( but not neccessarily positive definite ) operators .",
    "practical implementations of the algorithm require a drastic truncation of the bosonic space .",
    "while the lowest nontrivial choice @xmath47 already provides a good qualitative picture , a faithful representation requires a slightly larger local bosonic space with @xmath48 .",
    "the complexity of numerical simulation is dominated by singular value decompositions of dense @xmath49 matrices where however only the leading @xmath50 singular vectors are retained .",
    "this stimulates the usage of iterative svd schemes , such as the _ randomized svd _ @xcite or the lanczos algorithm which both scale as @xmath51 as opposed to @xmath52 in the full ( e.g. qr - based ) svd implementation .",
    "we shall typically deal with low correlated states which are well described already by @xmath53 which allows us to work with @xmath54 .",
    "an accurate time evolution of the fully mixed density operator towards the steady state would in principle require larger bond dimensions in the transient regime .",
    "we are however only interested in the final steady state in which case working in a low correlated subspace of operator space yields the same results .",
    "our principal interest lies in the particle density profile @xmath55 of the steady state which ( in operator space framework ) is given as a scalar product with the density operator , @xmath56 other quantities can be calculated in a similar way , @xmath57 .",
    "another quantity of interest is the amount of correlations in the steady state which we will quantify through the operator space entanglement entropy ( osee ) @xcite , defined as an operator space analogue of the entanglement entropy for quantum states as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the `` reduced density operator '' in operator space , obtained by summing over the degrees of freedom in one part of the system , @xmath60    the osee is obtained from a mps description of the density operator in a straight forward way from schmidt coefficients @xmath61 in a bipartite splitting of the mps as @xmath62 , assuming @xmath63 .",
    "it was shown that the osee can be used as a signature of quantum critical behavior of the nonequilbrium steady state , being infinite in the thermodynamic limit in the case of steady states with long range correlations and finite otherwise @xcite .",
    "the liouvillian operator is a map over operator space which itself is infinitely dimensional also for a finite lattice size . in order to give a concise mathematical description",

    "the generic case where the number of sites is not divisible by four can also be obtained explicitly by mathematica @xcite ; the results however can not be represented in a compact form .",
    "the crucial difference to the previously studied case is that the protection from coherent pumping disappears , except in the case of equal reservoirs on both edges ( and an even number of sites ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : omega22 ] we show the particle density profile for @xmath216 sites and different reservoirs , @xmath123 and @xmath124 and @xmath98 where coherent pumping affects all sites ; the zig - zag pattern however persists .",
    "the interacting term in the liouvillian operator  ( [ eq : liouvillian ] ) is a quartic term in operators @xmath222 and the formalism of the third quantization no longer applies . in case of two or more equal reservoirs ,",
    "however , the nonequilibrium steady state can still be obtained exactly as a product density matrix operator which we shall use as an ansatz , @xmath223 where @xmath224 is a single - site density operator , @xmath225 such a gutzwiller ansatz has proven useful in determining the equilibrium properties of the bose hubbard model and considering the fact that we assume an equilibrium setting with equal reservoirs , this makes a valid physical assumption .",
    "the liouville operator consists of two parts : the unitary and the dissipative part .",
    "here we shall assume that @xmath226 vanishes for both parts separately .",
    "first we consider the unitary part and observe that the contribution of the quartic term in  ( [ eq : liouvillian ] ) involving an operator @xmath227 vanishes if @xmath228 and @xmath229 appear symmetrically in the steady state such that @xmath230 .",
    "the single site density operator @xmath224 thus reads @xmath231 where we have used an abbreviation @xmath232 next we consider the tunneling term in the liouvillian operator which maps a product operator for two neighboring @xmath18 and @xmath233 sites as @xmath234 a straight forward calculation reveals that the tunneling part vanishes if @xmath235 for all @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
    "this condition is easily satisfied by choosing @xmath238 for some positive real number @xmath239 . as mentioned earlier",
    ", the system amplifies indefinitely for @xmath240 whereas the steady state is trivial ( equal to the maximally mixed state ) for @xmath241 .",
    "finally , only the dissipative part of the liouvillian operator  ( [ eq : liouvillian ] ) remains and it vanishes if @xmath242 - 2 \\gamma_{j,2 } m r_{m-1 } = 0\\ ] ] for all sites @xmath18 that are coupled to reservoirs .",
    "it is easy to see that the recursive relation  ( [ eq : rk ] ) indeed solves the above recursion relation by setting @xmath243 this finally gives us the requirements that have to be met in order that the product operator  ( [ eq : gutzwiller ] ) is a solution for the steady state of the dissipative bose hubbard model .",
    "it is required that @xmath239 is site independent which is the case if ( i ) only one site is coupled to a reservoir , or ( ii ) the ratio @xmath244 is constant for all reservoirs .",
    "we can now immediately calculate the particle density in the steady state , given by @xmath245 $ ] as @xmath246 this result is valid for any set of parameters in the bose hubbard model ( including the disordered case with site - dependent tunneling rate and the interaction strength ) , if only the ratio between the emission rate and the absorption rate is constant for all existing reservoirs .",
    "hence , this solution always applies to the case with a single reservoir    the result obtained in this section is valid for the bose hubbard model with an infinitely dimensional bosonic space .",
    "it is however also possible to obtain an equivalent result in the case of a truncated bosonic space where at most @xmath32 bosons are allowed per site . in such a case the nonequilibrium steady state",
    "is again given as  ( [ eq : gutzwiller ] ) with @xmath247 where @xmath248 and the average number of particles obtains a correction , exponentially falling with @xmath31 , as @xmath249    this result offers a nice physical interpretation .",
    "first , two trivial limits , @xmath250 ( in case without particle injections ) and @xmath251 ( without particle losses ) correspond to a trivial vacuum state and the infinitely amplified state , respectively . in a nontrivial case",
    ", the reservoir imposes the desired particle density on the site it is coupled to whereas the hoppings make the system homogeneous .",
    "this phenomenon is surprising as it tells us that any initial state will eventually , albeit after a very long time if the tunneling rate is small , become completely uncorrelated , if the system is locally coupled to a reservoir and the steady state is unique .",
    "we note that the uniqueness is not guaranteed in general and there might exist other steady states in case of decoherence - free subspaces as shown in appendix  [ app : a ] ."
