    "we suggest a new mechanism that strongly increases the probability of low - energy nuclear reactions in condensed matter , in molecules , or in a plasma environment . although we do not aim to interpret a particular experiment , our interest in the subject was definitely inspired by a few publications , see @xcite and references therein , that claim a substantial increase of the dd fusion cross - section in solids . one obvious possibility for a boost of the fusion originates from the motion of the target deuterium caused by its vibrations in a condensed matter ( or other ) environment , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the vibration can be stimulated by the coulomb interaction of the projectile deuterium with the target one , giving an additional increase for the probability of the fusion , as was found in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we suggest another effect which proves to be very effective in the low - energy region .",
    "consider some nuclear reaction initiated by the collision of a pair of nuclei in a conventional beam - type nuclear experiment .",
    "suppose that the target nucleus is surrounded by other heavy nuclei .",
    "this happens when it is deposited in a molecule , in condensed matter , or in a plasma environment .",
    "the energy of the projectile is supposed to be lower than the coulomb barrier , and we are interested in the probability of a nuclear reaction",
    ". remember that the coulomb barrier makes the probability @xmath1 of the reaction depend exponentially on the relative velocity @xmath2 of the colliding pair @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the charges of the projectile and target nuclei , @xmath2 is their relative velocity .",
    "( here and afterwards the indexes @xmath5 and @xmath6 mark the velocities , momenta , and energies of the projectile and target nuclei , respectively . ) if we assume that the energy of the target nucleus @xmath7 is negligible , @xmath8 , then the collision velocity depends only on the energy of the projectile @xmath9 , making the probability ( [ prob ] ) depend exponentially on this energy .",
    "let us imagine now that there exists some mechanism which can split the same amount of energy between the two colliding nuclei .",
    "moreover , let us assume that this mechanism can also put the nuclei in a head on collision .",
    "then obviously the relative velocity may be larger .",
    "its possible maximum for a given energy @xmath10 is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the reduced mass for the pair of nuclei . for the collision of two deuterons @xmath13 ,",
    "then the maximum possible relative velocity @xmath14 is substantially larger than the initial velocity , @xmath15 .",
    "this increase of the relative velocity and a corresponding gain in the energy of the relative motion is due to reduction of the energy of the center of mass motion which was a half of the total energy in the initial projectile deuteron problem .",
    "eq.([prob ] ) shows that collision with the velocity @xmath16 makes the nuclear reaction much more probable .",
    "this simple observation inspires one to look for a mechanism which can fulfill two functions .",
    "firstly , it should force the projectile to share its energy with the target .",
    "secondly , it has to set the pair onto the collision course .",
    "the first goal can be achieved if we consider an _",
    "elastic _ scattering of the projectile on the target nucleus .",
    "this collision obviously transfers part of the projectile energy to the target and can substantially enlarge the relative velocity of the two nuclei .",
    "this event should be considered as a _",
    "preliminary _ collision , since we are seeking the possibility for the nuclear reaction to occur in the _ following _ inelastic collision .",
    "however , the necessary inelastic event can not happen by itself .",
    "after the elastic collision , the two nuclei move in opposite directions in the center - of - mass reference frame , and therefore can not collide again , at least this is impossible in the vacuum .",
    "the situation changes when the environment is present .",
    "the important point is that scattering of the considered colliding particles on nuclei of the environment can change the directions of their propagation . to simplify the consideration ,",
    "let us assume that the nuclei of the environment are much heavier than the colliding pair ( which is usually true for the most interesting case of light colliding nuclei ) .",
    "then , the scattering on nuclei of the environment does not change the energies of the target and projectile nuclei , but changes the directions of their velocities .",
    "these new velocities may put the pair on the collision course .",
    "there arises therefore a possibility for the second collision of the same projectile - target pair .",
    "a sketch in fig.[cartoon ] illustrates this idea .",
    "since this final collision happens with larger relative velocity , it can initiate the nuclear reaction with much higher probability .",
    "the picture described needs a chain of _ three elastic collisions _ ( tec ) .",
    "the initial elastic collision of the pair accelerates the target , then the two collisions of the target and projectile nuclei with different nuclei of the environment change the relative velocity of the pair in such a way that the final inelastic collision becomes possible .",
    "one can find some resemblance of this process with the cannon ( carambole ) shot in the billiards game .",
    "the collisions of the projectile and target nuclei with atoms of the environment can , generally speaking , result in ionization of these atoms .",
    "one can expect , however , that an energy loss due to ionization is much lower than the collision energy , provided the latter is higher than the atomic ionization potential .",
    "that is why even if the ionization happens , the nuclei can still move along the trajectories which lead to their final inelastic collision . in other words , it is sufficient for our purposes to assume that collisions with atoms a and b happen quasielastically .",
    "the colliding nuclei do not lose a substantial amount of their energy , but transfer a large momentum .    proposing the tec mechanism",
    ", we find that it greatly , by orders of magnitude , increases the probability of the nuclear reaction for a low projectile energy . in section [ wf ]",
    "we find the wave function for the colliding pair which takes into account tec . in sections [ amplit ] and [ proba ]",
    "we derive the amplitude and the probability of the nuclear reaction initiated by tec .",
    "section [ screen ] examines the role of screening , while in section [ num ] we present a numerical example which shows how effective the tec mechanism is for deuterium fusion .",
    "the maximum effect is achieved when the target deuterium is located at the center of the square formed by heavy atoms and the beam of projectile deuterons is parallel to the surface of this square .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ con ] .",
    "our goal is to find the wave function which takes into account tec .",
    "note firstly that each step of tec happens in some region , and the higher the collision energy , the more localized is the region . after each collision",
    "the active nucleus propagates a long distance before colliding again .",
    "fig.[cartoon ] illustrates this statement .",
    "this indicates that each of the tec collisions may be described in terms of the corresponding scattering amplitudes ( physical amplitudes , i.e. _ on mass shell _ amplitudes ) .",
    "let us call @xmath17 the scattering amplitude for the elastic collision of the projectile with the target nucleus , and @xmath18 the scattering amplitudes for collisions of the projectile nucleus with an atom @xmath19 and the target nucleus with an atom @xmath20 .",
    "we expect that the wave function of the target - projectile pair of nuclei which takes tec into account @xmath21 should be proportional to these amplitudes , @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , one can describe the propagation of the target and projectile nuclei in between the collisions in terms of the semiclassical approximation which is valid since the nuclei are heavy in comparison with electrons .",
    "therefore we need to find the classical trajectories which describe this propagation .",
    "this many - body problem can be greatly simplified if we assume that in between the elastic collisions nuclei propagate along straight lines .",
    "this requires that the collision energy satisfies @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the momentum and mass of the projectile nucleus , and @xmath25 are the charges of the projectile and target nuclei",
    ". condition ( [ qlarge ] ) is valid for any reasonable energy of the projectile .",
    "the relevant classical trajectories for both projectile and target nuclei start at some initial point @xmath26 , where the first projectile - target elastic collision takes place . from this point",
    "the projectile propagates with constant velocity @xmath27 to the point @xmath28 where an atom a is located , and then , after scattering , acquires the velocity @xmath29 and moves to the final point @xmath30 .",
    "similarly , the target moves from the point @xmath26 with the velocity @xmath31 towards an atom b located at @xmath32 and then with the velocity @xmath33 to the final point @xmath34 .",
    "[ feynman_d ] shows the feynman diagram which illustrates this discussion .",
    "obviously , the initial projectile - target collision preserves the total energy and momentum of the pair , while collisions of the projectile and target nuclei with atoms @xmath19 and @xmath20 preserve the absolute values of their momenta , provided the atoms a and b are sufficiently heavy .",
    "these classical conditions fix the classical trajectories for the projectile and target nuclei and allow one to express all relevant parameters , such as @xmath35 _ etc _ , as functions of the final coordinates @xmath36 and initial momenta @xmath37 of the projectile and target nuclei . from the classical trajectories",
    "one can construct the corresponding semiclassical wave function @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the classical action for the described trajectories , and @xmath40 is the corresponding pre - exponential factor .",
    "( [ fxxx ] ) takes into account the fact that the wave function should be proportional to the scattering amplitudes for tec . from the simple dimensional analysis",
    "we conclude that the only unknown parameter @xmath41 in ( [ fxxx ] ) should have the dimension of ( length)@xmath42 . the only available parameter of length in the problem is a separation of atoms @xmath43 in the condensed matter ( or molecule , or plasma ) environment .",
    "therefore we find an estimate @xmath44 , which agrees with the more involved calculations discussed below .    remember that we need the wave function in order to describe the final inelastic collision of the pair .",
    "this requires that the projectile and target nuclei eventually come to the same point @xmath45 , where the final collision takes place .",
    "therefore it is sufficient for us to consider the wave function only at this point , i.e. when @xmath46 .",
    "the method outlined above is discussed in detail for this specific case in appendix a. the found wave function ( [ psi3 ] ) has the form @xmath47 where the classical action @xmath39 is given by ( [ phasa ] ) .",
    "the wave function ( [ sc ] ) is proportional to the scattering amplitudes , as was anticipated ; the corresponding scattering angles @xmath48 can be found from the classical trajectories .",
    "the wave function is also inversely proportional to the factors @xmath49 , as it should be since the waves that describe the projectile and target nuclei at the final point @xmath45 originate from the points @xmath28 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the factor @xmath50 in the denominator is an effective distance describing the propagation of the projectile and target nuclei from their common initial point , @xmath26 to @xmath28 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "its explicit form is presented in eq .",
    "( [ rs  ] ) , but for our purposes it is sufficient to keep in mind that it is comparable with atomic separation @xmath51 the semiclassical wave function ( [ sc ] ) agrees with a simple estimate ( [ fs ] ) ,  ( [ fxxx ] ) .",
    "( [ sc ] ) is valid for the case when both the projectile and target nuclei in the initial state are described by plane waves .",
    "the validity of the plane wave approximation for the projectile nucleus is justified by its sufficiently high energy ( [ qlarge ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the motion of the target nucleus arises due to vibrations of this nucleus in a molecule or in condensed matter , or by temperature reasons in a plasma environment .",
    "therefore , generally speaking , the wave function of the target nucleus is not a plane wave .",
    "however , typical target momenta are small compared with the projectile momentum , @xmath52 this fact allows one to modify the approach outlined above to accommodate the vibration motion of the target nucleus .",
    "suppose that the target nucleus is described by the wave function @xmath53 in the initial state .",
    "consider an event in which the target nucleus possesses a momentum @xmath54 before the collision .",
    "the amplitude of this event equals the the fourier component of the target wave function , @xmath55 . multiplying ( [ sc ] ) by this amplitude , we find the contribution which this event gives to the wave function of the pair .",
    "integrating over all possible momenta of the target , we obtain the following wave function for the pair , @xmath56 that takes into account a distribution of the target momentum in the initial state .",
    "this approach , justified by inequality ( [ p2<p1 ] ) , is similar to the momentum approximation that is well known in nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "the semiclassical nature of the problem allows one to make the next step , fulfilling integration in ( [ 3sphi ] ) explicitly .",
    "note that according to ( [ p2<p1 ] ) only small momenta @xmath57 contribute to the integral .",
    "therefore we can consider the limit @xmath58 in the wave function @xmath59 . in this limit the classical action @xmath60 should be expanded in the taylor series @xmath61 where it is taken into account that the derivative of the classical action over the initial momentum gives the initial coordinate for the considered trajectory , @xmath62 higher derivatives , denoted by dots in ( [ ser ] ) , are negligible .",
    "the action is the only quantity in the wave function @xmath59 which needs to be considered accurately , using the series expansion . for other parameters one can simply take the limit @xmath63 . as a result",
    "we derive from ( [ ser ] ) @xmath64 substituting this into ( [ 3sphi ] ) we find the final expression for the wave function @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the wave function of the target nucleus calculated at the point @xmath26 , the latter one is a function of @xmath45 as is discussed above ( see also appendix a ) .",
    "( [ psi ] ) has a clear physical meaning . in order to set the tec mechanism in action",
    ", the initial collision of the projectile and target nuclei should happen at some particular initial point @xmath26 , starting from which the projectile and target propagate and undergo rescattering , arriving eventually at the final point @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the wave function of the pair should be proportional to the amplitude to find the target located at the point @xmath26 .",
    "this later amplitude is simply equal to the wave function of the target nucleus @xmath66 .",
    "since the momentum of the target is much smaller than that of the projectile , we can neglect in ( [ psi ] ) the initial slow motion of the target nucleus , and describe what happens after the initial collision with the help of the function @xmath67 .",
    "( [ psi ] ) , ( [ sc ] ) are the main result of this section .",
    "they present the wave function for the tec problem in terms of classical trajectories that describe the propagation of the projectile and target nuclei between the collisions , the scattering amplitudes responsible for the elastic collisions , and the wave function of the target nucleus .",
    "let us call @xmath68 the amplitude of the nuclear reaction initiated by a collision of the pair of nuclei with momenta @xmath69 and @xmath70 in a vacuum . according to ( [ prob ] ) this amplitude strongly depends on the collision velocity .",
    "it is convenient to account for this dependence by introducing the amplitude @xmath71 , @xmath72 here the exponential factor describes the under - barrier penetration through the coulomb barrier ( that strongly depends on the velocity @xmath73 ) , while @xmath71 describes the proper nuclear processes which happen afterwards .",
    "let us express the amplitudes of events which happen in the environment ( in condensed matter , molecules , _ etc _ ) in terms of the vacuum amplitude .",
    "consider first the _ direct _ collision of the projectile with the target , when one neglects preliminary elastic rescattering . in this case",
    "the wave function of the pair is simply a product of the incident plane wave describing the projectile nucleus and the target wave function , @xmath74 the amplitude of the _ direct _ nuclear reaction , in which the reaction products in the final state have momentum @xmath75 , can be written as @xmath76 here the integration over the coordinate with the weight @xmath77 ensures that the total momentum of the products of the nuclear reaction is equal to @xmath75 .",
    "let us now take the effect of tec into account .",
    "we need firstly to use the wave function ( [ psi ] ) which describes the amplitude of the event in which the inelastic collision happens at the point @xmath45 after tec .",
    "secondly , we need to multiply this amplitude by the amplitude of the nuclear reaction @xmath78 and , additionally , by the factor @xmath79 ( that again ensures that the products of the nuclear reaction have the total momentum @xmath75 ) . integrating the obtained result over the coordinate , we derive the following expression for the matrix element , @xmath80 the procedure used to derive this result is quite similar to the case of the direct collision ( [ m ] ) . the only important distinction is the wave function , which for the case ( [ 3 m ] ) accounts for tec .",
    "the momenta @xmath81 of the projectile and target nuclei arise due to tec and , henceforth , differ significantly from the initial momenta @xmath82 .",
    "this fact drastically changes the exponential factor in ( [ tun ] ) , as is discussed below .",
    "to calculate the total probability of the nuclear reaction , one needs to fulfill integration of the square of the amplitude over all possible momenta of the nuclear reaction products in the final state . for the direct collision",
    "this gives @xmath83 deriving the last identity we took into account the fact that according to ( [ p2<p1 ] ) the fourier component of the target wave function is localized in a region of small momenta .",
    "( [ wdir ] ) indicates that the probability of the nuclear reaction initiated by the direct collision in the environment is equal to the probability of the same event in the vacuum .",
    "consider now the probability of the nuclear reaction initiated by tec @xmath84 here the first identity takes into account ( [ 3 m ] ) rewriting the integration over the momenta @xmath85 as integration over the point of the final inelastic collision @xmath86 .",
    "the second identity presents the wave function @xmath87 explicitly using ( [ psi ] ) , ( [ sc ] ) , and ( [ tun ] ) .",
    "the velocity in the exponential factor , @xmath88 depends on the momenta @xmath89 of the projectile and target nuclei after tec .",
    "let us show that the major contribution to the integral over @xmath90 in ( [ d3q ] ) originates from the vicinity of a segment which connects @xmath28 and @xmath32 .",
    "consider instead of ( [ d3q ] ) an important relevant integral @xmath91 let us choose cylindrical coordinates with their origin at @xmath28 and the axis pointing along the vector @xmath92 .",
    "if we call @xmath93 the distance from the origin in the direction of this axis and @xmath94 the radius vector in the orthogonal plane , then the radius vector can be written as @xmath95 .",
    "the projectile and target nuclei after tec move along the segment @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "therefore the velocities in the cylindrical coordinate can be written as @xmath98 expanding in powers of @xmath99 , one presents the collision velocity as a function of the coordinates , @xmath100 we assume in ( [ v ] ) that @xmath93 belongs to the segment @xmath101 . in this region",
    "the collision velocity is large , therefore its contribution is significant . outside this region , when either @xmath102 or @xmath103 , the collision velocity is small , drastically reducing the integrand in ( [ i ] ) .    substituting ( [ v12  ] ) in ( [ i ] )",

    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath107 , defined as @xmath108 governs integration over @xmath109 in ( [ is ] ) .",
    "we consider low collision energies , therefore @xmath107 can be assumed to be so large that @xmath110 this inequality guarantees that separations from the @xmath93 axis which are essential in the integrand in ( [ is ] ) are small compared to the separation between nuclei @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath111 all essential parameters which govern the wave function ( including @xmath112 , _ etc _ ) depend , generally speaking , on the final point .",
    "however , in the vicinity of the @xmath93 axis their dependence on @xmath94 becomes insignificant , the only important dependence of the integrand on @xmath94 is the factor @xmath113 in the exponent .",
    "this greatly simplifies integration over @xmath114 in ( [ is ] ) , which results in @xmath115 a similar method applied to ( [ d3q ] ) gives @xmath116 here the momenta are defined for the head - on collision which happens on the segment connecting @xmath28 and @xmath32 , @xmath117 the scattering amplitudes in ( [ d3q ] ) are also defined for the head - on collision .",
    "notice that the probability ( [ d3q ] ) is proportional to the density @xmath118 of the target nucleus at the point of initial collision . to make the probability bigger , we need , therefore , to distinguish the case when the target nucleus is well localized in the condensed matter or molecular environment . in this ,",
    "most interesting for us , situation , further simplification of ( [ d3q ] ) becomes possible .",
    "when the target nucleus is localized we should suppose that the relevant classical trajectories , which describe propagation of the projectile and target nuclei , start from some point in the vicinity of the localization point .",
    "our previous results indicate that the trajectories finish at some point on the segment @xmath119 .",
    "these facts altogether fix the trajectories for the projectile and target nuclei uniquely . as a result",
    ", the angles in the scattering amplitudes as well as all velocities @xmath120 in the integrand in ( [ d3q ] ) can be considered as parameters defined for the given classical trajectories . in this case , the probability of the nuclear reaction initiated by tec @xmath121 , eq .",
    "( [ d3q ] ) , can be presented as @xmath122 where the coefficient is @xmath123 the factor @xmath124 , that appears in ( [ w3 ] ) and is defined in ( [ k ] ) , is the most important result of the calculations above .",
    "it can be conveniently rewritten in terms of the differential cross sections which describe tec , @xmath125 we introduce here the density of the target nucleus @xmath126 at the point of the initial elastic collision @xmath26 . in order to fulfill integration in ( [ kfin ] ) over the @xmath93 coordinate of the point of the final collision , one needs to remember that @xmath26 is a function of the point of the final collision @xmath45 , see discussion in section [ wf ] and appendix a. this integration can not be simplified any further in the general case , but it presents no difficulties for numerical estimations , see example in section [ num ] .",
    "the consideration above ignored the temperature of the target .",
    "if we assume that the temperature is lower than the projectile energy , @xmath127 , then by slightly modifying the approach above , we arrive at the same result ( [ kfin ] ) , with the density @xmath128 a function of the temperature .",
    "( [ kfin ] ) shows that each scattering process gives a factor into the probability which is identical to the elastic cross section ; that result could have been anticipated without any calculations .",
    "having established this , one could believe that an estimate for the pre - exponential factor should look like @xmath129 because the atomic separation @xmath119 seems to be the only relevant parameter in the problem .",
    "however , our calculations ( [ kfin ] ) reveal that there exists an additional enhancing factor @xmath130 , @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the maximum density of the target nucleus at the point of localization , and @xmath43 is the corresponding length which describes the region of localization .",
    "the latter one depends on the amplitude of vibrations exhibited by the target in the considered condensed matter or molecular environment .",
    "this length can usually be estimated as @xmath133 of an atomic separation @xcite , which justifies the last identity in ( [ kk ] ) . ) , the length of localization @xmath43 was assumed to be sufficiently large , @xmath134 , which is true for sufficiently high energy . ] eqs .",

    "we consider above a chain of scattering processes with the participation of atoms a and b , indicating this fact in the notation @xmath137 in ( [ kfin ] ) .",
    "if the process happens in large molecules , or in condensed matter , there may be several heavy atoms located close to the target nuclei .",
    "each of them provides the possibility for the necessary elastic rescattering .",
    "therefore , if we want to consider all possible rescattering processes we need simply to add the contributions arising from scattering on different neighbor nuclei .",
    "if the nucleus @xmath19 participates in the process then it gains a large momentum .",
    "therefore , the contributions from scattering on different nuclei do not interfere , and we need to sum the probabilities .",
    "the result again can be presented with the help of ( [ w3 ] ) , where the coefficient is @xmath138 the summation here runs over all neighbor nuclei of the environment .",

    "( [ tun ] ) .",
    "these latter factors vary on the scale of nuclear energies which are much higher than the collision energy .",

    "screening plays an essential role in low energy collisions of nuclei in condensed matter @xcite .",
    "let us summaries briefly relevant facts .",
    "when the two colliding nuclei come sufficiently close , their influence on the electrons of the environment can be described by their total coulomb charge @xmath145 .",
    "this charge for low energy collision creates discrete atomic - like energy levels for electrons .",
    "the electrons of the environment can populate these levels and form an effective atom around the _ combined _ nucleus .",
    "this is the strongest possible response which the electrons can exhibit in screening the coulomb field .",
    "an occupation of discrete levels in the combined atom results in energy production .",
    "the maximal energy produced in this process is equal to @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the total binding energy of the atom @xmath148 that has @xmath149 electrons surrounding the combined nucleus with nuclear charge @xmath149 , and @xmath150 is the binding energy for each electron in the given condensed matter environment .",
    "the energy variation @xmath151 can be transferred into the kinetic energy of the colliding nuclei .",
    "this transfer may be expected to be efficient for small collision velocity .",
    "eq.([energy ] ) shows that screening makes the collision energy higher @xmath152 .",
    "this , in turn , makes the relative velocity larger @xmath153 thus increasing the probability to penetrate through the coulomb barrier ( [ prob ] ) and boosting the nuclear event . screening in this description",
    "is described by the screening potential @xmath151 .",
    "the larger @xmath151 , the stronger is the screening and the higher is the probability of the nuclear reaction .",
    "it is clear that the given consideration may overestimate a role of screening because , firstly , a probability to populate the ground state of the effective atom should , generally speaking , be less than unity , and , secondly , because the energy production should not necessarily be transferred solemnly into the kinetic energy of the colliding nuclei , but may be used for excitation of the environment as well .",
    "these two factors could make screening potential less than what is predicted by ( [ energy ] ) .",
    "accurate account of all relevant factors is difficult and , probably , due to this reason ref .",
    "@xcite uses @xmath154 as a parameter to fit the experimental data .",
    "the above discussion shows that screening results in an increase of the relative velocity .",
    "this effect takes place in the direct collision as well as in the tec process . to take screening into account we need to increase velocities in both these collisions .",
    "applying this procedure to the relative probability ( [ ff ] ) of the nuclear process initiated by tec we find @xmath155~,\\ ] ] where @xmath156 and @xmath157 are defined in accord with ( [ rel ] ) @xmath158 it is clear that screening produces stronger impact for the direct collision because the relative velocity in this case is smaller than in the collision initialed by tec .",
    "therefore screening should reduce the relative probability @xmath159 ( [ rf ] ) in comparison with its non - screened value @xmath140 ( [ ff ] ) , see section [ num ] for more details .",
    "let us apply the results obtained above to the important case of deuterium fusion @xmath160 in a collision of the projectile deuterons with target deuterons implanted in a solid .",
    "( [ kfin ] ) shows that we need to estimate the cross sections for tec . for the initial deuteron - deuteron elastic collision one can use the conventional rutherford formulae",
    "@xmath161 where @xmath10 is the energy of the projectile deuteron and @xmath162 is the scattering angle in the center - of - mass reference frame . it should be noted that the target deuterium in a condensed matter environment can form a neutral atom ; the originally charged projectile nuclei propagating through the environment can also pick up an electron becoming neutral as well .",
    "thus , during the deuteron collision the charges of the nuclei are partly screened by the deuterons electrons .",
    "this fact , however , does not change estimate ( [ ru ] ) which assumes the pure coulomb interaction between the nuclei .",
    "the necessary significant variation of velocities of the deuterons requires that their collision should be sufficiently hard , i.e. happen with small impact parameter @xmath163 , @xmath164 .",
    "therefore , for energies higher than the atomic energy , @xmath165 ev , the impact parameter must be much smaller than the bohr radius , @xmath166 .",
    "the smallness of the impact parameter shows that screening produces a small effect for deuterium scattering .",
    "the same argument can be applied to the collision of a deuteron with a heavy atom .",
    "electrons located at the deuteron nucleus or in an outer shell of the heavy atom can not produce any significant effect because major events during the scattering happen for small separation between the deuteron nucleus and the nucleus of the heavy atom .. the collision with the heavy atom can , generally speaking , be accompanied by ionization of the heavy atom or the deuteron atom .",
    "however , the ionization process involves an outer shell of the heavy atom or the deuteron atom .",
    "this means that the ionization happens when the deuteron nucleus is separated by a large distance @xmath167 from the heavy atom nucleus .",
    "in contrast , large variation of the velocity of the deuteron nucleus happens at small separations , where ionization does not play a role .",
    "we conclude again that scattering with ionization can be considered as a quasi - elastic process which does not affect significantly the collision with large variation of the deuteron velocity . ]",
    "the above arguments are valid for an outer shell of the heavy atom .",
    "in contrast , electrons of inner shells are localized closer to the nucleus and therefore produce a strong effect , providing screening for the coulomb field created by the heavy nuclei for those small separations which are responsible for the scattering .",
    "the screening can be conveniently taken into account in the semiclassical approximation , the validity of which is justified by the large mass and energy of a deuteron . in this approach",
    "one needs firstly to calculate the deuteron scattering angle as a function of the impact parameter @xmath168 @xcite , @xmath169 then the cross section is found from the conventional relation @xcite @xmath170 we perform these calculations using the well - known thomas - fermi atomic potential @xcite for the atomic potential energy @xmath171 .",
    "[ cross ] presents results for deuteron scattering from gold atoms .",

    "[ rfactor ] data which show variation of the enhancing factor @xmath140 both on the collision energy and the screening potential @xmath151 .",
    "we see that for collision energies below @xmath193 ev the ratio @xmath140 becomes large , @xmath194 , showing that the tec makes the probability of the nuclear reaction bigger than in the direct inelastic collision . for lower energies",
    "this enhancement becomes stronger .",
    "screening makes the nuclear reaction more probable , but it results in the decrease of the relative probability probability @xmath140 for processes initiated by tec .",
    "this damping effect arises because screening manifests itself stronger for the direct process , in which the collision energy is lower .",
    "the stronger screening , i.e. the higher the potential @xmath151 is , the less important role plays the tec mechanism .",
    "the analysis above assumes that the solid state environment keeps the target deuteron localized in the center of a square which is cornered by heavy atoms , and the beam of the projectile deuterons moves parallel to some side of this square .",
    "this geometry is the most favorable because it provides an enhancement factor ( [ en ] ) . for an arbitrary geometry ,",
    "the enhancement ( [ en ] ) does not take place , making the probability of tec lower by a factor of @xmath195 .",
    "we conclude that the fusion below 500 ev is strongly influenced by the tec mechanism .",
    "we have demonstrated that there is a boost in the probability of a nuclear reaction , in a condensed matter or molecular environment , when three elastic collisions ( tec ) precede the inelastic collision of two nuclei . when operative , the tec mechanism provides an _ exponential enhancement _ for nuclear reactions with low collision - energy .",
    "one should remember , however , that this boost does not fully compensate for the suppression due to the coulomb repulsion .",
    "it accounts , roughly speaking , for only @xmath196 ( @xmath197 , see ( [ rr ] ) ) of the exponent which describes tunneling through the coulomb barrier , leaving @xmath198 of this exponent intact .",
    "moreover , the compensation originates from a chain of several ( three ) collisions which produces an additional pre - exponential , but nevertheless important , damping factor .",
    "additionally , screening also reduces the role played by tec . as a result of this",
    "we find that the probability for a nuclear reaction is enhanced by tec only for sufficiently low collision energies .",
    "an example of dd fusion discussed in section [ num ] demonstrates that the effect of tec manifests itself strongly for energies below 500 ev , being negligible for higher energies .",
    "obviously , in this low energy region the probability of fusion is very low , by a factor of @xmath199 lower than for the energy 2 kev .",
    "this should make direct measurement of the discussed effect very difficult in the near future .    nevertheless , the effect results in a strong boost for low - energy nuclear reactions which may be important for different applications",
    ". one of them can be looked for in laser - induced fusion , in which ions can be accelerated by the laser field , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this acceleration can , generally speaking , create a flux of deuterons which move from a surface inside a target exposed to a laser field . if these ions have energies below @xmath200 kev , than the tec mechanism can boost the fusion .",
    "one can deduce a practical conclusion from this . to allow the tec mechanism to manifest itself in laser - induced fusion",
    ", the deuterium target should contain a sufficient amount of heavy atoms .",
    "one can look for other applications of the tec mechanism , for example , in astrophysics .",
    "let us derive the wave function which describes the projectile and target nuclei with tec taken into account .",
    "this goal can be achieved with the help of the feynman diagram presented in fig .",

    "show the projectile and target nuclei .",
    "their propagation in the intermediate states should be described with the help of the corresponding green functions @xmath201 .",

    "the important point is that each step of tec happens inside some localized region , each collision being well separated from other ones . as a result , each step of tec can be described by a physical ( `` on mass shell '' ) scattering amplitude .",
