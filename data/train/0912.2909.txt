    "convergence of expansions of a one - component function into a series of eigenfunctions of a sturm  liouville problem was a subject of many studies .",
    "in some physical situations @xcite , of particular interest are expansions of a function defined only on a finite and closed interval .",
    "the classical results on convergence of such series can be found , for instance , in @xcite and for modern studies on this type of problems , including the equiconvergence method , the reader is referred to @xcite and references therein .",
    "a similar problem for a two - component function was addressed by a number of mathematicians at the beginning of the 20th century @xcite and later reviewed in numerous textbooks ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , very few articles and textbooks deal with the development of an arbitrary function on a closed interval . usually ,",
    "either the expansion on an open interval is studied only or some additional conditions are imposed on the expanded function at the boundary points . to the best of the author",
    "s knowledge , the only classical paper discussing the general situation is the one by birkhoff and langer @xcite .",
    "a more recent analysis of this kind of problems can be found , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "a generalization of the equiconvergence method @xcite to a vector case should be also possible .",
    "in the present paper , we apply the general results concerning convergence of eigenfunction expansions in the context of the @xmath0-matrix theory of scattering processes .",
    "this theory was first developed for low - energy collisions that could be described with the schrdinger equation @xcite ( see @xcite for reviews on the subject ) .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix theory for the dirac equation @xcite was formulated soon after the nonrelativistic one , with nuclear applications in view .",
    "only later it was realized that the electron ",
    "atom collisions involving targets with large atomic numbers require a dirac description , due to the increasing role of relativistic effects .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix theory was reinvestigated in this context in @xcite .",
    "the central idea in the formulation of the @xmath0-matrix methods for scattering from spherically symmetric potentials is to divide the whole space into two regions , a finite reaction volume @xmath1 and the outer region @xmath2 , and to expand a wave function in the inner region in a series of eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian governing the scattering process augmented , however , by _ artificial boundary conditions _ at the point @xmath3 .",
    "this procedure allows one to express the @xmath0-matrix as a limit @xmath4 of an infinite functional series . in both nonrelativistic and relativistic theories the critical issue ,",
    "the convergence of the series on the boundary , was not properly analyzed by the originators and only presumed to hold .",
    "the convergence question was first recognized by rosenthal @xcite , however his conclusions were incorrect .",
    "later szmytkowski and hinze @xcite realized that while the development of the solution in the schrdinger formulation converges in the whole interval to an _ expanded _ function , the analogous series appearing in the relativistic case has a discontinuity at the crucial boundary point .",
    "in this way , in the most popular formulation of the method , the solution depends on the _ artificial _ boundary condition imposed on the basis functions . taking this into account , szmytkowski and hinze developed the correct dirac @xmath0-matrix theory .",
    "their conclusion caused much controversy @xcite and was not widely recognized by the community @xcite .",
    "we present here a theorem confirming their results as well as the general result on convergence obtained by szmytkowski @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ expansions ] , we recall basic facts from both nonrelativistic and relativistic @xmath0-matrix theories to highlight the problem of convergence appearing in both of them . in section [ convergence ] , we give the general convergence theorems concerning the eigenfunction expansions @xcite .",
    "the main result of the paper , a solution to the dirac @xmath0-matrix puzzle based on the theorem by birkhoff and langer @xcite , can be found in section [ convergence ] .",
    "we finish the paper with conclusions and point out some open problems .",
    "the nonrelativistic and relativistic theories share many similarities , however in one essential point they are very different , i.e. the eigenfunction expansion of the solution of a nonrelativistic wave equation converges to a continuous function , whereas an analogous series in the relativistic theory has a discontinuity at the crucial boundary point @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the relativistic @xmath0-matrix is not appropriately expressed by a functional series . to highlight this difference",
    ", we shortly introduce both methods in a single - channel scattering from spherically symmetric potentials .",
    "the notation used in the following sections is based on the monograph on the @xmath0-matrix methods in scattering @xcite .",

    "the particle is free and its wave function satisfies the free - hamiltonian stationary schrdinger equation .",
    "obviously , the solution in the inner region must pass smoothly into the solution in the outer region .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the wave function being the solution of the respective schrdinger equations in the inner and outer regions .",
    "since the potential is spherically symmetric , it is enough to consider only the radial part of the function @xmath11 corresponding to the multiindex @xmath12 . for a general function @xmath13 , it is defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are normalized spherical harmonics defined as in @xcite .",

    "we consider the radial part of the schrdinger equation in the inner region @xmath10 : @xmath26 we emphasize that here we do _ not _ make any restrictions on the function , except that it vanishes for @xmath9 as @xmath27 .",

    ", we immediately see that the expansion ( [ exp_dir ] ) for @xmath3 does not , in general , converge to the solution of ( [ dir_rad ] ) .",
    "it does only if the functions @xmath18 and @xmath62 satisfy the second of the boundary conditions ( [ dir_eig_bc ] ) .",
    "this , however , can not be assumed since this particular condition does not have any physical meaning and is chosen in this way only to obtain the expansion of the @xmath0-matrix . as a result , the commonly used definition of the @xmath0-matrix contains an error , since in general it holds that @xmath187 the way to correct this mistake was found by szmytkowski and hinze for a general multichannel case @xcite .",
    "they introduced the correction which should by subtracted from the common and faulty expression for the @xmath0-matrix in order to obtain the correct one .",
    "summarizing , we have provided theorems concerning the convergence of eigenfunction expansions of a two - component function into eigenfunctions of a dirac operator on a finite closed interval augmented by separated boundary conditions . in particular , we have shown that such expansions have discontinuities at the boundary if the expanded function does not fulfill the same boundary conditions as the basis functions .",
    "this confirms the result of szmytkowski @xcite and has far - reaching consequences for the relativistic @xmath0-matrix method .",
    "moreover , the fact that the functional series does not , in general , converge to a continuous function in the closed interval may affect the rate of convergence and cause the gibbs - like phenomenon @xcite to occur .",
    "the issue left as an open problem is the proof of convergence of ( [ cor_exp ] ) in the case when the functions @xmath188 have a singularity at one of the boundary points , e.g. at @xmath92 .",
    "this is directly related to convergence of expansion ( [ exp_dir ] ) since the functions have discontinuities for @xmath9 . however , due to the separated character of the boundary conditions ( [ cor_bv ] ) and the fact that both the expanded function and the basis functions vanish at @xmath9 , the conclusions ( [ cor_lim1 ] ) and ( [ cor_lim3 ] ) of corollary [ dirac_cor ] should hold even in this case .",
