    "in the last few years , the study of complex networks has found relevance in various fields including sociology , ecology , biology , economics and physics . in these networks , vertices do not have homogeneous links or connectivities .",
    "a particularly relevant structure found in several empirical studies is the so - called _ scale - free network _ ( sfn ) , which is characterized by the power law distribution of the degree of connectivities , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 the number of links for a node , and @xmath8 the decay exponent of the distribution .",
    "a network with @xmath9 has nodes with a relatively homogeneous number of links ( somewhat resembling the case on regular lattices ) , while large @xmath8 corresponds to the existence of `` very famous '' nodes ( or hubs ) , i.e. , those having direct links to the majority of vertices .",
    "many networks realized in nature show scale - free structure .",
    "some examples studied include food webs  @xcite , power grids and neural networks  @xcite , cellular networks  @xcite , sexual contacts  @xcite , internet routers  @xcite , the world wide web  @xcite , actor collaborations  @xcite , the citation network of scientists  @xcite and the stock market  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the scale - free behaviour , these networks are characterized by a high clustering coefficient , @xmath10 , in comparison with random graphs  @xcite .",
    "the clustering coefficient , @xmath10 , is computed as the average of local clustering , @xmath11 , for the @xmath12 node , defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the total number of nodes linked to the site @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the total number of links between those nodes . as",
    "a consequence both @xmath11 and @xmath10 lie in the interval [ 0,1 ] .",
    "the high level of clustering found supports the idea that a _ herding _ phenomenon is a common feature in social and biological communities .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 also represents the density of triangles , that is of elementary cells , associated with the network .",
    "numerical studies on sfns have demonstrated how topology plays a fundamental role in infection spreading  @xcite , opinion formation in large communities  @xcite and tolerance against random and preferential node removal  @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the progress in this emerging field of statistical mechanics can be found in the recent reviews of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the aforementioned empirical findings have inspired physicists to investigate the dynamics of standard models in the new case where the interactions between elements are described by complex networks .",
    "these include the study of various magnetic models such as the ising model .",
    "an intriguing issue concerns how the unusual topology acts to influence the cooperative behaviour of the spins .",
    "studies of the ferromagnetic ( fm ) ising model on a sfn , using several theoretical techniques  @xcite including the monte carlo ( mc ) method  @xcite , have found the robustness of ferromagnetic ordering against thermal fluctuations for the degree distribution exponent @xmath17 .",
    "this result is actually intuitive if we notice that , as @xmath8 gets smaller , nodes at the edge of the network will generally have more connections . in this situation ,",
    "the system resembles the fm ising model on a regular lattice which exceeds the lower critical spatial dimension , @xmath18 .",
    "there the ordered phase is very robust against thermal fluctuations .",
    "however , for the antiferromagnetic ( af ) case with a sfn , the situation is different .",
    "two factors come to play a central role in the dynamics of the af - sfn model ; namely the competition induced by the af interaction in the elementary triangles of the network and the randomness related to the non - regular connections .",
    "the abundance of elementary triangles in the network leads to frustration , as , for example , only two of the three spins can be anti - aligned .",
    "more generally , frustration refers to the inability of the system to remain in a single lowest energy state ( ground state ) .",
    "these ingredients lead the af sfn to belong to a class of randomly frustrated systems commonly referred to as spin glasses ( sgs ) .",
    "most studies of sgs have been performed on regular lattices .",
    "these studies have shown that frustration and randomness are the key ingredients for sg behavior , characterized by a frozen random spin orientation at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "spin glasses on a sfn with mixed af and fm bonds have been investigated recently by kim _",
    "et al . _",
    "they found , for @xmath19 and even distributions of the two kinds of interaction , that the system is always in a sg state for any finite temperature .",
    "a study of the pure af ising model on a sfn is of great theoretical interest since , despite the homogeneity of the bonds , it inherits all the characteristics of a sg from the random frustration related to its geometry .",
    "general reviews on sg systems can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the af ising model on a sfn , more precisely the barab@xmath20si - albert ( ba ) network with tunable clustering  @xcite .",
    "using the replica exchange algorithm  @xcite of the monte carlo method , we calculate the order parameters of spin glass behaviour , the so - called overlap parameter and its distribution . for an accurate determination of the critical temperature , we also evaluate the binder parameter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ two ] describes the model and the method .",
    "the results are discussed in section  [ three ] .",
    "section  [ four ] is devoted to the concluding remarks .",
    "in order to create the scale - free network topology we make use of the barab@xmath21si - albert model  @xcite .",
    "this is based on two main considerations : ( i ) linear growth and ( ii ) preferential attachment . in practice",
    "the network is initialized with @xmath22 disconnected nodes . at each step a new node with @xmath23 edges",
    "is added to the pre - existing network .",
    "the probability that an edge of the new node is linked with the @xmath15th node is expressed by @xmath24 .",
    "the iteration of this preferential growing process yields a scale free network , where the probability of having a node with @xmath7 connections is @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "this is an interesting value . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "the second moment of the distribution diverges , @xmath27 , for @xmath19 .",
    "this leads to peculiar properties of theoretical models in this range of @xmath8 values  @xcite . in the present work we focus on the case",
    "in which @xmath26 and the divergence of @xmath28 is logarithmic .",
    "an extensive investigation of the phase space for the af model on sfn is left for future work .",
    "it is also worth noting that the barab@xmath21si - albert model can not reproduce a high clustering coefficient .",
    "in fact , the value of this coefficient depends on the total number of nodes , @xmath29 , in the network  @xcite and in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .    in the af ising system the average cluster coefficient , @xmath10 ,",
    "plays a fundamental role in the dynamics .",
    "in fact , it represents the average number of triangles per node and , as a result , it is directly related to the degree of frustration in the network . in order to keep this parameter constant , on average , with the size of the network",
    ", we introduce a further step in the growth process , namely the triad formation proposed by holme and kim  @xcite . in this case , if the new added node is linked with an older node , @xmath15 , having other links , then with a certain probability , @xmath32 , the next link of the new node , if any remain , will be added to a randomly selected neighbour of node @xmath15 .",
    "this method of introducing friends to friends , while preserving the scale - free nature of the networks with @xmath33 , generates high clustering coefficients that do not depend on @xmath29 .",
    "the only tunable parameter that changes the value of the clustering coefficient is the _ clustering probability _ @xmath32 .",
    "an example of a sf network generated with this algorithm is shown in fig .",
    "[ netplot ] for 500 nodes .",
    "we simulate various sizes of the network with many different realizations and investigate the scaling behaviour of the various physical quantities we are interested in .",
    "all the simulations have been carried out fixing @xmath34 , corresponding to an average clustering coefficient of @xmath35 , close to the value found in many real systems @xcite . on each sfn constructed at the beginning of the simulation",
    ", we assign to each vertex an ising spin , and to each link an af interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as follows @xmath36 here the summation is performed over the connected spins @xmath37 and @xmath38 occupying sites @xmath15 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the coupling interaction @xmath40 is af . as previously mentioned ,",
    "each vertex with the local cluster coefficient @xmath41 together with its neighbours , compose elementary triangles . due to the af interactions",
    "the local system is frustrated .",
    "it is worth pointing out that @xmath10 is related to the degree of frustration of each network . due to the probabilistic algorithm used for their construction",
    ", the value of @xmath10 fluctuates around a mean value from one network to the next and , therefore , provides a source of randomness that , as we will see , gives rise to the spin glass properties of the model .",
    "this probabilistic growth is not shared by other algorithms which use recursion formulas to generate scale - free structures , such as , for example , the apollonian networks  @xcite . in this case , once one fixes the number of iterations of the algorithm , which is proportional to the number of nodes of the final network , one also fixes its topology .",
    "the element of randomness is therefore missing in the apollonian procedure .    as a random system ,",
    "each realization of a network of size @xmath29 will differ in the `` structure '' of connectivities .",
    "therefore , in order to have reliable statistics , we average over many realizations of the sf network for each specified size",
    ". the system sizes that we simulate are @xmath42 1024 , 2048 , 4096 , and 8192 . in general , one takes into account more realizations for small system sizes and less for large system sizes as the latter tend to self - average .",
    "however , since the self - averaging of physical quantities for larger system sizes is interfered with by the increase of ground state degeneracy , we do not take less realizations .",
    "instead all physical quantities of interest for each system size are averaged over 1000 network realizations . moreover , for each realization of the network , we fix @xmath43 , corresponding to a coordination number on a regular lattice of approximately 10 . in the thermodynamic limit , the average connectivity for the ba network is @xmath44 , emphasizing the fact that we are implicitly dealing with a high dimensional system .",
    "another peculiarity of sf networks is the existence of a broad distribution of `` hubs '' , that is nodes with a large number of connections , @xmath7 .",
    "the energy difference in a spin flip actually depends on the number of connections of the spin itself , @xmath45 .",
    "thus in the af case for the @xmath15th spin with @xmath46 connections , the hubs are more likely to `` freeze '' into a particular configuration compared to the nodes with just a few links .",
    "this property resembles the spin glass behaviour of particular alloys where some elements freeze into a particular orientation at a higher temperature than others .",
    "the calculation of the thermal averages of the physical quantities of interest is performed using the replica exchange mc method  @xcite . in this method",
    "the evolution of @xmath47 replicas , each in equilibrium with a heat bath of inverse temperature @xmath48 for the @xmath49 replica , is simulated in parallel . given a set of inverse temperatures , @xmath50 ,",
    "the probability distribution of finding the whole system in a state @xmath51 is @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the partition function at the @xmath49 temperature .",
    "we can then define an exchange matrix between the replicas in our markov chain , @xmath55 , that is the probability to switch the configuration @xmath56 at the temperature @xmath48 with the configuration @xmath57 at @xmath58 . by using the detailed balance condition , required to keep the entire system at equilibrium , on the transition matrix @xmath59 along with eq .",
    "( [ equil ] ) , we have that @xmath60 where @xmath61 . with the above",
    "constrains we can choose the matrix coefficients according to the standard metropolis method and , therefore , we have @xmath62 in our simulation we restrict the exchange to temperatures next to each other ; that is , we consider only the terms @xmath63 .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that the acceptance ratio decays exponentially with @xmath64 .",
    "the replica exchange method is extremely efficient for simulating systems such as spin glasses , that can otherwise become frozen in some particular configuration at low temperatures when using a standard metropolis algorithm for the configuration update . in this case ,",
    "as we lower the temperature , the system can become trapped into a local minimum of the free - energy where the barriers are so high that the time required for the system to move to another allowed region of the configuration space diverges to infinity as a function of the system size .",
    "if the system is trapped in a local minimum then the ergodicity condition is not fulfilled anymore and the measure that one makes become biased by the particular region of the configuration space that is being sampled . by using the exchange replica method , instead",
    ", we keep switching the temperatures between the @xmath47 copies of the system and , as long as the higher temperature is in a hot phase ( where , the system can easily explore all the configuration space ) , then we are in principle able to explore all the configuration space also for the lower temperatures .",
    "another advantage of this method is that the replica exchange reduces drastically the temporal correlation in the system dynamics at each temperature .",
    "this enables one to collect more independent measures for the thermal averages of the physical quantities and , therefore , reduces the uncertainty .",
    "it is important to stress that , before starting the actual simulations , some care is required in selecting the set of inverse temperatures , @xmath50 . in fact , the method is efficient only when a fairly large transition probability is maintained in the range of interest . from eq .",
    "[ trans ] , we can see that , in the hot phase , temperatures can be more coarsely spaced while in the cold phase the temperatures need to be closer to each other .",
    "an optimal set of temperatures can be obtained by iterating , in preliminary runs , the following map  @xcite : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the acceptance ratio for the switch between two configurations at the @xmath23th temperature and @xmath67 is a normalization factor .",
    "the initial value for the set @xmath50 is uniform in the interval of interest and we ensure that @xmath68 belongs to the hot phase . for each iteration of the map , a run of a few thousand mc steps is carried out to calculate the acceptance ratios , @xmath69 , which are then plugged into eq .",
    "( [ map ] ) in order to obtain a new set of inverse temperatures .",
    "after a few iterations , the map of eq .",
    "( [ map ] ) converges to a fixed point , @xmath70 , which sets the values of the temperatures to be used in our simulations .    in using this method",
    ", we define a `` local '' mc ( lmc ) update as a mc update for each spin of each replica , either consecutively through all elements of the network or randomly .",
    "given that we can group the inverse temperatures in even and odd pairs , @xmath71 , after each lmc update we alternate attempts to switch configurations from one temperature to the next . according to this procedure",
    ", we define a monte carlo step ( mcs ) as a lmc plus a half ( @xmath23 odd or even ) exchange trial .    for each realization of the network",
    "we start from a random configuration of the spins and then perform @xmath72 lmc updates in order to reach thermal equilibrium . after this transient period",
    ", we run the simulation for @xmath73 mcss while taking a total of @xmath74 measures for the thermal averages , that is one every 5 mcss ( temporal correlations are lost very quickly by using the replica exchange method ) .",
    "we consider low temperatures in a search for the possible existence of a phase transition .",
    "the thermal averages obtained for each network are then averaged over the ensemble of networks . in the following ,",
    "we indicate @xmath75 as the thermal average and @xmath76_{\\rm av}$ ] as the ensemble average .",
    "the statistical errors in the plots , where reported , are calculated via the bootstrap method .",
    "as a first step we investigate the extent of spatial correlation of the spins in the sf network by making use of the spatial autocorrelation function which is defined on a regular lattice as @xmath77_{\\rm av } , \\label{spat_corr}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the total number of pairs at distance @xmath79 and depends just on the dimension considered . in a sf network the situation is more complicated since there may be several paths leading from a certain node to another .",
    "we then define @xmath79 as the _ minimum _ path between two nodes and the denominator of the eq .",
    "( [ spat_corr ] ) becomes dependent on @xmath79 .",
    "the results , averaged over 50 configurations , between the temperatures of @xmath80 and @xmath81 are shown in fig .",
    "[ sp_corr ] for @xmath82 .",
    "all the temperatures in the present paper are expressed in units of @xmath83 , where @xmath3 is the coupling strength between spins and @xmath4 is the boltzmann constant .    in order to give a better interpretation of the plot in fig .",
    "[ sp_corr ] we remind the reader about an important propriety of sf networks ; that is their `` small world structure '' .",
    "the `` hubs '' , in fact , play a fundamental role in linking sites otherwise very distant .",
    "moreover , the average path length increases just logarithmically with the size of the network  @xcite . in the plot of fig .",
    "[ sp_corr ] , for @xmath82 nodes , an upper limit of @xmath84 is encountered .",
    "while all the 50 configurations reach @xmath84 , only a few networks exceed this limit .",
    "the plot emphasizes how neighboring spins , on average , tend to be anti - correlated , as expected in the af case .",
    "the autocorrelation decreases with the distance from the node under consideration .",
    "the temperature dependence is also in accord with the expectations .",
    "the absolute value of the correlation decreases with increasing temperature and vice versa .",
    "indeed , the highest and lowest temperatures form a perfect boundary for all the curves .",
    "this is an expected result , since thermal effects always tend to reduce the correlation between the spin interactions .",
    "we also study the behaviour of the specific heat , @xmath85 , defined as follows @xmath86_{\\rm av},\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "although no singularity is expected for this quantity in the spin - glass transition , it is interesting to compare its behaviour with other studies .",
    "the dependence of the specific heat on temperature is reported in fig .",
    "[ sp_heat ] .",
    "the statistical errors , in this case , are smaller than the size of the symbols and therefore are not reported .",
    "a common schottky peak of the specific heat for a finite system is observed at the temperature of @xmath88 independent of the system size .",
    "below this point , we found that @xmath89 decreases and goes to zero as @xmath90 .",
    "this behaviour follows from simple entropy considerations .",
    "in fact , since we are dealing with a finite ising system , the entropy is bounded at each finite temperature as well , @xmath91 and , necessarily , @xmath92 for @xmath90 .",
    "the next section is dedicated to study of the sg behaviour and the phase transition of the system . in order to achieve this task",
    ", we evaluate the corresponding order parameters , the overlap parameter and the binder parameter .      with the presence of frustration and randomness in the af - sfn model",
    ", we expect to observe a spin glass transition , i.e. , a transition from a temporal disordered to a temporal ordered phase at low temperatures .",
    "this feature is not shared by the so - called fully frustrated systems  @xcite .",
    "this type of transition might be characterized by the order parameter such as that suggested by edward and anderson  @xcite , defined as follows @xmath93_{\\rm av}.\\ ] ] however , an ergodic markov chain of a system having @xmath94 symmetry will ensure the thermal average of the @xmath15th spin vanishes .",
    "therefore a finite value of this measure simply reflects the non - ergodicity in the mc update .    a more appropriate quantity that is often used to characterize the sg state is the overlap parameter , @xmath95 , defined as  @xcite @xmath96 where the superscripts @xmath97 and @xmath98 denote two copies of the same configuration of connectivity at the same temperature .",
    "the actual value of @xmath95 is extracted from both the thermal and disorder average , @xmath99_{\\rm av}$ ] .    using the replica exchange mc simulation , the two copies , @xmath97 and @xmath98 ,",
    "are allocated at each temperature of the parallel tempering .",
    "this means , if the measurement is performed on @xmath47 points of temperatures , there are @xmath47 pairs of replicas .",
    "the metropolis spin update is performed on each node for every mc step . as a part of the equilibration steps of the algorithm described in the previous section",
    ", we exchange two @xmath97 ( and @xmath98 ) replicas of neighboring temperatures , according to a certain probability .",
    "then , for each temperature , the @xmath97 and @xmath98 replicas are superimposed every 5 mcss in order to measure the overlap parameters , as defined in eq.([qorder ] ) .    in particular , for the ising system , due to the @xmath94 symmetry",
    ", it is important to evaluate the absolute value of the order parameter , @xmath100_{\\rm av},\\ ] ] to overcome the implication of the @xmath94 symmetry of the hamiltonian , that is the configurations @xmath101 and @xmath102 have equal boltzmann weights .",
    "that is , if the system is at thermal equilibrium and if we take quite long mcs then the usual @xmath95 should average to zero .",
    "the existence of a spin glass phase is indicated by the convergence of @xmath103 to a finite value as we increase the network size . at the same time , a convergence of @xmath103 to zero at high temperatures is anticipated . in the latter case the system is in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath103 , resulting from the simulations , is shown in fig .",
    "[ overlap ] .",

    "we note that the shape of the observed distribution at low temperatures is different from that of the conventional ising system where the double peaks approach delta - like double peaks reflecting a simple doubly degenerate ground state  @xcite .    an accurate evaluation of critical temperature of the phase transition is achieved via the binder parameter defined as follows @xmath105_{\\rm av}}{\\left[\\langle q^2\\rangle \\right]_{\\rm av}^{2}}\\right).\\ ] ] here @xmath106 and @xmath107 are respectively the second and the fourth cumulant moment of @xmath95 . in this calculation , in order to avoid systematic correlation errors that could bias the results if we were evaluating this average over @xmath108 directly  @xcite , the second and fourth order cumulants are averaged prior to taking their ratio .",
    "the binder parameter is constrained in the range @xmath109 . at high temperature , where thermal fluctuations overcome all cooperative interaction ,",

[ binder ] ( inset ) displays the temperature dependence of the binder parameter for a variety of network sizes . a spin - glass state is observed for lower temperatures where the binder parameter deviates from zero , and increases with the system size while approaching to 1 . in the thermodynamic limit",

    "a crossing point in the size dependence of @xmath108 indicates that the critical temperature for the sg phase transition is @xmath115 .",

    ". an important implication of this feature is that we can not embed the network in any finite dimensional lattice : we are implicitly dealing with a high dimensional system .",
