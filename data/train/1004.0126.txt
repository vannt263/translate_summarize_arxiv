    "bilayer ( _ bl _ ) graphene has unique electronic properties and its chiral quasiparticles with parabolic dispersion make it different from both single layer ( _ sl _ ) graphene and bulk graphite  @xcite .",

    "also the possibility of some exotic many body phenomena , such as pseudospin magnetism  @xcite have been discussed . for these reasons , _ bl _ graphene is currently subject of great interest .",
    "however the knowledge of its structural properties is still very poor .",
    "it was shown experimentally that , _ bl _ graphene is also corrugated  @xcite like _ sl _ graphene , but no systematic study has been carried out .",
    "this corrugation ( ripples ) may constitute an important scattering mechanism for electrons  @xcite and ripples can give rise to charge inhomogeneities ( electron and hole puddles )  @xcite .",
    "although important for their relation to electronic properties , the structural properties of _ bl _ graphene are also important from the point of view of statistical mechanics since the _ bl _ graphene is a unique realization of crystalline membranes formed by two atomic layers .",
    "assessing the structure of a _ bl _ graphene is experimentally challenging and theoretical calculations can be particularly helpful . since the observed corrugations are on a scale much larger than interatomic distances , ab - initio simulations are not feasible .",
    "this interesting range of lengths ( e.g. for electron interactions with ripples ) is , however , not necessarily well described by continuum medium theories  @xcite .",
    "atomistic simulations based on accurate empirical interaction potentials are particularly suitable for this purpose .",
    "we have recently studied the structural and thermodynamic properties of _ sl _ graphene  @xcite by monte carlo ( _ mc _ ) simulations based on the lcbopii bond order potential  @xcite . here",
    "we present the results of similar calculations for _ bl _ graphene , where a new aspect related to the correlation of atomic displacements in different layers arises .",
    "we perform _ mc _ simulations in the @xmath3 ensemble at pressure @xmath4 and temperature @xmath5 with periodic boundary conditions for samples of @xmath6 and @xmath7 atoms per layer . when not specified , the presented results are for the largest sample .",
    "the equilibrium size at @xmath8  k of the @xmath6 sample is @xmath9  nm in @xmath10 and @xmath11  nm in @xmath12 direction and that of the @xmath7 sample is @xmath13  nm and @xmath14  nm .",
    "the finite size of our sample defines the lowest accessible wavevectors is @xmath10 and @xmath12 directions as @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "motivated by the results of recent quantum _ mc _ calculations  @xcite , we have slightly modified the long - range part of lcbopii as to have an interlayer binding energy of @xmath17  mev / atom against the @xmath18  mev / atom of the parametrization of ref .  , while keeping the interlayer compressibility constant .",
    "we equilibrate the sample for at least @xmath19 steps ( @xmath20 _ mc _ step corresponds to @xmath21 attempts to a coordinate change ) , using the recently introduced _",
    "mc _ sampling based on collective atomic moves ( wave moves )  @xcite in addition to conventional _",
    "mc _ moves .",
    "this technique was successfully introduced for _ sl _ graphene . for",
    "_ bl _ graphene it was extended as follows .",
    "wave moves are applied to both layers simultaneously , or only to the upper or lower layer , with equal probabilities for the three cases .",
    "the amplitude @xmath22 of the wave moves applied to both layers simultaneously is different from the amplitude @xmath23 of the wave moves applied to either upper or lower layer separately .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath22 and @xmath23 are chosen in such a way that the acceptance rate for wave moves is between @xmath24 and @xmath25 for any of these three cases .",
    "further @xmath19 _ mc _ steps are used to evaluate the temperature dependence of the ensemble averages .",
    "of _ sl _ ( circles , solid , blue , from ref .  ) and",
    "_ bl _ ( circles , dashed , red ) graphene , and of the interlayer distance @xmath26 of _ bl _ graphene ( diamonds , dash - dotted , green ) . at @xmath8 , @xmath27",
    "nm , @xmath28  nm , @xmath29  nm . ]    the temperature dependence of the in - plane lattice parameter @xmath30 and of the interlayer distance @xmath26 of _ bl _ graphene are shown in fig .",
    "the in - plane lattice parameter @xmath30 of _ bl _ graphene decreases with increasing temperature up to about 400  k , yielding a negative thermal expansion coefficient @xmath31 in the range 0300  k. the behavior of @xmath32 differs from that of _ sl _ graphene , which has a minimum of @xmath30 at @xmath33 and @xmath34  ( see ref .  ) in the range 0300  k , and is similar to bulk graphite , which has a minimum of @xmath30 between @xmath35 and @xmath36  k  @xcite .",
    "we note that our approach is classical and therefore not appropriate in the low temperature limit .",
    "however , since the thermal expansion is mostly determined by the low - frequency bending modes  @xcite , a classical description is already justified below room temperature .",
    "indeed for single layer graphene , our results for @xmath32 between @xmath37  k and @xmath38  k agree very well with those of ref .   where the quantum statistics of phonons was taken into account .    in ref .",
    ", the temperature dependence of @xmath30 for _ sl _ graphene and bulk graphite has been determined in the quasiharmonic approximation with phonon frequencies and gruneisen parameters calculated from first principles . while for the case of bulk graphite these calculations reproduce the non monotonic behavior of @xmath32 observed experimentally , for _ sl _ graphene @xmath32 keeps decreasing up to high temperatures . in our simulations of _ sl",
    "_ graphene  @xcite we found instead a non monotonic behavior of @xmath32 .",
    "the experimental value of @xmath32 for _ sl _ graphene that was measured up to @xmath38  k  @xcite seems to support our results .",
    "the discrepancy with quasiharmonic results should be due to the fact that this method  @xcite neglects self - anharmonic effects  @xcite , namely multiphonon contributions to the free energy .",
    "of course , in our simulations , the thermal expansion is calculated directly and _ all _ anharmonic effects are taken into account .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have results for bulk graphite with the same in - plane area , due to the long range part of our potential that , with a cut off of @xmath39  nm , requires to simulate samples with at least four layers with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the fact that the thermal expansion of _ bl _ graphene is similar to the one resulting from quasiharmonic theory for bulk graphite suggests that multiphonon processes are much less important in _",
    "graphene , compared to _",
    "sl _ graphene .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we also show the interlayer distance @xmath26 that grows with temperature , similarly to bulk graphite  @xcite , with an out - of - plane thermal expansion coefficient @xmath40 , which is comparable to the experimental value for bulk graphite , @xmath41 ( see ref .  ) .",
    "we now proceed to a study of thermal bending fluctuations . in the continuum limit graphene",
    "can be described as a flexible crystalline membrane  @xcite which is characterized by a two component in - plane phonon field @xmath42 and a one component out - of - plane displacement field @xmath43 .",
    "the effective free energy is given by the sum of bending energy and in - plane elastic energy  @xcite @xmath44 where the strain tensor @xmath45 is @xmath46 @xmath47 is the bending rigidity and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are lam coefficients .    in first approximation , _ bl _ graphene can be considered as two _ sl _ graphene layers interacting with each other .",
    "the natural way to describe _ bl _ graphene , is to use the out - of - plane deviations from the center of mass of each layer , @xmath50 and @xmath51 for upper and lower layer respectively as sketched in fig .",
    "thus , _ bl _ graphene can be parametrised by the average height fluctuation field @xmath52 and thickness fluctuation field @xmath53 .",
    "the part of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : free_f_1 ] ) related to out - of - plane displacements can thus be written as : @xmath54 where the first two terms are responsible for the bending energy of the upper and lower layers and @xmath47 is the bending rigidity per layer .",
    "we have introduced the last term characterized by the parameter @xmath55 to account for interlayer interactions . substituting @xmath50 and @xmath51 with @xmath56",
    ", we obtain : @xmath57    in the harmonic approximation , which means neglecting the last term of the strain tensor  ( [ eq : strain ] ) , the out - of - plane @xmath58 and in - plane @xmath59 modes are decoupled . in this approximation ,",
    "the mean square fourier components of the field @xmath60 with wavevectors @xmath61 are : @xmath62 and of the field @xmath63 are : @xmath64 where @xmath21 is the number of atoms per layer and @xmath65 is the area per atom in the layer .",
    "if the bending rigidity of a _ sl _ graphene is the same as the bending rigidity per layer of _ bl _ graphene , then it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_q_eq1 ] ) , that @xmath66 for _ bl _ graphene is twice smaller than for _ sl _ graphene .",
    "this is actually a very good approximation as we will show below .",
    "we further introduce the notation @xmath67 and @xmath68 .    an alternative way to describe out - of - plane fluctuations",
    "is via the unit vector normal to the average surface between two layers : @xmath69 with @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "the correlation function of the normals , @xmath71 is equal to @xmath72 if @xmath73 .",
    "thus , in the harmonic approximation @xmath74 which is a factor 2 smaller than @xmath75 in _ sl _ graphene  @xcite .",
    "the correlation functions @xmath76 and @xmath75 are calculated independently as described below . in principle to calculate @xmath76 , we have to calculate the fourier transforms of the atomic displacements @xmath77 .",
    "however , the atomic positions in a generic configuration in _ mc _ simulations are discontinuous and should be smoothed .",
    "this problem is related to the numerical calculations of derivatives and different operators on the hexagonal lattice  @xcite .",
    "our procedure is the following .",
    "let @xmath78 be the @xmath79-coordinate of an atom and @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 the @xmath79-coordinates of its three nearest neighbors .",
    "then the averaged out - of - plane displacement of the central atom @xmath83 is defined as : @xmath84    this value is used to calculate the fourier components @xmath60 using the wave vectors defined by periodic boundary conditions of the undistorted lattice .",
    "the normals needed to calculate @xmath75 , instead , are automatically smooth because they are calculated as averages of the normals to the three planes defined by three vectors , connecting the central atom to its three nearest neighbors  @xcite . for _ bl _ graphene , we calculate the correlation function @xmath75 for the normals of all atoms in the two layers .     at @xmath85 k for _ sl _ ( solid blue line ) and _ bl _ ( dashed red line )",

    "the difference between @xmath87 and @xmath88 is negligible for @xmath90  nm@xmath2 where the condition @xmath73 is satisfied .",

    "the correlation functions for _ bl _ graphene are about twice smaller than for _ sl _ graphene , which means that the effective bending rigidity for _ bl _ graphene is twice larger than the one of _ sl _ graphene , as we had guessed above . the deviation from the harmonic approximation for @xmath94  nm@xmath2 is due to the coupling between bending and stretching modes in eq .",
    "( [ eq : strain ] )  @xcite .     ( blue lines ) and thickness @xmath95 ( red lines ) fluctuations of _ bl _ graphene at @xmath85  k ( dashed lines ) and @xmath96  k ( solid lines ) .",

    "( [ eq : h_q_eq1 ] ) are pronounced .",
    "this means that thickness fluctuations are much less coupled to in - plane fluctuations , than average out - of - plane fluctuations .",
    "the second noticeable point , is the @xmath91-independent behavior of @xmath99 for @xmath100 nm@xmath2 . in turn , this means that , in this range of @xmath91 , the out - of - plane fluctuations of the two carbon layers are strongly coupled and only one soft mode @xmath101 survives . therefore , at scales larger than @xmath102  nm , _ bl _ graphene can be considered as a single membrane , whereas at smaller scales , @xmath103 and @xmath104 fluctuate rather independently .",
    "indeed it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : h_q_eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq : h_q_eq2 ] ) that if one neglects the interlayer coupling @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_q_eq2 ] ) one has : @xmath105    in general , the perfect coincidence of @xmath99 calculated from the _ mc _ simulations , with the theoretical prediction  ( [ eq : h_q_eq2 ] ) of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : free_f_5 ] ) confirms the correct choice of hamiltonian to describe _ bl _ graphene .",
    "the crossover at @xmath106 from independent to coherent fluctuations in the two layers is important for the scattering of electrons from height fluctuations in _ bl _ graphene , which is determined mainly by long range fluctuations with strongly @xmath91-dependent correlation functions ( compare with ref .   for _ sl _ graphene ) .",
    "therefore , fluctuations of the interlayer distance become irrelevant for electrons with wavevector @xmath107 .",
    "moreover , for sample sizes @xmath108  nm the height fluctuations in _ bl _ graphene are expected to be weaker than in _",
    "graphene , because in the regime of coherent fluctuations the bilayer is twice stiffer than a single layer .",
    "this is qualitatively confirmed by the results presented in fig .",

    "[ fig5 ] together with the parameter @xmath47 of _ sl _ graphene .",
    "the parameter @xmath55 of _ bl _ graphene decreases with temperature , which is not surprising .",
    "this parameter is responsible for the interlayer coupling , and it decreases with temperature since the interlayer distance @xmath26 increases with temperature ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the effective bending rigidity @xmath47 grows with temperature in agreement with the general theory of crystalline membranes  @xcite , as well as with our previous numerical results for _ sl _ graphene  @xcite .",
    "the behavior of liquid membranes is known to be opposite , with @xmath47 decreasing with temperature  @xcite .",
    "the statement that @xmath47 decreases with @xmath5 also for graphene  @xcite is therefore in disagreement with general arguments  @xcite and our results .",
    "the point is that the origin of the main anharmonic effects in liquid and crystalline membranes are completely different .",
    "for liquid membranes they originate from high order terms of the mean curvature in @xmath110 , which results in perturbative corrections to @xmath47 that are of the form @xmath111 with @xmath30 the interatomic distance  @xcite . for crystalline membranes , instead ,",
    "perturbative corrections to @xmath112 due to the coupling of bending and out - of - plane fluctuations are much stronger , positive and proportional to @xmath113 ( ref .  ) .    actually the fact that @xmath114 for crystalline membranes has a very simple meaning :",
    "as the temperature increases , the amplitude of corrugation also increases , resulting in a strengthening of the membrane  @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , the bending rigidity per layer of _ bl _ graphene turns out to be very close to that of _ sl _ graphene , which is not surprising since the interlayer coupling is much weaker than the in - plane chemical bonding .",
    "however , since the renormalization of @xmath47 is strongly @xmath91-dependent for crystalline membranes , the definition of @xmath112 should be further specified . what is shown as @xmath112 in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , and what was previously calculated for _ sl _ graphene in refs .",
    "@xcite are the results of a best fit of the correlation functions @xmath75 and @xmath76 in the @xmath91 range where the slope can be well approximated by the harmonic behavior of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : free_f_5 ] ) and  ( [ eq : g_q_eq2 ] ) . since , in this interval of @xmath91 , the out - of - plane fluctuations of either layer of _ bl _ graphene are of the same order as those of",
    "graphene ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : appr ] ) ) , it is not surprising that the temperature dependence of @xmath47 for _ bl _ graphene is only marginally smaller than for the one of _ sl _ graphene .",
    "it is important to notice , however , that the macroscopic behavior of the bending rigidity of free membranes for @xmath115 at finite temperature is divergent as @xmath116 with @xmath117 ( see refs .  ,  ) .",
    "the size of the _ bl _ graphene samples used here makes an estimate of @xmath118 for this case not precise enough as to be compared quantitatively to that found for _ sl _ graphene  @xcite , but the qualitative behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is very similar for _ sl _ and _ bl _ graphene .",
    "k. ]    the mean square height fluctuations @xmath119 are equally size - dependent . since the sum over @xmath91 is divergent at the lower limit @xmath120 , @xmath109 is mostly determined by the effective @xmath121 for the smallest wavevectors and therefore , for large enough samples , it should scale as @xmath122 ( see refs .  ,  ) . according to fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , deviations of @xmath76 from harmonic behavior occur for @xmath123 nm@xmath2 and thus , the crossover from harmonic behavior @xmath124 to the anharmonic one @xmath125 takes place for sample size @xmath126  nm .    to characterize qualitatively the anharmonicity at the atomic scale , we calculate the temperature dependence of the molar heat capacity at constant volume @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the potential energy and @xmath129 the gas constant . in fig .

    "we compare the results with those of _",
    "graphene  @xcite .",
    "three and four phonon processes result in the linear growth of @xmath130 at high temperatures  @xcite .",
    "one can see that _ sl _ and _ bl _ graphene are almost the same as expected , since phonons of the whole brillouin zone contribute to this quantity and the phonon spectra of _ sl _ and _ bl _ graphene differ only slightly close to the @xmath131 point ( see , e.g. , the calculated phonon spectra of graphene and graphite in ref .  ) .     of _ sl _ ( solid blue line ) and _ bl _ ( dashed red line ) graphene .",

    "in conclusions , we have studied several temperature dependent properties of _ bl _ graphene by means of classical _ mc _ simulations .",

    "we also introduced a new hamiltonian which accounts for interlayer interactions in _ bl _ graphene and showed that it correctly describes the behavior of _ bl _ graphene .",
    "we have found that , depending on the wavevector , the height fluctuations in the two layers are either coherent(for @xmath132 ) or incoherent ( for @xmath133 ) with @xmath134  nm@xmath2 at room temperature and we have discussed the consequences of this fact for observable properties , like height fluctuations and electron scattering .",
