    "@xcite in this context , prru@xmath1p@xmath2 deserves further attention , since the mechanism of its exotic metal - insulator ( m - i ) transition  @xcite at @xmath9  k and the ordered phase remain as mysterious puzzles , despite several studies .",

    ".    this cef level crossing could be responsible for the observed anomalies around 30 k in all measured properties .",
    "the level occupancy of the cef singlet and triplet is expected to be fluctuating at least around and above the level crossing temperature .",
    "these ( orbital ) fluctuations give rise to scattering of conduction electrons and smears the gap edge of the conduction - electron density of states ( dos ) .",

    "randomness can be arisen from impurity / vacancy or random splitting of the triplet in one of the sublattices .",
    "the present large @xmath94 is likely to be originated by the latter mechanism , since @xmath22 is very sensitive to @xmath23 only below 10 k ; in particular , @xmath94 is drastically decreased by a small field ( @xmath971 t ) .",
    "therefore , the scattering of conduction electrons from random split triplets is suppressed due to the uniform alignment of the triplet .",
    "the above arguments implicitly assumes an small exchange interaction of the form @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the exchange constant corresponding to the so - called on - site kondo coupling , @xmath100 is the conduction - electron spin , and @xmath101 is the 4@xmath7 electron spin populated at the triplet @xmath16 . formally ,",
    "if @xmath101 is random , conduction electron has to move in a random ( magnetic ) potential . on the other hand ,",
    "the potential becomes uniform when all @xmath101 align along one direction .",
    "the value of @xmath99 , accounting the hybridization between @xmath46-state of the cage ions and @xmath7-state at the center , is expected to be of the order of 1 k , since only the low - temperature ( @xmath97 10k ) resistivity is influenced by the applied magnetic fields .",
    "the absence of any magnetic order even down to 20 mk has been confirmed by the @xmath102sr measurement.@xcite thus , the obtained effect of magnetic fields , particularly gmr at low @xmath21 , observed only in pr compound , could be arisen due to the suppression of the kondo scattering of the charge carriers from the 4@xmath7-electrons .",
    "finally , under high magnetic fields the transverse magnetoresistance is anisotropic and the hall resistivity shows a broad peak , despite no anomaly and little anisotropy in the magnetization at high fields .",
    "these facts indicate a magnetic field induced change in electronic state , the detail of which would be interesting for further investigation .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the transport and magnetic properties in single - crystalline prru@xmath1p@xmath2 . the phase transition below 63 k might be due to an antiferro - hexadecapole order where a dominant @xmath6-@xmath7 hybridization plays an essential role . an additional structure has been recognized below 30 k exhibiting the anomalous behaviors , e.g. , highly temperature dependent carrier scattering , giant negative magnetoresistance , large themopower @xmath103v / k , etc . , without showing any magnetic order . judging from the resistivity behavior ,",
    "the ground state emerges as a low - carrier semimetal .",
    "these anomalous behaviors are most likely associated with the @xmath6-@xmath7 hybridization between the remaining charge carriers and pr 4@xmath7 electrons , resulting in a change in cef ground state of the pr@xmath15 sites at the cubic corner from @xmath13 to @xmath16 .",

    "<S> the low - carrier ordered phase below the metal - non - metal transition temperature @xmath0  k of prru@xmath1p@xmath2 is explored by probing magnetoresistance , magnetic susceptibility , thermoelectric power , and hall effect on high quality single crystals . </S>",
    "<S> all the measured properties exhibit the signature of decimation of the fermi surface below @xmath3 and anomalous behaviors below 30 k including a large thermoelectric power @xmath4v / k and a giant negative magnetoresistance ( 93% at @xmath5 0.4 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate an additional structure below 30 k and a semimetal - like ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the observed anomalous behaviors are most likely associated with the novel role of @xmath6-@xmath7 hybridization between conduction electrons and pr 4@xmath7 electrons , whose crystalline electric field level schemes show drastic change below @xmath3 . </S>"
