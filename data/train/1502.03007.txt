    "statistically averaged energies and corresponding heat capacities are shown in fig .  [ electr0 ] .",
    "at the zero temperature , the total internal energy reduces to the ground - state energy and the heat capacity is zero , as it should be . as it follows from eqs .   and , their avalanche growth from the @xmath69 values for the purely neumann qw takes place at the smaller temperatures as compared to the mixed bcs , which , in turn , is followed by the quantities for the dirichlet structure .",
    "this is explained by the growing difference between the two lowest energies for just consecutively mentioned bc configurations : the quantity @xmath70 at the zero field is the smallest ( largest ) for the neumann ( dirichlet ) structure : @xmath71 a remarkable feature of the heat capacity dependence is its nonmonotonic behaviour for the neumann qw : at @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) it reaches a pronounced maximum @xmath74 that is followed by the minimum of @xmath75 located at @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) . if the maximum is observed quite exactly by keeping only the first term in the parentheses of the right - hand side of eq .",
    ", the emergence and precision of the location and magnitude of the second extremum are described better by keeping more terms in the same expansion .",
    "physically , this nonmonotonicity of the heat capacity is attributed to the structure of the energy spectrum , see eqs .   and ;",
    "namely , very small temperature promotes the particle mainly to the first excited level that is only one unit above the ground state , @xmath78 , with the contribution of the other levels being negligibly small due to the almost vanishing exponents in eq .   or ,",
    "equivalently , in eqs .   and ;",
    "as a result , the heat capacity grows rapidly . for the larger temperatures , the occupations of the higher lying levels become essential",
    "; however , the transitions to them are more difficult since the difference between , e.g. , second and first excited states @xmath79 is three times larger than that between the latter and the ground level .",
    "accordingly , the same speed of the heat capacity change can not be sustained what results in the observed maximum . for the other bcs ,",
    "the ratio @xmath80 is smaller than for the neumann qw , as it follows from eq .  :",
    "@xmath81 and @xmath82 ; as a result , for them no extrema are observed on the @xmath83 dependence at @xmath84 .",
    "mathematically , the drop of the nn specific heat is caused by the interplay between the counterbalancing terms @xmath85 and @xmath86 in eq .   as the temperature grows . keeping only the first exponent in the parentheses of the right - hand side of this equation produces @xmath87 while the same procedure applied to the other bcs , see eqs .   and",
    ", results in @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which are , respectively , three and two times smaller and lie beyond the range of the validity of these expansions . accordingly , for the latter two configurations , it is essential to keep other items in the corresponding series in order for them to be correct at the decreasing @xmath34 , and these extra exponents eliminate the resonance of the first - term approximation while for the neumann qw the ( negative ) second component simply improves the previous result . note that the ho leading term of the capacity expansion from eq .   also results in @xmath90 ; however , the subsequent ( all positive ) items in the series wipe out the extremum . very broad and gentle asymmetric maximum",
    "is observed at @xmath91 for the dirichlet qw while for the mixed bc the heat capacity is a monotonically increasing function of the temperature , which , at quite large @xmath2 , rapidly approaches the asymptotic value of one half . on the contrary",
    ", the heat capacity of the symmetric qws reaches the same limit much slower , as eq .   asserts and panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ electr0 ] exemplifies .",
    "note that the ho internal energy for the high temperatures is twice of that for the hard - wall qw : @xmath92 and @xmath93 in regular units , respectively . from point of view of classical equilibrium statistics that is applicable for @xmath94 ,",
    "this difference is explained by the fact that in the former case the kinetic and potential parts of the motion make equal contributions of @xmath93 to the total energy @xcite while for the latter system it is the kinetic energy only that determines @xmath42 as the qw potential is zero . as a direct consequence of this ,",
    "the qw heat capacities in the same limit are one half of their ho counterpart",
    ".        applied electric field modifies the energy spectrum what , in turn , affects the thermodynamic properties of the wells .",
    "it was shown that the voltage increases the difference @xmath95 between the ground and first excited levels for any permutation of the bcs ( the only exception is the nd case at the small fields , see equations  ( 50 ) in @xcite ) ; accordingly , the larger temperature is needed to push out the electron from its lowest state .",
    "this is reflected in figs .",
    "[ energycanonical ] and [ heatcapacitycanonical ] where the energy @xmath96 and heat capacity @xmath97 , respectively , are shown .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath98 range where the mean energy does not change appreciably from the ground - state value gets wider for the stronger intensities @xmath0 .",
    "the same is true for the heat capacity where the plateau with its almost zero value grows with the field .",
    "the increasing voltage wipes out the nn minimum of the heat capacity simultaneously moving the maximum to the higher temperatures and increasing its magnitude . for each of the mixed bcs",
    ", it also creates a maximum that was absent at @xmath15 . mentioned above dd extremum of the heat capacity gets narrower and its peak increases with the field growing .",
    "recalling again the language of the classical statistical mechanics @xcite , one qualitatively explains the larger heat capacities at the nonzero fields by the contribution of the electric potential ; namely , the thermally averaged value of the potential energy @xmath99 is : @xmath100 this classical expression is applicable to our quantum system for the large temperatures only : @xmath101 then , the potential contribution to the heat capacity reads : @xmath102 note that , contrary to the ho , the kinetic and potential contributions to the heat capacity in this case , generally , are not equal to each other .",
    "let us also mention once again that the electric field does _ not _ affect at all the ho heat capacity , see eq .",
    ", since it simply shifts all the levels by the same amount , according to eq .  .     the same as in fig .  [ energycanonical ] but for the polarization @xmath103",

    "growing temperature leads to the decrease of @xmath104 for all electric fields ; however , thermal energy is not strong enough to make the total dipole moment negative : for any bc the polarization stays positive .",
    "to understand the statistical properties better , it is instructive to consider the case of the low temperatures . for the small voltages , as a first approximation , we also accept undisturbed by the field energies from eq .  .",
    "then , one has following dependencies :    [ polarizationlimit1 ] @xmath105    these equations were derived under the assumption of @xmath106 , but the general property stating that the first - order temperature correction is determined by @xmath107 , holds for any electric intensities . for the small fields , this difference is negative @xcite what naturally explains the decrease of the total polarization with the temperature growing . in the opposite limit of the high voltages ,",
    "the polarizations of the qw with the uniform bcs tend to the same level - independent value of one - half @xcite what requires larger temperatures in order to see the deviation of @xmath5 from its @xmath69 value .",
    "this is exemplified in fig .",
    "[ polarizationcanonical ] where the temperature - independent plateau at @xmath69 widens with the field growing .",
    "for the mixed edge requirements , this limiting quantity is supplemented by the term that is proportional to @xmath108 with its sign being determined by the orientation of the bcs @xcite ; so , for the dn case it is actually possible to observe the increase of the polarization with the temperature growing from zero .",
    "this feature is not shown in the corresponding panel of the figure since it takes place beyond the figure range @xmath109 .",
    "grand canonical distribution is used for the description of the quantum system that , in addition to the thermal balance with the external reservoir , is also in the chemical equilibrium with it .",
    "accordingly , the structure can exchange the energy as well as particles with the heat bath .",
    "so , the number of the quantum corpuscles @xmath3 in it can be changed . the fundamental role in this case",

    "the absolute value of the negative polarization at the extremum grows with the number of the particles with the largest one , at the fixed @xmath3 , being observed for the pure neumann qw followed by its nd counterpart what is a replica of the similar behaviour for the first excited level @xcite . for the temperatures below @xmath4 ,",
    "the nonzero occupation of the ground state contributes a positive term to the polarization what leads to the gradual disappearance of the negative region of the total dipole moment @xmath5 with the decreasing temperature until at @xmath69 it becomes @xmath174 , which is positive for any bc and arbitrary fields @xcite .",
    "bosonic heat capacity @xmath56 of the pure neumann qw as a function of the applied electric field @xmath68 and temperature @xmath58 for ( a ) @xmath175 , ( b ) @xmath176 and ( c ) @xmath177 .",
    "note that in the last two cases the temperature is scaled in units of the critical temperature @xmath178 while the corresponding @xmath179 axes measure specific heat per particle @xmath180 .",
    "panel ( d ) shows the chemical potential @xmath181 for @xmath177 with the corresponding heat capacity depicted in part ( c ) . ]    as a final example , fig .",
    "[ boseneumann ] exhibits evolution of the heat capacity and chemical potential with the varying electric field and temperature for the pure neumann qw .",
    "it is seen that for the small number of bosons , say , @xmath182 in panel ( a ) , the applied voltage leads , at quite warm sample , to the increase of @xmath1 while at the small @xmath2 , the width of the temperature - independent zero - capacity plateau increases with the field .",
    "these features were discussed before for the canonical ensemble . increasing the number of the particles in",
    "the well leads to the suppression of the voltage dependence , as a transition from panel ( a ) to ( b ) with @xmath183 and ( c ) for @xmath184 vividly demonstrates .",
    "no any noticeable field dependence is seen there in the range @xmath109 .",
    "it is well known that for some potentials , such as , e.g. , the 3d isotropic harmonic trap @xcite , the heat capacity has a cusp - like peculiarity as it passes through the critical temperature while for the 1d quadratic potential it is a smooth function of @xmath2 @xcite . fig .",
    "[ boseneumann ] exemplifies that no any peculiarity is observed for the 1d hard - wall potential with neumann surfaces and arbitrary applied electric fields .",
    "our calculations confirm that the same is true for any other bcs .",
    "finally , panel ( d ) shows that the chemical potential @xmath110 is a monotonically decreasing function of both the electric field @xmath0 and temperature @xmath2 .",
    "it is seen that the growing temperature diminishes the voltage influence on the chemical potential .",
    "rigorous mathematical treatment of the qw with miscellaneous bcs under the applied voltage revealed a strong influence of the interplay between them on the thermodynamic properties of the structure .",
    "in particular , without the field the differences of the energy spectrum lead , for the canonical ensemble , to the conspicuous maximum followed by the minimum of the heat capacity @xmath1 on the temperature axis for the nn quantum box while for the other edge requirements no such adjacent extrema are observed .",
    "modification of the specific heat and statistically averaged polarization in the field is qualitatively explained by the influence of the associated electrostatic potential .",
    "numerical calculations , which predicted , for the flat potential with the arbitrary bc , a salient maximum of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath2 for one fermion and its absence for the larger @xmath3 , were corroborated by the two - level model that allows simple analytical treatment with its predictions perfectly coinciding with the exact results . from this , a clear physical explanation of this phenomenon follows that is based on the analysis of the associated fermi energy . it is predicted that the applied field , in general , favors the formation of the be condensate , and the differences and similarities of this process for the different bcs are discussed .",
    "the thermally averaged dipole moment is shown to take the negative values in some ranges of the fields and temperatures .",
    "it is also argued that for the larger number of either fermions or bosons in the qw , the influence of the electric field on the thermodynamic properties diminishes .",
    "dirichlet and neumann conditions are the limiting cases of the so called robin bc @xcite @xmath185 where @xmath186 is an inward unit normal to the surface , and the parameter @xmath187 has a dimension of length and is called the extrapolation distance .",
    "its variation allows a continuous transformation from the dirichlet ( @xmath188 ) to the neumann ( @xmath189 ) situation . without the field ,",
    "especially intriguing are the properties of the qw at the small negative robin lengths , @xmath190 , when , in addition to the positive spectrum , two almost degenerate odd and even levels with the energies @xmath191 are created @xcite .",
    "analysis of the robin qw in the electric field might present an interesting extension of the present research .",
