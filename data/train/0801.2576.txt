    "the decay of an excited atomic state is manifestly affected by its environment .",
    "this has been evident since studies began on the effect of cavities and conducting plates on spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions of nearby surfaces affect the electromagnetic mode density and , in the simplest treatment , the application of fermi s golden rule shows that the spontaneous emission rate is modified .",
    "however , with the development of high - q cavities in the microwave @xcite and optical regime @xcite it was possible to have an oscillatory exchange of energy between a single atom and a single cavity mode of electromagnetic ( em ) radiation .",
    "in this regime a single quantum of em energy may be involved and the atom may become entangled with the cavity . it is often desirable to control quantum systems of this kind , for example , to try and make a specific state of the cavity field ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , or to make entanglement , or in more complex systems , to make photons on demand @xcite .",
    "however , the effect of the environment is always there as decoherence , or dissipation , and it almost always acts to degrade the quantum phenomena in which we are interested .    in this paper",
    "we will look at a model example of what we might do in the environment to try and regain control .",
    "we will take the simplest quantum optical system of a two - level atom coupled to a leaky cavity . in our idealised system",
    "the cavity leaks through lossless dielectric mirrors , although there well may be other systems that fit the model such as coupled microwave cavities @xcite or engineered reservoirs for ion traps @xcite . for the optical cavity system",
    ", there are a number of well established types of quantum optical environment .",
    "for example , the thermal bath contains energy which ultimately leads to thermalisation of the atom and cavity .",
    "rigged reservoirs @xcite have bath states with coherence which add gain and noise to the field state .",
    "the broad - band squeezed vacuum @xcite has correlations between different frequency bath states which in general has both the properties of a thermal bath and the presence of coherence .",
    "all of these environments would eventually excite an initially unexcited atom in the cavity .",
    "the environment we will look at is one in which the bath , or reservoir modes , change their frequency as a function of time .",
    "this kind of environment would not excite an initially unexcited atom , although the dynamics of an initially excited atom would be affected .",
    "in general , we would expect that reservoir modes do have time - dependent properties , since they are themselves embedded in an uncontrolled environment .",
    "however , here we will suppose that we can at least control their frequency for a short period of time .",
    "the reservoir will be fully specified if the frequency and the strength of the coupling to the atom are known for each mode : this amounts to specifying the reservoir mode structure .",
    "if we modulate all the reservoir mode frequencies by the same amount , keeping the coupling of each mode to the atom the same , the overall effect is the same as moving one of the cavity mirrors , which has been studied for the case of an oscillating mirror @xcite .",
    "however , this case is also equivalent to a time - dependent detuning of the reservoir from the atomic transition frequency .",
    "this situation has been discussed in ref.@xcite where it was found that it was possible to inhibit the decay of the atom for particular modulation frequencies .",
    "modulation of the phase of the atom - cavity coupling constant was also analysed by agarwal @xcite who showed that , for a low - q cavity situation , the decoherence could be reduced with fast modulation .",
    "temporal variation of both the phase and weight of the coupling strengths between an atom and a continuum , with variation of the atomic detuning was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "the bath modes had to be modulated identically and the time - dependence had to be a weak perturbation . however , it was shown that both enhancement and suppression of the decay rate relative to the golden rule limit is possible .    in this paper",
    "we aim to investigate a new and subtle case , where the mode frequencies and coupling constants are manipulated , but in such a way as to leave all macroscopic properties of the reservoir unaffected .",
    "the unaffected properties will be the overall spectral width and resonance frequency of the reservoir structure . to achieve this the bath modes both increase their frequency and change their coupling strength as shown in figure [ modesfig ] .",
    "passing through the cavity resonance from below , the coupling strength of a mode to the atom first rises and then falls as the frequency is increased .",
    "the physical realisation could be a double cavity : one cavity couples to an atom and leaks to a second cavity which can have its end wall moved .",
    "we will discuss this realisation further in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "( see equation [ hamiltonian ] ) at two different times @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the envelope of the couplings remains the same as the reservoir mode frequencies vary in time .",
    "thus the coupling of the atom to an individual mode changes in time .",
    "the thick line indicates the same mode @xmath2 at two different times , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . since at time @xmath4",
    ", this mode has moved to a different frequency under the static envelope , the coupling has changed accordingly . ]    without further analysis this situation would present us with a dilemma .",
    "the macroscopic structure of the atom - reservoir interaction is unchanged in time , but the individual bath modes only interact with the atom for a finite time",
    ". it may not be immediately clear that this situation can dramatically affect the atomic decay : at any point in time the atom has the same coupling to some bath modes .",
    "however , because the bath modes change , the history of the atom - bath interaction affects the time development of their population . we will find that in this case both enhanced and inhibited decay are possible .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we describe our model for the problem and derive the equations governing the dynamics of the atomic state populations .",
    "section [ static_reservoir ] reviews the standard problem of a two - level atom interacting with a high - q cavity in the strong and weak coupling regimes .",
    "however , the section pays particular attention to the evolution of the quantum state of the reservoir degrees of freedom , which are often traced over in similar calculations .",
    "section [ results ] summarises the main results of the investigation in the regimes of strong and weak coupling .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] , we estimate the size of the effects that might be observed and summarise the findings of the paper .",
    "we consider a two - level atom , with states denoted @xmath5 and @xmath6 , coupled to a reservoir of electromagnetic radiation modes at zero temperature .",
    "the reservoir modes , labelled by an index @xmath2 , have _ time - dependent _ frequencies @xmath7 , and raising and lowering operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the evolution of the composite atom and reservoir system is given in the rotating wave approximation by ( @xmath10 ) @xmath11 where the atomic transition frequency is @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the atomic raising and lowering operators respectively .",
    "the electric dipole coupling of the @xmath15 mode of the electromagnetic radiation field to the atomic transition @xmath16 is denoted by @xmath17 . without loss of generality ,",
    "the @xmath17 are chosen to be real .",
    "for simplicity , we will later choose the spectral profile of the coupling constants to be peaked at the frequency of the atomic transition .",
    "while the reservoir modes are re - distributed , we will suppose that this envelope remains fixed .",
    "therefore , the magnitude of the coupling constants @xmath17 must vary in time to ensure this ( see figure [ modesfig ] ) .",
    "we will also assume that whilst the frequency change of the reservoir modes may be very rapid from the point of view of the atom , it will not be so fast that it could create photons in the cavity by itself . in this sense",
    "the cavity field will adiabatically follow the motion of its end - mirror ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) .    to develop equations for the state vector we work in an interaction picture and",
    "so we may write the time - evolution operator as @xmath18 the effect of the atom - reservoir interaction is contained in the term @xmath19 , which satisfies the schrdinger equation @xmath20 and the interaction picture hamiltonian @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 d\\tau\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\   &   + g_k(t)\\hat{\\sigma}^{+}\\hat{b}_{k}\\exp\\left(-i\\int_{0}^{t}\\big[\\omega_k(\\tau ' ) - \\omega_{0}\\big]d\\tau'\\right)\\bigg ] . \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{h_int}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the state vector is expanded in terms of the eigenstates of the excitation number operator , @xmath23 .",
    "since @xmath24 commutes with the hamiltonian ( [ h_int ] ) , the number of quanta is a constant of the motion . for initial states we assume",
    "the system is prepared with the atom in its excited state , and the reservoir is initially empty , i.e.@xmath25 .",
    "then the state vector at time @xmath26 may be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the amplitude for the atom to be found in its excited state , and @xmath29 is the amplitude for the @xmath15 mode of the reservoir to contain one excitation .",
    "elimination of @xmath21 and @xmath30 from equations ( [ ui_def ] ) , ( [ h_int ] ) and ( [ state_vector ] ) leads to the following coupled differential equations for the amplitudes @xmath31 and @xmath29 : @xmath32d\\tau\\right)c_{k}(t ) \\label{chirp_dynamics1 } \\\\",

    "later , we will also examine an idealised time - dependent bath spectrum , which is in fact just the frequency dependent population of the reservoir modes .",
    "we define this spectrum by considering those modes @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) which have frequencies that lie within @xmath47 of a given frequency @xmath37 at a time @xmath26 .",

    "( this would be @xmath145 in the case of strong - coupling and no chirp . ) with such high chirp , resonant modes which start to become occupied are moved far from resonance before they can act back on the atom , and are replaced by empty ones . in this way , the atom effectively sees an empty reservoir and obeys markovian dynamics .",
    "a solution for the behaviour of @xmath28 follows trivially : @xmath146 figure [ decayratefig ] shows the agreement between this approximate analytic result and a numerical simulation which used a bath of discrete field modes and did not make the markov approximation .",
    "in fact , the result ( [ markovian_decay ] ) also holds in the weak - coupling regime , independent of the rate @xmath109 , as discussed in sections [ results_weak ] and [ conclusions ] . for this reason as @xmath147 the static reservoir result @xmath148 , equation ( [ markov_const ] )",
    "is recovered . however , in the strong coupling case , this limit can not be attained with equation ( [ eq : def_xi ] ) , since , eventually , the constraint @xmath143 is violated .",
    "in addition , we know that for @xmath68 we should find the static decay result @xmath53 implied by equation ( [ exact_ca_static ] ) . nevertheless , since @xmath149 in the strong coupling regime , it is straightforward to have an _ enhanced _ decay rate ( i.e.  @xmath150 ) if @xmath116 is greater than unity , but not too high . in figure [ decayratefig ]",
    "we can find this for the low chirp part of the @xmath151 curve ( @xmath152 ) , since only then is @xmath153 ( with @xmath143 ) ; for the rest of the curve the decay is _ inhibited _ relative to @xmath68 .",
    "however , if @xmath154 is even modestly increased the region of enhanced decay is increased substantially .",
    "it is interesting to note the equation ( [ final_gamma_infinity ] ) can be re - written as @xmath155 ,      \\label{eq : gam_inf_rewrite}\\ ] ] where @xmath156 . in this expression",
    "the inequality @xmath157 holds , with equality as @xmath158 ( i.e.@xmath109 ) tends to zero .",
    "since the factor @xmath115 is always greater than unity for strong coupling , we may have either _ enhanced _ or _ inhibited _ markovian decay , depending on the value of @xmath109 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : gam_inf_rewrite ] ) can also be used to motivate the constraint @xmath143 introduced above .",
    "since the time - scale @xmath159 for atomic dynamics is now @xmath160 , and the factor @xmath161 is always less than ( or equal to ) unity , it follows that @xmath162 . since the time - width of the kernel is approximately @xmath163",
    ", the system will be markovian if @xmath164 .",
    "since @xmath165 for @xmath166 , this will always be true if @xmath167 .",
    "for very large chirp , compared to @xmath168 , we can expand the bessel functions in equation ( [ final_gamma_infinity ] ) to obtain the approximate result @xmath169^{2 }    ,    \\label{eq : gamma_limit}\\ ] ] which slowly decreases as @xmath170 is increased .     on the chirp - rate @xmath109 .",
    "the dashed lines show the prediction of equation ( [ final_gamma_infinity ] ) , whereas the crosses show the decay rates extracted from numerical solution ( without making the markov approximation ) by fitting an exponential decay to the data .",
    "the parameters used for the three curves were @xmath171 , and @xmath172 .",
    "note that the fit is only expected to be good for @xmath124 , since for smaller chirp - rates than this , the behaviour of @xmath91 is not necessarily an exponential decay and may even be oscillatory .",
    "thus for the highest two values of @xmath56 the position of @xmath173 is marked .",
    "the chirp @xmath109 enhances the decay when @xmath174 . ]      as already discussed in section [ static_reservoir_strong ] , in the static case the excitation of the reservoir modes moves outwards from @xmath12 over several rabi cycles towards final peaks at @xmath90 .",
    "now in the intermediate - chirp case , the frequency of the modes is increased by approximately the same amount over one rabi - cycle .",
    "that is , the occupied modes are brought back into resonance with the atom on every rabi - cycle .",
    "this can have a profound effect on the dynamics of the atomic excited state probability , @xmath92 , since occupied modes with angular frequency in the vicinity of @xmath12 have the strongest interaction with the atom , as can be seen from equation ( [ chirp_dynamics1 ] ) .    in this regime of intermediate chirp rate ( @xmath175 ) and strong coupling ( @xmath73 ) , we must rely on numerical results . as illustrated in figure",
    "[ landscape_fig ] , two free parameters , i.e.  @xmath115 and the rate of redistribution of reservoir mode frequencies , label the dynamics of the system . a numerical search was conducted over this plane , and it was found that rabi oscillations were inhibited over most of this region .",
    "the explanation for this is that occupied modes of the reservoir are moved from resonance before they have a chance to re - populate the atom .",
    "a typical example is shown in figure [ enhanced_decay ] .",
    "additionally , for @xmath176 , there is a particular chirp - rate for which a ` recycling condition ' is fulfilled and the vacuum rabi - splitting in the reservoir does nt occur .",
    "a significant population may become trapped in a cycle of resonant exchange between atom and reservoir , and rabi oscillations may persist for much _ longer _ than in the static case .",
    "the atomic behaviour is shown in figure [ testfig ] .",
    "we also note that the oscillation frequency increases with increasing chirp - rate as is seen empirically from simulations . in figure",
    "[ fig : chirp_bath_spectrum ] we see the corresponding spectrum of excitation in the reservoir for two pairs of times . in each case",
    "the structured peak at higher frequencies is sufficiently detuned for this reservoir population to be effectively decoupled from the atomic dynamics .",
    "therefore , excitation simply moves to higher frequencies at later times , as may be seen by comparing the spectra after @xmath177 and @xmath178 rabi cycles .",
    "this non - interacting peak has an area of approximately a half , which represents the population that was ` pushed ' to frequencies above @xmath12 during the rabi splitting at early times .",
    "we see that the left hand peak , which is centred at the atomic transition , remains on resonance as individual mode frequencies pass through this region .",
    "it does invert periodically during the time evolution , but this population exchange , or recycling , between the atom and _ locally resonant _",
    "reservoir modes is very stable .",
    "for example , we can see that at the same part of the cycle the shape of this peak is relatively unchanged between ( a ) and ( c ) [ and between ( b ) and ( d ) ] in figure [ fig : chirp_bath_spectrum ] .",
    "this behaviour is quite different to that seen for the static reservoir in figure [ intermediate_chirp_fig ] .     caused by manipulation of the reservoir modes to which the atom is coupled ( by a linear chirp ) .",

    "the weak chirp will be expected to perturb the dynamics only slightly . in the example shown in figure [ high_q_low_chirp_fig ]",
    "the difference between the chirped and unchirped dynamics is very small , although it may be noticed the the chirped bath results in a slightly raised rabi frequency . this frequency shift might be observable if the decay rate is low enough that a large phase shift accumulates in the rabi oscillations . to evaluate the size of this effect",

    "this represents the damped oscillations of equation ( [ exact_ca_static ] ) .",
    "if we now admit a finite value of @xmath109 , we seek the perturbed locations of the poles in the approximate form @xmath199 the factor @xmath200 is found by substitution into the equation @xmath201 . since the modification of the decay rate is small , and not of interest , we examine the imaginary part of @xmath200 to find that im@xmath202 and then the new rabi frequency @xmath203 is approximately @xmath204 in the above we also used the strong coupling approximation @xmath205 . even if the correction to the rabi frequency is small , the effect may be noticeable since there will be an accumulated phase shift over time .",
    "since the largest usable time in this limit is of order @xmath206 , it follows that the largest phase difference is approximately given by @xmath207 thus even if the first term in brackets is small , since it is the correction to the rabi frequency in equation ( [ eq : ltnewomega ] ) , the strong coupling regime ensures the second term is large and so the resulting phase difference may be of a reasonable size .",
    "note that the effect will be made more visible , not only by increasing the chirp @xmath109 , but also by _ reducing _ the strong atom - cavity coupling .    ,",

    "this remains true , irrespective of how the reservoir mode frequencies are manipulated .",
    "therefore , for weakly - coupled reservoirs , the analysis of section [ results_strong_high ] , culminating in equation ( [ markovian_decay ] ) , is valid for all chirp - rates .",
    "the region of weak coupling corresponds to the horizontal strip at the bottom of figure [ landscape_fig ] .",

    "[ observable_effects ]    we have investigated the effects on the dynamics of an open quantum system of a particular manipulation of the reservoir mode frequencies .",
    "while other authors have discussed reservoirs with time - dependent properties , we have here considered the subtle case where all _ macroscopic _ properties of the reservoir remain _ static _ , while the microscopic structure of the reservoir changes .",
    "this problem is intriguing , since the effects are non - trivial , and can not easily be guessed in advance .",
    "it is tempting to think that since the only difference with the usual , static case is a redistribution of reservoir mode _ populations _ , only non - markovian systems would be affected .",
    "this is not the case , however , and an effect can be seen for both markovian and non - markovian systems .",
    "we have characterised the nature of the dynamics in three different regions of parameter space ( see figure [ landscape_fig ] ) and found conditions for each type of behaviour in section [ results ] .",
    "it is shown that manipulation of the reservoir mode frequencies may alter the _ nature _ of the dynamics ( from non - markovian to markovian behaviour ) when the chirp - rate is high ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "analytical results are presented for the decay in this case ( equations ( [ final_gamma_infinity ] ) and ( [ markovian_decay ] ) ) .",
    "the resulting decay may be enhanced or inhibited , compared to the un - chirped case . in the case of strong coupling and low chirp",
    ", the chirp manifests itself as a frequency shift in the rabi oscillations ( equation ( [ eq : ltnewomega ] ) ) .    in order to realise the effects of section [ results ] in the context of optical cavity qed",
    "it would be necessary to construct a high - q cavity and a reservoir whose mode frequencies could be manipulated as described above , i.e.  without altering the envelope of the coupling constants near the atomic resonance .",
    "ideally , if the resonant frequency of the cavity is to remain unchanged ( at @xmath213 ) , its cavity mirrors must be fixed , too .",
    "since there will be losses through the cavity mirrors , i.e.  a coupling to the external environment , the bath mode frequencies may be altered by changing the properties of that external environment .",
    "this would be sufficient to isolate the basic effect from , for example , changing the position of the cavity resonance ( as in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the most simple way of doing this would be to have an inner and outer cavity , with lengths @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "we can suppose that the outer mirror can be moved by a piezoelectric actuator , or similar device , which will change the length @xmath215 .",
    "then for small fractional changes in the outer cavity length we can write @xmath216 so that @xmath217 to illustrate the potential size of any observable effects , we consider some specific cases .",
    "first we take an optical atomic transition with angular frequency and a 40 @xmath218 m inner cavity for which and @xcite .",
    "this is in the strong coupling regime . for the outer cavity",
    "we let @xmath219 1 cm , and we assume here that the inner cavity is diffractively coupled to the outer cavity to enhance the mode density , whilst maintaining a strong directional property .",
    "if we can move the out - most mirror at a speed of 0.1 ms@xmath220 for the short time necessary , we find that .",
    "then @xmath221 , which is enough to enter the intermediate chirp region indicated in figure [ landscape_fig ] and discussed in section [ results_strong_intermediate ] .",
    "if we would increase the mirror speed to 0.65 ms@xmath220 , @xmath116 increases to approximately ten , which places us in the high chirp , strong coupling regime of figure [ landscape_fig ] . in this case equation",
    "( [ final_gamma_infinity ] ) applies and we obtain an enhancement of decay : @xmath222 .",
    "this enhanced decay can be increased even further if , for example , the cavity decay rate is reduced by a factor of ten : in that case @xmath223 . as an example of inhibited decay we can simply reduce @xmath56 so that @xmath96 . in this case",
    "we are in the weak coupling regime and the inhibition of decay relative to the static reservoir case is independent of @xmath56 and given by a factor of approximately @xmath224 when @xmath225 mhz and the speed is 0.65 ms@xmath220 , as above .    we have seen that many of the effects described here could be tested with currently available experimental parameters . for an atom weakly coupled to a high - q cavity , the inhibition of decay and decoherence is considerable , with the possibility of suppressing the decay rate by a factor of @xmath226 . in the case of strong coupling , atomic decay can be inhibited ( for high chirp @xmath109 ) or enhanced .",

    "this factor can be increased if the ratio @xmath115 is increased along with the smallest cavity chirp consistent with @xmath143 .",
    "an attractive feature of this model is that the suppression , or enhancement , could be turned on and off at will by moving or not moving the mirror of an _",
