    "in the standard model ( sm ) , it has been observed since long ago @xcite that the requirement of vacuum stability up to the unification scale and beyond , and the absence of a landau pole under the renormalization group ( rg ) evolution , constrain the value of the higgs mass @xmath5 and the size of the yukawa couplings of the heavy fermions @xcite .",
    "lower and upper bounds on @xmath6 have been derived and shown to depend more or less significantly on the size of @xmath7 , the yukawa of the top quark , which can drive the quartic higgs coupling to become negative beyond a certain scale . this situation can be ameliorated with the addition of extra scalars , either in the form of sm singlets , in some cases even taking the role of dark matter components @xcite , or by a modification of the scalar potential .",
    "crucial in this type of analysis is the sign and the size of the various contributions to the @xmath8 function of the quartic higgs coupling @xmath9 , which is negative for fermions and positive for scalars . at the same time , the size of the same coupling at the electroweak scale @xmath10 , i.e. at the starting scale of the evolution , turns out to be of extreme importance in driving @xmath11 either towards a non - perturbative region or to render the higgs potential unstable in the far ultraviolet .    in this work",
    "we are going to investigate the constraints imposed by the condition of vacuum stability in a rather minimal extension of the sm enlarged by an extra @xmath0 symmetry and one extra higgs scalar .",
    "this is a sm singlet which triggers the spontaneous breaking of the extra abelian symmetry with a vev @xmath12 assumed to lay around the tev scale .",

    "in particular , we are going to examine how these constraints are modified by the inclusion of three right handed neutrinos , taken to be sm singlets .",

    "we will see that the requirement of vacuum stability under the evolution sets significant constraints on the mass of the right handed neutrinos .",

    "the mixing in the scalar sector modifies the light scalar couplings to fermions and bosons with respect to the sm higgs by a factor @xmath90 .",

    "this situation is typical of models with a type - i seesaw , and it is not shared by other cases , for instance by models with an inverse - seesaw mechanism where neither @xmath13 nor @xmath52 are constrained to small values . regarding the heavy neutrinos , for the sake of simplicity , we assume their masses degenerate in flavour space , @xmath94 .",
    "this assumption simplifies the structure of the yukawa coupling @xmath52 which becomes proportional to the unit matrix .",

    "the stability regions of the potential are found to cover an interval characterized by small values of the mixing angle @xmath16 .",
    "interestingly , the interval overlaps with the one predicted by the bound given in eq .",
    "( [ stubound ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the smallness of the mixing between the two scalars can be inferred also from rg stability arguments , beside the indications coming from electroweak precision data .",
    "such values of the mass of the heavy higgs are necessary in order to achieve vacuum stability up to the gut scale . from fig .",
    "[ fig.typeimh2th ] it is also evident that the three charge assignments considered here do not provide very different results .",
    "indeed , the shape of the allowed regions remain qualitatively the same .",
    "the only major difference between the three sm extensions analyzed here is in the @xmath45 model , in which the stability regions up to @xmath74 and @xmath75 appear to be enlarged , with respect to the other two cases , and select smaller values of the mixing angle @xmath16 .",
    "this behaviour shows that the effects of the charge assignments , which are in general quite small , can nevertheless influence the vacuum stability in specific regions of the parameter space .    in fig .",
    "[ fig.typeimh2mnu ] we investigate the stability regions in the @xmath99 parameter space .",
    "stability of the potential along the rg evolution reaches the planck scale even for a heavy neutrino up to @xmath100 , for @xmath101 .",
    "we observe that the heavy neutrino mass does not influence the upper bound on the heavy scalar mass , which essentially originates for the choice of @xmath12 and @xmath16 , as one can deduce from fig .",
    "[ fig.typeimh2th ] .",
    "as we raise the masses of the heavy neutrinos , the effect of @xmath52 quickly overcome all the other contributions in the running of @xmath57 , driving it towards negative values and , therefore , compromising the stability of the scalar sector .",
    "this behaviour is due to the large and negative @xmath56 term in the @xmath3 function of @xmath57 and can be exploited to extract upper bounds on the heavy neutrino masses . fig .",
    "[ fig.typeil2](a ) illustrates the evolution of @xmath57 in the @xmath15 extension for different values of the heavy neutrino mass , namely @xmath102 , which correspond , respectively , to @xmath103 .",
    "this clearly shows that the @xmath57 quartic coupling quickly turns to negative values as the neutrino mass increases .",
    "indeed , a @xmath104 , with @xmath105 , easily violates the vacuum stability requirement below the scale . + it is then interesting to study the behaviour of the maximum scale , up to which the stability is maintained , as a function of @xmath52 or , equivalently , of @xmath106 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.typeil2](b ) for different values of the heavy higgs mass",
    ". one can deduce that the heavy neutrino mass can not be larger than @xmath107 in order to achieve the stability up to the gut or planck scales .",
    "notice that there are no significant changes on the limiting value of @xmath106 between the two scales , due to the presence of an asymptote in the three curves , which shows a boundless stability .",
    "one can easily observe that the allowed region for @xmath106 increases for a bigger @xmath17 .",
    "indeed , a heavier @xmath108 implies larger values for the quartic couplings at the electroweak scale , which compensate , at least in the range @xmath107 , the decreasing effect of a bigger @xmath106 .",
    "we conclude our analysis with some comments on the implications for the stability of the potential under a change in the vev of the extra sm singlet scalar @xmath27 , @xmath12 . in fig .",
    "[ fig.typeimh2vev ] ( a ) we have depicted the regions in the @xmath95 space in which stability is achieved up to the planck scale for three different values of the @xmath12 vacuum expectation value .",
    "it is interesting to observed that a bigger @xmath12 only affects the small @xmath16 region , extending the maximum allowed values of the heavy scalar mass . on the other hand , as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig.typeimh2vev](b ) , the stability bounds on the heavy neutrino masses trivially scale with @xmath12 .",
    "indeed black curves correspond to @xmath109 while the blue ones are obtained for @xmath110 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the rg equations depend explicitly on the dimensionless @xmath52 and @xmath111 .",
    "+ if @xmath12 is pushed well above the tev scale , the sm particles would decouple from the new degrees of freedom introduced by the addition of the extra abelian gauge group and of the heavy scalar field .",
    "in such a case the evolution of the parameters of the scalar sector are controlled by the sm particle content alone only up to the @xmath15 spontaneous symmetry breaking scale . only at this scale",
    "the complete model should be taken into account , and the evolution would be driven by the @xmath3 functions presented in eq.([betafuncs ] ) . in this case , as pointed out in @xcite , the tree - level threshold corrections in the scalar sector have to be included and this would help in stabilizing the scalar potential . on the other hand , as @xmath12 reaches higher scales , it would be possible to reproduce the small neutrino masses even with @xmath112 . in this situation , the larger values of the yukawa s of the light neutrinos would effect the rg evolution and should be taken into account .",
    "the analysis of this scenario is beyond the scope of the present paper and it will be discussed in a separate work .",
    "we have presented results of a numerical study of the rg equations for a generic @xmath0 extension of the sm with the inclusion of one extra complex scalar and three heavy right handed neutrinos .",
    "we have conisdered a type - i seesaw mechanism for the generation of the small masses of the three light sm neutrinos .",
    "the @xmath0 charges have been determined by requiring the cancellation of the gauge and gravitational anomalies .",
    "our work has been based on a re - analysis of the evolution , which is drastically affected by the coefficient of the yukawa s of the right handed neutrinos . as we have pointed out in the introduction , a crucial change in the rg equation for the coefficient of the quartic coupling @xmath57",
    "makes such a coupling negative even at the tev scale , destabilizing the potential .",
    "we have discussed , in the 2-parameter class of solutions that we have investigated , three specific charge assignments , corresponding to @xmath1 and @xmath2 , showing that their rg evolutions share similar behaviour .",
    "we have also focused our interest on a specific scenario in which the vev of the extra higgs is in the tev scale , which could be studied at the lhc .",
    "we have shown that within this scenario , for a heavy higgs in the tev range and a right handed neutrino of mass between 100 and 1000 gev , all the constraints coming from the vacuum stability of the scalar potential are satisfied .",
    "for this reason , larger mass values of the right handed neutrino do not allow to extend the validity of these models up to the planck scale .",
