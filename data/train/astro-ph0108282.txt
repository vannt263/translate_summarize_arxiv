    "the local group ( lg ) consists of two dominant giant spirals and a system of satellites . due to the small distances",
    "this sample of well studied dwarf galaxies provides unique insight into the structure and evolution of low - luminosity systems and their tidal interaction with the parent galaxy .",
    "furthermore their distribution and dynamics gives an excellent opportunity to probe the general paradigm of galaxy formation on galactic scales ( see klypin @xmath1 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "the lg satellites are part of a large zoo of dwarf galaxies which by number are the dominant population in the universe ( e.g. ferguson and binggeli 1994 ) . like in other dwarf galaxies",
    ", well - defined correlations have been found between their measured properties , like absolute magnitude , surface brightness , characteristic radius and metallicity ( armandroff @xmath1 1998 ; caldwell 1999 ) .",
    "their low surface brightnesses and metallicities which correlate well with luminosity have been interpreted as a result of substantial gas loss in the early stages of evolution ( larson 1974 ; vader 1986 ; arimoto and yoshii 1987 , dekel and silk 1986 ) . in this case",
    "one might expect that star formation stopped in dwarf galaxies after a short initial period due to the removal of the gas in a wind .",
    "this is however not confirmed by recent observations . as summarized e.g. by da costa ( 1998 ) and grebel ( 2000 )",
    "( see also da costa @xmath1 2000 for recent observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies around m31 ) the stellar populations of the lg satellites show a fascinating diversity of star formation histories .",
    "several systems are old . there",
    "exist however also systems with intermediate or young stellar populations and those which experienced several distinct epochs of efficient star formation with long periods of quiescence .",
    "as pointed out e.g. by van den bergh ( 1994 ) the fraction of intermediate - age population stars correlates with galactocentric distance , indicating that satellite galaxies do not evolve in isolation but are affected by interaction with their parent galaxy .",
    "especially the smallest galactic systems , the dwarf spheroidals ( dsph ) have very large mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath0 ) which appear to anticorrelate with their intrinsic brightness , indicating the presence of a dark matter component with a constant mass and a variable luminosity ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "this result is very interesting as it might provide important information on the dark substructure of galaxies and maybe even on the nature of dark matter ( e.g. burkert 2000 ) .",
    "an alternative scenario is however that the dsphs with large apparent velocity dispersions are simply coherent but unbound groups of stars on similar orbits ( kuhn 1993 , kroupa 1997 , klessen and kroupa 1998 ) . in this case",
    ", these systems might not contain large amounts of dark matter ( moore 1996 , burkert 1997 ) .",
    "this result would be interesting as it indicates that the satellites do not represent the typical subunits out of which their parent galaxies formed but rather formed during the merging of an lmc - type galaxy which broke into pieces as a result of its tidal interaction with the local group .",
    "this letter combines recent detailed observations of the local group satellite galaxies and presents a puzzling new correlation between their metallicity and their mass - to - light ratio .",
    "we argue that this correlation could be understood if these systems experienced efficient loss of metals during the star formation phase with a final episode of gas loss at the end of the star formation epoch .",
    "it also indicates that dwarf spheroidals are gravitationally bound and contain a large amount of dark matter .",
    "in total there are 28 dwarf galaxies within a volume of radius 570 kpc ( @xmath3 kpc assuming a hubble constant @xmath4 , @xmath5 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 ) centered on the milky way and m31 .",
    "they have v - band absolute magnitudes between @xmath7 and can be divided into few different morphological types : dsph , dwarf ellipticals ( de ) , gas rich spirals and irregulars ( s , irr , dirr ) and transition dwarfs ( dsph / dirr ) ( see grebel 2000,2001 ) .",
    "the median distance of the lg satellites to the central galaxy is @xmath8 kpc with the dsph being concentrated around the two giant spirals .",
    "values and errors for the mean metallicity ( @xmath9fe / h@xmath10 $ ] ) of the dominant intermediate / old population , the v - band central surface brightness ( @xmath11 ) and the v - band total luminosity ( @xmath12 ) were taken from the most recent compilations by grebel ( 2000 ) and van den bergh ( 2000 ) .",
    "data for the mass are collected from mateo ( 1998 ) for most of the satellites and from van den bergh ( 2000 ) for the lmc , smc , sculptor and lgs3 .",
    "the @xmath13 for andii was found in ct et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .    in figure 1",
    ", we show the relation between the v - band mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath13 , here @xmath14 refers to the dynamical mass , see mateo 1998 ) and the mean metallicity for our sample of local group satellites .",
    "the errors for @xmath9fe / h@xmath10 $ ] indicate the intrinsic spread of metallicity for each galaxy ( see grebel 2000 ) .",
    "an error of @xmath15 in the determination of @xmath16 for our satellites ( see mateo 1998 ) was adopted .",
    "the @xmath13 - metallicity relation is well described by a linear law of slope unity ( solid line in figure 1 )    @xmath17\\ ] ]    with a chi - square error ( @xmath18 ) of 1.4 , i.e. satellites with high @xmath13 have low metallicities .",
    "this relation is independent of distance to the central galaxy and morphological type among other global parameters as their star formation history .",
    "we also display in figure 1 the @xmath13 ratio versus the v - band central surface brightness for the same galaxies ( except m32 due to its very bright nucleus and phoenix and pegasus for which no @xmath11 values were found in the literature ) .",
    "the solid line is a linear fit to the data with slope @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( see also armandroff et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the scatter in the m / l - metallicity relation improves when we include as a second parameter the central surface brightness .",
    "a principal component analysis shows that @xmath21 of the variance of the data are in a line . a least - squares fit yields the following log - linear regression with a @xmath22 :    @xmath23 + 0.13 \\ , \\sigma_{0,v } -2.86\\ ] ]    this relation can be understood as a fundamental line for the satellites of the local group ( see figure 2 ) where the values for the central surface brightness and metallicity of a given system determine its @xmath0 ratio .",
    "hence metal poor and low surface brightness ( lsb ) dwarfs are dark matter dominated systems while high surface brightness ( hsb ) metal rich dwarfs will have a low @xmath0 ratio .",
    "in addition , for a given surface brightness , systems with low metallicities have large mass - to - light ratios . besides m32 which is peculiar in many respects",
    "we did not find any system located outside this relation , even if we include the data for those few dwarfs outside our volume and located in the outer fringes of the local group ( see van den bergh 2000 ) .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that all local group satellites follow a fundamental line that combines the mass - to - light ratios with their metallicity and central surface brightness .",
    "we therefore conclude that dsphs , like the other lg galaxies are unlikely to be chance projections of disrupted galaxies but instead are strongly dark matter confined .",
    "if they actually were tidal streams seen in projection it would be difficult to understand why the projected velocity dispersion which depends on the orbit and the projection angle should follow the sample tight relationship as the other galaxies of the lg .",
    "in fact we can now formulate a more general question : do there exist yet undetected high - surface brightness metal poor dwarfs with high m / l ratios or low - surface brightness metal rich dwarfs with low m / l ratios ?",
    "these systems would not follow the fundamental line relation and might have formed by a different physical process than tyical satellites .",
    "the globular clusters ( gc ) around m31 and the milky way are systems without dark matter ( @xmath24 ) , unlike galaxies , with a large range in metallicities from metal poor to metal rich clusters . they therefore lie outside of the fundamental line of satellites .",
    "there are however also a few cases of gc that follow our @xmath13 - [ fe / h ] relation .",
    "mayall ii ( g1 ) in m31 and pal 13 in the milky way have anomalous @xmath16 ratios ( 7.5 and 20 respectively ) with a spread in metallicity ( @xmath25$]=-0.98@xmath260.45 and -1.67@xmath260.20 respectively ) compared to the majority of globular clusters which are single - population systems without such a spread ( see meylan 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "this supports the suggestion that at least these 2 systems with high @xmath0 ratios might actually be the remaining cores of dwarf elliptical galaxies instead of real gcs .",
    "the chemical enrichment model of dekel and silk ( 1986 ) might explain the observed correlation between ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath25 $ ] . to demonstrate this we adopt a universal initial baryon - to - dark matter mass fraction @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the gas and dark matter mass , respectively .",
    "we assume that the satellites formed through a first period of star formation which might have had several epochs of quiescence and which ended when the rest of the gas was ejected either by a strong galactic wind and/or through tidal stripping . during the star formation epoch",
    "it is likely that hot metal - enriched gas was also lost in a continuous wind .",
    "as demonstrated by mac low and ferrara ( 1999 ) supernova driven galactic winds could blow out a large fraction of the newly produced metals without removing much gas or destroying the galaxy .",
    "if we define the effective yield @xmath30 as the mass fraction of metals that were produced by newly formed stars and that were not ejected in the wind , the mean iron abundance of the stellar system can be approximated for low metallicities as              for a typical initial mass function the expected iron yield is 0.04 as inferred e.g. from the most metal - rich stellar systems which on average have metallicities of twice the solar metallicity .",
    "this yield could be reduced roughly by a factor of 3 if supernovae type ia did not contribute . however , even in this case , the yield would be an order of magnitude too large .",
    "this problem can be solved if we postulate a continuous outflow of hot metal - rich gas during the star formation phase in satellite galaxies which removed 90% of the iron with only 10% being retained .    in summary ,",
    "the observed correlation between the mass - to - light ratio and the metallicity of dwarf satellites can be explained by a simple chemical model of continuous loss of metals with a final gas ejection phase at the end of the star formation epoch .",
    "although this approach is promising it is not clear why the fraction of metals ejected in the wind should be independent of the total mass or surface density .",
    "more sophisticated models will be required to understand the origin of the fundamental line in details .",
