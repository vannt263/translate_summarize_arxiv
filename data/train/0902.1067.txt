    "in the standard inflationary scenario , the scales of cosmological interest exit the hubble radius within the first few ( about @xmath0-@xmath1 ) @xmath2-folds of inflation and , hence , are outside the hubble scale during the later epochs .",
    "when comparing the predictions of the inflationary models with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the large scale structure data , it is often assumed that the amplitude of the curvature perturbations remain constant at super - hubble scales .",
    "in such a situation , the observed cmb anisotropies directly determine the amplitude and the shape of the perturbation spectrum imprinted on the modes when they left the hubble radius during inflation .",
    "typically , the amplitude of the perturbations constrain the parameters that describe the inflaton potential , while the shape of the spectrum limits its form  ( see any of the standard texts  @xcite or one of the following reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "provided inflation is of the slow roll type for _ all _ of the required number of @xmath2-folds , it is indeed true that the amplitude of the curvature perturbations freeze at their value at hubble exit .",
    "however , if there is a period of deviation from slow roll inflation , then the asymptotic ( i.e. the extreme super - hubble ) amplitude of the modes that leave the hubble radius just before the deviation are enhanced when compared to their value at hubble exit  @xcite . while modes that leave well before the deviation remain unaffected ,",
    "it is found that there exists an intermediate range of modes whose amplitudes are actually suppressed at super - hubble scales  @xcite . depending on the form of the departure from slow roll ,",
    "these effects lead to certain features in the scalar perturbation spectrum .",
    "if such deviations occur either during or soon after the cosmological scales leave the hubble radius , then the cmb observations constrain the resulting features rather well ( for an inexhaustive list , see refs .",
    "but , at smaller scales , only theoretical tools are currently available to restrict the form of the primordial spectrum .",
    "these constraints are essentially based on the number density of primordial black holes that are formed towards the end of inflation ( for recent discussions in this context , see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite )    since the cosmological scales are well outside the hubble radius by the early stages of inflation , clearly , the _ shape _ of the perturbation spectrum on such large scales is indeed unlikely to be affected by subsequent dynamics .",
    "but , over the past decade , it has been recognized that post - inflationary dynamics can alter the _ amplitude _ of the curvature perturbations at super - hubble scales , in particular , when more than one component of matter is present .",
    "preheating , the curvaton scenario and the modulated reheating mechanism are popular examples that illustrate the interesting possibilities of post - inflationary dynamics . preheating  a mechanism that transfers energy from the inflaton to radiation through an explosive production of quanta corresponding to an intermediate scalar field ",
    "is known to even lead to an exponential growth in the amplitude of the super - hubble perturbations ( for the earlier discussions , see refs .",
    "@xcite and , for more recent efforts , see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the curvaton scenario , while the inflationary epoch still remains the source of the perturbations , these perturbations are amplified after inflation due to the presence of entropic perturbations ( see , for example , refs .",
    "the modulated reheating scenario is an extreme case wherein inflation is essentially required only to resolve the horizon problem , whereas the perturbations are generated due to an inhomogeneous decay rate when the energy is being transferred from the inflaton to radiation through other fields  @xcite .",
    "these different alternatives indicate that the post - inflationary evolution of the large scale curvature perturbations can be highly model dependent and , therefore , requires a careful and systematic study .",
    "evidently , in these scenarios , the effects of post - inflationary dynamics have to be taken into account when constraining the inflationary models using the cmb observations ( in this context , see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    with these motivations in mind , in this paper , we investigate the problem of the more conventional reheating scenario  @xcite , and its effects on the evolution of the curvature perturbations in tachyonic inflationary models ( for the original discussions on the tachyon , see refs .",
    "@xcite ; for efforts on treating the tachyon as an inflaton , see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite ; for discussions on reheating in such inflationary models , see refs .",
    "we shall consider two types of potentials to describe the tachyon and construct scenarios of transition from inflation to radiation domination for the following three possible cases of the decay rate @xmath3 of the tachyon into radiation : ( i )  a constant , ( ii )  dependent on the tachyon , and ( iii )  explicitly dependent on time .",
    "we solve the coupled equations for the system numerically and study the evolution of the perturbations from the sub - hubble to the super - hubble scales .",
    "importantly , we shall consider the effects of the transition from inflation to the radiation dominated epoch on the evolution of the large scale ( i.e. those that correspond to cosmological scales today ) curvature and non - adiabatic pressure ( i.e. the intrinsic entropy as well as the relative entropy or the isocurvature ) perturbations .",
    "we shall evaluate the spectrum of curvature perturbations at the end of inflation as well as at the early stages of the radiation dominated epoch .",
    "as we shall illustrate , reheating affects the amplitude of the curvature perturbations _ only _ when the decay rate of the tachyon into radiation is explicitly time dependent",
    ". we shall also show that it is the growth of the isocurvature perturbation ( i.e. the relative non - adiabatic pressure perturbation between the tachyon and radiation ) that induces the change in the amplitude of the curvature perturbations during the transition .",
    "our results confirm similar conclusions that have been arrived at earlier in the literature based on the study of the evolution of the perturbations in the super - hubble limit  @xcite . we shall also discuss similar effects in the case of the canonical scalar field .",
    "a few clarifying remarks are in order at this stage of the discussion .",
    "we should stress that the set up we are considering is the standard cold inflationary scenario , followed by an epoch of reheating achieved by the standard method of introducing a coarse - grained decay rate in the equation of motion describing the inflaton  @xcite .",
    "recently , an analysis somewhat similar to what we shall consider here has been studied in the context of warm inflationary scenarios involving tachyonic fields  @xcite . though there can exist similarities in the form of the equations in the cold and the warm inflationary scenarios , the physics in these two scenarios are rather different ( for a recent discussion , see , for example , ref .",
    "moreover , to analyze the effects of reheating on the large scale perturbations , one could have possibly studied the evolution of the perturbations in the super - hubble limit , say , the first order ( in time ) differential equations usually considered in the literature ( cf",
    "however , some concerns have been raised that the coupling between the inflaton and radiation may affect the amplitude as well as the scalar spectral index in certain situations  @xcite .",
    "also , the modified background dynamics preceding reheating can effect the extent of small scale primordial black holes that are formed towards the end of inflation .",
    "if we are to address such issues , it requires that we study the evolution of the perturbations from the sub - hubble to the super - hubble scales .",
    "we shall comment further on some of these points in the concluding section .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the following section",
    ", we shall summarize the essential background equations for the system consisting of the tachyon and a perfect fluid and set up scenarios of transition from inflation to radiation domination . in",

    "in the ucg , the gauge invariant bardeen potential  @xmath107 is given by = a+a(b+h b ) . upon using the first order einstein equations , and , it can be shown that the bardeen potential satisfies the differential equation  @xcite + (4 + 3 c__a^2 ) h + [2 h+3 h^2 (1 + c__a^2 ) ] + - ( ) ^2 = (4 g ) p^_na , [ eq : emphi ] where @xmath108 denotes the adiabatic speed of sound in the composite system , and the quantity @xmath109 is the non - adiabatic pressure perturbation defined as p^_na = (p - c__a^2 ) . using the einstein equations   and  , the total curvature perturbation @xmath86 of the system can be written in terms of the bardeen potential  @xmath107 as follows  @xcite : = +  ( )  ( ) .

    "[ eq : emrdot ] this equation clearly suggests that , at super - hubble scales , any change in the amplitude of the curvature perturbations has to be due to the non - trivial evolution of the non - adiabatic pressure perturbation @xmath109 .",
    "the perfect fluid , by definition , does not possess any intrinsic entropy perturbation .",
    "therefore , the non - adiabatic pressure perturbation @xmath109 of our composite system depends on the intrinsic non - adiabatic pressure perturbation of the tachyon , say , @xmath110 , and the relative non - adiabatic pressure perturbation between the tachyon and the perfect fluid ( i.e. the isocurvature perturbation ) , which we shall denote as @xmath111 .",

    "for this reason , to illustrate the evolution of the non - adiabatic pressure perturbations , we choose to work with a very small scale mode that leaves the hubble radius close to the end of inflation .",
    "since the inflationary epoch is of the slow roll type for all the @xmath2-folds , the non - adiabatic pressure perturbations associated with the cosmological scales can be expected to behave in a fashion similar to that associated with such a small scale mode . ] .",
    "the following points are evident from the three plots . to begin with , barring a very small change in its amplitude  which is expected during the transition from inflation to the radiation dominated epoch ",
    "the bardeen potential @xmath107 remains a constant at super - hubble scales .",
    "secondly , it is clear from the plots that the intrinsic entropy perturbation associated with the tachyon decays as @xmath121 at super - hubble scales during inflation , a result that is well known in the literature ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "thirdly , and interestingly , we find that the isocurvature perturbation behaves in almost the same fashion as the intrinsic entropy perturbation both before and after the transition , a feature that has been noticed earlier  @xcite . while they both behave as @xmath121 at super - hubble scales before the transition , they die down _ extremely _ rapidly ( roughly as @xmath122 ! ) during the radiation dominated epoch .",
    "lastly , it is also evident from the third plot that , when the decay rate is a function of time , while the intrinsic entropy perturbation continues to decay , the isocurvature perturbation exhibits a brief period of growth close to the transition before decaying . obviously , it is this growth of the isocurvature perturbations that is responsible for the amplification of the curvature perturbations during the transition .",
    "in this work , we have studied the evolution of perturbations in an interacting system consisting of a tachyon and radiation . treating the tachyon as an inflaton",
    ", we have investigated the effects of reheating ",
    "i.e . the perturbative transfer of energy from the tachyon to radiation  on the large scale curvature perturbations .",
    "we have shown that the transition does not alter the amplitude of the total curvature perturbation of the system when the rate describing the decay of the inflaton into radiation is either a constant or a function of the tachyon . however , we find that the total curvature perturbation is modified when the decay rate associated with the tachyon turns out to be explicitly dependent on time .",
    "we find that , for the specific functional form of the decay rate that we work with , the overall amplitude of the power spectrum is enhanced ( by a factor of about @xmath123 ) during the transition .",
    "we have also been able to explicitly illustrate that it is the growth of the isocurvature perturbations close to the transition is responsible for the amplification of the curvature perturbations .",
    "it may be considered an overkill to integrate the second order differential equations rather than work with the much simpler first order equations  @xcite .",
    "our motivations were threefold .",
    "importantly , our effort allowed us to cross - check certain previous results  @xcite .",
    "also , our aim is to later study the effects of deviations from slow roll inflation as well as the effects of the modified dynamics close to the transition to the radiation dominated epoch on the small scale perturbations .",
    "as we had mentioned in the introduction , these effects can have interesting implications on the number of primordial black holes that are formed towards the end of inflation  @xcite . moreover , in possibilities such as the warm inflationary scenario , the decay rate , in addition to depending on the inflaton , can also depend on the temperature ( see , for example , refs .",
    "in such a case , the transfer of the energy from the inflaton to radiation may affect the amplitude and possibly the spectral index as well  @xcite .",
    "we would like to conclude by commenting on our choices for @xmath124 and @xmath106 .",
    "as we had pointed our earlier , our choices were motivated by convenience in numerical evolution rather than physics .",
    "obviously , better motivated functional forms of these quantities need to be investigated .",
    "in particular , it will be interesting to understand whether there exist @xmath106 that suppress the amplitude of the curvature perturbations during the transition rather than enhance them .",
    "such a possibility is worth exploring as it can lead to an increase in the tensor - to - scalar ratio post inflation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ; however , see also ref .",
    "we are currently investigating these issues .",
    "in this appendix , we shall illustrate the corresponding effects for the case of the canonical scalar field model that was considered recently in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we shall rapidly summarize the essential equations describing the background evolution and the perturbations , and present the results .",

    "<S> we investigate the problem of reheating and its effects on the evolution of the curvature perturbations in tachyonic inflationary models . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the equations governing the evolution of the scalar perturbations for a system consisting of a tachyon and a perfect fluid . assuming the perfect fluid to be radiation </S>",
    "<S> , we solve the coupled equations for the system numerically and study the evolution of the perturbations from the sub - hubble to the super - hubble scales . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we analyze the effects of the transition from tachyon driven inflation to the radiation dominated epoch on the evolution of the large scale curvature and non - adiabatic pressure perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> we consider two different potentials to describe the tachyon and study the effects of three possible types of decay of the tachyon into radiation . </S>",
    "<S> we plot the spectrum of curvature perturbations at the end of inflation as well as at the early stages of the radiation dominated epoch . </S>",
    "<S> we find that reheating modifies the amplitude of the curvature perturbations _ only _ when the decay rate of the tachyon into radiation is explicitly time - dependent . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate that it is the growth of the relative non - adiabatic pressure perturbation between the tachyon and radiation that is responsible for the change in the amplitude of the curvature perturbations during the transition . </S>",
    "<S> our results corroborate similar conclusions that have been arrived at earlier based on the study of the evolution of the perturbations in the super - hubble limit . in an appendix </S>",
    "<S> , we also discuss the corresponding results for the popular chaotic inflation model in the case of the canonical scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly comment on the possible implications of our results . </S>"
