    "one of the long - standing experimental and theoretical challenges within nuclear physics is the determination of the nucleus available quantum levels and the decay properties of these levels in the excitation - energy region between the ground state and up to the particle threshold(s ) . in this intermediate excitation - energy region , often called the _ quasicontinuum _ , the _ nuclear level density _ ( nld ) and the average , reduced @xmath0-decay probability , i.e. the _ @xmath0-strength function _ ( @xmath0sf ) , shed light on the dynamic behavior of the nucleus . apart from providing information on basic nuclear properties ,",
    "these quantities are also indispensable input for calculations of , e.g. , neutron - capture cross sections .",
    "these cross sections are of great importance for applications such as the astrophysical heavy - element nucleosynthesis  @xcite and modeling of next - generation nuclear power plants  @xcite .",
    "amongst a handful of experimental techniques , the oslo method  @xcite has been established as one of the promising approaches to obtain experimental information on the nld and @xmath0sf .",
    "the advantage of the oslo method compared to other techniques is that both these quantities can be extracted from one and the same experiment , utilizing typically a charged - particle reaction to record particle-@xmath0 coincidences , in which the structural shape of the nld and the @xmath0sf can be determined . by measuring the energy of the outgoing charged particle ,",
    "the initial excitation energy of the residual nucleus is determined .",
    "the @xmath0 rays de - exciting this initial excitation energy are recorded in coincidence , thus obtaining @xmath0 spectra as function of initial excitation - energy .    in 2004 ,",
    "an unexpected enhancement of the @xmath0sf for low transition energies ( @xmath9 mev ) was discovered in the iron isotopes @xmath1fe  @xcite .",
    "this feature was not predicted by any theoretically derived @xmath0sfs . in the following years ,",
    "upbend _ was found in many medium - mass nuclei , including @xmath10sc  @xcite , @xmath11ni  @xcite , @xmath12ge  @xcite , and mo isotopes  @xcite . to date , the heaviest nuclei where the upbend has been seen are @xmath13la  @xcite and @xmath14sm  @xcite .",
    "the upbend was experimentally shown to be of dipole nature in @xmath7fe  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been demonstrated  @xcite that such a low - energy enhancement in the @xmath0sf could significantly increase radiative neutron - capture rates of relevance for the @xmath15-process  if found to be present in very neutron - rich nuclei .    in 2012",
    ", the upbend was independently confirmed in @xmath16mo  @xcite using a different technique .",
    "this triggered theoretical investigations of the origin of this phenomenon . within the thermal - continuum quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( tcqrpa ) , the upbend was explained as due to @xmath17 transitions caused by thermal single - quasiparticle excitations in the continuum  @xcite , with its strength depending on the nuclear temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "shell - model calculations  @xcite show a strong increase in @xmath18 strength for low - energy @xmath19 transitions . at present",
    ", @xmath11ni is the only case where experimental data favor a magnetic character of the upbend  @xcite .",
    "more experimental information is needed in order to determine whether the upbend is dominantly of magnetic or electric character , or a mixture of both .    in this work ,",
    "we present nlds and @xmath0sfs of @xmath1fe extracted from ( p , p@xmath20@xmath0 ) coincidences .",
    "we analyze systematic errors in the normalization procedure and compare our results to available data in the literature . for the first time",

    "similarly , the distribution of primary @xmath0 rays as function of @xmath40 depends on the level density at @xmath62 and the @xmath0-transmission coefficient @xmath63 for the @xmath0 transition with energy @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath0-transmission coefficient is directly proportional to the @xmath0sf .",

    "the primary @xmath0-ray matrices @xmath65 for @xmath1fe are shown in figure  [ fig : fg_rsg_matrices ] .",
    "they are normalized for each excitation - energy bin so that @xmath66 .",
    "this means that the probability for @xmath0 decay from a given bin is 1 , and that the intensity of a given @xmath0-ray energy reflects the branching ratio for that particular transition energy .",
    "these matrices are used as input for the extraction of the nld and @xmath0sf for the four data sets . the expression in equation",
    "[ eq : brink ] is valid for statistical decay , i.e. where the decay is independent of the formation of the compound state  @xcite .",

    "the sum of all primary transitions for each @xmath40 bin is normalized to unity .",
    "as the @xmath65 matrices contain many more data points ( `` pixels '' ) than the free parameters ( the vector elements of @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) , the solution is uniquely determined and the fit routine converges fast , typically within 10 - 20 iterations .    some considerations need to be made before extracting the nld and @xmath0sf from the data .",
    "first , a low - energy limit for the excitation energy is applied to avoid the discrete region at low @xmath40 , for which the condition of a compound - nucleus decay is highly questionable .",
    "further , an upper limit @xmath73 must be given , which typically corresponds to @xmath46 , as neutrons are not measured or discriminated in the present experimental setup .",
    "finally , a low - energy limit on the @xmath0 energy , @xmath74 , is determined to exclude eventual higher - generation transitions not properly subtracted in the primary - distribution extraction , as discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "the chosen energy limits for the extraction procedure are : @xmath75 mev , @xmath76 mev , and @xmath77 mev for @xmath7fe ; correspondingly , @xmath78 mev , @xmath79 mev , and @xmath80 mev for @xmath5fe .",
    "the neutron separation energies @xmath46 are 11.197 mev and 7.646 mev for @xmath1fe , respectively .",
    "the reason why we are able to put @xmath73 higher than @xmath46 in the case of @xmath5fe , is that the first - excited state in @xmath7fe is at 847 kev , allowing in principle for @xmath81 mev = 8.5 mev as we are requiring proton-@xmath0 coincidences .",
    "similarly , for @xmath5fe , the upper limit is @xmath82 100 kev above @xmath46 .    to test the quality of the fit , which is based on all primary spectra included in the extraction procedure ,",

    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : diw_56fe_nai ] .",

    "<S> angular distributions of the low - energy enhancement in @xmath5fe indicate its dipole nature .    the high statistics and the excellent energy resolution of the large - volume labr@xmath8(ce ) detectors allowed for a thorough analysis of the @xmath0-ray strength function as a function of excitation energy . </S>",
    "<S> strong fluctuations were found for the direct decay to the ground band , while the decay into the quasi - continuum shows a more uniform behavior . </S>",
    "<S> there is no indication of any significant excitation - energy dependence in the @xmath0-ray strength function , in support of the generalized brink - axel hypothesis .    </S>",
