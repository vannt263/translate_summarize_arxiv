    "many complex networks have richer structures than graphs can have . inherently they have hypergraph structures : interconnections often cross multiple nodes . treating these networks as graphs causes a loss of some structures . nonetheless , it is still popular to use graph tools to study these networks ; one of them is the laplacian spectrum .",
