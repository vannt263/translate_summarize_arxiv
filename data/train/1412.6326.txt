    "the strong coupling constant @xmath0 is one of the three fundamental gauge coupling constants of the standard model of particle physics and it is thus of utmost importance to measure it with high precision .",
    "hadronic @xmath1 decays provide an especially clean environment for the study of qcd effects and in particular the determination of @xmath0 . at the @xmath1 mass scale ,",
    "its value is predicted to be larger than that at higher energy due to the energy dependence based on the renormalization group equations .",
    "consequently , the hadronic branching ratio of the tau decays @xmath3 is expected to be much larger than the predicted value of 3/5 at the quark - parton level and ignoring quark masses .",
    "the sizable deviation is indeed measured and this has been used together with the measured spectral functions of the @xmath1 hadronic decays to determine @xmath4 as well as small non - perturbative contributions using a method proposed in  @xcite .",
    "measurements performed by aleph  @xcite , cleo  @xcite and opal  @xcite are briefly reviewed in the following together with other determinations , focusing on the latest aleph results . over the years",
    ", the two main improvements in the measurement of @xmath5 were from the increased precision of the branching ratio and spectral function measurements and the higher - order perturbative calculation .",
    "experimentally , one measures branching ratios of all leptonic , non - strange and strange hadronic decay modes of the @xmath1 decays ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the non - strange decay modes can be further decomposed into vector and axial - vector components , corresponding to channels with an even and odd number of neutral or charged pions , respectively .",
    "the ratio of the total hadronic tau decay width to the leptonic one , @xmath6 , can thus be determined with a precise universal electronic branching fraction , @xmath7 , only .",
    "it is an average over the directly measured @xmath8 and two derived ones from the measured @xmath9 and tau lifetime @xmath10 .",
    "in addition to the measured branching ratios , spectral functions of the v , a and s components are also measured .",
    "these are invariant mass spectra normalized to their branching ratios and corrected for @xmath1 decay kinematics , e.g. for v and a , @xmath11    on the theoretical side , using the operator product expansion ( ope )  @xcite , the inclusive vector and axial - vector @xmath1 hadronic width and spectral functions can be expressed as a function of @xmath0 and non - perturbative phenomenological operators  @xcite : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 denotes the ckm weak mixing matrix element , @xmath15 accounts for electroweak radiative corrections  @xcite , the term @xmath16 is the dominant massless perturbative contribution , @xmath17 corresponds to the residual non - logarithmic electroweak correction  @xcite , @xmath18 arises from quark masses which is smaller than 0.1% for the @xmath19 quarks , and @xmath20 are the ope terms in powers of @xmath21 .",
    "depending on how the perturbative series is truncated , there are different schemes in the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "the two most used schemes are the fixed - order perturbation theory ( fopt ) expansion and the contour - improved perturbation theory ( cipt ) expansion  @xcite .",
    "the parameter of interest is @xmath5 , if one only considers 3 non - perturbative terms @xmath20 with @xmath22 , one has 4 free parameters to determine .",
    "this is achieved by a simultaneous fit to @xmath23 and 4 spectral moments @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "only 4 spectra moments are used because of the strong correlation . in practice the normalized spectral moments @xmath27 are used in order decouple the normalization from the shape of the @xmath1 spectral functions .",
    "the measurement of @xmath0 at the tau mass scale was carried out for the first time by aleph in 1993 using about 8500 @xmath1 decays  @xcite .",
    "this is followed by cleo in 1995  @xcite and by opal in 1999  @xcite using the same technique .",
    "aleph has also made several updates .",
    "the update in 1998  @xcite was based on about 30 times of more data than those used in  @xcite and @xmath0 was determined for the first time with three independent spectral functions @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath31 spectral function also allowed the evaluation of the finite energy chiral sum rules up to the @xmath1 mass .",
    "the approach of the ope was also tested experimentally studying the evolution of the @xmath1 hadronic widths to masses smaller than the @xmath1 mass . the update in 2005  @xcite used the full lep-1 data set with the final branching ratio measurements based on extensive systematic studies .    using the same data , two additional improvements were realized . the first one in 2008  @xcite includes the new fourth - order perturbative coefficient  @xcite which reduces the dominant theoretical uncertainty due to the truncation of the series by 20% with respect to earlier determinations based on the third - order expansion , better separation between vector and axial - vector spectral functions by using the new precise @xmath32 annihilation cross section measurements from babar , and improved results from babar and belle on @xmath1 branching ratios involving kaons .",
    "the second one in 2013  @xcite updated the non - strange spectral functions by using a new and more robust method  @xcite to unfold the measured mass spectra from detector effects .",
    "the procedure also corrected a problem in the correlations between the unfolded mass bins missing in the previous spectral functions  @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the new spectral functions with the old one is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sf_comp ] for two example cases .",
    "reasonable agreement is found everywhere except for differences at the few percent level in the @xmath33 mode near threshold and in the @xmath34 region .",
    "spectral functions .",
    "the shaded areas indicate the contributions from the exclusive @xmath1 decay channels , where the shapes of the contributions labelled  mc \" are taken from the mc simulation .",

    "[ fig : newsf ] .",
    "the dashed line depicts the naive parton model prediction while the solid line shows the massless perturbative qcd prediction using @xmath35 .",
    "although the statistical power of the data is weak near the kinematic limit , the trend of the spectral functions clearly indicates the asymptotic region is not reached for @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "on the other hand , the oscillating behavior of the @xmath30 does approximately reach the asymptotic limit .",
    "this implies that the non - perturbative effects in @xmath30 are smaller than those from @xmath28 or @xmath29 as it was observed indeed from the individual fits to these spectral functions .",
    "consequently , the @xmath5 determination from @xmath30 is believed to be the most robust one among the three spectral functions .",
    "the corresponding cipt fit result  @xcite is @xmath36 , where the first error is experimental and the second the theoretical one .",
    "when averaged with the fopt fit result , one gets @xmath37 , the larger theoretical error includes half of the cipt and fopt difference ( @xmath38 ) , which after evolution to @xmath39 gives @xmath40 , where the third error is due to the evolution .",
    "the result is in excellent agreement with @xmath41 , the theoretically most robust precision determination ( also based on fourth - order computation ) from the global fit ( gfitter ) to electroweak data at the @xmath2 mass scale  @xcite .    a compilation of these described @xmath5 measurements with other determinations is shown in fig .",
    "most of these other determinations  @xcite were based directly or indirectly on the earlier versions of the spectral functions from aleph .",
    "only two recent determinations  @xcite were obtained using the spectral functions of opal .",
    "one major difference of the latter determinations with the others is the introduction of duality violation with a model containing four additional parameters .",
    "this together with the limited precision of the opal data explained larger uncertainties on these @xmath0 determinations .   and the duality violation effects ,",
    "could no longer be used given the precision of the data .",
    "however , the existing studies do not allow to draw an unambiguous conclusion on this point . ]",
    "based on the @xmath1 hadronic decays , where cipt stands for contour - improved perturbation theory , fopt for fixed - order perturbation theory , bsr for borel summation of renormalon series , pwm for pinched - weight moments , rcpt for renormalon chain perturbation theory , apt for analytic perturbation theory , mcipt for modified cipt , dv for duality violation .",
    "the experimental uncertainty is shown as the inner error bar when available . ]",
    "the determination of the strong coupling constant @xmath5 at the @xmath1 mass scale using the branching ratios and spectral functions of the non - strange @xmath1 hadronic decays has been briefly described and reviewed .",
    "the impact of the revised spectral functions of aleph on @xmath5 is found to be small .",
    "it is one of the few @xmath0 measurements performed with perturbative predictions known at fourth - order .",
    "because the @xmath0 uncertainty scales with @xmath42 , when it is extrapolated to the @xmath2 mass , it yields one of the most precise @xmath0 determinations .",
    "the good agreement with the other independent measurements at the @xmath2 mass pole also tests the asymptotic freedom of the qcd with unprecedented precision .",
