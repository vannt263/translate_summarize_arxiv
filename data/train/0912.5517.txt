    "the klebanov - strassler ( ks ) theory  @xcite is one of the most interesting examples of the holographic correspondence  @xcite .",
    "it provides the dual description of a @xmath8 supersymmetric non - conformal gauge theory with dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and confinement .",
    "a relatively simple construction from the point of view of the correspondence , it is often proposed to model the real world physics in such areas as viable string compactifications , inflation , supersymmetry breaking and more ( e.g. in  @xcite ) .",
    "our motivation for working with the ks solution is the analysis of the low energy degrees of freedom ( glueballs ) of a theory that is a close relative of the pure gauge @xmath8 supersymmetric yang - mills theory .",
    "holographic methods applied to such a class of theories could provide qualitative estimates for physical observables in the strong coupling regime .",
    "in particular such estimates would be useful in the setup discussed in  @xcite , where we are interested in computing transition matrix elements of operators in the strongly coupled hidden sector  @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to test the holography against the theoretical predictions on glueballs in qcd  @xcite . for further motivation for calculation of glueball spectra using holographic correspondence",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "in this work we continue a series of earlier publications on the spectrum of glueballs in the ks theory  @xcite@xcite .",
    "we are interested in the singlets with respect to the global @xmath1 symmetry , since this sector contains the states of the pure gauge @xmath8 theory .",
    "we only study bosonic states , since the spectrum of fermions is automatically restored by supersymmetry .    as usual",
    "the glueballs are classified by the @xmath9 quantum numbers .",
    "the value of @xmath10 can be determined as follows . as one learns from  @xcite",
    "there is a @xmath11 symmetry of the ks solution , which is realized as the swap of the two @xmath12 in the base of the conifold followed by flipping the signs of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 forms . in the dual gauge theory it corresponds to the interchange of the bifundamental fields @xmath15 combined with the charge conjugation .",
    "therefore this symmetry , called the @xmath0-symmetry , determines the @xmath10 conjugation properties of the bulk modes .",
    "the glueball sector odd under the @xmath0 conjugation was completely studied in  @xcite . in the @xmath0-even sector the spectrum of @xmath4 states was computed in  @xcite and the graviton multiplet containing @xmath16 and @xmath3 glueballs was studied in  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we find another @xmath3 glueball in this sector , which turns out to be degenerate with one of the seven @xmath4 , and show that there are no other singlet vector states . together with the previous results this allows us to conclude that all singlet supermultiplets are known and we propose the full spectrum of singlet glueballs in the ks theory .",
    "the only missing states are the six pseudoscalars @xmath17 that are members of the scalar multiplets together with the six @xmath4 .",
    "the pseudoscalar states will be discussed in the future work  @xcite .    a comment on the spectrum of @xmath4 states is required .",
    "the seven equations for those states form a complicated coupled system  @xcite , which has not been diagonalized so far .",
    "therefore the mass eigenvalues are only known as elements of a single set without assignments to individual glueballs .",
    "the spectrum of the new @xmath3 glueball allows to separate one of the seven eigenvalue subsets and find one of the eigenvectors of the system .    under the assumption that the glueball mass squared fits well a quadratic dependence we try to extract the remaining six @xmath4 states from the combined spectrum of  @xcite .",
    "the assumption is certainly true for other glueballs studied previously .",
    "nevertheless we can confidently extract only two more sub - spectra , which correspond to heavier states .",
    "this signifies that either the quadraticity of the spectra is violated by lighter glueballs , or numerics does not work so well for small eigenvalues in the coupled system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we study the general @xmath0-even singlet vector ansatz .",
    "we show that apart from the @xmath3 dual to the @xmath2 current there is only one more vector glueball . in section  3",
    "we compute its spectrum and find that it is degenerate with one of the seven scalars of  @xcite . the supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( sqm )",
    "is used to derive the equation for the @xmath4 superpartner . in section  4",
    "we analyze the full spectrum of @xmath4 states from  @xcite .",
    "we conclude in section  5 with a remark on dual operators and proposal of the complete spectrum of @xmath1 singlet @xmath8 supermultiplets in the ks theory .",
    "in this section we are going to consider the general ansatz for the @xmath0-even vector fluctuations invariant under the global @xmath1 symmetry of the ks solution . to construct the ansatz we use the basis of @xmath1 invariant one- and two - forms .- values of the basis forms . ]",
    "we represent all 4-dimensional vector fluctuations by bold face 1-forms , e.g. @xmath18 ; assuming the notation @xmath19 and transversality @xmath20 in what follows @xmath21 are the 4-dimensional coordinates , @xmath22 is a radial coordinate on the deformed conifold , @xmath23 is the deformation parameter and @xmath24 is a @xmath0-even @xmath1-invariant 1-form on the base of the conifold",
    ". explicit form of various background functions used in the derivation can be found in the appendix .",
    "first of all , we notice that there are no @xmath0-even vector fluctuations of the 3-forms @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this follows from the fact that they should flip the sign under the @xmath0 conjugation while the only @xmath0-odd basis forms are certain two - forms supported on the conifold .",
    "the only singlet vector fluctuation of the metric has the form [ genmet ansatz ] ( s^2 ) = ( g^5 + ) .",
    "taking into account this modification of the metric the general self - dual fluctuation of the 5-form reads @xmath25 the ansatz ( [ genmet ansatz]-[gen5 ansatz ] ) is the most general ansatz for singlet @xmath0-even vector fluctuations .",
    "the equations that are modified by the ansatz at the linear level are the following :    * the bianchi identity @xmath26 gives the equations ",
    "+ = 0 , -+  + * _ 4= 0 , +   + * _ 4 = 0 , * _ 4 = 0 , ( h^1/2g^11g^33(g^55)^2*_4) + 2h^1/2(g^11)^2(g^33)^2(*_4-_4 ) + * _ 4=0 .",
    "* three equations come from the components of the einstein equation : , @xmath27 and @xmath28 introduced in  @xcite .",
    "expressions for them in the ks case can be found in the appendix . ] -r _ = - 12(__ + _ _  ) - ( a-6p)(__+ _ _ ) = 0 , @xmath29 @xmath30    the other supergravity equations remain unaltered at the linearized level .",
    "four of the five bianchi identity equations can be solved to express everything in terms of the functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the only one remaining equation is [ general f5 eqn ] _  + ( 2-)_ - 89 + ^2_- = 0 , where we have redefined = , and substituted for the 4-laplacian , @xmath33 , its eigenvalue _",
    "4m_4 ^ 2 = ^2 .",
    "there is no non - trivial equation for @xmath34 from the einstein equation .",
    "the only non - trivial equation that we obtain is the one involving @xmath35 and @xmath32 , [ gen metric eqn ] _  + ( 2-)_ -89 + ^2_+23 = 0 . the general ansatz  ( [ genmet ansatz]-[gen5 ansatz ] ) leads to only two equations  ( [ general f5 eqn ] ) and  ( [ gen metric eqn ] ) .",
    "in fact it reduces to the simplest generalization of the ansatz in  @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to diagonalize the system of equations  ( [ general f5 eqn ] ) and  ( [ gen metric eqn ] ) .",
    "apparently there is a solution @xmath36 .",
    "this is the solution found in  @xcite , which corresponds to the @xmath3 glueball dual to the dimension @xmath37 operator of the @xmath2 current in the gauge theory .",
    "[ vector v ] _  + ( 2-)_ - + ^2_- = 0 .",
    "the other mode can be found by subtracting the first equation from the second one . introducing a new function @xmath38 we obtain [ vector w ] _  + ( 2-)_- + ^2_+ 2_=0 .",
    "this vector mode corresponds to an operator of dimension @xmath39 . in the limit of the singular klebanov - tseytlin ( kt )",
    "solution  @xcite the equation  ( [ vector w ] ) coincides with one of the vector equations found in  @xcite .    cc a ) in normalization of  @xcite & b ) in normalization of  @xcite +    .first few @xmath40 eigenvalues and quadratic fit for the vector  ( [ vector w ] ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + @xmath41 & @xmath42",
    "we compute the spectrum of vector  ( [ vector w ] ) numerically and present the results in table  [ tab w eigenvals ] .",
    "the first 9 eigenvalues match with a good accuracy a subset of the eigenvalues computed by berg , haack and mck ( bhm ) in  @xcite . in table  5 of  @xcite these eigenvalues are at positions @xmath43 . for large values of the radial quantum number @xmath44",
    "this subset has periodicity seven as expected .",
    "as we discuss below the degeneracy can be expected from the supermultiplet analysis .",
    "thus the pseudovector @xmath45 is the superpartner of one of the seven scalars in  @xcite .",
    "the scalar superpartner should correspond to either dimension @xmath46 or @xmath47 . starting with rewriting the equation  ( [ vector w ] ) in the form [ shroedinger ]  - v + ^2=0 , where v = -12 + + 89 - 2 , and applying the sqm transformation following  @xcite and  @xcite we obtain the superpartner equation : [ superpartner eqn ]  _ s - v_s _ s + ^2_s = 0 , where the potential @xmath48 is [ superpartner potential ] v_s= - + .",
    "the asymptotic form of the superpartner equation at the boundary @xmath49 is  _ s - _ s = 0 , which allows to establish the dimension of the dual operator to be @xmath50 .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that with the help of this trick with sqm we find one of the seven eigenvectors of the complicated system in  @xcite , which means that its rank can be reduced by one .",
    "we argue below that it is reasonable to expect that the rank can be further reduced at least by two , i.e. two more eigenvectors can be decoupled .",
    "in the works of bhm  @xcite an impressive effort was made to derive the spectrum of all @xmath4 glueballs in the ks background . as the result",
    "a system of linearized equations was computed and the spectrum of glueballs was found numerically .",
    "however the linearized system appeared to be coupled and complicated enough to discourage further efforts to diagonalize it .",
    "as a consequence in the spectrum computed in  @xcite the eigenvalues are mixed ( at least the lightest ones ) without the assignment to the individual glueball towers . as we have shown above , there should be a way to decouple at least one equation from the other six .",
    "we have presented the corresponding eigenvector  ( [ superpartner eqn ] ) .    comparing the results on the spectrum of @xmath3 and the table of @xmath4 eigenvalues",
    "we have confirmed that the vector belongs to a massive supermultiplet together with one of the scalars .",
    "we have therefore isolated a subset of eigenvalues from the full spectrum of @xmath4 .",
    "moreover we have noticed that the subset fits very well a quadratic form .",
    "this is also true about other glueball spectra , e.g. the ones of the @xmath0-odd states .",
    "therefore one could try to disentangle the eigenvalue system of bhm assuming that the remaining glueballs have a quadratic spectrum with a sufficient accuracy .",
    "multiplet . in what follows we will try to somewhat improve those results . ]",
    "as noticed in  @xcite for large values of @xmath51 the spectrum shows some periodic pattern with expected periodicity seven .",
    "we have employed the following approach .",
    "first we have obtained an initial fit for few ( 3 - 4 ) points , which appeared periodically , and afterwards added the points predicted by the trial fit and checked the stability of the trial fit with respect to such an extension of the data set .    despite the fact that this approach predicts several more points with a nice accuracy , in general it fails for light eigenvalues . besides the known subset of the @xmath3 multiplet we have only found two more stable fits .",
    "those correspond to the following subsets in table 5 of  @xcite :    * @xmath52 can be fitted with the parabola [ xtra glueball1 ] m_bhm^2 = 0.269 n^2 + 1.054n + 1.01 , * @xmath53 can be fitted by [ xtra glueball2 ] m_bhm^2 = 0.271 n^2 + 0.787n + 0.619 .    in figure",
    "[ fig fitting ] we show how the trial fits work in several examples . in case of stable fits it is enough to fit by 3 points .",
    "we also show several unstable fits .",
    "one of them is accidentally good if one considers just a 3-point fit .",
    "however it gets distorted after adding more points .",
    "moreover , the @xmath54 coefficient for this fit unusually deviates from the value @xmath55 , which should be more or less universal for all glueballs  @xcite .",
    "the reason that two glueball towers  ( [ xtra glueball1 ] ) and  ( [ xtra glueball2 ] ) are special is perhaps due to the fact that they are heavier and correspond to operators of larger dimensions ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated in  @xcite that in the kt limit these glueballs decouple from the remaining system .",
    "the lighter four glueballs correspond to the dimension @xmath57 operators such as the gluino bilinear and trace of energy - momentum tensor .",
    "these operators have large mixing and it is natural that corresponding glueballs also mix . based on the result of the above analysis and kt limit result one might expect that equations for glueballs ( [ xtra glueball1 ] ) and ( [ xtra glueball2 ] ) can be decoupled from the full system .",
    "in this work we have considered the most general ansatz for @xmath0-even @xmath1 singlet vector fluctuations of the type iib supergravity over the solution .",
    "the ansatz reduces to two non - trivial independent fluctuations , one of which is the pseudovector dual to the @xmath2 current operator .",
    "the second pseudovector is dual to an operator with the dimension @xmath39 and zero @xmath58-charge .    to determine the operator dual to the second @xmath3 one can scan the 5-dimensional superconformal multiplet classification  @xcite of the conformal theory on the conifold  @xcite .",
    "a @xmath1 singlet vector with dimension 7 only enters the type ii vector multiplet .",
    "this long multiplet is the analog of the reducible real superfield @xmath59 ; and the pseudovector is its @xmath60 component . in superfield notations",
    "the operator corresponding to the type ii vector multiplet is the operator @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath60 component of this operator is o_1^++= \\{,f_}^\\{|,f^ _ } + \\ { , _ } ^\\{|,^ _  } .",
    "we have computed the spectrum of the new @xmath3 glueball and found it to be degenerate ( with a very good accuracy ) with a subset of eigenvalues of the combined spectrum of the seven @xmath4 glueballs found in  @xcite .",
    "this signifies that the @xmath3 is in the same 4-dimensional @xmath8 multiplet with one of the seven @xmath4 .",
    "one could also anticipate this after analyzing the content of the superconformal vector multiplet  ii . in section  [ sqm ]",
    "we have established the dimension of the superpartner @xmath4 to be @xmath46 .",
    "therefore it corresponds to the lowest component of the @xmath61 operator , which is a 4-fermion operator o_0^++= || .",
    "= 4.5 in    the fact that there are no other vector states means that the only missing states from the spectrum are the pseudoscalars @xmath17 , which should necessarily form scalar multiplets with the remaining 6 scalars in  @xcite .",
    "given that the @xmath0-odd sector was fully studied in  @xcite and the spectrum of @xmath4 is known from  @xcite , we should know the full spectrum of @xmath1 singlet glueballs in the ks theory . here in figure  [ fig f1 ]",
    "we propose the structure of the full spectrum .    in figure  [ fig f1 ] each supermultiplet",
    "is represented by its bosonic members .",
    "the multiplets are labeled by the highest spin members except for scalar multiplets .",
    "there are two massless multiplets ",
    "scalar multiplets containing only one bosonic spin 0 state .",
    "the massive sector contains one tower of graviton multiplets , two towers of gravitino multiplets , four towers of vector multiplets and six towers of scalar multiplets .",
    "some of the scalar multiplets in figure  [ fig f1 ] appear without labels . as we discussed above one",
    "still has to disentangle six individual towers from the combined spectrum of @xmath4 in  @xcite . based on our analysis in section  [ berg spectrum ]",
    "we have extracted two heavier subspectra out of six , but the procedure did not work as well for the remaining four that appear in the first column .    since the spectrum of the four lightest @xmath4 deviates from the quadratic form it is also possible that the lightest eigenvalues are affected by a numerical error . as an independent check of the lightest eigenvalues one could try to compute the spectrum of the pseudoscalar superpartners , which would be a topic of a separate work  @xcite .",
