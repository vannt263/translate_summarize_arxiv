    "the interplay between disorder and superconductivity has attracted the interest of physics in the last decades .",
    "disorder is expected to compete with superconductivity by enhancing the electrical resistivity of a system . in this situation by increasing the random disorder , the system undergoes a superconductor - insulator phase transition @xcite .",
    "the theoretical explanation of the interplay between disorder and superconductivity is still a problem of intense debate for granular superconductors .",
    "several authors have proposed that high-@xmath10 superconductor are intrinsically inhomogeneous @xcite however these materials have a multiphase complexity that is difficult to tackle by analytical theoretical models in general .",
    "there is growing interest for a possible optimum inhomogeneity of superconducting cuprates that could enhance the superconducting critical temperature @xcite .",
    "the control of defects and interstitials in heterostructures using new material science technologies can be used to design new granular superconductors with new functionalities @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have provided multiscale imaging of the granular structure of doped cuprate perovskites with a scale invariance that is reflected on the scale - free distribution of oxygen interstitials @xcite .",
    "therefore it is now of high experimental interest the synthesis of novel granular superconductors made of superconducting networks with power law connectivity distribution . a road map to understand these new possible materials is to construct heterogeneous mean - field models and study the superconductor insulator phase transition in complex scale - free networks .",
    "recently the superconductor - insulator phase transition has been characterized on bethe lattices by solving the random transverse ising model on quenched bethe lattices @xcite with the use of advanced quantum cavity methods that allows to go behind the mean - field prediction .",
    "these methods have been recently developed to study exact phase diagram of the random transverse ising model @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use the quantum cavity mapping approximation of these methods , proposed in @xcite , that gives a physical interpretation of the phase diagram of the random tranverse ising model by mapping the equation determining the phase transition to a random polymer problem @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend the results to networks with arbitrary degree distribution .",
    "in particular we focus of scale - free degree distributions mimicking the fractal disorder reported in cuprates .",
    "already a mean - field calculation of the random transverse ising model on complex networks has shown that the superconducting critical temperature is strongly enhanced on scale - free degree distribution with power - law exponent @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this result might explain the experimental findings of fratini et al .",
    "@xcite and might open a new road map to design new heterogeneous superconductors with enhanced superconducting critical temperature . on the theoretical side",
    "this result is in line with the study of other phase transitions on scale - free network topologies @xcite .",
    "in fact it was shown that the classical ising model @xcite , the percolation transition@xcite the epidemic spreading @xcite change significantly when the second moment @xmath11 of the degree distribution diverges .",
    "recently it is becoming clear that these effects of the topology apply also to quantum critical phenomena @xcite and are found in the mean - field solution of both the random transverse ising model @xcite and the bose - hubbard model @xcite .",
    "an open problem , that we approach in this paper is to what extent mean - field results are indicative of the behavior of the critical phenomena in quenched networks . in",
    "particular we focus here on the random transverse ising model and we study the difference between the phase diagram on annealed and quenched scale free networks . while for annealed networks a simple mean - field results is guaranteed to be valid in quenched networks we have to approach the problem by the recently introduced quantum cavity method and by the mapping of this solution to the random polymer problem .",
    "we find that the phase diagram on annealed networks is significantly different from the phase diagram of the quenched networks as long as the second moment of the degree distribution remains finite .",
    "in particular we found a phase transition at zero temperature not predicted by the mean - field approach and a replica symmetry broken phase a low temperatures .",
    "instead , as the second moment of the degree distribution diverges @xmath12 the mean - field predictions approach the quenched solution .",
    "therefore we identify the second moment of the degree distribution as a key quantity characterizing the disorder of the topology of the network .",
    "as the second moment of the degree distribution diverges , the superconducting critical temperature of the network diverges both on quenched and on annealed complex networks .",
    "we consider a system of spin variables @xmath13 , for @xmath14 , defined on the nodes of a given network with adjacency matrix @xmath15 such that @xmath16 if there is a link between node @xmath17 and node @xmath18 otherwise @xmath19 .",
    "the random traverse ising model is defined as in @xcite and is given by the hamiltonian h=-_ija_ij^z_i ^z_j-_i _ i ^x_i - h_i _ i^z .",
    "[ h0]this hamiltonian is a simplification respect to the xy model hamiltonian proposed by ma and lee @xcite to describe the superconducting - insulator phase transition but to the leading order the equation for the order parameter is the same as widely discussed in @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian describes the superconducting - insulator phase transition as a ferromagnetic spin @xmath20 spin system in a tranverse field .",
    "we propose to use this hamiltonian to describe in a granular superconductor in network with heterogeneity of the degree distribution .",
    "the spins @xmath21 in eq .",
    "@xmath22 indicate occupied or unoccupied states by a cooper pair or a localized pair ; the parameter @xmath2 indicates the couplings between neighboring spins , @xmath23 are quenched values of on - site energy and @xmath24 is an external auxiliary field . to mimic the randomness of on - site energy",
    "we draw the variables @xmath23 from a @xmath25 distribution with a finite support @xmath26",
    ". finally in this model the superconducting phase corresponds to the existence of a spontaneous magnetization in the @xmath27 direction .",
    "we consider networks of @xmath28 nodes @xmath29 . we assign to each node",
    "@xmath17 an hidden variable @xmath30 from a @xmath31 distribution indicating the expect number of neighbors of a node .",
    "an annealed complex network is a network that is dynamically rewired and where the probability to have a link between node @xmath17 and @xmath18 is given by @xmath32 p_ij = p(a_ij=1)= [ pij2 ]    in this ensemble the degree @xmath33 of a node @xmath17 is a poisson random variable with expected degree @xmath34 .",

    "we assume that the expected degree distribution of the network is given by p()=n ^-e^-/ [ exp ] where @xmath37 is a normalization constant and @xmath38 can be modulated by an external parameter such as doping or strain in cuprates .",
    "in oder to study the random trasverse ising model on annealed complex networks we consider the fully connected hamiltonian given by = -_ijp_ij^z_i ^z_j-_i _ i ^x_i - h_i _ i^z where in order to account for the dynamics nature of the annealed graph we have substituted the adjacency matrix @xmath39 in @xmath40 with the matrix @xmath32 given by eq .",
    "in order to evaluate the partition function we apply the suzuki - trotter decomposition in a number @xmath42 of suzuki - trotter slices .",
    "therefore we have in the limit @xmath43 e^-= ( e^-/n_se^-_i _ i^x_i / n_s)^n_s where @xmath44 is given by e=-_ijp_ij^z_i ^z_j - h_i _ _ i^z . in order to perform this calculation we consider for each spin the sequence @xmath45 where each spin @xmath46 represents the spin @xmath17 in the suzuki - trotter slice @xmath47 . the partition function",

    "the order parameter for the superconducting - insulator phase transition is @xmath50 given by eq .",
    "@xmath56 . from the self - consistent equation determining the order parameter for the transition it is immediate to show that the superconducting - insulator phase transition occurs for @xmath57 at 1=j_0 ^ 1 d= which implies that for @xmath58 then @xmath59 for any fixed value of the coupling @xmath60 , and the critical temperature for the paramagnetic ferromagnetic phase transition @xmath10 diverges .",
    "this implies that on annealed scale free networks with @xmath61 and @xmath7 the random tranverse ising model is always in the superconducting phase .",

    "therefore in the annealed network model there is no phase transition at zero temperature .",
    "in fact from eq .",
    "@xmath71 when @xmath72 is finite we have that @xmath73 only for @xmath74 .",
    "this phenomena strongly depends on the assumption that the network is annealed as it was found in @xcite where the critical behavior of the random tranverse ising model was studied on a bethe lattice .",
    "the critical indices of the phase transition will be given by the heterogeneous mean - field @xcite approach to phase transition as long as the cutoff @xmath75 and will depend non - trivially from the value of the power - law exponent of the expected degree distribution @xmath6 .",
    "the critical index of the susceptibility will be the only exception and remain mean - field as long as we do nt include dependence of the network on the embedding space @xcite .",
    "in this section we introduce quenched networks that have a structure that does not change in time . in the subsequent section",
    "we will characterize the random transverse ising model on quenched networks and we compare the results with the heterogeneous mean - field results obtained in the previous sections .",
    "therefore we consider a quenched network of @xmath28 nodes @xmath76 and degree distribution @xmath77 .",
    "we indicate by @xmath78 the set of nodes neighbors of node @xmath17 .",
    "we assume that the network is random meaning that the probability to reach a node of degree @xmath4 by following a random link is given by @xmath79 .",
    "we assume that the distribution of quenched local energies @xmath23 is given by @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "we will consider in particular the case in which the degree distribution @xmath77 of the network is scale - free , with power - law exponent @xmath6 , and regularized by an exponential cutoff @xmath5 , i.e. we assume @xmath80 where @xmath37 is a normalization constant .",
    "in quenched networks critical phenomena might show a different phase diagram than on annealed networks .",
    "in particular this is true for the random transverse ising model that on quenched bethe lattices has a zero temperature phase transition which is absent on the corresponding annealed network as discussed in @xcite . in order to study critical phenomena on quenched networks with a locally tree like structure ( vanishing clustering coefficient )",
    "the theory of the cavity method has been developed and applied to a large variety of classical critical phenomena on networks .",
    "recently this approach has been extended to quantum critical phenomena without disorder using the suzuki - trotter formalism finding exact results @xcite . in this paper",
    "we take a different approach by following a recent method @xcite proposed to study the random transverse ising model on bethe lattices .",
    "this approach has the advantage that it can be applied to quantum critical phenomena with disorder and that it is analytically tractable .",
    "moreover , as we will see , the solution of the problem can be mapped to a directed polymer problem shedding light on the nature of the different phases on the critical dynamics .     for the random tranverse ising model on a complex network with power law exponent @xmath81 and different values of the cutoff @xmath5 .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the onset of the griffith ( replica - symmetry broken ) phase .",
    "this picture show that the griffith phase occupies a reduced region of phase space if the cutoff @xmath5 and the branching ratio @xmath82 diverges . ]     for the insulator - superconductor phase transition and critical value @xmath83 for the replica - symmetric and replica symmetry broken phase . for @xmath81",
    "the griffith phase occupies a reduced fraction of the phase space as the exponential cutoff @xmath5 diverges while for @xmath84 the griffith phase survives also in the @xmath64 limit . ]     when the coupling constant @xmath85 is kept constant . as @xmath67 the critical temperature for superconductivity is strongly enhanced by the scale - free topology of the underlying network . ]      in the cavity model , the cavity graphs is considered .",
    "the cavity graph is the graph centred on a node @xmath17 when one of its neighbor @xmath86 is removed .",

    "it was recently shown that the cavity - mean - field method is a very useful tool to study the random tranverse ising model @xcite .",
    "in fact on the same time it provides an analytical approach to the solution of the hamiltonian , and it provides a physical interpretation of the phenomena occurring at low temperatures . finally this approximation is able to reproduce with good accuracy the phase diagram of the random transverse ising model . in the cavity mean - field approximation",
    "we replace the dynamical spin variables @xmath90 in @xmath91 by their averages @xmath92 with values @xmath93 therefore we assume that the cavity hamiltonian acting on spin @xmath17 in absence of spin @xmath18 can be approximated by @xmath94 which implies that @xmath95 and therefore @xmath96 this recursion induces a self - consistent equation on the distribution @xmath97 of the cavity fields @xmath98 for nodes of degree @xmath4 p_k(b)&=&__k__[d b _ d _ p_k_(b _ ) ( _ ) ] + & & ( b - j_=1^k-1 ) .",
