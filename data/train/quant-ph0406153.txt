    "it is well - known that processes linear in the electromagnetic field have propagation properties that are independent of the strength of the field .",
    "this is part of the definition of linearity . in the quantum mechanical case",
    ", this is understood because the coupling between the electromagnetic field and matter is determined by the modes of the electromagnetic field independent of the state of the field , that is , independent of how the modes are populated .",
    "consequently , the question of whether an experiment can be realized at the single photon level often reduces to a detailed analysis of the experiment .",
    "an example of this is the question of whether it is possible to coherently store and retrieve light at the single photon level . in this paper , we analyze this question by studying two - photon interference in which an atomic vapor cell is placed in one arm of the interferometer and the cell operated under the conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite .    the essence of eit is to create destructive interference of the transitions for a three - level system in order to control the optical responses of the system .",
    "@xcite first suggested how eit can be used to slow the speed of light significantly compared with the vacuum case .",
    "early experiments @xcite on slow light have demonstrated that the group velocity @xmath0 can be reduced to several meters per second .",
    "the results reported in these experiments are based on the fact that eit not only makes absorption zero at the resonant situation but also leads to a rapidly changing dispersion profile .",
    "the condition for slow light propagation leads to photon switching at an energy cost of one photon per event @xcite and to efficient nonlinear processes at energies of a few photons per atomic cross section @xcite .",
    "theoretically there are two ways to implement eit .",
    "one way is adiabatic eit @xcite in which both the probe and coupling resonant lasers are adiabatically applied .",
    "after the system evolves into a steady state , eit occurs for arbitrary intensities of the probe and coupling lasers .",
    "the other way is the transient - state eit @xcite , where resonant probe and coupling lasers are simultaneously applied .",
    "eit occurs only when the intensity of the probe laser is much weaker than that of the coupling one .    in eit",
    "the system is driven by two fields called the coupling and the probe , see fig . 1 for notation .",
    "most of the early theory and experiments of eit took both coupling and probe lasers as classical external fields , see however @xcite .",
    "a disadvantage of the this approach is that it is hard to deal with atom - photon and photon - photon quantum entanglement which is of importance not only because of the interest of fundamental physics , but also for their potential applications to quantum computation and quantum communication @xcite . recently a number of papers have treated the probe laser quantum mechanically @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will take as the probe source a photon produced using spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) @xcite . in this nonlinear optical process a high - frequency photon is annihilated and two lower frequency photons , conventionally referred to as the signal and idler , are generated .",
    "the pair of photons are entangled in frequency and wave number .",
    "the correlations of the entangled two - photon system can be measured by means of coincidence counting detection .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the optical properties of a transient - state eit system interacting with one quantized field and investigate the response of the eit medium to the nonclassical light field .",
    "we determine the two - photon interference in which one of the photons is stored and released .",
    "we want to examine whether the two - photon entangled state can be preserved in the process .",
    "there is an inherent mismatch of four orders of magnitude between the spectral bandwidth of spdc and very narrow bandwidth of eit ; however , we shall see that it still may be possible to perform a proof of principle experiment .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the quantum mechanical description of the system hamiltonian .",
    "the equations of motion for the quantum probe field is given . in sec .",
    "iii , we investigate the optical properties of the eit system related to the proposed experiment . in sec .",
    "iv , the two - photon interference experiment of the correlated photon pairs generated by spdc will be discussed when the signal photon is delayed in an eit system . finally , we summarize our results in sec",
    "to describe the interaction of electromagnetic fields , the standard method is to start with the bloch equations for the atomic density - matrix elements under the adiabatic assumption and moderate intensities of the fields .",
