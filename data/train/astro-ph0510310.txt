    "pulsar magnetospheres are complicated electrodynamic systems that involve the acceleration of charged particles by the rotationally induced electric field , the electron - positron pair production , and the bulk outflow of magnetospheric plasma through the light cylinder .",
    "the pair production presumably occurs on the scale which is significantly smaller compared to the magnetospheric scale ( the last is determined by the light cylinder radius @xmath0 ) .",
    "this suggests that that the global structure of pulsar magnetospheres may not depend on the details of the pair production mechanism which may enter the problem only in the form of boundary conditions .",
    "the simplest assumption is that the plasma supply is sufficiently plentiful to allow the mhd description throughout the whole magnetosphere .",
    "although this may be not so in the case of slowly rotating or weakly magnetized pulsars @xcite , it still makes sense to regard the mhd solution as a zero approximation model and a good reference point .",
    "although pulsar magnetospheres are generically three dimensional it is still reasonable to start with a much simpler axisymmetric case as it involves most of the basic physical elements of the general case .",
    "michel and scharlemann & wagoner   first analysed the structure of the stationary axisymmetric pulsar magnetosphere in the limit of force - free electrodynamics where both the pressure and inertia of magnetospheric plasma are assumed to be vanishingly small .",
    "they found that in this case the problem is reduced to the following second order pde that is now called the pulsar equation , @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the cylindrical coordinates normalised to the radius of the light cylinder and @xmath4 is the magnetic flux function .",
    "this equation also involves the poloidal current function , @xmath5 , that is unknown .",
    "if this function is somehow specified the pulsar equation become a linear elliptic equation . however , the question of what actually determines the electric current function is not that obvious and is still debated @xcite .",
    "the physical meaning of these functions is quite simple : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the magnetic flux through the axisymmetric circular loop given by @xmath8const , @xmath9const ; @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the total electric current flowing through the same loop .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that if we set @xmath12 then @xmath13 and that in a steady - state @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the covariant azimuthal components of the vector - potential @xmath17 and the magnetic field @xmath18 in the non - normalised basis of cylindrical or spherical coordinates .",
    "another important feature of this equation is the mathematical singularity at the light cylinder .",
    "it was argued by ingraham that the condition of smooth passage through this surface together with the appropriate boundary conditions determine the unique electric current function of the pulsar equation ( this property makes the problem somewhat similar to the classical eigenvalue problem in the theory of differential equations . ) ingraham even proposed an iterative algorithm for finding this function . in the same year",
    "michel did actually find an exact solution to the pulsar equation in the case of split - monopole magnetic field that passed through the singular surface both continuously and smoothly .",
    "although michel did not use ingraham s approach his result supported ingraham s idea and raised expectations for finding smooth continuous solutions in more complicated realistic cases , like for example the magnetosphere of a rotating dipole , as well .",
    "( the recent observations of magnetospheric eclipses in the binary pulsar j0737 - 3039 have confirmed that the dipolar model may indeed be quite accurate @xcite . )    the electric current of michel s solution has the same sign within the magnetosphere with the exception of the equatorial current sheet that provides current closure . further analysis by ingraham and michel suggested that if the force - free solution for an axisymmetric rotating dipole existed then far beyond the light cylinder it should still closely resemble the split - monopole one .",
    "however , in the near zone the structure of the dipole magnetosphere was expected to be qualitatively different . indeed ,",
    "close to the star the effects of its rotation are relatively small and so must be the difference between the solutions for the rotating and the non - rotating magnetospheres . as the result , the so - called `` dead zone '' should exist where the magnetic field lines remain closed and the magnetospheric plasma co - rotates with the star .",
    "however , the problem of finding the self - consistent global solution for dipolar magnetospheres turned out to be rather involved , even for the axisymmetric case of aligned rotator . for a very long time",
    ", the only attempts to construct such solutions involved utilisation of prescribed electric current functions . such solutions would either exhibit kinks at the light cylinder or violate the conditions of force - free approximation at some relatively short distance from it , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the break through came only recently then contopoulos et al .",
    "( 1999 , hereafter ckf ) have finally managed to solve the problem numerically . in this solution",
    "the dead zone continues all the way to the light cylinder where the so - called `` y - point '' appears in the magnetic field structure whereas beyond the light cylinder it has the same topology as the split - monopole solution including an infinitely thin equatorial current sheet .",
    "the return current of the equatorial current sheet splits at the y - point into two currents sheets that flow along the surface separating the dead zone from the open field zone .",
    "an additional finite width layer of return current exists just outside of the dead zone and around the equatorial plane .",
    "uzdensky carried out asymptotic analysis of the force - free solutions in vicinity of the y - point .",
    "it has turned out that in the presents of separating current sheets , similar to those found in @xcite , the electromagnetic field becomes infinitely strong at the y - point .",
    "he argued that this is unphysical and questioned correctness of the ckf - solution .",
    "as an alternative uzdensky considered the case with no current sheets , that is the case where the electric current returns within the equatorial layer of the open field zone only . in this case",
    "the electromagnetic field does not diverge at the y - point but just outside of this point the electric field becomes stronger than the magnetic field signaling a breakdown of the force - free approximation .",
    "no such complications were found for the y - point located inside the light cylinder .",
    "in fact , in this case the separating surface crosses the equator at the right angle so that the y - point turns into a `` t - point '' .",
    "gruzinov also analysed the force - free solution in the vicinity of the y - point located at the light cylinder in the presence of the current sheets and confirmed that in this case the electromagnetic field diverges at the y - point .",
    "his analytical solution exhibits the angle of @xmath19 between the equatorial plane and the separating surface at the y - point . in order to verify this he repeated the ckf - calculations with much higher spatial resolution and the results seemed to confirm the development of a singularity with the expected inclination angle of separatrices .",
    "the next potentially very important step was made by goodwin et al .",
    "who realised that the dead zone does not have to extend all the way to the light cylinder but can be much smaller .",
    "such solutions select their own electric current functions , smaller dead zones corresponding to weaker currents .",
    "in fact , the first solutions of the pulsar equation which described both the equatorial current sheet and the dead zones that were located deep inside the light cylinder were found by lyubarskii .",
    "however , these solutions utilized a prescribed electric current function and , as the result , exhibited the breakdown of the force - free approximation  at a certain distance from the light cylinder the electric field became stronger than the magnetic field .",
    "goodwin et al . also included finite gas pressure inside the dead zone and showed that this allows solutions that remain nonsingular at the y - point even when this point is located on the light cylinder . in this case",
    "their solution gives the inclination angle of the y - point of @xmath20 .",
    "however , the inertia associated with the gas pressure has not been taken into account and thus the self - consistency of such approach is questionable .",
    "this idea of goodwin et al .",
    "was further explored by timokhin who has constructed numerical solutions for force - free magnetospheres with the y - point located within the light cylinder ( with no finite gas pressure in the dead zone ) .",
    "he also pointed out that the pulsar spin - down rate depended not only on the size the light cylinder but also on the size of the dead zone and if the ratio of these scales were to evolve with the pulsar age then this could explain why the observed braking index of pulsars is smaller than the one derived from the models with the dead zone extending all the way up to the light cylinder .",
    "another interesting twist has been added by contopoulos , who argued that during the pulsar evolution the potential gap separating the star surface from the polar cap magnetosphere grows in magnitude leading to a slower rotation of the open field lines compared to the star and the dead zone .",
    "in such a case , there is no a single light cylinder for the whole magnetosphere .",
    "instead , the dead zone has its own light cylinder that is located inside the light cylinder of the polar cap . to illustrate this point contopoulos(2005 )",
    "constructed a set of numerical models of pulsar magnetospheres of this kind .",
    "the evolution of the angular velocity of the polar cap magnetosphere with pulsar age may also result in the lower values of the pulsar s braking index .    in spite of this remarkable progress the method of pulsar equation",
    "has its obvious limitations .",
    "it does not address the question of stability of the steady - state solutions and it does not allow to study possible non - stationary phenomena in pulsar magnetospheres .",
    "moreover , the numerical techniques that have been used to solve the pulsar equation may turn up to be rather difficult to adapt to the fully 3-dimensional problem of the oblique rotator . the obvious way of approaching these problem is to relax the stationarity condition and to solve the original system of time - dependent equations .",
    "although the force - free electrodynamics was used to model various astrophysical systems since 1970s the focus was entirely on the steady - state equations .",
    "only recently , the time - dependent equations have been subjected to a systematic study @xcite . as the result",
    "it has been found that they form a simple hyperbolic system of conservations laws in many respects similar to relativistic mhd but only with the fast and the alfvn hyperbolic waves @xcite .",
    "thus , a variety of standard numerical methods can be used to deal with these equations .",
    "the very first numerical simulations of this kind , of the monopole magnetospheres of black holes , seemed to confirm the suitability of this approach @xcite .",
    "however , further applications to somewhat more complex magnetic configurations revealed its limitations as the force - free approximation would often break down following development of strong current sheets @xcite .",
    "these results suggested to look for a more general mathematical framework that would allow to handle current sheets via introducing new channels of back reaction of plasma on the electromagnetic field .",
    "one of the most suitable options is the framework of resistive relativistic mhd .",
    "however , this approach remains rather poorly studied even now .",
    "ideal relativistic mhd is a somewhat easier option and thanks to the recent effort by several groups , a significant expertise has been obtained in developing numerical methods for this system .",
    "this approach allows to take into account both the thermodynamic pressure of plasma heated in the current sheets but the dissipation of electromagnetic energy is entirely due to numerical resistivity that is not fully satisfactory .",
    "another alternative is resistive force - free electrodynamics with physical or artificial resistivity .",
    "if the current sheets of pulsar magnetospheres are indeed dissipationless then this approach might work provided that the utilized ohm law allows evolution towards a dissipationless force - free state .",
    "the recent time - dependent simulations by a.spitkovsky show that this approach may indeed be quite productive ( the results were presented last summer at the conference on `` physics of astrophysical outflows and accretion disks '' , kitp , santa - barbara , 2005 . )    in this paper we report the results of new time - dependent axisymmetric simulations of rotating dipole magnetospheres of neutron stars within the frameworks of resistive force - free electrodynamics and ideal relativistic mhd .",
    "we only consider the case where the whole magnetosphere rotates with the same angular velocity and thus our results are not relevant to the model of contopoulos .",
    "this model will be a subject of a separate study .",
    "note , that throughout the paper the graphic data are shown in the dimensionless units where the magnetic dipole moment @xmath21 , the angular velocity of the star @xmath22 , and the speed of light @xmath23 .",
    "hence the cylindrical radius of the light cylinder @xmath24 .",
    "using the standard notation of the 3 + 1 approach the metric form of a general space - time can be written as    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the metric tensor of `` the absolute space '' , @xmath27 is the lapse function , and @xmath28 is the shift vector . for most purposes in physics of pulsar magnetospheres the flat space approximation suffices and one can enjoy the benefits of a global inertial frame where @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( see however beskin 1990 and muslimov & tsygan 1990 ) .",
    "this is exactly what was adopted in the numerical models of pulsar magnetospheres described in the introduction and in this study as well .",
    "however , the computer codes used in the simulations are designed to work with a rather general axisymmetric and stationary space - times . moreover , in the case of oblique rotator the frame rotating with the star seem to be more suitable as the solution may become stationary in this frame . in such a case @xmath28 is no longer vanishing and in the basis of spherical spacial coordinates @xmath31 and hence @xmath32 where @xmath22 is the angular velocity of the frame .    in our simulations ,",
    "the computational grid covers the axisymmetric domain @xmath33\\times[0,\\pi]$ ] so no symmetry condition is enforced at the equatorial plane .",
    "the cell size in the @xmath34-direction is such that the corresponding physical lengths in both directions are equal , @xmath35 . the `` radiative '' outer boundary , @xmath36 , is always located so far away from the star that the light signal does not cross the computational domain by the end of the simulations  this ensures that waves produced near the star do not get reflected of the outer boundary at any rate .",
    "as the courant stability condition requires @xmath37 , the suitable time step for the outer part of the computational domain is much larger than the one for its inner part .",
    "this allows us to reduce the computational cost of simulations via splitting the computational domain into a set of rings such that the outer radius of each ring is twice its inner radius and advance the solution for each @xmath38th ring with it its own time step , @xmath39 , such that @xmath40 .",
    "thus , one integration step of ring @xmath38 corresponds to two integration steps of ring @xmath41 , four integration steps of ring @xmath42 and so on . as the result , the outer regions of the computational domain are progressively less expensive in terms of cpu time .",
    "this approach has already been successfully applied in recent mhd simulations of pulsar wind nebulae @xcite .",
    "the initial solution describes a nonrotating magnetosphere with exactly dipolar magnetic field , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the magnetic dipole moment . at time @xmath45 the stellar rotation is suddenly switched on via an appropriate inner boundary condition .",
    "the simulations are then proceeded till it becomes clear whether the time - dependent solution relaxes to a steady state on scales comparable with the light cylinder radius or not .",
    "steady - state solutions that are found in such a way are automatically stable to axisymmetric perturbations with wave - lengths exceeding the cell size .",
    "following komissarov we write vacuum maxwell s equations as    @xmath46    @xmath47    @xmath48    @xmath49    here @xmath50 is the determinant of the metric tensor of the absolute space , @xmath51 is the levi - civita tensor of the absolute space ( @xmath52 for right - handed systems and @xmath53 for left - handed ones . )",
    "the electric field , @xmath54 , and the magnetic field , @xmath55 , are defined via @xmath56 and @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the faraday tensor of the electromagnetic field , which is simply dual to the maxwell tensor @xmath59 :    @xmath60    where    @xmath61    is the levi - civita alternating tensor of spacetime .",
    "the differential equations ( [ divb]-[ampere ] ) are supplemented with the following constitutive equations @xcite :    @xmath62    @xmath63    @xmath64    note , that 1 ) the components of all vectors and tensors appearing in these equations are measured in the non - normalised coordinate basis , @xmath65 , of spacial coordinates ; 2 ) @xmath66 , @xmath55 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 are the electric field , the magnetic field , the electric current density , and the electric charge density as measured by a local observer at rest in the absolute space .",
    "the 4-velocity of this observer is @xmath69 in the inertial frames of flat spacetime @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the final equation that is needed to close the system is the ohm law . in strongly magnetized plasma",
    "the conductivity is no longer isotropic and under rather general conditions    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the drift current .",
    "unless the magnetosphere has scarce supply of electrically charged particles , `` charge starved '' , the parallel conductivity is very larger that leads to small residual parallel component of electric field , @xmath74 however , the strong magnetic field of pulsar magnetospheres effectively suppresses conductivity across the magnetic field lines ( unless the electric field is even stronger than the magnetic one ; this may be the case inside some current sheets . )",
    "so we can put    @xmath75    as shown in @xcite , in this limit we approach the approximation of force - free electrodynamics .    within current sheets this simple prescription is unlikely to hold . on one hand , in the area of high current density one may expect strong anomalous resistivity leading to significantly reduced @xmath76 . as the result , the current sheet may become unstable to the tearing mode of reconnection @xcite . since our intention at this point is merely to see",
    "if we can construct idealized numerical solutions that are more - or - less force - free and thus can be compared with the steady state solutions of the pulsar equation we will ignore this physical effect for the time being . on the other hand , the mere symmetry of the aligned rotator magnetosphere suggests that sooner or later the magnetic field of force - free solution will become very small in the equatorial plane beyond the light cylinder , thus leading to unavoidable breakdown of the @xmath77 condition of the force - free approximation .",
    "in such a case of relatively weak magnetic field the conductivity is expected to become much less anisotropic and we will assume that    @xmath78    notice , that the expression ( [ jdrift ] ) for the drift current should also be modified in this case as it implies that the drift speed @xmath79 becomes higher then the speed of light .",
    "we have tried several modifications for the @xmath80 including @xmath81 which is likely to underestimate @xmath80 in the current sheet and @xmath82 which certainly overestimates it .",
    "the actual value of conductivity in the current current sheet remain a free parameter .",
    "to find numerical solutions of maxwell s equation , in particular the solutions that are presented in the next section , we used the godunov - type numerical scheme described in komissarov .",
    "the most striking and at first somewhat perplexing result of our electrodynamic simulations of pulsar magnetospheres is demonstrated in figure  [ ffde ]  contrary to what is found in the steady - state solutions of the pulsar equation the magnetic field lines remain close even outside of the light cylinder .",
    "moreover , the solution seems to be rather insensitive to the details of the model for @xmath83 and remains qualitatively the same even in the case @xmath84 ( in fact , the solutions exhibited convergence in the limit @xmath85 . )    the question of whether the field lines extending beyond the light cylinder should open up or not is in fact rather involved . one of the arguments often put forward in its discussion concerns the requirement for the speed of charged particles that fill the magnetosphere to remain smaller than the speed of light .",
    "in the drift approximation the charged particles move along the rotating magnetic field lines like beads on wire  their motion is a composition of the rotational motion of the field line ( the `` wire '' ) and the sliding motion of the particle ( the `` bead '' ) along the field line . within the light cylinder",
    "the speed of the rotational motion is less than the speed of light and the bead does not have to slide along the wire , but this is no longer the case beyond the light cylinder . here the total speed of the bead can remain less than @xmath86 only if it also slides along the wire and only if the wire is twisted in the azimuthal direction ( in such a case the sliding motion may help to reduce the azimuthal component of the bead velocity . )",
    "these conditions may well be satisfied everywhere along the open field lines but not along the closed ones .",
    "indeed , such field lines can not have an azimuthal component in the equatorial plane because of the symmetries of the problem .",
    "thus , one may expect spinning up of the charged particles till their inertia becomes important and the centrifugal force opens up the closed field lines .",
    "on the other hand , the drift approximation itself may breakdown and the charges may start moving across the magnetic field well before their inertia becomes dynamical significant .",
    "one can look at this breakdown of the drift approximation from another prospective . beyond the light cylinder the electric field of a force - free solution becomes stronger than the poloidal component of the magnetic field and thus stronger than the total magnetic field in regions where the azimuthal component of magnetic field vanishes .",
    "such a strong electric field is capable of `` tearing '' charged particle off the magnetic field lines and driving strong electric current across the magnetic field .",
    "this is a micro - physical argument but there is an equally compelling macroscopic one .",
    "full opening of magnetic field lines implies an infinitely thin equatorial current sheet with an infinitely high electric current density .",
    "even very small but finite resistivity will destroy this ideal configuration and result in a steady - state current layer of finite thickness and closure of some of the magnetic field lines in this layer .",
    "thus , the only meaningful question is how many field lines will be closed in this layer .    in order to explain the remarkable indifference of our solutions to the the value of @xmath83 it is instructive to consider a much simpler problem of a one dimensional current sheet .",
    "here we adopt an inertial frame with cartesian coordinates so that ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) .",
    "assuming that @xmath89 and @xmath90 and using the following model for the cross - field conductivity @xmath91 we find the following solution @xmath92 @xmath93 this solution exhibits a number of interesting features .",
    "first of all it is stationary .",
    "secondly , the magnitude of @xmath94 effects only the width of the current sheet .",
    "this may explain the observed convergence of the magnetospheric solutions in the limit @xmath95 .",
    "finally , the electromagnetic energy flows into the current sheet with the speed of light and disappears inside of it .",
    "this property clearly exposes the nature of ohm s law ( [ ohm ] ) with prescription ( [ sigma - perp ] ) or similar and outlines the limitations of its applicability .",
    "indeed , in real plasma the ohmic dissipation would cause strong heating and increase of the gas pressure in the current sheet .",
    "this pressure would slow down the inflow of plasma into the current sheet and significantly modify its structure .",
    "however , this factor , as well as the plasma inertia , are completely ignored in our version of ohm s law .    the fact that our numerical magnetospheric solution remains qualitatively the same even in the limit @xmath96 suggests that the numerical resistivity of our scheme takes over in this limit .",
    "different numerical schemes have different dissipative properties and this may explain why the recent electrodynamic simulations of spitkovsky ( which have been presented at various astrophysical meetings ) exhibit opening up of the field lines beyond the light cylinder and development of the dissipationless equatorial current sheet .    the properties of the current sheets of real pulsars are determined by a number of competing micro - physical processes that might be rather difficult to account for in a macroscopic model . our experiments with the simplistic generalised ohm law ( [ ohm][vdrift1 ] ) show that it facilitates development of strongly dissipative current sheets .",
    "since the dissipated energy of the electromagnetic field is not stored in any dynamical component and simply vanishes from the system this model could only be relevant for magnetospheres with effective radiative cooling .",
    "the strong gamma - ray emission from some pulsars may be interpreted as an indication of strong radiative current sheets ( see the discussion ) .",
    "unfortunately , such emission is not a common feature of pulsars .",
    "the difficulties that we have encountered in dealing with current sheets in force - free electrodynamics have forced us to return to the framework of full relativistic mhd even if the pulsar magnetospheres are expected to be magnetically dominated everywhere else and in spite of the fact that the system of mhd equations becomes stiff in this regime .",
    "the mhd approximation takes into account not only the gas pressure but also its inertia which may become important both far away from the star , in the wind zone , and near the light cylinder .",
    "ideally we should also incorporate a physical model for electric resistivity which would allow us to conduct a proper study of the dissipation within the equatorial current sheet but it makes perfect sense to start with the simpler framework of ideal mhd .",
    "the system of ideal relativistic mhd includes the continuity equation @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the rest mass density of matter and @xmath99 is its 4-velocity ; the energy - momentum equations    @xmath100    where @xmath101 is the total stress - energy - momentum tensor ; the induction equation , @xmath102 and the divergence free condition    @xmath103    the total stress - energy - momentum tensor , @xmath104 , is a sum of the stress - energy momentum tensor of matter @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the thermodynamic pressure and @xmath107 is the enthalpy per unit volume , and the stress - energy momentum tensor of the electromagnetic field @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the maxwell tensor of the electromagnetic field . in the limit of ideal mhd @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the usual 3-velocity of plasma .",
    "the mhd simulations were carried out using a godunov - type scheme that is described in komissarov .",
    "however , we had to introduce a number of additional features in order to overcome a number of challenging problems specific to the case of highly - magnetized plasma .",
    "the mhd equations become stiff in magnetically dominated domains and this is exactly the case for the main volume of pulsar magnetospheres where the energy density of matter is many orders of magnitude less than the one of the electromagnetic field .",
    "there is no hope of reaching such conditions with our numerical method .",
    "however , the electromagnetic part of the mhd solution should not be very different even when the energy ratio is artificially increased up to 0.1 - 0.01  errors of order of few percent are quite acceptable at this stage of investigation .",
    "in fact , the results of force - free and mhd simulations of the monopole magnetospheres of black holes strongly support this conclusion @xcite . in those mhd simulations ,",
    "additional plasma was pumped in the regions where its energy density had reached a certain lower limit . here , we apply a similar trick .",
    "the actual condition is @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the lorentz factor of plasma and @xmath114 is a small constant ( we used @xmath115 . )",
    "when this condition is broken we increase both @xmath98 and @xmath106 in the same proportion so that @xmath116 .    however , the dipolar magnetospheres are more challenging compared to the monopole ones because of the faster decline of magnetic field strength with the distance from the star and the existence of dead zones . within the dead zones",
    "the magnetospheric plasma is supposed to be in static equilibrium .",
    "thus , the component of the centrifugal force acting along the magnetic field lines has to be balanced by some other force .",
    "it has been argued that the dead zone plasma is charge - separated and the force balance is achieved by means of a small parallel component of electric field ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however the recent eclipse observations of the binary pulsar jo737 - 3039 allowed direct measurement of the particle density in the dead zone of one of the components @xcite . it has turned out to be many orders of magnitude higher than the expected density of the charged - separated plasma .",
    "whether such a high density is specific for binary systems only , as proposed in @xcite , or typical for single pulsars as well remains to be seen . in any case , the charge - separated dead - zones can not be modelled within the mhd approximation where the required force balance can only be achieved by means of gas pressure .",
    "this would require the gas pressure to increase along the magnetic field line and reach a maximum in the equatorial plane .",
    "on the contrary , the magnetic pressure of dipolar magnetosphere decreases with distance as @xmath117 and thus the ratio of magnetic to gas pressure has to decline even faster than @xmath117 .",
    "given the requirement on the dead zone to remain magnetically dominated everywhere this implies very high pressure ratio near the star surface - much higher than our numerical scheme can accommodate . to overcome this problem one could consider the case where the star radius is only 2 - 3 times smaller than the radius of its light cylinder but this would have a rather strong effect on the structure of the magnetosphere",
    "this is why we have preferred a different strategy .",
    "its idea is to reduce , somewhat arbitrarily , the dynamical effect of the centrifugal force on the motion of plasma near the star so that it does not destroy the nearly force - free equilibrium across the magnetic field lines within the dead zone .",
    "one way of achieving this is to reset the gas pressure and its rest mass density to some rather low target values , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , within the dead zone every time step . at the same time",
    "one may reset the flow speed along the magnetic field lines to zero , just as it should be in equilibrium .",
    "however , the dead zone is not a well defined region in the case of time - dependent magnetospheres .",
    "instead , one could apply the same procedure to a volume that is guaranteed to include if not the whole dead zone then at least its inner part .",
    "for example , we used a sphere of radius @xmath120 .",
    "this however leads to another complication  in the open field region bounded by the sphere there emerges a strong rarefaction wave , so strong that the code crashes .",
    "fortunately , this can be avoided if instead of resetting the target values one introduces a relaxation towards them with the relaxation time gradually increasing towards the boundary of the relaxation domain .",
    "we evolved @xmath106 , @xmath98 , and @xmath121 according to the following equations    @xmath122    @xmath123    @xmath124    where @xmath125 @xmath126 @xmath127 where @xmath128 is constant , and @xmath129 is the star radius .",
    "as one can see , the relaxation time becomes infinite at @xmath130 .",
    "the results presented below correspond to @xmath131 .",
    "however , we have also tried smaller values of @xmath132 in order to verify that this does not lead to qualitatively different results ( we discuss the effects of reducing @xmath132 in section 5 . ) the dependence of @xmath133 on the azimuthal angle was introduce in order to reduce the possible adverse effect on the current sheet should it be formed inside the light cylinder .",
    "the actual value of @xmath128 is to be found by the method of trial and error . finally , we use the following targets for the pressure and density    @xmath134    where @xmath115 and @xmath135 .    in these simulations ,",
    "the computational grid covered the axisymmetric domain @xmath136\\times[0,\\pi]$ ] and hence the star radius was set to @xmath137 . in order to speed up the calculation we started with a relatively low resolution grid , @xmath138 , and then increased the resolution twice after the solution seemed to have reached a steady - state on the scale of several @xmath139 .",
    "hence the final grid had @xmath140 cells .",
    "the initial solution described a non - rotating magnetosphere with dipolar magnetic field , eq.([dipole ] ) , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 . at @xmath45",
    "the star rotation is switched on and a torsional alfvn wave is emitted from its surface . as it propagates away larger and larger portion of the magnetosphere",
    "is set into rotation and develops an electric current system .",
    "this process is illustrated in figure [ glob ] where the contours show the magnetic field lines and the colour image shows the distribution of @xmath144 , where i is the total electric current and @xmath145 is the total displacement current through the circular contour of cylindrical radius @xmath146 .",
    "unity corresponds to @xmath147 .    behind the wave the solution gradually approaches a steady state .",
    "figure [ inner ] shows the inner region of this steady state solution at @xmath148 , the termination time of the simulations .",
    "the structure of magnetic field lines suggests that the dead zone extends all the way up to the light cylinder . beyond the light cylinder",
    "the poloidal magnetic field becomes radial , as expected @xcite .",
    "some magnetic field lines are closing up beyond the light cylinder but they do so within the equatorial current sheet due to finite artificial resistivity in the numerical scheme  it is easy to see the transition between the dead zone and the current sheet within which the magnetic field lines are highly stretched in the radial direction . the colour image in the top left panel of this figure shows the distribution of @xmath16 . since in a steady state the displacement current vanishes we have @xmath149 this image confirms our conclusion on the extension of the dead zone which is seen in the image as a toroidal structure with @xmath150 ( indeed , within the dead zone the poloidal currents do not flow and @xmath16 must be zero . ) the jumps in @xmath16 occurring at the boundary of the dead zone and along the equator are indicators of thin sheets of return current .",
    "this image also shows , though not as clear , that @xmath16 and hence @xmath151 reach maximum amplitude at some finite distance from the equatorial plane .",
    "this indicates the presence of an additional layer of return current that surrounds the equatorial current sheet and the dead zone @xcite .",
    "the current sheets are most prominent in the right panel of figure  [ inner ] that shows the distribution the poloidal current density , @xmath152 , multiplied by @xmath153 .",
    "one can also see that the thickness of the current sheets near the y - point is about @xmath154 and that equatorial current sheet extends inside the light cylinder by approximately the same distance .    from time to time",
    "it was suggested that particle inertia may actually become dynamically important near the light cylinder , thus rendering the force - free approximation as unsuitable .",
    "the argument develops like this . provided the magnetospheric plasma",
    "simply co - rotated with the star its speed would exceed the speed of light beyond the light cylinder .",
    "this does not occur because of the rapidly increasing inertial mass of this plasma near the light cylinder .",
    "this leads to very strong centrifugal force that makes the plasma to flow across the light cylinder thus opening up the magnetic field lines and sweeping them back .",
    "however , this not what occurs in our simulations .",
    "indeed , the top left panel of figure  [ inner ] shows that , very much in agreement with the force - free models , @xmath16 is constant along the magnetic flux surfaces even when they cross the light cylinder .",
    "moreover , this conclusion is fully supported by the data presented in the bottom left panel of figure  [ inner ] that shows that the distribution of @xmath155 , the quantity that can be used to describe the relative importance of the inertial effects as well as of the gas pressure .",
    "one can see that it remains very low everywhere outside of the equatorial current sheet including the light cylinder .",
    "there is , however , one location in the force - free solution of contopoulos et al . where the inertial effects are expected to become important .",
    "it is the so - called y - point , that is the point where the dead zone approaches the light cylinder . indeed , since the dead zone co - rotates with the star then plasma particles attached to its field lines rotate with the speed reaching the speed of light at the y - point .",
    "moreover , one may argue that the divergence of magnetic field strength at the y - point discovered by gruzinov also suggests a breakdown of the force - free approximation .",
    "this fully agrees with the data presented in the bottom right panel of figure  [ inner ] which shows the distribution of @xmath156 in our mhd solution .",
    "although the plot shows a local minimum at @xmath157 and then some growth of @xmath156 in the direction of the y - point this growth never develops .",
    "moreover , in our solution the poloidal magnetic field lines approach the y - point at an angle of @xmath158 to the equatorial plane ( see fig.[inner ] ) , which is significantly lower than @xmath19 predicted by gruzinov and quite close to the value of @xmath159 found in goodwin et al .. in addition to the inertial effects , the relatively high thickness of the current sheets near the y - point ( the right top panel of figure  [ inner ] ) and finite gas pressure also contribute to these discrepancies between our simulations and the force - free solution .",
    "our results however do not prove that the asymptotic force - free solution for the y - point is irrelevant .",
    "it seems possible that for sufficiently high magnetization and small resistivity the exact mhd solution will first approach the force - free asymptote found by gruzinov and then deviate from it on smaller scales .",
    "this , however , requires further investigation .",
    "figure [ current1.2 ] shows @xmath16 as a function of @xmath4 at @xmath160 and allows us to see these details of the current system more clearly .",
    "this distribution is very similar to the one given in figure 4 of contopoulos et al .",
    "the minimum has @xmath161    the left panel of figure [ fluxes ] shows the distribution of magnetic flux function @xmath4 in the equatorial plane of the final solution . as a consequence of the finite artificial resistivity in our numerical scheme",
    "the magnetic field lines continue to close up even beyond the line cylinder and this shows itself via a systematic decline of @xmath4 at @xmath162 .",
    "thus , it is not so straightforward to determine the fraction of opened field lines in this solution .",
    "one way to describe it quantitatively is by giving the value of the flux function exactly at @xmath163 .",
    "this gives us @xmath164 on the other hand , figure  [ fluxes ] shows that the decline of @xmath165 significantly slows down at @xmath166 where @xmath165 reaches the value of @xmath167 these numbers should be compared with the @xmath168 in contopoulos and timokhin , @xmath169 in gruzinov , and @xmath170 in contopoulos et al ..    the right panel of figure [ fluxes ] shows the total flux of energy through the sphere of radius @xmath34 that should be constant in a steady state solution .",
    "one can see that it is indeed more or less constant with the exception of @xmath171 where the energy flux slightly increases .",
    "this increase is a permanent feature that arises because our scheme is not strictly conservative . in order to evaluate the spin - down power of the star we used the energy flux through the sphere of radius @xmath172 , thus ignoring the non - physical increase of total luminosity beyond @xmath172",
    "this gives us @xmath173 which is in a very good agreement with the result by gruzinov(2005 ) .",
    "figure [ omega ] shows the distribution of the angular velocity of magnetic field lines , @xmath174 . in the exact steady - state force - free solution",
    "the magnetic field lines rotate with same angular velocity as the star , @xmath175 however in our solution , @xmath174 noticeably deviates from @xmath22 inside the layer coincident with the current sheet between the open field lines and the dead zone ( see fig.[omega ] ) .",
    "the most likely reason for this is the enhanced numerical resistivity in the current sheet .",
    "the comparison of solutions with different numerical resolution ( fig.[omega ] ) shows that the thickness of the layer significantly decreases with resolution .",
    "however , the amplitude of the perturbations does not seem to depend on the resolution .",
    "figure  [ monop ] shows that far away from the star the distribution of poloidal field lines is very similar to the split - monopole one .",
    "this is exactly what was concluded in the pioneering papers by ingraham and michel on the force - free magnetospheres .",
    "more recently , the centrifugally driven outflows in split - monopole magnetospheres have been studied within the cold - mhd approximation . according to these studies the lorentz factor of centrifugally accelerated plasma at the fast critical point is @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the so - called magnetization parameter which is defined as the ratio of the poynting flux density to the rest mass - energy flux density at the foot point of the magnetic field line @xcite . for outflows that are initially poynting dominated @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the ratio of the total energy flux density to the rest mass - energy flux density . in contrast to @xmath177 , @xmath179",
    "can be measured at every point of the field line as it is constant along it .",
    "figure  [ fast ] shows the distribution of @xmath179 , @xmath113 , and the ingoing speed of the fast wave in the radial direction along the ray @xmath180rad . from these data we find that along this ray @xmath181 and the fast point is located at @xmath182 where @xmath183 . on the other hand",
    ", we can use the above value of @xmath177 in order to calculate the lorentz factor at the fast point directly from eq .",
    "[ beskin ]  this give us @xmath184 .",
    "thus , the split - monopole model provides quite a good model for the wind zone of aligned magnetic dipole .",
    "another interesting feature of figure  [ monop ] is the significantly higher value of the lorentz factor of the outflow within the equatorial current sheet .",
    "this suggests that the mechanism of the flow acceleration is somewhat different there .",
    "the obvious suspect is heating due to resistive dissipation of the electromagnetic energy .",
    "the high value of lorentz factor in the current sheet suggests that its contribution into the global energy transfer can be quite significant .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ convert ] shows the evolution of the wind luminosities with the distance from the star by the end of simulations .",
    "the total luminosity is more or less constant apart from noticeable perturbations around @xmath185 , @xmath186 , and @xmath187 .",
    "the big bump around @xmath187 is related to the leading front of the wind .",
    "the perturbations around @xmath185 and @xmath186 are related to the grid refinement events  each time the computational grid is refined the numerical solution evolves to a slightly different state , most of all in the inner region of the computational domain .",
    "this triggers noticeable waves propagating away from the star .",
    "the electromagnetic luminosity , which is shown in figure  [ convert ] by the dashed line , gradually decreases with distance thus indicating the ongoing conversion of the electromagnetic energy into the hydrodynamic energy .",
    "this is supported by the evolution of the hydrodynamic luminosity of the wind which is shown by the dash - dotted line .",
    "one of the interesting feature of this line is its rapid rise initial rise that suggests a particularly effective energy conversion .",
    "the nature of this conversion is clarified in the right panel of figure  [ convert ] that shows that the current sheet accounts for about 70% of the total hydrodynamic luminosity at @xmath188 and this corresponds to about 15% of the total wind luminosity .",
    "this clearly points out at the ohmic heating in the current sheet as the main source of the energy conversion .",
    "there is not much to discuss in connection with our force - free simulations of pulsar magnetospheres .",
    "we simply have not been able to make the required progress using this framework because of the inability to handle the equatorial current sheet . for this reason we will focus in this section almost entirely on the results of our mhd simulations and their possible implication for pulsar physics .",
    "one of the key goals of this study was to determine there the mhd equations allow stable , or quasi - stable , steady - state solutions for dipolar axisymmetric magnetospheres of neutron stars .",
    "this problem had become particularly interesting since the discovery a whole family of steady - state force - free solutions continuously parametrised by the location of their y - point @xcite .",
    "our results indicate the existence of a unique steady - state mhd solution to the problem and this solution is very close to the force - free stationary solution of the pulsar equation with the y - point located at the light cylinder  the original solution of pulsar found by contopoulos et al .. why this solution is preferable to those whose y - point is located well inside the light cylinder has already been explained in @xcite .",
    "if resistivity is not vanishingly small then even if the initial solution had the dead zone buried well inside the light cylinder it would take only a finite time for the anti - parallel field lines of the current sheet between the y - point and the light cylinder to reconnect and to form closed loops that become a part of the dead zone .",
    "the reconnection should also occur beyond the light cylinder but there the outflow is super - alfvnic so the net outcome of the reconnection is likely to be the development of magnetic islands carried by the wind away from the star @xcite .",
    "the rate of the reconnection depends on the actual resistivity in the current sheet , and in our simulations the resistivity is purely artificial . however , the ultimate outcome is unlikely to be different . indeed , since the particle inertia on the closed field lines located well inside the light cylinder of pulsar magnetospheres is extremely small there is no restoring force that would make this field lines to open up again .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the total electromagnetic energy of the force - free magnetosphere is minimum when the y - point is located on the light cylinder @xcite .    at this point",
    "it makes sense to discuss whether the relaxation procedure applied within @xmath189 ( see sec.4.2 ) could somehow promote the expansion of the dead zone towards the light cylinder . as we have already pointed out in sec.4.2 all relaxation times gradually increase towards infinity as @xmath190 .",
    "thus , near the light cylinder the effect of the relaxation procedure on the flow is increasingly small .",
    "moreover , the relaxation time for the gas pressure becomes infinite at @xmath191 .",
    "this would allow the build up of gas pressure required to support the equatorial current sheet should it exist within the light cylinder .",
    "however , in order to fully resolve this issue we carried out additional simulations with the radius of the relaxation sphere pushed down to @xmath192 .",
    "figure  [ forcing ] allows to compare both solutions with regard to the location of the y - point .",
    "the colour image in this figure shows the distribution of @xmath16 and the solid lines show the magnetic surfaces for the model with @xmath192 whereas the dashed lines show the magnetic surfaces for the model with @xmath131 .",
    "as one can see more field lines open up for smaller @xmath132 and this is caused by the increased dynamical role of the centrifugal force .",
    "however , the location of y - point remains basically the same .",
    "thus , our relaxation procedure can not be considered as the reason for the dead zone extending all the way up to the light cylinder .",
    "contopoulos also pointed out that the open field lines of pulsar magnetospheres may rotate at a slower rate than the closed field lines of the dead zone due to the finite potential gap of the polar cap .",
    "in particular , he speculated about the possibility of a significant growth of the polar gap due to a sudden decrease of the particle injection rate in the gap in order to explain the explosive phenomena like the december 27 , 2004 burst in sgr 1806 - 20 .",
    "although , it is not clear what could cause such a sudden incident of `` charge starvation '' it was suggested long ago that a slow systematic evolution of the polar gap could result from the gradual spin - down of the star @xcite .",
    "thus , differentially rotating magnetospheres are not just interesting theoretical models but can be very much relevant for the real pulsars .",
    "contopoulos found force - free stationary numerical solutions for such magnetospheres in the simple case of a uniformly rotating polar cap and a uniformly rotating dead zone which was assumed to corotate with the star .",
    "( in fact , the dead zone may also have a potential gap that separates electric charges of opposite sign but it is expected to be rather small @xcite . ) these solutions have two light cylinders  a smaller one for the dead zone and and a larger one for the open field lines and the dead zone extends all the way up to its light cylinder .",
    "contopoulos argued that although there existed solutions with a smaller dead zone they were not sustainable due to reconnection in the part of the equatorial current sheet that runs between the y - point and the light cylinder of the dead zone .",
    "in fact , the numerical models constructed by contopoulos are likely to be globally unstable to reconnection too .",
    "indeed , in these models the equatorial current sheet continues inside the light cylinder of open magnetosphere and magnetic reconnection occurring in this region should lead to creation of new closed field lines .",
    "however , this case is somewhat more involved .",
    "let us imagine that such reconnection has indeed occurred .",
    "the field lines that have just closed down are now beginning to spin - up and corotate with the dead zone .",
    "however , they extend beyond the light cylinder of the dead zone and for this reason they can not corotate with it  as they spin - up they begin opening up again . once have been opened up they begin to slow down , thus creating conditions for the next closing down event , and so on .",
    "this simple analysis suggests that such differentially rotating magnetospheres can not be stationary and have to develop oscillations .",
    "the typical time scale of such magnetospheric oscillations seems to be determined by the spin - up time that must be comparable with the time required for an alfvn wave to cross the distance between the light cylinder of the dead zone and the star back and forward . since the alfvn speed is relativistic and the magnetic field has a significant radial component the crossing time has to be comparable with with rotational period of the star .",
    "the reconnection rate is more likely to effect the amplitude of these oscillations rather than their time - scale , a quicker reconnection leading to a larger fraction of magnetic field lines involved in this process of closing down and opening up .",
    "we wo nt to speculate that these oscillations may be relevant to the origin of the sub - pulses of radio pulsars , e.g. @xcite . for periodic magnetospheric oscillations we would have a phenomena reminiscent of beating waves",
    " this may explain the so - called drifting sub - pulses .",
    "however , one may also expect quasi - periodic and even chaotic oscillations and they would results in a much more complicated behaviour of sub - pulses .",
    "our mhd solution has a number of interesting features that could not possibly be found in the ideal force - free solution of contopoulos et al.(1999 ) .",
    "some of them do not depend much on the details of resistivity like , for example , the centrifugal acceleration of the wind outside of the current sheet .",
    "others , like the ohmic dissipation and the wind acceleration in the equatorial current sheet , do and we have to exercise a reasonable degree of caution when interpreting them",
    " mhd simulations with only artificial resistivity can provide at most qualitatively correct description of such features .",
    "however , it is interesting that the dissipation of electromagnetic energy in the equatorial current sheet has already been considered as a promising explanation of the high luminosity gamma - ray emission from young pulsars @xcite .",
    "given the fact that these gamma - rays carry away a significant fraction of the spin - down power , up to 10% in the most extreme examples",
    "@xcite , and that pulsar magnetospheres are highly magnetically dominated , an efficient dissipation of poynting flux somewhere in the magnetosphere is needed to explain these observations , and the equatorial current sheet is one of the most natural locations for such dissipation . in particular , lyubarskii ( 1996 ) argued that this high energy emission originates from the current sheet just beyond the dead zone ( this is exactly where our simulations show most effective ohmic dissipation . ) the polarizational observations of the optical emission from the crab pulsar support this idea .",
    "this emission is found to be polarised parallel to the rotation axis at the peaks of the pulses and between the pulses ( within the pulses the polarisation vector rotates , which may be attributed to the rotation of the magnetosphere ) .",
    "this shows that the magnetic field of the emitting region is predominantly perpendicular to the rotation axis as it should be if this radiation is generated in the equatorial current sheet .",
    "i am particularly grateful to anatoly spitkovsky and yuri lyubarsky for countless discussions of the various aspects of this problem and appreciate the interesting comments made by leon mestel , vasily beskin , and maxim lyutikov on the first version of this paper .",
    "finally , this is the right place to thank the organises of the kitp program on the _ physics of astrophysical outflows and accretion discs _ ( c.gammie , o.blaes , h.spruit ) as well as the staff of kitp ucsb for the excellent opportunity to work on this problem during the spring of 2005 and to exchange views with many experts in the field , including jon arons , sergei bogovalov , dmitri uzdensky , and niccolo buccantini , from whom i have learned a lot .",
    "this research was funded by pparc under the rolling grant `` theoretical astrophysics in leeds '' and by the national science foundation under grant no .",
