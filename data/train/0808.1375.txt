    "in materials science and engineering , a class of simple models , known as fiber bundle models ( fbm ) , has proven to be very effective in practical applications such as fiber reinforced composites . in this context ,",
    "such models have a history that goes back to the twenties @xcite , and they constitute today an elaborate toolbox for studying such materials , rendering computer studies orders of magnitudes more efficient than brute force methods . since the late eighties @xcite , these models have received increasing attention in the physics community due to their deceivingly simple appearance coupled with an extraordinary richness of behaviors .",
    "as these models are just at the edge of what is possible analytically and typically not being very challenging from a numerical point of view so that extremely good statistics on large systems are available , they are perfect as model systems for studying failure phenomena as a part of theoretical physics .",
    "fracture and material stability has for practical reasons interested humanity ever since we started using tools : our pottery should be able to withstand handling , our huts should be able to withstand normal weather . as science took on the form",
    "we know today during the renaissance , leonardo da vinci studied five hundred years ago experimentally the strength of wires  fiber bundles  as a function of their length @xcite .",
    "systematic strength studies , but on beams , were also pursued systematic by galileo galilei one hundred years later , as was done by edme mariotte ( of gas law fame ) who pressurized vessels until they burst in connection with the construction of a fountain at versailles .",
    "for some reason , mainstream physics moved away from fracture and breakdown problems in the nineteenth century , and it is only during the last twenty years that fracture problems have been studied within physics proper .",
    "the reason for this is most probably the advent of the computer as a research tool , rendering problems that were beyond the reach of systematic theoretical study now accessible .",
    "if we were to single out the most important contribution from the physics community with respect to fracture phenomena , it must be the focus on _ fluctuations _ rather than averages .",
    "what good is the knowledge of the average behavior a system when faced with a single sample and this being liable to breakdown given the right fluctuation ?",
    "this review , being written by physicists , reflects this point of view , and hence , fluctuations play an important role throughout it .",
    "even though we may trace the study of fiber bundles to leonardo da vinci , their modern story starts with the already mentioned work by @xcite . in 1945 , daniels published a seminal review cum research article on fiber bundles which still today must be regarded as essential reading in the field @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the fiber bundle model is treated as a problem of statistics and the analysis is performed within this framework , rather than treating it within materials science .",
    "the fiber bundle is viewed as a collection of elastic objects connected in parallel and clamped to a medium that transmits forces between the fibers .",
    "the elongation of a fiber is linearly related to the force it carries up to a maximum value .",
    "when this value is reached , the fiber fails by no longer being able to carry any force .",
    "the threshold value is assigned from some initially chosen probability distribution , and do not change thereafter .",
    "when the fiber fails , the force it carried is redistributed .",
    "if the clamps deform under loading , fibers closer to the just - failed fiber will absorb more of the force compared to those further away .",
    "if the clamps , on the other hand , are rigid , the force is equally distributed to all the surviving fibers .",
    "daniels discussed this latter case . a typical question posed and answered in this paper",
    "would be the average strength of a bundle of @xmath0 fibers , but also the variance of the average strength of the entire bundle .",
    "the present review takes the same point of view , discussing the fiber bundle model as a _ statistical model .",
    "_ only in section v we discuss the fiber bundle model in the context of materials science with all the realism of real materials considered",
    ". however , we have not attempted to include any discussions of the many experimental studies that have been performed on systems where fiber bundles constitute the appropriate tool .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this statistical - physics based review .    after introducing ( section ii ) the fiber bundle model to our readers , in section iii",
    ", we present the _ equal load sharing model , _ which was sketched just a few lines back .",
    "this seemingly simple model is in fact extremely rich .",
    "for example , the load at which catastrophic failure occurs is a _",
    "second order critical point _ with essentially all the features usually seen in systems displaying such behavior .",
    "however in this case , the system is analytically tractable .",
    "in fact , we believe that the equal load sharing fiber bundle may be an excellent system for teaching second order phase transitions at the college level . under the heading of fluctuations , we discuss the burst distribution , i.e. , the statistics of simultaneously failing fibers during loading : when a fiber fails and the force it was carrying is redistributed , one or more other fibers may be driven above their failing thresholds . in this equal load sharing model , the absolute rigidity of the bar ( transmitting forces among the fibers )",
    "suppresses the stress fluctuations among the fibers . as such",
    ", there is no apparent growth of the ( fluctuation correlation ) length scale .",
    "hence , although there are precise recursion relations and their linearized solutions are available near the fixed point ( see sec .",
    "iii ) , no straight forward application of the renormalization group techniques @xcite has been made to extract the exponents through length scaling .    in section iv _ local load sharing _ is discussed .",
    "this bit of added realism comes at the added cost that analytical treatment becomes much more difficult .",
    "there are , still , a number of analytical results in the literature .",
    "one may see intuitively how local load sharing complicates the problem , since the relative positions of the fibers now become important . under global load sharing ,",
    "every surviving fibers gets the same excess force and , hence , where they are do not matter .",
    "there are essentially three local load sharing models in the literature .",
    "the first one dictates that the _ nearest surviving neighbors _ of the failing fiber absorb its load .",
    "then there are  softer models \" where the redistribution follows a power law in the distance to the failing fiber .",
    "lastly , there is the model where the clamps holding the fibers are elastic themselves , and this leads to non - equal redistribution of the forces .",
    "section v contains a review of the use of fiber bundle models in applications such as materials science .",
    "we discuss fatigue , thermal failure , viscoelastic effects and precursors of global failure .",
    "we then go on to review the large field of modeling fiber reinforced composites . here",
    "fiber bundle models constitute the starting point of the analysis , which , by its very nature , is rather complex seen from the viewpoint of statistical physics .",
    "lastly , we review some applications of fiber bundle models in connection with systems that initially would seem quite far from the concept of a fiber bundle , such as traffic jams .",
    "we end this review by a summary with few concluding remarks in section vi .",
    "imagine a heavy load hanging from a rigid anchor point ( say , at the roof ) by a rope or a bundle of fibers .",
    "if the load exceeds a threshold value , the bundle fails .",
    "how does the failure proceeds in the bundle ? unless all the fibers in the bundle have got identical breaking thresholds ( and that never happens in a real rope ) , the failure dynamics proceeds in a typical collective load transfer way .",
    "one can assume that in this kind of situation the load is equally shared by all the intact fibers in the bundle .",
    "however , the breaking threshold for each of the fibers being different , some fibers fail before others and , consequently , the load per surviving fiber increases as it gets redistributed and shared equally by the rest .",
    "this increased load per fiber may induce further breaking of some fibers and the avalanche continues , or it stops if all the surviving fibers can withstand the redistributed load per fiber .",
    "this collective or cooperative failure dynamics and the consequent avalanches or bursts are typical for the failure in any many - body system .",
    "it captures the essential features of failure during fracture propagation ( recorded by acoustic emissions ) , earthquake avalanches ( main and aftershocks ) , traffic jams ( due to dynamic clustering ) , etc .",
    "the model was first introduced in @xmath1 by @xcite in the context of textile engineering .",
    "since then it was modified a little and investigated , mainly numerically , with various realistic fiber threshold distributions by the engineering community @xcite . starting from late eighties , physicists took interest in the avalanche distribution in the model and in its dynamics @xcite .",
    "a recursive dynamical equation was set up for the equal - load - sharing version recently @xcite and the dynamic critical behavior is now solved exactly @xcite .",
    "in addition to the extensive numerical results @xcite on the effect of short - range fluctuations ( local load sharing cases ) , some progress with analytical studies @xcite have also been made .",
    "there are a large number of experimental studies of various materials and phenomena that have successfully been analyzed within the framework of the fiber bundle model .",
    "for example , @xcite have used the fiber bundle model to propose explanations for changes in fibrious collagen and its relation to neuropathy in connection with diabetes .",
    "@xcite propose a method to monitor the structural integrity of fiber - reinforced ceramic - matrix composites using electrical resistivity measurements .",
    "the basic idea here is that when the fibers in the composite themselves fail rather than just the matrix in which they are embedded , the structure is about to fail .",
    "the individual fiber failures is recorded through changes in the electrical conductivity of the material .",
    "acoustic emission , the crackling sounds emitted by materials as they are loaded , provide yet another example where fiber bundle models play and important role , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "= 1.7 in    the simplest and the oldest version of the model is the equal load sharing ( els ) model , in which the load previously carried by a failed fiber is shared equally by all the remaining intact fibers in the system . as the applied load is shared globally , this model is also known as global load sharing ( gls ) model or democratic fiber bundle model . due to the consequent mean - field nature",
    ", some exact results could be extracted for this model and this was demonstrated by @xcite in a classic work some sixty years ago .",
    "the typical relaxation dynamics of this model has been solved recently which has clearly established a robust critical behavior @xcite .",
    "it may be mentioned at the outset that the els or gls models do not allow for spatial fluctuations ( due to the absolute rigidity of the platform in fig",
    ". 1 ) and hence such models belong to the the mean field category of critical dynamics , see e.g. , @xcite . fluctuations in breaking time or in avalanche statistics ( due to randomness in fiber strengths ) are of course possible in such models and are discussed in details in this section .    a bundle can be loaded in two different ways : strain controlled and force controlled . in the strain controlled method , at each step the whole bundle is stretched till the weakest fiber fails . clearly ,",
    "when number of fibers @xmath0 is very large , strain is increased by infinitesimal amount at each step until complete breakdown and therefore the process is considered as a _ quasi - static _ way of loading . on the other hand , in the force controlled method , the external force ( load ) on the bundle",
    "is increased by same amount at each step until the breakdown .",
    "the basic difference between these two methods is that the first method ensures the failure of single fiber ( weakest one among the intact fibers ) at each loading step , while in the second method sometimes none of the fibers fail and sometimes more than one fail in one loading step .",
    "let @xmath2 denote the strain of the fibers in the bundle .",
    "assuming the fibers to be linearly elastic up to their respective failure point ( with unit elastic constant ) , we can represent the stresses on each of the surviving fibers by the same quantity @xmath2 .",
    "the strength ( or threshold ) of a fiber is usually determined by the stress value @xmath2 it can bear , and beyond which it fails .",
    "we therefore denote the strength ( threshold ) distribution of the fibers in the bundle by @xmath3 and the corresponding cumulative distribution by @xmath4 .",
    "two popular examples of threshold distributions are the uniform distribution @xmath5 and the weibull distribution @xmath6 here @xmath7 is a reference threshold , and the dimensionless number @xmath8 is the weibull index ( fig .",
    "[ fig : distributions ] ) .    in the strain controlled loading , at a strain @xmath2 ,",
    "the total force on the bundle is @xmath2 times the number of intact fibers .",
    "the expected or average force at this stage is therefore @xcite @xmath9 the maximum @xmath10 of @xmath11 corresponds to the value @xmath12 for which @xmath13 vanishes : @xmath14 here the failure process is basically driven by _",
    "fluctuations _ and can be analyzed using extreme order statistics @xcite .    in the force",
    "controlled method , if force @xmath15 is applied on a bundle having @xmath0 fibers , when the system reaches an equilibrium , the strain or effective stress @xmath2 is ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fbm - model ] ) @xmath16}. \\label{strain}\\ ] ] therefore , at the equilibrium state , eq .",
    "( [ load ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ strain ] ) are identical .",
    "it is possible to construct recursive dynamics @xcite of the failure process for a given load and the fixed - point solutions explore the _ average behavior _ of the system at the equilibrium state .      fig .",
    "[ fig : fbm - model ] shows a static fiber bundle model in the els mode where @xmath0 fibers are connected in parallel to each other ( clamped at both ends ) and a force is applied at one end . at the first step all fibers that can not withstand the applied stress break .",
    "then the stress is redistributed on the surviving fibers , which compels further fibers to break .",
    "this starts an iterative process that continues until an equilibrium is reached , or all fibers fail .",
    "the average behavior is manifested when the initial load is macroscopic ( very large @xmath0 ) .",
    "the breaking dynamics can be represented by recursion relations @xcite in discrete steps .",
    "let @xmath17 be the number of fibers that survive after step @xmath18 , where @xmath18 indicates the number of stress redistribution steps",
    ". then one can write @xcite @xmath19.\\ ] ]    now we introduce @xmath20 , the applied stress and @xmath21 , the surviving fraction of total fibers .",
    "then the effective stress after @xmath18 step becomes @xmath22 and after @xmath23 steps the surviving fraction of total fibers is @xmath24 .",
    "therefore we can construct the following recursion relations @xcite : @xmath25    and @xmath26    at equilibrium @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "these equations ( eq .",
    "[ rec - x ] and eq .",
    "[ rec - u ] ) can be solved at and around the fixed points for the particular strength distribution @xmath3 .",
    "let us choose the uniform density of fiber strength distribution ( eq . [ uniform ] ) up to the cutoff @xmath29 .",
    "then the cumulative distribution becomes @xmath30 .",
    "therefore from eq .",
    "( [ rec - x ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ rec - u ] ) we can construct a pair of recursion relations @xmath31 and @xmath32 this nonlinear recursion equations are somewhat characteristic of the dynamics of fiber bundle models and such dynamics can be obtained in many different ways .",
    "for example , the failed fraction @xmath33 at step @xmath23 is given by the fraction @xmath34 of the load shared by the intact fibers at step @xmath18 and for the uniform distribution of thresholds ( fig .",
    "[ fig : distributions]a ) , one readily gets eq .",
    "( [ rec - u - uniform ] ) .    at the fixed point",
    "the above relations take the quadratic forms @xmath35 and @xmath36 with the solutions @xmath37 and @xmath38 here @xmath39 is the critical value of applied stress beyond which the bundle fails completely . clearly , for the effective stress ( eq .",
    "[ sol - x - uniform ] ) solution with @xmath40 sign is the stable fixed point and with @xmath41 sign is the unstable fixed point whereas for fraction of unbroken fibers",
    "( eq . [ sol - u - uniform ] ) , it is just the opposite .",
    "now the difference @xmath42 behaves like an order parameter signaling partial failure of the bundle when it is non - zero ( positive ) , although unlike conventional phase transitions it does not have a real - valued existence for @xmath43",
    ".    @xmath44    fig .",
    "[ fig : uso ] shows the variation of @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 with the externally applied stress value @xmath48 .",
    "one can also obtain the breakdown susceptibility @xmath49 , defined as the change of @xmath50 due to an infinitesimal increment of the applied stress @xmath48 : @xmath51 such a divergence in @xmath49 had already been reported in several studies @xcite .    to study the dynamics away from criticality ( @xmath52 from below ) , the recursion relation ( eq .",

    "when the force carried by a fiber reaches its breaking threshold , it breaks irreversibly and the forces redistribute themselves through the deformation of the soft clamp .",

    "in fact the avalanche statistics discussed in section iii.b can easily explain the gutenberg - richter law ( eq . [ gr - law ] ) with the identification @xmath1151 .",
    "similarly , the decay of the number of failed fibers @xmath1152 at the critical point , given by @xmath1153 ( see e.g. , eq . [",
    "eq : fbm - omori ] ) , crudely speaking , gives in turn the omori law behavior ( eq .",
    "[ omori - law ] ) for the fiber bundle model , with the identification @xmath1154 .",
    "for some recent discussions on further studies along these lines , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the stick - slip motion in the burridge - knopoff model ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , where the blocks ( representing portion of the solid crust ) connected with springs ( representing the elastic strain developed due to tectonic motion ) are pulled uniformly on a rough surface , has the same feature of stress redistribution as one or more blocks slip and the dynamics was mapped onto a els fiber bundle model by @xcite .",
    "the power law distributions of the fluctuation driven bursts around the critical points have been interpreted as the above two statistical laws for earthquakes .",
    "the fiber bundle model enjoys a rare double position in that it is both useful in a practical setting for describing a class of real materials under real working conditions , and at the same time being abstract enough to function as a model for exploring fundamental breakdown mechanisms from a general point of view .",
    "very few models are capable of such a double life .",
    "this means that a review of the fiber bundle model may take on very different character depending on the point of view .",
    "we have in this review emphasized the fiber bundle model as a model for exploring fundamental breakdown mechanisms .",
    "failure in loaded disordered materials is a collective phenomenon .",
    "it proceeds through a competition between disorder and stress distribution .",
    "the disorder implies a distribution of local strength .",
    "if the stress distribution were uniform in the material , it would be the weakest spot that would fail first .",
    "suppose now that there has been a local failure at a given spot in the material .",
    "the further away we go from this failed region , the weaker the weakest region within this distance will be .",
    "hence , the disorder makes local failures repel each other : they will occur as far as possible from each other .",
    "however , as the material fails locally , the stresses are redistributed .",
    "this redistribution creates hot spots where local failure is likely due to high stresses .",
    "since these hot spots occur at the boundaries of the failed regions , the effect of the stress field is an attraction between the local failures @xcite .",
    "hence , disorder and stress has opposite effect on the breakdown process ; repulsion vs.  attraction , and this leads to competition between them . since the disorder in the strength of the material , leading to repulsion , dimishes throughout the breakdown process , whereas the stresses create increasingly important hot spots , it is the stress distribution that ends up dominating towards the end of the process .",
    "the fiber bundle model catches this essential aspect of the failure process . depending on the load redistribution mechanism , the quantitative aspects change .",
    "however , qualitatively it remains the same . in the els case , there are no _ localized _ hot spots , all surviving fibers are loaded the same way .",
    "geometry does not enter into the redistribution of forces , and we may say that the  hot spots \" include all surviving fibers .",
    "this aspect gives the els fiber bundle model its mean field character , even though all other fluctuations are present , such as those giving rise to bursts .",
    "as shown in section iii , the lack of geometrical aspects in the redistribution of forces in the els model enables us to construct the recursion relations ( e.g. , eq . [ rec - u ] ) which capture well the failure dynamics .",
    "we find that the eventual statistics , governed by the fixed points for @xmath1155 , the average strength of the bundle , essentially shows a normal critical behavior : order parameter @xmath1156 , breakdown susceptibility @xmath1157 and relaxation time @xmath1158 with @xmath1159 and @xmath1160 for a bundle of @xmath0 fibers , where subscripts @xmath1161 and @xmath687 refers to post and pre critical cases respectively .",
    "the statistics of fluctuations over these average behavior , given by the avalanche size distributions @xmath1162 with @xmath1163 for discrete load increment and @xmath1164 for quasi - static load increment in such els cases .",
    "the critical stress @xmath90 of the bundle is of course nonuniversal and its magnitude depends on the fiber strength distribution .    for the lls model , we essentially find ( see section iv.a ) , the critical strength of the fiber bundle @xmath1165 which vanishes in the macroscopic system size limit . the avalanche size distribution is exponential for such cases . for range - dependent redistribution of load ( see section iv.b ) one recovers the finite value of @xmath90 and the els - like mean field behavior for its failure statistics",
    ".    extensions of the model to capture creep and fatigue behavior of composite materials are discussed in section v.a .",
    "precursors of global failure are discussed in section v.b .",
    "it appears , a detailed knowledge of the critical behavior of the model can help very precise determination of the global failure point from the well defined precursors .",
    "section v.c provides a rather cursory review of models of fiber reinforced composites .",
    "these models go far beyond the simple fiber bundle model in complexity and represent the state of the art of theoretical approaches to this important class of materials . however , as complicated as these models are , the philosophy of the fiber bundle model is still very much present .",
    "finally we discussed a few extensions of the model to failures in communication networks , traffic jams and earthquakes in section v.d .",
    "as discussed here in details , the fiber bundle model not only gives an elegant and profound solution of the dynamic critical phenomena of failures in disordered systems , with the associated universality classes etc , but also offers the first solution to the entire linear and non - linear stress - strain behavior for any material up to its fracture or rupture point .",
    "although the model had been introduced at about the same time ( @xmath1 ) as the ising model for static critical phenomena , it is only now that the full ( mean - field ) critical dynamics in the fiber bundle model is solved .",
    "apart from these , as already discussed , several aspects of the fluctuations in this model are now well understood .",
    "even from this specific point of view , the model is not only intuitively very attractive , its behavior is extremely rich and intriguing",
    ". it would be surprising if it did not offer new profound insights into failure phenomena also in the future .",
