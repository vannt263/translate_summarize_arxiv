    "spectroscopic studies have been used to assemble a complete understanding of the structure of atoms and simple molecules @xcite .",
    "the static structure factor @xmath0 is a fundamental quantity , which is connected with the atomic structure , and it is the fourier transform of the radial distribution function @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath0 gives the magnitude of the density fluctuation in the system ( atomic , molecular , electronic or nuclear system ) at wavelength @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the momentum transfer . in recent papers ,",
    "the bragg spectroscopic method was used to measure @xmath0 either in the phonon regime @xcite or / and in the single - particle regime @xcite .    more specifically , the character of excitations in a weakly interacting bose - einstein condensed gas depends on the relation between the wave vector of the excitation @xmath3 and the inverse healing length @xmath4 , which is the wave vector related to the speed of bogoliubov sound @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the chemical potential , @xmath7 is the scattering length , @xmath8 is the condensate density , and @xmath9 is the atomic mass @xcite .",
    "there are two different regimes of excitation described by the bogoliubov theory for the zero - temperature weakly interacting bose - einstein condensate : the phonon and the free - particle regimes . for small wave vectors ( @xmath10 )",
    ", the gas responds collectively and density perturbations propagate as phonons at the speed of bogoliubov sound . for large wave vectors ( @xmath11 )",
    "the excitations are particle - like with a quadratic dispersion relation @xcite .    in the present letter we focus on the theoretical calculation of @xmath0 of a bose gas .",
    "all the calculations are performed in the zero - temperature limit ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "various types of trial functions @xmath1 are used and the entailed @xmath0 are compared with the experimental data .",
    "the correlation parameters of @xmath1 are determined by fit to the experimental data .",
    "the theoretical investigation is performed by applying two approaches . in the first approach ,",
    "the bose gas is treated as inhomogeneous gas , which is exactly the case of the experiments @xcite .",
    "we consider that the bose gas is trapped in a harmonic oscillator well with condensate radius @xmath13 . in the second approach ,",
    "the trapped bose gas is treated , in a rough approximation , as homogeneous gas in regard to its elementary excitations .",
    "this approximate treatment is reasonable in the sense that the coherence length @xmath14 satisfies the condition @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "actually in the experiments of refs .",
    "@xcite this condition is well satisfied .    as mentioned before , the key quantity of the above approaches , is the radial distribution function @xmath1 , which describes the relative probability for finding two particles at a distance @xmath16 apart and consequently it introduces the atomic correlations . in general",
    ", the function @xmath1 can be calculated by the variational method @xcite . however , in dilute bose gas , in the framework of the lowest - order cluster expansion , trial expressions for @xmath1 can be used @xcite and the parameters can be fitted to reproduce the experimental data of @xmath0 . up to now ,",
    "@xmath0 in a trapped bose gas , is predicted successfully ( compared to the experimental data ) by the local density approximation @xcite .",
    "the motivation of the present work is the theoretical study of @xmath0 , considering the bose gas as a many - body system .",
    "it is well known that the ideal bose gas model ( noninteracting model ) fails to reproduce the experimental values of @xmath0 .",
    "we focus our treatment on the effect of interatomic interaction on the properties of @xmath0 , both in small and large values of the momentum transfer @xmath3 .",
    "it is fundamental to investigate how these effects modify the picture of @xmath0 of an ideal gas and to predict values consistent with the experimental data . the possibility of linear behavior of @xmath0 for small @xmath3 , both in inhomogeneous and homogeneous bose gas has also been examined . in section 2 we treat the inhomogeneous bose gas while the case of homogeneous bose gas is investigated in section 3 .",
    "a dilute inhomogeneous bose gas can be studied using the low - order approximation ( loa ) @xcite . in the loa",
    "the two - body density distribution ( tbdd ) has the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is the jastrow correlation function @xcite , @xmath20 is the radial distribution function , @xmath21 is the normalization factor which ensures that @xmath22 ( n is the number of the atoms of the bose condensate ) and @xmath23 is the density distribution ( dd ) of the system .",
    "the tbdd is proportional to the probability of simultaneously finding an atom at @xmath24 and another at @xmath25 . in the uncorrelated case ( noninteracting gas )",
    "the tbdd takes the simple form @xmath26    in the present work we consider that the atoms are confined in a harmonic oscillator trap where the ground state single - particle wave function @xmath27 has the form @xmath28 , \\qquad b=[\\hbar/(m\\omega)]^{1/2}.\\ ] ] the normalization of the dd is @xmath29 .",

    "( [ str - fin2 ] ) can be performed if the function @xmath1 is know .",
    "@xmath1 must obey the rules @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the first rule introduces the repulsive correlations between the atoms and the second the absence of such correlations in long distances . in general the form of @xmath0",
    "is affected appreciably from the form of @xmath1 .",
    "more specifically , the long range behavior of @xmath1 affects @xmath0 for small values of @xmath3 while the short range behaviour of it affects @xmath0 for large values of @xmath3 as a direct consequence of the fourier transform theory .    in the present work ,",
    "we choose two trial forms for @xmath1 .",
    "the first one is a gaussian type which has been extensively and successfully used for the study of similar problems in atomic physics ( bose gas , liquid helium ) as well in nuclear physics .",
    "the relevant @xmath1 and the entailed @xmath0 are @xmath34\\nonumber \\\\ s(k)&=&1+n(c_1 - 1)\\exp[-k_b^2/2 ] -\\frac{n c_1}{(1 + 2y^2)^{3/2}}\\exp[-k_b^2/2(1 + 2y ) ] , \\label{fin - cs-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the correlation parameter and @xmath38 is the normalization factor .    the second trial function @xmath1 and the relevant @xmath0 are of the form @xmath39 \\nonumber\\\\ & - & \\frac{n c_2}{2^{15/2 } ab \\pi k_b } \\sum_{i=1}^{5 } \\alpha_i\\left[\\beta_i\\exp[-\\beta_i^2/4]+ \\sqrt{\\pi}(1+\\frac{\\beta_i^2}{2 } ) { \\rm erf}(\\frac{\\beta_i}{2 } ) \\right ] \\label{fin - cs-2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the correlation parameter , @xmath40",
    "are known coefficients , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the normalization factor .",
    "trial functions @xmath1 of hard - sphere form ( @xmath44 ) and soft repulsive form ( @xmath45 ) are also used . both of them , lead either to the ideal bose gas results ( negligible correlations ) or to abnormal fluctuating negative and positive values for @xmath0 ( strong correlations ) and consequently in complete disagreement with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "therefore , it should be emphasized that the choice of a trial function @xmath1 should be made under certain restrictions in order to get reasonable values for @xmath0 .    the behavior of s(k ) , in case 1 , for different values of the correlation parameter @xmath37 is shown in fig .",
    "it is obvious that the effect of correlations , induced by the function @xmath1 , becomes large when the parameter @xmath37 becomes small and vice versa .",
    "the case where @xmath46 , corresponds to the uncorrelated case ( ho ) . for the values of @xmath3 employed in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter exp-1 ) the prediction of the ho model is always close to 1 for @xmath0 .",
    "when the correlation parameter @xmath37 decreases considerably ( strong correlations ) the theoretical prediction of @xmath0 is in good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the value @xmath47 gives the best least squares fit in that case .",
    "in general the gaussian form of @xmath1 , in spite of its simplicity , reproduces fairly well the experimental data of exp-1 , both in low and high values of the momentum @xmath3 .",
    "it reproduces also the experimental data of ref .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter exp-2 ) as can been seen from fig .",
    "1(c ) . within our theoretical model ,",
    "the gaussian type of @xmath1 is flexible enough to obtain values for @xmath0 in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "1(b ) displays the results in case 2 , which are compared with those of the data of exp-1 .",
    "the model reproduces well the experimental data in the range @xmath48 ( with best least squares fit value @xmath49 ) , but fails in the range @xmath50 .",
    "the main drawback of this model is the predicted negative values of @xmath0 in the range close to @xmath51 when the correlation parameter @xmath7 decreases considerably ( strong correlation case ) .",
    "the correlation function @xmath1 corresponding to cases 1 and 2 for the correlation parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively is sketched in fig .",
    "those values of the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath7 give the best @xmath54 value in the fit of the theoretical expressions of @xmath0 to the data of exp-1 . the most striking feature in case 2",
    "is the existence of strong correlations , introduced by @xmath1 , in order to reproduce the experimental data of @xmath0 .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that @xmath1 , in case 2 , exhibits fluctuations in the range @xmath55 but this is not visible in fig .",
    "the possibility of a linear dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath3 for small values of @xmath3 , as predicted from other works @xcite , is prohibitive , on the basis of eq .",
    "( [ str - fin ] ) at least in the case where the trap is an harmonic oscillator one . that can be seen considering the ground state wave function to be the harmonic oscillator one and transforming @xmath24 and @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ str - fin ] ) into the coordinates of the relative motion ( @xmath56 ) and the center of mass motion ( @xmath57 ) .",

    "so that : @xmath62    substituting eq .",
    "( [ expand ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ sk - rel ] ) and considering that the terms with odd powers of @xmath3 do not contribute on the integral , @xmath0 takes the form @xmath63    thus , for small values of @xmath3 , @xmath0 depends linearly on @xmath64 .",
    "the gaussian factor @xmath65 , originating from the harmonic oscillator wave function of the trapped bose gas , ensures the convergence of the integrals @xmath66 corresponding to the even powers of the expansion .",
    "the condensate of an inhomogeneous ( finite ) bose gas , can be treated as homogeneous in regard to its elementary excitations considering that the coherence length @xmath14 satisfies @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "actually , this is a rough approximation , but can effectively describe fairly well the excitation properties of a trapped bose gas .    in infinite systems",
    "@xmath68 is constant ( @xmath69 ) and thus the tbdd is given by @xmath70 .",

    "( [ conditions ] ) , the correlation parameters of @xmath1 , in all the cases , depend directly on the density @xmath8 .",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "the values of @xmath0 in case 3 ( gaussian @xmath1 ) for various values of the constant density @xmath8 ( or of the correlation parameter @xmath37 ) are displayed in fig .",

    "we note that in the uncorrelated case ( noninteracting model ) , the static structure factor of homogeneous bose gas has the constant value @xmath86 .",
    "when the density of the bose gas increases , the calculated values of @xmath0 deviates from the experimental data , exhibiting considerably lower values at the same range of the momentum transfer @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 behaves quadratically in the phonon regime ( @xmath87 ) , in contradiction with the condition ( [ conditions ] ) , as a result of the improper long range behavior of @xmath1 ( see eq .",
    "( [ beh1/r4 ] ) ) .    the behavior of @xmath0 , in case 4",
    ", is illustrated in fig .",
    "3(b ) . a striking future in this case is the linear behavior of @xmath0 ( @xmath88 ) , in the phonon regime , as a consequence of the proper long range behavior of the function @xmath1 .",

    "the behavior of the correlation function @xmath1 , for cases 3,4 and 5 , is sketched in fig .",
    "the most striking feature is that though the behavior of @xmath1 is almost the same in cases 3 and 4 , the corresponding @xmath0 , display different behavior , especially for the lower values of the momentum @xmath3 .",

    "it is worth remarking that a correlation function of the hard - sphere form , @xmath44 , thought it is as realistic one , mainly for low values of the interatomic distance @xmath16 , leads to @xmath92 which diverges when @xmath93 . in conclusion",
