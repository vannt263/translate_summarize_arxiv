    "the linewidth of this asymmetric peak has not been understood so far@xcite . the same studies also note that the typical field condition of an in - plane field aligning both magnetic layers in parallel should not result in any st , calling into question the fundamental excitation mechanism of the observed spectra .",
    "this significant discrepancy has been tentatively explained as being caused by local misalignments due to sample imperfections .",
    "however , given how robust st - fmr measurements are over sets of different devices , it is rather unsatisfactory to have to refer to unknown extrinsic factors for the st - fmr technique to function .",
    "it appears that the _ rf _ oersted field generated by the injected microwave current into nc could be at play@xcite .",

    "we show that the observed resonance spectrum in a nife nc - sto free layer is _ composite _ in nature and can be described as a sum of two distinct resonances with very different behavior and origin .",

    ", width=316 ]    due to the collinear free and fixed layers we do not expect any significant contribution from the st to the observed magnetization dynamics , which is confirmed by comparing micromagnetic simulations performed with and without st included . correspondingly , for the in - plane applied magnetic fields in the nc geometry with no _ dc _ bias currents applied , the _ rf _ oersted field is the primary excitation mechanism responsible for the observed dynamics .    in a linear approximation",
    "the response of the system is essentially determined by the spectrum of the excitation , which in our case is provided by the _ rf _",
    "oersted field .",
    "if the excitation has a finite amplitude at some point of reciprocal space ( _ i.e. _ at the given frequency and wavevector ) , then , if allowed , the corresponding magnon will be excited .",
    "the spatial profile of the oersted field and its spectrum for the @xmath29 nm nc are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "we can identify both local and global anti - symmetries with respect to the nc center with corresponding periods determined by twice the nc diameter and mesa width , @xmath38 , respectively . since both spatial components are naturally confined to their unit periods ,",
    "the linewidth of the corresponding excitation peak is finite .",
    "therefore the oersted field most efficiently couples to the sw bands having widths of @xmath39 and @xmath40 corresponding to the wavevectors of @xmath39 and @xmath41 , respectively , where @xmath42 ( see fig .  [ fig:7](c ) and its inset ) . as the nc diameter decreases , the position and width of the former band stays constant , while the latter one shifts towards lower resonance fields and increases its width , leading to the observed extension of the tail in the excitation spectrum .",
    "it is important to mention that the circular nc can not effectively couple to the uniform fmr . instead",
    ", the main peak observed in the experiments and simulations corresponds to the anti - symmetric mode with @xmath43 .",
    "however , due to the vanishing magnetostatic dispersion , its resonant field is virtually indistinguishable from the uniform @xmath44 fmr mode .    considering a typical fmr experiment where the excitation frequency is fixed , according to eq .",
    "( [ equation:3 ] ) the wavevector of the generated propagating sw is ultimately determined by the value of the applied magnetic field . as the field",
    "is swept towards zero past the dominant fmr resonance , the nc continuously excites propagating sws of increasing wavevectors .",
    "since the excitation amplitude drops rapidly for the low values of the applied field ( _ i.e. _ for short wavelength sws ) , the detected magnetic signal vanishes accordingly , leading to the appearance of the low - field tail , see fig .",
    "[ fig:7](c ) and ( e ) .    by assuming that the extent of the tail is estimated at 1/10 of the its peak amplitude",
    ", we can project the corresponding experimentally observed applied magnetic field to the cutoff wavevector of the excitation spectrum as schematically demonstrated by the shaded rectangles in fig .",
    "[ fig:7](c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) .",
    "this gives us the cut - off wavevectors ( in units of @xmath45 ) of 1.93 , 1.95 and 2.34 for the ncs of 90 , 160 and 240 nm nominal diameters , respectively .",
    "since these values fall roughly inside the first two fundamental sw bands attributed to @xmath43 and @xmath46 , the two - peak scheme used to fit the experimental data is fully justified .",
    "it should be noted that the micromagnetic simulations do not reproduce the shoulder as it is observed experimentally for all the nc diameters . according to our model",
    ", the shoulder should be inherited from the excitation spectrum .",
    "perhaps the approximation we used to calculate the oersted field , an infinite wire , is not sufficient to bring out this feature .",
    "nevertheless , this does not change the interpretation of the results and conclusions of the present study .    finally , the nc size dependence of the fmr and swr inhomogeneous broadenings shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] can be well understood by assuming that it is inherited from the linewidth of the corresponding excitation peaks . for the swr mode ,",
    "the expected extrinsic contribution to the magnonic linewidth is 96 mt , 43 mt and 15 mt for the nc diameters of 82 nm , 122 nm and 205 nm , respectively , in excellent agreement with the fitted values .",
    "in contrast , for the fmr the contribution is vanishing and should be virtually independent of the nc size .",
    "however , if the nc had shape imperfections , the corresponding irregularities in the oersted field profile should broaden the excitation peaks and , eventually , the fmr and swr .",
    "as we typically observe a less perfect nc for smaller diameters , the inhomogeneous broadening of fmr should increase accordingly , consistent with the experimental data .",
    "in conclusion , using homodyne based measurement techniques we provide an in - depth study of the magnetodynamics in a quasi - confined system , namely a nc patterned on an extended pseudo spin valve film stack .",
    "the observed spectra are highly asymmetric and can not be explained by a single resonance mode , as has been done in the past @xcite .",
    "instead , each spectra is fit by a combination of two lorentzians from which we can extract the fmr mode resonance field and linewidth .",
    "the secondary mode corresponds to the generation of exchange - dominated spin waves with a wavevector inversely proportional to the nc diameter .",
    "the results are reproduced by the micromagnetic simulations that show the _ rf _ oersted field generated by the injected _ rf _ current is the dominant excitation mechanism of the observed magnetization dynamics .",
    "we thereby demonstrate experimentally a highly tunable point source of the propagating sw with the wavevectors limited only by the resolution of the fabrication process used .",
    "this is of the paramount importance for the applications of sub - thz and thz magnonics and spintronics .",
