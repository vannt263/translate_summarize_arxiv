    "there have been various interesting observational records ( marsden 1967 , 1989 , 2005 ; strom 2002 ; sekanina & chodas 2012 ) of extremely bright and spectacular sungrazing comets since historical times .",
    "intuitively one would expect some of these to produce spectacular meteor showers ( like those from many jupiter family and halley type comets ) . in case of such a shower when sungrazers are involved ,",
    "there are two factors in favour of producing intense meteor phenomena .",
    "firstly these comets pass very close to the sun ( @xmath1 au ) which would enable more ices to sublime according to conventional understanding ( whipple 1950 ) and thereby eject more dust particles into similar orbits .",
    "secondly some sungrazers are dynamically new comets ( bailey , chambers & hahn 1992 ) , coming from the oort - pik cloud into the inner solar system for the first time , suggesting a strong possibility for more volatiles in their composition ( enhancing chances for strong outgassing ) .",
    "nevertheless we hardly observe any spectacular meteor activity on earth due to these frequently observed sungrazing comets .",
    "this work presents a mathematical formalism of demonstrating the absence of any strong meteor shower from comet c/2012 s1 ( ison ) . during this analysis",
    "some parallels are drawn with the famous newton s comet c/1680 v1 due to the surprisingly similar orbital elements .",
    "the same technique is then applied to all the known sungrazing families .",
    "we use the notation : + @xmath2 ( semi - major axis ) , @xmath3 ( eccentricity ) , @xmath4 ( perihelion distance ) , @xmath5 ( inclination ) , @xmath6 ( argument of pericentre ) , @xmath7 ( longitude of ascending node ) , @xmath8 ( longitude of pericentre ) , @xmath9 ( eccentric anomaly ) , @xmath10 ( true anomaly ) , @xmath11 ( radial component of meteoroid ejection acceleration / velocity ) , @xmath12 ( transverse component = in - plane , orthogonal to radial ) , @xmath13 ( normal component ) , @xmath14 ( mean motion ) , @xmath15 ( universal gravitational constant ) , @xmath16 ( mass of sun ) , @xmath17 ( time ) , @xmath18 ( heliocentric distance ) , @xmath19 ( heliocentric distance of ascending / descending node )      among the most critical parameters determining the feasibility of meteor showers on earth are the ascending and descending nodal distances of meteoroid particles :    @xmath20    @xmath21    the necessary condition ( but not sufficient ) for meteor activity on earth is : @xmath22 au or @xmath23 au .",

    "each interval spans @xmath3121 , and @xmath6 in one of these four ranges is a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for high @xmath3 sungrazers to undergo meteoroid intersection with earth .    although confirming the presence of a meteor shower on earth would depend on other parameters like time of nodal crossing , earth s precise position in its own orbit at that time and width of the dust trail , confirming the absence of significant meteor activity can be done using this necessary condition concerning the geometry of nodes .",
    "even if parent bodies nodal distances are quite far from earth s orbit , meteoroid ejection in different directions can change the nodal distances into @xmath32 and @xmath33 depending on the ejection velocity components . therefore checking these parameters for",
    "realistic values of cometary ejection velocities can verify whether the meteoroid stream s nodal distances can approach 1 au .    the mathematical technique underlying our analysis uses lagrange s planetary equations :    @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath36 + 2 \\frac{d \\omega}{dt } \\sin^{2}(\\frac{i}{2})\\ ] ]    @xmath37    equations ( 7 ) to ( 10 ) are taken from page 184 , roy ( 1978 ) . using the definition @xmath38 we have :    @xmath39\\ s + [ \\sin f(1+\\frac{r}{a(1-e^{2})})\\frac{\\sqrt { 1-e^{2}}}{nae } ] \\ t & \\\\ + [ ( 2\\sin^{2}(\\frac{i}{2})-1)(\\frac{r\\sin ( \\omega+f)}{na^{2}\\sqrt{1-e^{2}}\\ \\sin i})]w \\end{split}\\ ] ]    equation ( 11 ) can be shown to be equivalent to the expression on page 57 , murray & dermott ( 1999 ) :    @xmath40 & \\\\",

    "taking the differential of equation ( 1 ) and finding the expressions for the partial derivatives gives    @xmath42da + [ \\frac{-2ae(1+e\\cos\\omega)-a\\cos\\omega(1-e^{2})}{(1+e\\cos\\omega)^{2}}]de & \\\\ + [ \\frac{ae(1-e^{2})\\sin\\omega}{(1+e\\cos\\omega)^{2}}]d\\omega \\end{split}\\ ] ]    similarly equation ( 2 ) leads to    @xmath43da + [ \\frac{-2ae(1-e\\cos\\omega)+a\\cos\\omega(1-e^{2})}{(1-e\\cos\\omega)^{2}}]de & \\\\ +   [ \\frac{-ae(1-e^{2})\\sin\\omega}{(1-e\\cos\\omega)^{2}}]d\\omega \\end{split}\\ ] ]    equations ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) require expressions for @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "these orbital element changes can be related to the separate velocity components using ( 7 ) , ( 8) and ( 11 ) :    @xmath47dv_{r}+[\\frac{2a\\sqrt{(1-e^{2})}}{nr}]dv_{t}+[0]dv_{n}\\ ] ]    @xmath48dv_{r}+[\\frac{\\sqrt{1-e^{2}}}{na}(\\cos e+\\cos f)]dv_{t}+[0]dv_{n}\\ ] ]    @xmath49\\ dv_{r } + [ \\sin f(1+\\frac{r}{a(1-e^{2})})\\frac{\\sqrt { 1-e^{2}}}{nae } ] \\",

    "numerical checks confirmed these differential approximations to be good for the ranges in @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 up to @xmath531 km s@xmath0 where we apply them .",

    "thus only marsden family comets have conditions favourable to produce meteoroids that can encounter earth in present times ( although comets from other families could have favourable conditions , in terms of the right combination of @xmath6 and @xmath4 , to produce meteor phenomena during their distant past or future ) .",

    "[ drd - fig](b ) shows the change to @xmath58 at all @xmath10 due to each ejection velocity component ; these plots are virtually identical for all marsden family members .",
    "[ drd - fig](b ) shows that the transverse component @xmath51 is most effective in changing the nodal distance so that it can come near 1 au . for values of @xmath10 where @xmath51 is ineffective , both @xmath50 and @xmath52 can be significant ( fig .",
    "[ drd - fig](b ) ) , although @xmath52 is most effective near aphelion where normal meteoroid ejection is not expected .",
    "earlier works ( seargent 2002 ; ohtsuka , nakano & yoshikawa 2003 ; sekanina & chodas 2005 ; jenniskens 2006 ; jenniskens , duckworth & grigsby 2012 ) have proposed that the marsden family could be linked to the daytime arietids ( 171 ari , iau - mdc ) .",
    "our calculations show that marsden family members typically need ejection velocities of at least a few hundred m s@xmath0 so that @xmath61 1 au .",
    "the number of large meteoroids ( diameters @xmath62 1 mm ) having high ejection velocities of several hundred m s@xmath0 ( required to bring their nodes close to earth s orbit in this case ) will be quite small ( cf.discussion in section 3 ) .",
    "this could be an explanation if the zenithal hourly rate of visually observed arietids is indeed low , at about 12 meteors / hour ( jenniskens et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "our analysis specifically shows that ejection speeds of some hundreds of m s@xmath0 from most marsden family sungrazers can produce meteoroids whose descending node is at 1 au .",
    "this accords with the proposed association with 171 ari which has @xmath30 2030 , similar to the marsden family ( cf .",
    "equation 6 ) .",
    "long term evolution to induce a substantial @xmath6 separation is not required .",
    "various marsden family members in the dataset we used had perihelion passages during 19962008 , a range that can easily arise in the short term ( even a single revolution ) . in the short term , the nodal distances @xmath58 remain in the range resulting from the ejection velocities .",
    "however orbital changes due e.g.  to planetary perturbations would be substantial during long term evolution , over which different points in the @xmath6 precession cycle may be reached .",
    "previous works ( ohtsuka et al .  2003 ;",
    "sekanina & chodas 2005 ) have found that the kracht group ( @xmath63 ) could be linked to the marsden family and 171 ari during their long term evolution .",
    "sekanina & chodas ( 2005 ) identified a possible connection between the southern @xmath64 aquariids ( 005 sda ) which have @xmath65(meteor shower at ascending node ; equation 5 ) and the marsden and kracht groups .",
    "the nominal orbital periods of most marsden sungrazers are very high ( @xmath66 yr ) because @xmath56 1 .",
    "hence we have not checked the orbital evolution of meteoroids for subsequent revolutions . at the upper end of this period range , long term future predictions for meteor showers from this family would even require a completely independent analysis including other effects due to perturbations from galactic tides or passing stars .",
    "the same limitation applies for the long term evolution of meteoroids from ison where original @xmath67 au@xmath0 ( iau - mpc ) and newton s comet where @xmath68 au ( jpl horizons ) as well .",
    "the accuracy of conventional long term predictions ( usually applied to jupiter family and halley type comets ) of meteor showers without considering these additional effects will be questionable when orbital periods are very high ( which applies to most sungrazers ) .    a similar analysis ( as for ison and marsden family )",
    "was done on the orbits of other sungrazing families ( mentioned in table [ family ] ) .",
    "our calculations clearly show that no realistic ejection velocities in any direction can bring the nodes of meteoroids close to earth s orbit , @xmath69 and @xmath33 for all these cases ( during present times ) remaining small compared to 1 au .",
    "the necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition to create meteor showers on earth as an immediate result of particles ejected from high @xmath3 sungrazers is that their orbits lie in a favourable range in @xmath6 thereby enabling the ascending or descending node to closely approach earth s orbit . the forthcoming sungrazing comet c/2012 s1 ( ison ) has @xmath70 .",
    "although this is unusually ( for sungrazers ) very close to the ideal condition of @xmath55 1 au , which would occur if @xmath30 348 , the descending node nevertheless does not extend to the earth s orbit ( @xmath55 0.76 au when @xmath71 ) .",
    "even quite high ejection velocities do not bring meteoroids to intersect the earth s orbit ( @xmath72 0.91 au for 1 km s@xmath0 ejection ) .",
    "this implies the absence of strong meteor activity from this comet .    compiled observational records of sungrazers ( marsden & williams 2008 ) reveal only marsden family comets with @xmath6 lying in this favourable range .",
    "the other sungrazing families have @xmath6 far from this small range during present epochs and their nodes can not reach near earth .",
    "this explains why we hardly see any prominent meteor activity from the frequently observed sungrazers of different groups .",
    "surprisingly out of all observed sungrazing family members , none of them have their orbital elements such that small meteoroid ejection velocities ( @xmath73 m s@xmath0 ) lead to meteor phenomena on earth ( even the marsden family typically requiring some hundreds of m s@xmath0 ) .",
    "it would be interesting to repeat these calculations for the sungrazers which are going to visit us in future and check whether any of them have an apt combination of orbital elements so as to become an exception from this general trend so far .",
    "furthermore , calculations along these lines can help for forecasting potential meteor showers on venus especially because venus is closer to the sun compared to earth ( see small nodal distances in table [ orbels ] , particularly c/2012 s1 having @xmath58 close to the venusian semi - major axis of 0.72 au ) .",
    "hence much smaller ejection velocities could induce sufficient nodal dispersion in meteoroids to reach near the orbit of venus .",
    "this idea gives much scope for future work using similar techniques .",
    "we appreciate the referee s thoughtful and helpful review .",
