    "entanglement is the basic resource of quantum information processing@xcite . as such it has to be quantified and its structure characterized . for entanglement quantification one uses special classes of entanglement measures which are real - valued functions on the states .",
    "pure and mixed state entanglement and its quantification in its bipartite form is a well - understood phenomenon .",
    "moreover , on the geometry and structure of entangled states associated with such systems a large number of interesting results is available@xcite .",
    "for example for pure states of bipartite systems the classification of different entanglement types is effected by the schmidt decomposition . if the schmidt decomposition is known , from the schmidt numbers one can form the von - neumann entropy@xcite as a good measure characterizing bipartite entanglement . for quantifying mixed state entanglement no such general method exists .",
    "for the special case of two qubits as a measure of entanglement we have the celebrated formula of hill and wootters@xcite for the bipartite _ concurrence _ @xmath1 and the associated entanglement of formation .",
    "the structure of this measure of entanglement was studied in many different papers@xcite .",
    "its structure has been related to antilinear operators@xcite , combs and filters@xcite , and has also been generalized to rebits@xcite .",
    "explicit expressions for different special classes of density matrices and a comparison with other measures of entanglement has been given@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we would like to study the structure of special @xmath0 parameter families of two - qubit density matrices for which the the mixed state concurrences can be calculated in a closed form .",
    "such density matrices can be regarded as reduced ones coming from some larger system with special properties . in order to motivate our choice for this larger system",
    "we consider an example .",
    "if we consider a three - qubit state @xmath2 , then after calculating any of the reduced density matrices e.g. @xmath3 we are left with a two - qubit density matrix of very special structure .",
    "for example in this case @xmath4 is of rank two , and this observation enables an explicit calculation of the mixed state concurrence in terms of the amplitudes of the three - qubit state @xmath5 .",
    "this result forms the basis of further important developments namely the derivation of the coffman - kundu - wootters relation of distributed entanglement@xcite .",
    "proceeding by analogy we expect that four - qubit states of special structure might provide us with further interesting examples of that kind .",
    "let us consider a four - qubit state @xmath6 .",
    "a class of two - qubit density matrices arises after forming the reduced density matrices like @xmath7 . however , density matrices of that kind are still too general to have a characteristic structure .",
    "hence as an extra constraint we impose an antisymmetry condition on the amplitudes of @xmath8 as @xmath9 i.e. we impose antisymmetry in the first and second _ pairs _ of indices .",
    "an alternative ( and more physical ) way is the one of imposing such constraints on the original hilbert space @xmath10 which renders to have a tensor product structure on one of its six dimensional subspaces @xmath11 of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 refers to antisymmetrization . as we know",
    "quantum tensor product structures are observable - induced@xcite , hence in order to specify our system with a tensor product structure of eq .",
    "( [ tps ] ) we have to specify the experimentally accessible interactions and measurements that account for the admissible operations we can perform on our system .",
    "for example we can realize our system as a pair of fermions with four single particle states where a part of the admissible operations are local unitary transformations of the form @xmath14 taken together with eq .",
    "( [ anti ] ) this transformation rule clearly indicates that the first and the second and the third and fourth subsystems form two _ indistinguishable _ subsystems of fermionic type .",

    "we can alternatively coin the term that these density matrices are ones with _",
    "fermionic purifications_.    the organization of the paper is as follows . in section ii .",
    "we present our parametrized family of density matrices we wish to study . using suitable local unitary transformations we transform this family to a canonical form . in section iii . based on these results",
    "we calculate the wootters concurrence the negativity and the purity .",
    "we give a formula for the upper bound of negativity for a given concurrence .",
    "( we prove it in appendix a. ) in section iv .",
    "we analyze the structure of these quantities and discuss how they are related to each other . in particular we prove that the relevant entanglement measures associated with our four - qubit state satisfy the generalized coffman - kundu - wootters inequality of distributed entanglement@xcite . for the residual tangle we derive an explicit formula , containing two from the four algebraically independent four - qubit invariants . in section v. we investigate the bures geometry of this special subclass of two - qubit density matrices .",
    "we show that thanks to our purifications being fermionic an explicit formula for the bures metric with hyperbolic structure can be obtained .",
