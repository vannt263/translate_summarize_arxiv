    "at present , neutrino oscillations , together with cosmological evidence for dark matter and dark energy , present the only evidence for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "thus , models accommodating neutrino masses become an important component in the search for new physics and it is therefore fundamental to seek experimental answers to questions such as whether neutrinos are dirac or majorana fermions . in this context ,",
    "one of the most promising types of experiments is that of searching for neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath0  decay ) , in which a peak at the endpoint of the beta radiation energy is searched for , see  @xcite for reviews .",
    "since this process is lepton number violating , its observation would imply that neutrinos are majorana fermions  @xcite .",
    "present bounds on @xmath0  decay for different nuclei have been set by the heidelberg - moscow  @xcite , igex  @xcite , cuoricino  @xcite , nemo  @xcite , elegant  @xcite , solotvina  @xcite and dama  @xcite collaborations , as well as geochemical measurements  @xcite . in the next few years , experiments like gerda  @xcite , exo  @xcite , sno+",
    "@xcite and cuore  @xcite will search for a @xmath0  decay signal with unprecedented sensitivity .",
    "furthermore , there are several other experiments proposed for the upcoming future , which include candles  @xcite , super - nemo  @xcite , majorana  @xcite , next  @xcite , carvel  @xcite , cobra  @xcite , dcba  @xcite , moon  @xcite and xmass  @xcite .",
    "apart from the ongoing searches , there is a claim for a @xmath0  decay signal from ( part of ) the heidelberg - moscow collaboration @xcite .",
    "however , this measurement is in apparent conflict with other bounds on neutrino masses , in particular those coming from the influence of neutrino masses in cosmology @xcite .    among the more popular models for neutrino masses , we find the different types of seesaw mechanisms . in the type - i",
    "seesaw @xcite , the sm is extended by the addition of extra fermion singlets .",
    "the majorana masses of such singlets do not violate gauge invariance and are presently not constrained .",
    "however , a very heavy mass is usually assumed and a yukawa coupling between the singlets and the sm neutrino fields of the same order of magnitude as the sm yukawas is introduced .",
    "such a scenario provides a natural realization of small neutrino masses even if other possibilities , _",
    "e.g. _ , approximate lepton number conservation @xcite , exist .    in the current literature on @xmath0  decay , it is common to study the effects of the sm neutrinos or the extra states introduced to account for their masses independently ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . however , the interplay between both contributions , when combined , displays interesting phenomenology such as cancellations in certain regimes that is otherwise lost . by considering these contributions independent , the presence of some extra component to the majorana neutrino mass different from the extra states and some degree of fine tuning is implicitly assumed .    in the present work",
    ", we will compute the nuclear matrix element ( nme ) involved in the @xmath0  decay rate without any assumption on the neutrino mass mediating the process , describing in detail the approximations involved .",
    "the uncertainties associated to each of these approximations are also discussed , so as to estimate the total uncertainty on the final nme .",
    "the results of this computation are publicly available at ref .",
    "we will also discuss in detail the interplay between the contributions of the sm neutrinos and the extra states in seesaw models and discuss under which conditions they can be considered independent . in doing",
    "so we will cover the full parameter space and deduce what implications can actually be inferred on the models from observations .",
    "finally , we will also comment on how the contribution of extra states with different mass scales could allow for a large @xmath0  decay rate even in presence of more stringent bounds on neutrino masses , such as those derived from cosmology .",
    "in particular , it will be shown that the heidelberg - moscow claim requires a tuning of only about 50  % amongst the extra contributions in order to be compatible with the present cosmology bounds .",
    "the remainder of this work is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : nmecomp ] , we review the physics and assumptions used to compute the nmes and perform these calculations in order to get their values as functions of the mass of the exchanged fermions .",

    "[ sec : models ] before we summarize and give our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "the @xmath0  decay is mediated by the weak hamiltonian : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the leptonic current , which consists of the electron coupled to left handed electron neutrino .",
    "the neutrino can be written as a linear combination of the light and heavy mass eigenstates @xmath4 given by the mixing matrix @xmath5 : @xmath6 on the other hand , the hadronic ( nuclear ) current @xmath7 can be obtained phenomenologically by imposing symmetry requirements to the more general combination that can be built with the available lorentz vectors @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the neutron and proton four - momenta and the spin matrices , respectively .",
    "we also need to assume the impulse approximation , _",
    "i.e. _ , that nucleons in nuclei can be treated as free when dealing with the weak interaction . then imposing lorentz , parity and time - reversal invariance",

    "i.e. _ , it turns a neutron into a proton .",
    "the form factors , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are real functions of the lorentz scalar @xmath21 .",
    "their values at zero - momentum transfer are known as the vector , magnetic , axial and pseudoscalar coupling constants , respectively .",
    "note that in single @xmath22 and two - neutrino @xmath23 decays only the vector and axial terms are usually considered , due to the small transferred momenta ( @xmath24 mev ) .",
    "the magnetic and pseudoscalar couplings can be written in terms of the vector and axial ones by assuming the conserved vector current ( cvc ) and the partially conserved axial current ( pcac ) hypotheses @xcite .",
    "the cvc hypothesis also implies that @xmath25 in the nuclear medium .",

    "note that nucleon operators present in the nucleon fields from now on will be included in the nuclear wavefunctions .    the momentum dependence of the couplings is usually parametrized by the standard dipolar form @xcite , and takes into account that nucleons are not point particles but finite size bodies , _",
    "i.e. _ , the nucleon structure . since in @xmath0  decay the neutrino is being exchanged in t - channel and the outgoing electrons have essentially the same energy , the energy exchange can be neglected and thus @xmath37 .",
    "then , the form factors look like @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the pion mass and @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote the proton and neutron anomalous magnetic moments , respectively .",
    "the values of the cutoffs of the vector and axial nucleon form factors , @xmath42 gev and @xmath43 gev , are taken from experimental observations  @xcite .",
    "their effect is to weaken the couplings for large momentum transfers , _ i.e. _ , they avoid contributions arising from nucleons being too close to one another .",
    "these form factors are commonly denoted as the finite nuclear size ( fns ) terms .    with this hamiltonian",
    "the rate of the @xmath0  decay can be calculated by using the second order fermi s golden rule  @xcite : @xmath44 where the transition amplitude is given by @xmath45 the operator @xmath46 is included to fulfill antisymmetry for the electrons , whose energies are denoted by @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "the energy of the virtual neutrino @xmath49 is denoted by @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is the energy of the virtual intermediate nuclear state @xmath52 .    the leptonic part of the numerator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ronu ] ) can be written more explicitly as @xmath53 this term turns out to be proportional to the neutrino masses @xmath54 because of the left handed character of both leptonic currents .",
    "the transition amplitude is then @xmath55 the axial coupling @xmath56 , the electron mass @xmath57 and the nuclear radius @xmath58 have been introduced for convenience and to make the second line in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ronu_2 ] ) dimensionless .",
    "for the nuclear radius we have taken @xmath59  fm . using energy conservation",
    ", we have also rewritten the denominator using the new parameter @xmath60 which gives the relative energy of the ( virtual ) state of the intermediate nucleus with respect to the mean energy of the initial and final states .",
    "typical values of this parameter for the different decays are @xmath61  mev  @xcite .    in the following , two approximations will be made :    * closure approximation .",
    "* approximation of @xmath62 final states and electrons emitted in @xmath32-wave .",
    "the first of these takes advantage of the high momentum of the virtual neutrino @xmath63  mev .",
    "this nuclear scale comes from the integral over the transferred momentum of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ronu_2 ] ) . for light neutrinos ,",
    "the integrand of this equation is approximately proportional to @xmath64 in radial coordinates .",
    "hence , momenta @xmath65  10  mev will be disfavoured in the transition .",
    "in addition , if we recall the form of the fns terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_q ] ) , we see that transferred momenta above the cutoffs @xmath66 gev will be suppressed as well . on the other hand ,",
    "the leading contribution of the exponential term will arise when @xmath67 .",
    "since nucleons are typically few fermis ( femtometers ) apart in nuclei , the nuclear wavefunctions will select the preferred momentum for the virtual neutrino to be @xmath63  mev .",
    "thus , we would expect it to be the typical virtual neutrino momentum of the decay .",
    "this result has been confirmed by explicit calculation  @xcite .    in the case of heavy neutrinos , the transition operator will now have stronger preference for larger momenta @xmath68 , since @xmath69 appears in the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ronu_2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the tendency of the nuclear interaction for @xmath63  mev can be overcome resulting in large transferred momenta that would imply internucleonic distances much shorter than @xmath70  fm .",
    "again , such a distance is very suppressed by taking the fns terms into account , _",
    "i.e. _ , the nucleon structure information . hence , in these cases",
    ", the reduction due to the fns effects is very large so that we end up with a @xmath71 value of a few hundreds of mev at most , which is also the expected value for a process taking place between nucleons in nuclei .    in any case",
    ", the term @xmath72 , which can amount up to a couple of mev and vanishes on average , can be safely neglected .",
    "moreover , the intermediate state energies @xmath73 , which can differ from one another by a few mev , can also be replaced by an average value @xmath74 .",
    "thus , only a common parameter @xmath75 is required  @xcite . with the removal of the dependence on the actual energy of the intermediate states",
    ", it follows that they are no longer needed in the calculation , since the closure relation can be applied .",
    "thus , the hadronic part in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ronu_2 ] ) is now @xmath76 this closure approximation has been shown to be correct to more than 90  % , using the quasiparticle random phase approximation method @xcite , to be presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : wf ] .",
    "as for the limitation of our study to transitions to @xmath77 final states , and to cases where electrons are emitted in @xmath32-wave , corrections are expected to be of the order of 1  % at most . in the case of @xmath31-waves , they are suppressed to @xmath32-waves by an order of magnitude at least @xcite . moreover , since they have odd - parity , they need odd - parity terms in the current to couple to a @xmath78 final state and these only appear at @xmath79 , see note on eq .",
    "( [ eq : j_norel ] ) .",
    "thus , in the end we have a contribution of the order of 1  % of the leading ones .",
    "on the other hand , since all the final nuclei of @xmath0  decay have even number of both protons and neutrons , their ground states are always @xmath77 .",
    "any transition to an excited final state will be suppressed by a phase space factor , which in this case is approximately proportional to @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the energy available for the decay . considering this factor ,",
    "the only other low - lying final states of interest are @xmath82 excited states .",
    "moreover , apart from the phase space suppression , these final states also need electron @xmath31-waves due to angular momentum coupling , since two electron @xmath32-waves can only couple to angular momentum 0 or 1 . hence , these transitions can also be safely neglected .    within these approximations",
    ", the transition amplitude can be written as @xmath83 where the index contractions and the @xmath84 and @xmath85 integrations have been performed .",
    "the operator @xmath86 is the result of the product of the nuclear currents given in eqs .",

    "( [ eq : j_mu ] ) ] from which they originate : @xmath90 their explicit form can be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "it was in this work that the importance of the non leading terms [ _ i.e. _ , all but @xmath91 and @xmath92 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_xx ] ) ] was first shown .",
    "they are referred to as higher order components of the nuclear current ( hoc ) .",
    "notice that , since these terms are of orders @xmath93 and @xmath94 in the current , and @xmath95 come at order @xmath94 .",
    "the reason to keep these second order terms is the enhancement of the coupling constants @xmath96 and @xmath97 due to the factors @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_q ] ) . in each of these terms the corresponding factor appears squared . ]",
    "their contribution will be enhanced for larger transferred momentum , _ i.e. _ , for heavy neutrinos .",
    "it is easy to insert @xmath100 into eq .",

    "the fermi functions also depend on the nuclear radius @xmath58 and their explicit form is @xmath107 the quantity @xmath108 is the nuclear matrix element , which takes into account the initial and final nuclear wavefunctions and the transition operator .",
    "this operator originates from both the nuclear currents and the virtual neutrino .",
    "the nme is given by @xmath109 when the integral over @xmath30 is performed , we obtain @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the distance between the decaying neutrons and the @xmath112 are the so - called neutrino potentials . before the radial integration over @xmath71 they are given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 are the spherical bessel functions .",
    "as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : nme ] ) , a key ingredient in the calculation of the nmes are the wavefunctions of the initial and final nuclei .",
    "this is a complicated nuclear structure problem which can not be solved in the complete space , _ i.e. _ , taking into account all neutrons and protons of the corresponding nucleus in all their possible configurations .",
    "thus , truncated valence spaces and effective interactions are used to solve the nuclear many body problem . as a consequence of this",
    ", a fully consistent treatment would demand regularizing the @xmath0  decay operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nme ] ) using the same prescription as for the bare nuclear interaction  @xcite .",
    "this has only been performed very recently @xcite .    instead",
    ", we will simplify the problem keeping the bare @xmath0  decay operator and including new correlations [ called short range correlations ( src ) ] in the calculation via a general prescription .",
    "the findings of refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite show that for light neutrinos , the effect of these correlations is rather moderate once fns terms have been taken into account , of the order of 5% correction to the nme . in order to implement these",
    "src one needs to assume some prescription and the most commonly used are either a jastrow - type function @xcite or a unitary correlation operator method ( ucom ) transformation @xcite .",
    "the nme is thus transformed as @xmath115 where @xmath5 is either a jastrow - type function or a ucom transformation .",
    "the actual parametrizations can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively",
    ". in our calculations have used the ucom prescription , even though similar results are expected within the jastrow approach . note that these src terms , which do not have much importance for light neutrinos , will be more relevant for heavy ones , which require shorter distances between the decaying nucleons .    mainly two different methods are used to obtain the nmes for the @xmath0  decay , the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) @xcite and the interacting shell model ( ism ) @xcite .",
    "the qrpa includes relatively large valence spaces but is not able to comprise all the possible configurations . on the other hand ,",
    "the ism is limited to smaller configuration spaces , but all possible correlations within the space can be included .",
    "when comparing the nmes obtained by both methods a clear disagreement is found , the ism values being about 1.5 - 2 times smaller than qrpa ones @xcite .",
    "this disagreement is not overcome when taking into account the estimated errors of both calculations and it is under discussion whether the difference is mainly due to the lack of correlations of qrpa calculations ( which reduce the value of the nme ) , the small valence space used in the ism ( to be discussed in section  [ sec : error ] ) or both @xcite .",
    "however , it must be stressed that due to the theoretical effort made over the last years this disagreement is now much less severe than it was five years ago , and studies using recently available experimental information for the decay of @xmath116ge suggest that the present situation can be improved @xcite .",
    "this applies to nmes obtained with light neutrino exchange . in the heavy neutrino case ,",
    "since the available qrpa results are rather outdated @xcite , it is probably not meaningful to compare them with those of the present work .",
    "however , the same relation between ism and qrpa results of the light neutrino case is to be expected , since the difference between these methods lies on the calculation of the wavefunctions , and therefore it should not be very much dependent on changes on the transition operator , for whom both methods give an equivalent description @xcite .    in this work",

    "full diagonalizations are accomplished within different valence spaces and effective interactions .",

    ", the results obtained will have some uncertainties , which we will now estimate .",
    "first of all , when dealing with the ism , we have to worry about the valence space and the effective interaction used to obtain the nuclear wavefunctions .",
    "the effect of having larger valence spaces was analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the result that the nmes increased , within a conservative analysis , by @xmath132 .",
    "the same number was obtained in a qrpa calculation when it was quantified the effect of the orbits absent in a ism valence space @xcite . of the three valence spaces employed in the present work ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : wf ] ) , only that corresponding to the @xmath117ca decay was not explored in ref .",
    "@xcite , so that we can consider the former @xmath132 increase as a general estimate of the uncertainty due to the configuration space . as for the nuclear interaction , a moderate dependence of @xmath133 was found both in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "since they study nuclei in different regions and we can consider all the effective interactions employed of similar accuracy , we will also take this figure as general .    until recently ,",
    "another considerable source of uncertainty were the src .",
    "however , it now seems that their contribution is rather small and that proper ucom or jastrow - type parametrizations can take these terms very well into account , with a precision of @xmath134  @xcite . for its part ,",
    "the variation in the nme due to different but reasonable values of the cutoffs appearing in the fns terms @xcite is also very small , less than 5  % .",
    "in addition , due to the fact that the nmes have been calculated using the closure approximation , we have to include an additional error of @xmath135 to our results , as suggested by qrpa calculations @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with the very soft variation that is seen in the nme as the parameter @xmath136 is modified .",
    "furthermore , we quantify the possible effect of missing terms in the operator ( next order terms in the current , nucleon recoil , @xmath31-wave emitted electrons ) by an additional uncertainty of less than 5  % in our results .",
    "it is currently under discussion whether the axial coupling should be quenched or not  @xcite . in the ism calculations presented here we take @xmath137 , _",
    "i.e. _ , we do not quench it , contrary to what is required by the single @xmath22 and two - neutrino @xmath23 decays , where a pure gamow - teller operator appears and its value has to be quenched to @xmath138 .",
    "however , in the @xmath0  decay case the operator is more involved due to the extra radial dependence introduced by the virtual neutrino . moreover , in the case of the pure gamow - teller @xmath139 channel , it is not dominant in the @xmath0  process , and depending on its relative sign , quenching it may result even in an enhancement of the nme .",
    "until this issue is explored in more detail , we will take the most conservative option , allowing for a full quenching of the axial coupling and also for the quenching only of the @xmath139 channel . under these assumptions , taking into account that the fermi part of the nme accounts for 10 - 15% of the full nme in our ism calculations and is never quenched , we estimate a @xmath140 error due to this effect .",
    "notice that the uncertainty in the valence space only moves the estimate up , the effect of axial quenching essentially moves it down , while the remaining contributions are expected to be gaussian - distributed . even though some of these errors may be correlated in a rather complicated way , as a first approximation we will take them as independent .",
    "altogether , adding every contribution in quadrature we expect an overall uncertainty in the final nme of @xmath141 .",
    "the above analysis applies to the case of light neutrino exchange . for heavy neutrinos",
    ", the nmes get very dependent on the src and fns treatments . in this case , a similar study to the one above gives a 15 - 20% for src uncertainties and",
    "10% for fns ones , which would lead to a final @xmath142 uncertainty .",
    "however , one should take this number cautiously until the accuracy of the fns approach for such heavy exchanged particles is firmly established @xcite .",
    "as an example , we will consider the case of the @xmath116ge decay . in ref .",
    "@xcite the nme was obtained with different effective interactions and src , obtaining the interval @xmath143 .",
    "if we take into account the further uncertainties of the valence space , the fns , the closure approximation , the next order hadronic current terms and the @xmath144 quenching , we end up with @xmath145 .",
    "this result will be used in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] to derive bounds on the neutrino masses from the @xmath0  decay process .",
    "according to eq .  ( [ eq : t-1_rep ] ) , the contribution of a single neutrino to the amplitude of @xmath0  decay is given by @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the mass of the propagating neutrino and @xmath148 is the nuclear matrix element that characterizes the process and depends on the nucleus that undergoes the @xmath0  transition .",
    "figure  [ fig : nme ] shows two distinct regions where the behaviour of the nme as a function of the neutrino mass changes from almost constant up to @xmath149  mev to decreasing quadratically as the neutrino mass increases beyond @xmath150  mev .",
    "this behaviour is easily understood : the neutrino can be characterized as _ light _ if @xmath151 or _ heavy _ if @xmath152 , which would mean that the neutrino propagator in the nme would be dominated by @xmath21 or @xmath153 , respectively , where @xmath31 is the momentum exchanged in the process . as already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : nme ] , in the @xmath0  decay @xmath154 .",
    "we will therefore define two regimes :    * * the light neutrino regime : * for @xmath155  mev , where the neutrino propagator is @xmath156 and hence , the nme is maximum in this regime and is almost independent of the neutrino mass : @xmath157 .",

    "however , since the @xmath0 transition does not occur through an @xmath32-channel type diagram , the characteristic momentum transfer has @xmath162 with @xmath163 .",
    "thus , the nuclear matrix element does not exhibit a resonant mass and the transition between the light and heavy neutrino mass regimes is relatively smooth ( _ c.f .",

    "however , in mixed seesaw models , the situation can instead resemble that of the type - i with states in both regimes and thus be used to reconcile large @xmath0  decay rates with cosmological bounds .    in conclusion , the contribution to @xmath0  decay from the light active neutrinos can be forecasted by combining present and future neutrino oscillation data on the neutrino mixing and mass hierarchy with probes of the absolute neutrino mass scale such as cosmology .",
    "these predictions can be compared to future @xmath0  decay searches so as to gain information on the origin and nature of the neutrino masses . in this comparison",
    ", we can distinguish the following scenarios :    * * the @xmath1 process is observed to be in agreement with the forecasted rates .",
    "* this indicates that the light active neutrinos dominate the @xmath0  decay rate .",
    "since new degrees of freedom are in any event required to give the light neutrinos majorana masses , this implies that there is necessarily new physics above the nuclear scale , so that its contribution is suppressed . * * the @xmath1 process is observed to be smaller than the forecasted rates .",
    "* this means that there is a partial cancellation between the active and extra neutrino contributions .",
    "sterile neutrinos around the nuclear scale are then necessary .",
    "a higher mass would imply too big a suppression through their nme to show any sizable cancellation , while too small masses would make the gim - like cancellation exact . * * the @xmath1 process is observed to be larger than the forecasted rates . * in this situation the light active neutrinos can not dominate the @xmath0  decay rate .",
    "extra sterile neutrinos , lighter or around the nuclear scale , could have a significant contribution and reconcile the observations .",
    "however , the gim - like cancellation between both contributions has to be avoided .",
    "this implies either a cancellation between extra neutrinos both above and below the nuclear scale ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : heavylight ] ) or between the extra neutrinos and a type - ii or iii seesaw contribution ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : mix ] ) .",
    "this is the case that would correspond to a confirmation of the heidelberg - moscow claim . * * the @xmath1 process is not observed but was forecasted . *",
    "while this could imply that neutrinos are dirac and not majorana particles , it can also be the case that neutrinos are majorana but extra sterile neutrinos below the nuclear scale are present .",
    "thus , the gim - like cancellation takes place and the @xmath0  decay rate becomes unobservable . *",
    "* the @xmath1 process is not observed and was not forecasted . *",
    "this is the most pessimistic scenario since it is impossible to draw any conclusion on the nature and origin of neutrino masses .",
    "we are specially indebted to andrea donini for carefully reading through this paper and providing valuable comments .",
