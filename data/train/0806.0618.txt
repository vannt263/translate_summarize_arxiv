    "it has been established that every massive , local spheroid harbours a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) in its centre whose mass is proportional to that of its host ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the black holes ( bhs ) and their surrounding galaxies were formed synchronously .",
    "this hypothesis has found support from hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation , which use feedback from winds and outflows from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) to link the growth of the smbh to that of its host ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus these models support a picture , first presented by @xcite , where a starburst - dominated ultra - luminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) , arising from a merger , evolves first into an obscured qso and then into an unobscured qso , before finally becoming a passive spheroid .",
    "the high - redshift population of ulirgs in this proposed evolutionary cycle are the submillimetre ( submm ) galaxies ( smgs ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these systems have ulirg - like bolometric luminosities , @xmath14l@xmath5 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and they have many of the properties expected for gas - rich mergers ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this population evolves rapidly out to a peak at @xmath15 , crudely matching the evolution of qsos @xcite and providing additional circumstantial evidence for a link between smbh growth and spheroids .",
    "two further results have shed light on the evolutionary link between smgs and qsos .",
    "firstly , a modest fraction of optically luminous qsos at @xmath16 are detected in the submm / mm ( @xmath17% ; @xcite ) showing that the qso- and smg - phases do not overlap significantly , given the lifetime estimates of the two populations ( qsos make up @xmath18% of flux - limited samples of smgs ; @xcite ) .",
    "but when a qso _ is _ detected in the submm / mm then it could to be in the transition phase from an smg to an unobscured qso , making its properties a powerful probe of the evolutionary cycle ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , the evolutionary state of the smbhs within smgs can also be judged using the 2-ms _ chandra _ deep field north observations @xcite to derive accurate agn luminosities and hence lower limits on the bh masses ( @xmath19 ) in those smgs with precise redshifts in this region ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these studies suggest that the agn in typical smgs are growing almost continuously  but that the smbhs in these galaxies appear to be several times less massive than seen in comparably massive galaxies at @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "together these results argue for a fast transition from a star - formation - dominated smg - phase to the agn - dominated qso - phase @xcite .",
    "the latter phase will result in the rapid bh growth necessary to account for the present - day relation between spheroid and smbh masses ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "_ can we confirm this and more generally test the proposed evolutionary link between smgs and qsos at the peak of their activity at @xmath16 ? _",
    "this evolutionary cycle has been tested in the local universe by comparing the properties of qsos and ulirgs ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , both of these populations are @xmath21 less abundant in the local universe than they were at the era of their peak activity at @xmath22 and so we have to be cautious about extrapolating from local examples to the high - redshift progenitors of the bulk of today s massive spheroids ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . thus , to properly test the validity of this cycle for typical spheroids we have to compare qsos and ulirgs at the era where their populations peaked : @xmath22 .",
    "the critical pieces of information needed to test the link between smgs and qsos are the relative dynamical , gas and smbh masses of these two populations . in principle",
    "the dynamical masses can be derived from optical or near - infrared observations of emission line gas in the smgs or qsos ( see @xcite ) . however , there is the problem of removing the qso emission in these observations , as well as the effects of dust obscuration and outflows .",
    "in contrast , molecular co emission line profiles are relatively immune to the effects of obscuration and outflows , while at the same time yielding additional constraints on the relationship between qsos and smgs from their gas masses .",
    "there is currently a lack of sensitive co observations of qsos at @xmath233 , with data published on only eight sources ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "instead the focus has been on co studies of qsos at @xmath24 ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , although these qsos have little overlap with the redshift range where smgs are typically detected .",
    "the paucity of co constraints for @xmath25 qsos also reflects the difficulty in determining their systemic redshifts with sufficient precision to guarantee that the co emission falls within the bandwidth of typical millimetre ( mm ) correlators .",
    "however , sensitive near - infrared spectroscopy of the civ , mgii , and [ oiii]5007 emission lines in qsos can provide redshifts with required precision as well as h@xmath26 or h@xmath27 fluxes and line widths to yield @xmath19 estimates ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have carried out a quantitative test of the proposed link between smgs and qsos at @xmath16 where both populations are most common .",
    "we have obtained precise systemic redshifts from near - infrared spectroscopy of potential transition qsos ( i.e.  submm / mm - detected qsos ) and then used the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) to search for co emission .",
    "we relate their dynamical , gas and smbh masses to smgs from the pdbi co survey @xcite .",
    "we test : a ) whether the cold gas masses in these qsos are similar to those in smgs ; b ) whether the line widths and dynamical masses of these two populations are comparable ; and c ) how the ratio of smbh to dynamical masses for these submm - detected qsos relate to the estimates for smgs and those for optically luminous qsos ( which lie on the present - day @xmath19@xmath28 relation ; @xcite ) .",
    "together these observations can constrain the proposed evolutionary sequence which links qsos to the formation of massive young galaxies and smbhs at high redshift .",
    "we describe the sample selection , observations and data reduction in  [ obsdr ] .",
    "the results of the near - infrared and mm co spectra are given in  [ results ] .",
    "the co properties of the submm - detected qsos are compared and contrasted with smgs in  [ discuss ] , and we discuss the evolutionary status of the submm - detected qsos in  [ evolution ] .",
    "our conclusions are given in ",
    "[ concl ] .",
    "we adopt cosmological parameters from the _ wmap _ fits in @xcite : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31kms@xmath32mpc@xmath32 .",
    "all quoted magnitudes are on the vega system .",
    "the objective of this study is to test the link between smgs and qsos at the era where these populations peaked .",
    "we have therefore selected radio - quiet qsos with a redshift distribution matched to smgs ( @xmath33 , @xcite ) and with @xmath34 fluxes @xmath35mjy .",
    "the @xmath36mjy flux limit selects comparatively bright qsos and smgs and is imposed so that the sources would be sufficiently bright to be detected in co. we choose submm - detected qsos from three main samples : we select five qsos from a submm photometry survey of optically - bright qsos by @xcite  hs1002 + 4400 , j140955.5 + 562827 , j154359.3 + 535903 , hs1611 + 4719 , and j164914.9 + 530316 , we select two qsos from the submm photometry survey of x - ray absorbed qsos by @xcite  rxj121803.82 + 470854.6 and rxj124913.86055906.2 , and finally we include two qsos found in blank - field submm surveys by @xcite and @xcite , smmj131222.35 + 423814.1 and mmj163655 + 4059 , respectively , and smmj123716.01 + 620323.3 , an optically - selected qso targetted in submm photometry mode by @xcite .",
    "the final sample comprises 10 submm - detected qsos with similar fluxes to the smg sample ( @xcite ; @xmath35mjy at 850@xmath0 m , assuming 850@xmath0m/1.2 mm colours typical of smgs ; @xcite ) , with a median of 10mjy .",
    "the seds of these qsos demonstrate that the bulk of the mm / submm luminosity arises from dust emission and is very likely associated with star formation , rather than an agn ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "we now compare the co properties of the submm - detected qsos with smgs . in order to fairly compare the smg and qso samples , we have discarded three strongly lensed galaxies from the co - observed smg sample from @xcite that would not have been detected with @xmath35mjy at 850@xmath0 m .",
    "these would lie below our sample flux limit except for the boost from the lensing magnification , and they thus probe an intrinsically fainter population .",
    "this leaves a sample of 17 smgs ( of which 11 are co - detected ) from @xcite with a median observed 850@xmath42 m flux of 8.2mjy .",
    "we compare median values of the gas masses , co linewidths , sfes , m@xmath43 , and m@xmath44/m@xmath45 .",
    "the error bars on these median values represent the spread of values , and have been obtained by taking the standard deviation of the median values from 50 trials of randomly drawing out the appropriate number of values out of each population with replacement .",
    "we note that the dominant uncertainties in @xmath46 , @xmath41 , and @xmath47 are likely the assumed co - to - gas conversion factor , the assumed @xmath27 and @xmath48 in the sed fitting , and the assumed co radius and inclination angle , respectively , and have not been included in each error budget , although the relative @xmath46 , @xmath41 , and @xmath47 in our samples will be correct if the same assumptions hold for all our smgs and submm - detected qsos .      the median gas mass of our co - detected qsos is @xmath49m@xmath50 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gas ] ) .",
    "this is similar to the median gas mass of the comparison sample of 11 co - detected smgs ( m@xmath51m@xmath50 ) . including the upper limits from the co - undetected objects in each sample yields median gas masses of @xmath52 and @xmath53m@xmath50 for submm - detected qsos and smgs , respectively .",
    "not surprisingly , we find that the gas mass distributions of both samples are statistically indistinguishable at the present sample sizes , as we show below .",
    "given the moderate fraction of non - detections in both samples , we employ survival analysis ( see e.g.  @xcite ) to estimate the intrinsic distributions of the gas masses of submm - bright smgs and qsos .",
    "this includes the detections _ and _ upper limits , assuming that the data are censored at random ( i.e.  that the chance of only a gas upper limit being available for an object is independent of the true value of the gas mass ) .",
    "given the current detection limit and small dynamic range in our sample , there is no strong apparent trend with the selection criteria ( i.e.  with submm flux ) versus whether a particular source is detected or not , and thus the assumption of the data being randomly censored seems reasonable .",
    "we employ the widely - used product - limit avni estimator ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) to construct a maximum - likelihood - type reconstruction of the true distribution of gas masses in the qso and smg samples ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gas ] ) .",
    "we now test whether or not our censored samples of smg and qso gas masses are likely to have been drawn from the same distribution using the non - parametric gehan test , following @xcite . the gehan statistic yields @xmath54 ( equivalent to @xmath55 ) , revealing that the difference between the gas mass distributions for smgs and qsos is about 35% likely due to chance .",
    "we consider 35% to be a high value , and therefore conclude that the gas masses of our qso sample are indistinguishable from that of the smg sample at the same epoch of @xmath223 for the high mass end ( where we are the most sensitive ) .    within our qso sample",
    "we find a broad similarity in the star formation efficiency of the co - detected and undetected qsos ( see   [ lfircalc ] ) , assuming conservatively that the co - undetected subset lies just below the detection threshold . a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test reveals a @xmath56 chance that the two subsamples are drawn from the same parent population , indicating that we have not detected a statistically significant difference in the sfe between the co - detected and undetected qsos in our small sample given the current detection limits .",
    "what is the cause then of a given submm - detected qso in our sample , which all have similar @xmath41 , being either co - detected versus co - undetected ?",
    "a possible explanation could be that the co - detected submm - detected qsos are physically larger and contain proportionally more massive co reservoirs than the co - undetected qsos , although time - dependent star formation , differences in the seds or filling factors could also be causes for the scatter in the @xmath41@xmath57 correlation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sfe ] ) .    locally , l@xmath58 increases with l@xmath59 for ( u)lirgs , with the @xcite sample of smgs extending this trend out to the highest far - infrared luminosities ( @xmath60l@xmath50 ) . for comparison , in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfe ] we have plotted our qsos on the l@xmath58l@xmath59 diagram along with lirgs , ulirgs and smgs . the co - observed smgs and qsos seem to lie along the relation within the considerable uncertainties in their far - infrared luminosities , suggesting that the smgs and qsos are undergoing similar star formation modes , despite the qsos hosting luminous agn activity .    to quantify this we compare the sfe of the qsos to the smgs , where @xmath41 for the smgs has been calculated using the method outlined in  [ lfircalc ] and",
    "their @xmath57 are taken from @xcite . as fig .",
    "[ fig : sfe ] shows , the smgs appear to have similar sfe with respect to qsos on average , although this probably reflects the similar submm flux selection criteria .",
    "given that the median @xmath41 and @xmath46 of the qso and smg samples are similar , @xmath61l@xmath50 and @xmath62l@xmath50 and @xmath52m@xmath50 and @xmath53m@xmath50 ( including all co - detected and -undetected qsos and smgs ) , respectively , the sfes are also similar : medians of @xmath63 and @xmath64l@xmath65 , for qsos and smgs respectively .",
    "we perform a gehan test on these censored data sets and find @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) , revealing that the difference between the distribution of sfe in smgs and qsos is about 15% likely due to chance , indicating that we have not detected a significant difference in the sfe between our small samples of smgs and qsos .      a comparison between the observed co line profiles of smgs and qsos requires care as we know that there is an inherent difference in the types of lines seen in smgs versus qsos : five of the 11 smgs detected in co in our comparison sample show hints of double - peaked profiles ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , while none of our qso co emission lines appear double - peaked ( which is perhaps not surprising given our small sample size and low snr data ) . these double - peaked profiles could indicate merger activity ( as likely for smgs from high - resolution observations ) , or a rotating gas disk / ring ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in both cases , measuring the separation between the peaks is a more appropriate measure of the dynamics of the merger or rotating disk system than the fwhm of the individual peaks",
    ".    in cases",
    "where double - peaked profiles are present we need to fit two gaussian profiles simultaneously in order to derive the velocity offsets of the peaks .",
    "we have therefore refit all of the smgs and qsos with single and double gaussian profiles using the @xmath68 statistic as a measure of the goodness - of - fit .",
    "we find that 4/11 of the co - detected smgs are better fit at the @xmath69 level with a double gaussian profile over a single gaussian profile @xcite .",
    "none of the submm - detected qsos are significantly better fit by double gaussian profiles , although we note that the random chance of drawing six single peaked profiles ( with replacement ) out of a sample containing seven single - peaked and four double - peaked profiles ( i.e.  the smg sample above ) is 7 percent .",
    "the fact that the qso profiles appear to be single - peaked could indicate that our data are too low snr to detect double - peaked profiles ( especially for a merger , where both the width and peak strength of the lines can be different ) , or that we are viewing the qsos almost face - on@xmath70 ( similar to those found for double - peaked smgs ) and equal line fluxes and shift them to a velocity separation such that the fwhm of a single - gaussian profile fit is @xmath71 ( our qso sample median fwhm ) , yielding typical velocity separations of 300@xmath72 .",
    "this translates into a conservative limit on the inclination of the system of @xmath73 by using the relation @xmath74 and taking @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( the latter value is what is observed typically for smgs by fitting double gaussian profiles ) . ] if the co is contained in a disk , or that they are at a late stage of a merger , or that they are not in the course of a merger .    for our six submm - detected qsos",
    "we compare the co fwhms and dynamical masses with the co - detected sub - sample of 11 smgs taken from the literature ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the median fwhm of the six co - detected qsos and seven single - gaussian profile fit smgs are @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "when we include the double gaussian profile fits in the median estimate , taking the separation between the peaks as a proxy for the dynamics of the system , the median for the smgs slightly decreases to @xmath79 .",
    "we have plotted the histogram of the submm - detected qso and smg line widths for comparison in fig .",
    "[ fig : fwhm ] ( c.f .  fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the co fwhm of qsos and smgs appear to be similar . to quantify this we use a standard two - sided ks test which reveals a 95% probability that the two distributions are drawn from the same parent population ( this drops to 77% if only the single - line gaussian profile smgs are used ) .",
    "this is in stark contrast with @xcite , who find only a 0.9% probability for an inhomogeneous sample of 12 smgs and 15 qsos from a literature compilation ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , we note that they have used the smg single - gaussian profile fit line widths even in cases where clearly double - peaked co profiles are apparent , leading to artificially broad fwhm in these cases . their analysis is also based on a mixed sample over a wide redshift range and includes strongly lensed sources . also , the qsos studied here have larger linewidths than have been reported for other qsos and they are also those with the lowest snrs and thus the most difficult to fit .",
    "therefore the differences in our results for @xmath22 qsos and those in @xcite for higher redshift qsos can probably mainly be attributed to the small sample sizes involved and the somewhat different approaches ( rather than a real statistically significant effect ) when all possible sources of error are taken into account .",
    "since the co line widths of smgs and qsos are similar , it may follow that the dynamical masses of smgs and qsos are also similar .",
    "the uncertainties in this are if the gas is distributed similarly in both populations ( i.e.  either a disk or merger scenario ) , if their sizes ( @xmath37 ) are the same , and if their average inclination angles ( @xmath80 ) are similar .",
    "@xmath81kpc is believed to be appropriate for the gas distribution in smgs ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "one of our qsos , j140955.5 , has been observed at pdbi by @xcite in co(76 ) with a @xmath82 resolution and was unresolved , giving an upper limit to the gas reservoir of 5kpc ( though this could be too high a j transition to trace the bulk of the gas reservoir ) .",
    "no sizes have been measured for our sample of qsos , although the co emission seems to be confined to a compact region in other samples of high - z qso @xcite as inferred by comparing a range of co line ratios ( see also @xcite who observe gas distributed over a 2.5kpc radius and @xcite ) .",
    "this agrees with the recent results from @xcite who find that co emission in a @xmath83 qso is unresolved with a beam size of @xmath84arcsec , implying that the molecular gas is contained within a compact region with a radius of @xmath85kpc .",
    "the qso from @xcite was observed in a high j transition , co(54 ) , and one might worry that such high transitions might not trace the bulk of the reservoir .",
    "co(10 ) and ( 21 ) observations of other @xmath24 qsos ( e.g.  @xcite ) have confirmed that the high j transitions do trace the bulk of the reservoir , and thus provide good size constraints ( this is in contrast to what is observed in most nearby galaxies ) .",
    "spatially resolved observations exist for local qsos , albeit the data are sparse : @xcite measure a @xmath86kpc disk in mrk 231 ; @xcite find a @xmath86kpc ring - like molecular gas distribution ; and @xcite estimate @xmath87kpc for the co emission in a low luminosity qso . therefore , assuming 23kpc radius regions will probably still be reasonable once these galaxies are resolved .",
    "while the average orientation of the smgs is likely to be close to the value expected for random orientations , @xmath88 , since they are not prone to orientation selection effects ( see @xcite ) , the submm - detected qsos could be orientated preferentially with respect to the sky plane due to their selection as optically luminous qsos in the first place .",
    "we find evidence for this from a comparison of the [ oiii ] line width ( see table  [ tab : nir ] ) , a proxy for the measure of the stellar velocity dispersion ( supporting the idea that the narrow - line region gas is in orbital motion in the gravitational potential well of the bulge ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , with the co line width .",
    "we find that the [ oiii ] fwhm are a median factor of @xmath89 broader than the co line profiles ( with a large scatter ; ratios range from 0.64.3 ) , suggesting indeed that inclination effects could be important in the co line widths of qsos ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of the double - peaked co profiles in the submm - detected qsos could be interpreted as a later phase of a merger in the typical proposed evolutionary sequence , with smgs representing an earlier phase of the merger .",
    "we also know that at least two of our qsos must have @xmath90 ( alternatively the assumed standard co - to - h@xmath91 conversion factor could be too high or else the assumed 2kpc radius is too small ) or else the cold gas mass estimates exceed the dynamical masses ( even given the large error bars ; see table  [ tab : derived ] ) .",
    "conversely , some of our broadest co line detections suggest that their inclination angles might be larger than @xmath92 .",
    "other constraints come from the obscured : unobscured agn ratio ( @xmath9310 ) for a sample of smgs , where @xcite suggest that qsos could be seen close to the line of sight ( @xmath94@xmath95 ) .",
    "we thus adopt the best available estimates of the average inclination angles for smgs and qsos of @xmath96 and @xmath92 , respectively , in calculating the dynamical masses below .",
    "high - resolution co observations could help to place tighter constraints on the inclination angles of our systems .    assuming a 2kpc radius and an average inclination angle of @xmath92 for the submm - detected qsos and @xmath96 for the smgs",
    ", we find median dynamical masses , m@xmath97 , of m@xmath98kpc@xmath99 and @xmath100m@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "this results in gas - to - dynamical mass fractions of @xmath101% and 30% for qso and smg populations , respectively .",
    "the gas mass accounts for a significant fraction of the dynamical mass of both classes , indicating that the host galaxies are at an early evolutionary stage .",
    "we place a constraint on the spheroid mass by taking the dynamical mass estimate from ",
    "[ fwhm_discuss ] , assuming @xmath102 and a spheroid radius of 2kpc or less ( as we assumed for the co emission ) , yielding a median spheroid mass of @xmath103m@xmath5 . in principle one should subtract the gas and bh masses , although we note that doing so makes a negligible difference in general , given the large error bars on @xmath47 , and we also have an additional complication that two of our co - detected qsos have @xmath104 .",
    "other uncertainties to our @xmath105 estimates include the possibility that the cold gas in submm - detected qsos is more widely distributed ( e.g.  due to entrainment in outflows ) than we have assumed here ( @xmath106kpc ) , which would mean that all of our dynamical ( and hence spheroidal ) masses have been underestimated .",
    "similarly , if the spheroid is significantly more extended than the co emission then the spheroid masses will be larger .",
    "for example , assuming a characteristic radius of @xmath107kpc for the spheroid would result in an increase in the mass of a factor of @xmath108 times .    based on these assumptions",
    "we estimate @xmath109 for our qso sample .",
    "this is approximately an order of magnitude larger than the local ratio of @xmath110 for the bhs in local spheroids ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . thus our co survey of @xmath16 qsos appears to support the claim that @xmath8 for @xmath25 agn is higher than observed locally ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our @xmath8 ratio could be made to match the local relation by either decreasing the inclination angles to @xmath111 or by adopting a spheroid extent ten times larger than we have assumed .",
    "our results and those of @xcite suggest that bh growth may occur more rapidly than spheroid formation in qsos at @xmath16 ( although both studies could be prone to strong selection effects ; see @xcite ) .",
    "similar co - based studies of rarer individual qsos at higher redshifts also support this conclusion ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this result contrasts strongly with the @xmath8 claimed for smgs , which lie just below the local ratio ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] ; @xcite ) . however , as mentioned in  [ smbhmasses ] , six out of nine of our submm - detected qsos have very massive bhs ( @xmath112m@xmath5 ) which are far more massive than those inferred for typical smgs ( @xcite ; @xmath113m@xmath5 ) and would place them among the largest known masses for local bhs .",
    "they are therefore likely to be considerably rarer than typical smgs . to make a fairer comparison between smgs and submm - detected qsos we need to focus on those co - detected submm - detected qsos with @xmath19 more similar to that found for smgs .",
    "we have three submm - detected qsos in our sample with bhs more similar to those of smgs , unfortunately two of these are undetected in co , so we can not determine their dynamical masses .",
    "nevertheless , the one example with a marginal co detection , smmj131222.35 , has an implied spheroid mass of @xmath114m@xmath5 ( assuming @xmath102 ) and hence @xmath115 .",
    "this is an order of magnitude below the ratio for the more optically luminous qsos and places smmj131222.35 approximately on the local relation ( fig .",

    "we adapt the proposed evolutionary pathway of @xcite and so test the scenario where the smg population evolves through a submm - detected qso phase , into a submm - undetected qso and finally a passive elliptical .",
    "now we ask  are the observed properties of the smgs and submm - detected qsos consistent with their observed gas depletion , amount of bh growth , and space densities required to link them in this evolutionary sequence ?    to provide a characteristic timescale for our discussion we first determine the lifetime of the submm - detected qso phase .",
    "we assume that the far - infrared luminosities of the submm - detected qsos arise from dust - obscured star formation and that the molecular gas reservoirs we detect via their co emission are the fuel for this star formation . in this way",
    "we determine that the qsos have enough cold gas to sustain their current episode of star formation ( assuming a star formation efficiency of 100% ) for @xmath117m@xmath118m@xmath119myr .",
    "@xmath120 is on the order of a couple of dynamical times within our assumed co radius of 2kpc ( @xmath121myr ) , which could be defined as a ` maximal starburst ' ( e.g.  @xcite ) as is commonly found with other populations of starburst galaxies such as ulirgs at low - redshift and smgs and other qsos at high-@xmath122 .",
    "since we are most likely catching the qsos halfway through the current star formation episode , we infer a submm - detected qso phase lifetime of @xmath123myr .",
    "the reader should of course note that @xmath120 and our estimated lifetime are both lower limits if @xmath41 includes a significant contribution from agn activity , or if the starburst is discontinuous , or if the imf is more top heavy than salpeter s imf , or if the gas reservoirs contain significant masses of sub - thermal gas @xcite , or if the co reservoir is widely distributed on scales @xmath124kpc ( not that there is any evidence that such galaxies exist ) . next we note that in our submm - detected qso sample co is typically detected in only the optically luminous qsos ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : selection ] ) , i.e.  those qsos with the most massive bhs ( @xmath125m@xmath5 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : dave ] ) . as we discussed in  [ bulge ] these bhs are much more massive than found in typical smgs  is it feasible for the bhs to grow sufficiently between these two phases ? in fig .",
    "[ fig : dave ] we plot @xmath46 as a function of @xmath19 for our sample of submm - detected qsos and for an ` average ' smg ( @xmath19 from @xcite and @xmath46 from @xcite ) .",
    "we indicate gas consumption and bh growth evolutionary tracks for the average smg on timescales of 10 and 20myr , assuming a sfr of 1000m@xmath5yr@xmath32 and eddington - limited bh growth .",
    "[ fig : dave ] demonstrates that an smg could evolve into a submm - detected qso with @xmath116m@xmath5 and @xmath126m@xmath5 ( the median @xmath46 of the co - undetected qsos ) in a reasonable timescale , whereas an average smg would need substantially ( @xmath13 times ) more gas and more time ( @xmath127 ) to evolve into the optically luminous submm - detected qsos in our sample with @xmath128m@xmath5 and @xmath129m@xmath5 .",
    "the gas consumption and bh growth timescales suggest that the optically luminous submm - detected qsos in our sample can not be the direct descendents of typical smgs .",
    "indeed the co - detected optically luminous qsos in our sample are extremely luminous agn ( @xmath130 , @xcite ) with @xmath125m@xmath5 and will most likely evolve into the most massive elliptical galaxies found in local rich clusters .",
    "these qsos are so rare ( @xmath131 over all redshifts ; @xcite ) that they are unlikely to be associated with _ any _ known smgs , since @xmath132mjy smgs at @xmath1333 have much higher surface densities ( @xmath134 ; @xcite ) or space densities ( @xmath135mpc@xmath136 ; @xcite ) .",
    "even correcting for the relative timescales of the two phases still leaves an order of magnitude difference in the space densities .",
    "based on the relative number or space densities , these optically luminous submm - detected qsos are unlikely to be involved in the smg / qso evolutionary sequence we are interested in testing .    in contrast , the less luminous submm - detected qsos appear to be consistent with the @xcite proposed evolutionary sequence , linking them to typical smgs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dave ] ) .",
    "thus we concentrate on the three submm - detected qsos ( including one marginal co detection and two upper limits : smmj131222.35 , smmj123716.01 and mmj163655 ) with bhs more similar to that of smgs of @xmath116m@xmath5 .",
    "the median gas mass and sfr of this subsample are @xmath137m@xmath50 and 850m@xmath138 , respectively .",
    "hence , these systems can sustain their current star formation episode for @xmath139myr or a total lifetime of the submm - detected qso phase of @xmath140myrs .",
    "this estimate of the lifetime of submm - detected qsos can then be used to relate them to smgs as follows .",
    "the incidence of blank - field submm sources identified with qsos is @xmath18% @xcite . in our test scenario",
    "this is the fraction of an smg lifetime in which it appears as an submm - detected qso .",
    "conversely , about 1525% of optically luminous qsos are detected in the submm @xcite .",
    "assuming that all bright smgs go through a qso phase , and that all qsos are formed via smgs and there is no strong mass or luminosity dependence of their lifetimes , then these relative fractions imply that the total qso lifetime ( i.e.  submm - detected plus submm - undetected ) is about @xmath141times shorter than the average lifetime of an smg . taking our estimated lifetime of less luminous submm - detected qsos , @xmath140myrs ,",
    "these detection fractions imply total lifetimes for qsos of @xmath142myrs and for smgs @xmath143myrs .",
    "these estimates are consistent with independent estimates of the lifetimes for qsos of @xmath14440myr ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and @xmath145300myr for smgs from modelling @xcite .",
    "there are two other observational links between these qsos with @xmath146 ( @xmath147m@xmath5 ) and smgs .",
    "firstly , the qsos have space densities at @xmath16 some 510 times lower than smgs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this ratio of volume densities is roughly consistent with the ratio of the relative smg and qso lifetime , @xmath145300myrs and @xmath14840myrs , of @xmath108 times .",
    "moreover , in  [ bulge ] we found a hint that this subset of our submm - detected qsos lies on the present - day @xmath8 relation and similar to smgs , which is consistent with them being ` transition objects ' between smgs and qsos in the proposed evolutionary sequence in which they would eventually evolve into passively evolving spheroids .    although this conclusion is based on a small sample of qsos ,",
    "if the dynamical and gas properties of these three qsos are representative of this subset of submm - detected qsos , then our results are consistent with @xmath149 , @xmath116m@xmath5 submm - detected qsos being ` transition objects ' in the proposed evolutionary sequence , representing a very brief prodigious star formation phase where the bh is undergoing rapid growth synchronously with the stellar mass .",
    "submm - detected qsos do not possess sufficiently large gas reservoirs ( containing less gas than smgs on average ) to sustain the implied sfrs for very long , providing a possible explanation for why some of our submm - detected qsos are undetected in co ( a single weak co detection and two non - detections of @xmath116m@xmath5 submm - detected qsos ) .",
    "where do the optically luminous submm - detected qsos fit into this evolutionary scheme ?",
    "the average smg would need @xmath150gyr ( more than its lifetime ) in order to grow their bhs by the required factor of @xmath151 to host a @xmath152m@xmath5 bh seen in the optically luminous subset of submm - detected qsos .",
    "in addition , these smgs would need to begin with gas reservoirs containing @xmath153m@xmath5 in order to leave luminous qsos with detectable reservoirs of residual gas .",
    "alternatively , these rare optically - luminous qsos could be periodically ` repeating ' smgs , with smg progenitors with @xmath154 and a surface density of @xmath155 , which are consuming their gas and growing their bhs synchronously , but which accumulate additional bh mass and gas through merging with other smgs in dense environments ( i.e.  damp ` dry merging ' ; e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , we currently have not observed any smgs with such large gas masses , and given their rarity , we will require large scale submm blank - field surveys such as those planned with scuba-2 to find these potential progenitor smgs .",
    "hence our current results split the submm - detected qsos in our survey into two categories ( although a bigger sample would probably give a continuous trend ) :    \\(1 ) our observations of the optically luminous submm - detected qsos indicate they have @xmath156 .",
    "it is very difficult to grow the bhs in typical smgs to such large masses in the typical lifetimes of smgs or submm - detected qsos .",
    "we therefore suggest that these qsos can not be related to the evolutionary cycle of typical smgs . instead , these intrinsically rare qsos most likely evolve from an equally rare subset of the smg population ",
    "whose surface density is low enough that it has yet to be detected in current small - area submm surveys .",
    "simply based upon the masses of their bhs , it is clear that these systems can only evolve into the most massive elliptical galaxies found in local rich clusters .",
    "\\(2 ) we have found a subset of our submm - detected qsos with lower optical luminosities which have gas and bh masses and space densities which are consistent with them being potential ` transition objects ' in the proposed evolutionary scenario where smgs evolve into qsos .",
    "this subset of submm - detected qsos have @xmath157 and gas consumption timescales consistent with a phase of prodigious star formation where the bh has grown substantially during the preceding @xmath158 smg phase .",
    "the fast build up of the stellar population is consistent with an evolutionary path ending in a population of present - day massive spheroids , where homogeneous old stellar populations are seen @xcite .",
    "we have carried out a millimetre interferometry survey of nine submm - detected qsos at @xmath12.6 in order to test the link between smgs and qsos at the era where these two important populations were most numerous .",
    "we include in our analysis comparable observations of a similarly selected qso from the literature to provide a final sample of ten submm - detected qsos . to support this survey we obtained near - infrared spectroscopy of these qsos to derive accurate systemic redshifts needed to tune the millimetre receivers to the correct frequencies .",
    "the near - infrared spectra also provide h@xmath26 fluxes and line widths needed to derive reliable bh mass estimates for the qsos .",
    "our main findings are :    \\(1 ) we detect co emission from six of the ten submm - detected qsos in our sample , confirming that they contain a significant amount of molecular gas and that a large fraction of the mm emission is from starbursts .",
    "the median gas mass of our sample ( including non - detections ) is @xmath159m@xmath5 , similar to that found for @xmath16 smgs and to @xmath24 qsos .",
    "the star formation efficiencies of our qsos are also comparable to those measured for smgs , @xmath63l@xmath65 , suggesting that the gross properties of the star formation in the qsos are like those seen in smgs . adopting a 2kpc scale size for the gas distribution in the qsos and a typical inclination of 20@xmath160",
    "we derive a median dynamical mass of m@xmath98kpc@xmath161m@xmath5 , similar to smgs ( assuming an inclination angle appropriate for random inclinations ) .",
    "we find a lower incidence of double - peaked co line profiles in the qsos , compared to smgs , which we believe results from a selection bias towards lower average inclination angles for the qsos .",
    "\\(2 ) our near - infrared spectroscopy indicates a median black hole mass in our qso sample of @xmath162m@xmath5 .",
    "combined with our dynamical estimates of the spheroid mass , these yield @xmath163 .",
    "this @xmath8 ratio for this sample of submm - detected qsos at @xmath7 is an order of magnitude larger than the local ratio , although @xmath105 suffers from large uncertainties due to the unknown co radii and inclination angles .",
    "this ratio is also significantly above that seen for smgs at @xmath16 .",
    "however , this comparison masks a broad range in bh masses within our qso sample and so we split the sample into two subsets based on their bh masses .",
    "( 3 ) looking at the optically luminous submm - detected qsos in our sample we find that we detect co emission in 5/6 of these qsos .",
    "however , the estimated bh masses for these qsos , @xmath16410@xmath4m@xmath50 , are too large ( and their number densities too small ) for them to be related to typical smgs in a simple evolutionary cycle .",
    "we propose that the progenitors of these most massive qsos are a rare subset of smgs with @xmath165m@xmath5 with a number density of @xmath155 which will be possible to detect with future scuba-2 surveys .",
    "\\(4 ) for the optically less luminous ( @xmath149 ) submm - detected qsos , we marginally detect one source in co and obtain sensitive limits for three further qsos .",
    "the bh masses for these systems are @xmath116m@xmath5 , similar to the estimates for bhs in smgs .",
    "these submm - detected qsos are consistent with being ` transition ' objects between smgs and submm - undetected qsos , as we show it is feasible to link their bh masses to those of smgs by eddington limited growth for a period comparable to the gas depletion timescale of the qsos , @xmath107myrs .",
    "the space density of these qsos is also in rough agreement with that expected for the descendents of smgs given current estimates of the relative lifetimes of qsos and smgs .",
    "we conclude that these @xmath149 , @xmath166m@xmath5 submm - detected qsos are consistent with being in a very brief prodigious star formation phase , and that they simply do not possess sufficiently large gas reservoirs to sustain the sfr ( which is why these might be less often detected in co ) , although a larger sample of co observations of submm - detected qsos with these bh masses is required for confirmation .",
    "to make further progress on understanding the evolutionary links between smgs and qsos requires a larger survey of the submm and co emission from typical qsos ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "in addition , measurements of other co transitions for the submm - detected qsos ( e.g.  from iram 30-m , alma , evla , and ska ) are required to place better constraints on the temperature and density of the molecular gas and thus provide a more accurate determination of the line luminosity ratios and hence total gas masses of these systems .",
    "similarly , higher resolution co observations are essential to put strong constraints on the reservoir sizes and inclination angles , and hence @xmath47 , needed to compare the two populations .",
    "finally , better measurements of the far - infrared seds ( with saboca , scuba-2 or _ herschel _ ) will yield more accurate measures of @xmath41 and @xmath167 for submm - detected qsos to constrain the contribution from an agn component .",

    "<S> we have used the iram plateau de bure millimeter interferometer and the ukirt 15@xmath0 m imager spectrometer ( uist ) to test the connection between the major phases of spheroid growth and nuclear accretion by mapping co emission in nine submillimetre - detected qsos at @xmath12.6 with black hole ( bh ) masses derived from near - infrared spectroscopy . when combined with one qso obtained from the literature </S>",
    "<S> , we present sensitive co(32 ) or co(21 ) observations of 10 submillimetre - detected qsos selected at the epoch of peak activity in both qsos and submillimetre ( submm ) galaxies ( smgs ) . </S>",
    "<S> co is detected in 5/6 very optically luminous ( @xmath2 ) submm - detected qsos with bh masses @xmath310@xmath4m@xmath5 , confirming the presence of large gas reservoirs of @xmath6m@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> our bh masses and dynamical mass constraints on the host spheroids suggest , at face value , that these optically luminous qsos at @xmath7 lie about an order of magnitude above the local bh - spheroid relation , @xmath8 , although this result is dependent on the size and inclination of the co - emitting region . however , we find that their bh masses are @xmath9 times too large and their surface density is @xmath10 times too small to be related to typical smgs in an evolutionary sequence . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , we measure weaker co emission in four fainter ( @xmath11 ) submm - detected qsos with properties , bh masses ( @xmath12m@xmath5 ) , and surface densities similar to smgs . </S>",
    "<S> these qsos appear to lie near the local @xmath8 relation , making them plausible ` transition objects ' in the proposed evolutionary sequence linking qsos to the formation of massive young galaxies and bhs at high - redshift . </S>",
    "<S> we show that smgs have a higher incidence of bimodal co line profiles than seen in our qso sample , which we interpret as an effect of their relative inclinations , with the qsos seen more face - on . finally , we find that the gas masses of the four fainter submm - detected qsos imply that their star formation episodes could be sustained for @xmath13myr , and are consistent with representing a phase in the formation of massive galaxies which overlaps a preceding smg starburst phase , before subsequently evolving into a population of present - day massive ellipticals .    </S>",
