    "we ran the fitting programs twice , with the equivalent hydrogen column density first left as a free parameter and next , frozen to the galactic value of @xmath59 ( bonamente et al .",
    "we found , however , that allowing @xmath60 to vary resulted in its being poorly  constrained in most of the model fits , with fitted values sometimes significantly below galactic .",
    "while the presence of the lower values could be a reflection of the models being unable to fully describe the average spectrum , it could also be due to uncertainty in the correction to the acis quantum efficiency at low energies .",

    "( 1996 ) estimated @xmath65  kev over the _ rosat _ energy range of @xmath66  kev within a @xmath67  arcmin radius .",
    "the model that seems to best fit the average cluster spectrum ( still with @xmath68 for 353 degrees of freedom ) needs a combination of two mekal components .",
    "fit temperatures for the cool and hot thermal components are @xmath69  kev and @xmath70  kev , respectively .",
    "the temperature for the cooler mekal component is comparable to that derived from deprojection analysis of the total spectrum by stewart et al .",

    "the chemical abundance , assumed to be identical for both the mekal components , is @xmath76 solar , similar to that determined by the single - temperature mekal fit .",
    "for this two  mekal model , the total unabsorbed flux ( @xmath38  kev ) is @xmath77  erg  @xmath78  s@xmath26 , with a little less than one half contributed by the soft component .",
    "this model computes temperatures and abundance that are virtually unchanged regardless of whether @xmath60 is fixed or free to vary .      to estimate the radial variations in temperature , metallicity , pressure , and electron density , we extracted x  ray spectra in concentric , circular annuli starting from the optical center of the bcg .",
    "since the overall cluster emission is nearly circular , and as we assume spherical symmetry in deprojection , circular annuli are a reasonable choice .",
    "as we show in   [ sec : knotspec ] , the soft x  ray knots in the cluster core have a spectrum that is different from their surroundings .",
    "so , in estimating the radial dependence of the spectral parameters , we excised the knotty region from annuli inside about @xmath8  arcsec . in the deprojection ( see below ) , we accounted for the volume missing due to these excised regions .",

    "we initially allowed the equivalent hydrogen column density , along with the temperature , metallicity , and normalization to vary freely in the fitting process .",
    "the best - fitting absorption value for many of the annuli was , as in the case of the global spectrum (   [ sec : avgspec ] ) , close to or below the galactic value .",
    "it is unlikely that there is an actual decrement in the galactic @xmath60 along the line of sight of a1991 . to avoid complications in interpreting further results",
    ", we performed spectral fits with the value of absorption frozen at the galactic value . in projection , the inner annuli to approximately 15  arcsec of the cluster center are not very well fitted with a single  temperature mekal model ( average reduced @xmath53 of @xmath80 for about 90 degrees of freedom )",
    "however , the simple mekal model does represent the spectra reasonably well at larger radii .",
    "we also performed deprojection of the spectra to account for contributions from the outer regions of the cluster to its inner regions .",
    "the deprojection algorithm first fits an absorbed single - temperature mekal model to the spectrum of the outermost annulus .",
    "it then works inwards , fitting to each annulus a mekal model in addition to a weighted combination of the best ",
    "fit models of all the annuli exterior to it .",
    "the weights given to the spectra of the outer annuli are commensurate with the volume contributions of the total outer annuli to the current one .",
    "note that we make no allowance for the fact that the outermost annulus also has contribution from cluster emission outside it ; therefore , the fluctuations in the deprojected quantities for the outer one or two rings are not to be considered physical .",
    "we also found that the spectrum of the innermost approximately @xmath81  arcsec of the cluster was unstable in deprojection due to the displacement of the centroid and the peak of the x - ray emission from the chosen center .",

    "figure  [ fig : knotspec ] shows a representative spectrum of the knots between @xmath106  kev overplotted with such an absorbed mekal model .",
    "the fits are formally satisfactory in quality , with @xmath108  d.o.f .",
    "we quote the mean value of the five sets of the best  fit parameters and the 90% confidence intervals .",
    "we find that the substructure has a temperature of @xmath110  kev and metal abundance of @xmath111 .",
    "we conclude that the knots are cooler than their surroundings ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : temp_abun_prof ] ) , as also evidenced by the comparison of the soft and hard x  ray images in fig .",
    "[ fig : knot_soft_hard ] .",
    "the total @xmath106  kev flux is @xmath112  s@xmath26 , where the error represents the @xmath99 deviation of the five measurements .",
    "we estimated the volume emission measure for the knots using the mean of the mekal model fit normalizations . from this and the mean knot temperature ,",
    "we derive the gas density and pressure of the knots .",
    "we compute the volume of the knots assuming the structure is an ellipsoid with the line  of  sight radius equal to the semi  minor axis of the ellipse . for semi  major and semi  minor axes of @xmath113 and @xmath114  arcsec , respectively , the knotty structure occupies @xmath115 .",
    "then , the lower limit on the projected average gas density within this volume , computed assuming the filling factor is unity , is @xmath116 .",
    "the mass of this substructure , assuming a mean particle mass of @xmath117 times the proton mass , is @xmath118 , comparable to a small galaxy .",
    "the knot pressure is @xmath119 .",
    "the surrounding regions , which are about twice as hot ( at @xmath120  kev ) , have a mean density @xmath121 and gas pressure @xmath122 ( as derived from interpolating the respective deprojected quantities from sec .",
    "[ sec : nepr_prof ] ) .",
    "thus , the gas pressure in the cool knotty structure is @xmath123 times that of its surroundings .",
    "the primary source of error in our determination of the gas properties of the knots is systematic : the selection of the background region .",
    "when our annular apertures are centered on the x  ray centroid , rather than on the optical and radio co - ordinates of the cd galaxy , the background locations differ significantly from the cluster center ( i.e. , to regions of lower pressure ) on the side opposite the knots . in this instance , the ratio of the knot pressure to the surrounding pressure increases from @xmath124 to @xmath125 .",
    "this excess pressure implies a substantial peculiar velocity for the central structure , as we discuss below .",
    "the distinct character , high density , and cometary appearance of the cool , knotty structure suggest that it is moving northward through the core of the cluster .",
    "if so , we can apply the pressure ratio to estimate the peculiar speed of the structure . if gas at the stagnation point in front of the moving knots had the same properties as the gas at the same radius prior to being disturbed by the knots , then , assuming a steady flow around the knots , bernoulli s theorem gives @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the specific enthalpy of gas at the stagnation point",
    ", @xmath128 is the specific enthalpy of undisturbed gas at the same radius and @xmath129 is the speed of the knots .",
    "if the knots are subsonic , gas is compressed adiabatically as it flows to the stagnation point , so that @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the pressure at the stagnation point and @xmath132 the pressure of the undisturbed gas . also , @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the temperature and @xmath135 the sound speed of the undisturbed gas , so that bernoulli s theorem may be written @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the mach number of the knots .",
    "if the pressure at the stagnation point equals the pressure in the knots , using the pressure ratio @xmath138 determined above , this gives the mach number of the knots as @xmath139 .",
    "the mach number corresponding to the maximum pressure ratio , @xmath140 , is @xmath141 .",
    "the allowed range includes @xmath142 , so that the knots could also be at rest in the icm , although the appearance of the substructure suggests otherwise .",
    "we conclude , then , that the knots are almost certainly moving through the core of the cluster at a substantial fraction of the sound speed .",
    "the appearance of the cool structure suggests that it may be in the final stages of breaking apart .",
    "pressure variations due to internal flow are limited to the ram pressure of the external flow , i.e. , the overpressure of the knots .",
    "since the knots are overpressured by a factor of @xmath124 , the internal pressure variations must be modest , so that the density variations must be chiefly due to entropy variations within the structure .",
    "the ion mean - free - path in the icm determined by coulomb collisions , for @xmath143 kev and @xmath144 , is @xmath145 pc , so that the reynolds number of the external flow is @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the radius of the knotty structure , and may be considerably larger if magnetic fields suppress ionic viscosity .",
    "thus it is plausible that shear instability has driven complex flow within the knotted substructure that is in the process of destroying it .",
    "dynamical instabilities and the bulk motion of the core gas relative to the rest of the cluster can also cause substructures such as edges and blobs in the icm ( see e.g. , markevitch et al .",
    "2000 ; mazzotta et al .",
    "however , the central galaxy of a1991 has no significant radial velocity offset with respect to the cluster mean ( beers et al .",
    "1991 ) , though there could be a component perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "assuming the thermal knots are presently part of the cluster but originated as a distinct entity , the x  ray derived mass , gas temperature , pressure and density of the cool structure are consistent with its being the remnant of a galaxy group that is falling into a1991 .",
    "the group would be subjected to ram ",
    "pressure stripping as it traverses the cluster , but its dense ( low  entropy ) core would survive the passage .",
    "there is a hint of a front not far from the knots which may represent the wake of the stripped gas .",
    "we have presented a new _ chandra _ observation of the a1991 galaxy cluster .",
    "we find that the gas in the central 200  kpc has an average temperature of @xmath148  kev , and an average metallicity of @xmath149 . like other cooling flow clusters , the temperature of the gas in a1991 drops in the core .",
    "the deprojected , spatially ",
    "resolved gas temperature falls from 4  kev at 100  kpc to 1.6  kev in the central 10  kpc .",
    "spectral deprojection shows that the chemical abundances are roughly constant across the central 100 kpc of the cluster .",
    "the central cooling time is @xmath150  yr , and rises to @xmath151  gyr beyond @xmath37  kpc .",
    "the mass deposition rate is about @xmath98  @xmath10 within the central 20  arcsec of the cluster .",
    "we discovered a cool central structure defined by a collection of bright x  ray knots projected @xmath5  kpc north of the nucleus of the cd galaxy .",
    "the structure has a mass of @xmath152 , and is @xmath153  kev cooler than the surrounding gas .",
    "it appears to be a small galaxy group that is breaking apart as it plunges northward through the core of the cluster at a substantial fraction of the sound speed .",
