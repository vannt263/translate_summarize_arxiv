    "<S> if the strength of the randomness is less than a critical value , @xmath0 , the system has a kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) phase transition from the paramagnetic phase to a state with quasi - long - range order . </S>",
    "<S> our data suggest that the latter exists down to @xmath1 in contradiction with theories that predict the appearance of a low - temperature reentrant phase . at the critical disorder @xmath2 and for @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> there is no quasi - ordered phase . at zero temperature </S>",
    "<S> there is a phase transition between two different glassy states at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the functional dependence of the correlation length on @xmath4 suggests that this transition corresponds to the disorder - driven unbinding of vortex pairs . </S>"
