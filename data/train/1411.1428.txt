    "the gould belt survey is a legacy programme that uses the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) to map the dust and gas distributions in nearby star forming molecular clouds ( ward - thompson 2007 ) .",
    "tilted @xmath1120 degrees from the galactic plane , the gould belt contains many of the closest low and high - mass star forming regions and ob associations .",
    "this geometry allows many of these regions to be studied at high spatial resolution , and with relatively little confusion by foreground or background galactic emission .",
    "the goal of the present study is to map the co , @xmath0co and c@xmath1o @xmath2 = 32 distributions from the ophiuchus molecular cloud .",
    "studies of other targets in the jcmt gould belt survey have already been presented : orion a ( buckle 2012 ) , orion b ( buckle 2010 ) , serpens ( graves 2010 ) , taurus ( davis 2010 ) , and in perseus ( curtis 2010 ) .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : section [ section : cloud ] describes the overall ophiuchus cloud and previous observations , section [ section : observations ] reports the observational and instrumentation characteristics , section [ section : ophcloudresults ] presents the observational data and analyses the excitation temperatures , opacities of the gas and cloud , section [ section : outflows ] determines the characteristics of the outflows and their analyses their impact on the global kinematics of the cloud , section [ clump_analysis ] gives the properties of the small scale structure ( clumplets ) across the mapped region , and section [ section : summary ] summarising the results of this study .",
    "located 120@xmath135 pc from the sun ( loinard 2008 , lombardi , lada @xmath14 alves 2008 ) , the ophiuchus cloud is one of the closest low - intermediate mass star forming regions ( motte 1998 , johnstone 2000 , padgett 2008 , miville - d@xmath15schenes 2010 ) .",
    "it is dominated by the main oph a clump , also known as ldn  ( lynds dark nebula )  1688 . the line of sight extinction a@xmath16  @xmath11  50100 mag ( wilking @xmath14 lada 1983 , khanzadyan 2004 ) .",
    "co isotopic measurements have previously been reported by white ( 1986 ) , ladd ( 2004 ) , wouterloot , brand @xmath14 henkel ( 2005 ) , minchin @xmath14 white ( 1995 ) and white @xmath14 sandell ( 1995 ) . a large atomic carbon , ci , and co map of the ophiuchus cloud has been presented by kamegai ( 2003 ) , and extensive @xmath0co measurements reported by loren ( 1989a , b , 1990 ) . other molecular line observations have included hco@xmath17 , nh@xmath18 , [ oi ] , nh@xmath18 by boogert ( 2002 ) , o@xmath19 by larsson ( 2007 ) , liseau @xmath14 justtanont ( 2009 ) , liseau ( 2012 ) and maruta ( 2010 ) , h@xmath19d@xmath17 by harju ( 2008 ) , h@xmath19o by imai ( 2007 ) , nh@xmath18 by friesen ( 2009 ) ) , ci ( kulesa 2005 ) , and in the far - ir continuum ( ceccarelli 1998 , liseau 1999a ) .",
    "a bright filament of far - ir emission traces the western edge of the molecular clump , and appears associated with an edge - on photodissociation region close to hd 147889 ( liseau 1999a ; kulesa 2005 , cassassus 2008 ) .",
    "such filamentary structures are widely recognised as being associated with star forming molecular cores ( palmerin 2013 ) .",
    "mapping of the [ ci ] and [ cii ] lines show that these lines primarily trace emission from the lower density envelopes of molecular clumps illuminated from the far side of the cloud ( kamegai 2003 ; kulesa 2005 ) .",
    "this emission follows the column density distribution of the molecular gas and is modelled as having temperatures of 50200 k , surrounded by lower temperature gas at  @xmath1120 k ( kulesa 2005 ) .",
    "the early stages of star formation can be studied by observations of the outflows and/or jets from embedded objects , usually from co or h@xmath19 imaging ( phillips 1982 , white 2000 , beckford 2008 , nakamura 2011 ) .",
    "previous surveys of the ophiuchus cloud complex at millimetre , infrared and optical wavelengths have led to the identification of a number of co molecular outflows ( loren 1989a , b , andr@xmath20 1990 , zhang @xmath14 wang 2009 , van der marel 2013 , hatchell 2012 ) , as well as individual outflows associated with irs 44 ( terebey 1989 ) ; vla  1623 ( andr@xmath20 1990 , dent 1995 ) ; gss 30 ( tamura 1990 ) ; oph b ( kamazaki 2003 ) and the elias12/vla  1623 region ( dent , matthews @xmath14 walther 1995 , narayanan @xmath14 logan 2006 , bussman 2007 ) , which are covered by the present observations .",
    "atomic jets and herbig - haro ( hh ) objects have also been discovered in the cloud ( wilking 1997 , g@xmath21mez 1998 , 2003 , phelps @xmath14 barsony 2004 , wu 2002 , smith 2005 ) .",
    "near - infrared ( h@xmath19 2.12 @xmath22 )  imaging observations have been used to identify shock - excited knots and jets located toward highly obscured areas ( davis @xmath14 eisl@xmath23ffel 1995 ; dent 1995 ; molinari 2000 ; davis 2010 ; grosso 2001 , habart 2010 , 2011 , zhang 2013 ) .",
    "@xmath24 maps of the region have been reported by lombardi , lada @xmath14 alves ( 2008 ) , and radio continuum observations by casassus ( 2008 ) and loinard ( 2007 ) .",
    "the distribution of pre - stellar clumps and ysos has been presented by ratzka ( 2005 ) , smith ( 2005 ) , young ( 2006 ) , stamatellos , whitworth @xmath14 ward - thompson ( 2007 ) , j@xmath25rgensen ( 2008 ) , enoch ( 2008 ) , padgett ( 2008 ) .",
    "the turbulent nature and motions of the gas have been studied by snow , destree @xmath14 welty ( 2008 ) , schmeja , kumar @xmath14 ferreira ( 2008 ) and friesen ( 2009 ) .",
    "the radiation field in ldn 1688 is dominated by two embedded b - type double stars , @xmath26  oph ab , which are located at a distance of @xmath27 pc , and have spectral classes b2v+b2v ( abergel 1996 , cassassus 2008 , rawlings 2013 ) .",
    "these have a combined luminosity @xmath28  =  5800  @xmath29 , with the other double system , hd 147889 at a distance of @xmath30 pc , and stars with spectral classes b2iv+b3iv and @xmath28 = 7800  @xmath29 ( rawlings 2013 ) .",
    "hd 147889 , is located 0.51 pc away from the far side of the oph a clump .",
    "the uv - field is about 1 per cent of that of the well studied orion bar ( white 2003 , liseau 1999a , b , habart 2003 , naylor 2010 , buckle 2012 , arab 2012 , bernard - salas 2012 ) .",
    "however , the interstellar dust in ophiuchus shows unusual dust extinction properties , with components due to large dust grains ( chapman 2009 ) , and very small , rapidly rotating grains ( cassasus 2008 , dickinson 2009 , castellanos 2011 ) .",
    "this dust will significantly mask uv radiation resulting from star forming activity .",
    "other early - type stars in the upper scorpius ob association may also have deposited energy into the cloud ( greene @xmath14 meyer 1995 , thompson 2004 , luhman @xmath14 rieke 1999 , ratzka , k@xmath23hler @xmath14 leinert 2005 , zavagno 2010 ) .    although most of the condensed objects appear to be relatively old t - tauri stars , at least six major areas undergoing active star - formation",
    "have been identified : oph - a to oph - f respectively , which contain many pre - stellar clumps and young stellar objects ( ysos ) ( loren , wootten , @xmath14 wilking 1990 , allen 2002 , ridge 2006 , friesen 2009 , van kempen 2009 ) . the most active star - forming part of the ophiuchus complex , ldn  1688 , contains almost half of the mass of the ophiuchus cloud , and exhibits a relatively high gas - star conversion efficiency that has been estimated to be @xmath1122 per cent ( wilking , lada @xmath14 young 1989 ) .",
    "the oph b region is the second densest clump in the ophiuchus cloud complex , containing several 1.3 mm dust continuum sources ( andr@xmath20 , ward - thompson @xmath14 barsony 1993 , motte , andr@xmath20 , @xmath14 neri 1998 , liseau , white @xmath14 larsson 1999b , j@xmath31rgensen 2008 ) , which are likely to be very young protostars .",
    "the above description has focussed on previous studies relevant to this paper , for more extensive details of other studies of the ophiuchus region , the reader is referred to the compilation by wilking , gagne @xmath14 allen ( 2008 ) .",
    "the harp ( heterodyne array receiver programme - see buckle 2009 ) receiver contains an array of 16 heterodyne detectors , arranged in a 4@xmath324 footprint on the sky . harp was used to make maps in the co , @xmath0co and c@xmath1o @xmath2 = 32 lines , where it has a beamsize of 14@xmath33 at 345 ghz ( corresponding to a linear size of 0.008 pc at the ophiuchus cloud ) .",
    "the harp receptors were operated as single sideband detectors , with system noise temperatures  @xmath11  350500 k for the various lines .",
    "the main - beam efficiency was taken from the jcmt efficiency archive , and assumed to be @xmath34 = 0.61 at 345 ghz ; with the values of the forward coupling efficiency , @xmath35 = 0.71 , 0.72 and 0.78 at 329 , 330 and 345 ghz respectivelyo , @xmath0co and co @xmath2  =  32 rest frequencies were 329.3305525 , 330.5879601 and 345.7959899 ghz respectively . ] .",
    "in general , the data presented in this paper are in units of main beam brightness temperature @xmath36 ( kutner @xmath14 ulich 1981 ) unless otherwise stated in the text , although appropriate beam efficiency corrections were made ( usually to main beam brightness temperature when discussing the compact clumps ) to estimate the properties of the gas , as discussed in later sections of this paper .    the molecular line observations were made up of 3.2 hours of co data taken in february and march 2008 and 16.6 hours of @xmath0co and c@xmath1o observations taken during march , july , and august 2008 .",
    "the maps were observed using the standard on - the - fly mapping mode , and referenced against an off - source reference position at ra(j2000 ) = 16@xmath37 38@xmath38 00.6@xmath39 , dec(j2000 ) = -25@xmath4036@xmath41 42.0@xmath33 , which had been verified to show no line emission from examination of 60 second position - switched  stare  observation in co. the co data were taken with the autocorrelation spectrometer and imaging system ( acsis ) using its 250 mhz dual sub - band mode that provided 4096 channels , each with a velocity resolution @xmath11  0.05 km s@xmath12 per channel .",
    "the @xmath0co / c@xmath1o data were taken simultaneously with each other , with each sub - band having a central rest frequency of 330.587 or 329.330 ghz respectively , providing a velocity resolution @xmath11 0.055 km s@xmath12 .",
    "all of the isotopologue maps were then further convolved to a resolution of 0.1 km s@xmath12 .    to smooth out noise variations due to missing receptors or differences in receptor performance , two independent maps were made by scanning in orthogonal directions ( a technique known as  basket - weaving  ) , which helps to mitigate scanning effects due to systematic zero level offsets between adjacent detector scans . to remove some remaining low level striping effects ,",
    "the data cubes were searched for artefacts using a 3-@xmath42 clipped image mask in each velocity channel , followed by use of a hough transform to search for residual linear features in the data that might be indicative of such scanning artefacts aligned along the array scan direction .",
    "this destriping correction typically corresponded to cosmetic changes at the @xmath11  12 per cent of the peak brightness level of the map at a given point , and did not quantitatively alter the results reported here , except in a cosmetic way .      to support the jcmt observations , a deep united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) image of the oph region",
    "was obtained using a near - ir k - band filter , and a matching narrow - band h@xmath19 image .",
    "this was used to observe the h@xmath19  2.122  @xmath22  @xmath43 = 10 @xmath44(1 ) vibrationally excited line at 2.122  @xmath22   line , which is excited in high temperature gas of several hundred up to several thousand k , and traces shocked and/or fluorescently excited material in pdrs ( white 1987 , 2000 , davis @xmath14 eisl@xmath23ffel 1995 , wilking 1997 , g@xmath21mez 1998 , dent 1995 , grosso 2001 ) .",
    "narrow band h@xmath19 images were obtained with ukirt during june 2010 using the near - ir wide - field camera wfcam .",
    "this contained four rockwell hawaii - ii ( hgcdte 2048  @xmath32  2048 ) arrays giving an effective pixel size of 0.4@xmath33 .",
    "observations at four pointing positions were dithered and mosaiced together . at each of these four positions ,",
    "eight exposures were obtained , each with 20 seconds integration time in the h@xmath19 line , and 5 seconds in the nearby k - band continuum .",
    "the images were shifted by an integral multiple of 0.2@xmath33 to give a final pixel scale of 0.2@xmath33 .",
    "the residual sky / background structure was removed by fitting a coarse surface to each image ( as described by davis 2010 ) . in the final step , the broad band k - band ( continuum )",
    "image was aligned with the same frame as the h@xmath19 exposure , scaled and subtracted . on the final image",
    "some stars appear as negative ( black ) spots ( due to imperfect subtraction ) , although regions showing diffuse emission are recovered well .",
    "many h@xmath19 emission clumps from the ophiuchus molecular hydrogen emission - line objects ( mhos ) reported by davis ( 2010 ) , that were not initially visible on the ukirt k - band continuum image , were successfully recovered using this technique , along with a number of previously uncatalogued objects .",
    "the h@xmath19 image will be used later in this paper in figures [ fig : opha_br ] , [ fig : ophb_br ] and [ fig : ophcef_br ] .",
    "for consistency throughout this paper , four kinds of cloud structure will be referred to : ` cloud ' , meaning the overall ophiuchus cloud that has been observed ( overall size @xmath11 several pc ) ; ` clumps ' , meaning individual condensations , such as oph a , oph b etc . with typical sizes @xmath11 0.050.2 pc ; sub - structures of the clumps which we call ` clumplets ' , which refer to the smallest scale structures recovered in section [ clump_analysis ] from the 3-dimensional ( ra , dec , velocity ) data cube , and which have typical sizes of up to @xmath110.05 pc ; and ` prestellar cores ' , which are gravitationally bound starless cores within the cloud , which are detected by the presence of thermal continuum emission ( at 1300 or 850  @xmath22 ) .",
    "the last of these is introduced because the stability / longevity of the clumplet structures is currently uncertain ( see section [ clump_analysis ] ) , and they need to be distinguished compared to the more commonly used terminology of ` clumps ' that feature in many other studies . the large scale integrated co emission across the region covering oph a and oph b , c , e , f , and j clumps is shown in fig [ fig : bigco ] , along with the scuba 850  @xmath22  image from johnstone ( 2000 ) .",
    "the co map is dominated by bright emission from the oph a region , which is itself fragmented into an hierarchy of smaller clumps .",
    "the co map also shows the prominent curved molecular outflow that extends for @xmath11 30  ( @xmath111 pc ) away from the well studied source vla  1623 .",
    "away from oph a many other molecular clumps are visible , which show some correlation to the 850  @xmath22  submm continuum maps shown on the same scale .",
    "although the  @xmath0co and c@xmath1o integrated emission maps cover a smaller area than that of the co image , they show that the isotopologues are strongly concentrated around the oph a region , but again that many small clumps are well correlated with enhancements on the co map , including all of those identified on the 850  @xmath22  map .",
    "comparison with the integrated co distribution needs to be treated with caution as many of the co ( and @xmath0co ) lines are strongly self - absorbed by foreground emission .",
    "the large scale co channel maps are shown in fig [ fig : compositeco ] .",
    "co emission is present over a wide velocity range in excess of 12 . from the c@xmath1o observations ( see fig . [",
    "fig : c18o_velocity_channels ] ) , the systemic velocity , v@xmath45 of the cloud , lies mostly between @xmath11  2 and 4 , with typical c@xmath1o half power linewidths @xmath11  1.5  .",
    "the co emission by contrast extends over the velocity range -3  @xmath46  + 8 , with much of the gas at the higher offsets from the systemic velocity ( taken from the c@xmath1o spectra ) being associated with molecular outflows . at the most blueshifted offset velocities ,",
    "the maps are dominated by emission from the oph  b2 region , and from the vla  1623 outflow jet , the latter being seen most clearly in the + 1  map .",
    "bright emission from the oph a clump region dominates at a velocity of @xmath11  + 2 , but at velocities redshifted from @xmath11 + 4  the channel map shows little structure , particularly to the south - east of the oph a clump , which is a consequence of the very deep self - absorption by foreground material at this velocity . at v@xmath47 velocities between + 5 and + 8",
    "the distribution contains a lot of small - scale structure not seen in the co maps .",
    "the large scale @xmath0co channel maps are shown in fig [ fig : big13co ] .",
    "the @xmath0co emission is seen between 0 and + 7 . as with the co channel maps",
    ", the @xmath0co map fails to show prominent bright small scale structure to the south - east oph a region , even though this area contains a number of prominent submm sources .",
    "again , this is probably a consequence of wide - spread self - absorption .",
    "the large scale c@xmath1o channel maps are shown in fig [ fig : c18o_velocity_channels ] .",
    "it is clear that in the velocity channels where ( particularly toward the oph a region ) the co is strongly affected by self - absorption , the c@xmath1o channel maps show more small - scale structure , and appear to better trace the distribution of the denser material and gas clumps in the cloud .",
    "the general spatial structure from the jcmt map agrees well with that presented by liseau ( 2010 ) , who have mapped the c@xmath1o @xmath2 = 32 line from an @xmath11 10@xmath41 @xmath32 5@xmath41 area centred on the oph a clump using the apex telescope .",
    "overlays of the data with other tracers of star formation are given in figure [ fig:12co ] .",
    "assuming that co and @xmath0co are optically thick , excitation temperatures @xmath48 can be determined from using equation [ eqn1 ] :    @xmath49^{-1}$$ { \\label{eqn1}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 is the microwave background temperature and @xmath51 is as defined in equation [ eqn2 ] :    @xmath52    in the ophiuchus cloud the co lines of the main cloud components often appear self - absorbed and can not always reliably be used to estimate the excitation temperature , as foreground absorption by cooler gas reduces the main beam antenna temperatures . in cases where the @xmath0co line is optically thick ,",
    "it has been be used in place of the co line ( christie 2012 ) .",
    "the ophiuchus region presents an exceptional case , such that even in the rare @xmath0c@xmath1o isotope , the lines towards some of the denser clumps also appear opaque ( liseau 2010 ) .",
    "examples of typical spectra representative of the data quality from the oph region are shown in fig [ cospectra ] .",
    "these spectra show how the spectral appearance changes amongst the various isotopologues , which is due to the widespread self - absorption that is seen throughout the cloud .",
    "the excitation temperatures for co and @xmath0co estimated from the data are shown in figure  [ fig : excitation_12co ] .",
    "there are strong absorption features in the co emission ranging from @xmath11  2.05.5  km  s@xmath12 and it is possible the excitation temperature has been underestimated for this transition . from past studies , excitation temperatures are often observed to rise in protostellar outflows ( phillips 1982 , 1988 , rainey 1987 , hatchell 1999a , nisini 2000 , giannini 2001 ) . throughout the cloud , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are typically between @xmath111240  k.    a noticeable feature in the maps is the warm gas tracing the pdr close to oph j that is illuminated by the early - type b - type stars s1 and sr3 and ( mostly from ) the close binary hd  147889 ( b2iv , b3iv ; cassassus 2008 ) , as shown in figure [ fig : compositeco ] .",
    "the excitation temperatures near to the pdr reach @xmath11  80  k for co and @xmath11  50  k for @xmath0co .",
    "these excitation temperatures are significantly higher than temperatures found inferred for may of the regions with molecular outflows .",
    "for example near the vla  1623 outflow in oph  a , co excitation temperatures reach 3040  k in the blueshifted flow and higher in the redshifted flow ( 4050  k ) , close to the pdr .",
    "the elias  32 and wl  6 outflows in oph  b ( see section [ ophb ] ) have co excitation temperatures ranging from 2030  k , which are similar to the temperatures found in the flows from oph  c , e , and f ( including elias  29 , wl  10 , irs  44 , and irs  43 - see sections [ ophce ] and [ ophf ] ) .    the excitation temperatures for @xmath0co appear noticeably lower than that of co even though the co emission is affected by self absorption .",
    "this suggests that @xmath0co may optically thin in some regions , and that temperature estimates based on this line should therefore be corrected to take account of this .          in this section ,",
    "the data are used to infer the optical depth of @xmath0co or c@xmath1o in the cloud , and from this the mass of the cloud components . for this",
    "it is assumed that the optically thinner c@xmath1o can be used to trace the column density and mass in the cloud .",
    "however in a region like this suffering high extinction , it is important to confirm whether the emission is in fact optically thin .",
    "following equation [ eqn : co_opacity ] the optical depth is related to the intensity ratio of different co isotopologues , @xmath55 , by the relation ,    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the brightness temperature and @xmath58 is the optical depth ( of the corresponding subscripted isotopologues ) .",
    "using the method in ladd , fuller @xmath14 deane ( 1998 ) , the ratio of @xmath0co and c@xmath1o integrated intensities can be used together to provide an estimate of the optical depth of the cloud :    @xmath59 ) \\",

    "the abundance ratio was assumed to be the accepted value of @xmath65 ( frerking 1982 ) . only spectra with a peak line detection of @xmath66  3@xmath67 were used for the @xmath0co and c@xmath1o maps used to create the ratio map .",
    "figure [ fig : co_opacity ] shows the map of @xmath68 , where @xmath69 would be greater by the abundance factor of 8 .        in oph  a",
    ", the typical integrated intensity ratios @xmath0co",
    "/ c@xmath1o are observed to range from @xmath1127 , corresponding to @xmath70 of 2 @xmath46 16 and @xmath71 of @xmath110.3 @xmath46 2.0 .",
    "@xmath0co is usually found to be optically thick around the main clumps , often also showing self - absorbed profiles .",
    "c@xmath1o is also optically thick in some of the clumps , and toward the pdr . in particular @xmath0co emission from the pdr region",
    "is self - absorbed with a @xmath0co / c@xmath1o integrated intensity ratio as low as 1.2 ( where @xmath72 ) .",
    "although the optical depth of c@xmath1o throughout most of ophiuchus is found to be optically thin ( @xmath73 ) , it is optically thick in some regions , indicating that an optical depth correction does need to be applied when calculating the mass from the integrated c@xmath1o emission .",
    "including all pixels with a peak @xmath74 of at least 3@xmath67 ( 1.36",
    "k ) , the excitation temperature , @xmath48 , was calculated using the @xmath0co peak temperature ( section  [ exc_temp ] ) . in regions",
    "where @xmath48 was degenerate , or could not be uniquely estimated , the nominal excitation temperature of @xmath0co was assumed to be 20  k. the value of the abundance ratio of c@xmath1o to h@xmath19 , @xmath75 was assumed to be 10@xmath76 ( curtis 2010 , graves 2010 ) , which is similar to the commonly used value from frerking ( 1982 ) of @xmath77 .",
    "it should be cautioned that uncertainty remains concerning the question of whether co abundances remain constant in molecular clouds , with recent work showing that @xmath75 may vary according to the local ism environment , and that even within individual clouds can vary by factors of 34 ( lee 2014 ) .",
    "the mass of the cloud mapped in the present observations is estimated to be 515  @xmath4 ( or without the optical depth correction 439  @xmath4 ) .",
    "previous studies of star forming regions ( graves 2010 , curtis 2010 , buckle 2010 ) have assumed a constant excitation temperature of around 1012  k based on @xmath0co average excitation temperatures . had the lower , constant excitation temperature been adopted , the mass would have been greater by a factor of @xmath111.62.3 .",

    "the two dotted curves show the expected values for the cases where the thermal linewidth , @xmath150 is set equal to zero , and for an example curve for an kinetic temperature of 15 k , chosen to be representative of cloud material . at larger values of radii and dispersion , these two curves approach each other , joining to the solomon clouds , and showing ( despite some scatter that most plausibly may be a consequence of temperature variations in the clumps ) that the oph clumplets follow extrapolation of the larson relationship to clump radii below 0.01 pc , when thermal linewidths start to become significant compared to the velocity dispersion .",
    "although the uncertainties are relatively large , many of the oph co clumplets have dispersions close to the expected thermal linewidths for temperatures @xmath11 15 k. @xmath151 is therefore always less than 0.1 , which is negligible compared to the @xmath152 velocity dispersion of c@xmath1o in ophiuchus , which is @xmath110.8  .",

    "the luminosity for the x - axis and the sizes and linewidths that contribute to the virial mass are all deduced by moments of the intensity distribution .",
    "these moments have been extrapolated down to their expected values in the absence of noise ( as described by rosolowsky @xmath14 leroy 2006 ) . to assess the significance of an error bar , the intensity distribution ( i.e. a set of ( x , y , v , t@xmath165 ) data ) was sampled with replication to draw the same number of points from the data as in the original clump , thus enabling extrapolation of the points down to the zero level .",
    "this is a bootstrap approach , which has been theoretically justified as an empirical estimate of uncertainties given a set of measurements ( efron 1979 ) .",
    "this procedure was repeated 1000 times for each clump and the error distribution measures the width of the resulting distribution of samples .",
    "this method has been shown in practice to do a good job in assessing the uncertainties from noise in the data and from the extrapolation process .",
    "it is however less good at assessing the systematic errors engendered by the cataloguing method itself , which is a more difficult problem to solve rigorously . on figure",
    "[ fig : analysis2 ] , those points falling above the dotted line are most likely gravitationally unbound or pressure confined , whereas those falling below the dotted line may be self - gravitating . despite the rather large uncertainties , it does appear that at least some of the identified clumplets may be able to collapse to form stars .",
