    "let us consider the following hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 has units of mass and @xmath2 of frequency .",
    "in order to simplify , we are going to use natural units , such that @xmath3 , to obtain @xmath4 moreover , by choosing appropriately the value of @xmath2 , three essentially different cases can be obtained : @xmath5 these are three rare examples of exactly - solvable potentials in quantum mechanics . the first one , the harmonic oscillator , is a very well known system from which the technique of creation and annihilation operators and the whole formalism of the factorization method come from .",
    "the second , the free particle , has also been largely studied .",
    "this simple system allows us to work close to the limits of quantum theory , for example , with non - square - integrable wavefunctions with plenty of physical applications such as the plane waves .",
    "the third case is not so familiar : it is called either _ inverted oscillator _ , _ repulsive oscillator _ , _ inverse oscillator _ , or _",
    "parabolic potential barrier_. although it started as an exercise from landau s book @xcite , its physical applications have grown since the appearance of barton s phd thesis ( published in @xcite ) , v.g .",
    ", as an instability model , as a mapping of the 2d string theory @xcite , or as a toy model to study early time evolution in inflationary models @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to observe that both oscillator potentials , harmonic and inverted , are simultaneously produced inside an ideal penning trap , typically used to confine charged particles @xcite . in its standard setup",
    ", a quadrupolar electrostatic field creates a harmonic oscillator potential along the symmetry axis of the trap , inducing confinement along this direction .",
    "in addition , in the orthogonal plane a two - dimensional inverted oscillator arises , driving the particles towards the trap walls . in order to compensate for the last effect",
    ", a static homogeneous magnetic field along the symmetry axis of the trap is also applied , but for zero magnetic field the two kinds of oscillator potentials are created inside the cavity .",
    "mathematically , the harmonic and inverted oscillators are very much alike , and we will show that the solutions of one can be obtained almost directly from the other one ; nevertheless , we should remark that physically these two systems are very different .",
    "for example the harmonic oscillator has a discrete non - degenerate equidistant energy spectrum with square - integrable eigenfunctions , while the inverted oscillator has a continuous spectrum varying from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , which is double degenerate , and whose eigenfunctions are not square - integrable .    on the other hand , a standard technique for generating new exactly - solvable potentials departing from a given initial one is the supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susy qm ) ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "its simplest version , which makes use of differential intertwining operators of first - order , has been employed for generating hamiltonians whose spectra differ from the initial one in the ground state energy level .",
    "in addition , the higher - order variants , which involve differential intertwining operators of orders larger than one @xcite , allow as well the modification of one or several excited state levels .    the susy techniques of first- and higher - order have been successfully applied to the harmonic oscillator @xcite and the free particle @xcite for generating plenty of exactly - solvable potentials . however , as far as we know , neither the first- nor the higher - order susy qm have been employed taking as a point of departure the inverted oscillator . in this paper",
    "we aim to fill the gap by applying the supersymmetric transformations to the inverted oscillator . in order to do that , in section 2 we will get the general solution of the stationary schrdinger equation ( sse ) for the hamiltonian with an arbitrary energy @xmath8 , which will remain valid even for @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , the solutions which have a physical interpretation for the inverted oscillator will be identified . in section 3",
    "we are going to explore the factorization method for both systems , obtaining the bound states for the harmonic oscillator and also several sets of mathematical polynomial solutions , a class of solutions which have been of interest along the time ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in section 4",
    "we will work out the first - order susy qm for the inverted oscillator , while in section 5 we will apply the second - order one in three different situations : real , confluent and complex cases .",
    "the last one will be the most important case of the paper , as it is the only one that works out to obtain new real non - singular potentials .",
    "in section 6 we will explore the algebraic structure for the non - singular potentials generated through susy qm and their associated eigenfunctions .",
    "finally , in section 7 we will present our conclusions .",
    "the appendix contains the derivation of the orthogonality and completeness relationships for the set of eigenfunctions of the inverted oscillator hamiltonian ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "first of all , let us solve the stationary schrdinger equation for the hamiltonian with an arbitrary real energy @xmath8 , although it is still valid for @xmath9 : @xmath10 the substitution @xmath11 with @xmath12 leads to @xmath13 which is the sse for the harmonic oscillator potential in the variable @xmath14 associated with the ` energy ' @xmath15 @xcite . here",
    "we assume that @xmath16 ; otherwise we immediately get the free particle problem .",
    "thus , the general solution to the sse reads @xmath17,\\label{roy1}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the confluent hypergeometric function and @xmath19 are constants .",
    "note that , in general @xmath20 , i.e. , it does not belong to the space of square - integrable wavefunctions in one dimension for an arbitrary @xmath21 .",
    "the analysis of the solution for the harmonic oscillator ( take @xmath22 in eq .  ) is widely known and can be found for example in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "since the inverted oscillator is not commonly studied , we will work it out next in detail .",
    "the general solution of the inverted oscillator is obtained from eq .   for @xmath23 . for simplicity , it will be expressed in terms of solutions with a definite parity , the even ( @xmath24 ) and odd ( @xmath25 ) solutions , which are given by @xmath26 this decomposition will simplify our mathematical work in sections 4 and 5 .",
