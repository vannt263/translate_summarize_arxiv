    "the xas spectrum at the @xmath0 edge reflects basically the unoccupied @xmath36- and @xmath37-related peaks in the @xmath38 symmetry .",
    "this is due to the larger band - like character and the stronger crystal - field interaction of the @xmath35 states as well as due to the weaker intra - atomic interactions as compared with @xmath39 transition - metal oxides , where intra - atomic multiplet interactions are dominant .",

    "the results are in agreement with mssbauer spectroscopy.@xcite the shift to higher energies from ca@xmath15ferho@xmath10 to ca@xmath3corho@xmath4 reflects the increase in the rh valence from rh@xmath5 to rh@xmath2 as we can learn from previous studies on @xmath35 transition - metal compounds.@xcite furthermore , for ca@xmath3corho@xmath4 the spectrum shows a weak low - energy shoulder , which is weaker at the rh-@xmath40 edge than at the rh-@xmath31 edge .",
    "this shoulder can be attributed to transitions from the @xmath42 core levels to the @xmath36 state , reflecting a @xmath34 configuration with one hole at the @xmath36 state .",
    "such spectral features were found earlier for ru@xmath5 in ru(nh@xmath44)@xmath15cl@xmath10.@xcite detailed calculations reveal that the multiplet and spin - orbit interactions suppress the @xmath36-related peak at the @xmath40 edge for a @xmath34 configuration.@xcite thus , we find a rh@xmath2 ( @xmath34 ) state for ca@xmath3corho@xmath4 .",

    "it is well known that an increase of the valence state of the @xmath39 transition - metal ion by one causes a shift of the xas @xmath0 spectra by about one ev towards higher energies.@xcite the main peak of the fe @xmath31 structure of the ca@xmath15ferho@xmath10 lies 0.8 ev above the main peak of the divalent reference feo and only slightly lower in energy than the one of fe@xmath16o@xmath15 ( fe@xmath5 ) .",
    "this indicates trivalent iron ions in ca@xmath3ferho@xmath4 .",
    "the slightly lower energy shift of ca@xmath15ferho@xmath10 relative to fe@xmath16o@xmath15 can be attributed to the weak trigonal crystal field in the former as compared an octahedral field in the later , as we will show below .",
    "the experimental spectra of the reference compounds , curve ( a ) for fe@xmath23o@xmath3 and curve ( j ) for feo , can be well understood using the multiplet calculations .",
    "for fe@xmath23o@xmath3 we find a good simulation taking a fe@xmath5 ion in an octahedral symmetry with a @xmath36@xmath37 splitting of 1.6 ev , which is depicted in curve ( b ) in fig .",
    "2 . for feo ,",
    "a good match with the experiment can be found for the fe@xmath1 in an octahedral environment with a splitting of 0.9 ev , see curve ( i ) .",
    "the weaker crystal field in feo , compared with fe@xmath23o@xmath3 , is consistent due to its larger fe  o bond length .    in order to understand the experimental fe @xmath0 spectrum of ca@xmath3ferho@xmath4 , we first return to the fe@xmath23o@xmath3 spectrum .",
    "when we reduce the @xmath36@xmath37 splitting from 1.6 ev ( curve b ) via 1.0 ev ( curve c ) to 0.0 ev ( curve d ) , we observe that the the low - energy shoulder becomes washed out , while the high - energy shoulder becomes more pronounced.@xcite going further to a trigonal crystal field , the high - energy shoulder looses its intensity as shown in curve ( e ) for a splitting of 0.9 ev between @xmath45 ( @xmath46/@xmath47 ) and @xmath29/@xmath48 ( @xmath49/@xmath50/@xmath51 ) . the experimental fe-@xmath0 xas spectrum of ca@xmath3ferho@xmath4 in fig . [ fig : fel23](g ) can be well reproduced with this trigonal crystal field of 0.9 ev and in addition a mixing parameter @xmath52 ev , which mixes the @xmath48 with the @xmath53 orbitals ; the result for this fe with the @xmath54 high - spin configuration is presented in curve ( f ) .",
    "we note that curve ( f ) has been generated with the fe in the trivalent state . as a check",
    ", we have also tried to fit the experimental spectrum of ca@xmath3ferho@xmath4 using a divalent fe ansatz . however , the simulation does not match , as is illustrated in curve ( h ) , in which we have used the same trigonal crystal field splitting of 0.9 ev and mixing parameter of 0.4 ev .",
    "to conclude , the fe-@xmath0 and rh-@xmath0 xas spectra of ca@xmath15ferho@xmath10 firmly establish the fe@xmath5/rh@xmath5 scenario .    for the ca@xmath3corho@xmath4 system ,",
    "the rh-@xmath0 xas spectra suggest that the rh ions are tetravalent , implying that the co ions should be divalent . to confirm this co@xmath1/rh@xmath2 scenario we have to study explicitly the valence of the co ion .",

    "the ca@xmath15corho@xmath10 spectrum lies at the same energy position as the coo spectrum confirming the co@xmath1/rh@xmath2 scenario@xcite and ruling out the co@xmath5/rh@xmath5 scenario.@xcite the result is fully consistent with the above finding from the rh-@xmath0 edge of ca@xmath15corho@xmath10 and in agreement with previous results from x - ray photoemission spectroscopy.@xcite",
    "after determining the valence states of rh , fe , and co ions we turn our attention to the orbital occupation and magnetic properties of the co@xmath1 ion at the trigonal - prism site .",
    "this is motivated by the consideration that co@xmath1 ions may have a large orbital moment,@xcite whose size depends on details of the crystal field , while the high - spin fe@xmath5 ( @xmath54 ) and low - spin rh@xmath5 ( @xmath33 ) ions in ca@xmath3ferho@xmath4 have a closed subshell without orbital degrees of freedom and thus no orbital moment .    in trigonal - prism symmetry",
    "the @xmath39 orbitals are split into @xmath55 , @xmath29 , and @xmath56 states , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dlevels ] . in terms of one - electron levels , the @xmath55 orbitals lie highest in energy , while the lower lying @xmath29 , and @xmath56 usually are nearly degenerate . for a co@xmath5 @xmath57 system ,",
    "it is _ a priori _ not obvious from band structure calculations to say which of these low lying orbitals gets occupied .",
    "details , such as the inclusion of the spin - orbit interaction , can become crucial .",
    "indeed , for ca@xmath3co@xmath23o@xmath4 , it was found from lda+u calculations @xcite and confirmed by xmcd measurements @xcite that the spin - orbit interaction is crucial to stabilize the occupation of the @xmath21 orbital , thereby giving rise to giant orbital moments and ising - type magnetism .",
    "for a co@xmath1 @xmath58 ion , however , the situation is quite different .",
    "as we will explain below , the double occupation of the @xmath7 orbitals is energetically much more favored than that of the @xmath59 : the energy difference could be of order 1 ev while the @xmath29 and @xmath56 by themselves could be degenerate on a one - electron level .",
    "the consequences are straightforward : the double occupation of @xmath7 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dlevels](a ) , should lead to a large orbital moment of @xmath60 ( neglecting covalent effects ) and ising type of magnetism with the magnetization direction fixed along the chains.@xcite in contrast , the @xmath59 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dlevels](b ) , would have given a quenched orbital moment .    in order to experimentally establish that the co@xmath1 ion has the @xmath7 configuration , we have performed an xmcd study at the co-@xmath0 edges of ca@xmath15corho@xmath10 .",
    "[ fig : xmcdco ] shows the co-@xmath0 xmcd spectrum of ca@xmath15corho@xmath10 taken at 50 k under 5.5 t. the spectra were taken , respectively , with the photon spin parallel ( @xmath61 , red dotted curve ) and antiparallel ( @xmath62 , black solid curve ) to the magnetic field .",
    "one can clearly observe large differences between the two spectra with the different alignments .",
    "their difference , @xmath63 , is the xmcd spectrum ( blue dashed curve ) .",
    "an important feature of xmcd experiments is that there are sum rules , developed by thole and carra _",
    "et al._,@xcite to determine the ratio between the orbital ( @xmath64 ) and spin ( @xmath65 ) contributions to the magnetic moment , namely    @xmath66    here , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the energy integrals of the @xmath69 and @xmath70 xmcd intensity .",
    "the advantage of these sum rules is that one needs not to do any simulations of the spectra to obtain the desired quantum numbers . in our particular case",
    ", we can immediately recognize the presence of a large orbital moment in fig .",
    "[ fig : xmcdco](a ) , since there is a large net ( negative ) integrated xmcd spectral weight .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ eq : morbmspin ] ) we find @xmath71 . since the co@xmath1 ion is quite ionic , @xmath72 is very close to the expected ionic value of @xmath73 .",

    "[ fig : col23](d ) and [ fig : xmcdco](b ) , respectively .",
    "we can clearly observe that the simulations reproduce the experimental spectra very well .",
    "the parameters @xcite used are those which indeed give the @xmath7 orbital occupation for the ground state .",
    "the magnetic quantum numbers found are @xmath80 and @xmath81 , yielding @xmath82 and a total co magnetic moment of @xmath83 . with the rh in the @xmath84 tetravalent state",
    ", the total magnetic moment per formula unit should be around @xmath85 .",
    "this is not inconsistent with the results of the high - field magnetization study by niitaka _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite : they found a total moment of @xmath86 , but there the saturation of the magnetization has not yet been reached even under 18.7 tesla .",
    "this can now be understood since the magnetocrystalline anisotropy , associated with the active spin - orbit coupling , is extremely strong and makes it difficult to fully magnetize a powder sample as was used in their study .",
    "we also have simulated the spectra for the @xmath59 scenario .",
    "these are depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig : col23](e ) for the xas and [ fig : xmcdco](c ) for the xmcd .",
    "it is obvious that the experimental spectra are not reproduced .",
    "the simulated line shapes are very different from the experimental ones and the integral of the simulated xmcd spectrum yields a vanishing orbital moment .",
    "we therefore can safely conclude that the ground state of this material is not @xmath59 .",
    "for completeness we mention that the magnetic quantum numbers found for this @xmath59 ansatz are @xmath87 and @xmath88 , yielding @xmath89 and a total co magnetic moment of @xmath90 .",
    "having established that the ground state of ca@xmath15corho@xmath10 has the co@xmath1 @xmath58 ion in the doubly occupied @xmath7 orbital configuration and not in the @xmath59 , it is interesting to study its stability in more detail . as already mentioned above , for a co@xmath5 @xmath57 ion",

    "( for the @xmath59 simulations above we have used @xmath97 ev . )",
    "this is a very large number indeed , and it can be traced back to the multiplet character of the on - site coulomb interactions : an occupation of @xmath59 means a much stronger overlap of the electron clouds as compared to the case for a @xmath7 .",
    "this results in a higher repulsion energy , which is not a small quantity in view of the atomic - like values of the @xmath98 and @xmath99 slater integrals determining the multiplet splitting.@xcite    in the middle panel of fig .",
