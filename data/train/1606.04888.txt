    "the inflationary universe has become one of the central paradigms in modern cosmology .",
    "this is due to the fact that many long - standing problems of the big bang model , such as the horizon , flatness , homogeneity and monopole problems , find a natural explanation in the framework of the inflationary universe @xcite .",
    "however , the essential feature of inflation is that it generates a mechanism to explain the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe @xcite and provides a causal interpretation of the origin of the anisotropies observed in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation@xcite , since primordial density perturbations may be produced from quantum fluctuations during the inflationary era .    despite its success ,",
    "a theory of inflation is still missing , all we have is a large collection of inflationary models ( see e.g.@xcite , and for a classification of inflationary models see@xcite ) .",
    "the inflaton potential can not be derived from a fundamental theory in a unique way . moreover",
    ", the potential must be specially designed to be flat , and this is the fine - tuning problem of inflation .",
    "natural inflation ( ni ) with a pseudo - nambu goldstone boson ( pngb ) as the inflaton@xcite is provided in certain particle physics model@xcite .",
    "the scalar potential , which is flat due to shift symmetries , has the form @xmath5.\\label{vnat}\\ ] ] and it is characterized by two mass scales @xmath1 and @xmath2 with @xmath6 . it is assumed that a global symmetry is spontaneously broken at some scale @xmath1 , with a soft explicit symmetry breaking at a lower scale @xmath2 .",
    "natural inflation has been already studied in standard cosmology based on einstein s general relativity@xcite . upon comparison to the current cosmological and astronomical observations , specially those related with the cmb temperature anisotropies , it is possible to constrain several inflation models .",
    "particularly , the constraints in the @xmath3 plane give us the predictions of a number of representative inflationary potentials .",
    "recently , the planck collaboration has published new data of enhanced precision of the cmb anisotropies @xcite . here",
    ", the planck full mission data has improved the upper bound on the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath7(@xmath8 cl ) which is similar to obtained from @xcite , in which @xmath9 ( @xmath8 cl ) . in particular ,",
    "natural inflation is consistent with current data @xcite for trans - planckian values of the symmetry breaking scale @xmath1 , for which it may be expect the low - energy effective theory , on which ( [ vnat ] ) is based , to break down @xcite .",
    "regarding the last data of planck , this model is consistent for @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the reduced planck mass @xmath12 gev .",
    "nevertheless , several mechanisms which yield the potential ( [ vnat ] ) with super - planckian values for the symmetry breaking scale @xmath1 consistent with a low energy description , have been proposed recently @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it would be challenging to study natural inflation in non - standard cosmologies .",
    "considering non - standard cosmologies is motivated by at least two facts , namely i ) deviations from the standard friedmann equation arise in higher - dimensional theories of gravity , and ii ) there is no observational test of the friedmann equation before the primordial big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) epoch .",
    "a well - studied example of a novel higher - dimensional theory is brane - world models .",
    "brane models are inspired from m / superstring theory and although they are not yet derivable from the fundamental theory , at least they contain the basic ingredients , such as extra dimensions , higher - dimensional objects ( branes ) , higher - curvature corrections to gravity ( gauss - bonnet ) etc . since superstring theory claims to give us a fundamental description of nature it is important to study what kind of cosmology it predicts .",
    "regarding the realization of natural inflation in non - standard cosmologies , some works have been put forward in the literature so far @xcite , achieving sub - planckian values for the symmetry breaking scale @xmath1 , being consistent with the data available at that time .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to study the realization of ni in the high - energy regime of the rs - ii brane model , in the light of the recent planck results .",
    "later on we will show that our results are modified significantly compared to@xcite using the planck results . by comparing the theoretical predictions of the model together with the allowed contour plots , and we conclude that the model is viable .",
    "using the latest planck results only the inflaton potential mass scales @xmath13 are given in terms of the five - dimensional planck mass , which remains unconstraint though .",
    "however , we insist on considering a higher - dimensional planck mass of the order of , say , @xmath4 , since there are several good theoretical reasons for that .",
    "we organize our work as follows : after this introduction , in the next section we summarize the basics of the brane model as well as the dynamics of inflation . in the third section",
    "we analyze natural inflation in the framework of rs - ii model and present our results , and in the last section we finish with our conclusions .",
    "we choose units so that @xmath14 .",
    "in the brane - world scenario the main idea is that our four - dimensional world and the standard model of particle physics are confined to live on a 3-dimensional brane , while gravity lives in the higher - dimensional bulk .",
    "since the higher - dimensional plank mass @xmath15 is the fundamental mass scale instead of the usual four - dimensional planck mass @xmath16 , the brane concept has been used to address the hierarchy problem of particle physics , initially in the simple framework of a flat ( 4+n ) spacetime with 4 large dimensions and n small compact dimensions@xcite , and later refined by randall and sundrum@xcite . for",
    "an introduction to brane cosmology see e.g.@xcite . in the rs - ii model @xcite ,",
    "the four - dimensional einstein equations may be written as @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the four - dimensional cosmological constant , @xmath19 is the energy - momentum tensor of matter on the brane , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the projection of the five - dimensional weyl tensor @xmath22 on the brane , where @xmath23 is the unit vector normal to the brane . @xmath24 and @xmath25 encode the information about the bulk .",
    "the four - dimensional quantities can be computed in terms of the five - dimensional ones as follows@xcite @xmath26 @xmath27 the friedmann equation for a flat frw background is given by @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an integration constant coming from @xmath24 .",
    "the term @xmath30 is known as the dark radiation , since it decays in the same way as radiation .",
    "however , during inflation this term will be rapidly diluted , and we can neglect it .",
    "the five - dimensional planck mass is constraint by the standard bib - bang nucleosynthesis to be @xmath31@xcite . in the following",
    ", we will take the four - dimensional cosmological constant @xmath18 to be zero , or in other words we adopt the rs fine tuning @xmath32 so that model can explain the cosmic acceleration without cosmological constant , and neglecting the term @xmath30 the friedmann equation ( [ flatfe ] ) becomes @xmath33 which becomes the basis of our study on brane - world inflation .      at low energies ,",
    "i.e. , when @xmath34 , inflation in the brane - world scenario behaves in exactly the same way as standard inflation .",
    "but at higher energies we would expect the dynamics of inflation to be changed .",
    "we consider slow - roll inflation driven by a scalar field @xmath35 , for which the energy density @xmath36 and the pressure @xmath37 are given by @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , where @xmath40 is the scalar potential .",
    "we assume that the scalar field is confined to the brane , so the four - dimensional klein - gordon equation still holds @xmath41 where prime indicates derivative with respect to @xmath35 , and dot a derivative with respect to cosmic time .",
    "we can use the slow - roll approximation to write ( [ finalflatfe ] ) and ( [ kg ] ) as @xmath42 and @xmath43 in this way , using these two equations , it is possible to write the slow - roll parameters on the brane as@xcite @xmath44 slow - roll inflation implies that @xmath45 and @xmath46 , as in standard cosmology .",
    "these reduce to standard slow - roll parameters at the the low - energy limit @xmath47 .",
    "on the other hand , in the high - energy limit , i.e. , @xmath48 , these expressions become @xmath49 the deviations from standard slow - roll inflation can be seen in the high - energy as both the parameters are suppressed by a factor @xmath50 .",
    "the number of @xmath51-folds in the slow - roll approximation , using ( [ finalflatfe ] ) and ( [ kg ] ) , yields @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the values of the scalar field when the cosmological scales cross the hubble - radius and at the end of inflation , respectively .",
    "as it can be seen , the number of @xmath51-folds is increased due to an extra term of @xmath50 .",
    "this implies a more amount of inflation , between these two values of the field , compared to standard inflation .      in the following",
    ", we will give a review of cosmological perturbations in brane - world inflation .",
    "we consider the gauge invariant quantity @xmath55 . here",
    ", @xmath56 is defined on slices of uniform density and reduces to the curvature perturbation at super - horizon scales .",
    "a fundamental feature of @xmath56 is that it is nearly constant on super - horizon scales@xcite , and in fact this property does not depend on the gravitational field equations@xcite . therefore , for the spatially flat gauge , we have @xmath57 , where @xmath58 . in this way , using the slow - roll approximation , the spectra of scalar perturbations is given by@xcite @xmath59 on the other hand , the tensor perturbations are more involved since the gravitons can propagate in the bulk .",
    "the amplitude of tensor perturbations is given by@xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 ^ 2\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\left[\\sqrt{1+x^2}-x^2 \\sinh^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\right]^{-1/2},\\label{ft}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath62 is given by @xmath63    the expressions for the spectra are , as always , to be evaluated at hubble radius crossing @xmath64 .",
    "as expected , in the the low - energy limit the expressions for the scalar and tensor spectra become the same as those derived without considering the brane effects .",
    "however , in the high - energy limit , these expressions become @xmath65    the scale dependence of the scalar power spectra is determined by the scalar spectral index , which under the slow - roll approximation , obeys the usual relation @xmath66    the amplitude of tensor perturbations can be parameterized by the tensor - to - scalar ratio , defined to be@xcite @xmath67 which implies that in the low - energy limit this expression becomes @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the standard slow - roll parameter , whereas in the high - energy limit we have that @xmath70 , with @xmath69 corresponding to eq.([ephe ] ) .",
    "as we have seen , at late times the brane - world cosmology is identical to the standard one . during the early universe , particularly during inflation",
    ", there may be changes to the perturbations predicted by the standard cosmology , if the energy density is sufficiently high compared with the brane tension . in the following ,",
    "we will obtain the predictions for the natural inflationary model in the brane - world scenario in the high - energy limit , and to try to ascertain whether these predictions are compatible with current observational constraints .",
    "natural inflation in the randall - sundrum brane - world scenario is characterized by 3 parameters in total , namely the 5-dimensional planck mass and the mass scales of the inflaton potential ( [ vnat ] ) , @xmath2 and @xmath1 , respectively . in the high - energy limit ,",
