    "the theory of the dynamics of rational semigroups on @xmath5 has developed in many directions since the 1990s ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the julia set @xmath7 of a rational semigroup generated by finitely many elements @xmath8 has * backward self - similarity * i.e. @xmath9 ( see @xcite ) , it can be viewed as a significant generalization and extension of both the theory of iteration of rational maps ( see @xcite ) and conformal iterated function systems ( see @xcite ) . indeed ,",
    "because of ( [ bsseq ] ) , the analysis of the julia sets of rational semigroups somewhat resembles `` backward iterated functions systems '' , however since each map @xmath10 is not in general injective ( critical points ) , some qualitatively different extra effort in the cases of semigroups is needed .",
    "the theory of the dynamics of rational semigroups borrows and develops tools from both of these theories .",

    "the deep relation between these fields ( rational semigroups , random complex dynamics , and ( backward ) ifs ) is explained in detail in the subsequent papers ( @xcite ) of the first author .    in this paper , we deal at length with bowen s parameter @xmath11 ( the unique zero of the pressure function ) of expanding finitely generated rational semigroups @xmath12 ( see definition  [ d : bpara ] ) . in the usual iteration dynamics of a single expanding rational map , it is well known that the hausdorff dimension of the julia set is equal to the bowen s parameter . for a general expanding",
    "finitely generated rational semigroup @xmath12 , it was shown that the bowen s parameter is larger than or equal to the hausdorff dimension of the julia set ( @xcite ) . if we assume further that the semigroup satisfies the `` open set condition '' ( see definition  [ d : osc ] ) , then it was shown that they are equal ( @xcite ) . however ,",
    "if we do not assume the open set condition , then there are a lot of examples such that the bowen s parameter is strictly larger than the hausdorff dimension of the julia set .",
