    "0 in this paper we continue the study started in @xcite of the duality between minkowski space - time and a conformal field theory defined on the boundary of the light - cone .",
    "that semiclassical gravity may know something about quantum field theories was first demonstrated by brown and henneaux in 1986 @xcite who looked at the algebra of gravitational constraints generating the asymptotic symmetries of three - dimensional anti - de sitter space - time and found that those constraints form conformal virasoro algebra with calculable central charge .",
    "this was the first indication in the physical literature that asymptotically anti - de sitter space encodes some non - trivial information about conformal symmetry and quantum anomalies in the space one dimension lower . at approximately same time",
    "mathematicians fefferman and graham @xcite were interested in the purely mathematical problem of finding possible conformal invariants and discovered that all such invariants are naturally induced from the ordinary metric invariants near conformal boundary of the hyperbolic space one dimension higher .",
    "the relation between conformal symmetry and the einstein spaces with negative cosmological constant thus was established . in their analysis",
    "they invented a technical tool of asymptotic expansion , the now famous `` fefferman - graham expansion '' , which later on proved to be very useful in the physical applications .    for almost a decade",
    "the two sides ( physical and mathematical ) of the story followed in parallel without making any close contact .",
    "this was until the holographic principle @xcite , @xcite was formulated and a concrete realization of this principle , the ads / cft correspondence , was suggested @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . according to the holographic idea",
    "the space - time physics of gravitationally interacting particles should be more economically described in terms of some theory living on the boundary ( the so - called `` holographic screen '' ) . in the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence the bulk space - time is anti - de sitter space and the theory on the boundary is a quantum conformal field theory .",
    "it is possible to formulate precise bulk / boundary dictionary translating the ( super)gravity phenomena in the bulk to that of cft on the boundary and vise versa .",
    "this led to many interesting developments . among others",
    ", it was understood that there is a deep relation between geometry of the negative constant curvature space - time and quantum properties of the conformal theories .",
    "in particular , the conformal anomalies can be calculated purely geometrically @xcite by first expanding the bulk einstein metric near the conformal boundary and then inserting the expansion back to the gravitational action .",
    "the fefferman - graham expansion thus made its new appearance and helped to reproduce the brown - henneaux central charge in a purely geometrical fashion .",
    "the asymptotic diffeomorphisms in anti - de sitter space play an important role generating the conformal symmetry at the boundary @xcite and imposing severe constraints on the possible form of the anomalies @xcite , @xcite . not only conformal anomalies but also the whole structure of the anomalous stress - tensor of quantum cft might be possible to extract from the geometry of hyperbolic space @xcite , @xcite",
    ". however , with the exception of the three - dimensional case @xcite this is still an open problem .",
    "an important element in the holographic description is the way how the hologram should be decoded , i.e. how the bulk gravitational physics is restored from the boundary cft data . in @xcite",
    "the necessary holographic data were found to be the metric representing the conformal class on the boundary and the boundary cft stress tensor .",
    "the ref.@xcite then gives precise prescriptions for how the space - time metric can be reconstructed from these data .",
    "the success of the ads / cft duality has motivated the attempts to extend the holographic description to other spaces . it was rather natural to generalize it first to de sitter space , many elements of this new duality extend straightforwardly from the anti - de sitter case while many new subtleties arise @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one of them is the problem with unitarity since typical conformal weights arising in the duality with de sitter space are complex .",
    "another is the problem of formulating the s - matrix description in de sitter space .",
    "both problems are still open although some suggestions have been made @xcite , @xcite .",
    "minkowski space - time is another important space a holographic description of which should be understood .",
    "a number of ideas and proposals has been circulated in the literature @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was suggested to associate the holographic picture with a choice of light - cone in minkowski space . the part of the space - time which is out - side the light - cone is naturally foliated with de sitter slices while the part which is inside is sliced with the euclidean anti - de sitter spaces .",
    "the only boundary of these slices is the boundary of the light - cone itself which is suggested to be the place where the holographic data should be collected .",
    "formulating the holographic dictionary one can make use of the known prescriptions of the ads / cft and ds / cft dualities applying these prescriptions to each separate slice and then summing over all slices .",
    "the details of this procedure have been worked out in @xcite .",
    "in fact , this line of reasoning follows the inspirational paper @xcite where the euclidean hyperbolic space was considered in the context of the cone structure in flat space one dimension higher .",
    "the symmetry plays an important role in the identifying the way the holographic data should be presented .",
    "the lorentz group of ( d+2)-dimensional minkowski space becomes the conformal group acting on d - sphere lying at ( past or future ) infinity of the light - cone .",
    "the data thus are expected to have a cft representation . in this picture",
    "it is natural that the propagating near null infinity plane waves are dually described by an infinite set of the conformal operators living on the d - sphere .",
    "moreover the quantum - mechanical s - matrix can be restored in terms of the correlation functions of operators on two d - spheres : at infinite past and infinite future on the light - cone .    in the present study",
    "we extend the picture suggested in @xcite and apply it to the gravitational field itself .",
    "more specifically , we want to identify the minimal set of data which has to be specified at the boundary of the light - cone and which is sufficient for complete reconstruction of the bulk minkowski space - time .",
    "we understand minkowski space in a wide sense as a ricci - flat space - time asymptotically approaching the standard flat space structure .",
    "it should be noted that there have been earlier attempts in the literature to proceed in a similar direction @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the main idea was to integrate the einstein equations with zero cosmological constant starting with the boundary at spatial infinity and developing the series expansion in the radial direction in the similar fashion as fefferman and graham have taught us to do in the case of equations with negative cosmological constant .",
    "this program , however , does not work as nicely for asymptotically flat space as it did for asymptotically ads space .",
    "the recurrent relations between terms in the formal series are now differential rather than algebraic as in the ads case .",
    "it is not possible to resolve them and express the coefficients in the series in terms of some boundary data at the spatial infinity .",
    "the proposal made in @xcite is to start at infinity of the light - cone and integrate the equations from there .",
    "one has to develop double expansion in this case : first expansion goes along the constant - curvature slice and the second is in the radial direction enumerating the slices .",
    "the relations between coefficients are now algebraic .",
    "they can be resolved and the necessary boundary data identified . in order to avoid the complexity of non - linear gravitational equations we consider the linear perturbations and",
    "do the analysis for the perturbations .",
    "this certainly simplifies the problem and provides us with the important information on the non - linear case as well .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give some comments on the holographic reconstruction in general emphasizing the role of the causality .",
    "we use two - dimensional examples to illustrate our point . in section 3",
    "we review the holographic proposal of @xcite in the case of the scalar field .",
    "the way the duality works in two - dimensional rindler space is briefly discussed .",
    "we turn to the gravitational case in section 4 and proceed in two steps .",
    "first , we reduce the minkowski problem to an infinite set of gravitational equations on de sitter space one dimension lower . these equations",
    "are quite remarkable : they describe massless and massive gravitons on de sitter space .",
    "in particular the partially massless graviton appears naturally in this reduction . in the second step",
    "we solve each graviton field equation on de sitter space and identify the boundary data .",
    "decoding the hologram we then have to set the rules and translate the boundary data to the bulk gravitational physics . in section 5",
    "we make a step in this direction and consider the asymptotic form of the black hole space - time and identify the holographic data which encode the information about the mass of the static gravitational configuration .",
    "we conclude in section 6 .",
    "0 we start with some general comments on the holographic reconstruction and show that it can be formulated as a ( somewhat unusual ) boundary value problem .",
    "more specifically it is the problem in which the boundary data are entirely specified on time - like or null - like boundary . to make this discussion concrete and simple",
    "we take a particular example of massless field in ( 1 + 1)-dimensional space - time .",
    "let s first consider the flat space - time with coordinates @xmath0 , the field equation than takes the form -_t^2+_z^2=0  .",
    "suppose we consider only a part of the space which lies at positive values of coordinate @xmath1 .",
    "the standard way to formulate the cauchy problem in this case would be to specify 1 ) some initial conditions at @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ; and 2 ) the boundary conditions : @xmath5 or @xmath6 . the necessity to have two pieces of data , one on the `` initial surface '' @xmath2 and another on",
    "the boundary @xmath7 , follows from simple causality argument : in order to determine the value of the function @xmath8 at a point @xmath0 we have to have data inside the past - directed light - cone with the tip at the point @xmath0 . for small values of @xmath9 the light - cone",
    "hits only some part of the `` initial surface '' and the data on that part is sufficient for the determining the value at the point @xmath0 . but for large value of @xmath9 the light - cone starts to hit the boundary at @xmath7 and the additional data should be specified there .",
    "thus , two pieces of the data come out very naturally in this standard formulation .    in the holographic formulation we would like to have only one piece of data , namely data to be fixed on the time - like boundary @xmath7 , and",
    "determine the field @xmath8 for all values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 from just this data .",
    "simple causality picture considered above in the case of standard formulation helps to visualize the problem in this new formulation . we should again draw a light - cone with the tip at the point @xmath0 but now directed towards the boundary .",
    "the boundary data specified on the part of the boundary which lies inside of this light - cone should be sufficient for determining the field @xmath12 at the point @xmath0 .",
    "another words , in order to reconstruct the field at the point @xmath0 from the data on the boundary ( @xmath7 ) we should be able to communicate with that point by sending a signal and wait long enough to get the signal back from the point @xmath0 . that s qualitatively how this sort of reconstruction should work .",
    "of course , in order to reconstruct the field for all points @xmath0 we should have at our disposal the all - time boundary data , i.e. for @xmath10 .",
    "as for the question what kind of boundary data should be specified the case of equation ( [ h1 ] ) shows us that we have to specify a pair of functions ( t , z=0)=(t )  and  _ z ( t , z=0)=(t ) on the boundary @xmath7 .",
    "this pair forms the holographic data on the boundary .",
    "this is typical situation when the holographic data comes in a pair ( function itself and its normal derivative ) and we will call this a `` holographic pair '' . the field equation ( [ h1 ] ) subject to the boundary conditions ( [ h2 ] ) can be easily solved and the solution reads ( t , z)=12[(t+z)+(t - z)]+12_t - z^t+zdt(t )  . thus in order to reconstruct the field at a point @xmath0 we have to know boundary value @xmath13 of the field in two moments of time : @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and the normal derivative @xmath6 on the boundary for all moments of time in - between .    we of course could try to find the solution as an expansion in distance from the boundary .",
    "the solution then would take the form of sum of two infinite series ( t , z)=_n=0^^(2n)_t(t)+ _ n=0^^(2n)_t(t )  , where within each series all coefficients are determined by the boundary function @xmath16 , @xmath17 and the function @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "notice that the causal structure obvious in the complete solution ( [ h3 ] ) is now invisible in the expansion ( [ h4 ] ) .",
    "the expansion similar to ( [ h4 ] ) is the standard way to solve the holographic boundary value problem for a field in anti - de sitter space .",
    "the boundary data then are associated with some cft data on the boundary .",
    "let s for simplicity consider the two - dimensional anti - de sitter space with metric & & ds^2=d^24 ^ 2 - 1(1 - 4)^2dt^2 + & & = g()[-dt^2+dz^2 ]  , where we introduced coordinate @xmath20 the anti - de sitter space has time - like boundary located at @xmath21 or at @xmath7 in terms of the coordinate @xmath1 .",
    "the holographic boundary data thus should be specified there .",
    "the metric ( [ h5 ] ) is conformal to two - dimensional flat space - time , actually to a part of it with @xmath22 .",
    "the massless scalar field in two dimensions is conformally invariant so that the solution to the boundary value problem again takes the form ( [ h3 ] ) where @xmath1 should be replaced with @xmath23 .",
    "the small @xmath24 expansion then has two sort of terms ( t,)=[(t)+_k=1^f_k(t)^k]+^1/2[(t)+_k=1^g_k(t)^k ]  , where @xmath16 is the boundary value of the field @xmath12 and @xmath18 is the normal derivative of the field at the boundary of anti - de sitter .",
    "the coefficients @xmath25 are completely determined by @xmath16 and its derivatives while @xmath26 are determined by @xmath18 .",
    "notice again that the causal structure present in solution ( [ h3 ] ) ( with @xmath27 ) is lost when we re - write it in the form of the @xmath24-expansion . in the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence the holographic pair @xmath28 has the following interpretation : @xmath16 is associated with the source which couples to a `` dual '' operator @xmath29 while @xmath18 should be associated with the quantum expectation value of that operator , @xmath30 .",
    "the correlation function of the operators at different moments of time can be derived according to the standard ads / cft prescription by taking the normal derivatives of the green s function d=-12  , where @xmath31 is the geodesic distance between two points on two - dimensional anti - de sitter space .",
    "the 2-point function on the boundary of ads@xmath32 then reads @xcite ~1 ^ 2(t - t2 )  .",
    "the two - dimensional case is of course too simplistic for applying the ads / cft dictionary in full since the `` boundary '' in this case is just a point cross the time .",
    "however , this is a good illustration since in higher dimensions the logic in identifying the holographic data and recovering the way of reconstructing the bulk physics from that data is essentially the same .",
    "in particular the @xmath24-expansion similar to ( [ h6 ] ) is the usual tool for analyzing the reconstruction of supergravity in the bulk from the cft data on the boundary of anti - de sitter . in the case of the gravitational field itself it is actually the only tool available due to extreme non - linearity of the gravitational field equations @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we , however , want to emphasize the role of causality in the holographic reconstruction .",
    "this role is not obvious when the local series expansion is used .",
    "it is interesting that the boundary should not be necessarily time - like .",
    "the holographic boundary problem can be set for a null - like boundary . to illustrate this let s once again exploit our two - dimensional example and consider arbitrary two - dimensional metric which always can be brought to a conformally flat form ds^2=e^(x_+,x_-)dx_+dx_-  .",
    "let s consider the part of the space - time which lies in the conner @xmath33 , the boundary thus consists of two `` null surfaces '' @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) and @xmath36 ( @xmath35 ) . as the boundary data we specify the value of the field function ( x_+,x_-)|_h_-=(x_+ )  and  ( x_+,x_-)|_h_+=(x_- ) on these null - surfaces .",
    "since on the intersection of @xmath35 and @xmath37 the data should agree we have a constraint , @xmath38 .",
    "the solution of such formulated boundary value problem for the massless scalar field equation then takes a very simple form ( x_+,x_-)=(x_+)+(x_-)-_h  .",
    "thus , in order to reconstruct the field at the point @xmath39 in the bulk we have to know the boundary data at three points on the null boundary : at point @xmath40 on @xmath35 , at point @xmath41 on @xmath37 and at the bifurcation point @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "a natural example of the null - surface is horizon in black hole space - time or de sitter space . that horizon can play the role of the holographic screen and there might be a dual cft living on the horizon with bulk / boundary dictionary similar to the one in the case of ads / cft correspondence was proposed in @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to that paper for further details .",
    "another example when the null - surfaces are natural holographic screens is the minkowski space - time and the null - screens are the light - cone and null - infinity . this is a possible way of looking at the minkowski / cft duality suggested in @xcite .",
    "we discuss this briefly in the next section .",
    "0 the holographic construction suggested in @xcite is associated with a choice of light - cone .",
    "the null - surface of a given light - cone @xmath44 naturally splits minkowski spacetime @xmath45 on two regions : the region @xmath46 lying inside light - cone @xmath44 and the region @xmath47 outside light - cone .",
    "the inside region @xmath46 on the other hand splits on the part which is inside the future light - cone ( @xmath48 ) and the part which is inside the past light - cone ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "each region admits natural slicing with constant curvature hypersurfaces . outside the light - cone",
    "it is the slicing with @xmath50-dimensional de sitter spaces ( which is positive constant curvature spacetime with lorentz signature ) while inside the light - cone one may choose the foliation with euclidean anti - de sitter hypersurfaces defined as positive constant curvature space with euclidean signature . enumerating the slices we choose",
    "the radial coordinate @xmath51 in the region @xmath47 and the time - like coordinate @xmath9 in the region @xmath46 .",
    "the minkowski metric then reads : ds^2=dr^2+r^2(-d^2+^2 d^2 ( ) ) + a : ds^2=-dt^2+t^2(dy^2+^2 yd^2 ( ) )  , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the coordinates on a de sitter and anti - de sitter slice respectively , @xmath54 is metric on unit radius d - sphere with angle coordinates @xmath55 .    each slice in this foliation of minkowski spacetime",
    "is a @xmath50-dimensional space which has some boundaries . in the anti - de sitter case",
    "the boundary is the @xmath56-dimensional sphere @xmath57 lying at infinity of the space while boundaries of de sitter space are two spheres @xmath58 and @xmath59 lying respectively in the future and in the past of de sitter space .",
    "the considered foliation has a nice property that all slices have same boundaries as the light - cone , namely either @xmath58 or @xmath59 .",
    "more precisely , all anti - de sitter slices covering region @xmath49 inside the light - cone have @xmath59 as a boundary while @xmath58 is the only boundary of slices covering region @xmath48 . outside the light - cone , in the region @xmath47 , all de sitter slices have same boundary @xmath58 in the future and @xmath59 in the past .",
    "this property motivated the suggestion made in @xcite to associate the holographic information on minkowski space with these two @xmath56-dimensional spheres .",
    "the lorentz group of @xmath60-dimensional minkowski space acts as a conformal group on the spheres @xmath58 or @xmath59 .",
    "the holographic information thus is expected to have a conformal field theory description .",
    "some of the details of this holographic description have been demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "an important element of the description is the specification of necessary information to be stored on the holographic screens as well as the way how the hologram should be decoded , i.e. the rules of reconstruction the bulk minkowski physics from the holographic data on the spheres .",
    "this can be illustrated on the example of a massless scalar field described by the field equation @xmath61 .",
    "let s take for concreteness the region @xmath47 outside the light - cone .",
    "then the field equation reads & & ( _ r^2+(d+1)r_r+1r^2 ^ 2 _ ds ) ( r,,)=0 ,   + & & ^2_ds=-^2_-d_+^-2 _ , where @xmath62 is the laplace operator on unit radius d - sphere . solving equation ( [ 2 ] ) in the region @xmath47",
    "we expand the field @xmath63 in powers of radial coordinate @xmath51 so that the solution takes the form of mellin transform ( r,,)=12i_d2-i^d2+i d r^- _ ( , )  , where the functions @xmath64 satisfy the massive wave equation on @xmath50-dimensional de sitter space , ( ^2_ds -m^2_)_(,)=0  ,   m^2_=(d- ) )  .",
    "the important question is the range for the spectral parameter @xmath65 .",
    "a typical configuration in the field theory is a plane wave for which the relevant spectral parameter is complex , @xmath66 , with @xmath67 changing from minus to plus infinity .",
    "this explains the choice of the limits in the integral ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "later on , the parameter @xmath65 is identified with the conformal weight of the dual operator .",
    "mass term in ( [ 4 ] ) is real and positive , @xmath68 , in this case .",
    "notice that in general the field @xmath69 can be a superposition of propagating modes as well as solitonic configurations .",
    "the coulomb - like potential would be an example of a configuration which requires inclusion in ( [ 3 ] ) of terms with real values of @xmath65 .",
    "indeed , in @xmath70 space - time dimensions the coulomb - like configuration = qr^d-1()^d-1 corresponds to @xmath71 .",
    "we will see that similarly we have to include both complex and real @xmath65 in the gravitational case in order to describe both the gravitational waves and black holes . for description of the latter the purely real @xmath65 are appropriate .",
    "notice also that in the case @xmath72 the two independent solutions to the radial differential equation ( [ 2 ] ) are @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the representation ( [ 3 ] ) is the first step in the holographic reduction : it reduces the quantum field in minkowski space to a ( infinite ) set of massive fields living on de sitter space of one dimension lower .",
    "as we have discussed in the beginning of this section each de sitter slice has two boundaries , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the next step thus would be to relate each solution of the equation ( [ 4 ] ) to the boundary values of the functions @xmath64 . since on the de sitter space the boundary value problem is in fact the initial value problem the boundary data should be specified on the surface @xmath59 .",
    "the general solution of eq.([4 ] ) is expressed in terms of @xmath75- and @xmath76-legendre functions ( see appendix b ) & & _ ( , ) = ( ) ^1-d 2[a()p_(d-1)2-^ 2(-i)o_^ > ( ) + & & + b()q_(d-1)2-^ 2(-i ) o^ < _ ( ) ]  , where the `` constants '' @xmath77 and @xmath78 can be chosen in a way to remove the non - locality in the leading term when expression ( [ phi ] ) is expanded in powers of @xmath79 .    the expansion in powers of @xmath80 could be used as an alternative way to solve the equation ( [ 4 ] ) . the coefficients in front of terms",
    "@xmath81 and @xmath82 in this expansion are not determined from the equation : these are the initial data to be specified on @xmath59 .",
    "in the form ( [ phi ] ) of the solution these are the functions @xmath83 and @xmath84 which form the `` boundary '' data . combining this expansion with the integral representation ( [ 3 ] )",
    "we find that to the leading order near the sphere @xmath59 the solution to the field equation ( [ 2 ] ) in minkowski space reads ( r,,)=12i_d2-i^d2+i d(r^- e^(d- ) + + r^- e^ )  , where the higher order terms in the expansion are uniquely determined by @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath84 and @xmath85 are thus the holographic data which are needed to be specified at the sphere @xmath59 for the reconstruction of the scalar field everywhere in the region @xmath86 .",
    "these functions can be also associated with the left- and right - moving waves .",
    "the sphere @xmath59 lies in the intersection of two null - hypersurfaces : the past null infinity @xmath87 and the past light - cone @xmath88 .",

    "similar analysis can be done for the solution near the sphere @xmath58 in the future of the de sitter slices .",
    "a similar infinite set of functions could be specified there . in the quantum mechanical picture",
    "the data on the future sphere @xmath58 can be associated with the quantum out - state while the data specified on @xmath59 form the quantum in - state . in the cft / minkowski duality proposed in @xcite",

    "things are slightly different inside the light - cone , for instance in the region @xmath49 inside the past light - cone .",
    "one needs to specify only one set of functions , namely @xmath93 there . or , equivalently",
    ", only a single function on the past null - infinity ( more precisely , on that component of @xmath87 which is inside the past light - cone ) should be specified .",
    "this is quite obvious since @xmath87 forms a cauchy surface in the region @xmath94 . in this region",
    "the solution to the cauchy problem can be brought to a nice integral form @xcite & & ( t , y,)=12i_d2-i^d2+i d ( -t)^-_s^-_dd()g_(y,, ) o_( ) + & & g_(y,,)=g()^  , where @xmath95 is some normalization factor , @xmath96 is the measure on d - sphere .",

    "a possible way to solve the gravitational equations ( [ 8 ] ) subject to this asymptotic condition is to expand the metric in powers of distance from the sphere ( somewhat analogously to what has been done in the case of asymptotically anti - de sitter space ) .",

    "let us summarize our rather long analysis .",
    "the metric perturbation over minkowski space has been represented in the form @xmath297 where sum over @xmath65 may contain also integral as it happens when @xmath296 with continuous @xmath67 .",

    "the function @xmath331 is arbitrary and @xmath332 is defined as @xmath333 as we have already seen , the @xmath154 case ( minkowski space - time has physical dimension 4 ) is in many respects special .",
    "equation ( [ 5.5 ] ) indicates another peculiarity of @xmath154 .",
    "quite surprisingly , the @xmath51-expansion of the schwarzschild metric starts with the term with logarithm , @xmath334 .",
    "we see also that both in ( [ 5.5 ] ) and ( [ 5.6 ] ) the mass makes its first appearance at the level @xmath71 . to make connection with our notations",

    "we see that components ( [ 5.8 ] ) are what we called the inhomogeneous part ( [ m14 ] ) of the perturbation while the homogeneous part vanishes identically in ( [ 5.8 ] ) .",
    "notice also that the @xmath71 solution to the radial differential equations corresponds to mass term @xmath336 .",
    "the second independent solution is the one with @xmath136 . in the case",
    "d=2 the two independent solutions which correspond to the mass term @xmath159 are @xmath337 and @xmath51 .",
    "we see that in the expansion ( [ 5.6 ] ) there appear both independent solutions corresponding to @xmath336 : the @xmath71 term ( @xmath337 term in d=2 case ) contains information about the mass of gravitational configuration while the @xmath136 term contains an arbitrary function of @xmath338 .",
    "freedom in the choice of this function is apparently a manifestation of the gauge symmetry ( [ gauge ] ) appearing exactly at the level @xmath136 . comparing ( [ 5.8 ] ) with our analysis in section 4.2.3",
    "we can single out the primary element in the holographic data which contains the information about the mass .",
    "we find that it is the function @xmath339 which is proportional to the mass @xmath321 and brings the dependence on @xmath321 into all metric components .",
    "generically , @xmath340 ( defined in ( [ m4 ] ) ) is a source for the vector @xmath286 via equation ( [ m14 * ] ) .",
    "but in the case @xmath136 the coefficient in front of the source vanishes and @xmath286 is divergence - free . on the other hand ,",
    "the current @xmath286 plays the role of the source for @xmath291 ( [ m15 ] ) and since @xmath286 is conserved it means that @xmath291 is partially conserved .",

    "but they would be non - trivial in the general case of dynamical situation when there is flow of energy coming through the past null - infinity .",
    "it is certainly interesting to analyze how information about the flow is encoded in the holographic data .",
    "minkowski space - time can be reconstructed from some data specified on the boundary of light - cone .",
    "this works in a fashion similar to the known holographic reconstruction of asymptotically anti - de sitter space from the boundary data . in the latter case",
    "the holographic pair consists on metric representing the conformal class on the boundary and the stress - tensor of the boundary theory . in the present case",
    "since infinitely many ads and ds slices end at the boundary of the light - cone we should expect that infinitely many stress - tensors need to be specified there .",
    "also , since the data should represent the ( d+2)-dimensional physics which does not confine to the boundary only , these stress - tensors are not expected to be conserved .",
    "rather they should satisfy the ward identities as required by the coordinate invariance .",
    "indeed , what we have found is the chains of holographic operators that can be represented as follows @xmath341 and @xmath342 the label @xmath65 parameterizes the infinite family of such operators .",
    "another expectation is that in the dual theory the central charge ( coming naively from the radius of each ( a)ds slice ) should be continuous function perhaps parameterized by @xmath65 so that each stress - tensor in the infinite family should have its own central charge .",
    "however , we do not see this in our analysis since all tensors @xmath291 and @xmath290 are traceless . of course",
    ", these tensors represent only the linearized part of the stress - tensors in the full non - linear problem . but that they are traceless in the linear order",
    "may indicate that the central charge is well - defined in the dual theory independently of @xmath65 .",
    "this should be further investigated . from the gravitational perspective",
    "the above sets of operators represent the bulk gravitational dynamics and should describe the mass , angular momentum and the energy flow .",
    "the latter can be due to gravitational waves and is likely to be represented by the holographic operators with complex @xmath65 .",
