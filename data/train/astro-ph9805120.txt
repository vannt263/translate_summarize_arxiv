    "the inability of the visible mass components in disk galaxies to account for the observed rotation curves is usually interpreted as evidence for the existence of an additional , invisible mass component .",
    "other theories suggest that this mass discrepancy is an indication of a breakdown of classical newtonian dynamics .",
    "it is difficult to evaluate these theories , as only a few make specific and testable predictions .",
    "one of the exceptions is the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) , advocated by milgrom ( 1983 , 1989 ) and sanders ( 1990 , 1996 ) .",
    "this theory postulates that newton s law of gravity should be modified for very small accelerations , with the result that any need for dark matter disappears .",
    "fits to rotation curves of hsb galaxies using mond are of equal quality as the fits made using a dark matter halo ( see sanders 1996 ) .",
    "mond is however also able to satisfactorily explain observations of the dynamics of e.g.  dwarf galaxies and dwarf spheroidals ( see the discussion in milgrom 1995 , and also mcgaugh & de blok ( 1998b ) [ hereafter paper ii ] ) .    for a complete description of mond , its predictions , and observational results",
    "we refer to milgrom ( 1983 , 1989 ) , sanders ( 1990 ) , begeman , broeils and sanders ( 1991 ) , bekenstein & milgrom ( 1984 ) and sanders ( 1996 ) . an extensive description of mond results in the context of lsb galaxies is given in paper ii .",
    "mond assumes that the force law changes from the conventional newtonian form when the acceleration of a test particle is much smaller than a limiting acceleration @xmath0 , where @xmath0 is a universal constant .",
    "thus , while the normal newtonian acceleration @xmath1 which a mass @xmath2 exerts on a test particle at distance @xmath3 is identical to the true test - particle acceleration @xmath4 for accelerations @xmath5 , in the mond limit ( i.e. , @xmath6 ) the implied newtonian acceleration is related to the true test - particle acceleration @xmath4 by @xmath7 .",
    "the acceleration @xmath0 is a fundamental parameter in the mond theory . from rotation curve fitting to high - quality rotation curves ,",
    "begeman et al .  (",
    "1991 ) determined a value of @xmath8 m s@xmath9 ( for @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 , which we adopt throughout this paper ) .",
    "as described in paper ii , lsb galaxies provide a strong test of mond .",
    "their low surface densities imply accelerations @xmath12 , which means that these galaxies should be almost completely in the mond regime .",
    "milgrom ( 1983 , 1989 ) made a number of testable predictions on the shapes of rotation curves , and noted that low surface density galaxies should have slowly rising rotation curves .",
    "this expectation of mond is confirmed by the observed rotation curves . in newtonian terms",
    "this translates in these galaxies having large mass discrepancies ( mcgaugh & de blok 1998 , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "this brings us to one of the more pronounced differences between mond and classical newtonian dynamics , which is the explanation of the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation . as is described in detail in paper i ( see also zwaan et al .",
    "1995 ) , the fact that lsb galaxies are observed to obey the same tf relation as hsb galaxies implies a strong coupling between the central surface brightnesses of the disks of galaxies and their total mass - to - light ratios ( which include dark matter ) . assuming standard newtonian dynamics this implies that lsb galaxies have a higher total mass ( within the disk radius ) than hsb galaxies of the same asymptotic velocity .",
    "it is hard to derive this result in the standard context without a lot of fine - tuning .",
    "mond _ predicts _ that all galaxies should fall on one _ mass_-velocity relation , which takes the form @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the asymptotic velocity and @xmath2 is the total mass of the galaxy ( that is , the mass of stars and gas ) .",
    "once the value of @xmath0 is fixed , this relation becomes absolute and can be tested and falsified .",
    "we use the rotation curves of 15 lsb galaxies to do a mond analysis .",
    "section  2 describes the fitting procedure .",
    "section  3 presents the results . in sect .",
    "4 we discuss whether mond can fit any rotation curve , and we present our conclusions in sect .",
    "in this paper we fit the rotation curves of the sample of 15 lsb galaxies presented in van der hulst et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , de blok , mcgaugh & van der hulst ( 1996 ) and de blok & mcgaugh ( 1997 ) using the mond prescription .",
    "we refer to these papers for a description of the properties of lsb galaxies and their rotation curves .",
    "the rotation curves were fitted following the procedure outlined in begeman et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and sanders ( 1996 ) . to be consistent with the results presented in sanders ( 1996 ) we have assumed that the stars and the gas are both in an infinitesimally thin disk ( for our purposes this assumption has no appreciable impact on the stellar rotation curve",
    " see broeils 1992 ) .",
    "the newtonian rotation curves of the visible components ( stars and hi ) were determined first .",
    "the rotation curve of the stars was computed assuming that the mass - to - light ratio of the stars @xmath15 is constant with radius .",
    "the rotation curve of the gas was computed using the radial hi surface density profile , after multiplying this by 1.4 to take the contribution of he into account .",
    "we ignore any molecular gas : observations suggest that lsb galaxies contain only small amounts of molecular gas ( schombert et al .  1990 , knezek 1993 , de blok & van der hulst 1998 ) .",
    "with the newtonian accelerations known , the mond acceleration can be computed ( see paper ii ) and the observed rotation curves fitted using a least - squares program .",
    "the fitting procedure has three free parameters : the distance @xmath16 to the galaxy ; the mass - to - light ratio of the stellar disk @xmath15 ; and the value of the constant @xmath0 .",
    "as @xmath0 is supposed to be a universal constant we fix it at the value determined in begeman et al .",
    "as the lsb galaxies investigated here are sufficiently far away that the redshift is a fair indicator of the distance , we take the distance @xmath16 to be fixed at the values given in de blok et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , assuming @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "this leaves @xmath15 as the _ only _ free parameter . for very gas",
    "rich galaxies , there are effectively no free parameters , as the dynamics are completely dominated by the gas component , and the contribution of the stars can be ignored for any reasonable value of @xmath15 .",
    "the rotation curves and mond fits are presented in fig .  [ rotcurves ] and",
    "table  1 . of the sample presented in de blok & mcgaugh ( 1997 )",
    "we have not used f571 - 8 and f571-v2 .",
    "f571 - 8 is an edge - on galaxy , and as the fits depend crucially on the photometric profile , the simple analysis done in de blok et al .",
    "( 1996 ) does not suffice here ( due to uncertainties in the extinction ; see barnaby & thronson 1994 ) . for f571-v2",
    "no photometry is available .",
    "the results presented in table  1 differ slightly from those presented in paper  ii .",
    "this is because we now fit the entire shape of the rotation curve , rather than just the asymptotic velocity .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ rotcurves ] a good fit to the rotation curve was readily found for the majority of the galaxies .",
    "these fits are shown in the two left - most columns in fig .",
    "[ rotcurves ] .",
    "the ease with which these one - parameter fits were obtained is remarkable , especially if one keeps in mind that in lsb galaxies the dynamics are often dominated by the gas rather than the stars .",
    "this severely limits the possible values for @xmath15 and the freedom the mond recipe has to produce a good fit .    for",
    "6 galaxies a good fit did not occur trivially .",
    "the corresponding `` bad '' fits are shown in the third column in fig .",
    "[ rotcurves ] . were we to stop here , we would have to claim to have falsified mond in spite of many good fits and confirmed predictions .",
    "it is therefore necessary to examine the uncertainties in the data before making such a radical step .    for each galaxy",
    "there are two parameters which might affect our ability to obtain a fit .",
    "one is the distance to the galaxy @xmath16 and the second is the inclination of the galaxy @xmath17 ( @xmath0 is supposed to be a universal parameter , and varying it from galaxy to galaxy would be against the spirit of mond ) .",
    "we have made two - parameter fits to the 6 `` bad '' curves with @xmath15 and @xmath16 free .",
    "the results are shown in table 2 .",
    "expect for ugc 5999 we find that a two - parameter fit prefers smaller distances which are typically @xmath18 per cent of the original distance .",
    "as the galaxies are not near virgo and have a sufficiently large redshift that this is a fair indicator of the distance , we think it is unlikely that these fits show a realistic picture .",
    "a closer study of the fits shows that the distance factor is almost entirely caused by the fit overestimating the rotation velocity in the outer parts ( cf . third column in fig .",
    "[ rotcurves ] ) .",
    "this is caused by the gas - rotation curve having relatively high velocities in the outer parts . in order to accomodate the rotation curve of the stellar disk ,",
    "the fitting procedure tries to reduce the amplitude of the gas - rotation curve by reducing the gas mass , i.e. , it brings the galaxy in closer .    with @xmath16 free reasonable values of @xmath15 between 0.5 and 3",
    "are obtained .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that the amplitude of the gas - rotation curve in the outer parts essentially forces us to adopt a particular value of @xmath16 , and consequently also forces us to adopt a value of @xmath15 .",
    "therefore we can not use @xmath16 to improve the fits .",
    "the inclinations of lsb galaxies are difficult to constrain from the shapes of their outer isophotes ( mcgaugh & bothun 1994 ; de blok et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 ) . yet",
    "this is essentially the only information we have which is independent of the kinematics .    the total rotation curve and the rotation curves of the stars and the gas each depend differently on the inclination .",
    "the total rotation velocity can be derived from the observed rotation velocity by @xmath19 .",
    "the rotation velocity of the gas and stars needs to be derived from the true surface density , which in turn is determined from the observed surface density @xmath20 , so that @xmath21 .",
    "the different dependencies on @xmath17 will change the ratios between the total rotation curve and the stellar and gas rotation curves .",
    "changes of only a few degrees can have quite noticeable effects for relatively face - on galaxies .",
    "if the inclination is under - estimated , the inclination - corrected observed velocities are too high .",
    "the gas contribution , which dominates in the outer parts , has no scaling factor built in , and is therefore unable to fit these velocities .",
    "this can be compensated for by using a larger value of @xmath15 , but this will result in a model rotation curve with the wrong shape , as it will overestimate the velocity in the inner parts by a large factor .",
    "the effects of over - estimating the inclination are the reverse . the inclination - corrected observed velocities are too low , so that the rotation curve of the gas alone suffices to fit the data in the outer parts . consequently only a very modest or even zero or negative value of @xmath15 is needed .",
    "this again results in a model curve with the wrong shape : too low velocities in the inner parts , and too high in the outer parts .",
    "there is only a narrow range in inclination where both the inner and outer parts are fit equally well .    in deriving the best value for the inclination we first changed the inclinations in a systematic way starting from the initial value from de blok et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and rederived the mass models for each value of the inclination .",
    "we used the @xmath22 value to select a range of inclinations that yielded good fits .",
    "this range was then narrowed by inspecting these fits by eye , and choosing those fits that most closely mimicked the behaviour of the high - resolution fits presented in sanders ( 1996 ) .",
    "this means that the newtonian rotation curve of the stellar disk should be able to describe the innermost one - third of the rising part of the observed rotation curve . in practice the values for the inclination that were determined in that way",
    "are constrained to typically within 4 degrees .",
    "we now discuss on a case - by - case basis the validity of changing the inclination in these 6 galaxies .",
    "the two right - most columns in fig .",
    "[ rotcurves ] show the original and revised fits of these two galaxies .",
    "figure  [ pics ] shows slightly smoothed optical @xmath23-band pictures of the 6 galaxies with ellipses superimposed whose axis ratios correspond to the original assumed inclination and the derived mond inclination .",
    "the mond inclination values are also given in table  1 .",
    "[ [ f565-v2 ] ] f565-v2    at the original inclination of 60 degrees no fit with @xmath24 could be made .",
    "the inclination needs to be changed to 44 degrees before positive @xmath15 values are produced by the fitting procedure .",
    "the best fitting mond value is 31 degrees .",
    "this might mean that we are missing a face - on lsb disk underlying the elongated structure we now observe as the galaxy .",
    "finding such a lsb disk will be made difficult by the presence of a bright star just outside the region shown ( cf .",

    "1996 ) .",

    "note that the quality of the fit for this face - on system depends critically on the inclination .",
    "using mond to fit the rotation curve of a face - on galaxy could actually tie down its inclination to within a few degrees .",

    "the implied stellar mass - to - light ratio is not reasonable , and both galaxies have rather high , well determined inclinations so that adjusting the inclination within the errors will not have an impact on the procedure . in the dark matter case",
    "one _ can _ reach a very tolerable fit , which is comparable in quality with the fit of the real ngc 2403 ( see begeman , broeils and sanders 1991 , their fig .  1 ) .",
    "the conclusion we can reach from this is that mond can _ not _ fit any arbitrary rotation curve , dispelling the myth which asserts it was designed to do just this .",
    "mond was designed to produce an asymptotically flat rotation curve , but this is no guarantee that the application of the mond force law to the observed luminous mass distribution will obtain the correct shape for just any rotation curve .",
    "there must be a very close relation between the observed mass distribution and the rotation curve ( both of which can be determined independently ) , and this relation must be the mond recipe if one wants to derive the latter solely from the former .",
    "the good fits to lsb galaxies rotation curves support mond , especially so as these are galaxies with large mass discrepancies in their observed disks , where the mond effects are strongest .",
    "the mond fits furthermore _",
    "test _ the mond theory .",
    "this is not the case with dark matter fits , where the properties of the dark matter discrepancy are _ derived _ from the fits .",
    "these fits _ define _ the properties of the mass discrepancy . it is therefore not possible to falsify nor confirm the dark matter hypothesis from rotation curves alone , as can be done with the mond hypothesis .",
    "we show this by fitting a hypothetical non - physical galaxy : the mond theory is unable to produce a good fit ( which in this case is a good thing ) , whereas we can get a good fit with the dark matter theory ( showing it is more flexible in fitting non - physical models ) .    in principle , there are an infinite number of things the rotation curves of galaxies could do given the presence of an invisible mass component .",
    "there are many plausible predictions for what they are expected to do given various ideas about dark matter . in the case of mond",
    ", there is one and only one thing rotation curves can do .",
    "this is precisely what they do .",
    "one last remarkable result is the great efficiency with which mond can describe the rotation curves of galaxies of very different types .",
    "even if mond is ultimately falsified , it would still be worth knowing why it works so well . until a mond cosmology can be derived ( see sanders 1998 )",
    "it remains a recipe for describing rotation curves , but as a recipe it is far superior to the dark halo recipe , and this raises the question of _ why _ mond works so well .",
    "mond is after all only a simple analytic formula which gets @xmath69 correct based solely on the luminous mass .",
    "if the mond phenomenology arises as the result of dark matter , then this would imply that the dark matter must `` know '' about both the distribution of light _ and _ the mond formula , and arrange itself appropriately , right down to amplifying the bumps and wiggles in the stellar and gas rotation curves by the appropriate amount .",
