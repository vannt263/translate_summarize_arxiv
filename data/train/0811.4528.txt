    ".    in our simulation all the particles start its motion in the given time .",
    "since we do nt include the back - reaction from the particles to the electromagnetic field in our simulations , time - integral of energy spectra at each time - slice gives the steady state energy spectra .",
    "this steady state spectrum is also shown in figure [ energy - spectrum - age ] with thick curve .",
    "the nonthermal component has @xmath88 power - law spectrum that meets the observational requirement mentioned in section [ introduction ] .",
    "we can also estimate the `` injection rate '' to be the proportion of particles that have more than @xmath89 of energy after 1 years . for @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 ,",
    "the injection rate was @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 , respectively.the other parameters are @xmath98 , @xmath48 and @xmath99 .    in figure [ dsa - map ]",
    "we show for all the parameter range the ratio of the particle numbers that were accelerated to have energy greater than @xmath100 .",
    "we see that the acceleration is most efficient at polar region ( @xmath101 ) when @xmath102",
    ". we can understand this dependence of the spectra with background fluid parameters as follows ; particles are trapped in larmor motion and tend to move in direction of @xmath6 . thus particles more easily cross the shockfront when @xmath6 is parallel to shock normal .",
    "if the turbulence amplitude is much weaker , fewer particles get reflected by pitch angle scattering , and fermi acceleration is suppressed .",
    "the injection is more efficient for smaller @xmath79 , because more energy is distributed to modes with smallest wavelengths which are resonant with the thermal particles .",
    "if a spherical shock emerges in a uniform mean magnetic field , there are two polar region where the mean magnetic field is parallel to the shock normal , and the equatorial region has the mean magnetic field perpendicular to the shock normal .",
    "thus , we expect the fermi acceleration process to be only active in the pair of polar region .",
    "this might explain the bipolar structure we see at sn 1006 .",
    "we have also checked the acceleration rate in three - dimensional(isotropic ) , rather than one - dimensional(anisotropic ) distribution of @xmath103 .",
    "we have found that less significant dependence of injection rate on @xmath84 with larger @xmath4 .",
    "we can interpret this as follows ; if the turbulence spectrum is isotropic and the maximum turbulence wavelength is large , turbulence modes with largest wavelength and strongest amplitude play the role of local @xmath6 .",
    "thus we observe almost isotropic fermi acceleration .",
    "this might explain the many snrs with no typical orientation .",
    "is the longest wavelength of the turbulence modes , @xmath104 is the ratio of turbulent magnetic field to unperturbed magnetic field , @xmath84 is the angle between shock normal and @xmath6 . ]",
    "some might question the validity of @xmath4 value much greater than unity .",
    "however , @xcite observed extremely fast varying x - ray images at snr rx j1713.7 - 3946 .",
    "their observation may indicate that magnetic field is locally enhanced up to @xmath105 in @xmath106 year in snr , which corresponds to @xmath107 case in our model .",
    "our simulations suggest that such fast - variating spots in snrs might be the sites of galactic @xmath108 cosmic ray acceleration .",
    "although we have ignored many of the fourier modes by adopting @xmath17 space discretization of the turbulence spectrum , the validity of the approximation can be argued in many ways .",
    "most importantly we have confirmed that our measure in @xmath17 space lead to convergence .",
    "figure [ energy - spectrum - convergence ] shows energy spectra for @xmath31 , with increasing @xmath109 .",
    "turbulent cascade , from which the very turbulence arises , is by nature a logarithmic process : a mode of a certain wavelength couples with the mode of half the wavelength by nonlinear term of euler equation .",
    "first order fermi acceleration also is a logarithmic process : particles gain energy as an exponential function of shock crossing number @xmath12 . all these reason combined , waves in logarithmically discretized wavenumber space act as a sufficient ladder to carry up cosmic ray particles .",
