    "<S> @xmath5 is measured with respect to one of the charge neutrality ( dirac ) points and @xmath6 is the strength of dimensionless bare interaction . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we also demonstrate that the so - obtained multilogarithmic singularity is reconcilable with the perturbative expansion of @xmath0 in powers of the bare interaction .    </S>",
