    "it is well - known that , by adjusting the attractive coupling strength among the constituents , a fermion system may undergo a smooth crossover from the bardeen - cooper - shriffer ( bcs ) superfluidity / superconductivity in degenerate fermion gas to the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of composite molecules .",
    "such a bcs - bec crossover is theoretically due to the fact that the wave functions of bcs and bec ground states are essentially the same@xcite .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover is expected to be realized in high temperature superconductor and atomic fermion gas@xcite via using an external magnetic field to change the s - wave scattering length@xcite .    the superconductivity in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , i.e. , the color superconductivity@xcite , is naturally considered as a system to study the relativistic bcs - bec crossover . due to the asymptotic property of qcd , there may exist a crossover from the bcs superconductivity with weakly bound quark pairs at high baryon density to the bec state of composite hadrons at low baryon density@xcite .",
    "such a bcs - bec crossover in qcd may also be realized in chiral condensed matter@xcite and in pion superfluid@xcite . at moderate baryon density , while a diquark bec state may not be realized due to the chiral symmetry restoration , the attractive coupling strength is obviously not located in the weak coupling region .",
    "it is shown in many effective qcd models that , the quark energy gap at moderate baryon density is about @xmath1 mev@xcite which is already of the order of the fermi energy .",
    "the strong coupling in this case may induce a so - called pseudogap effect , which has been investigated in two flavor color superconductivity above the critical temperature@xcite .",
    "a natural question is how the pseudogap modifies the critical temperature and thermodynamics of the color superconductor . to answer this question",
    ", one needs to construct a relativistic theory at finite temperature which can describe the pseudogap and possible bcs - bec crossover .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover in relativistic fermion systems are recently investigated in the nozieres ",
    "schmitt - rink ( nsr ) theory above the critical temperature@xcite , the boson - fermion model@xcite and the bcs - leggett mean field theory at zero temperature@xcite .",
    "it is shown that , not only the bcs superfluidity and the non - relativistic bec ( nbec ) of heavy molecules but also the nbec and the relativistic bec ( rbec ) of nearly massless molecules can be smoothly connected . in the rbec state , anti - fermion pairs ( anti - bosons ) are excited and become nearly degenerate with fermion pairs ( bosons ) . from the nsr theory at @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the critical temperature ,",
    "the difference between the nbec@xcite and rbec@xcite states is significant@xcite .",
    "it is widely known that , at zero temperature the mean field theory is a good approximation to describe the bcs - bec crossover@xcite , and the pair fluctuations can be safely neglected even at strong coupling . only around the unitary limit , i.e. , the infinite scattering length limit , the pair fluctuations are somewhat important to obtain a proper value of the universal constant@xcite . in our previous paper@xcite ,",
    "we investigated the generalization from non - relativistic to relativistic bcs - bec crossover at zero temperature in the bcs - leggett mean field theory .",
    "at finite temperature , however , the condensed pairs with zero momentum can be thermally excited , and one should go beyond the mean field approximation to treat properly the uncondensed pairs@xcite .",
    "there exist many methods to treat pair fluctuations at finite temperature . in the nsr theory , which is also called @xmath4 theory ,",
    "the pair fluctuations enter only the number equation , and the fermion loops which appear in the pair propagator are constructed by bare green function @xmath5 . as a consequence ,",
    "such a theory is in principle not self - consistent and is valid only at @xmath6 . for the study of bcs - bec crossover",
    ", one needs a theory which is valid not only above the critical temperature but also in the symmetry breaking phase .",
    "while such a strict theory is not yet reached so far , some t - matrix approaches are recently developed , see for instance @xcite . among them , the asymmetric pair approximation or the so - called @xmath7 scheme@xcite is a competitive one .",
    "the effect of the pair fluctuations in the @xmath7 method is treated as a fermion pesudogap which has been widely discussed in high temperature superconductivity .",
    "in contrast to the nsr theory ( @xmath8 scheme ) , the @xmath0 scheme is self - consistent and keeps the ward identity@xcite .    in the study of color superconductivity at moderate density ,",
    "the color condensed phase is of great interest .",
    "the nsr theory@xcite , which seems valid in the normal phase , can only predict the transition temperature of color superconductivity .",
    "a necessary task in this field of research is to develop a relativistic bcs - bec crossover theory in the symmetry breaking phase . in this paper",
    ", we will generalize the @xmath0 scheme to relativistic fermion systems .",
    "a necessary requirement for such a generalization is to recover the non - relativistic limit@xcite and mean field limit@xcite properly . with this theory",
    ", we can calculate the critical temperature @xmath3 for arbitrary coupling and describe the bcs - nbec - rbec crossover at finite temperature .",
    "it , as an application , can be used to study the pseudogap effect on color superconductivity .",
