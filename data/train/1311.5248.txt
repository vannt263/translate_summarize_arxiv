    "a number of relaxed , cool - core clusters of galaxies are known to host centrally - located , diffuse synchrotron radio emission in their cores , that typically fills the cooling region ( @xmath3 kpc ) . these extended radio sources  called minihalos  have very low surface brightness and possess steep radio spectra , @xmath4 ( for @xmath5 ) .",
    "their emission usually encompasses the radio source associated with the cluster dominant galaxy , but extends to much greater radii .",
    "only about ten clusters have confirmed minihalos .",
    "these include the prototype minihalo in the perseus cluster ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* sijbring 1993 ) , whose emission occupies a large volume of the cool core , much larger than the inner @xmath6 kpc region occupied by the well - known x - ray cavities filled by the lobes of 3c84 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the origin of radio minihalos is unclear .",
    "even though minihalos have active galaxies in their centers , the time needed by the electrons to diffuse from the galaxy across the cooling region ( @xmath7 years ) is much longer than the radiative cooling timescale ( @xmath8 years ) for @xmath9 electrons that emit at the observed radio frequencies in the strong magnetic fields of the cool cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , _ in situ _ production or reacceleration of relativistic electrons is required to explain minihalos .",
    "one possibility is inelastic collisions between relativistic cosmic ray protons and thermal protons , which can provide a continous injection of relativistic electrons .",
    "alternatively , reacceleration models posit that the radio synchrotron emission arises from pre - existing , cooled relativistic electrons ( for instance , injected by past activity of the central radio galaxy and/or hadronic collisions ) that are reaccelerated to ultra - relativistic energies by turbulence in the intracluster medium ( icm ) .    a key question for the latter scenario is the origin of the turbulence responsible for accelerating the electrons .",
    "an interesting possibility is that it is induced by sloshing gas motions , detected using high - resolution x - ray observations in the cool cores of most relaxed clusters .",
    "the observational signature of these motions is the spiral- or arc - shaped cold fronts .",
    "these are believed to be contact discontinuities at the bounderies of the dense cool core that is sloshing in the deep potential well of the cluster in response to , e.g. , a gravitational perturbation caused by the infall of a small subcluster @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that sloshing can generate significant turbulence in the core .",
    "the existence of a possible connection between gas sloshing and radio minihalos was first hinted at by the discovery of a spatial correlation of the minihalo with x - ray cold fronts in two clusters @xcite , where the diffuse radio emission appears confined to the region bounded by the fronts .",
    "a similar correlation is also observed in the perseus cluster ( markevitch et al . in preparation ) .",
    "@xcite used simulations to test the possibility of accelerating relativistic electrons via sloshing - driven turbulence .",
    "though theoretical uncertainties are large , they found that turbulence can be strong enough to reaccelerate low-@xmath10 electrons to higher energies ( @xmath11 ) and produce diffuse radio emission with morphology , radio power and spectral index consistent with actual minihalos .",
    "however , despite theoretical effort , our understanding of the origin and physical properties of minihalos and their relation to the cluster core dynamics is still limited by the small number of known objects .",
    "we undertook a search for new minihalos in a large sample of galaxy clusters that combines radio observations from the _ very large array _ ( _ vla _ ) archive and _ giant metrewave radio telescope _ ( _ gmrt _ ; proprietary and archival ) along with x - ray data from the _ chandra _ archive . in this paper , we present new minihalos ( and several candidates requiring better data for confirmation ) found during re - analysis of the _ vla _ observations . statistical analysis of the cluster sample and detailed radio / x - ray study of specific interesting cases will be presented in forthcoming papers .",

    "indeed , in the strong magnetic fields expected in the cool cores , the radio - emitting electrons can not diffuse from the central radio galaxy out to the minihalo radius within their radiative lifetime , which is amost two orders of magnitude shorter than their diffusion timescale ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the typical diffusion velocity of relativistic electrons in clusters is expected to be approximately the alfvn velocity @xcite @xmath384 , where @xmath385 is the cluster magnetic field and @xmath386 is the density of the icm .",
    "although our knowledge of the magnetic field in clusters is still poor , studies of the rotation measure of radio galaxies in or behind clusters indicate that the magnetic field intensity in cool cores can be as high as @xmath387 @xmath33 g or even stronger ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this is similar to what is seen , for instance , at the center of the ngc1407 group @xcite .",
    "the different orientation of the low- and high - frequency extended structures may also indicate two different ( past ) radio outbursts that occurred at different jet angles .",
    "on the other hand , the x - ray data indicate that the core of macsj1931.82634 is sloshing in the n - s direction . for a similar sloshing configuration ,",
    "the simulated minihalo maps by @xcite strikingly resemble the radio emission seen at center of macsj1931.82634 ( see their figure 11 ) : the diffuse emission tends to be distributed in two bright regions symmetrical with respect to the cluster center and aligned in a direction roughly perpendicular to the axis of sloshing .",
    "the source in zwcl1742.1 + 3306 could also be classified as a restarted radio galaxy . however , no detailed spectral information is available to rule out the minihalo interpretation .",
    "we notice that the source is only @xmath398 kpc in radius and , as discussed in  [ sec : reacc ] , electron reacceleration may not be needed to explain the presence of diffuse emission on such a scale . if relativistic electrons have been injected by the central agn during a former cycle of activity and accumulated in two radio bubbles , it is possible that ongoing sloshing motions have disrupted such bubbles and carried the aged , but still radio - emitting , electrons throughout the sloshing region . thus",

    "<S> cool cores of some galaxy clusters exhibit faint radio `` minihalos . '' </S>",

    "<S> we undertook a systematic search for minihalos in a large sample of x - ray luminous clusters with high - quality radio data . in this paper , we report four new minihalos ( a478 , zwcl3146 , rxj1532.9 + 3021 and a2204 ) , and five candidates , found in the reanalyzed archival _ very large array _ observations . </S>",
    "<S> the radio luminosities of our minihalos and candidates are in the range @xmath0 w hz@xmath1 at 1.4 ghz , consistent with this type of radio sources . </S>",
    "<S> their sizes ( @xmath2 kpc in radius ) are somewhat smaller than those of the previously known minihalos . </S>",
    "<S> we combine our new detections with previously known minihalos , obtaining a total sample of 21 objects , and briefly compare the cluster radio properties to the average x - ray temperature and the total masses estimated from _ </S>",
    "<S> planck_. we find that nearly all clusters hosting minihalos are hot and massive . beyond that </S>",
    "<S> , there is no clear correlation between the minihalo radio power and cluster temperature or mass ( in contrast with the _ giant _ radio halos found in cluster mergers , whose radio luminosity correlates with the cluster mass ) . </S>",
    "<S> _ chandra _ x - ray images indicate gas sloshing in the cool cores of most of our clusters , with minihalos contained within the sloshing regions in many of them . </S>",

    "<S> advection of relativistic electrons by the sloshing gas may also play a role in the formation of the less - extended minihalos . </S>"
