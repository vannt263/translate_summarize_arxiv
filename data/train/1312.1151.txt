    "in 1998 , based on astrophysical data , some evidences indicating that the expansion of the universe has been accelerated @xcite , were found . many models have been proposed to describe this odd phenomenon which is still inexplicable in the context of the general reactivity with known matters .",
    "these models may be classified in two categories : ( einstein ) general theory of gravity with an exotic source with negative pressure dubbed as dark energy @xcite , and theories based on modification of general relativity in large scale @xcite .",
    "the most natural and simple candidate for dark energy is the cosmological constant which suffers from fine tuning and coincidence problems , and may not be related to the vacuum energy of the standard particle physics model due to its extremely small value @xcite .",
    "inspired by the inflation theory in the early universe , one can introduce an exotic scalar field dubbed as quintessence playing the role of dark energy @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this model is its dynamics which may solve the coincidence problem and explain the evolution of dark energy density . in this framework , to describe the present acceleration of the universe , the scalar field model with a non - minimal derivative coupling to gravity was proposed in @xcite .",
    "thereafter , the non minimal derivative coupling model has also been employed to describe the possible super acceleration in the late time @xcite .",
    "further studies about this model can be found in @xcite .",
    "although most of the scalar field models use the slow roll conditions to explain the inflation , but as was quoted in @xcite , the acceleration may be continued in the rapid oscillation after the slow roll .",
    "also in @xcite it was tried to introduce the quintessence as a rapid oscillating scalar field . in the rapid oscillation phase the scalar field behaves as a fluid with a _ constant equation of state ( eos ) parameter _ which , by a suitable choice of the potential , becomes enough negative to result in the cosmological acceleration .    in this paper",
    "we consider the spatially flat friedman robertson walker ( frw ) universe in the framework of non minimal derivative coupling model proposed in @xcite .    in the second section",
    "we give an overview of the model and introduce the rapid oscillating scalar field as the quintessence . as in the present time we can not neglect the contribution of dark matter , we generalize the results obtained in @xcite which was derived for a universe consisted only of inflaton .",
    "in contrast to the minimal case , the scalar field acquires a dynamical eos parameter which depends on the hubble parameter .",
    "this enable us to use the continuity equation to study its evolution .",
    "the dependence of the eos parameter on the hubble parameter gives rise to some novel and interesting features such as the possibility that the universe reenters a decelerated expansion without considering any energy exchange between dark matter and dark energy components .",
    "this feature is explained explicitly by deriving a series solution in the third section . in that section",
    "we also obtain the ratio of dark energy and dark matter energy densities at the beginning of the acceleration ( deceleration ) phase . in resemblance to the inflaton decay during its rapid oscillation ,",
    "we consider also the case that the oscillatory quintessence is allowed to exchange energy but only with dark matter alleviating the coincidence problem .",
    "the stability of the model and its late time attractor solutions are discussed . at the end of the third section a short discussion",
    "is given on the instabilities of interacting dark energy model in the perturbed frw universe . in the fourth section ,",
    "our previous results are discussed by using some illustrative examples .",
    "the evolution of dark energy and dark energy are numerically depicted in terms of the redshift parameter and behaviors of the eos parameter of the scalar field and the decelerated parameter of the universe are discussed .",
    "we use units @xmath0 .",
    "we consider the action @xmath1\\sqrt{-g}d^4x+s_m,\\ ] ] describing a scalar field , @xmath2 , whose the kinetic term is coupled to the einstein tensor @xmath3 via the coupling @xmath4 which has inverse - square mass dimension @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 is the matter action containing components other than the scalar field .",
    "@xmath6 is the reduced planck mass , @xmath7 .",
    "the universe is taken to be a spatially flat frw space time , with scale factor @xmath8 .    in the absence of interaction between @xmath2 and other sectors , the equation of motion of the scalar field @xmath9 is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the hubble parameter .",
    "the dark energy density , @xmath12 , and pressure , @xmath13 , are given by @xmath14 satisfying the continuity equation @xmath15 in our study , @xmath16 is an even function specified by the power law form @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "we focus on ( quasiperiodic ) rapidly oscillating scalar field solutions characterized by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the period of the @xmath2 oscillation , and @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath20 is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the amplitude of quasiperiodic oscillation of @xmath2 .",
    "this type of solution was discussed in the literature to study the reheating era after the inflation in the minimal coupling case @xcite . using the friedman equation @xmath24",
    "we find that the total energy density , like the hubble parameter , does not change significantly during one oscillation @xcite",
    "@xmath25    in the non minimal derivative coupling case ( [ 1 ] ) and in high friction regime : @xmath26 , the rapidly oscillating scalar field , following the same steps as @xcite , was studied in details in @xcite(we do not repeat the details here ) in a universe dominated by @xmath2 and in high friction regime @xmath26 , the solution may be represented as @xmath27 , where @xmath23 is the amplitude of the @xmath2 oscillation . like the harmonic oscillation",
    "the energy may be approximated by the energy potential at the tuning points : @xmath28    the period of an oscillation is given ( see @xcite ) @xmath29 rapid oscillation condition ( [ 5 ] ) may now be rewritten as @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "note that @xmath32 can not exceed unity . for @xmath33 ( [ 7 ] ) reduces to the result obtained in minimal case @xcite , and for high friction regime @xmath26 we obtain @xmath34 which is the same as what was obtained in @xcite for @xmath35 . in general ( [ 5 ] ) is satisfied when @xmath36 where the dimensionless parameters are defined by @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 indicates the present time .",
    "the ( time ) average of a quantity over an oscillation whose period is @xmath20 is given by @xmath40    the adiabatic index of the scalar field , @xmath41 is defined by @xmath42 using ( [ 2 ] ) , we obtain @xcite @xmath43 the eos parameter of the scalar field field is then @xmath44 in the minimal case , @xmath33 , we recover the very well known relation @xcite @xmath45 the scalar field mimics the behavior of barotropic fluid with a constant eos parameter . for @xmath26 , we recover our previous result @xcite @xmath46 for a specific @xmath18 , eos parameter in high friction regime , @xmath26 , is smaller than that in @xmath33 limit ( see fig.([fig0 ] ) ) .",
    "by taking the time average of the continuity equation ( [ r1 ] ) over an oscillation , and bearing in mind that @xmath47 changes very slowly in one period , we obtain @xmath48 this can be regraded as the continuity equation for the effective energy density @xmath49 in time scales larger than the period of oscillation , where the replacement of parameters by their average values is acceptable @xcite .",
    "are different from their average values .",
    "] by definition we have @xmath50 where the last equality is valid for @xmath51 .",
    "finally the continuity equation becomes @xmath52 hence the scalar field behaves as a perfect fluid with known equation of state parameter in terms of the hubble parameter .",
    "henceforth we assume that the universe is nearly filled with a rapid oscillating scalar field dark energy and matter which is composed of baryonic , @xmath53 , and also cold dark matter @xmath54 @xmath55 the friedman equation is then @xmath56 in the absence of interaction between the dark energy and other sectors we can write @xmath57 the hubble parameter is a decreasing function of time and its infimum is @xmath58 .",
    "therefore we expect that @xmath47 asymptotes to @xmath58 or a constant at late time @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is a nonnegative constant .",
    "one can show that @xmath61 : indeed putting @xmath62 in ( [ rr10 ] ) reveals that both @xmath63 and @xmath64 tends to @xmath58 at late time .",
    "but from friedman equation this leads to @xmath65 .",
    "obtaining an analytical solution for ( [ rr10 ] ) is not feasible .",
    "but one can examine the ability of the model to describe the deceleration to acceleration phase transition and its converse ( which is salient feature of this model ) , by presenting a series solution near the possible transition time .",
    "when the sign of @xmath66 changes from negative to positive , the decelerated expansion of the universe becomes accelerated . by assuming that the hubble parameter is an analytic function of time , in the neighborhood of the transition time , which for simplicity we take as @xmath67 , the hubble parameter has the taylor expansion @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath69 is the order of the first nonzero derivative of @xmath47 with respect to @xmath70 at transition time .",
    "@xmath71 at @xmath67 , leads us to take @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "hence near the transition time we have @xmath74 in this way @xmath75 .",
    "for @xmath76 the transition occurs from deceleration to acceleration phase at @xmath67 .",
    "the opposite transition occurs for @xmath77 . to see whether our model admits such a solution , we examine ( [ rr12 ] ) in the continuity and friedman equations . with the hubble parameter taken as ( [ rr12 ] )",
    ", the series solution of the @xmath64 is given by @xmath78 in the same way @xmath79 by inserting ( [ rr12 ] ) , ( [ rr13 ] ) , and ( [ rr14 ] ) in the friedman equation and equating the coefficients of each power of @xmath70 , we deduce that this equation , up to @xmath80 , is satisfied provided that : @xmath81 @xmath82 and @xmath83 hold . using these equations we obtain @xmath84 in the minimal model @xmath85 , @xmath86 reduces to @xmath87 .",
    "so _ in this case there may be only one transition_. in the nonminimal case , the situation changes and @xmath86 is equivalent to @xmath88 therefore , in principle , we may have both deceleration to acceleration and acceleration to deceleration phase transitions .",
    "the ratio of energy densities at transition time is given by @xmath89 for @xmath90 , @xmath91 while for @xmath92 we have @xmath93 .",
    "we can generalized the model by allowing energy exchange between dark components . in the presence of an interaction @xmath94 ,",
    "the continuity equations read @xmath95 inspired by the models proposed for reheating in which the inflation decays during coherent rapid oscillation @xcite , we choose the source term as @xmath96 , but here instead of radiation ( ultra relativistic particles ) the scalar field is assumed to decay to dark matter .",
    "so the equation of motion of the scalar field becomes @xmath97 which in the minimal case reduces to the well known equation for inflaton decay @xcite @xmath98 with the same method used to compute @xmath41 in ( [ 14 ] ) , we arrive at @xmath99 an interesting property of this interaction is that it depends on @xmath47 such that it is inoperative for @xmath100 .",
    "but , as @xmath101 , @xmath47 decreases during universe expansion and the decay becomes more relevant .",
    "this may alleviate the coincidence problem , i.e. why the matter and dark energy densities are at the same order today .",
    "this energy exchange , postpones the beginning of the acceleration phase of the universe and also expedites the possible dark matter domination at late time .",
    "let us now study the late time attractor solutions of the model and investigate the fate of the universe .    by defining dimensionless parameters @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and also dimensionless fractional energy densities @xmath106 , @xmath107 , the continuity equations and the friedman equation",
    "after some computations reduce to a system of autonomous differential equations @xmath108 prime denotes derivative with respect to the time @xmath109 .",
    "note that as the eos parameter of the scalar field and the interaction term are @xmath47 dependent , we can not simply eliminate @xmath47 in our equations by redefinition of time parameter , hence the evolution of the hubble parameter is included in the three dimensional autonomous system .    by setting @xmath110",
    "we can find the fixed points @xmath111 .",
    "the only fixed point consistent with @xmath112 is @xmath113 . to study the stability of this fixed point we consider small homogenous variations about the fixed point : @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 . inserting these into ( [ w1 ] ) we obtain @xmath117 where @xmath118 .",
    "the jordan form of @xmath119 is given by @xmath120 , therefore as @xmath18 by definition , the critical point is unstable only for @xmath121 .",
    "so in our model there is a late time stable attractor associated to cold matter dominated epoch . in this framework ,",
    "the present acceleration of the universe must be considered as a transient era .",
    "cosmological perturbations in the inflationary era in a model where the rapid oscillating scalar field is considered as the inflaton ( the only ingredient of the early universe ) , is discussed in details in @xcite .",
    "here we are only concerned about the late time acceleration where other ingredients are also present .",
    "requiring stability against perturbations puts some constraints on the parameters . in this part based on @xcite",
    "we study briefly this subject for some special cases .",
    "consider the perturbed frw space time @xmath122 @xmath123 is the conformal time and @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 are scalar functions .",
    "the @xmath128 fluid four vector velocity is @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the peculiar velocity potential .",
    "evolution of the density perturbation of the @xmath128 component , @xmath131 , and velocity perturbation @xmath132 are given by @xcite @xmath133 @xmath134    prime denotes derivative with respect to the conformal time and @xmath135 .",

    "@xmath137 is related to anisotropic stress tensor @xmath138 .",
    "@xmath139 is the sound speed in the rest frame of @xmath128 fluid .",
    "@xmath140 is the momentum transfer potential .",
    "each fluid has its own evolution equation @xmath141 . for a system of interacting dark energy @xmath142 and dark matter @xmath64 , @xmath143 .",
    "@xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the total four velocity potential .    for @xmath146 ,",
    "the equation ( [ rr3 ] ) exhibits an instability . for the interaction @xmath147",
    ", we have @xmath148 . in large scale @xmath124 and @xmath149 terms may be dropped and for @xmath150 the interaction term may be neglected and there is no instability @xcite . for @xmath33 , solving ( [ rr3 ] ) , one obtains @xcite @xmath151 @xmath152 , when the transfer of the energy momentum is parallel to dark matter ( dark energy ) and @xmath153 is the time at which @xmath154 .",
    "@xmath155 leads to an instability which has significant fingerprints in the present era provided that the growth rate of velocity perturbation satisfies @xmath156 .",
    "note that the above discussions are true in the domain of validity of @xmath26 and @xmath33 .",
    "other interactions may also be taken for this theory , such as @xmath157 which was considered in @xcite .",
    "the large scale non adiabatic instability in this case may be cured by allowing dark energy eos parameter to vary @xcite . in our model , this variation is not an ad hoc assumption but a characteristic of our solution .",
    "the continuity equations of energy densities , in terms of the redshift parameter @xmath158 defined by @xmath159 , are @xmath160 @xmath41 is given by eq.([14 ] ) .",
    "the energy exchange is considered only between dark sectors .",
    "the hubble parameter is given by @xmath161 .",

    "we neglect the contribution of the radiation .    in fig.([fig1 ] ) , dark energy and cold dark matter densities are depicted in terms of the redshift parameter for @xmath172 , in the absence of interaction .",
    "the values of fractional energy densities and the nearly constant eos parameter of dark energy at the present time are picked from planck 2013 data @xcite . in this case",
    "the potential is @xmath173 @xcite . for @xmath174",
    "the matter was dominated but as the eos parameter of the scalar field is negative , dark energy becomes dominant later .",
    "the eos parameter of @xmath2 is approximately a constant : @xmath175 , therefore as it can be seen in fig.([fig1 ] ) , in the absence of interaction @xmath63 changes very slowly .    in the intermediate regime where @xmath26 does not hold",
    ", @xmath2 has a dynamical eos parameter . in this case the behaviors of @xmath176 and @xmath177 , are plotted in fig.([fig2 ] ) , for @xmath178 and a quadratic potential .    in this example",
    ", the eos parameter shows a good agreement with the chevallier - polarski - linder parametrization @xcite , @xmath179 the eos parameter given by the approximation ( [ cpl ] ) and also what was obtained from our numerical solutions are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] )    in the presence of the interaction ( [ 26 ] ) , we plot the solutions of the system in figs.([fig4 ] ) and ( [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "we have still used the same initial conditions at @xmath167 as before . by comparing these figures with the previous ones",
    ", we find that in the presence of @xmath180 , the dark energy domination occurs at higher redshift @xmath158 .",
    "this is related to the fact that in the presence of the energy exchange , the dark matter decreases with a smaller slope while the dark energy decreases with a greater slope .",
    "a feature of our model , which is shown clearly in the figures ( [ fig4 ] ) and ( [ fig5 ] ) , is that the matter may become dominant in the future and the accelerated expansion ceases .",
    "we expect that the dark matter is diluted faster than dark energy which has a more negative eos parameter , so at first glance , it seems that the cease of acceleration or the dominance of dark matter at late time is related to the positive decay rate of @xmath2 to dark matter , but this is not the whole story : @xmath47 is a decreasing function of time , and the eos parameter of @xmath2 , evolves from @xmath181 at early time where @xmath182 , to @xmath183 corresponding to @xmath33 at late time .",
    "so the eos of @xmath2 increases and this component may even behave as dark matter at late time ( for n=2 ) . in the era",
    "where the universe is nearly filled with dark energy , pressureless dark matter and baryonic matter , the universe eos is be given by @xmath184    @xmath185 specifies deceleration ( acceleration ) .",
    "this can also be expressed in terms of the deceleration parameter @xmath186 : for @xmath187 the expansion is accelerating ( decelerating ) . in fig.([fig7 ] ) the deceleration parameter is depicted in terms of the redshift .",
    "employed parameters are @xmath188    this figure shows that even for @xmath189 the acceleration ceases in the future and the presence of interaction term only expedites this procedure .    note that in the aforementioned examples , if one takes @xmath190 , where @xmath191 , the condition required for rapid oscillation , i.e. ( [ 9 ] ) , is satisfied . to obtain this",
    ", one can evaluate numerically the right hand side of ( [ 9 ] ) by taking @xmath192 @xcite .",
    "the non - minimal derivative coupling model proposed in @xcite , was employed to describe the recent acceleration of the universe . in this context , instead of the well known slow roll scalar field model",
    ", we considered a rapid oscillating scalar field with a power law potential .",
    "after some preliminaries and generalizing the results of @xcite to the quintessence case , we obtained required condition for such an oscillation and depending on the strength of the coupling we divided our study into two categories . in the high friction regime , we obtained a constant eos parameter for dark energy which was different from what was obtained in the minimal case permitting the acceleration for a wider range of potentials . in the intermediate regime , a dynamical eos parameter was derived allowing acceleration to deceleration phase transition in the future without invoking interaction terms .",
    "this transition was discussed by obtaining a series solution for the system .",
    "we also took into account a possible energy exchange between dark components ( inspired by inflaton decay during its coherent rapid oscillation ) , alleviating the coincidence problem . in the high friction regime , and the minimal model , where the eos parameter of dark energy is a constant the interaction term is responsible for the possible future acceleration to deceleration phase transition .",
    "we showed also that when the dark energy decays to dark matter , there exists a late time stable attractor for the system .",
    "a short discussion was given on the instabilities of interacting dark energy model in the perturbed frw universe .",
    "this discussion was restricted to high friction regime and the minimal model where the dark energy has a constant eos parameter .",
    "an outlook is to investigate this problem in intermediate regime where the dark energy has a variable eos parameter and also considering more general interactions terms proposed in the literature .",
