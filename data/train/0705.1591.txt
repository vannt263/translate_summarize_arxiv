    "collisions between nuclei at ultra - relativistic energies produce charged particles - either in the hadronic or in the partonic state , depending on the collision energy .",
    "interaction of these charged particles produce real and virtual photons ( lepton pairs ) .",
    "because of their nature of interaction , the mean free path of electromagnetic ( em ) radiation is large compared to the size of the system formed after the collision .",
    "therefore , em radiation can be used as an efficient tool to understand the initial conditions of the system  @xcite and hence can be used to probe the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation in heavy ion collisions ( hic ) .",
    "practically , however , this is a difficult task , because on the one hand the thermal radiation from qgp has to be disentangled from those produced in initial hard collisions and from the decays of hadrons and on the other hand the evaluation of thermal photon and dilepton spectra need various inputs _ such as _ initial temperature ( @xmath0 ) , thermalization time ( @xmath1 ) , equation of state ( eos ) , transition temperature ( @xmath2 ) , freeze - out temperature ( @xmath3 ) etc , which are not known unambiguously . the sensitivity of the photon spectra on these inputs are demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "therefore , theoretical results on transverse momentum ( @xmath4 ) spectra of photons and dileptons always suffer from these uncertainties .",
    "of course , certain constraints can be imposed on these inputs from experimental results - _",
    "e.g. _ transverse mass spectra of hadrons and hadronic multiplicities are useful quantities for constraining freeze - out conditions and initial entropy production .    in the present work , therefore , we evaluate the ratio of the transverse momentum spectra of thermal photons and lepton pairs : r_em = ( d^2n_/d^2p_tdy)_y=0/(d^2n_^/d^2p_tdy)_y=0 [ eq1 ] in which most of the uncertainties mentioned above are expected to get canceled so that it provides accurate information  @xcite about the state of the matter formed initially .",
    "we calculate the ratio , @xmath5 for sps , rhic and lhc energies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the invariant yield of thermal photons and lepton pairs . in section iii , the space time evolution is outlined .",
    "results are presented in section iv . finally in section",
    "v , we summarize the work .",
    "the rate of thermal dilepton production per unit space - time volume per unit four momentum volume is given by@xcite = l(m^2 ) f_be [ virtual ] @xmath7 is em coupling , @xmath8 is the imaginary part of the retarded photon self energy and @xmath9 is the bose - einstein factor which is a function of @xmath10 for a thermal system having four velocity @xmath11 at each space - time point of the system , @xmath12 is the invariant mass square of the lepton pair and l(m^2)=(1 + ) [ spinor ] arises from the final state leptonic current involving dirac spinors .",
    "@xmath13 in eq .",
    "[ spinor ] is the lepton mass .",
    "the real photon production rate can be obtained from the dilepton emission rate by replacing the product of the em vertex @xmath14 , the term involving final state leptonic current and the square of the ( virtual ) photon propagator by the polarization sum ( @xmath15 ) for the real photon .",
    "finally the phase space factor for the lepton - pairs should be replaced by that of the photon to obtain the photon emission rate , e = f_be [ real ] ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "the results given above is correct up to order @xmath16 in em interaction but exact , in principle , to all order in strong interaction .",
    "now it is clear form eqs .",
    "[ virtual ] and  [ real ] that for the evaluation of photon and dilepton production rates one needs to evaluate the imaginary part of the photon self energy .",
    "the cutkosky rules or thermal cutting rules give a systematic procedure to express the imaginary part of the photon self energy in terms of the physical amplitude .",
    "ideally , one wants to detect photons from qgp .",
    "however , the experimental measurements contain photons from various processes e.g , from the hard collisions of initial state partons of the colliding nuclei , thermal photons from quark matter and hadronic matter and photons from the hadronic decays after freeze - out .",
    "the contributions from the initial hard collisions of partons is under control via perturbative qcd ( pqcd )",

    "can be reconstructed , in principle , by invariant mass analysis .",
    "but the most challenging task is to separate the thermal photons originating from the hadronic phase , which needs careful theoretical estimation .",

    "the change in the hadronic spectral function will enhance the dileptons from the hadronic contribution in the lower mass ( @xmath93 ) window , however the overall structure in the ratio , @xmath5 will not change appreciably . at the transition temperature ( @xmath94 mev )",

    "the slope of the ratio at low @xmath4 also indicates substantial change with increasing @xmath49 , the slope is minimum at the @xmath55-peak .",

    "it is clear from the results displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ]  [ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] that the quantity , @xmath5 , reaches a plateau beyond @xmath97 gev for all the three cases _ i.e. _ for sps , rhic and lhc .",

    "as mentioned before for all the three cases , except @xmath0 all other quantities _ e.g. _ @xmath2 , @xmath96 and eos are same , so the difference in the value of @xmath5 in the plateau region originates due to different values of initial temperature , indicating this can be a measure of @xmath0 .",
    "the following analysis will be useful to understand the origin of the plateau at high @xmath4 region .",
    "the strong three momentum dependence in the dilepton and photon emission rates ( eqs .",
    "[ virtual ] and  [ real ] respectively ) originates from the thermal factor , @xmath98 . for a static system the energy , @xmath99 can be written as @xmath100 , where @xmath101 @xmath102 . at high @xmath103 , @xmath104 ,",

    "the range of @xmath49 under present study is @xmath107 .",
    "the energy , @xmath99 appearing in both the photon and dilepton emission rates should be replaced by @xmath10 for a system expanding with space - time dependent four velocity @xmath11 . under the assumption of cylindrical symmetry and longitudinal boost invariance @xmath11 can be written as u^=_r(t/,v_rcos , v_rsin , z/ ) where @xmath108 @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 is the radial velocity , @xmath112 . the four momentum , @xmath113 where @xmath114 . therefore , for dilepton u^p_=_r(m_tcosh(y-)-v_rp_tcos ) [ flowe ] for photon the factor @xmath10 can be obtained by replacing @xmath115 in eq .",
    "[ flowe ] by @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath4 dependence of the photon and dilepton spectra originating from an expanding system is predominantly determined by the thermal factor @xmath9 .",

    "( ii)if the large @xmath49 pairs originate from early time ( when the flow is small ) the ratio , @xmath5 which includes space - time dynamics will be close to the static case and hence will show plateau .",
    "( iii ) however , at late time when the radial flow is large and @xmath49 is comparable to or larger than @xmath4 the effect of flow on dilepton will be larger ( receives larger radial kick due to non - zero @xmath49 ) than the photon and hence the plateau may disappear .",
    "therefore , the disappearance of plateau structure in @xmath5 in moderate or high @xmath49 region will indicate the presence large radial flow .",
    "this can be understood from the results shown in figs  [ fig5 ] and  [ fig6 ] .    in fig .",

    "therefore , the @xmath4 spectra may change due to broadening when the integration over @xmath49 is done in a limited @xmath49 domain .",
    "we have checked that doubling the @xmath55 width ( @xmath143 mev ) changes @xmath5 by @xmath144 .",
    "it is important to note that the change in mass and widths can not be arbitrary it should obey certain constraints as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "therefore , simultaneous measurements of @xmath4 spectra and invariant mass distribution of real and virtual photons could be very useful to understand the nature of medium effects on hadrons  @xcite .",
