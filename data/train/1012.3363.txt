    "the tensor force , which is necessary to explain the properties of the deuteron , attracts special attention recently , because it has turned out to play an essential role in the existence limit of exotic nuclei , as well as the nuclear shell structure far from the @xmath0-stability line ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "an important feature is that the spatial average of the tensor force is exactly equal to zero , so that its effect is spatially localized . on the other hand",
    ", the spin - orbit force , which is necessary to explain the large spin polarizations of scattered nucleons , plays a crucial role in the nuclear shell structure .",
    "the origin of the tensor force can be found in the one - pion exchange potential , and that of the spin - orbit force in the relativistic aspects of quantum dynamics .",
    "thus the tensor and spin - orbit forces are quite different in their origins , while resulting in the same dynamical effect , namely , spin polarization .",
    "spin polarization , which arises mostly from the spin - orbit force , spontaneously takes place in the early stage of heavy - ion reactions , and affects the equilibration process to a large extent .",
    "as long as the microscopic time - dependent skyrme energy density functional ( skyrme - edf ) calculations are concerned , the appearance of spontaneous spin polarization even in central collisions between @xmath0-stable nuclei was shown , and its origin was clarified to be the time - odd part of the spin - orbit force @xcite . therefore , the enhancement or reduction of spin polarization gives an ideal framework to pin down the properties of the tensor force in collision situations .    in this paper ,",
    "the role of the tensor force in heavy - ion reactions is investigated based on time - dependent density functional calculations with explicitly implemented tensor force , where the time - odd part of the spin - orbit force is also fully taken into account .",
    "special attention is paid to the effect of the tensor force on time evolution . as a result",
    ", some information on the importance of the contribution from the tensor force in heavy - ion reactions is presented .",
    "the contribution of the tensor force , whose role was underestimated and mostly neglected for a long time , was substantially studied in the context of skyrme - edf only recently @xcite . here",
    "we begin with the functional form of the tensor and spin - orbit forces in skyrme - edf .",
    "let @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 represent the number density , spin density , and spin - orbit density , respectively .",
    "the contribution of the tensor and spin - orbit forces to the energy density functional has the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 stand for neutron and proton , respectively ) .",
    "@xmath8 , which is called the form factor of the spin mean field , is decomposed into the contributions from spin - orbit and tensor forces .",
    "@xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the form factors of spin - orbit and tensor mean fields , respectively .",
    "the contribution of the spin - orbit force to the functional @xcite is represented by @xmath12 note that the second term on the right - hand side , whose contribution in collision situations was discussed in @xcite , has never been taken into account for some modern skyrme parameterizations such as sly4d and skm * , because it makes fitting spin - orbit splittings more difficult .",
    "although there are several versions of the tensor force , we are concerned with the natural tensor force only .",
    "its contribution to the energy functional is represented by @xmath13 with @xmath14 satisfying @xmath15 , according to stancu - brink - flocard @xcite , where the unique contribution of the tensor force can be found in @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "the full introduction of the tensor force requires to refit additionally the corresponding central - force parameters .",
    "although the full introduction brings about largely different and complicated contributions depending on the choice of force parameter sets @xcite , it has been shown to mostly result in weakening the natural contribution @xcite .",
    "several versions of the tensor force are compared in @xcite . here",
    "we restrict discussion to the tensor force as defined by eq .",
    "( [ wt ] ) , because the aim is not a discussion of the existence limit of exotic nuclei , but rather the general features of the tensor contribution in reactions .",
    "it is readily seen that the effect of the tensor force corresponds to a quantitative modification of that due to the spin - orbit force .",
    "accordingly , the contribution of the tensor force should be discussed in association with the spin - orbit force .",
    "a framework for measuring the effects of the tensor force is presented with a focus on collision dynamics . concerning the spin polarization , it is reasonable to begin with a discussion of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "it is defined by the scalar triple product @xmath18 where @xmath2 and @xmath19 denote the spins of the two nucleons . in collision situations @xmath20 is related to the impact parameter .",

    ", we introduce a proper theoretical setting of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "our starting point is that the tensor and the spin - orbit forces are localized effects , which are not easy to compare in collision dynamics , if there is some similarity in their localized patterns .",

    "setting , the role of the tensor force in the spin polarization can be evaluated by the corresponding @xmath29-component of @xmath30 .",
    "accordingly , the tensor and spin - orbit forces can be compared , if there is a certain similarity between the @xmath29-components of @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( otherwise attraction or repulsion happen irregularly from place to place ) .",
    "note that their similarity , which will be shown to be true , is not trivial . in the following the @xmath29-components of @xmath33 and @xmath32",
    "are simply represented by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , if there is no ambiguity .",
    "a systematic three - dimensional time - dependent density functional calculation is carried out in a spatial box @xmath34 @xmath35 with a spatial grid spacing of 0.8 fm , in which the skyrme - force parameter set sv - tls @xcite is used for the tensor part , and skm * and sly4d @xcite for the remainder including the spin - orbit force : @xmath36 [ mev @xmath37 and @xmath38 [ mev @xmath37 .",
    "the parameter set sv - tls was lately introduced in the context of the refitted tensor force ; it is one of the most reliable parameter sets in terms of reproducing the contribution of the form factor @xmath11 of the tensor mean field .",
    "the relative velocity in the collisions is set to 10 % of the speed of light , and the initial distance of the colliding nuclei to 20.0 fm ; their initial positions are ( 0,0,10 ) and ( 0,0,-10 ) . in order to pay special attention to the mass - dependent general features",
    ", we consider central collisions between identical @xmath39=@xmath40 nuclei : @xmath41o + @xmath41o , @xmath42ca + @xmath42ca and @xmath43ni + @xmath43ni .",
    "the contributions from @xmath44 and @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ wt ] ) are not so different for collisions between @xmath39=@xmath40 nuclei , therefore the parameter dependence mostly arises from the sum of @xmath46 and @xmath0",

    "are also shown ( contour = 0.01 , 0.06 , 0.11 and 0.16 @xmath50 ) . ]",
    "figure  [ fig-1 ] shows the time evolution of @xmath42ca + @xmath42ca resulting in fusion , where the terms associated with the tensor force ( sv - tls ) are explicitly included . the same calculation without the spin - orbit force",
    "does not achieve fusion . omitting the tensor force",
    "while including the spin - orbit force shows no notable difference to the density evolution with all force terms included .",
    "this suggests that large dissipation arises from the spin - orbit force , while the tensor - force contribution is definitely small .",
    "the composite nucleus evolves with a continuing oscillation ; the two nuclei get into contact around time = 4.2 @xmath48 10@xmath49 s , and the first full - overlap is achieved at 5.6 @xmath48 10@xmath49 s.    let us consider the @xmath27-projection of spin for each single nucleon .",
    "the spin distribution of the colliding nuclei is calculated by their superposition : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote the densities of spin - up and spin - down components , respectively . in this definition ,",
    "the density plays the role of weight .",
    "the value of @xmath54 is positive if the spin - up component is more abundant , zero for saturated spins , and negative otherwise . as is seen from the presence of @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ form3 ] ) , the problem of comparing the different role of tensor and spin - orbit forces becomes meaningless if spontaneous spin polarization is absent .",
    "spin polarization appears for all the reactions and all the force parameter sets used ; e.g. , in fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] , the presence of spin polarization is shown for @xmath42ca + @xmath42ca . as a result ,",

    "figure  [ fig-2 ] shows that strong spin polarization is located on the edge of the density distribution .",
    "the localized pattern of the spin structure is complicated , leading to a complicated localization of attraction and repulsion due to the tensor force .",
    "the spin distribution is point - symmetric with respect to the origin , which reflects the symmetry of the central collision .",
    "note that the spatial average of spin polarization for the spin - saturated system is equal to zero .",
    "let us begin with the effect of the tensor force in a compound nucleus formed briefly after the full - overlap situation ( time = 6.0 @xmath48 10@xmath49 s ) .",
    "in case of @xmath42ca + @xmath42ca , fig .  [ fig-3 ] compares the @xmath29-components of @xmath8 for the tensor and spin - orbit forces .",
    "both distributions are antisymmetric with respect to the @xmath26-axis , and have similar distributions but different signs and amplitudes .",
    "it is clearly seen that the tensor - force contribution is opposite to the spin - orbit force contribution , and amounts to less than 10 percent of latter .",
    "it follows that the total contribution from tensor and spin - orbit force is not so different from the contribution of the spin - orbit force alone .",
    "no significant difference is noticed between the values for protons and neutrons .",
    "this is expected for a collision between @xmath47 nuclei .",
    "this difference in sign and the smallness of the tensor force contribution compared to the spin - orbit force contribution is found to hold regardless of the choice of force parameter set and the mass of the colliding nuclei .",
    "this difference in sign , however , did not appear for the @xmath27 and @xmath26-components .",

    "the contribution of the tensor force is quite small before the contact time ( 4.2 @xmath48 10@xmath49 s ) , increases after the contact time , achieves local - maximum at times 6.75 @xmath48 10@xmath49 s and 9.00 @xmath48 10@xmath49 s , and relaxes afterwards .",
    "several points should be remarked here .",
    "first , the tensor - force contribution is enhanced in collision situations , being up to 10 times larger than before the contact time .",
    "second , the opposite sign and the smallness of the tensor compared to the spin - orbit contributions are apparent during the heavy - ion collision but not before contact .",
    "the opposite sign means that the contribution of the tensor force continues to weaken the spin polarization during the reaction .",
    "third , the similarity between protons and neutrons is confirmed throughout the reaction .",

    "the major difference is that its amplitude is actually smaller than the spin - orbit force contribution , but reaches as much as 50% of the spin - orbit contribution in @xmath43ni + @xmath43ni .",
    "the difference between the two parameters can be related to the largeness of the @xmath46 and @xmath0 values proposed in the refs .",

    "based on time - dependent density functional calculations with explicitly implemented tensor force , the role of the tensor force has been studied in the context of collision dynamics .",

    "as long as heavy - ion reactions between @xmath70 identical nuclei are concerned , the opposite sign and the smallness of the tensor force contribution compared to that of the spin - orbit force has been confirmed independent of mass . in particular , the opposite sign means that the spin polarization , thus the large dissipation due to the spin - orbit force , is reduced by the tensor force .",
    "we conclude that the tensor - force contribution is rather important in heavy - ion reactions with respect to the magnitude of dissipation .",
