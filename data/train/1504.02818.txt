    "echoing weinberg , many researchers deem it premature to state that the foundational issues with quantum mechanics are resolved .",
    "the source of contention can be traced back to the different processes required in quantum mechanics : one is unitary evolution , the other a non - unitary reduction of the wave - function .",
    "many attempts exist to blur this distinction , decoherence being the most well - known physical mechanism entrusted with that responsibility .",
    "apart from the debatable criticisms having to do with how decoherence itself encodes the measurement process ( e.g. how the born rule emerges from decoherence in the many worlds interpretation ) , the approach has one objective shortcoming : it requires a separation between system and environment .",
    "in particular , it seems to be of limited use for quantum cosmology and quantum gravity .    in this paper",
    ", i would like to pursue an avenue of investigation which further blurs the distinction between unitary evolution and reduction of the wave - function .",
    "unlike previous attempts in which reduction processes are effectively included in the unitary evolution , here both types of processes emerge from a fundamentally timeless description of the entire universe .",
    "this avenue of inquiry is suggested by some of the prevailing difficulties in finding a consistent theory of quantum gravity ; difficulties not a priori related to the foundational quantum mechanics issues mentioned above , but whose resolution might be relevant for them .",
    "the simple resolution suggested here provides both a particular interpretation of quantum mechanics as well as different formulations of gravitational theories , more suited to this setting .",
    "the conceptual obstacles of quantum gravity which motivate this work are two - fold : * i * ) in standard approaches to quantum gravity , one is required to deal with the conceptually challenging notion of the _ superposition of causal structures _ , for which there is very little understanding .",
    "the main problem here is that superposition make sense for space - like separated components of the system , but this relation requires as input a value to the field which we would like to superpose ! *",
    "ii * ) in quantum mechanics , there is no operator corresponding to time ( not to be confused with the generator of unitary evolution ) . in many modern so - called relational approaches",
    "@xcite , two notions of time are distinguished : the evolution time , and the time as measured by relations to a subsystem called the clock , with respect to which one can ( under certain restrictions ) calculate the evolution of other subsystems . in gr ,",
    "there is but one notion of time coming with the theory : that of proper time .    the present attempt to untangle the first problem",
    "consists in basing gravitational theories , _ at the kinematical level _ , on fields",
    "for which there is no notion of causality ; causality should emerge dynamically . through this attempt ,",
    "we arrive at two notions of time , in parallel to the ones of quantum mechanics : one is related to global evolution , the other to a relational , experienced duration .",
    "while it may be difficult to glean relativity of simultaneity from global evolution - time , it seems quite possible that it can be recovered when duration - time is used .",
    "the consequences of this approach to the construction of gravitational models will be only touched on here , being fully pursued in an upcoming publication , as well as in @xcite . here",
    "i will focus on making sense of the implications of these approaches for interpretations of quantum mechanics .",

    "semi - classical attempts at sourcing the gravitational fields by expectation values of the matter degrees of freedom while keeping gravity itself classical , @xmath1 , have severe limitations ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for instance , what happens to the gravitational field upon a measurement of a matter source which is in a state of superposition with support on two space - like separated bumps ?",
    "e.g. schematically , let a source in position space be such that @xmath2 , and @xmath3 for any @xmath4 such that @xmath5 for @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a region which is space - like separated from region @xmath8 ( @xmath8 being the region with the analogous properties for @xmath9 ) . upon measurement , the average value of the quantum fields must be updated , and such a measurement collapse would require that the gravitational field respond instantaneously .",
    "of course , general relativity has no intrinsic concept of instantaneous , leaving us in precisely the same muddle we started off in .",
    "in axiomatic qft , one demands that operators with space - like separated support , @xmath10 commute , @xmath11=0 $ ] .",
    "space - like presumes a definite property for the very field we would like to be able to superpose .",
    "what is the meaning of this demand when the the operators are acting on states representing perturbations and superpositions of gravitational fields ?",
    "it is hard to tell , and it seems to me there are very few ways forward in thinking about these problems .",
    ", which are also eigenfunctions of the time derivative ( i.e. along the killing vector ) , @xmath12 .",
    "one then uses this eigenfunction to construct associated raising and lowering operators , a fock space , etc . in the absence of a preferred time - like direction in space - time , raising and lowering operators become less meaningful ( see @xcite for a more complete treatment of this point ) . ]",
    "moreover , one might even ask if we _ can _ give meaning to the superposition of causal structures without violating conservation of probability .",
    "the latter requires a fixed notion of past and future which the former seems to deny . as alluded to ,",
    "one of the problems is that the non - unitary reduction process in quantum mechanics  the updating of the wave - function usually identified with a measurement  is done _ instantaneously _ , at e.g. schroedinger time @xmath13 .    to make such an instantaneous process more in line with quantum gravity",
    ", we could try to define a gravitational transition amplitude ( or transfer matrix ) for a finite time , schematically : [ transition_amplitude]w(h_1,h_2)=_h_1^h_2 g where @xmath14 is the gravitational density , and i have omitted the required gauge - fixings and fadeev - popov determinant . since the theory is non - renormalizable , this action should only be taken as an effective theory at a given scale . here",
    "@xmath15 are initial and final spatial geometries , i.e. for the hypersurfaces @xmath16 and the embedding @xmath17 then @xmath18 , where here @xmath19 is the abstract space - time metric tensor field . the issue is that refoliations shift @xmath15 ( in a @xmath19-dependent manner ) , and change . in other words , local time reparametrizations , or refoliations , do nt act as a group in configuration space .",
    "thus they do not allow one to form a  gauge - invariant quotient from its action and there is no way in which we can have such a transition amplitude act between gauge - invariant states .",
    "accordingly , one can only show that the gauge - fixed is independent of the bulk space - time gauge - fixings ( i.e. those that are the identity at @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) together with the gauge - fixings of the spatial diffeomorphisms at @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this was to be expected : shifting @xmath20 and @xmath21 with diffeomorphisms orthogonal to the hypersurfaces will completely alter the transition amplitude .",

    "classical gr admits a hamiltonian formulation , but it is a constrained theory . the configuration variable is taken to be the spatial riemannian metric @xmath22 on the manifold @xmath23 , alluded to in .",
    "the space of all such metrics is called riem@xmath24 .",

    "d^3 x(n(x)h(x)+n^i(x)h_i(x ) ) the standard canonical quantization rules would suggest that the states of the system be given by wave functions of the configuration variable , @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the time variable occurring in the hamiltonian formulation . replacing as usual @xmath22 by its action through multiplication , and of its conjugate momentum with functional derivation , @xmath27",
    ", we could have the evolution of @xmath28 given by the schroedinger equation , [ schroedinger ] i= since @xmath29 is pure constraint , @xmath30 , but also @xmath31 .",
    "the changes generated in phase space by the flow of @xmath32 correspond simply to the action of spatial diffeomorphisms on @xmath22 and its conjugate momenta .",
    "its quantization would simply mean that the value of @xmath33 should be unchanged upon the action of an infinitesimal diffeomorphism of @xmath23 , @xmath34 , which acts pointwise on @xmath35 ( through pull - backs ) .",
    "the space of metrics quotiented by this gauge symmetry , riem / diff , is the space of geometries , also called _ superspace _ , and the action of @xmath36 as a quantum constraint operator implies the wavefunction lives over this superspace .",
    "the action of @xmath37 on the wave - functions gives rise to the wheeler - dewitt equation : [ wdw ] = 0 the analogous operator interpretation to @xmath38 here would be invariance wrt diffeomorphisms in space - time which move points orthogonally to @xmath23 . although that interpretation is not as clear in this case , it is still compatible to one effect of the implementation of the constraint , namely @xmath39 .    in my opinion , besides the more technical problems with the wheeler - dewitt equation , coming from quantization of the term quadratic in momenta @xcite ) or factor - ordering .",
    "] there are also conceptual knots one needs to untangle .",
    "we could imagine @xmath40 gives the amplitude of measuring @xmath41 at the time @xmath26 , but the wdw equation makes this interpretation untenable .",
    "that is because @xmath42 is forced to be independent of @xmath26 , even _",
    "right after a measurement_. in other words , there are no instantaneous observables in the wdw representation for pure gravity .",
    "this restricts the allowed observables in the theory to be those that commute with @xmath43 , and no information ensconced within any individual @xmath41 has this property .",
    "moreover , the requirement that the hamiltonian commute with all observables can be extremely restrictive . for ergodic systems , it will lead to the conclusion that the only observables ( continuous in phase space , with the liouville - induced topology ) are polynomials of the hamiltonian itself @xcite ; a defect which is at least camouflaged in minisuperspace approximations due to their simplicity .",
    "it is hard to salvage more intuitive meanings from the wdw equation on superspace , even in the semi - classical approximation , as can be seen clearly when there are multiple solutions of the equations of motion crossing at configurations @xmath44 .",
    "this situation is not exceptional ; most of our quantum optics experiments , double slits , or any macroscopic interference experiment require only knowledge of the multiple extremal ( classical ) dynamical paths of the system , connecting one initial and one final configuration .",
    "e.g. @xmath45\\rightarrow q$ ] ( with @xmath46 configuration space ) such that @xmath47 and @xmath48 for all @xmath49 , @xmath50 parametrizations of the curves , and such that @xmath51 , and such that for a given action @xmath52 , the given paths are extremal , @xmath53 .",
    "as i mentioned , such multiplicity of extremal paths is ubiquitous , and responsible for most of the interference and superposition experiments we observe in the laboratory .",
    "one such path , @xmath54 , could represent an electron that starts off in the electron gun , @xmath55 , passes through the upper slit ( the slit itself can be modeled by a wall potential with two gaps ) and ends up at the point @xmath56 on the screen ( @xmath57 ) at time @xmath58 .",
    "another , would be a similar such path , but going through the lower slit .",
    "the full effects of interference can be seen in these examples in a wkb approximation in configuration space .",
    "the wdw equation should also be able to represent this interference in configuration space .",
    "the first problem we encounter is that , for adm , extremal paths in superspace are not isolated .",
    "only what dewitt calls a sheaf of geodesics would be selected by an extremum principle , and one can not apply the usual semi - classical wkb approximation since there are still degenerate directions in the functional hessian . further , even supposing we have translated each individual extremal path in the space of geometries into a space - time , if two such extremal paths cross and interfere in given choices of foliations of these spacetimes , we can change the foliations so that the two paths no longer cross in superspace , and thus interference should disappear .",
    "in other words , crossing bears no intrinsic meaning for wdw ; it is only the totality of sheafs of extremal paths that carry semi - classical significance .",
    "this thought - experiment reinforces the idea that  at least for pure gravity ",
    "it is only the entire wave - function on configuration space ( or superspace ) that makes complete sense in wdw .",
    "the type of models i have in mind here have different local symmetries  local symmetries which are untangled from evolution .",
    "this allows an ( ultra)local interpretation in configuration space , making such models more intuitive and in many senses more tractable within the context of reduced configuration space . in section [ sec : axioms ] i will mention the related difficulties in the quantum treatment ( e.g. brst , bfv ) of the gauge - symmetries of adm , and the relative advantages of gauge - symmetries that respect the principles i advocate for here ( namely , with a point - wise action in field space ) .",
    "it all hinges on relegating the status of causal relations to being of dynamical origin , and not kinematical .",

    "whereas in gr causality is inherited from the space - time metric  space - like is a statement about causal independence which depends on the metric  i would like to place local causally independent observables at the foundations of quantum gravity ( qg ) .",
    "space - time physics are to be recovered only effectively .",
    "as we will see , this setup is perfectly suited for relational approaches to quantum mechanics @xcite , whose results we are able to recycle .",
    "importantly , foregoing the space - time picture off - shell ( or before dynamics ) _ does not imply _ that a preferred simultaneity surface is classically _ detectable _",
    "( see @xcite for a explicit example ) .",
    "in fact , models of gravity can be formulated where we get _ all the advantages of a preferred notion of simultaneity _  compatibility with qm collapse and superpositions  and _ none of the drawbacks _  no detectable ether for classical ( relativistic ) mechanics . the fact that such theories need not imply a preferred choice of simultaneity goes contrary to common wisdom .",
    "the misguided intuition comes from imagining such space - like surfaces as being embedded in space - time , in which case indeed , they do define a notion of simultaneity .",
    "however , without the prior existence of space - time , one first requires a recipe to recover duration , using the dynamics of clocks and rods and fields throughout evolution in field - space .",
    "for instance , for a theory whose field space is that of spatial metrics , riem , for a given action @xmath59 , one would only obtain a solution curve of 3-metrics @xmath60 , such that @xmath61 .",
    "however , to find out what a space - time corresponding to this curve is , one needs to fill in the curve with a notion of duration ( or a lapse ) , e.g. : [ space - time]ds^2=-n _ [ ; x)^2dtdt + _ ab(x , t)dx^adx^b+_a[;x ) ( dtdx^a+dx^adt)where i used the mixed functional notation of dewitt ( square brackets signify functional dependence , and round brackets ultralocal dependence ) . in both the shift @xmath62 and the lapse @xmath63 are effective .",
    "the important point is that they only depend on @xmath13 through the curve @xmath60 , and are not inherited from space - time , quite the opposite : they build space - time .",
    "in fact , an interpretation , put forward in @xcite is that @xmath64 arises from the dynamics perceived by an abstract choice of observer ( and should thus be seen as functionals of the curve of metrics ) .",
    "this interpretation implies @xmath62 behaves like a superspace gauge - connection 1-form , providing the abstract observer with a notion of equilocality along time , and ensuring complete gauge - invariance wrt time - dependent spatial diffeomorphisms .",
    "this is all a consequence of the pointwise action of the gauge symmetry groups on configuration space , and the ensuing principal fiber bundle structure , a point we will expand on in section [ sec : axioms ] . for the lapse we require further specification .    in this framework , it is only after local time emerges from dynamics that one should begin discussing preferred notions of simultaneity . for illustration of this possibility , in appendix [ app : duration ] i give a simple example in which a possible notion of duration allows no such preference .",
    "the example relates a global action  with a global time and no refoliation invariance  with the bsw form of general relativity @xcite , which has a disguised version of refoliation invariance .    at the semi - classical level",
    ", the example makes sense of the distinction present in the relational dynamics formalism for quantum mechanics : there is one global time generating evolution through @xmath65 , and another local experienced time abstracted through the change of observables , usually identified with the hamiltonian of some subsystem serving as a clock , @xmath66 .",
    ", for a hilbert space @xmath67 usually assumed so that commutators vanish , @xmath68=0=[\\hat{h}_{\\mbox{\\tiny{rest}}},\\hat{h}_{\\mbox{\\tiny{sys}}}]=[\\hat{h}_{\\mbox{\\tiny{clock}}},\\hat{h}_{\\mbox{\\tiny{rest}}}]$ ] .",
    "it may be that in gravity there is no such separation , and yet we should be able to tell time by the gauge - invariant change of degrees of freedom . ]",

    "i include a sketch of a proof that the principles might single out the born rule as a measure in configuration space .",
    "i then address one problem of usual interpretations of consistent histories for path integrals in configuration space , laid out by halliwell @xcite , in section [ sec : decoherence ] , and suggest an alternative that avoids it .",
    "finally , i discuss another problem that is not fully addressed in relational quantum mechanical approaches within the context of path integrals : a replacement for the role of the epistemological updating of probabilities in the timeless context , through the notion of record - holding submanifolds , in section [ sec : records ] .",

    "let me first illustrate the issue of hypothesis - testing in science , and the meaning of the p - value , with the following standard example : imagine you have a coin , which you would like to test against your hypothesis , namely , that the coin is fair .",
    "this is your null hypothesis , it could be a prediction of your theory .",
    "you flip it 1000 times and get more heads than tails .",
    "the p - value wo nt tell you whether the coin is fair , but it will tell you the probability that you d get at least as many heads as you did _ if the coin was fair_. for instance , if you got 505 heads , there would be a pretty high chance that the coin was fair , so that it becomes harder to falsify the prediction of your theory ( your null hypothesis ) with this information . in other words , this would increase your confidence in your hypothesis .",
    "not so if you got 900 heads .",
    "in that case the probability that your null hypothesis holds is much smaller ( but never , ever , absolute zero ) .",
    "now , think of all the configurations in @xmath70 that have the physical record of a thousand coin tosses .",
    "given our volume form @xmath107 , we could partition such configurations into e.g. number of heads",
    ". then we look at our configuration and find out what are the chances that our partition is correct .",
    "nothing can tell you the fact of the matter of the coin .",
    "again , all you can know is the probability that you d get at least as many heads as you did , given that your hypothesis is correct \"  which is the meaning of the p - value",
    ". the more records of a given ( approximately ) reproducible phenomenon a set of configurations have , the more we test such null hypotheses .",
    "in this example , increasing the amount of coin tosses , the volume form @xmath107 would sharpen around the predicted value of the theory , and any result outside of it  say , all heads in the example above  would cause you to update your confidence on your distribution .",
    "of course it would still be possible that your state is just on a fringe configuration , and your hypothesis is still correct .",
    "but this becomes more and more unlikely , forcing you to update your credence on your hypothesis .",

    "then bayesian analysis gives a straightforward way to update your trust on the theory that gave you your theoretical distribution .",

    "then , equation justifies the practical use of the record configuration @xmath274 as the effective initial point in the kernel .",

    "it is clear that e.g. for actions that are of geodesic type in configuration space , this should hold at the semi - classical ( wkb ) level .",
    "this follows from the general argument from hamilton - jacobi theory of differential operators , as i now briefly comment on .",
    "suppose then that we were able to find a metric in configuration space for which extremal trajectories are given by geodesics ( see appendix [ app : jacobi_metric ] ) .",
    "from the jacobi procedure , this does not imply that there is no potential for the dynamical system , just that it can be reabsorbed into an effective metric in configuration space , with the use of specific conformal factors .",
    "this is _ not _ the case with adm gravity @xcite , and thus the arguments here do not extend to an interpretation of the wheeler - dewitt equation .    for any action which is just given by length , @xmath344=\\int dt \\left ( \\alpha g^{ab}\\dot \\gamma_a\\dot\\gamma_b\\right)^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath345 is the conformal jacobi factor .",
    "reparametrization invariance implies a reparametrization constraint , since @xmath346 implies @xmath347 in the quantum mechanical setting , this hamiltonian equation would translate into a timeless schroedinger equation .",
    "now , with the standard wkb ( or semi - classical ) approximation , one identifies the wave - function with something of the form @xmath348 , with @xmath349 is rapidly varying ( in units of @xmath193 ) compared to @xmath164 . in the classical limit , as in ordinary particle mechanics , the wave equation for @xmath28 approximates the hamilton - jacobi equation for the functional @xmath349 , and associated to any solution of the hamilton - jacobi equation is a family of classical trajectories on configuration space  the geodesics of the above system",
    ".    these trajectories are parallel to the current vector @xmath350 . in the wkb approximation , this current is conserved due to the global hamiltonian constraint above , since @xmath351 .",
    "moreover , we have a natural probability density associated to each classical trajectory ( in this wkb limit ) , which is proportional to @xmath352 and conserved along the classical trajectories ( again , this is not the case for the wdw equation , since the kinetic term has a negative contribution coming from the trace terms of the momenta ) .",
    "thus for any screen as defined by , by the definition of semi - classical records [ def : full_record ] , if extremal trajectories go through a small volume @xmath353 , the total semi - classical probability of any screen can not exceed that around @xmath354 ( or of a previous record - screen ) .",
    "in other words : @xmath355 in particular , since @xmath356 this means that [ conserv_prob]__(r ) |w(_r , ) |^21 and moreover , if the screen is complete , in the sense that every extremal path that crosses @xmath274 also intersects the screen , then the inequality of is saturated up to orders of @xmath216 . in other words , when taken with respect to a record , the total sum of the transition probability approaches unity .",
    "i started the paper discussing fault lines between the foundations of quantum mechanics and those of gravity .",

    "moreover , this action is not invariant under configuration - space - dependent diffeomorphisms . to make it so",
    ", i would have to add a prescription for lifting it from superspace , @xmath364diff to @xmath70 .",
    "this can be done by exploring the principal fiber bundle structure of @xmath70 , and introducing a connection form @xcite . in this case",
    ", one can take advantage of the metric on @xmath70 to introduce a connection which is roughly a projection orthogonal to the orbits of diff(m ) .",
    "in other words , vectors tangent to the orbits are of the form @xmath365 for @xmath366 a vector field , and thus orthogonality wrt to the metric gives vectors @xmath367 such that @xmath368 .",
    "since the orbits of diff are killing directions of the metric given in , the inner product between the tangent to a geodesic and the orbit remains constant .",
    "the geodesic equations for horizontal lifts ( i.e. such that @xmath369 is initially zero ) are : @xmath370 and one can , in fact , find explicit analytic solutions to the equations of motion @xcite . although i will not need it , to illustrate the concreteness of the model , i present these solutions below . given @xmath371 and @xmath372 ,",
    "let @xmath373 , with @xmath374 and @xmath375 .",
    "then the geodesic starting out at @xmath376 in the direction of @xmath22 is given by : [ equ : geodesic_gravity]g_ab(t)=g^0_ac ( e^(a(t)+b(t)_t ) ) ^c_bwhere @xmath377 is the matrix given by @xmath378 , @xmath379    for quite general cases , the geodesic equation , the exponential maps , jacobi fields , curvature , etc , have been computed @xcite .",

    "alternatively , it can be characterized by it values at @xmath162 and @xmath185 , through the two - point tensor matrix @xmath380 . ]",
    "the determinant here requires regularization , but in principle we can calculate everything needed for a semi - classical path - integral within the classical geometry of @xmath70 , by using equation and together with and the expression for the derivatives of the riemann exponential map ( which give the jacobi matrix ) .",
    "the symmetry transformations act as a group ( not a groupoid ) , and the arising brst transformations are straightforward , allowing a simple treatment of gauge - symmetries ( see @xcite , for the emerging form of the gauge - fixed path integral ) .",
    "there are two relevant issues for the gravitational quantum mechanics model that can be seen at this primitive stage : i ) geodesics departing with different velocities from the same point do not cross again , and thus the potential for this model to represent interference patterns diminishes .",
    "nonetheless , one can impose certain artificial boundary conditions and obtain interference patterns directly from moreover , geodesics can be extended indefinitely , but it is not true that any two points can be connected by a minimizing geodesic ( thus the hopf - rinow theorem for finite - dimensional riemannian geometry fails in this infinite - dimensional context ) .",
    "this already means that certain configurations have negligible volume from the start , without even taking into account the van - vleck determinant or the relevant records .",
    "since there will be at most one extremal path between @xmath381 and @xmath19 , the semi - classical probability density is given simply by @xmath382/\\hbar})\\mathcal{d}g= \\delta ( g^0 , g ) \\mathcal{d}g\\ ] ] where @xmath19 lies in a classical path from @xmath381 with a horizontal initial condition , i.e. @xmath383 and @xmath164 is defined by the determinant of the geometrical jacobi matrix , in .",
    "it is clear from that we could not have chosen the completely degenerate metric as @xmath384 .",
    "the measure @xmath385 in this case comes directly from the liouville measure , by integrating out the quadratic momentum terms in the action ( in hamiltonian variables ) , e.g. by defining @xmath386=1 $ ] .    in this case , since the action is just given by arc - length in configuration space , and again , there are nt multiple extremal paths between @xmath381 and @xmath19 , the maximum radius of the extremal coarse grainings given in definition [ def : ecs ] is @xmath387 . since there is no interference , in exactly the same fashion as the mott bubble chamber , metrics along the same geodesic ( separated by more than @xmath193 in arc - length ) can serve as records for ones coming later along the geodesic .",
    "thus in principle we can fully determine the gravitational semi - classical theory , complete with records interference ( or lack thereof ) and so on .",
    "it is of course , an extremely simplified example . nonetheless , apart from the complexity , other models , such as shape dynamics @xcite",
    ", should be subject to the same fundamental treatment .",
    "however , as i mentioned in the introduction , it should be noted that even after having a good semi - classical quantum gravitational model of this sort , there is still the problem of an effective space - time reconstruction from a curve of geometries . in other words , although along a classical trajectory we can order records and obtain a global ( in space ) notion of time , this might not be relevant for what observers within these trajectories in riem perceive as duration .",
    "this touches on the common question in quantum mechanics , surrounding what constitutes a relational clock , and is discussed in appendix [ app : duration ] .",
    "as has been said before , the main problem with many worlds is that none of us wants to think that ",
    "i am a mere copy of myself \" . in @xcite",
    ", wallace writes  according to our best current physics , branches are real \" , and",
    "this is roughly the position i take in this paper as well . as i explained ,",
    "my interpretation is not exactly of branches  there is no instant in which branching takes place  but there is a sense in which the ontological existence of configuration space is my version of the many worlds scenario . to be more precise , nothing is splitting ,",
    "all the individual copies of the system already exist in timeless @xmath70 .",
    "there is no measurement process , only records embedded in configurations and a relative volume of said configurations .",
    "this volume can be taken to be given by a born norm , and there is thus only a uniqueness problem for obtaining the born rule , not a consistency issue , like in standard many - worlds .",
    "crucially , here the born rule is not associated to a measurement , and there is no definite - outcome problem .",
    "moreover , i feel this sort of approach might have an easier time making sense of quantum gravity , in particular , in making sense of the problem of superposition of causal structures . in the path",
    "integral formalism applied to this setting , the problem disappears , being replaced by a completely understandable phenomenon of interference in configuration space  an interference reflected in the static volume form over configuration space    for instance , in a framework for a classical gravitational action which can be posed in the space of geometries ( e.g. for a preferred gauge - fixing of the foliations of space - time ) , one can actually compute the probability of interference between two alternative paths which take gravitational back - reaction into account ; for instance , for two paths which refocus trajectories of some object whose gravitational charge is not negligible . since one can not screen gravity , interference will be generically negligible , as soon as the gravitational interaction of the object is itself not negligible and interacts with the rest of the universe . in other words , decoherence ( in the consistent - histories - like sense of section [ sec : decoherence ] ) , is all but inevitable .",
    "a specific model of this gendanken experiment will be explored in a future publication .",
    "lastly , i would like to comment on the perceived impacts this view might have on foundational problems of quantum mechanics .      in the present formulation the problem faced by decoherence",
    "is no longer to account for the observable classical reality from the basis of a quantum theory : each configuration is , tautologically , classical .",
    "the lack of observed superpositions here _ precedes decoherence_. empirically , it is only through interference effects that we _ can _ observe superpositions of states in the first place .",
    "decoherence is still indeed the explanation for the absence of interference , but it is not necessary in order to abolish the existence of macroscopic ( or microscopic ) superpositions .",
    "now , does the present work offer evidence that in this context decoherence alone solves the measurement problem ?",
    "let us try to address this by using two representative counter - arguments against the usual claim in this direction .",
    "first , joos in @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ does decoherence solve the measurement problem ?",

    "the answer to the question of definite outcomes is unambiguous : it is the ontological existence of configuration space  with each point including the instantaneous brain state of any possible observer  that resolves it .    on the other hand ,",
    "given a ` system + environment ' decomposition , decoherence is supposed to choose a pointer basis for the system , the basis onto which the reduced density matrix diagonalizes . is our choice of configuration space aligned with this criterion ?      the usual criterion for selecting a pointer basis for a system is based on the interaction with the environment , and embodies the idea of robustness of correlations .",
    "the selection is thus a property of the interaction hamiltonian , which acts by determining what states lead to stable , perceivable records when the interaction of the system with the environment is taken into account .",
    "the fact that the pointer basis is in most cases the position basis is seen as an effect of the manner by which we write local interactions .    here ,",

    "apart from the formalities , a minimal pec , if it exists , can be seen as just that minimal set of segments of extremal paths such that its corresponding pec yields the approximate amplitude for the given process . in that way",
    ", i propose that the existence of a unique minimal pec yields the _ preferred coarse - graining _ for any given transition amplitude between an initial and a final configuration .",
    "uniqueness of the minimal pec should be related to a unique solution of the variational problem of the transition amplitude wrt the vertices of the minimal pec .",
    "for instance , if we focus on the space of piecewise geodesics with two segments , between @xmath430 and @xmath431 , one has a well - defined calculus of variations where the position of the intermediary vertex @xmath432 is the variation parameter , and it makes sense to say that a certain @xmath433 is extremal . a simple , and yet non - trivial example in 2d",

    "the variational principle yields the two piecewise straight segments @xmath440 and @xmath441 .",

    "however , this is the only case in which we use minimal pecs quantitavely in this paper .",
    "a more quantitative treatment of this approach using the expansion is possible but will not be explored here ..    using minimal pecs , i can expand the definition of the semi - classical record used in definition [ def : full_record ] ,    [ def : record_pec ] given an initial configuration @xmath223 , @xmath71 and @xmath277 the minimal @xmath414-extremal coarse graining ( see def .",

    ", we provide criteria for the sort of locality we are accustomed to , in the physical space @xmath69 .",
    "namely , suppose that the action admits a jacobi - length representation , and let @xmath110 be a region in @xmath69 , @xmath109 , defining an embedded submanifold @xmath444 ( with appropriate boundary conditions , in a specific way we spell out in @xcite ) .",

    "i.e. decoupling of @xmath110 from the rest of @xmath69  to occur on a given region of configuration space , @xmath325 , we must have that @xmath445 is _ a totally geodesic submanifold of @xmath322_. we show that with this condition the semi - classical path integral kernel ( in the arc - length gauge ) decouples ( here written for regions @xmath446 ) , i.e. the kernel over the union of the regions turns into a product over each individual region : [ equ : cluster]w^_k o_k(^i_|_k o_k , ^f_|_k o_k)_k w^o^k_(^i_o_k , ^f_o_k)giving us our version of clustering decomposition .",
    "i should also note that there is an inherent non - locality with the jacobi form of reparametrization invariant actions ( they possess a global square root ) .",
    "however , there is a preferred gauge in which they can become local : the arc - length gauge . in this gauge ,",
    "the action becomes an energy functional ( in riemannian geometry terminology ) , and it is possible to show that the fadeev popov determinant is field independent . in other words ,",
    "this particular gauge - fixing can trade time reparametrization invariance for locality .",
    "to map theory to phenomenology , we need a definition of abstract observer .",
    "recently , we introduced a field - space connection @xcite .",
    "we showed that it is necessary for field - dependent gauge - covariance _ in the presence of boundaries _ , and , most importantly , that it _ faithfully represents non - backreacting observers and subsystems , used for reconstructing space - time . _",
    "an underlying space - time is absent , and with it , proper time .",
    "but we can rebuild both with a notion of duration , based on the the change of observables . as of yet",
    ", this procedure is still not fully worked out .",
    "for instance , the action will not be invariant under this reparametrization , but is there still some sense in which the two different actions give two levels of descriptions of the same system ? in the quantum mechanical case ,",
    "there are good arguments showing an equivalence within a wide variety of physical systems , merely by changing the clock subsystem @xcite .",
    "we can define the duration experienced by an observer curve @xmath447 in the 1-parameter curve of metrics @xmath448 , as [ exp_time ] d(x)t[g , g ; x)=dt where the definition should not depend on the overall parametrization @xmath449 , which already restricts @xmath450 to be homogeneous in velocity .",
    "a natural choice would be to have @xmath451 as representing the local contribution to the overall arc - length .",
    "that is , writing a riemannian energy - functional lagrangian action : @xmath452 where the subscript h denotes horizontal projection of the velocities ( e.g. perpendicular  according to some covariant supermetric on configuration space  to the orbits of the diffeomorphisms ) and we wrote the action as the multiplication of a kinetic term @xmath450 and potential one @xmath453 and @xmath454 is the dewitt supermetric .",
    "if we now replace every occurrence of @xmath449 by @xmath455 , trying to implement the experienced duration , , with the choice [ proper_time ] dt(x)=d(x)(x ) we would get an action of the baierlein - sharp - wheller type @xcite : [ bsw]s_=dd^3 x where now the kinetic term is calculated locally with derivatives wrt @xmath455 .",
    "there is a possible problem here in the definition of , as one can not invert the experienced time for the proper time .",
    "the other problem is that we really obtain a different theory by implementing this notion of duration , as the original action is not locally reparametrization invariant .    nonetheless , as the bsw can be seen to be a particular form of the einstein - hilbert action  writing the 3 + 1 lagrangian in terms of metric velocities , one can use the equations of motion of the lapse to eliminate it from the action , obtaining the bsw lagrangian  the above illustrates at least the possibility of having something like refoliation invariance emerge from experienced duration ( see @xcite for a similar approach ) .",
    "the argument goes as follows : suppose one prepares a large number @xmath130 of copies of the same system , in the same state : @xmath456 .",
    "the total state is then a direct product of branch states ( i.e. states that should survive decoherence ) : [ state_prep]|=_n_1n_2n_n c_n_1c_n_2c_n_n|_n_1n_2n_nwhere @xmath457 is the state in which system @xmath458 is in state @xmath459 , and we take the set of these states to be orthonormal .",
    "if @xmath28 is a product of branch states that survive decoherence , then the effect of the environment will be to merely multiply each @xmath460 with a phase factor , thus becomes : [ state_deco ] |= _ n_1n_2n_n c_n_1c_n_2c_n_n(i_1,n_1+i_n , n_n)|_n_1n_2n_nwhere the phases can be completely uncorrelated .",
    "this is supposed to mimic the preparation of a given experimental apparatus in multiple identical copies , much like we do in classical physics . in this case",
    ", one would assign the probability any one copy be in the state @xmath279 as @xmath461 , where @xmath462 is the number of indices equal to @xmath279 .      of course , we can not assume that applied to , @xmath463 will have eigenvalue @xmath465 ; it is only on average that we expect this to hold .",
    "in fact , when applied to , one obtains : [ hartle](f_n - c_n^2)| = the problem arises on how to interpret the norm in .",
    "there seems to be some circularity in assuming that the smallness of the born norm of the state implies that the born rule can be derived !",
