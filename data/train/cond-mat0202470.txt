    "the present calculation show that this situation persists even for large values of @xmath119 , although the bosonic frequency is slightly shifted . the fermionic strength is distributed over a few states around @xmath159 , showing that the induced fermi - fermi interaction via bosons is not strong enough to make a coherent superposition of the fermion particle - hole states .",
    "the total monopole strength for fermion is by an order of magnitude larger than that for boson , even though the number of fermions involved in the excitation is smaller because of the pauli principle , e.g. @xmath160 for fermion and @xmath161 for boson at @xmath162 .",
    "this is because of the broader density distribution for fermions .",
    "the strength distribution may suggest that the fermions and bosons are moving independently even for rather large values of @xmath119 .",
    "this is not necessarily the case , however , as one may see in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsf - m ] , where we plot the dynamical structure factor for the three cases , i.e. , the states at @xmath163 for @xmath164 , at @xmath165 for @xmath166 and at @xmath167 for @xmath168 - 3.0 , which carry the largest strengths for the in - phase monopole operator .",
    "although the fermionic strength is far larger than the bosonic one for this state , the mixture of the bosonic component is not small and is peaked at larger values of the momentum transfer @xmath90 as shown by the dashed lines .",
    "the latter shows that the bosons oscillate in the inner region although not quite recognizable as far as one studies only the @xmath169 distribution .    in refs .",
    "@xcite we suggested that an instablity towards collapse may occur at large negative values of @xmath119 and may be signaled by the lowering of @xmath149 .",
    "in the present calculation with smaller number of particles this is not apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : afce ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdim ] we show the strength distribution at @xmath170 .",
    "this value is close to the critical value of instability around @xmath171 estimated from the mlmer s condition  @xcite and around @xmath172 from the condition by roth and feldmeier  @xcite .",
    "we find a lowering of a single state which carries 13.9% of the ews .",
    "the average frequency for this case is @xmath173 appreciably lower than the value @xmath174 for @xmath175 . at more negative values of @xmath119",
    "we could not find a stable ground state .",
    "let us study the character of the low - lying excited states by considering the response to the probe @xmath176 parametrized by @xmath4 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the angle @xmath4 was determined by minimizing the average frequency @xmath149 for @xmath177 so as to find the character of the probe which favors the low - lying states .",
    "once the value of the parameter , @xmath178 is determined for a given @xmath119 , one may consider an operator ` perpendicular ' to @xmath179 ) , i.e. , @xmath180 , which may favor the high - lying state . alternatively",
    ", one may maximize the ews within the model space to determine the value @xmath181 of the operator to characterize the high - lying states .",
    "figure [ fig : sd - theta ] shows the strength distribution for these three types of operators at @xmath164 .",
    "the value @xmath182 suggests that , at this highly repulsive value of the interaction , a slightly in - phase type oscillation is favored in order to avoid an overlap of bosons and fermions , see the density distribution in ref  @xcite .",
    "we note that the distribution for the ` perpendicular ' operator @xmath183 is concentrated and is similar to the one for @xmath184 .",
    "the latter , however , is an almost bosonic type operator and suggest that the strength distribution alone is not sufficient to characterize the structure of high - lying states .",
    "a similar study has been made for a very attractive case @xmath170 . in this case",
    "we obtain @xmath185 , i.e. , almost in - phase , and the strength distribution is similar to fig .  [",
    "fig : sdim ] .",
    "thus the in - phase character of the low - lying mode which favors the overlap of the two kinds of particles is clearly seen in the determination of @xmath186 .",
    "dipole strength distributions for the in - phase and the out - of - phase operators are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsd - io ] .",
    "the strong peak in the in - phase strength distribution corresponds to the center - of - mass oscillation of the whole system . for many - particle systems confined in a common oscillator potential",
    "the center - of - mass motion is decoupled from other ( intrinsic ) degrees of freedom of the system , resulting in the oscillation with the same frequency @xmath10 .",
    "this relation can be represented by the commutation relation of the dipole operator and the hamiltonian , and should hold also within rpa @xcite . in the present numerical calculation , however , the state at @xmath187 does not exhaust the whole strength for the in - phase oscillation ; the largest deviation occurs at @xmath188 having 80% of the ews .",
    "this is because the single - particle model space in our numerical calculation is not sufficient to completely decouple the center of mass motion , especially at strong coupling cases where the deviation of the single particle potential from the oscillator becomes large .",
    "the @xmath143 sum rule is , nevertheless , almost satisfied as mentioned earlier , and is determined by the total number of bose and fermi particles , where the latter number is dependent on the value of @xmath119 .",
    "smaller value of the sum rule percentage at @xmath188 is mainly due to the appearance of the almost degenerate state ( @xmath189 ) at this energy .",
    "all other dipole oscillations should be orthogonal to the center - of - mass motion and thus are out - of - phase type in character .",
    "one may note that at repulsive values of @xmath12 the dominant part of the out - of - phase strength is located below @xmath10 , although the strength carried by each individual state is not very large . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this may reflect the ground state density distribution which favors the out - of - phase oscillation by making the overlap of boson and fermion distributions smaller .",
    "figure [ fig : tddo ] shows transition densities for the out - of - phase type oscillations at @xmath190 which carry the largest strengths ; @xmath191 for @xmath164 , @xmath192 for @xmath166 and @xmath193 for @xmath168 - 3.0 .",
    "bosons and fermions move in the opposite directions so as to make the overlap smaller around the surface of the boson distribution .",
    "one can observe that the bosonic transition density is large and robust , while the fermionic one is feeble and is spread over the whole system .",
    "this situation may be analogous to the soft dipole mode speculated in neutron - rich nuclei wherein the protons oscillate almost free in the sea of neutrons@xcite .",
    "dynamical structure factors corresponding to these states are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsf - d ] . here",
    "the bosonic and the fermionic responses are shown together with the one for a hypothetical out - of - phase type probe . by changing the momentum transfer one would find a structure corresponding to the oscillation of the two kinds of particles .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that for a very strong repulsion between bosons and fermions with sufficient number of particles , the system may become unstable towards a phase separation of the two kinds of particles . out - of - phase dipole strength distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsd - io ] indeed show a softening of the strength distribution at large value of @xmath119 .",
    "we can not conclude from the present calculation , however , if this tendency is related to the mentioned instability .",
    "one finds from the quadrupole strength distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : qsd - fb ] that the fermionic strength is split into low- and high - energy parts , while the bosonic one is concentrated .",
    "the higher strengths for the fermions are due to the 2@xmath194 excitation of the particle from the occupied single - particle states and are similar in character to the bosonic excitation .",
    "in contrast , the lower fermion strengths come from the matrix elements of the quadrupole operator @xmath195 which re - orient the single particle states within the same oscillator shell of @xmath101 around the fermi surface .",
    "this transition normally involves a change of nodes by one , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fspe ] , and the corresponding strengths are smaller than the higher ones .",
    "one may note that the quadrupole bosonic strength is located slightly higher than @xmath196 as expected for the collective oscillation in the large @xmath197 limit@xcite , which may be due to a rather small number of particles in the present calculation .",
    "we note that the strength distribution tends to be fragmented at large ( repulsive ) value of the interaction parameter @xmath119 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : qsd - fb ] .",
    "this is because the average potential deviates appreciably from the harmonic oscillator potential , giving rise to a dispersion in the fermion particle - hole energies , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fspe ] .",
    "strong fermion - boson interaction would then be responsible to scatter the bosonic strengths , too .",
    "octupole strength distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : osd - fb ] . here",
    "again the fermionic strength is split into @xmath194 and @xmath198 regions due to the character of the multipole operator @xmath199 .",
    "we note also that the frequency of the bosonic oscillation is much larger than the hydrodynamic value @xmath200@xcite .",
    "we find a striking change in the fermionic strength distributions depending on the sign of the bose - fermi interaction .",
    "while for a strongly repulsive case ( @xmath164 ) the region between the low- and high - lying states is almost filled up by small strengths , the one for a strongly attractive case ( @xmath201 ) shows a large gap in the strength distribution .",
    "this may be traced back to the structure of the single - particle states in fig .",
    "[ fig : fspe ] .",
    "the large strengths around @xmath202 are due to high orbital angular momentum states with @xmath203 which stay robust against @xmath119 as discussed earlier .",
    "smaller strengths due to low @xmath204 and @xmath205 states are , on the other hand , sensitive to the interaction , and the correponding particle - hole energies are below ( for @xmath206 ) or above ( for @xmath207 ) the unperturbed value @xmath202 . this may be understood by noting that the particles passing through the center ( small @xmath118 orbit ) feel the shallow ( for @xmath206 ) or deep ( for @xmath207 ) potentials and are thus more easy or hard to excite .",
    "for the strengths around @xmath10 different combinations of orbits are involved , and the strengths are broadened by the deviation from the oscillator potential .      to study the collective oscillation of the cold atomic gases , the current experiments on bec exert a time - dependent field on the system and then observe the time development of the shape and the size of the condensate@xcite .",
    "this procedure generally excites a number of normal modes , and one may in principle be able to resolve each mode by performing fourier transform as far as the time duration is long enough . to simulate the situation we consider a time evolution of the system after one applies an external weak pulse of the step - function type , i.e. , @xmath208 for @xmath209 .",
    "the calculation is performed within the lowest order perturbation theory .",
    "( @xmath210 is chosen as @xmath211 . )",
    "first we consider a perturbation of monopole type @xmath212 with @xmath213 which is applied to the ground state of the system for a short period @xmath210 .",
    "the effective frequency of the external oscillator potential for fermions and/or bosons is then changed into @xmath214 depending on the choice of @xmath215 .",
    "time dependence of the rms radius of bosons and fermions is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tdo - m ] at @xmath216 for the fermionic external field , @xmath217 .",
    "frequency of the short period oscillation is related to the average frequency of the strength distribution , e.g. , @xmath218 . that of the long period one , on the other hand , reflects the width of the distribution .",
    "for instance , the slow decrease of the envelope for @xmath219 would imply a very narrow width of the strength distribution . the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig : tdo - m ] shows the fourier transform of @xmath220 which recovers the sharp peak structure of the strength distribution in fig  [ fig : msd - fb ] .",
    "time evolution of the bosonic radius shows a rather regular modulation , and its beat frequency is estimated about @xmath221 , which is consistent with the half width @xmath222 .      for the dipole case",
    "we take the perturbing potential @xmath223 where @xmath224 measures the shift of the centers of the oscillator potentials felt by fermions and/or bosons . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tdo - d ] we show the time dependence of the center - of - masses of bosons and fermions for the out - of - phase external dipole impulse , @xmath225 , at @xmath226 .",
    "the frequency of the oscillation is consistent with the average frequency @xmath227 for the dipole strength distribution .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillation shows an irregular behavior , suggesting that the strength distribution does not have a simple structure .",
    "the lowest part of the figure shows the fourier transform of the relative distance of the fermion and boson center - of - mass positions , @xmath228 , which is sufficient to recover the behavior of the original strength distribution given in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsd - io ] .",
    "in the present paper we performed an rpa calculation of the polarized bose - fermi mixed system of alkali - metal gases at zero temperature . we solved a coupled gross - pitaevskii - thomas - fermi equations to obtain the ground state for several values of the boson - fermion interaction strength with a fixed value of the boson - boson interaction .",
    "single particle states of bose and fermi particles are calculated based on the mean field produced by the obtained ground state density .",
    "the density distribution constructed from the occupied single - particle orbits agrees well with the original one , suggesting the self - consistency of the calculation .",
    "we calculated and diagonalized the rpa matrix to obtain excitation energies and wave functions for multipoles @xmath2 .",
    "we then calculated strength distributions for bosonic / fermionic and in - phase / out - of - phase multipole operators , and also transition densities and dynamical structure factors for some of the collective states .",
    "we first calculated energy weighted moments of the strengths to study average behavior of the strength distribution .",
    "comparison of the first moments with the sum rule predictions for @xmath3 shows that the rpa configuration space is sufficient to within 1% .",
    "a glance at the monopole distribution suggests that fermions and bosons are moving rather independently for the adopted parameters , which turns out not to be the case if we study the dynamical structure factors .",
    "we find , in fact , that the long wavelength oscillation of fermions in the surface is coupled to the internal short - wavelength oscillation of bosons . for a strong attractive boson - fermion interaction ,",
    "the calculation suggests a softening of in - phase monopole oscillation .",
    "we studied also the structure of the low - lying out - of - phase type dipole modes .",
    "lowering of the energy is related to the ground state density distribution of bosons and fermions which favors the out - of - phase oscillation .",
    "transition densities for these modes suggest that the bosons oscillate on their way through the cloud of fermions , which is analogous to the soft dipole mode discussed in neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "we also calculated the strength distributions for quadrupole and octupole modes , and studied , in particular , the origin of the fragmentation of fermionic strengths .",
    "finally we considered time dependent behavior of the trapped bose - fermi system after an impulse of a multipole external field . by fourier transforming the time - dependent oscillating behavior of the system , we could recover the gross structure of the strength distribution .",
