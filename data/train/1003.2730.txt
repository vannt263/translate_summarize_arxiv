    "dark matter annihilations have two different and equally important roles in the phenomenology of dark matter models . on the one hand , the annihilation of dark matter particles in the early universe dictates , via the boltzmann equation , the expected relic density and , consequently , the viable parameter space of dark matter models .",
    "this parameter space is usually obtained by requiring , on top of accelerator and precision bounds , that the relic density be consistent with the observed dark matter density @xcite .",
    "hence , an accurate computation of the dark matter annihilation cross section is almost a prerequisite for dark matter studies .",
    "in addition , the present annihilation rate of dark matter particles determines the indirect detection signatures of dark matter .",
    "thus , to find the expected fluxes in gamma rays , neutrinos , and antimatter generated by dark matter annihilations , we must first compute properly the cross section for the annihilation of dark matter particles .",
    "up to now , most studies have only consider dark matter annihilations into either two - body final states , or three - body final states with a massless gauge boson @xcite , such as @xmath4 or @xmath5 , and have implicitly assumed that they dominate the total annihilation cross section .",
    "there exists , however , another class of three - body final states that may have an important impact on dark matter annihilations .",
    "they are final states consisting of a real and a virtual massive particle , such as @xmath0 ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath2 ( @xmath7 ) , and are the main subject of this paper .",
    "these three - body final states have not been considered in much detail in the literature .",
    "in fact , neither darksusy @xcite nor micromegas @xcite , two sophisticated programs commonly used to study the phenomenology of dark matter models , include any of these three - body final states in their calculations . to our knowledge , the only works where such final states have been considered are @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "chen and kamionkowski computed the cross section for neutralino annihilation into the three - body final states @xmath8 and @xmath2 and showed that , in certain regions of the parameter space , they can enhance the neutrino signal expected from neutralino annihilations . in that work , which has remained largely unnoticed over all these years , they did not study the possible effect of three - body final states on the neutralino relic abundance ; they simply stated that such effect should be negligible . in @xcite ,",
    "hosotani , ko , and tanaka considered stable higgs bosons as cold dark matter candidates in the context of gauge - higgs unification models . they found , using a semi - analytic approximation , that the inclusion of the three - body final state @xmath8 modifies significantly the prediction of the relic density for dark matter masses below the @xmath9 threshold . in this paper , we will update and improve these previous results in several ways .",
    "we will accurately compute the effect of three - body final states on the annihilation rate of dark matter particles and on their relic abundance in two well - motivated extensions of the standard model : the mssm and the singlet scalar model . in both cases , we find that the inclusion of three - body final states considerably affects the predicted relic density and the indirect detection signal of dark matter particles .",
    "we thus demonstrate that three - body final states consisting of a real and a virtual massive particle can not be generally neglected in dark matter annihilations .",
    "ordinarily , particle physics processes such as decays and annihilations are dominated provided that they are open by two - body final states .",
    "three - body final states are typically suppressed with respect to them by one additional coupling and one more propagator .",
    "exceptions to this behaviour are not uncommon though .",
    "the decay of the higgs boson in the standard model constitute a particularly striking example of the importance of three - body final states .",
    "an intermediate mass higgs boson , @xmath10 gev @xmath11 gev , decays mainly into a three body final state consisting of a real @xmath9 boson and a virtual one @xmath12 that in turn decays into a fermion - antifermion pair , @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this three - body final state accounts for more than @xmath14 of the branching for higgs masses above @xmath15 gev and dominates over @xmath16 in a wide region below the @xmath17 threshold .",
    "thus , to properly compute the higgs decay width and its branching ratios , two - body decays are not enough ; three - body final states must necessarily be taken into account . by the same token",
    ", we will see that , in some cases , to accurately compute the dark matter relic density and its indirect detection signals it is mandatory to include three - body final states .",
    "besides illustrating the need to go beyond two - body final states , the analogy with the decays of the higgs boson also allows us to foresee the conditions under which three - body final states are expected to be relevant in dark matter annihilations .",
    "notice that , in the higgs case , the decay @xmath18 becomes dominant once it is open , and it is below that threshold that the three - body decay ( into @xmath0 ) is important . for dark matter annihilations , accordingly , three - body final states could be relevant below the threshold of a standard model particle , @xmath19 , if the annihilation into @xmath20 becomes dominant for @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the mass of the dark matter particle . given that , in most dark matter models , @xmath23gev ( wimps ) , @xmath19 could be a @xmath9 ( or @xmath24 ) boson , a higgs boson , or a top - quark .",
    "hence , three - body final states might be relevant for dark matter masses below @xmath25 , @xmath26 , or @xmath27 . to satisfy the other condition observed in the higgs case , we need that the annihilation into @xmath17 , @xmath28 or @xmath29 become dominant above the respective threshold . thus , whether three - body final states turn out to be relevant or not will depend on the specific particle physics model considered and on the region of the parameter space examined .",
    "we will use two examples , singlet scalar dark matter and neutralino dark matter in the mssm , to illustrate the relevance of three - body final states in dark matter annihilations . in both cases",
    "we find regions in the parameter space where the inclusion of three - body final states modifies in a significant way the dark matter phenomenology of these models .",
    "]    the singlet scalar model @xcite is one of the simplest extensions of the standard model that may explain the dark mattter .",
    "it includes one additional scalar field , @xmath30 , that is neutral under the standard model gauge group and odd under a new discrete symmetry @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "this symmetry enforces the stability of @xmath30 and renders it a suitable dark matter candidate .",
    "this simple model introduces only two additional parameters to the standard model : the singlet mass , @xmath33 , and the coupling between the singlets and the higgs , @xmath34 .",
    "in addition , the higgs mass ( @xmath26 ) , a standard model parameter , also enters into dark matter calculations .",
    "it has been shown elsewhere , see e.g. @xcite , that the singlet scalar model can indeed explain the observed dark matter density and that it can be tested through direct and indirect detection in future experiments .    ]    in this model , singlets annihilate mainly through s - channel higgs boson exchange into standard model fermions and gauge bosons . among the two - body final states , the main annihilation channels are @xmath16 for @xmath35 and @xmath17 for @xmath36 .",
    "it is a situation analogous to that of higgs boson decays mentioned previously .",
    "henceforth , it is likely that within the mass range @xmath37 the annihilation cross section is actually dominated by the three - body final state @xmath0 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : diasinglet ] shows the feynmann diagram corresponding to the annihilation process into this three - body final state , @xmath39 , in the singlet model .",
    "notice that there are @xmath40 different final states contributing to that diagram .",
    "how important is this new contribution ?",
    "figure [ fig : singlet ] shows , as a function of the singlet mass , the ratio between the annihilation rate , @xmath41 , into the three - body final state @xmath0 and that into two - body final states , which is dominated by the @xmath16 contribution .",
    "the figure was obtained for @xmath42 , @xmath43 gev , and small @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , typical for dark matter particles annihilating in the galactic halo . to compute the cross sections we used the calchep @xcite and micromegas @xcite packages .",
    "even though @xmath46 and @xmath47 are both resonant for @xmath48 gev , their ratio has a smooth non - resonant behavior , as observed in the figure .",
    "moreover , because @xmath34 and @xmath26 affect both cross sections in the same way , the line shown in figure [ fig : singlet ] is actually independent of these parameters . in other words , it is a generic prediction of the singlet model .",
    "notice from the figure that already for @xmath49gev the three - body final state is not negligible , accounting for about @xmath14 of the cross section . for @xmath50gev , the two - body and the three - body cross sections",
    "are of the same order . finally , between @xmath50gev and @xmath51 , the singlet annihilation cross section is clearly dominated by the three - body final state .",
    "in fact , close to @xmath25 the cross section into @xmath0 is more than 10 times larger than the total cross section into two - body final states .",
    "hence , for singlet masses between @xmath52 gev and @xmath25 , the three - body final state can not be neglected in indirect detection studies , for it modifies considerably the total annihilation rate and the branching fractions into standard model particles , giving rise to different yields in photons , neutrinos , and antimatter .",
    "was set to @xmath53 .",
    "[ fig : rd120 ] ]    due to the higher dark matter velocity in the early universe and to the thermal averaging of the cross section , the effect of the three - body final state on the singlet relic density is expected to be smaller .",
    "it is significant nonetheless , as illustrated by figures [ fig : rd120]-[fig : rdsinglet ] .",
    "figure [ fig : rd120 ] compares the correct relic density ( solid line ) , obtained including two- and three - body final states , with the predicted relic density for two - body final states only ( dash - dotted line ) , as usually computed in the literature . for that figure",
    "we set @xmath43 gev and @xmath54 . to obtain these results we again used calchep , to compute the three - body contribution , and micromegas , to calculate the two - body part and to solve the boltzmann equation .",
    "both lines have the same generic behavior .",
    "the relic density initially increases as the singlet mass departs from the higgs resonance ( located at @xmath48 gev ) , it reaches a maximum , and it then decreases in the vicinity of the @xmath9-threshold .",
    "the value of the correct relic density , however , may differ significantly from that predicted for annihilation into two - body final states . at @xmath55 gev , for instance , the two - body approximation overestimates the cross section by more than a factor @xmath56 .",
    "was set to @xmath53 .",
    "[ fig : rd200 ] ]    a similar effect is present also for larger higgs masses , as illustrated in figure [ fig : rd200 ] . in this case",
    "the relic density is a decreasing function of the singlet mass .",
    "again , we observe that the two - body approximation overestimates the relic density for singlet masses between @xmath57 gev and @xmath25 . a better way to visualize the effect of the three - body final state on the relic density is by displaying the ratio of the correct relic density ( two and three - body ) to the two - body relic density , as done in figure [ fig : rdsinglet ] .",
    "notice that the ratio is significantly smaller than @xmath58 over a wide mass range and that it can decrease even below @xmath59 , a large deviation from the two - body result . from this figure",
    "we learn that in the singlet model the correct relic density could be significantly smaller than the relic density obtained for two - body final states .",
    "was set to @xmath53 .",
    "[ fig : rdsinglet ] ]    a detailed analysis of the resulting new parameter space of the singlet model , and of the implications of three - body final states for its direct and indirect detection prospects will be done in a future work .",
    "next , we will see the relevance of three - body final states for neutralino dark matter .",
    "]    for neutralino dark matter the most promising region where three - body final states may play an important role is below the top - quark threshold .",
    "that is , for neutralino masses in the range @xmath60 in this mass interval , neutralinos can annihilate into a @xmath2 pair followed by the decay of the virtual @xmath61 into @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "one of the diagrams that contribute to this process in the mssm is illustrated in figure [ fig : diamssm ] .",
    "for bino - like neutralinos , the dominant two - body annihilation channel in such mass interval is typically @xmath16 .",
    "can the three - body final state dominate over @xmath16 ?",
    ".supersymmetric parameters used .",
    "@xmath64 was allowed to vary freely.[table : mssm ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to ensure that diagrams with three - body final states , such as figure [ fig : diamssm ] , are not suppressed , we will focus on a region of the parameter space featuring a relatively light stop .",
    "table [ table : mssm ] shows the supersymmetric parameters , defined at low energy , that we consider in the following .",
    "they give rise to models compatible with present bounds from accelerator and precision data .",
    "the lightest stop , which is lighter than all other squarks thanks to the non - zero trilinear coupling @xmath65 , has a mass of about @xmath66 gev .",
    "the neutralino mass is determined by @xmath64 and is left as a free parameter to be varied in the range ( [ eq : range ] ) .",
    "the resulting lightest neutralino is always bino - like .",
    ".[fig : mssm ] ]    figure [ fig : mssm ] shows , as a function of the neutralino mass , the ratio between the cross section into the three - body final state @xmath2 and that one into two - body final states . since the latter is almost constant over the neutralino mass range shown , the variation observed in the figure is entirely due to the cross section into the three - body final state .",
    "as before , we took @xmath67 and used micromegas and calchep to compute the cross sections .",
    "notice from the figure that at @xmath68gev the three - body final state already reaches @xmath14 of the total annihilation cross section . for @xmath69gev ,",
    "the three - body final state contribute to the cross section as much as the two - body states . for larger masses , up to the top threshold ,",
    "the neutralino annihilation cross section is entirely dominated by the three - body final state .",
    "in that region , the two - body final state approximation commonly used in previous works would fail badly , underestimating the neutralino annihilation cross section and misjudging the resulting final states . as a consequence ,",
    "neither the normalization nor the spectrum of the @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 generated in neutralino annihilations would be correct .    ]    the effect of the three - body final state on the neutralino relic density is illustrated in figures [ fig : relicmssm ] and [ fig : rdmssm7 ] . in the calculation , coannihilation effects between the neutralino and the lightest stop are automatically taken into account .",
    "they are not important though , because the mass difference between them is significant .",
    "notice that the correct neutralino abundance , calculated including the three - body final state , could be more than @xmath14 smaller than that obtained taking into account only two - body final states , as usually done in the literature .    in view of these results ,",
    "the claim that darksusy computes the neutralino relic density , for any mssm model , with an accuracy of @xmath74 @xcite no longer holds . to reach that accuracy , the three - body final states studied in this work",
    "must necessarily be included in the calculation .    in any case , notice that , in contrast with the singlet model studied in the previous section , the large effect due to three - body final states below the top threshold is not a generic feature of the mssm .",
    "it is only within certain configurations , for specific sets of parameters , that the effect becomes important",
    ". it must be also said that there certainly exist additional corrections not included in our analysis , such as one - loop corrections to the cross sections and toponium resonance effects below the top threshold , that could also modify the neutralino annihilation cross section and the predicted neutralino relic density in the mssm .",
    "the most significant feature brought about by dark matter annihilation into the three - body final state @xmath2 in supersymmetric models is that , as we have seen , it may give rise to large corrections to the neutralino annihilation cross section and to the relic density of neutralino dark matter .    ]",
    "we have shown that three - body final states consisting of a real and a virtual massive particle may play an important role in dark matter annihilations .",
    "two well - motivated scenarios were used to illustrate this effect : the singlet scalar and the mssm . in both cases , we demonstrated that these new contributions can significantly modify the prediction for the relic density of dark matter and for its indirect detection signatures . in a future work",
    "we will study in more detail the implications of these results .",
