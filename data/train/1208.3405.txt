    "in order to achieve the highest possible luminosity in a collider  @xcite , the colliding beams must be focused to a small spot at the interaction point ( ip ) .",
    "this tight focusing is unavoidably accompanied by a large transverse beam extension before the beam enters the final focusing block ( ffb ) .",
    "the size of the required beam extension is determined by the desired degree of beam squeezing at the ip and the focal length of the ffb , which is closely related to the space between the ip and the nearest focusing quadrupole .",
    "the larger this distance , the greater the beam extension must be . since the ffb s focal length depends on the particle s momentum , the large beam size inside the ffb leads to a large correlation between the particle s phase advance and its momentum  @xcite .",
    "the problem with such a correlation is two - fold .",
    "first of all , it induces a large chromatic betatron tune spread .",
    "since the available betatron tune space is limited by the beam resonances , the chromatic betatron tune dependence limits the ring s momentum aperture .",
    "secondly , the chromatic dependence of the focal length causes chromatic beam smear at the ip , which can even dominate over the beam size due to the emittance , significantly increasing the beam spot size at the ip and resulting in luminosity loss .",
    "thus , an interaction region ( ir ) design must employ sextupole magnets to compensate the chromatic effects  @xcite .",
    "however , the nonlinear sextupole fields generate 2nd- and higher - order aberrations to the particle trajectory at the ip , introduce nonlinear phase advance and limit the ring s dynamic aperture .",
    "compensation of these nonlinear effects is one of the main challenges of an ir and , even more generally , collider ring design .",
    "a commonly used chromaticity compensation technique is to install same - strength sextupoles in pairs with @xmath0 ( minus the identity ) transformation between them to cancel their nonlinear kicks  @xcite .",
    "however , this approach does not treat all of the sextupole - induced 2nd - order effects .",
    "besides , organizing @xmath0 transformations for the sufficient number of sextupole pairs for simultaneous compensation of the horizontal and vertical chromaticities is difficult .",
    "the concept described below not only includes all of the @xmath0 transformation benefits but goes further by compensating all of the 2nd - order effects together with the 2nd - order beam smear at the ip .",
    "it also offers a more compact compensation scheme .",
    "the ir design approach presented in this paper involves installation of a dedicated chromaticity compensation block ( ccb ) next to the ffb  @xcite . in the ccb",
    ", certain symmetries of the beam orbital motion and dispersion are created using a symmetric arrangement of dipoles and quadrupoles .",
    "two such ccbs are placed symmetrically around the ip .",
    "the symmetries of the beam orbital motion and dispersion combined with a symmetric quadrupole and sextupole arrangement in the ccbs then allow simultaneous compensation of the 1st - order chromaticities and chromatic beam smear at the ip without inducing significant 2nd - order aberrations and therefore helping preserve the ring s dynamic aperture .    a schematic ir layout is shown in fig .  [ fig : irscheme1 ] .",
    "the beam extension section ( bes ) first expands the beam from its regular size in the arcs to the size required for final focusing .",
    "the beam next passes through the ccb , which creates in it an angle spread negatively correlated with the chromatic kick of the ffb , so that the ffb s chromatic effect is cancelled .",
    "the ffb then focuses the beam to the required spot size at the ip .",
    "the ir design is mirror - symmetric with respect to the ip .",
    "in general , compensation of chromatic effects of a focusing lattice requires introduction of dipole and sextupole magnets along the lattice .",
    "the dipole field changes the beam reference orbit and creates dispersion , i.e. orbit dependence on the particle energy .",
    "the sextupole field then introduces an additional energy - dependent focusing strength to counter the original chromatic effect of the quadrupoles .",
    "the particle motion in the horizontal @xmath1 and vertical @xmath2 planes about the reference orbit is described by the following equations  @xcite : @xmath3 where the prime @xmath4 denotes a derivative with respect to the longitudinal coordinate @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the curvature of the bent reference orbit , @xmath7 is the normalized quadrupole strength , and @xmath8 is the particle s relative momentum deviation from the reference value .",

    "the quantities @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and , therefore , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are functions of @xmath5 .",
    "the particle trajectory in the horizontal plane can be represented as a superposition of the dispersive component @xmath17 and the betatron component @xmath18 : @xmath19 where the dispersion function @xmath20 satisfies the equation @xmath21 then the evolution of the betatron component is determined by the following equations : @xmath22    sextupoles are usually placed in the ring arcs to compensate the energy dependence of the global betatron tunes . in that case , the chromaticity compensating sextupoles need to be configured to satisfy only two conditions associated with the @xmath23 and @xmath24 terms on the right hand side of eq .",

    "however , local chromatic effects in short sections or even at specific points like the ip where the beam experiences a strong transverse compression are generally not compensated on average in one turn .",

    "[ fig : chrom_dep_ds_2sxt ] .",

    "are also calculated using particle tracking and plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : freqmap_ds ] and [ fig : tunefp_ds ] , respectively .",
    "because of such a large chromatic tune spread , the particles experience numerous resonances , which limit the momentum acceptance .",
    "a ring s property that is equally important to its momentum acceptance is its dynamic aperture ( da ) , i.e. a region in the transverse plane of stable particle motion .",
    "therefore , we study the ion collider ring s da for the case of the ccb - based chromaticity compensation scheme .",
    "the da is explored by tracking particles for 1000  turns while progressively increasing their initial horizontal @xmath63 and vertical @xmath64 amplitudes until the boundary between survival and loss is found .",
    "figure  [ fig : da_nooct ] shows the on - momentum particle s da at the entrance into one of the ccbs .",
    "the da reaches @xmath65  mm horizontally and @xmath66  mm vertically , which is quite reasonable given the large natural chromaticities and the fact that there was no nonlinear optimization after the linear chromaticity correction .",
    "however , due to the large beam extension required to achieve the ambitiously small @xmath67 values at the meic ( see table  [ tab : meicpar ] ) , these horizontal and vertical da sizes correspond to only @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "thus , optimization of the da using multiple sextupole and octupole families is required .    for the on - momentum particle",
    ", there is clearly no tune variation due to the chromatic tune dependence .",
    "the tune change comes from the nonlinearity of the transverse betatron motion caused by the nonlinear fields , in particular , of the sextupoles .",
    "thus , we explore the dependence of the betatron tunes on the transverse motion . for a particle with initial transverse amplitudes @xmath1 and @xmath2 , its horizontal @xmath60 and vertical @xmath61 tunes are calculated by tracking it for a number of turns .",
    "the obtained tune dependence is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : amptunedep_nooct ] : @xmath60 is plotted as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 at the top while @xmath61 is plotted as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 at the bottom .",
    "the simulations show that , after the sextupole compensation , there is a large amplitude - dependent tune shift .",
    "this is due to the fact the nonlinearity of the sextupole fields causes stronger focusing of the particles with larger transverse amplitudes . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : amptunedep_nooct ] , @xmath60 and @xmath61 change from the design values by 0.08 ( the red line in the top plot ) and 0.04 ( the blue line in the bottom plot ) , respectively , within @xmath1 and @xmath2 of about @xmath70  mm .",
    "such a large tune deviation can easily drive particles to approach or cross betatron resonances , which inevitably causes their loss .",
    "the tune shift with amplitude limits the ring s da , especially in the horizontal direction due to the large horizontal beam extension in the ion collider ring ( the maximum horizontal rms beam size @xmath71 along the ring is 3.2  mm ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : amptunedep_nooct ] also shows that there is very little coupling between the two transverse dimensions : @xmath60 is almost independent of the vertical motion ( the blue line in the top plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : amptunedep_nooct ] ) while @xmath61 is unaffected by the horizontal motion ( the red line in the bottom plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : amptunedep_nooct ] ) .    a straightforward mechanism to compensate the amplitude - dependent tune shift caused by the sextupoles is to introduce octupoles .",
    "depending on the octupole locations , both the amplitude dependent tune shift and higher - order chromaticities can be controlled by adjusting the octupole strengths .",
    "since the momentum acceptance is large enough after the linear chromaticity correction with the ccbs , we focus on compensation of the amplitude - dependent tune shift . therefore",
    ", octupole families should be placed in dispersion - free regions to leave the chromatic correction unaffected . also , to reduce the required octupole strengths",
    ", they should be placed at large @xmath72-function points . following these considerations , three families of octupoles",
    "are introduced in the bes and ffb regions .",
    "it was the most convenient for us to find a solution for the octupole strengths that provide compensation of the 1st - order amplitude dependent tune shifts , using the arbitrary - order expansion tools of cosy infinity  @xcite .",
    "after this compensation , the horizontal and vertical tune variations are again obtained as functions of the initial transverse amplitudes @xmath1 and @xmath2 from particle tracking and are plotted in fig .  [ fig : amptunedep_withoct ] .",
    "compared to the tune changes of 0.08 and 0.04 within the transverse amplitude of about @xmath70  mm in fig .",
    "[ fig : amptunedep_nooct ] , the horizontal and vertical tune changes are now 0.04 and 0.03 , respectively , within an amplitude range of over @xmath73  mm .",
    "consequently , the da is increased as shown by the blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig : da_withoct ] in comparison to the red line without the octupole optimization .    after the octupole compensation ,",
    "the limitation on the da comes from the effect of the 2nd - order amplitude - dependent tune shift , which starts dominating the tune behavior in fig .",
    "[ fig : amptunedep_withoct ] .",
    "this provides a guideline that the da can be further enhanced by considering and optimizing the 1st- , 2nd- , and even higher - order amplitude - dependent effects .",
    "one possibility for future studies is to use a genetic algorithm to optimize the da directly by simultaneously adjusting multiple sextupole and octupole families  @xcite .",
    "note that magnet errors are not included in the above simulations .",
    "addressing the question of error tolerances is the subject of our future studies .",
    "we proposed a new symmetry - based interaction region concept for a high - luminosity collider ring design .",
    "such a symmetric design allows simultaneous compensation of ( a ) the betatron tune spreads due to the 1st - order chromaticities , ( b ) chromatic beam smear at the ip , i.e. chromatic spread of focal point , and ( c ) other 2nd - order aberrations to the particle trajectory at the ip and on average over one turn , such as the 2nd - order dispersion effect and sextupole - generated beam smear due to the beam size . according to this concept , two specially - designed symmetric chromaticity compensation blocks ( ccbs )",
    "are placed symmetrically around an ip .",
    "each ccb induces an angle spread in the passing beam such that it cancels the chromatic kick of the final focusing quadrupoles .",
    "we developed an analytic description of this approach and explicitly formulated 2nd - order aberration compensation conditions at the ip .",

    "<S> we present a new symmetry - based concept for an achromatic low - beta collider interaction region design . a specially - designed symmetric chromaticity compensation block ( ccb ) </S>",
    "<S> induces an angle spread in the passing beam such that it cancels the chromatic kick of the final focusing quadrupoles . </S>",
    "<S> two such ccbs placed symmetrically around an interaction point allow simultaneous compensation of the 1st - order chromaticities and chromatic beam smear at the ip without inducing significant 2nd - order aberrations to the particle trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> we first develop an analytic description of this approach and explicitly formulate 2nd - order aberration compensation conditions at the interaction point . </S>",
    "<S> the concept is next applied to develop an interaction region design for the ion collider ring of an electron - ion collider . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically evaluate performance of the design in terms of momentum acceptance and dynamic aperture . </S>",
    "<S> the advantages of the new concept are illustrated by comparing it to the conventional distributed - sextupole chromaticity compensation scheme . </S>"
