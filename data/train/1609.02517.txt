    "in multi - user wideband wireless systems , two fundamental obstacles limit the gains in spectral efficiency :    * inter - symbol interference ( isi ) : in a wideband communication system that uses a band - limited signal , isi is fundamentally unavoidable when the transmission bandwidth @xmath1 exceeds the coherence bandwidth @xmath2 of the channel .",
    "isi distorts the signal between subsequent transmitted symbols ; this effect limits the spectral efficiency of a wideband communication system . * inter - user interference ( iui ) : in a multi - cell communication system that uses universal frequency reuse per cell , iui ( or inter - cell interference ) is also inevitable .",
    "iui limits the spectral efficiency of the multi - cell system , because it reduces signal - to - interference plus noise ratio ( sinr ) of the users .",
    "the problem of mitigating both isi and iui simultaneously is challenging in general .",
    "the common approach has been to deal with the problem of mitigating them separately .",
    "for example , orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm)@xcite is a well - known method that successfully removes isi in single - user wideband communication systems .",
    "the key principle of the ofdm is to change the linear convolution relation between input signals and the impulse response of the isi channel to be the circular convolution between them by adding an appropriate cyclic prefix .",
    "then , using the inverse discrete fourier transform ( idft ) as transmit eigen - beamforming , and the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) as receive eigen - beamforming , the isi channel is decomposed into a set of orthogonal subchannels ( subcarriers ) .",
    "essentially , this channel decomposition creates multiple parallel gaussian channels , each experiencing isi - free narrowband flat fading .",
    "it has shown that this strategy achieves the capacity of the isi channel with a simple water - filling power allocation @xcite in an asymptotic sense , as the number of subcarriers tends to infinity .",
    "the concept of this channel decomposition creating parallel subchannels has been extensively extended to multi - user scenarios @xcite by incorporating iui .",
    "for instance , by allowing two transmitters to share an ofdm symbol to communicate with a receiver , the capacity region for such multiple access channel ( mac ) with isi was characterized in @xcite .",
    "similarly , the capacity for the two - user interference channel with isi is also established , especially when iui is strong @xcite .",
    "the common achievable scheme revealing the capacity results is the use of separate coding over each subchannel with multiuser water - filling algorithms based on game - theoretic optimization . for the general case of the @xmath0-user interference channel with isi , which can be transformed into the @xmath0-user parallel gaussian interference channel by ofdm @xcite ,",
    "the capacity remains open .",
    "it has shown in @xcite that the optimal sum degrees of freedom ( sum - dof ) of the parallel @xmath0-user interference channel is @xmath3 , assuming the channel coefficients are independent across subchannels .",
    "the key to this sum - dof characterization is a novel iui management method , referred to as _ interference alignment _ ( ia ) .",
    "in contrast to the gaussian point - to - point , multiple access , and broadcast channels with isi in which separate coding is optimal @xcite , joint encoding across subchannels has shown to provide a significant spectral efficiency gain over separate coding when signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is high for the parallel gaussian interference channel @xcite .    despite the significant gains , ia requires global and instantaneous channel state information at transmitter ( csit ) , so",
    "ia is too difficult to be used as a practical interference management solution in many multi - user wideband wireless systems .    in the absence of knowledge about csit",
    ", the sum - dof of numerous wireless networks is the same as what is achievable by time - division multiple access ( tdma ) among users @xcite .",
    "recent research on ia has made progress towards using limited csit to realize the gains of ia in practical wireless systems @xcite .",
    "blind interference alignment @xcite is a representative technique that uses the knowledge of channel coherence patterns at the transmitters instead of instantaneous channel coefficients themselves .",
    "however , diversity of coherence intervals among different receivers can naturally occur in wireless channels ( or can be induced artificially using reconfigurable antennas @xcite ) ; by exploiting this diversity , one can achieve the same dof in an siso interference channel as that attained with perfect knowledge of csit @xcite .",
    "the impediment to implementing these techniques is that to construct a particular super - symbol structure , the cooperative transmitters must know the channel coherence pattern information ( second - order channel statistics ) from all receivers .",
    "due to insertion loss in rf circuits , the use of switching - reconfigurable antennas @xcite is also not preferable to current wireless systems .    in this paper , we consider a single - input - single - output ( siso ) @xmath0-user interference channel with isi as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "it is important to notice that this channel model is not necessarily equivalent to the parallel ( or multi - carrier ) gaussian interference channel .",
    "one can transform the interference channel with isi to the corresponding multi - carrier interference channel by using the decomposition approach by ofdm @xcite , but not necessarily vice versa . throughout the paper , we focus on assumptions that the channel coefficients are linear time - invariant ( lti ) with finite - length impulse response .",
    "most importantly , we assume that transmitters have completely lack csit ; i.e. , that they do not even know channel coherence patterns that are essential for implementing the conventional blind interference alignment @xcite . in this",
    "setting , _ the fundamental question we address in this paper is whether the sum - spectral efficiency can be made to scale linearly with @xmath0 , even with complete lack of csit . _",
    "our major contribution of this paper is to show that the answer to this question is affirmative in some isi conditions .",
    "more precisely , we demonstrate that the sum - dof of the @xmath0-user interference channel with isi is @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the maximum impulse response lengths of the desired and interfering links , respectively .",
    "for example , when @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath3 sum - dof can be achieved in a channel that has isi .",
    "this is a remarkable result because it has shown that the optimal sum - dof of the multi - carrier @xmath0-user siso interference channel , @xmath3 , is achievable only when global and perfect csit is available @xcite or the specialized channel realizations occur @xcite .",
    "our result , however , shows that , with complete lack of csit , the sum - dof increases linearly with @xmath0 no matter how the channel coefficients realized , provided that @xmath9 .    to show the achievability of this result , we introduce a novel communication method , called _ interference - free ofdm ( if - ofdm)_. the principal idea of if - ofdm is to convert the effective channel matrices of all interfering wireless links to circulant channel matrices , while keeping the non - circulant structure for the channel matrix of the desired link by judiciously choosing the cyclic prefix size .",
    "using the fact that column vectors of an idft matrix are the common right eigenvectors of circulant matrices , each transmitter sends its information along a set of linearly independent column vectors of the idft matrix .",
    "this strategy essentially allows aligning all the interference within the same subspace at each receiver , while the desired signals remain out of the interference subspace . by projecting the received signals onto the subspace that is orthogonal to the interference subspace ,",
    "all iui are removed perfectly . once iui is eliminated ,",
    "each receiver decodes the desired information symbols by removing the remaining inter - subcarrier interference .    by using this method",
    ", we also characterize an achievable sum - spectral efficiency of the @xmath0-user interference channel with isi under two csit assumptions on the desired link . for the case of completely absent csit",
    ", we obtain a closed - form expression of the sum - spectral efficiency that achieved by the concatenation of two transmission methods : 1 ) if - ofdm for mitigating iui and 2 ) zero - forcing based successive interference cancellation ( zf - sic ) to remove inter - subcarrier interference .",
    "furthermore , when a transmitter can learn csit from its paired receiver only , we also yield a characterization of an achievable sum - spectral efficiency of the @xmath0-user interference channel with isi . to derive this result ,",
    "a two - stage precoding method is presented , which essentially concatenates if - ofdm to mitigate iui and singular value decomposition ( svd ) based vector coding with water - filling power allocation to reject inter - carrier interference .",
    "one remarkable feature of the proposed method is the use of separate encoding across subchannels ; this implies that a data symbol of each transmitter is sent through a subcarrier .",
    "this fact is both practically relevant and theoretically interesting , because it reveals that separate encoding achieves a significant spectral efficiency gain in a multi - carrier interference channel .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe a system model of the siso @xmath0-user interference channel with isi in section ii .",
    "we illustrate the key idea of the proposed if - ofdm through simple examples in section iii .",

    "* remark 6 ( comparison with tdma - ofdm ) : * the proposed communication strategy resembles with the ofdm transmission method , which is widely used in the contemporary wireless systems ( e.g. lte and wifi ) .",
    "for example , if each transmitter - and - receiver pair sends @xmath42 data symbols by using @xmath42-point ifft operation with the addition of cyclic prefix length @xmath246 in a round - robin fashion , the sum - dof of the @xmath0-user interference with isi is @xmath247 as @xmath42 goes infinity , it converges to unity .",
    "this trend implies that the ofdm method does not scale with the number of @xmath0 .",
    "the proposed transmission method can be interpreted as a variant of the conventional ofdm transmission , because if - ofdm also uses idft to transform a set of data symbols .",
    "nevertheless , the two methods differ .",
    "the key differences are : 1 ) the selection of cyclic prefix size and 2 ) the use of the subcarriers to remove iui .",
    "if - ofdm selects the cyclic prefix size to create the relativity of the channel structure , whereas ofdm chooses the size to create parallel subchannels of the desired link by removing ici .",
    "furthermore , the proposed method uses a set of column vectors of the idft matrix during transmit mode , and the receiver applies the non - overlapping column vectors of the dft matrix to reject iui . the conventional ofdm transmission , however , uses the same set of column vectors of idft and dft matrices in transmitting and receiving mode .",
    "it is instructive to consider an example to provide a better understanding our result .",
    "* example 3 : * suppose a symmetric case in which with @xmath248 , @xmath45 , and @xmath249 ; these parameters correspond to the scenario where two dominant multi - paths exist with the line - of - sight path in the desired channels , but no effective multi - paths are resolved in the interference channels . because @xmath241 , no cyclic prefix is needed in this example .",

    "we first explain some scenarios in which the proposed method shows a better sum - dof gain in interference networks when csit is not available . in the sequel , we discuss some practical ways how to apply the proposed method when @xmath98 .      in this subsection , we consider two channel models : 1 ) multiple - input - single - output ( miso ) broadcast channel with isi and 2 ) multiple - input - multiple - output ( mimo ) frequency - flat @xmath0-user interference channel with a circulant structure .",
    "one interesting observation is that the proposed method is directly applicable to a miso broadcast channel with isi when csit is not available .",

    "in what follows , we present this claim precisely .",

    "let @xmath21 be the number of channel - taps from the @xmath26th transmit antenna to the @xmath18th user . with completely no csit ,",
    "the sum - dof of this channel is lower bounded by @xmath323    since the cooperation of @xmath0 antennas at the transmitter does not degrade the sum - dof , corollary 1 holds from theorem [ theorem1 ] .",
    "consider a frequency - flat ( narrowband ) mimo @xmath0-user interference channel in which all transmitters and receivers have @xmath143 antennas .",
    "let @xmath324 be the channel matrix from transmitter @xmath26 to receiver @xmath18 .",
    "the following corollary shows the sum - dof of the mimo interference channel with a special channel structure .    *",
    "corollary 2:*suppose @xmath325 be a circulant matrix for @xmath159 and @xmath326 be a non - circulant matrix composed of elements drawn from a continuous distribution .",
    "then , when csit is not available , the proposed method achieves the sum - dof of this channel as @xmath327    the proof is direct from theorem [ theorem1 ] .",
    "when @xmath104 , one can also apply the proposed idea by treating a fraction of isi as additional noise .",
    "this approach is of interest to the case when a distance - dependent large - scale model is incorporated in multi - cell wireless systems .",
    "* example 4 : * let @xmath328 be the distance between transmitter @xmath26 to receiver @xmath18 in the network .",

    "more rigorous system - level performance evaluation should be conducted to gauge the practical gain ; we leave this for future work .",
    "we have demonstrated that the sum - dof of the siso @xmath0-user interference channel with isi can increase linearly with @xmath0 , even when csit is totally absent .",
    "this result is surprising because , in the siso interference channel even without isi , this linear sum - dof gain with respect to @xmath0 is achievable when global and perfect csit are available across all transmitters or special channel patterns occur ; this requirement has been a major obstacle to implementing interference alignment in practice .",
    "our main result is proven by introducing a novel communication strategy , if - ofdm .",
    "the main idea of the scheme is to create relativity of alignment based on different matrix structures , i.e. , circulant and non - circulant structures , which are not subject to the realization of the channel coefficients .    a promising direction for future work is to consider a multi - antenna setting , ( e.g. , a multiple - input - multiple - output ( mimo ) @xmath0-user interference channel with isi ) , to determine whether the sum - dof can increase with the both the numbers of antennas and of users when csit is unavailable .",
    "other directions for future work include a study of system - level performance for our proposed scheme in cooperative cellular networks .",
    "in particular , by using a stochastic geometry framework @xcite , one can obtain a closed - form expression of the sinr distribution and gauge the gains in terms of spatially - averaged ergodic spectral efficiency to revisit the fundamental limit of cooperation @xcite .",
