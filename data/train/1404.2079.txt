    "entanglement entropy , a popular measure to quantify quantum entanglement , has become a subject of intensive theoretical investigation , especially for systems with many degrees of freedom @xcite and is being used to characterize properties of a wide spectrum of systems like quantum information processing @xcite , quantum phase transition @xcite and entropy of black holes @xcite .",
    "however , the entanglement entropy of free quantized fields is found to be divergent @xcite and some form of regularization has to be used in order to extract useful information from it ( also see @xcite in this context ) .",
    "furthermore , in general , it is difficult to get an analytic handle on entanglement entropy except for a few special cases like @xmath0 dimensional cfts @xcite .    in this work , with the aim to gain a better understanding of the divergence of entanglement entropy as well as to have better analytic control , we consider in detail the entanglement entropy of free scalar field regularized on a spatial lattice in @xmath0-dimensional space - time . with the insights gained in @xmath2 dimensions",
    ", we extend the results to higher dimensions .",
    "specifically , we obtain analytical expression for the entanglement entropy by tracing over a single oscillator of the lattice regularized scalar field .",
    "the analytical expression provides two interesting features which , to our knowledge , have not been noted in the literature : ( i ) entanglement entropy is invariant under a scaling transformation even when the hamiltonian is not , and ( ii ) the divergence in entanglement entropy in @xmath3 dimensions in the continuum limit is due to the presence of a large number of near zero modes ( and is not of uv origin as commonly believed ) . in the case of higher dimensions ,",
    "accumulation of zero modes occur , however , the entropy remains finite ( non - divergent ) .    the work is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we start with the discretized version of free , massive scalar field in @xmath0 dimensions and define the covariance matrix for the corresponding hamiltonian and show its relation to the entanglement entropy . in section ( 3 ) , after performing a canonical transformation on the phase space of the scalar field theory , we show that the divergence of entanglement entropy in the continuum is due to the presence of near zero frequency modes .",
    "it is further shown that the entropy is divergent even when a single oscillator is traced over .",
    "section ( 4 ) is devoted to regulating this divergence using a suitable infra - red cut - off . in section ( 5 )",
    "we consider the effect of spatial dimensions on entanglement entropy of free fields .",
    "we conclude in section ( 6 ) .",
    "we set @xmath4 .",
    "the system of interest is the @xmath0 dimensional massive , free scalar field theory described by the lagrangian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the mass of the scalar field .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath7 as mentioned earlier , the ground state entanglement entropy for such a system is divergent . in order to gain better understanding of the divergence",
    ", we place the system on a spatial lattice with lattice spacing @xmath8 .",
    "using the notation @xmath9 @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the position of the lattice points , the discretized hamiltonian is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the canonically conjugate momentum of @xmath14 .",
    "it is important to note that we have an infinite lattice in mind so that @xmath15 ; the continuum limit corresponds to @xmath16 . in the following",
    "we assume periodic boundary conditions @xmath17 ( the final results are , however , independent of the specific choice of boundary conditions ) .",
    "our aim is to analytically calculate the entanglement entropy of the ground state wave - function of the above hamiltonian obtained by tracing over first @xmath18 oscillators .",
    "this can be done by finding the ground state wave - function and then performing the partial trace . however , for greater generality , instead of taking this route , we calculate the entanglement entropy by finding the covariance matrix , which for the hamiltonian is the following @xmath19 matrix @xcite @xmath20.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above equation @xmath21 are the normal mode frequencies @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the potential matrix of the hamiltonian .",
    "the matrix elements of the ` position ' correlation @xmath24 and ` momentum ' correlation @xmath25 depend only on the separation @xmath26 between the @xmath27th and the @xmath28th oscillators .    the reduced state obtained after tracing over @xmath29 oscillators can be characterized from its covariance matrix @xmath30 by picking appropriate elements from the total matrix .",
    "the entanglement entropy is given by @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the symplectic eigen values of the reduced covariance matrix .",
    "to have better analytic control in order to identify the scaling symmetry , we consider the simplest case of the single oscillator reduced system @xmath33 , for which the covariance matrix is @xmath34.\\ ] ]    here we would like to note a couple of things regarding the covariance matrix .",
    "the @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) element of the covariance matrix , often referred to in the literature as the ` position ' ( momentum ) covariance @xcite , is @xmath37 in the continuum limit ( @xmath16 ) , the position covariance diverges while the momentum covariance is finite ( non - zero value ) .",
    "hence , the product @xmath38 , which is the determinant of the covariance matrix , diverges .",
    "this determinant    @xmath39    is the eigenvalue @xmath40 , from which the entropy can be calculated using .",
    "the following points are worth noting regarding the above result : ( i ) the entropy is invariant under the scaling transformations @xmath41 and ( ii ) in the continuum limit , @xmath16 , @xmath42 and , with the summations going over to integrals , the entanglement entropy @xmath43 since the numerator in diverges for @xmath44 .",
    "this is the familiar uv - divergence of the entanglement entropy in the continuum .    in the next section ,",
    "we show that the canonical transformation of the variables @xmath45 which accounts for the scaling symmetry will lead to a hamiltonian that can be separated into a scale invariant and a scale dependent part .",
    "the entanglement entropy of the resultant hamiltonian leads to a new way of identifying the cause of the divergence .",
    "to take into account the scaling symmetry , we introduce the following canonical rescaling of the hamiltonian @xmath46 in terms of these variables the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath47 here we have defined @xmath48 it is interesting to note that ( i ) under the scaling transformation , @xmath49 while @xmath50 is scale invariant .",
    "thus , in writing the hamiltonian , we have separated the scale invariant part of the hamiltonian from the scale dependent part ( which appears solely in the factor @xmath51 ) .",
    "( ii ) the canonical transformations ( [ rescaling the canonical variables ] ) are well - defined for all values of @xmath8 ( including the continuum limit whereby @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) .",
    "( the above canonical transformations have been discussed by botero and reznik @xcite in a different context . )    since the determinant of the covariance matrix and , hence , the entanglement entropy are invariant under the canonical transformations , we can express the determinant of the covariance matrix ( [ determinant reduced state ] ) in terms of @xmath50 by pulling out a factor of @xmath54 from both the numerator and the denominator leading to @xmath55    this points to the fact that , for the purpose of evaluation of the entanglement entropy , instead of working with the full hamiltonian ( [ discretized hamiltonian in terms of rescaled variables ] ) , it is sufficient to work with the following ` effective ' hamiltonian @xmath56 from which we identify the following normal mode frequencies @xmath57 note that @xmath58 is related to the normal mode frequency @xmath59 defined in by @xmath60    thus , the resultant entanglement entropy depends _ only _ on the scale - invariant parameter @xmath50 . as pointed out earlier , in the continuum limit @xmath50 is finite while @xmath61 diverges .",
    "( [ covariance matrix for discretized scalar field in terms of beta ] ) gives insight into the real cause of the divergence . to understand this ,",
    "let us first consider the case where @xmath52 . for @xmath62 mode ,",
    "the effective normal mode frequency is @xmath63 .",
    "this implies that in eq .   the discrete sum over @xmath27 would diverge because of the appearance of ( at least ) one term with zero in the denominator ( the zero mode term )",
    "this shows that the divergence is due to the zero mode of @xmath58 .",
    "in fact , in this limit , large number of near - zero modes _ accumulate _ leading to the vanishing of the effective normal mode frequencies and hence divergence of the entanglement entropy .",
    "another ( heuristic ) way to understand how the innocuous canonical transformation ( [ rescaling the canonical variables ] ) identifies the divergence of the entanglement entropy due to the near - zero modes is to look at the effective hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian without e0 ] ) . in the continuum limit ,",
    "the last term on the right becomes @xmath64 and this term cancels the second term in the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian without e0 ] ) .",
    "thus , in the continuum limit , there are large number of modes which effectively behave as free particles . in the context of quantum field theory ,",
    "zero modes are excluded on the grounds that they are not normalizable and that they do not have particle interpretation .",
    "although the zero modes have no physical effects , they carry @xcite an undetermined , non - zero energy @xmath65 .",
    "this undetermined non - zero energy indicates the divergence of the entanglement entropy in @xmath0dimensions .",
    "having identified the divergence of the entanglement entropy in the continuum due to the presence of zero frequency modes , we still need to isolate the divergent term from the finite terms .",
    "we start by taking @xmath67 limit in eq . , and replace the summations by integrals ( with @xmath68 ) @xmath69 in the continuum limit @xmath70 , and as noted earlier , the first integral diverges . to isolate this divergence we introduce a cut - off function @xmath71 which has the desired property @xmath72    from the first integral in it is clear that in the continuum ( @xmath73 ) the divergent contribution comes only from the region @xmath74 where @xmath75 and we get @xmath76 rhs of the above expression , in the limit when the cut - off parameter @xmath77 , can be approximated by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the euler - mascheroni constant .",
    "the remaining terms in the series expansion of @xmath80 in the first integral in give a finite contribution of @xmath81 while the contribution from the second integral is @xmath82 ( in evaluating these finite contributions we have put @xmath83 ) .    finally , using for @xmath84",
    ", we find the entropy to be the sum of a finite contribution and a divergent contribution @xmath85 it is interesting to note that the divergence in entropy is very slow going only as a double logarithm .",
    "using the boltzmann definition of entropy as logarithm of number of states , eq .",
    "( [ entanglement entropy in 1 + 1 continuum ] ) gives @xmath86 the above expression explicitly shows that large number of near - zero modes ( @xmath87 ) leads to the divergence of the entanglement entropy .",
    "until now , we have focused on the entanglement in @xmath88 partition as entanglement entropy can be evaluated analytically .",
    "it is straight forward to extend to a general partition @xmath89 using eq . .",
    "however , for a general partition it is no longer possible to obtain analytic results and the determinant of the covariance matrix , for instance , has to be computed numerically .",
    "figure [ entropy in 1 + 1 dim as a function of m ] shows the plot of entropy as a function of @xmath90 ( the number of oscillators traced over ) for different values of @xmath50 and it is seen to be an increasing function of @xmath90 . since entanglement entropy depends on the correlations across boundary @xcite , one would expect that only oscillators near the boundary of the traced out region would contribute which would imply that the entropy should be a constant in @xmath0 dimensions even as more and more oscillators away from the boundary get traced out . in one dimensional chains ,",
    "although this holds for weakly coupled chains as shown by plenio et.al",
    "@xcite , it breaks down in the strongly coupled systems  @xcite and the entropy grows as @xmath91 .",
    ", the area law is violated , width=302 ]     + for the critical case of @xmath73 , introducing the cut off function @xmath92 defined earlier , the entropy @xmath93 for @xmath90 oscillator reduced state gives a numerical fitting ( ignoring the terms vanishing in @xmath77 limit ) @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a constant .",
    "to investigate the effects of dimensionality on the behavior of entanglement entropy , we first consider the scalar field in @xmath96 dimensions ( discretized on a square lattice ) .",
    "the discretized version of the hamiltonian for a scalar field in @xmath96 dimensions is @xmath97 ^ 2   + \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\eta(i , j+1)-\\eta(i , j)\\right]^2 .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath98 denotes the oscillator at position labeled by @xmath99 on the two dimensional lattice and @xmath100 is the corresponding conjugate momentum",
    ". the hamiltonian can be diagonalized by going to normal coordinates and the corresponding normal mode frequencies are ( compare with eq . for @xmath0 dimensions ) @xmath101 where @xmath102 .      to explicitly see the finiteness of the determinant ,",
    "let us replace the summations in ( [ position covariance 2 + 1 dim ] , [ momentum covariance 2 + 1 dim ] ) with integrals ( with @xmath106 ) @xmath107 notice that , unlike @xmath0 dimensions , the result is finite as can easily be seen by replacing @xmath108 ( regions away from @xmath109 not contributing to the divergence ) .",
    "the entanglement entropy is given by and as in @xmath2dimensional case , it is invariant under the scaling transformations : @xmath110 and in the continuum limit , the entropy is divergent due to the uv modes .",
    "taking into account the scaling symmetry , introduce a canonical rescaling ( similar to that in @xmath111dimensions ) @xmath112 in terms of the transformed variables the hamiltonian becomes @xmath113 where @xmath114 it is important to highlight the differences between @xmath2dimensions and higher dimensions : first , unlike eqs .",
    "( [ scaling transformation ] ) , canonical transformations ( [ scaling transformation 2 + 1 dim ] ) in @xmath105 dimensions have an explicit @xmath8 dependence .",
    "this is due to the fact that the field and the canonically conjugate momentum @xmath115 have the dimensions @xmath116^{-1/2 } , [ l]^{1/2})$ ] . in the case of @xmath2 dimensions",
    "@xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) are dimensionless .",

    "this should be contrasted with the @xmath0 dimensional case where the canonical rescaling does not change the behavior of the position and momentum covariance .",

    "the only difference is that the critical value of @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the number of space dimensions .",
    "heuristically , as in the previous case , in @xmath124 limit , the last three terms in the rhs of the hamiltonian cancel giving rise to the free particle hamiltonian .",
    "this shows that there is an accumulation of near - zero modes , however , unlike the previous case the contribution is non - divergent .",
    "it is important to note that in both the cases [ @xmath2 and @xmath127dimensional space - time ] , in the continuum limit , the entanglement entropy behaves differently .",
    "one possible explanation for this difference is the following : entanglement entropy arises due to the correlations across the boundary @xcite . in @xmath0 dimensions the boundary separating the two regions is",
