    "the scientific community has been recently interested in the definition of new generalized fading models , aiming to provide a better fit to real measurements observed in different scenarios @xcite . in such context , the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath2-@xmath1 fading models @xcite have become very popular in the literature due to their versatility to accommodate to different propagation conditions and their relatively simple tractable form @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath2-@xmath1 fading models , first introduced in @xcite and @xcite , were independently derived to characterize very different propagation conditions . on the one hand , the @xmath0-@xmath1 distribution can be regarded as a generalization of the classic rician fading model for line - of - sight ( los ) scenarios , extensively used in spatially homogeneous propagation environments . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath2-@xmath1 distribution can be considered as a generalization of the classic nakagami-@xmath3 ( hoyt ) fading model for non - los scenarios , often used in non - homogeneous environments . therefore , and because they arise from different underlying physical models , there is no clear connection between the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath2-@xmath1 fading models .",
    "one of the most appealing properties of the @xmath0-@xmath1 and fading models is that they include most popular fading distributions as particular cases .",
    "for instance , the rician , nakagami-@xmath4 , rayleigh and one - sided gaussian models can be derived from the @xmath0-@xmath1 fading by setting the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 to specific real positive values .",
    "similarly , the @xmath2-@xmath1 fading model includes the nakagami-@xmath3 , nakagami-@xmath4 , rayleigh and one - sided gaussian as special cases .",
    "very recently , the @xmath0-@xmath1 shadowed fading model was introduced in @xcite , with the aim of jointly including large - scale and small - scale propagation effects .",
    "this new model exhibits excellent agreement when compared to measured land - mobile satellite @xcite , underwater acoustic @xcite and body communications fading channels @xcite , by considering that the dominant components are affected by random fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this model @xcite includes the popular rician shadowed fading distribution @xcite as a particular case , and obviously it also includes the @xmath0-@xmath1 fading distribution from which it originates .",
    "however , as we will later see , the versatility of the @xmath0-@xmath1 shadowed fading model has not been exploited to the full extent possible .    in this paper",
    "we show that the @xmath0-@xmath1 shadowed distribution unifies the set of homogeneous fading models associated with the @xmath0-@xmath1 distribution , and strikingly , it also unifies the set of non - homogeneous fading models associated with the @xmath2-@xmath1 distribution , which may seem counterintuitive at first glance .",
    "in addition to a formal mathematical proof of how the main probability functions introduced by yacoub originate from the ones derived in @xcite , we also establish new underlying physical models for the @xmath0-@xmath1 shadowed distribution that justify these phenomena .",
    "in fact , we propose a novel method to derive the nakagami-@xmath3 ( hoyt ) and the @xmath2-@xmath1 distributions which consists in using the shadowing of the dominant components to recreate a non - homogeneous propagation environment .",
    "this connection , which is here proposed for the first time in the literature , has important implications in practice : first , and contrary to the common belief , it shows that the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath2-@xmath1 fading distributions are connected .",
    "hence we can jointly study the and @xmath2-@xmath1 fading models by using a common approach instead of separately @xcite .",
    "besides , it implies that when deriving any performance metric for the @xmath0-@xmath1 shadowed fading model , we are actually solving the same problem for the simpler @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath2-@xmath1 distributions at no extra cost .",
    "leveraging our novel approach , we derive simple and closed - form asymptotic expressions for the ergodic capacity of communication systems operating under @xmath0-@xmath1 shadowed fading in the high signal - to - noise ratio regime , which can be evidently employed for the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath2-@xmath1 distributions . unlike the exact analyses in @xcite and @xcite which require the use of the meijer g- and bivariate meijer g - functions , our results allow for a better insight into the effects of the fading parameters on the capacity .",

    "in this section , we discuss the underlying physical model of the @xmath0-@xmath1 shadowed presented in @xcite .",

    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 shadowed fading is presented as the generalization of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model in @xcite .",
    "like in the @xmath0-@xmath1 fading case , the signal can be decomposed into different clusters of waves , where each cluster has scattered waves with similar delays and the delay spreads of different clusters are relatively large @xcite . in the shadowed fading , the difference appears in the dominant component of each cluster , which is no longer deterministic and can randomly fluctuate because of shadowing .",
    "in fact , when we consider that the dominant component of each cluster suffers from the same shadowing , we can express the total signal power in terms of the in - phase and the quadrature components of each cluster as @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath1 is the number of clusters ; @xmath42 and @xmath43 are independent real gaussian random variables with zero mean and variance @xmath11 , which represent the real and imaginary parts of the cluster scattering waves ; @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the powers of the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath46-th dominant component , respectively , and @xmath47 is the shadowing component which is statistically distributed as a nakagami-@xmath4 random variable with shape parameter @xmath4 and @xmath48=1 $ ] .",

    "it is worth noticing that this result can be extended for @xmath1 taking non - integer positive values @xcite , despite the model loses its physical meaning .",
    "however , this model imposes that the shadowing @xmath47 is statistically distributed as a nakagami-@xmath4 random variable , which is a strict condition that is relaxed in the next section .      the previous model in eq .",
    "( [ model_paris ] ) clearly separates each cluster in the real and imaginary power components , so that the model can be defined by only using real random variables .",
    "thus , using this time complex random variables , it can be reformulated as @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 can be related to the variables of the previous model in form of @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "hence , @xmath59 represents the scattering wave of the @xmath46-th cluster and @xmath60 is the deterministic dominant power of the @xmath46-th cluster .",
    "a straightforward generalization of the previous model is to consider a complex shadowing component , so that we obtain the following model @xmath61 where @xmath62 is now a complex random variable , with @xmath63 and arbitrary phase .",
    "this new model obviously represents a similar scenario as the previous one in section iii.a , since all the clusters suffer from the same shadowing @xmath62 , which can be justified by the fact that the shadowing can occur near the transmitter or receiver side .",

    "we propose another physical model for the @xmath0-@xmath1 shadowed distribution .",
    "when the shadowing does not occur near the transmitter or receiver sides , all the clusters could suffer from different shadowing effects , so the instantaneous received power can be expressed as @xmath71 where @xmath59 ; @xmath72 is the power of each dominant component ; and @xmath73 is a complex random variable which represents the shadowing component of the @xmath46-th cluster , where @xmath73 are i.i.d . , i.e , @xmath74 .    actually , these propagation conditions are likely to occur in real scenarios where the dominant components of different clusters could travel through different paths that are separated enough to suffer from independent large - scale propagation effects . the pdf of the instantaneous snr of the model in eq .",

    "corollary 1 is interpreted as follows : the @xmath0-@xmath1 distribution is derived by eliminating completely the shadowing of each dominant component , which can be done by taking @xmath88 , so that the dominant component of each cluster becomes deterministic .",
    "actually , as the parameter @xmath4 grows , the pdf of each dominant component is gradually compressed and , at the limit @xmath88 , it becomes a dirac delta function .",
    "thus , the model is defined by a circularly symmetric complex random variable with some non - zero mean in each cluster , so that we obtain the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , whereas in case that @xmath92 we have the rician fading model .",

    "we give the following interpretation about corollary 2 . by tending @xmath93 ,",
