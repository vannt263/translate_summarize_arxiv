    "the strangeness content of the nucleon has been under a great deal of discussions for well over a decade .",
    "a few years ago , the european muon collaboration ( emc )  @xcite measured the spin structure function of the proton in deep inelastic muon scattering and showed that there is an indication of a sizable strange quark contribution . this remarkable result has been confirmed by following experiments of the spin muon collaboration ( smc )  @xcite , e142 and e143 collaborations  @xcite .",
    "another experiment conducted at brookhaven  @xcite ( bnl experiment 734 ) measuring the low - energy elastic neutrino - proton scattering came to the more or less same conclusion .",
    "kaplan and manohar  @xcite showed how elastic @xmath6 and @xmath7 scatterings can be used to extract not only the @xmath8 form factors of the @xmath9 current but also the @xmath10 form factors of the baryon number current and furthermore how the strange quark matrix elements @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be evaluated . following these suggestions , garvey _ et al .",

    ". however , these form factors are experimentally unknown to date and have no stringent and concrete constraints on their @xmath16dependence yet .",
    "there are various proposals and experiments in progress ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "all these considerations lead to the conclusion that , in contrast to the naive quark model , it is of great importance to consider strange quarks in the nucleon seriously .",
    "there have been several theoretical efforts to describe the strange form factors of the nucleon .",
    "the first attempt was performed by jaffe  @xcite .",
    "jaffe took advantage of ref .",
    "@xcite , _ i.e. _ the pole fit analysis based on dispersion theory , and estimated the mean - square strange radius and magnetic moment of the nucleon:@xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "more recently , hammer _ et al . _",
    "@xcite updated jaffe s pole - fit analysis of the strange vector form factors , relying upon a new dispersion theoretic analysis of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors .",
    "in fact , hammer _ et al .",
    "_ improved jaffe s prediction , giving @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "a noticeable point of the pole - fit analysis is that it has the different sign of the strange electric radius , compared with almost other models .",
    "another interesting approach is the kaon - loop calculation .",
    "the main idea of the kaon - loop calculation is that the strangeness content of the nucleon exists as a pair of @xmath25 or @xmath26 components .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite first evaluated @xmath27 and @xmath28 , considering the possible kaon loops relevant for the strange vector form factors .",
    "however , ref .",
    "@xcite failed to include _ seagull _ terms which are essential to satisfy the ward - takahashi identity in the vector current sector .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite added these seagull terms and obtained @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the prediction of @xmath28 in the kaon - loop calculation is found to be much smaller than the pole - fit analysis . to reconcile the conflict between the pole - fit analysis and the kaon - loop calculation , refs .",

    "the value of @xmath28 in ref .",
    "@xcite appeared to be larger than that of the kaon - loop calculation but still conspicuously smaller than that of the pole - fit analysis : @xmath32 .",
    "@xcite evaluated also the strange vector form factors and discussed to a great extent several different theoretical estimates .",
    "the su(3 ) skyrme model with pseudoscalar mesons  @xcite and with vector mesons  @xcite estimated , respectively , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "most recently , leinweber obtained @xmath37 which appears to be much larger than other models .    in this paper , we aim at investigating the strange vector form factors and related strange observables in the su(3 ) chiral quark - soliton model ( @xmath38qsm ) , often called semi - bosonized su(3 ) nambu - jona - lasinio model ( njl ) .",
    "the model is based on the interaction of quarks with goldstone bosons and has been shown to be quite successful in reproducing static properties of the baryons such as mass splitting  @xcite , axial constants  @xcite and magnetic moments  @xcite and their form factors  @xcite . in a recent review  @xcite , one can easily see how well the model describe the baryonic observables .",
    "in particular , since the strange vector form factors are deeply related to the electromagnetic form factors  @xcite being well described in @xmath38qsm , it is quite interesting to study them in the same framework .",
    "the strangeness content of the nucleon can be interpreted in terms of the @xmath39- and @xmath40-components  @xcite .",
    "it implies that one need incorporate the kaonic cloud properly in order to calculate the strange vector form factor .",
    "in fact , the strange electric charge radius in a hedgehog model is proportional to the inverse of the kaon mass , which means that it is very sensitive to the tail of the kaonic cloud .",
    "hence , it is of great significance to take care that the kaonic cloud has a proper yukawa asymptotics in order to evaluate the strange vector form factors rightly . in this respect",
    "the present paper provides a clear improvement over the results of ref .",
    "@xcite . in a recent study on the kaonic effect on the neutron electric form factor  @xcite",
    ", it was shown that even the calculation of the neutron electric form factor requires a proper kaon tail .",
    "in the same spirit , we expect that the kaonic cloud will have a decisive effect on the strange vector form factors .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : section ii sketches the general formalism for obtaining the strange vector form factors in the framework of @xmath38qsm .",

    "those are obtained by the semiclassical quantization procedure , described below in the context of the strange form factors .",
    "the information of the strange vector form factors in the nucleon is contained in the quark matrix elements as follows : @xmath75 the strange dirac form factors of the nucleon are defined by the matrix elements of the @xmath76 : @xmath77 u_n ( p),\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the square of the four momentum transfer @xmath79 with @xmath80 .",

    "6 shows that the @xmath3 corrections has a small effect on the @xmath172 .",
    "it is very different from what we saw in the case of the @xmath172 .",
