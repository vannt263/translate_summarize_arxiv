    "perfect state transfer in more general networks has also been considered and some interesting results for complete graphs were obtained in  @xcite .    nonetheless , the information - theoretic properties of spin networks are not fully understood .",
    "information encoded in excitations of a network of coupled spins propagates , even under ideal conditions when quantum coherence is maintained , in a non - classical way determined by the schrdinger equation . under best possible circumstances , this propagation of excitations determines the information transfer fidelity ( itf ) between various nodes of the network .",
    "perfect state transfer between two nodes can only be achieved when the information transfer fidelity between the respective nodes is unity .",
    "however , this condition is not sufficient .",
    "for example , while it is satisfied for the end nodes of a chain with uniform couplings  @xcite such chains are usually _ not _ considered to admit perfect state transfer except for chains of length two or three .",
    "this raises the question of the attainability of the upper bound given by the information transfer fidelity .",
    "attainability in general also depends on time constraints , i.e. , attainable in what time , and the margins of errors we are willing to accept . in practice , some margin of error is unavoidable , and the real question of interest is therefore not whether we can achieve , e.g. , _ perfect _ ,",
    "i.e. , unit fidelity , state transfer in time @xmath0 , but rather whether we can achieve state transfer with a fidelity @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is an acceptable margin of error , in a reasonable amount of time .",
    "we may be willing to accept a slightly increased margin of error for a significant reduction in the transfer time . in this work ,",
    "we are interested in such fundamental questions for spin networks subject to coherent dynamics in general , and specifically simple configurations such as a circular arrangement of spins ( or spin ring for short ) , which could serve as basic building blocks for more complex architectures .    after introducing some basic definitions and basic results in section [ s : basic_def_results ] ,",
    "the concept of asymptotic itf , i.e. , maximum information transfer fidelity attainable absent constraints on the transfer times , between nodes in a network of spins is introduced in section [ s : attainability ]",
    ". conditions for attainability of the bounds are derived using dynamic flows on tori and the simultaneous diophantine approximation , computationally implemented using the lenstra - lenstra - lovsz ( lll ) algorithm . under certain conditions ,",
    "the information transfer infidelity induces a metric that captures how close two nodes in a spin network are from an information theoretic point of view .",
    "this information transfer geometry is investigated in section [ s : geometry ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ s : control ] , we investigate how the information transfer geometry of a network can be changed by means of simple controls in the form of fixed biases applied to individual nodes , and how this principle could be employed for dynamic routing in a spin network with ring topology without the requirement of fast - switching controls .",

    "hence , in the limit @xmath547 , we expect the transition fidelities for the first @xmath46 nodes to approach those for a chain of length @xmath46 while the transition fidelities between the first @xmath46 nodes and the final ( biased ) node approach @xmath45 .",
    "we now reformulate this intuitively obvious result in precise mathematical language .",
    "[ l : toeplitz ] the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the @xmath548 toeplitz matrix @xmath549 made up of ones on the super diagonal and subdiagonal and zeros everywhere else are given by @xmath550 and @xmath551 ; @xmath552 , @xmath553 . furthermore , for @xmath44 even , @xmath554 .",

    "then @xmath557    write the characteristic polynomial of @xmath558 as @xmath559 and recall that the determinant of the sum of two matrices equals the sums of the determinants of all matrices made up with some columns of one matrix and the complementary columns of the other matrix . applying the latter to the characteristic polynomial of @xmath560 yields @xmath561 where @xmath549 is the toeplitz matrix defined in the lemma . from classical root - locus techniques , it follows that , as @xmath562 , _ exactly one _",
    "eigenvalue @xmath563 goes to @xmath564 , while the remaining ones @xmath565 converge to the roots of @xmath566 .",
    "next , we look at the eigenvectors and rewrite the eigenvector equation as @xmath567 consider first the first @xmath568 equations .",
    "since @xmath569 exists and is finite , it follows from the bottom eigenequation that @xmath570 remains bounded as @xmath571",

    "unique _ eigenvalue of @xmath549 , it follows that @xmath574 is the corresponding eigenvector of @xmath549 .",
    "it remains to show that with this @xmath575 the bottom eigenequation can be made to hold .",
    "this is easily achieved by defining @xmath576 by the lemma , for @xmath44 even , we have @xmath577 , and therefore the @xmath578 eigenequation holds with @xmath579 going to zero faster than @xmath580 . for @xmath44 odd , @xmath579 goes to zero as @xmath581 , where @xmath582 is some constant .    by the root locus result , for @xmath540 large enough , all eigenvalues are distinct , and we have @xmath583 where the second equality is understood as the @xmath571 limit . to complete the proof , it therefore remains to look at @xmath584 .",

    "thus we have a systematic way to compute the asymptotic transfer probability of a ring with high bias from the transfer probability of a chain without bias .    as an illustration of how these results can be used ,",
    "consider a ring of size @xmath201 .",
    "the maximum transfer fidelities between nodes @xmath589 for this ring without bias are quite low , @xmath590 and @xmath591 .",
    "however , applying a large bias to node @xmath592 changes the maximum transfer fidelities . in particular , the maximum transfer fidelity between nodes @xmath23 and @xmath593 , @xmath128 and @xmath594 , @xmath595 and @xmath596 , and @xmath59 and @xmath328 , now approaches @xmath23 .",
    "[ f : checker89 ] shows a visual representation of the transfer fidelities for the ring without bias ( left ) and with bias ( right ) .",
    "this result is consistent with theorem  [ t : tricky_limit ] , as using lemma  [ l : toeplitz ] , it is easily verified that @xmath597 the example also shows that a finite bias is sufficient to enable almost perfect state transfer in practice , despite the fact that the ring only becomes a chain in the limit when an infinite bias is applied to node @xmath592 .",
    "we also used the lll - inspired algorithm to estimate the transfer time as a function of the infidelity of the transfer .",
    "we note here that it was crucial to use the weighted lll algorithm to generate a range of simultaneous diophantine approximations , which generally did _ not _ satisfy the parity constraints on the numerators , and to use the idea of combining approximations to satisfy the constraints . with this approach",
    "we were able to find solutions satisfying all of the parity constraints on the numerators over a wide range of infidelities to estimate the transfer times required as a function of the tolerated infidelity .",
    "the results , shown in fig .  [ f : ring9-bias10-scaling ] ( left ) suggest that high fidelities are indeed attainable for modest biases , and the apparent linearity of the data in the bilogarithmic plot still suggests a polynomial scaling",
    ". however , the actual transfer times are significantly higher in this case than in previous examples .",
    "we point out here that our algorithm is not guaranteed to find the shortest possible time although fig .  [",
    "f : ring9-bias10-scaling ] ( right ) suggests that there is a good correlation between the diophantine approximation error and the observed infidelity of the transfer .",
    "furthermore , the algorithm enables us to estimate necessary transfer times far beyond the regime accessible by brute - force numerical simulations .",
    "this example shows how a dynamic routing scheme can be implemented to transfer information from any node in a ring to any other node with fidelity approaching unity by simply applying bias fields to different nodes . for transfer between nodes @xmath23 and @xmath593 , @xmath128 and @xmath594 , @xmath595 and @xmath596 , or @xmath59 and @xmath328 , it suffices to apply a large bias to node @xmath592 .",
    "if we wish to transfer information from node @xmath23 to @xmath59 then translation invariance of the ring allows us to shift the labels by @xmath128 , so that node @xmath23 becomes @xmath595 and @xmath59 becomes @xmath596 , and applying a bias to the new node @xmath592 will enable the transfer .",
    "further reflection shows that we can achieve maximum transfer fidelities approaching unity for transfer between any pair of nodes in a ring of size @xmath3 provided @xmath3 is odd by simply biasing the node in the middle between the pair of spins .",
    "this is because in this case @xmath598 is odd , so there must be an odd number of spins along one path around the ring and an even number between the spins around the other . by applying the bias in the middle of the path with an odd number of spins",
    "we asymptotically reach a chain with @xmath46 ( even ) spins . in this chain",
    "the transfer probability between spins mirrored at the center is @xmath23 , which is specifically true for the source and target spin with an even number of spins between them in the chain .    if @xmath3 is even instead , then the situation is more complicated .",
    "if there is an odd number of spins between source and target along the ring , then applying a bias at the middle creates an odd chain where source and target are connected with probability @xmath23 as they are at mirror - symmetric positions in the ring .",
    "if there is an even number of spins between source and target , then applying a single bias can not achieve perfect information transfer as the spins can never be at mirrored positions in the odd chain ( which are the only ones in the chain perfectly connected ) .",
    "there are , however , multiple solutions to apply a bias at two spins that can asymptotically generate a suitable chain .    in practice it may be possible and even preferable to simultaneously apply biases to several nodes instead of a single node to shape the overall potential landscape .",
    "this case is more difficult to treat analytically but preliminary results  @xcite suggest that numerical optimization can be used in this case to optimize the applied biases to achieve significant reductions in the transfer times and the magnitude of the required bias fields , as well as to deal with practical issues such as leakage of the bias fields , i.e. , the tendency of a bias applied to one node to also affect nearby nodes .     +    , @xmath599 , @xmath600 and @xmath601 for a ring of size @xmath201 with a bias of strength @xmath602 ( in units of @xmath387 ) applied to node @xmath603 ( left ) and correlation of fidelity error ( or infidelity ) and diophantine approximation error ( right).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ] , @xmath599 , @xmath600 and @xmath601 for a ring of size @xmath201 with a bias of strength @xmath602 ( in units of @xmath387 ) applied to node @xmath603 ( left ) and correlation of fidelity error ( or infidelity ) and diophantine approximation error ( right).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "the concept of maximum transfer fidelity for information transfer between nodes in a network of interacting spins was introduced and criteria for attainability of the bounds in terms of the transition frequencies of the network were given .",
    "attainability was shown to be related , theoretically , to minimality of a linear flow and , computationally , to a translation on a torus .",
    "this last connection enabled us to derive upper bounds on the time required to realize transfer fidelities within @xmath604 of the maximum transfer fidelity , for arbitrary @xmath605 , via the simultaneous diophantine approximation .",
    "algorithms were discussed to find the required approximations .",
    "the ultimate aim of this analysis is to understand the intrinsic limitations of information transfer in spin networks and utilize this understanding to engineer networks with favorable bounds on the information transfer fidelities and dynamic attainability properties , so that high spin transfer fidelities can be attained in short times , enabling fast transfer and minimizing the effects of noise and decoherence .",
    "an advantage of our approach of combining general itf bounds and asymptotic attainability conditions with an algorithm to estimate the time required to achieve transfer within a set margin of error , compared to engineering the spectrum of the network hamiltonian to admit perfect state transfer , for example , is that the latter condition is generally too strong a requirement , as in practice there are always margins of error .",
    "therefore it makes more sense to ask how much time is required to achieve a certain transfer fidelity for a given acceptable margin of error @xmath2 , and try to optimize the network topology , couplings or biases to achieve the best possible transfer times for the acceptable margins of error .",
    "the general results were applied specifically to regular spin structures such as rings with uniform coupling . in this case",
    ", the information transfer infidelity prametric induced by maximum transfer fidelity takes on full significance as it can be shown to be a proper metric defining an information transfer infidelity geometry for the network , which is significantly different from the physical network geometry .",
    "the analysis shows that the intrinsic transfer fidelities for simple networks such as rings are often attainable asymptotically but the times required to achieve high fidelities can be very long .",
    "the intrinsic bounds on the itfs and transfer times can be favorably changed , however , by simple hamiltonian engineering such as applying spatially distributed static bias fields . in particular , it was shown how such simple controls can be used to alter the information transfer fidelities and geometry of a network .",
    "it was demonstrated how this idea can be applied to enable or disable information transfer between a pair of nodes in the network .",
    "simple bias controls are sufficient to direct information flow between nodes . by changing the biases different transfers can be targeted , and thus a spin ring with fixed couplings can be turned into a simple quantum router for information encoded in excitations of a spin network .",
    "directions for future work include optimizing information transfer in spin networks via optimal control to achieve faster and more efficient dynamic routing in more complex spin networks .",
    "while this work focused on transfer of a single excitation , the concepts and analysis can also be applied to the case of encoding and simultaneous transfer of multiple excitations .",
    "this is interesting as it could increase the information transmission capacity of the network . finally ,",
    "although simulation results for similar spin systems suggest that some degree of intrinsic robustness of state transfer and the ability to mitigate the effects of noise , decoherence or fluctuations in the couplings via control  @xcite , the sensitivity of transfer fidelities with regard to noise and deleterious effect of the environment need to be investigated for specific physical realizations of spin networks .",
