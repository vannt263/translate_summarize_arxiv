    "another powerful method of understanding the shape of simple fermi surfaces is angle - dependent magnetoresistance oscillations ( amro ) , which allow access to the fermi surface at much higher temperatures and scattering rates than the purely quantum oscillation effects .",
    "this method has been employed successfully to map both quasi - one dimensional ( q1d ) and quasi - two dimensional ( q2d ) fermi surfaces , as in bedt - ttf organic salts @xcite , intercalated graphite compounds @xcite , ruthenates @xcite , and superconducting pnictides @xcite and cuprates @xcite .",
    "many electronic systems with hexagonal symmetry possess interesting transport properties , such as unusual anisotropy in electronic scattering , charge - density waves phenomena and backscattering protected transport on the surface of topological insulators .",
    "pdcoo@xmath0 is one such interesting material , belonging to a more general family of delafossite compounds , which has been found to have extremely large magnetoresistance @xcite and unusual transport properties @xcite , with strong transport anisotropy between the in - plane and out - of - plane directions , which differ by a factor of up to 200 @xcite .",
    "recent experimental angle - dependent studies show very strong features in the magnetoresistance of pdcoo@xmath0 , both when the magnetic field is rotated in the conductive plane @xcite as well as out - of - plane @xcite .",
    "furthermore , quantum oscillations show that the data can be modelled using a single corrugated hexagonal fermi surface @xcite .",
    "in this work , we use the boltzmann equation@xcite to calculate the angle dependent magnetotransport properties for electronic systems with hexagonal symmetry , which have not been explored before . starting from a tight - binding description of the fermi surface on a hexagonal lattice , we investigate the angle dependent magnetoresistance when the magnetic field is rotated , either in the conducting plane or out - of - plane , focusing in particular on the role of scattering and the degree of warping of the fermi surface .",
    "we find that the form of the magnetoresistance depends strongly on the degree of warping , with additional features emerging at high warping levels .",
    "our work provides a large range of parameters that can be used to compare with future experimental studies for materials with a single quasi - two dimensional hexagonal fermi surface , such as pdcoo@xmath0 and ptcoo@xmath0 .",
    "in order to investigate analytically a single fermi surface on a hexagonal lattice we used a tight - binding approach to expand a quasi - two dimensional fermi surface using cylindrical harmonics , as considered in previous studies @xcite :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the spacing between conducting layers and @xmath4 is the azimuthal angle in the cylindrical co - ordinate system used . @xmath5 $ ] .",

    "these operations are discussed in more detail in appendix j. taking all these constraints and assuming that near - neighbour hopping dominates by ignoring higher order terms of the expansion @xcite , we are left with the expression : @xmath18 fig.[fig : coefficientsfs ] shows this for different values of the coefficients .",

    "physically , the @xmath20 and @xmath21 terms are related to interlayer anisotropy of the fermi surface , whilst the other terms are related to in - plane anisotropy .",
    "the effect of each of these anisotropic terms on the shape of the fermi surface is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coefficientsfs ] , where @xmath22 introduces a 6-fold symmetry whilst @xmath23 introduces a 12-fold symmetry , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 terms introduce warping in the @xmath24-direction . in this",
    "work @xmath21 will be used as a variable to investigate the effect of fs warping on amro and the values of the parameters are chosen to be @xmath25 and @xmath26  ( in units of @xmath27 ) taken to match closely the experimental values for pdcoo@xmath0 , as determined from quantum oscillations @xcite .",
    "we choose @xmath21 as our variable parameter because we expect it will give a rich structure to the resulting amro - as we are calculating the @xmath28-axis resistivity , we would expect terms containing @xmath24 dependence to have the largest effect on the amro . using @xmath21 as a variable allows us to explore a range of plausible amro resulting from warped pdcoo@xmath0-like fermi surfaces , whereas using other parameters from the expansion would affect the amro in a more subtle way .",
    "these parameters can be directly related to the transfer integrals in a usual tight - binding model as detailed in refs . and discussed in appendix i. however , when directly inferring the tight - binding overlap integrals from quantum oscillation experiments there are certain limitations - the bare electronic bandwidth is inaccessible by these experiments , and only the states near the fermi surface are probed , meaning one can determine the fermi surface geometry and the renormalized bandwidth .",
    "the energy bands and the transfer integrals lose their meaning away from the fermi surface in a strongly interacting system .",
    "thus , the use of a cylindrical harmonic expansion allows us to parametrize the fermi surface geometry directly from the electronic structure information obtained from experimental data , in particular when comparing quantum oscillations and amro data .    in order to numerically calculate the amro , for fields both in and out of the ( @xmath29)-plane",

    "the amro features are captured qualitatively by the isotropic calculations , with differences starting to emerge at large @xmath38 angles @xcite .",
    "this implies that we can draw valid conclusions from calculations that do not include anisotropy in the scattering time or effective mass .",
    "this conclusion is also justified by experiments on pdcoo@xmath0 up to @xmath39  k , which are described by a single isotropic scattering rate @xcite , implying that impurity scattering is the dominant process in the regime in which amro are observed . in general , anisotropy in the effective mass , and thus the cyclotron frequency @xmath40 , arises via the expression @xmath41 , where @xmath42 points along the cylindrical radial direction @xcite .",
    "anisotropy arises if the two vectors are not parallel . from the results shown in appendix e ,",
    "the angle between @xmath42 and @xmath43 will be @xmath44 , and thus the dot product will be proportional to the cosine of this quantity . as the argument of the inverse tangent is small , we can expand the cosine as @xmath45 , meaning the anisotropy in @xmath46 and @xmath40 is small , and will be a second order effect at best , justifying its neglect .",
    "anisotropies in the scattering time or effective mass may introduce important quantitative corrections to our results @xcite , but this is beyond the scope of the current work .",
    "the oscillations in amro are semi - classical in nature , and are due to the formation of cyclotron orbits on the fs and the changing area enclosed by them @xcite .",
    "amro can be calculated from a linearised boltzmann transport equation @xcite , which is derived in full in appendix a. in order to calculate the magnetoresistance and thus observe amro , we must derive an expression for the conductivity tensor for the fs given by eq . .",
    "we used the boltzmann equation : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the particle distribution in the absence of fields or temperature gradients , @xmath49 is the difference between the steady state distribution and @xmath48 ( assumed to be small ) , @xmath50 is the velocity of the particles and @xmath36 is the scattering time .",
    "solving this equation and using it to calculate the conductivity produces the shockley - chambers tube integral@xcite : @xmath51 this is derived in detail , in the case of closed orbits only , in the appendices .    a generalised version of the shockley - chambers tube integral that includes the effect of open orbits is @xcite @xmath52 the time integral integrates over the history of the open orbit .",
    "here we consider two cases : when the magnetic field is within the @xmath53-plane ( @xmath54 ) and the contribution from the open orbits is dominant , or when the field is away from the @xmath53-plane ( @xmath55 ) and the closed orbits dominate .",
