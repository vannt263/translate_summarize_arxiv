    "<S> the cluster abundances are calculated from a quantum statistical approach taking into account in - medium corrections . for arbitrary cluster size </S>",
    "<S> the self - energy and pauli blocking shifts are considered . </S>",
    "<S> exploratory calculations are performed for symmetric matter at temperature @xmath0 mev and baryon density @xmath1 @xmath2 to be compared with the solar element distribution . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the abundances of weakly bound nuclei with mass number @xmath3 are strongly suppressed due to pauli blocking effects .    the investigation of thermodynamic properties of hot nuclear matter for parameter values temperature @xmath4 mev , baryon density @xmath5 @xmath2 is recently of interest with respect to astrophysical and cosmological questions as well as the investigation of heavy ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the problem of the calculation of abundances of clusters @xmath6 ( nuclei with mass number @xmath7 , excitation state @xmath8 and center of mass momentum @xmath9 ) within a systematic quantum statistical approach is of relevance for the equation of state ( eos ) and the thermodynamic properties </S>",
    "<S> . we will not give here an exhaustive review of the quantum statistical treatment of hot nuclear matter , see @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we give only some details and results in calculating the cluster abundances , in particular the treatment of heavier clusters at low densities .    </S>",
    "<S> we start from a cluster decomposition of the eos obtained from a self - consistent ladder hartree - fock approximation for the self - energy : @xmath10^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 denotes the contribution of clusters @xmath7 to the total baryon density , @xmath12 is the degeneration factor of the state @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy eigenvalue @xmath13 of the cluster @xmath6 is obtained from a bethe - goldstone equation that takes into account the influence of the surrounding matter on the quantum state of the considered cluster . in ladder hartree - fock approximation </S>",
    "<S> it can be decomposed as follows : @xmath14 where @xmath15 describes the dependence of the energy of the cluster because of the coulomb interaction with the surrounding charged particles , @xmath16 is the self - energy shift , and @xmath17 denotes the shift due to phase space occupation ( pauli blocking ) . </S>",
    "<S> the summation in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 1 ] ) concerns only the bound states . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the condition @xmath18 holds , since the lower edge of the continuum of scattering states for each of the a cluster constituents is shifted by the single particle self - energy shift @xmath19 at momentum @xmath20 . above the so - called mott density introduced in @xcite , the bound state merges in the continuum of scattering states and disappears . </S>",
    "<S> the condition ( [ 3 ] ) excludes the interval @xmath21 for the integral over @xmath9 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 1 ] ) if the density exceeds the mott density .    to evaluate the eos ( [ 1 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> we have to determine the energies @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> we give some details considering as example the parameter values @xmath23 mev and @xmath24 @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the ladder - hartree fock approximation and the approximation for the evaluation of the pauli shift given below that the surrounding of the cluster under consideration is described as a nondegenerated , uncorrelated gas of nucleons , we assume symmetric nuclear matter where protons and neutrons are considered as particles interacting in the same manner . within the exploratory model calculations given here for symmetric matter , we make the approximation that we attribute to a system of @xmath7 nucleons the charge @xmath25 , this means , each nucleon ( mass @xmath26 ) has the charge @xmath27 . for symmetric matter , we have only one chemical potential @xmath28 , for asymmetric matter see @xcite where the two - component case is treated . </S>",
    "<S> further assumptions refer to empirical quantities ( radii of nuclei , density distribution within a cluster , single - particle hartree - fock shift , density of states of excited nuclei , and so on ) that can be improved in a systematic way . </S>",
    "<S> our main interest is the calculation of the energy shift of heavier elements , in particular @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> the relevance of coulomb interaction is increasing with increasing cluster size @xmath7 and leads to two effects : the nucleon density near a cluster is reduced due to the debye - thomas - fermi theory of screening of a charge distribution by the surrounding plasma , whereas the density of the strongly degenerated electrons ( as compensating background ) remains nearly constant . at the surface of the cluster @xmath7 , given by the radius @xmath29 with @xmath30 fm </S>",
    "<S> , we have the density @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the energy of a cluster is shifted to the value @xmath32 due to the screening of the coulomb potential .    </S>",
    "<S> the screening radius @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 where the value @xmath28 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 4 ] ) is obtained from the relation for the ideal fermi gas ( @xmath35 ) @xmath36 for the parameter set given above , @xmath37 results . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite where for @xmath41 the value of the empirical binding energy for the most abundant isobar is taken ; the dependence of the energy @xmath32 from the center of mass momentum @xmath9 has been neglected .    for the parameter values considered here , the values @xmath42 for @xmath43 exceeds the mott density so that for these cluster the value @xmath44 has to be determined where the cluster breaks up into free nucleons or smaller clusters ( with energies shifted according to the density @xmath45 , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 6 ] ) , as shown below ) . </S>",
    "<S> this way , the interval of values @xmath9 for that the cluster can exist , is reduced .    the single - particle self - energy shift @xmath46 can be determined from a skyrme interaction with zero range so that it is not dependent of temperature and momentum . according to @xcite we have ( units mev , fm ) @xmath47 for light clusters @xmath48 , </S>",
