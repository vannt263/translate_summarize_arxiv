    "if the energy transferred in collisions is higher than a displacement threshold energy , @xmath0 , the atoms leave their site and start moving . during its movement , a pka is slowed - down by interactions with other atoms , which are called `` secondary knock - on atoms '' ( skas ) .",

    "the goal of this article is to estimate the radiation damage of the positron source target by multi - mev photons generated in a helical undulator .",
    "the photons are generated by the radiation of relativistic electrons passing through the periodic , helical magnetic field of the undulator .",
    "the undulator is installed part way along main electron linac , in a chicane arrangement , where the electron energy has reached 150  gev .",
    "positrons are produced from multi - mev photons by means of pair production in the field of a nucleus in a conversion target .",
    "when a nucleus is excited by photons at energies of giant resonances , one or more nucleons may knocked out .",
    "these secondary particles collide with lattice atoms and induce damage of the target .",
    "the generation of secondary particles by a photon beam has been calculated using fluka  @xcite .",
    "a major advantage of fluka is its capability to calculate electromagnetic showers in matter as well as neutron fluxes and atomic recoil effects .",

    "the required photon beam power has been derived from the positron production in the ti6al4v target ( 90% of ti , 6% of al and 4% of v ) with a thickness of 0.4 radiation length and taking into account positron beam losses after the target .",
    "the positron yield defined as ratio of number of positrons emerging from the target and number of photons hitting the target is @xmath9 .",
    "almost 28% of the positrons are captured , accelerated and match the acceptance of the dumping ring .",

    "these results are quantitative only , because the `` damage area '' used for the estimations has been defined by the size of the photon beam .",
    "this area has been frozen after the first inelastic photon - nucleus interaction and does not include the real displacement cascade development .",
    "the reason for such essential simplification was the inability of fluka to transport recoil atoms .",
    "hence , the results shown in figure [ fig : dpa - vs - xy ] could be used only for relative comparisons .",
