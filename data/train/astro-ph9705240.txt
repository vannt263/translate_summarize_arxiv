    "the working definition of associated ( ) absorption lines in qso spectra is that they appear within several thousand  of the emission - line redshift and have profile widths of less than a few hundred   ( @xcite ) .",
    "these systems are known statistically to comprise an independent class of absorber ( @xcite ) , but their nature is generally uncertain .",
    "the relatively narrow line profiles distinguish  features from the well - known broad absorption lines ( bals ) that appear in 10% to 15% of qso spectra ( @xcite ) . however , there are also transitional absorbers , with intermediate line widths and sometimes high bal - like velocities , that reveal a wide range of absorption properties between the extremes represented by bals and the classic  systems ( @xcite , and @xcite , 1997b and 1997c )",
    ". bals and transitional `` mini - bals '' clearly form in qso outflows with velocities that sometimes exceed 0.1c ( see also turnshek 1988 ) .",
    "the classic  systems can have a variety of origins ( @xcite ) .",
    "a few  absorbers are now known to be `` intrinsic '' to the qso ( forming near the qso engine ) based on ( 1 ) line strength variabilities , ( 2 ) multiplet ratios that imply partial line - of - sight coverage of the background emission source(s ) , or less conclusively , ( 3 ) smooth and relatively broad line profiles when observed at spectral resolutions close to the thermal speeds ( @xcite ) .",
    "the known intrinsic  systems also originate in qso ejecta ; they are blueshifted with respect to the emission lines and probably form within at least a few tens of pc of the central engine .",
    "recent studies showing typically high metallicities in  systems ( @xcite ) , consistent with the metallicities derived from other clearly intrinsic features like the bals and the broad emission lines ( @xcite ) , suggest that _ most _  lines have an intrinsic origin .",
    "similarly , the higher incidence of  lines in radio - loud vs. radio - quiet qsos , and the further correlation between  occurrance and radio properties such as the spectral index and the core / lobe flux ratio , also argue for a frequent intrinsic origin ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , particular  systems could still form far from the qsos , for example in the qso s own host galaxy ( e.g. in the galactic halo ) or in other galaxies along our line - of - sight .",
    "the finding that radio - loud quasars have more nearby galaxies than radio - quiet qsos ( @xcite ) , in addition to being more likely to have  lines ( @xcite ) , has fueled speculation that neighboring galaxies ( e.g. in the same galaxy cluster ) often cause  absorption .",
    "some studies have placed upper limits on the absorber gas densities that require distances not less that a few tens to a few hundred kpc from the qso ( @xcite ) .",
    "we will call all of these non - intrinsic systems `` intervening '' because they are probably similar ( or identical ) to the well - studied metal - line systems that appear far from the qso redshifts ( i.e. at ; @xcite ) .",
    "pks  2135@xmath1147 ( phl  1657 ) is a radio - loud qso with an emission - line redshift of @xmath0 and strong  absorption lines that were first measured in , and with the _ international ultraviolet explorer _",
    "( _ iue _ ; @xcite ) .",
    "the absorber is the lowest redshift  system known among qsos and , as such , could help us understand the possible relationship between the  systems in high - redshift qsos and similar features in low - redshift seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "pks  2135@xmath1147 is also interesting because the qso lies near the center of a small cluster of galaxies ( @xcite ) and is surrounded by diffuse emission due to its own host galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "redshifts published for the qso ( @xcite ) , its host galaxy and several nearby galaxies ( @xcite ) are all similar to the  redshift measured by _",

    "the compact object a lies well within the host galaxy defined by this diffuse luminosity and could be a secondary nucleus ( @xcite ) .",

    "table 1 lists coordinates for all the bright sources in figure 1 as determined by us from the flux centroids .",
    "the maximum ( 3@xmath11 ) errors in the relative positions should be @xmath120.1  unless noted otherwise in the table .",
    "the errors in the absolute positions could be as large as 1.5  ( according to the _ wfpc2 _ instrument handbook , version 3.0 ) ; however , there is good agreement between the quasar coordinates in table 1 and the radio core position ( see table legend ) .",
    "the redshift of pks  2135@xmath1147 shown in figure 1 ( also table 1 ) was measured by us from the narrow emission lines in the qso spectrum ( see  2.2.1 below ) .",

    "the total usable exposure times were 40 min with g130h and 36 min with g190h .",
    "the spectra were calibrated by the _ space telescope science institute _ using their standard `` pipeline '' procedures immediately after the observations .",
    "those calibrations have wavelength uncertainties up to a few   .",
    "we corrected the wavelengths in the g130h spectrum by applying a uniform shift of @xmath10.15   , so that the galactic absorption line  @xmath191260 is at its laboratory wavelength in the measured spectrum .",
    "this shift is consistent with the centroid of the much broader ( and less accurately measured ) geocoronal  line ( 1215.67   ) .",
    "we corrected the g190h wavelengths by simultaneously requiring that ( 1 ) the one - component fits to the  absorption lines in have roughly the same redshift as in the wavelength - corrected g130h spectrum (  2.1.1 below ) , and ( 2 ) the narrow core of the he  ii  @xmath191640 emission line has a redshift consistent with he  ii  @xmath194686 and the other narrow emission lines in the lick spectrum (  2.2.1 below ) .",

    "the uncertainties in the wavelengths and redshifts listed in table 3 reflect only the photon counting statistics .",
    "the 1@xmath11 uncertainties in the wavelength calibration are an additional @xmath30.1   .",

    "the best one - component fits to the  lines have redshifts that are larger than the qso s forbidden - line redshift by about 150   ( compare table 2 and 3 ) .",
    "this difference is small compared to the absorption - line fwhms , which range from roughly 350 to 550  .",
    "a gaussian deconvolution of these fwhms indicates line - of - sight velocity dispersions of 270 to 450  . in the best two - components fits to  and ,",
    "the individual absorption features are separated by @xmath3325   and straddle the qso s forbidden - line redshift .",
    "the redshift separation between these absorption components also encompasses the redshifts of companion a and the cluster galaxies 13 in figure 1 .",
    "the redshifts alone , therefore , fail to identify the absorber .",
    "nonetheless , the small velocity shift between the qso and the  gas could mean that the absorber is essentially at rest ( @xmath4200  ) with respect to the qso and therefore outside the deep gravitational potential of the qso and its host - galaxy nucleus , at least a kpc away .",
    "however , absorption much nearer the qso can not be ruled out .",
    "the true space velocities might be much larger if they are dominated by rotation or infall / outflow that is mostly perpendicular to our line - of - sight to the qso .",
    "for example , in the models of qso outflows driven off of accretion disks ( @xcite ) , the gas velocities near the disk are dominated by rotation plus a small vertical component ( perpendicular to the disk plane ) .",
    "absorption lines measured along sightlines that graze the accretion disk might therefore have small line - of - sight velocities , even though the gas is participating in a high - velocity wind very near the qso .",
    "the projected distances of the cluster objects from pks  2135@xmath1147 are 4.0@xmath6 kpc for object a and 12@xmath6 , 36@xmath6 and 90@xmath6 kpc for galaxies 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "studies of low - redshift intervening ( ) systems show that luminous ( @xmath3@xmath5 ) galaxies like those near pks  2135@xmath1147 can cause absorption lines with rew  @xmath32    if they are close enough to our sightline to the qso . in the survey by lanzetta ( 1995 ) , 2 of 4 galaxies at projected distances @xmath3342@xmath6  kpc but none at larger distances produced strong ( rew  @xmath32   ) absorption .",
    "similarly , 5 of 5 galaxies at @xmath3380@xmath6  kpc and 7 of 9 at @xmath33100@xmath6  kpc gave rise to strong .",
    "for a situation like pks  2135@xmath1147 , where the qso lies at the center of a cluster , we expect @xmath350% lower probabilities for the cluster galaxies producing  lines because roughly half the galaxies will lie behind the qso .",
    "any given cluster galaxy has no more than a 50% chance of producing  lines because of this ambiguity .",
    "the very limited statistics provided by lanzetta therefore suggest that galaxies 1 and 2 near pks  2135@xmath1147 each have a @xmath325% chance of contributing significantly to the absorption and a @xmath350% chance of contributing to .",
    "similarly , the more distant galaxy 3 has a @xmath325% chance of contributing to  but essentially no chance of causing strong absorption .",
    "these arguments based on projected distances suggest that the best candidate for the  absorber is the diffuse halo surrounding object a and the qso itself ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the likelihood of such a halo producing  lines is unknown .",
    "presumably many ( most ? ) qsos have host - galaxy halos like pks  2135@xmath1147 , but only @xmath325% of radio - loud and even fewer radio - quiet qsos have strong absorption lines at  ( @xcite ) .      the moderate resolution of the _ hst_-fos spectra ( @xmath3230  ) necessarily leads to uncertainties in the measured profiles and derived column densities .",
    "the full widths of the   lines appear marginally resolved in these data ( table 2 ) , but narrow , unresolved line components could `` hide '' considerable column density while contributing little to the line equivalent widths .",
    "in particular , line components with velocity widths as low as the thermal kinetic speeds of @xmath35 to @xmath320  could be present based on observations of intervening ( ) metal - line systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "the measured absorption line depths in pks  2135@xmath1147 , coupled with the and doublet ratios and the /  decrement , suggest that there are unresolved line components with large optical depths .",
    "the doublet ratios are consistent with optically thin absorption , but that result is uncertain because the lines are blended and the shape of the underlying broad emission - line profile is unknown .",
    "the last two columns in table 2 provide lower limits on the line - center optical depths ( @xmath34 ) and ionic column densities ( @xmath35 in ) assuming that each line is fully resolved with the rew and fwhm given by our gaussian fits .",
    "these values of @xmath34 and log  @xmath36 follow from a simple curve - of - growth analysis , where the doppler @xmath37-values relate to the fitted fwhm by @xmath37  =  fwhm/@xmath38 .",
    "the column densities , although strictly just lower limits , are typical of high - redshift  systems observed at much higher spectral resolutions from the ground ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "bergeron & boisse ( 1986 ) showed that the ionizing flux from the qso in pks  2135@xmath1147 overwhelms the intergalactic background radiation field throughout the cluster environment shown in figure 1 .",
    "they also showed that in this environment the qso s radiative flux can easily photoionize the gas up to and if the densities are typical of galactic disks or halos and the distances from the qso are comparable to the projected distances in figure 1 .",
    "our _ hst _ measurement of strong absorption indicates that even higher levels of ionization are present .",
    "the standard photoionization calculations plotted in figure 2b of hamann ( 1997 ) show that the ionization fractions of , and peak at ionization parameters of @xmath39 , 0.05 and 0.25 , respectively ( where @xmath40 is defined as the dimensionless ratio of hydrogen - ionizing photon to hydrogen particle densities ) .",
    "those calculations used an input spectrum believed to be typical of seyfert nuclei and low - redshift qsos ( from @xcite ) .",
    "the harder incident spectrum used by bergeron & boisse ( 1986 ) in similar calculations leads to slightly higher ionization states at the same @xmath40 , but the main results are the same .",
    "the strong presence of requires gas densities that are 5 to 10 times smaller , or distances from the qso that are 2 to 3 times shorter , than those needed for and alone .",
    "this level of ionization appears to be common in bals and other   systems that are known to be intrinsic ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is also easily attained in the halos of the cluster galaxies near pks  2135@xmath1147 via photoionization by the qso .",
    "if we adopt a distance to pks  2135@xmath1147 of 645@xmath6 mpc and scale the mathews & ferland ( 1987 ) spectrum to match the observed fluxes in figure 2 , we find that the ionization parameter is related to the gas density , @xmath41 , and the distance from the qso , @xmath42 , by ,  @xmath43 .",
    "the value of @xmath44 needed for strong is therefore within reach at low halo - like densities in the cluster galaxies .",
    "the most recent observations of intervening ( ) metal - line absorbers show that ionizations up to are commonplace even without the radiative flux of a nearby qso ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the detection of strong lines provides no insight into the location of the absorber .",
    "the similar column densities derived for , and in table 2 suggest that the absorber has a range of ionization states .",
    "a lower limit of @xmath45 follows from the non - detections of and ( see fig .",
    "2b in @xcite ) .",
    "the larger derived column densities and stronger evidence for saturation in and compared to suggest that higher ionizations dominate .",
    "we can place an approximate upper limit on the ionization parameter by assuming ( for the moment ) that the absorber has a single ionization state .",
    "this upper limit follows from the minimum column density in table 2 and the ( @xmath32@xmath11 ) upper limit on the total hydrogen column density @xmath46  from soft x - ray observations ( rachen , mannheim & biermann 1996 ; for solar abundances ) . together",
    "these results imply a neutral hydrogen fraction of /h",
    "@xmath47 , which corresponds to @xmath48 ( again , by fig .",
    "2b in @xcite ) .",
    "of course , a multi - phase absorber could still have components with little and much higher @xmath40 .",
    "future observations at shorter wavelengths could directly test for higher ionization components via the  @xmath22770,780 doublet , which has been measured now in two other  systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "if we assume that at least the relative column densities in table 2 are approximately correct , such that any saturation effects are the same for all lines , we can place lower limits on the metal abundances even with no knowledge of the ionization .",
    "photoionization calculations ( e.g. @xcite ) show that the ionization corrections needed to convert the column density ratios ( for example @xmath49()/@xmath49 ( ) ) into abundance ratios ( c / h ) always attain minimum values at some finite @xmath40 .",

    "whatever the location or ionization state of the absorber , we show that the c / h abundance ratio must be at least solar if the gas is photoionized by the qso and the derived _ relative _ column densities in and are roughly accurate .",

    "the only firm conclusion from the redshift analysis is that the   absorber has a line - of - sight velocity that is small ( less than @xmath4200  ) with respect to the qso .",
    "this small velocity shift could mean that the absorber lies outside the deep gravitational potential of the qso and its host - galaxy nucleus , at least a kpc away .",

    "these properties are known to correlate positively with both the strength and frequency of  lines ( @xcite , barthel , tytler & vestergaard 1997 ) , indicating that the absorbers in those cases are physically associated with the qso and/or its host galaxy .",
    "the recent detections of time - variable  lines in two radio - loud qsos ( @xcite ) suggest that the gas resides close to the qso ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the derived ( tentative ) metallicity in the pks  2135@xmath1147 absorber is too high for an intervening galaxy halo ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) but typical of known or suspected intrinsic systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the strong absorption compared to and is common among known or suspected intrinsic absorbers ( see @xcite and references therein ) but extremely rare in intervening metal - line systems ( excluding those with damped- ; @xcite ) .",
    "relatively strong lines are probably a good indicator of intrinsic versus intervening absorption in general .",
    "weymann ( 1981 ) and hartquist & snijders ( 1982 ) noted a strong observational trend for much larger / line ratios in  systems compared to .",
    "this dichotomy can not be understood simply in terms of higher ionization in  absorbers because recent studies show that   systems also typically have strong lines and therefore considerable high - ionization gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "is weak relative to both and in these systems .",
    "we propose that the lower / and / line ratios in intervening systems are caused by an underabundance of nitrogen ( relative to solar ratios ) in the low - metallicity galactic halos .",
    "relatively higher nitrogen abundances and stronger absorption lines should occur naturally in the metal - rich environments of intrinsic absorbers , e.g. in the inner regions of the massive galaxies that host qsos ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the combined / and / line ratios could , in fact , be used to measure or constrain the n / o and n / c abundances .",
    "we must be cautious , however , because saturation effects in the intrinsic systems (  3.3 ) could mimic the proposed abundance differences by driving the intrinsic line ratios toward unity .",
    "also , differences in the / and / line ratios between  and  systems might still derive from subtleties in the ionization rather than abundance effects .",
    "for example , in galaxy halos that are not near qsos , might fall in a narrow ionization `` gap '' between a photoionized gas component that produces mainly and the lower ions and a hot , collisionally ionized component that produces ( @xcite ) .",
    "might then be stronger in halos near qsos because of the increased _ photo_-ionization .",
    "such halo - near - qso systems would not meet our definition of intrinsic , and would not be expected to have enhanced nitrogen abundances , even though their lines are strong .",
    "further observations are needed to clearly identify the   absorber in pks  2135@xmath1147 .",
    "for example , higher resolution spectra of the qso and the cluster galaxies would allow us to ( 1 ) measure and compare the redshifts more precisely , ( 2 ) determine whether the  lines have narrow , multi - component profiles typical of intervening metal - line systems ( @xcite ) or smooth and relatively broad profiles like some known intrinsic systems ( @xcite , 1997b and 1997c ) , ( 3 ) carefully examine the multiplet ratios to test for partial line - of - sight coverage of the background light source as another indicator of intrinsic absorption ( @xcite ) , and ( 4 ) derive accurate column densities for the abundance and ionization analyses .",
    "monitoring the qso for line strength changes , particularly in response to continuum changes , might not only confirm the intrinsic hypothesis but place quantitative constraints on the absorber s density , ionization and distance from the qso ( @xcite ) .",
