    "in this paper , we look at the main result of jensen @xcite , the published version of the main result in jensen s phd thesis , supervised by h. h. andersen .",
    "when we were looking at the proof of this result more closely , we realised that there were some unfortunate holes in proof of this result .",
    "this paper is an attempt to fill these holes and thus establish the validity of his results .",
    "we also consider applications of the main result to the symmetric group and show that analogous results hold for the quantum group and the associated hecke algebra .",
    "our proof does not differ significantly from that in @xcite .",
    "in fact , it uses the same techniques and principles and we do not claim to have any new insights nor to offer anything other than a corrected version of jensen s proof , with further applications of the results . usually , the original author would offer corrections but this author has since left mathematics and the likelihood of an author correction seems slim . finding the characters of the tilting modules for @xmath4 , the special linear group of @xmath5 by @xmath5 matrices , where @xmath5 is a positive integer and @xmath1 and algebraically closed field of characteristic @xmath6 is equivalent to finding the characters of the tilting modules for @xmath7 ( the general linear group ) which in turn is equivalent to finding decomposition numbers for the symmetric group.the main result of @xcite is a description of the characters of the tilting modules for @xmath0 for @xmath8 and when the highest weight lies on the edge of the dominant region and lies in the second @xmath9 alcove away from the origin .",
    "thus we may deduce the decomposition numbers for the symmetric group provided our partitions have at most three parts and whose difference between the first and second part is at most @xmath10 ( approximately ) .",
    "actually , jensen does goes past the 2nd @xmath9 alcove slightly and so we may deduce decomposition numbers up to @xmath11 .",
    "we then consider @xmath12 and @xmath13 where the information flows the other way  we use the known decomposition numbers for the symmetric group to deduce various tilting modules .    finally , we consider what may be said about the mixed quantum case and deduce that analogous results hold there also .",
    "we first review the basic concepts and most of the notation that we will be using .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite and @xcite for further information .",
    "this material is also in  @xcite where is it presented from the group schemes point of view .    throughout this paper @xmath1",

    "we let @xmath19 be the weyl group of @xmath17 which is isomorphic to the symmetric group on three letters .",

    "we set @xmath29 and @xmath30 , with @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "then @xmath33 are the positive roots and @xmath34 are the simple roots .",
    "we also have @xmath35 , which is also half the sum of the positive roots .",
    "we have a partial order on @xmath36 defined by @xmath37 .",
    "a weight @xmath38 is _ dominant _ if @xmath39 for all @xmath40 and we let @xmath41 be the set of dominant weights .",
    "take @xmath42 and let @xmath43 be the one - dimensional module for @xmath18 which has weight @xmath38 .",
    "we define the induced module , @xmath44 .",
    "this module has formal character given by weyl s character formula and has simple socle @xmath45 , the irreducible @xmath17-module of highest weight @xmath38 . any finite dimensional , rational irreducible @xmath17-module is isomorphic to @xmath45 for a unique @xmath42 .",
    "we will denote the socle of a module @xmath46 by @xmath47 .",
    "we may use the transpose matrix map to define an antiautomorphism on @xmath17 . from this morphism",
    "we may define @xmath48 , a contravariant dual .",
    "it does not change a module s character , hence it fixes the irreducible modules .",
    "we define the weyl module , to be @xmath49 .",

    "we say that a @xmath17-module has a _ good filtration _",
    "if it has a filtration whose sections are isomorphic to induced modules and we say it has a _ weyl filtration _ if it the sections are isomorphic to weyl modules .",
    "a _ tilting module _ is a module with both a good filtration and a weyl filtration . for each @xmath42",
    "there is a unique _ indecomposable tilting module _ @xmath51 , with @xmath52=1 $ ] where the square brackets denote the composition multiplicity of @xmath45 in @xmath51 .",
    "a tilting module can be decomposed as a sum of these indecomposable ones .",
    "note that tilting modules are self - dual @xmath53 and hence that their socles must be isomorphic to their heads .",
    "we return to considering the weight lattice @xmath36 for @xmath17 .",
    "there are also the affine reflections @xmath54 for @xmath28 a positive root and @xmath55 which act on @xmath36 as @xmath56 .",
    "these generate the affine weyl group @xmath57 .",
    "we mostly use the dot action of @xmath57 on @xmath36 which is the usual action of @xmath57 , with the origin shifted to @xmath58 .",
    "so we have @xmath59 .",
    "each reflection in @xmath57 defines a hyperplane in @xmath36 .",
    "a _ facet _ for @xmath57 is a non - empty set of the form @xmath60 for suitable @xmath61 and for a disjoint decomposition @xmath62 .",
    "the _ closure _ @xmath63 of @xmath64 is @xmath65    the _ lower closure _ of @xmath64 is @xmath66    a facet @xmath64 is an _ alcove _ if @xmath67 , ( or equivalently @xmath64 is open in @xmath68 ) .",
    "if @xmath64 is an alcove for @xmath57 then its closure @xmath69 is a fundamental domain for @xmath57 acting on @xmath36 .",

    "we will also consider the group @xmath76 , which is generated by @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we may also define @xmath9-alcoves and walls using the hyperplanes associated with @xmath76 .",
    "we say that @xmath38 and @xmath80 are _ linked _ if they belong to the same @xmath57 orbit on @xmath36 ( under the dot action ) . if two irreducible modules @xmath45 and @xmath81 are in the same @xmath17 block then @xmath38 and @xmath80 are linked",
    ". we will extensively use _",
    "translation functors_.    given weights @xmath82 in the closure of some alcove @xmath64 , there is a unique dominant weight @xmath83 in @xmath84 .",
    "we define the _ translation functor _",
    "@xmath85 from @xmath38 to @xmath80 on a module @xmath86 by @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the largest submodule of @xmath86 all of whose composition factors have highest weights in @xmath89 .",
    "the properties that we require are summarised in @xcite .",
    "in particular we note the following : translates of tilting modules are also tilting modules .",
    "it is this principle that the proof of the main result is based on .",
    "the real question becomes how to decompose the translates into their indecomposable summands .",
    "usually we translate away from the origin , then the indecomposable tilting module of interest is the unique indecomposable summand with highest weight in the dominance order .",
    "one result used ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.1(ii ) ) is that the character of a tilting module for @xmath0 is also the sum of characters of tilting modules for @xmath2-@xmath90 , the quantum group in characteristic zero with @xmath2 a @xmath91th root of unity , @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "such `` quantum character considerations '' will prove crucial in proving the indecomposability of tilting modules for @xmath0 .",
    "the character of such a tilting module must simultaneously be the character of a ( decomposable ) tilting module for @xmath94{1}$]-@xmath90 , @xmath95{1}$]-@xmath90 , @xmath96{1}$]-@xmath90 and so on .",
    "as the characters of the tilting modules for @xmath2-@xmath90 are known , this gives a lower bound for the possible character of a tilting module for @xmath0 .",
    "we now assume that @xmath97 although much of what we say in this section generalises in an appropriate way to the more general case . throughout this paper",
    "we will draw diagrams of the weight space for @xmath17 .",
    "we will usually have large triangles for the @xmath9-alcoves , and smaller ones for the usual alcoves .",
    "we will also draw short lines for walls .",
    "we will almost always label @xmath58 which is the bottom corner of the fundamental alcove .",
    "when drawing such pictures we are usually drawing the `` character '' for a tilting module .",
    "this means entering the highest weights with multiplicities of the induced modules appearing in a good filtration of the tilting module .",
    "it is easy to apply translation functors to such diagrams , using the following proposition .",
    "[ propn : transgood ] let @xmath80 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 with @xmath100 , then @xmath101 has a good filtration .",
    "moreover the factors are @xmath102 with @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "each different @xmath105 occurs exactly once .",
    "we refer to weights which lie on only one hyperplane as _ wall _ weights and those which lie on more than one ( and hence three as this is @xmath0 ) as _ steinberg _ weights .",
    "when visualising the weight space we will refer to the subset of dominant weights as the dominant region .",
    "weights which lie close to the edge of this dominant region and which do not have a steinberg weight lying in the lower closure of the facet containing them are referred to as _ just dominant _ weights .",
    "the characters of the indecomposable tilting modules in the bottom @xmath9 alcove are well known .",
    "they are either the translate of a near - by simple module with highest weight a steinberg weight , or they can be deduced by decomposing translates ( necessary for tilting modules whose highest weight is just dominant . ) in all cases the characters coincide with the characters of the indecomposable tilting modules for an associated quantum group in characteristic zero with @xmath2 a @xmath6th root of unity .",
    "once we have a starting set of characters we can produce more indecomposable tilting modules using translation .",
    "suppose @xmath38 is not a steinberg weight and is not just dominant .",
    "let @xmath106 be the unique steinberg weight lying in the lower closure of the facet containing @xmath38 .",
    "then @xmath107    this presumably is well known , but can be deduced by generalising the argument in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.2 ) or by using donkin s tilting tensor product formula ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.1 ) and the known information about the injective @xmath108-hulls of simple modules for @xmath0 .",
    "the question really becomes then : what are the characters of the tilting modules whose highest weight is just dominant ?",
    "throughout this section we will assume that @xmath8 .",
    "we need @xmath109 in order to apply andersen s sum formula @xcite , and the `` inductive step '' for @xmath110 is only needed for two modules , neither of which are difficult to decompose and do not display the generic behaviour seen in the inductive step .",
    "the problem in jensen s proof lies in his inductive step ( @xcite ) , namely , he does nt explicitly state the embedding as part of the inductive hypothesis , and consequently perhaps , this embedding is not proved properly as part of the induction .",
    "in particular , summands are removed from the embedding without comment nor justification .",
    "we thus consider this part of the proof in greater detail , and take the base case of his induction as given , but take a much loser look at the `` minimal embeddings '' .",
    "we consider the wall case rather than the alcove case as there are less weights involved , thus cutting down the notated weights .",
    "the wall version and alcove versions are equivalent by translation and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.2 ) . the alcove case may be obtained by translating the wall case off the wall , an indecomposable tiling module remains indecomposable , but the number of weights involved doubles .",
    "we have the following picture ( figure [ fig : base ] ) as our base case for the induction .",
    "this is the wall version of the base case of jensen s induction ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( d ) ) , see also figure 5 ( a ) in the same reference .",
    "we have a minimal embedding @xmath111 it is worth clarifying what such a minimal embedding really means .",
    "it turns out that the modules of the right hand side of the above equation both have simple socle .",
    "it also turns out that they are injective for an associated generalised schur algebra for a suitable value of the degree of this schur algebra .",
    "details may be found in @xcite .",
    "thus , for a suitable truncation of @xmath112 the module @xmath113 is the injective hull of @xmath51 . indeed , in the proof of the following theorem",
    ", we could truncate @xmath20 to those modules whose composition factors have highest weight in the bottom 4 @xmath9-alcoves . in this category , any indecomposable tilting module whose highest weight is not just dominant and is not in the bottom @xmath9-alcove is injective .",
    "since the tilting modules are self - dual , the injective hull of @xmath51 is also its projective cover .",
    "we do not use this fact in the sequel however .",
    "the following theorem differs from that in jensen in that the embeddings proved as part of the induction are not the ones he used .",
    "we can recover the embeddings he used which are in fact minimal , and do so in proposition [ propn : embed ] but we could not see how to get them as part of the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] but rather as a corollary of it .    [ thm : main ] we have the following cases :    1 .",
    "suppose @xmath38 is just dominant and lies on an @xmath31-wall then @xmath51 has character as depicted in figure [ fig : lambdaandmu ] ( a ) and has an embedding : @xmath114 2 .",
    "suppose @xmath80 is just dominant and lies on a horizontal wall ( @xmath115-wall ) then @xmath116 has character as depicted in figure [ fig : lambdaandmu ] ( b ) and has an embedding : @xmath117    we prove the result by induction taking the base case depicted in figure [ fig : base ] as read .",
    "for this part compare with @xcite .",
    "we assume that we have a tilting module @xmath51 as depicted in figure [ fig : lambdaandmu ]  ( a ) .",
    "we now translate @xmath51 to the wall containing @xmath80 .",
    "we get a module @xmath118 which is tilting , but not necessarily indecomposable , which is depicted in figure [ fig : ltomu ] .",
    "we translate @xmath118 again to the next wall and call this tilting module @xmath119 .",
    "this module is depicted in figure [ fig : mutoeta ] ( a ) .",
    "now it is clear that the tilting module with highest weight @xmath120 may be removed by @xmath121 considerations .",
    "the dotted line in figure [ fig : mutoeta ] ( a ) and ( b ) is the line parallel to @xmath31 which goes through @xmath80 . restricting to the corresponding levi subgroup , which is isomorphic to @xmath122 and using the results of @xcite , the multiplicities of the weights along this line are the same as the multiplicities in @xmath122 . in particular",
    ", @xmath123 is not a component of @xmath124 .",
    "as @xmath120 is the next highest weight in @xmath119 , this means that @xmath125 is in fact a direct summand of @xmath119 .",
    "we now want to remove two copies of @xmath126 from @xmath119 if possible .",
    "we can do this using andersen s sum formula @xcite .",
    "the value we get for the sum formula for @xmath119 with the summand @xmath125 removed , is zero and so @xmath126 occurs with multiplicity two in @xmath119 . if we translate back again to @xmath80 then we see that @xmath127 occurs with multiplicity two in @xmath118 .",
    "( we can do this by applying ( * ? ? ? * lemma 4.7 ) to the translates of @xmath119 and @xmath118 into the alcoves and noting that translating off a wall into an alcove preserves the number of indecomposable components . )",
    "we thus have that @xmath118 has @xmath128 as a direct summand and @xmath119 has @xmath129 as a direct summand .",
    "we can therefore write @xmath119 as @xmath130 .",
    "we will return to decompose @xmath131 further later , but we claim that @xmath132 .",
    "now the module we get when we remove @xmath128 from @xmath118 is tilting and has the character depicted in figure [ fig : lambdaandmu](a ) . now a tilting module with such a character must be indecomposable by quantum character considerations .",
    "thus we must have @xmath133 and we have shown that @xmath116 has the desired character .",
    "we now consider what the socle of @xmath116 can be .",
    "now since @xmath116 is self - dual and has a good filtration , we must have @xmath134 we also know that the head of @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) must appear in the socle of @xmath116 ( as it is self - dual ) and the socle of the `` bottom '' @xmath137 in a good filtration must be in the socle .",
    "thus @xmath138 where we use the labelling of figure [ fig : ltomu ] for the weights .",
    "we now translate the previous embedding .",
    "so @xmath139 thus @xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath142 coincide for the very first application of the inductive step , but are generically different .",
    "hence @xmath143 the socles ( in order ) of the tilting modules on the right hand side are : @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "thus by intersecting this list and equation we get that @xmath150 and @xmath151    in @xcite , it is rightly claimed that when we translate the minimal embedding ( jensen s claimed embedding ) of @xmath51 to @xmath116 that we get an embedding @xmath152 ( corresponding to the @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath31 and @xmath156 of @xcite respectively ) .",
    "after removal of two copies of @xmath127 ( = @xmath157 ) and @xmath158 , whose socle does not coincide with the highest weight of @xmath137 appearing in @xmath116 we get an embedding @xmath159 _ not _ @xmath160 as claimed in @xcite .",
    "there is no justification given for the removal of the extra @xmath127 .",
    "in fact , we have to work harder to remove this extra summand in the next proposition .",
    "we take the embedding in equation and translate it to @xmath161 .",
    "we get @xmath162 note that @xmath163 .",
    "so @xmath164 using the labels depicted in figure [ fig : mutoeta ] ( b ) , ( corresponding to the @xmath161 , @xmath80 , @xmath28 , @xmath83 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 of @xcite respectively ) .",
    "note that @xmath120 may coincide with @xmath167 although generically it does nt .",
    "this embedding is in contrast to the claimed embedding obtained by jensen in @xcite .",
    "he gets @xmath168 firstly , the @xmath38 should be a @xmath83 .",
    "this is not a serious error as @xmath51 embeds into @xmath169 .",
    "the extra copy of @xmath116 is missing  possibly due to thinking that the translate of @xmath170 is @xmath116 rather than @xmath171 .",
    "he does nt have a @xmath172 as this comes from the extra @xmath157 .",
    "the remark about the multiplicites and referring to @xmath173 ( surely not relevant to the induction ? ) does nt make sense , as they already have multiplicity one .",
    "we continue with our own argument by noting that @xmath174 embeds in @xmath175 so our obtained embedding for @xmath131 is still consistent with our claim that @xmath176 .    now",
    "the socle of @xmath126 is not the head of any @xmath177 appearing in a good filtration of @xmath131 and so the socle of @xmath131 can not contain the socle of @xmath126 .",
    "thus we can remove @xmath126 from the right hand side of the previous equation to get , @xmath178 where we have defined @xmath179 to be the module given by the right hand side of this equation .",
    "this module is depicted in figure [ fig : qembed ] .",
    "( the module @xmath179 is analogous to the module @xmath180 in @xcite but with an extra @xmath116 and @xmath169 in place of @xmath51 . )",
    "we have @xmath181 and so @xmath182 . we may now repeat the argument of this part of the proof of @xcite to show that @xmath174 is a summand of @xmath131 .    when we remove @xmath174 from @xmath131 we get a module which is indecomposable by consideration of quantum characters and we so get a tilting module , which must be @xmath124 , of the desired character .    since @xmath183 and this is distinct from the socles of @xmath125 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 we also get that @xmath187 and this is the desired embedding .",
    "[ propn : embed ] the following maps are minimal embeddings . @xmath188 and @xmath189    consider equation . it remains to show that @xmath127 is not needed for this embedding .",
    "this is equivalent to showing that the socle of @xmath127 which is @xmath147 is not in the socle of @xmath116 .",
    "now @xmath147 is in the socle of @xmath116 if the socle of @xmath190 which appears in @xmath116 moves down into the socle of @xmath116 .",
    "since the unique indecomposable extension of @xmath191 by @xmath190 has simple socle , this is equivalent to saying that this extension does not embed into @xmath116 . since",
    "this extension is isomorphic to @xmath192 ( see figure [ fig : mutoeta ] for @xmath193 ) , this is the same as saying that @xmath194 does not embed in @xmath195 .",
    "( recall that @xmath131 is the tilting module in figure [ fig : mutoeta ] ( b ) . ) but we have shown that @xmath194 embeds in @xmath131 and hence that @xmath147 is not in the socle of @xmath116 .",
    "now note that this embedding must be minimal .",
    "firstly we must have @xmath196 on the right hand side as the socle of @xmath197 must be contained in the socle of @xmath116 using equation .",
    "also the good filtration of @xmath196 does not contain @xmath198 which is in @xmath116 and so characters tell us that @xmath197 can not give us the minimal embedding for @xmath116 .",
    "the previous proof showed that @xmath51 embeds into @xmath199 .",
    "we wish to show that @xmath200 is not required for this embedding .",
    "i.e. that the socle of @xmath200 which @xmath201 is not in the socle of @xmath51 .",
    "now if @xmath201 were in the socle of @xmath51 then we must have @xmath202 now @xmath203 which is nt in the socle of @xmath204 and so @xmath201 can not be in the socle of @xmath51 .    also note that this embedding must be minimal as both the socles of @xmath205 and @xmath206 are the weights of `` bottom '' @xmath137 s in a good filtration of @xmath51 and the socle of @xmath207 is the head of @xmath208 and so must also be in the socle of @xmath51 .",
    "what happens when @xmath80 or @xmath38 lies on a @xmath9 wall ? we may then proceed as jensen did to produce pictures of the characters for various tilting modules , so we do not reproduce his results here .",
    "we unfortunately get to the same impasse as jensen in that we can not prove that his picture in @xcite is the character of a tilting module .",
    "however we have verified the results in @xcite .",
    "so is the following picture the character of an indecomposable tilting module ?",

    "these are easily calculated using the action of the affine weyl group and we just summarise the results in the tables below . since filtration multiplicities for tilting modules are the same as decomposition numbers for the symmetric group , this also gives some three - part decomposition numbers , using the formula @xmath209 $ ] . here",

    "we may take the tilting module @xmath223 and continue translating , as in the @xmath216 case .",
    "the translates remain indecomposable and so we may obtain the tilting modules ( on the edge ) up to @xmath224 as in the @xmath216 case .    for prime 2 more interesting things happen  partly because @xmath225 is bigger that @xmath226 !",
    "thus the prime two case gives a hint at what may happen for larger primes once we get past the next @xmath9 wall .",
    "we include pictures of all the edge cases for prime two up to the @xmath227 weight @xmath228 .",
    "( the non - edge cases may be found as for the other primes by translating the appropriate tilting module off a steinberg weight . ) in these pictures we have drawn the @xmath229-hyperplanes as dashed lines , the @xmath230-hyperplanes as solid lines , the @xmath231-hyperplanes as thicker solid lines and so on .",
    "multiplicites higher than 3 are indicated with numbers rather then numerous concentric circles .",
    "the first 8 pictures may be thought of as degenerate versions of the ( wall version ) of the @xmath216 result .",
    "once we have highest weight @xmath232 , however , the patterns change .",
    "@xmath233 @xmath234 @xmath235 @xmath236 @xmath237 close study of these pictures do reveal some patterns .",
    "for instance , the `` top '' half of the diagram for @xmath238 is the same as all of @xmath239 .",
    "these type of repetitions are to be expected , as the corresponding schur algebra often has a quotient which is isomorphic to a smaller schur algebra .",
    "( the quotient result is implicit in @xcite and more explicit in @xcite . )",
    "unfortunately , prehaps two is still too small to give insight into the generic case . especially given its divergence after @xmath240 .",
    "we also see that quantum character arguments are not always enough to show that a module is indecomposable .",
    "if we consider the character for @xmath241 we see that this tilting module is _ not _ predicted to be indecomposable using a quantum character argument rather character arguments predict that @xmath242 is a summand of this module .",
    "in this section we consider what we can say about the quantum case . here",
    "we use the dipper - donkin quantum group @xmath2-@xmath243 defined in  @xcite .",
    "the interesting case is the so called `` mixed case '' , the one where @xmath2 is a primitive @xmath3th root of unity and @xmath1 has characteristic @xmath6 .",
    "we necessarily have @xmath244 .",
    "we may generalise our argument from @xmath0 to @xmath2-@xmath245 by replacing all occurrences of @xmath9 with @xmath246 ( and @xmath247 by @xmath248 and so on ) . to do this we need to assume that there are alcove weights , so that andersen s sum formula is valid .",
    "thus , we need to assume that @xmath249 and hence that @xmath8 .",
    "the other key ingredient is the result that the character of a quantum tilting module in the mixed case should also be the sum of characters of tilting modules in characteristic zero with @xmath2 now a @xmath3th , @xmath246th , @xmath248th etc , root of unity .",
    "this generalisation of the `` classical '' result is not so straight forward .",
    "the proof works the same way , in that we need a more general ring structure on the tilting module which can then be specialised to different rings . now",
    "* section 5.3 ) shows that a mixed tilting module lifts to the local ring @xmath250_{\\mathfrak{m}}$ ] with @xmath251 being the kernel of the specialisation to an @xmath3th root in a characteristic @xmath6 field .",
    "hence the character of a mixed tilting module is a sum of tilting characters over any field which is an algebra over this local ring .",
    "this includes for instance the complex numbers made into such an algebra by specialising @xmath193 to a primitive @xmath3th root of @xmath252 . to get the character result we need @xmath2 to be a @xmath253th root of unity .",
    "now if @xmath254 then the cyclotomic polynomial @xmath255 specialises to @xmath256 when @xmath193 is specialised to a primitive @xmath3th root of @xmath252 in a characteristic @xmath6 field .",
    "this shows that the complex numbers are in fact an algebra over the relevant local ring .",
    "hence the method indicated does in fact generalise the result of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.1(ii ) ) to the mixed quantum case .    equipped with these results and all the usual translation theory etc . for @xmath2-@xmath243 we may now obtain the analogous `` pictures '' of the tilting modules .",
    "we need to be a bit careful  really we must work with the analogue of @xmath243 and not @xmath0 .",
    "of course , the connection between @xmath243 and @xmath0 is in this case really a matter of tensoring with the appropriate power of the determinant module .",
    "we could equally well work with the weights for @xmath243 and apply translation functors in exactly the same way as for @xmath0 .",
    "in other words , we can be confident that the quantum analogue of the decomposition numbers in the tables in section [ sect : gln ] are also true with @xmath9 replaced by @xmath246 and @xmath6 replaced by @xmath3 where @xmath3 is at least @xmath13 and @xmath6 is at least @xmath14 .",
    "these decomposition numbers are thus also decomposition numbers for the corresponding hecke algebra using the schur functor .",
    "i am very grateful to andrew mathas and jrgen mller for their help with gap3 and gap4 respectively and for providing various decomposition matrices .",
    "i am also very grateful to henning andersen for his remarks regarding the characters of tilting modules for the mixed quantum group restricting to characters of tilting modules for the quantum group in characteristic zero .",
