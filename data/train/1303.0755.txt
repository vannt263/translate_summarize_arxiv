    "the nontrivial properties of the vacuum are among the most important consequences in quantum field theory .",
    "these properties depend on both the local and global geometrical characteristics of the background spacetime .",
    "in particular , the boundary conditions imposed on a quantum field in spaces with non - trivial topology modify the spectrum for zero - point fluctuations which give rise to change in the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) for physical observables .",
    "a well known example of this kind of phenomenon is the topological casimir effect .",
    "the explicit dependence of the physical characteristics of the vacuum on the geometrical properties of the bulk , can be found for highly - symmetric backgrounds only . in this paper",
    "we consider an exactly solvable problem for the fermionic vacuum polarization by a cosmic string in the background of anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime .",
    "the importance of ads spacetime as a background geometry in quantum field theory is motivated by several reasons .",
    "the early interest was related to principal questions of the quantization of fields on curved backgrounds .",
    "the lack of global hyperbolicity and the presence of both regular and irregular modes give rise to a number of new phenomena which have no analogs in quantum field theory on the minkowski bulk .",
    "these phenomena have been discussed by several authors considering both scalar @xcite-@xcite and spinor @xcite-@xcite fields .",
    "the importance of this research increased by the natural appearance of ads spacetime as a ground state in supergravity and kaluza - klein theories .",
    "the ads geometry plays a crucial role in two exciting developments in theoretical physics of the past decade such as the ads / cft correspondence and the braneworld scenario with large extra dimensions . the ads / cft correspondence ( for a review see ahar ) , represents a realization of the holographic principle and relates string theories or supergravity in ads bulk with a conformal field theory living on its boundary .",
    "the braneworld scenario offers a new perspective on the hierarchy problem between the gravitational and electroweak mass scales ( for reviews on braneworld gravity and cosmology see @xcite ) .",
    "the main idea to resolve the large hierarchy is that the small coupling of 4-dimensional gravity is generated by the large physical volume of extra dimensions .    in the framework of grand unified theories , different types of topological defects",
    "may have been created in the early universe as a consequence of the vacuum phase transition @xcite . among them",
    "cosmic strings are of special interest .",
    "although recent observations data on the cosmic microwave background have ruled out cosmic strings as the primary source for primordial density perturbation , they are still candidate for the generation of a number of interesting physical effects such as gamma ray burst berezinski , gravitational waves @xcite and high energy cosmic rays @xcite . recently ,",
    "cosmic strings have attracted renewed interest partly because a variant of their formation mechanism is proposed in the framework of brane inflation @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the geometry of a cosmic string in the background of ads spacetime has been considered in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that , similar to the case of minkowskian bulk , at distances from the string larger than its core radius , the gravitational effects of the string can be described by a planar angle deficit in the ads line - element .",
    "the corresponding non - trivial topology induces vacuum polarization effects for quantum fields .",
    "these effects are well - investigated for the geometry of a cosmic string in minkowski spacetime for scalar @xcite-@xcite , fermionic ferm-@xcite and vector quantum fields @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently the corresponding results have been generalized for cosmic string in curved spacetime .",
    "specifically , one - loop quantum effects have been considered for a massless scalar field in schwarzschild spacetime adrian , for massive scalar @xcite and fermionic @xcite fields in de sitter spacetime , and also for a massive scalar field in ads spacetime @xcite . in the present paper , we continue along similar line of investigation , analyzing the fermionic vacuum polarization effects associated with a massive dirac spinor field in a four - dimensional ads spacetime in the presence of a cosmic string . among the most important local physical characteristics of the fermionic vacuum",
    "are the fermionic condensate and the vev of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the fermionic condensate plays an important role in the models of dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry , whereas the vev of the energy - momentum tensor acts as the source of gravity in the quasiclassical einstein equations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we present the background geometry associated with the spacetime under consideration and construct the complete set of positive- and negative - energy fermionic wave - functions . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we calculate the fermion condensate by using the mode - summation method . in this evaluation",
    "the contribution induced by the cosmic string is separately analyzed and its behavior in the asymptotic regions of the parameters is investigated .",
    "the analysis of the vev of the energy - momentum tensor is considered in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "there , the contribution induced by the cosmic string is also investigated .",
    "finally , the main results of the paper are summarized in section [ conc ] . in appendix",
    "we show that the mode functions used in the main text are obtained when the mit bag boundary condition is imposed at a finite distance from the ads boundary , which is then taken to zero . throughout of the paper",
    "we shall use the units @xmath0 .",
    "the main objective of this section is to obtain the complete set of fermionic mode - functions in a four - dimensional ads spacetime in presence of a cosmic string .",

    "although the line element for an infinite straight cosmic string in the background of minkowski spacetime , which corresponds to the expression inside the parentheses in ( [ ds2 ] ) , has been derived in @xcite by making use of weak - field approximation , the validity of this solution has been extended beyond the linear perturbation theory by several authors gott85 . in this case",
    "the parameter @xmath10 need not to be close to the unity .",
    "the metric tensor corresponding to the line element ( [ ds1 ] ) is an exact solution of the einstein equation in the presence of a negative cosmological constant and the string @xcite , for arbitrary values of @xmath10 .",
    "the quantum motion of a massive spinor field on curved spacetime is governed by the dirac equation @xmath16where @xmath17 are the dirac matrices in curved spacetime and @xmath18 is the spin connection .",

    "we show that this procedure leads to the choice of the mode functions in the form ( zl ) and ensures the zero current of fermions through the ads boundary .",
    "note that the boundary condition we have used also excludes the normalizable modes with @xmath59 , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the macdonald function .",
    "finally , we can write the upper two - component spinor in the form @xmath62having the upper component spinor , the lower one is obtained by using the first equation of ( [ dirac1 ] ) .",

    "the normalization condition on the functions provides an extra equation .",
    "consequently , one of the coefficients remains arbitrary . in order to determine this coefficient some additional condition",
    "should be imposed on the coefficients .",
    "the necessity for this condition is related to the fact that the quantum numbers @xmath73 do not specify the fermionic wave - function uniquely and some additional quantum number is required .    in order to specify the second constant we impose the condition @xmath74by taking into account ( [ b12 ] ) we get the relations : @xmath75where and in what follows @xmath76note that one has @xmath77 . with the condition ( adcond ) , the fermionic mode functions are uniquely specified by the set @xmath78 . instead of ( [ adcond ] ) we could impose another condition .",
    "the only restriction is that the resulting wave - functions should form a complete set .",
    "for example , the condition similar to ( [ adcond ] ) with the opposite sign of the right - hand side gives another set of wave - functions .",
