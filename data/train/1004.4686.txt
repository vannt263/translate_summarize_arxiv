    "estimation of the power spectral density of a continuous time mean square continuous stationary stochastic process is a classical problem @xcite .",
    "estimates are usually based on finitely many observed points .",
    "if the spectral density of the process is bandlimited ( i.e. , compactly supported ) , then one can estimate it consistently by using uniformly spaced samples , provided the sampling rate is faster than the nyquist rate @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the spectral density is not bandlimited , then uniform sampling at any sampling rate leads to aliasing , i.e. , there is a class of continuous processes whose spectral densities are indistinguishable from the sampled process .",
    "thus , one can not estimate the spectral density of the original process consistently on the basis of uniformly spaced samples @xcite .",
    "in such a situation , non - uniform or irregular sampling schemes have been explored .",
    "silverman and shapiro @xcite introduced a notion of alias - free sampling .",
    "beutler @xcite further formalized this definition of alias - free sampling for different classes of power spectra .",
    "masry @xcite gave another definition of alias - free sampling .",
    "for each sampling scheme that is alias - free according to this definition , he provided a corresponding estimator of the spectral density , which would be consistent under certain conditions .",
    "poisson sampling ( i.e. , sampling at the arrival times of a homogeneous poisson process ) turns out to be alias - free for the class of all spectra , according to both the definitions .",
    "the existence of consistent estimators in the non - bandlimited case makes non - uniform sampling schemes , in particular poisson process sampling , very attractive .",
    "however , consistency is only a large sample property of an estimator .",
    "srivastava and sengupta @xcite showed that , if one has the ability to sample the process arbitrarily fast , then one can consistently estimate a non - bandlimited spectral density through uniformly spaced samples also , provided the sampling rate goes to infinity at a suitable rate as the sample size goes to infinity . by comparing the smoothed periodogram estimator with the corresponding estimator based on the poisson process sampling , they found that , under certain regularity conditions , the rates of convergence for the two estimators are comparable and the constants associated with the rates of convergence have a trade - off in terms of bias and variance .",
    "thus , the existence of a consistent estimator is not an exclusive advantage of point process sampling .",
    "an attractive property of the spectrum estimator based on poisson sampling @xcite is that the estimator is consistent for any average sampling rate .",
    "this property implies that one can estimate bandlimited spectra consistently , even if the sampling is done at a sub - nyquist average rate .",
    "such estimators show that deficiencies in sampling rate can be made up by sample size , provided one is prepared to sample at irregular intervals .",
    "this fact gives rise to the hope that even when there is a constraint on the sampling rate , one can judiciously use non - uniform sampling to consistently estimate spectra with much larger bandwidth than what can be achieved through uniform sampling .",
    "it is important to note that a small average sampling rate does not mean that _ any _ two successive samples are far apart . in the case of poisson process sampling with any average sampling rate",
    ", it can be seen that as the sample size goes to infinity , there would be a large number of pairs of consecutive samples which are nearer to each other than any specified threshold .",
    "thus , in order to use poisson process sampling with any average sampling rate , sometimes one has to sample the process very fast .",
    "many other non - uniform and alias - free sampling schemes also have this requirement .",
    "all these schemes become infeasible if there is a hard limit on the minimum separation between successive samples .",
    "such a constraint can arise because of technological limits as well as economic considerations .    books on sampling @xcite give a clear picture of the limitations of uniform sampling in respect of a constraint on the minimum separation between successive samples .",
    "however , suitability of non - uniform sampling schemes in the presence of this constraint has not been studied so far @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the problem of consistent estimation of the power spectral density of a stationary stochastic process through non - uniform sampling , under a constraint on the minimum separation between successive samples . in section  [ s2 ] , we describe the underlying set - up and discuss the notions of alias - free sampling provided by shapiro and silverman @xcite as well as by masry @xcite . in section  [ s3 ] , we consider the class of all power spectra , and show that under the above constraint , no stationary point process sampling scheme is alias - free for this class .",
    "subsequently , we study the possibility of alias - free sampling for estimation of spectra that are known to be confined to a certain bandwidth . in section  [ s4 ] , we discuss the difficulties of obtaining a consistent estimator of the power spectrum even when it is known to be bandlimited . in section  [ s5 ] , we report the results of a simulation study of the performance of a commonly used estimator based on poisson process sampling , in the presence of the above constraint . we summarize the findings and provide some concluding remarks in section  [ s6 ] .",

    "if @xmath2 has a density , we denote it by @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a sequence of real - valued , stochastic sampling times .",
    "shapiro and silverman s @xcite notion of alias free sampling , which was further formalized by beutler @xcite , is based on the following assumptions about the sampling process .",
    "the process @xmath5 is independent of @xmath6 .",

    "beutler s definition of alias - free sampling , based on shapiro and silverman s earlier idea , is as follows .    * definition 1 . * the sampling process @xmath5 satisfying assumptions * a1 * and * a2 * is alias - free relative to the class of spectra @xmath13 if no two random processes with different spectra belonging to @xmath13 yield the same covariance sequence ( @xmath14 ) of the sampled process .",
    "shapiro and silverman @xcite had considered the special case where the sampling times constitute a renewal process , and @xmath13 is the class of _ all _ spectra with integrable and square integrable densities .",
    "they referred to this scheme as additive random sampling , and showed that it is alias - free , provided the characteristic function of the inter - arrival distribution takes no value more than once on the real line . in particular , poisson process ( a renewal process having exponentially distributed inter - arrival times ) sampling scheme is alias - free for the class of spectra @xmath13 .",
    "the above definition has the drawback that it does not make use of the information contained in the sampling times .",
    "if one wishes to reconstruct @xmath3 using a sampling scheme that is alias - free according to the above definition , then that would be done on the basis of the sequence @xmath14 only .",
    "beutler @xcite gave a procedure for this reconstruction , and indicated that this procedure may be used to estimate @xmath3 from estimates of @xmath14 .",
    "however , masry @xcite pointed out that the above definition does not lead to a spectrum estimator that is provably consistent .",
    "from all these considerations , this approach appears to be rather restrictive . in practice",
    ", one would expect to use the information contained not only in the sampled values , but also in the sampling times , in order to estimate the power spectral density . in order to take into account the sampling times ,",
    "masry @xcite gave an alternative definition of alias - free sampling , while making assumption * a1 * and the following additional assumption about the sampling process .",
    "the process @xmath5 constitutes a stationary orderly second - order point process on the real line .",

    "this density corresponds to the covariance function @xmath35 some other members of @xmath36 can be constructed by convolving @xmath37 with an arbitrary power spectral density .",
    "we show in the appendix that if @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are independent mean square continuous stochastic processes such that @xmath39 and @xmath40 have spectra in @xmath36 and have the same variance , then the spectra of @xmath41 and @xmath42 can not be distinguished from the sequence @xmath14 or the measure @xmath24 , leading to aliasing according to definitions  1 and  2 .",
    "one can easily construct two _ integrable and square integrable _ power spectral densities that are indistinguishable from @xmath14 or @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the statements of theorems  1 and  2 also hold in respect of all spectra having integrable and square integrable densities ( rather than all spectra ) . thus , the alias - free property of poisson process sampling mentioned in section  [ s2 ] become inapplicable , once the inter - sample spacings are adjusted in accordance with the constraint  * a4*.    these two theorems show that , under the constraint of a minimum inter - sample spacing , any point process sampling scheme would be inadequate for the identification of a completely unrestricted power spectral density  according to the existing notions of alias - free sampling .",
    "if the power spectral density of the original continuous time process is not identifiable from the sequence @xmath14 or the covariance measure @xmath24 , then one can not expect to consistently estimate the power spectral density on the basis of estimates of either of these .",
    "note that the assumption * a4 * comes from a practical consideration , and it is difficult to think of an implementable sampling scheme that would not require it ( i.e. , a scheme that can have arbitrarily closely spaced samples ) .    it is well known that estimators based on uniformly spaced samples , irrespective of the sampling rate , also suffer from the limitation of non - identifiability .",
    "in fact , it is this limitation of uniform sampling that has been historically used as one of the major arguments in favor of non - uniform sampling schemes .",
    "the above theorems show that the same difficulty applies to practical non - uniform sampling schemes as well .",
    "in the case of uniform sampling , it is well known that a bandlimited process would not lead to aliasing provided that the sampling is done at the nyquist rate or faster . on the other hand",
    ", uniform sampling at any fixed rate would be free from the problem of aliasing if and only if the spectrum of the continuous time process is known to be confined to an appropriate band .",
    "this fact , together with the limitation of point process sampling in the case of non - bandlimited spectra , gives rise to the question : can point process sampling under assumption * a4 * be alias - free for the class of bandlimited spectra ?",
    "if so , it would be interesting to compare the maximum allowable spectral bandwidths for alias - free sampling , arising from uniform and point process sampling schemes under assumption * a4*.    it turns out that alias - free sampling under assumption * a4 * is possible for an important class of stochastic sampling schemes , namely , renewal process sampling .",
    "this is a special case of point process sampling , which has received much attention from researchers @xcite .",
    "poisson process sampling is a further special case of renewal process sampling .",
    "however , it is an ideal sampling scheme , in contrast with implementable schemes that would require assumption * a4*.     on the complex plane for the left truncated exponential distribution , with mean @xmath43 and truncation point @xmath27 , for @xmath44.,width=336,height=240 ]    the benchmark for the present study would be the fastest possible rate of uniform sampling under assumption * a4 * , which is @xmath45 .",

    "we have shown in section  [ s3 ] that when the inter - sample spacing is constrained to be larger than a threshold , renewal process sampling schemes are alias - free for suitably bandlimited spectra according to definition 1 .",
    "the range of bandwidths for alias - free renewal process sampling for some inter - sample spacing distributions is smaller than the corresponding range for regular sampling , while it is larger for some other distributions . on the other hand , according to definition 2 , all renewal process samplings schemes satisfying the conditions of theorem  5 are alias - free for the class of spectra limited to any finite band .",
