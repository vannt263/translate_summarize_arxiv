    "<S> the nv center array was made by implanting 60 kev @xmath13 molecules with the fluence @xmath14 @xmath15 and the implantation angle @xmath16 through 45 nm diameter apertures patterned using electron beam lithography in a 300-nm - thick polymethyl methacrylate ( pmma ) layer deposited on diamond surface.@xcite the average depth of the nv centers was about 40 nm and the longitudinal and lateral straggling were about 11 and 9 nm , respectively , inferred from srim simulations . after implantation </S>",

    "<S> nv center generation corresponded to about 5 nitrogen atoms per aperture ( 45 nm diameter ) , so it was thought that the spin bath for the nv center was mainly contributed by @xmath18 in the diamond . </S>",
    "<S> in such a system , the hamiltonian of nv center can be expressed as @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the nv center s electronic spin , g = 2.00 is the electron g factor , @xmath21 is the bohr magneton , @xmath22 is the applied magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the third term describes hyperfine coupling of the nv center spin to the bath of @xmath18 spins , and the last term describes the internal dynamics of the @xmath18 nuclear spin bath . in general , the zero - field splitting parameter d(t ) depends on temperature t , axial electric field , and strain . for temperature detection based on d(t ) , we resonantly manipulate the spin states such that the unwanted relative phase are canceled , getting the common phase factor @xmath23 , with the phase proportional to d only . </S>",
    "<S> this detection produces a fluorescence intensity ( @xmath24 ) oscillating between @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) and @xmath24 ( @xmath26 ) with the frequency given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the microwave carrier frequencies used for spin manipulation.@xcite when the change of oscillation frequency is determined , the change of d and hence the corresponding local temperature change can be deduced .    at zero magnetic field , by applying a thermal echo ( te ) pulse sequence@xcite , as shown in figure [ figure 1](d ) , the electronic spin of the nv center was firstly initialized to a superposition state by a @xmath29 pulse . </S>",
    "<S> after half the total evolution time , a @xmath30 echo pulse was used to reverse the population of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 states . </S>",
    "<S> after another half of the total free evolution time , the relative phases between the @xmath33 levels , caused by quasi - static fluctuations of magnetic field , were canceled , getting the common phase factor @xmath23 , with the phase proportional to d. the te sequence produced a long coherence time of @xmath3 63.5 @xmath0 , which was comparable with that of the native nv center in high - quality diamond.@xcite however , there was not significant oscillations when we detuned the microwave carrier frequencies ( @xmath28 ) from d. this result was confirmed by using other implanted single nv centers in the sample . </S>",
    "<S> this was attributed to the implanted n electron spin defects and the paramagnetic residual structure defects.@xcite it was concluded that the te method at zero magnetic field@xcite was difficult to be used on the implanted nv center for temperature sensing .    </S>",
    "<S> then we applied the thermal ramsey ( t - ramsey ) , te , and tcpmg - n methods to the implanted nv centers for temperature sensing under finite magnetic fields . in these experiments , </S>",
    "<S> two microwave radiation fields with different frequencies @xmath34 and @xmath35 , in general , are used to manipulate the transitions of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively . to induce oscillations in @xmath38 , both the microwave carrier frequencies are slightly detuned from the corresponding resonance frequencies . </S>",

    "<S> so we can deduce the coherence time @xmath41 and oscillation frequency @xmath43 ( hence the zero - field splitting d ) by fitting the recorded @xmath38 to eq . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .    for the t - ramsey experiment </S>",
    "<S> as shown in figure 1(e)@xcite , the spin was firstly initialized into a superposition state @xmath44 by a @xmath45 pulse . </S>",
    "<S> after half of the total evolution time , a triple echo pulse sequence of the form @xmath46 was applied to swap the population of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 states , where the @xmath47 and @xmath48 were the @xmath30-pulses applied to manipulate the @xmath49 and @xmath50 transition , respectively.@xcite after another half the total evolution time , the relative phases between the @xmath51 and @xmath32 states were canceled , getting a total phase factor @xmath23 , which was only related to d , independent of low - frequency magnetic noise . </S>",
    "<S> we got a coherence time of 7.7 @xmath0 for the t - ramsey sequence , which was larger than the values of 15 @xmath0 for nanodiamonds.@xcite the reason was that , for nanodiamonds , the spin bath contains nuclear spins ( @xmath18 ) , high concentration of electron spins ( [ n ] about 100ppm ) , and surface layer spins.@xcite    . </S>",

    "<S> ( e ) the coherence decay curves of the hahn echo and cpmg - n of a n from 2 to 16 . </S>",
    "<S> the coherence time of the cpmg-16 was 110.8 @xmath0 , which was ten times longer than that for spin echo ( 10.5 @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( f ) the comparison of the coherence time of the tcpmg - n and cpmg-2n for the same number n. both were linearly increasing with n. the blue and red points at n=0 denoted the results for spin echo and te , respectively . ]    for the te ( figure [ figure 1](f ) ) and tcpmg - n experiments ( figure [ figure 2](a ) ) , the working principles are similar to that of the t - ramsey experiment .@xcite the key difference between te and tcpmg - n is that the tcpmg - n experiments invert the spin more frequently ( 2n times ) and hence more effectively eliminate higher frequency magnetic noise , thus can extend the spin coherence time for thermometry.@xcite by fitting the experimental resultsof the te and tcpmg - n to the eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) , the coherence times for thermometry were derived . </S>",
    "<S> the coherence time of the te measurement was 9.5 @xmath0 , which was close to a value of 10.5 @xmath0 obtained from the spin echo experiment@xcite ( figure [ figure 2](e ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the tcpmg-1 ( figure [ figure 2](b ) ) and tcpmg-8 ( figure [ figure 2](c ) ) experiments extended the coherence time to 14.9 @xmath0 and 107.8 @xmath0 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the coherence time of tcpmg-8 was about fifteen times longer than that of the t - ramsey . </S>",
    "<S> utilizing the obtained experimental data , the corresponding thermal sensitivity of the nv center @xmath4 can be derived from the following equation@xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the photon counts per measurement shot for the bright and dark spin states , respectively . in the experiments , we used the oil objective ( na = 1.4 ) and the obtained @xmath53 and @xmath54 values were about 0.029 and 0.02 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thus derived thermal sensitivity @xmath4 of the tcpmg-8 was 10.1 mk / hz@xmath1 , which was comparable with that of the native nv center in isotopically pure diamond.@xcite    furthermore , the tcpmg method was compared with the conventional cpmg method . in the cpmg - n experiments , as illustrated in figure [ figure 2](d ) , the microwave pulse phases of the beginning @xmath55 and the final @xmath56 pulses were y phases , while the phases of the echo pulses @xmath47 were x phases.@xcite the coherence times obtained in the cpmg - n experiments were increasing with the @xmath30 pulse number n , and , in particular , the @xmath57 of the cpmg-16 was 110.8 @xmath0 , about ten times longer than the value 10.5 @xmath0 for the hahn echo . </S>",
    "<S> considering the fact that there are two triple @xmath30 pulses in a period of tcpmg , it would be more reasonable to compare tcpmg - n with cpmg-2n . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ figure 2](f ) showed the obtained dependence of the coherence times for these two methods with the number n. it was found that in both cases the coherence times increased almost linearly with n. this phenomenon of the cpmg was similar to that for the native nv center in high - purity diamond,@xcite but different from the @xmath58 dependence in low - purity diamond.@xcite it was also noted that the coherence times of tcpmg - n were a little shorter than that in the cpmg-2n , which might be caused by the pulse imperfections , including pulse length , frequency imperfection , and power fluctuation , since the tcpmg sequences were composed with more microwave pulses .     </S>",
    "<S> was the oscillation frequency in a case without heating , and @xmath59 was the oscillation frequency with heating . </S>",
    "<S> for all the tcpmg-3 experiments , each data point with @xmath60 averages . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement time per point was about 9 s , and total time was about 10 minutes . ]    </S>",
    "<S> then , we discussed , in more detail , the temperature detection through measuring the changes in the @xmath24 oscillation frequency by applying tcpmg-3 on implanted nv centers . in figure [ figure 3](a ) , the upper part showed the pulse sequence of tcpmg-3 and the bottom part showed the results of the tcpmg-3 measurement on a nv center . the coherence time and the oscillation frequency , obtained from fitting the results to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) , were 159.0 @xmath61 1.0 khz and 35.9 @xmath61 1.2 @xmath0 , respectively . in the experiments </S>",
    "<S> , we used the dry objective ( na = 0.9 ) and the obtained @xmath53 and @xmath54 values were 0.022 and 0.017 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding thermal sensitivity @xmath4 was derived from eq.(3 ) to be 24 mk / hz@xmath1 , which was about 6 times improvement in comparison with that for the single nv center nanodiamonds.@xcite furthermore , the relation between the change of the @xmath24 oscillation frequency and the microwave frequency detunings was examined . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3(b , c , d ) showed the results for the sample both with and without heating , obtained under three different detunings but the same heating condition . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in figure 3(b ) and 3(c ) , the changes of @xmath24 oscillation frequency @xmath43 of the two different positive detunings ( both of the microwave carrier frequencies were larger than the corresponding resonance frequencies ) , were 42.1@xmath612.5 khz and 39.9@xmath612.6khz , respectively , while for the negative detuning ( both of the microwave carrier frequencies were less than the corresponding resonance frequencies ) , it was 40.8@xmath612.4 khz ( see figure 3(d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> it could be seen that the changes of the oscillation frequency @xmath43 were nearly the same . </S>",
    "<S> this result indicated that the change in oscillation frequency depends only on the change in temperature , regardless of the microwave frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> this was consistent with the theory described by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) . using the standard error derived from the fitting </S>",
    "<S> , we estimated that the temperature precision was about 34 mk .        to demonstrate detection of temperature distribution , </S>",
    "<S> the implanted nv center array in the surface layer of a diamond chip was used , with which the corresponding local temperatures were measured using tcpmg-3 . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ figure 4](a ) shows the confocal microscope fluorescence image of an area of the sample with an implanted single nv center array in its surface layer . </S>",
    "<S> the nearest separation of two nv centers was 2 @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the larger bright specks in the image were nv center clusters formed during the implantation due to imperfect pmma templet layer deposited on the diamond chip . </S>",
    "<S> the sample was equipped with a nichrome wire heater , which was situated above the diamond surface ( figure 1(a ) ) and arranged parallel to the y axis . </S>",
    "<S> five single nv centers ( named nv - a@xmath3e in figure 4(a ) ) with their axes parallel to the external magnetic field were selected to detect the local temperatures in the diamond surface layer . </S>",
    "<S> for all the five nv centers , the coherence time of the tcpmg-3 were about 35 @xmath0 . in the experiment </S>",
    "<S> the sample was situated in air or in oil ( nikon microscope immersion oil ) . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we detected the temperatures at four positions in the surface layer of the diamond chip in air ( nichrome wire was placed 15 @xmath9 above the surface of the diamond chip ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ figure 4 ] ( b ) showed the local temperatures detected by the nv - d ( 273 @xmath9 away from the nichrome wire ) at various dc heating powers . </S>",
    "<S> it could be seen that the temperature increased sharply at the beginning when the heating power was low , then linearly increased as the dc heating power increased . </S>",
    "<S> the sharp increase at the beginning might be due to that the heat dissipation to the environment was less remarkable as the temperature difference between the sample and the surroundings was small at low heating power . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , as shown in figure [ figure 4](c ) , under each dc heating power , the temperatures measured via four nv centers located at different distances from the nichrome wire were almost the same , even for an nv center 100 @xmath9 away from the nichrome wire . </S>",
    "<S> this result can be ascribed to the high thermal conductivity @xmath62 of the diamond ( about 2000 w / mk ) . </S>",
    "<S> the similar result was obtained by using the same nv - d ( 289 @xmath9 away from the nichrome wire , nichrome wire 23 @xmath9 above the surface of the diamond chip ) with the diamond chip in oil ( red points in figure [ figure 4](d ) ) , except that the rate of the temperature variation for sample in oil was less than that in air ( green points ) . </S>",
    "<S> the temperatures of the five single nv centers at different distances from the nichrome wire for the sample in oil ( figure [ figure 4](e ) ) were also almost the same under the same dc powers , similar to the case of the sample in air .    </S>",

    "<S> the blue line was the fitting of the experimental data . ]    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we detected the temperature distribution on the surface layer of the sample in air , but with a heat sink added on the other side of the sample ( figure 5 ( a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the heat sink , a copper wire , was in thermally contacted with a stable heat bath of a temperature 0 . </S>",
    "<S> the nichrome heating wire was 20 @xmath9 above the surface of the diamond chip . </S>",
    "<S> to detect the temperature distribution on the sample surface , nine single nv centers ( named nv - a@xmath3i , as shown in supporting information fig 3 and fig 4 ) were selected to detect the temperatures at the corresponding local positions . </S>",
    "<S> the axes of all the nine nv centers were parallel to the magnetic field and the coherence times measured with tcpmg-3 for these centers were about 35 @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 5(b ) presented a typical dc power dependence of the temperature recorded by nv - e ( 76 @xmath9 away from the nichrome wire ) , showing a relationship similar to that for sample without the heat sink . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , figure [ figure 5](c ) showed the temperatures measured by using four single nv centers , nv - a@xmath3d , that were located at about the same distance ( about 96 @xmath9 ) away from the nichrome wire from the nichrome wire with a dc heating power of 20.66 mw . </S>",
    "<S> obviously the temperatures were almost the same , which was in accordance with the geometry of these nv centers : the same distance from the heating wire . </S>",
    "<S> however , as shown in figure 5(d ) , the temperatures varied along the perpendicular direction , as represented by temperatures of the five single nv centers , nv - e@xmath3i , at different distances to the nichrome wire that was heated with a dc power of 21.15 mw . according to the steady - state heat conduction equation </S>",
    "<S> , the temperature profile on the diamond surface layer follows the expression @xmath63 , where a , b are free parameters , @xmath64 is the heat flux , and @xmath62 is the thermal conductivity of diamond and r is the distance between the nv center and the nichrome wire . it can be seen from the figure that the experimental data was fitted very well with the expression . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments showed the effectiveness of the tcpmg method for high - sensitivity temperature detection when performed on the implanted nv centers in high - purity diamond .    in summary , we studied thermometry based on the implanted single nitrogen vacancy ( nv ) center in diamond by using the tcpmg method in a static magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> it was demonstrated that the spin coherence time for thermometry was extended up to 108 @xmath0 for tcpmg-8 , which was around 14 times of the value for t - ramsey method ( 7.7 @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this value corresponds to a thermal sensitivity 10.1 mk / hz@xmath1 , which was comparable with that for the isotopically pure diamond.@xcite we measured the temperature distributions on the diamond chip surface in three different circumstances using the tcpmg-3 pulse sequence on the implanted nv center array . </S>",
    "<S> the achieved thermal sensitivity was 24 mk / hz@xmath1 , which was about 6 times improvement in comparison with that for the single nv center nanodiamonds.@xcite the experiment implies the feasibility for using implanted nv centers in high - quality diamonds to detect temperatures with high - sensitivity .    </S>",
    "<S> it is expectable that using higher order tcpmg , isotopically pure diamond and technique of higher photon collection efficiency , such as solid immersion lenses,@xcite the thermal sensitivity can be further improved to submk / hz@xmath1 . combining the tcpmg method and the implanted nv center in high - purity nanodiamonds,@xcite high performance temperature sensors with higher precision , nanoscale spatial resolution , outstanding sensor photostability and chemical inertness can be constructed , which can be applied to nanoscale temperature detection in a wide variety of systems , including biology,@xcite chemistry , material science and microelectronics systems . </S>",
    "<S> the tcpmg thermometry could also be applied to other solid - state quantum spin systems such as point defects in silicon carbide@xcite for temperature sensing . </S>"
