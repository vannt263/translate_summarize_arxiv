    "galaxy mass is probably the most important parameter among those governing the evolution of galaxies .",

    "* ) . in cold dark matter ( cdm ) universes , dark haloes",
    "grow with time through merging of less massive haloes , implying that haloes with different masses have different evolutionary histories .",
    "observing galaxies over a wide mass range is thus crucial to place strong constraints on galaxy evolution .",
    "it is extremely difficult to measure dark - halo masses of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "one can , however , _ infer _ them from galaxy clustering on the assumption that galaxies reside in dark haloes , since cdm models predict a monotonic correlation that more massive haloes are clustered more strongly @xcite .",
    "measuring galaxy clustering requires a large sample from a wide area .",
    "recent observations suggest that the era of @xmath13 is important in galaxy evolution for various reasons ; the cosmic star formation rate begins to drop at @xmath15  2 from a flat plateau at higher redshifts @xcite ; the morphological type mix of field galaxies changes remarkably at @xmath15  2 @xcite ; the number density of qsos has a peak at @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "various color selection methods such as the lyman - break technique @xcite have been proposed so far , in order to construct large samples of galaxies at high redshifts from imaging data . however , color selections for galaxies at @xmath13 , the redshift desert , have not been as successful as those for other redshifts , mainly because of the lack of distinctive spectral features in the optical wavelength .",
    "recently , a two - color selection with @xmath16 and @xmath17 has been proposed by @xcite to select galaxies at @xmath2 effectively with a low contamination .",
    "galaxies selected with this method , referred to as bzks , make up a good approximation of a sample of all galaxies at @xmath13 down to a limiting magnitude in the @xmath9 band , roughly equal to a stellar mass limit .",
    "two types of bzks , sbzks and pbzks , are defined according to the position in the @xmath16 vs @xmath17 space @xcite ; s and p denote star - forming and passive , respectively . it has been shown that most star - forming galaxies at @xmath2 meet the criteria for sbzks irrespective of the amount of dust extinction @xcite .",
    "previous observations of bzks have been limited primarily to bright objects with @xmath18 .",

    "data reduction was made in the standard manner for nir imaging data , but special care was taken to exclude spurious objects due to crosstalk of bright objects .",
    "all the images , except the one with the worst seeing size , were smoothed with a gaussian kernel so that their psf sizes be @xmath42 fwhm .",
    "the 2mass catalog @xcite was used to conduct astrometry and to derive the magnitude zero point .",
    "we measure the @xmath51 limiting magnitude on a @xmath41-diameter aperture for each detector .",

    "clustering analysis requires high uniformity in object detection over the image for all passbands , since a variation in detection completeness may produce spurious clustering signals .",
    "while the wfcam @xmath43 and @xmath9 images are very uniform , sky noise at the four edges of the suprime - cam images is systematically large and non - uniform because of dithered pointing with large angles .",
    "we examine detection uniformity for each of the four overlapping fields by dividing the field into a few dozen of sub - areas and estimating the sky noise in each sub - area for @xmath36 , @xmath39 , and @xmath9 . on the basis of these noise maps , we find that the two subregions surrounded by thick solid lines in figure [ sdf ] have a good detection uniformity in all three passbands .",
    "these subregions are well within the good @xmath57 area defined in @xcite . in what follows we call these two subregions the nw and sw subregions .",
    "the area of nw and sw subregions are 100 arcmin@xmath1 and 80 arcmin@xmath1 , respectively .    in this paper , we examine angular clustering only in the nw and sw subregions . among the 8884 objects found in the four overlapping fields , 3961",

    "although the validity of the @xmath0 selection for objects fainter than @xmath62 has not been examined well , we assume that the selection and the classification into two types are applicable to our objects as well .    in the selection of bzks , special care is required for objects undetected in @xmath36 or @xmath39 , i.e. , @xmath63 or @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the @xmath52 limiting magnitudes .",

    "our @xmath36 , @xmath39 , and @xmath9 bandpasses are not exactly the same as those originally used to define the bzk selection criteria in @xcite .",
    "we use @xcite s stellar spectrophotometric atlas to find that the @xmath16 colors of stars defined in our system can be bluer than those in @xcite up to 0.2 mag , depending on the spectral type , while there is little difference in @xmath17 .",
    "we also make a similar evaluation using the spectral templates of local galaxies ( e to i m ) given in @xcite redshifted to @xmath13 .",
    "it is found that the @xmath16 colors of these galaxies in our system are at most 0.1 mag bluer than those in @xcite while our @xmath17 colors are at most 0.1 mag redder .",
    "these results imply that applying the original sbzk boundary , @xmath72 , to our data will select additional objects near the boundary which , if measured in the system of @xcite , may not be selected .",
    "our sbzk sample will be reduced by @xmath73 % when the selection boundary is tightened by @xmath74 mag ( i.e. , @xmath75 ) .",
    "this reduction should be an upper limit to the effect of the bandpass differences , since the net offset in the @xmath16 vs @xmath17 plane of sbzks due to the bandpass differences will be on average more modest than @xmath74 mag .",
    "because this reduced sample gives a very similar acf , we have decided not to adjust the selection boundary in our study .",
    "we find that the @xmath41-aperture @xmath9 magnitudes of our bzks are on average 0.3 mag fainter than the total magnitudes ( we adopt mag_auto magnitudes for total magnitudes ) .",
    "for this reason , we regard that our bzk sample is flux - limited to a total magnitude of @xmath76 .",

    "s data are from two wide fields , eis deep3a field and daddi field , we plot the counts from these two fields separately .",
    "it is found that our number counts of sbzks and all galaxies are consistent with those of k06 while pbzk are lower by a factor of 2 - 3 .",
    "this disagreement in the number counts of pbzk may be partly due to cosmic variance .",
    "indeed , even in the two fields surveyed by k06 , both of which are several times larger than our total area , the counts are different significantly .",
    "a small part of the disagreement may also result from our special treatment in the @xmath0 selection for objects undetected in @xmath36 or @xmath39 described in section [ subsec;selection_bzk ] , which has not been considered in k06 .",
    "we derive the angular correlation function ( acf ) separately for the sbzks and pbzks .",
    "we do not , however , show the results of the pbzks , since reliable measurements are not obtained due to their small sample size ( 56 objects ) .",
    "we first measure the acf of sbzks for the nw and sw subregions independently with angular bins of @xmath77 = 0.4 $ ] , using the estimator given in @xcite .",
    "random data with 50000 points are used .",
    "errors in the measurements are estimated by the bootstrap resampling method @xcite .",
    "then the measurements for each subregion are corrected for the integral constraint , on the assumption that the true acf obeys a power law of @xmath78 .",
    "finally , the measurements from the two subregions are averaged to obtain the acf of sbzks in the sdf ( figure [ acf ] ) .",
    "the amplitude of the acf , @xmath79 , is obtained from a fit of @xmath80 to the data , and is given in table [ count_etc ] .",
    "our sbzks have @xmath81 [ arcsec@xmath82 , where the errors correspond to the range in which the increase in @xmath83 from the best - fit value is less than unity .",
    "our acf measurement for sbzks could suffer from cosmic variance , since each of the two sub - fields is only about 10 mpc a side at @xmath84 .",
    "a survey of a larger area is clearly required to obtain results robust against possible variance .",
    "however , we infer that the amplitude of the cosmic variance in our sample will not be intolerably large , since the acfs from the two sub - fields agree within the statistical errors , and since the number counts of our sbzks are consistent with those of k06 .",
    "figure [ aw_k ] shows the observed acf amplitude against limiting @xmath9 magnitude .",
    "the filled circle represents the amplitude of our sbzks , while the six filled triangles correspond to the amplitudes for the six samples of k06 with different limiting magnitudes over @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the acf amplitude of sbzks is found to decrease rapidly with decreasing @xmath9 brightness .",
    "the brightest samples of k06 have @xmath87  20 arcsec@xmath88 , which is about 30 times higher than ours .    in the next subsection , the spatial correlation lengths , @xmath89 ,",
    "are calculated from the acf amplitudes to discuss the clustering of sbzks in real space . for the reader s reference ,",
    "the three shaded regions in figure [ aw_k ] indicate , respectively , the expected acf amplitude for @xmath89 = 3 , 10 and 20 [ @xmath90 calculated using the redshift distribution for sbzks adopted in the next subsection ( gaussian with @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) ; for each @xmath89 , the spread in amplitude corresponds to the adopted uncertainty in the @xmath93 of @xmath94 .",
    "the correlation length , @xmath89 , for sbzks can be calculated from the amplitude of the acf , @xmath79 , using limber s equation @xcite if their redshift distribution is known .",
    "the redshift distribution , @xmath95 , of sbzks has not been established even for bright objects with @xmath96 owing to the lack of a large , flux - limited spectroscopic sample . in this study , we assume that the @xmath95 of sbzks is not dependent on @xmath9 magnitude , and adopt a gaussian distribution as a simple approximation .",
    "we determine the central redshift , @xmath97 , and the standard deviation , @xmath93 , of the gaussian as follows .",
    "first , we use a preliminary result of the @xmath95 of sbzks ( 81 objects , most of which are @xmath98 ) obtained from a @xmath9-selected spectroscopic survey in the eis deep3a field with vlt / vimos down to @xmath99 ( e. daddi , private communication ) to determine @xmath97 and infer @xmath93 .",
    "this is probably the most reliable measurement of the @xmath95 of sbzks at present because it is based on the largest spectroscopic sample .",
    "we fit a gaussian to this @xmath95 after removing a strong spike at @xmath100 ( which could be due to large - scale structure ) and limiting the redshift range to @xmath101 , and obtain @xmath97 = 1.9 and @xmath93 = 0.4 . from this result",
    ", we adopt @xmath97 = 1.9 for our gaussian distribution .",
    "note that the limber transformation is insensitive to the change in @xmath97 ; for example , changing @xmath97 by @xmath102 around 1.9 changes @xmath89 only by 2.5 % .",
    "next , we determine @xmath93 and express the uncertainty in our gaussian distribution by the range of @xmath93 .",
    "we adopt @xmath103 for the following reasons .",
    "we find that , for a fixed @xmath79 value , the range of @xmath89 corresponding to the range @xmath104 covers not only the @xmath89 value calculated using the raw @xmath95 from the eis deep3a field , but also from those given in @xcite and @xcite . here , the data of @xcite are another measurement of the redshift distribution based on a large sample , although the sample is not @xmath9-limited but optically selected and thus could be biased toward uv bright objects .",
    "we also find that the best - fit gaussian parameters for the redshift distribution data of @xcite and @xcite are similar to the values we adopt above .",
    "figure [ selection_func ] compares the adopted gaussian function with the @xmath95 of @xcite .",
    "it is true that a gaussian distribution is not an excellent approximation to the existing @xmath95 data , especially for the preliminary result of daddi et al .",
    "( private communication ) with a large spike .",
    "however , it will be reasonable to expect that the true @xmath95 derived from a sample large enough to smooth out statistical noise and cosmic variance is not so far from a gaussian centered at @xmath13 , since the isolation of @xmath105 galaxies from others using the bzk selection will not be perfect",
    ". it may be worth noting that lyman - break galaxies , which are also selected in a two - color plane , are known to have a gaussian - like distribution @xcite .",
    "our purpose is not to infer the true distribution but to find a reasonable expression of it which can be used in the limber transformation . in this sense ,",
    "the adopted gaussian and uncertainty , @xmath91 and @xmath106 , are a reasonable parameterization , since they include all the variations in the existing redshift distribution measurements in terms of resultant @xmath89 values .",
    "it is also found that the @xmath89 value calculated using a top - hat redshift distribution of @xmath107 ( ideal selection function for bzks ) falls within the @xmath89 range defined by the adopted uncertainty in the gaussian .",
    "finally , we should note that our assumption that the @xmath95 does not depend on @xmath9 magnitude must be tested using a future spectroscopic follow - up , although the observation of @xcite may support this assumption .",
    "they derived @xmath95 for @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( with a limiting magnitude of @xmath110 ) separately , which are found not to be largely different .",

    "we estimate the minimum stellar mass , which corresponds to that of the faintest galaxies in the sample , for our sample and the six samples of k06 from the @xmath9 magnitude and @xmath17 color of the faintest object in each sample , using equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) given in @xcite .",
    "these equations were derived using bright sbzks which have accurate stellar masses based on a fit of model spectra to multicolor data .",
    "@xcite found the typical error in mass estimates from these equations to be @xmath153 .",
    "figure [ stellar_mass ] plots the minimum stellar mass of sbzks against the minimum mass of their hosting haloes .",
    "the minimum stellar mass of our sample is @xmath154 , while those of k06 are three to ten times higher . on the other hand ,",
    "the minimum dark - halo mass of our sample is @xmath155 , while those of k06 are two to three orders of magnitude higher .",
    "it is thus concluded that dark - halo mass increases more rapidly than the stellar mass of individual sbzks residing in the halo .",
    "we note that the stellar - mass estimation for our sample is less reliable than that for k06 .",
    "equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) in @xcite have not been tested for faint sbzks like those in our sample , which may have systematically different stellar populations and dust extinctions .",
    "the observed trend of increasing @xmath156 with @xmath157 will disappear if the @xmath157 of our sample is overestimated by more than factor ten , although such a large overestimation seems to be unlikely .",
    "the halo occupation number of a given class of galaxies is defined as the average number of this class of galaxies hosted in a single dark halo .",
    "we estimate the halo occupation number of sbzks for two magnitude limits , @xmath27 and @xmath158 , using our sample and the faintest sample of k06 , and then examine whether or not occupation number depends on luminosity .    the halo occupation number for sbzks with @xmath159",
    "is estimated by dividing the number density of our sbzks by that of dark haloes hosting them , i.e. , haloes more massive than @xmath115 .",
    "we have 1092 objects in a survey volume of @xmath160 .",
    "this leads to a number density of @xmath161 mpc@xmath162 after correction for detection completeness of a modest amount .",
    "the number density of dark haloes is calculated to be @xmath163 from the analytic formula of the halo mass function given by @xcite .",
    "thus , the halo occupation number of sbzks with @xmath27 is estimated to be @xmath164 .",
    "similarly , we use the faintest sample of k06 with @xmath158 to estimate the halo occupation number to be @xmath165 . here , the number of sbzks in this sample is 387 , the survey volume is @xmath166 , and the number density of the hosting haloes is @xmath167 .",
    "these two estimates show that the occupation number of sbzks increases strongly with increasing halo mass .",
    "haloes with @xmath168 have several sbzks on average , while only one tenth ( on average ) of haloes with @xmath169 host an sbzk .",
    "it is reasonable that haloes with @xmath170 host multiple sbzks , since they are as massive as present - day groups and clusters of galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "the very small occupation number for haloes with @xmath171 may imply that they are not massive enough to always feed a galaxy more luminous than @xmath159 .",
    "figure [ r0_z ] compares the correlation lengths of sbzks with those of various types of objects from present - day early - type galaxies and clusters of galaxies , up to galaxies at @xmath172 .",
    "the five curves show the correlation lengths of dark haloes with five fixed @xmath115 values as a function of redshift .",
    "haloes with a fixed minimum mass have larger @xmath89 at higher @xmath173 because @xmath174 increases with @xmath173 for any @xmath145 .    it is found from figure [ r0_z ] that at @xmath13 faint ( @xmath27 ) sbzks and bx / bm galaxies have similar correlation lengths and thus similar dark - halo masses of the order of @xmath175 . this result is in accord with the recent claim by @xcite that a high fraction ( @xmath176  @xmath177 ) of bxs / bms with @xmath178 are also selected as sbzks and that the fraction increases with decreasing @xmath9 brightness .",
    "therefore , faint sbzks and bxs / bms are largely overlapping subsets of star - forming galaxies at @xmath13 hosted by relatively low - mass haloes . in figure",
    "[ r0_z ] , lbgs at @xmath179  4 have also similar masses to faint sbzks , while haloes hosting qsos are on average an order of magnitude more massive .    brighter sbzks with @xmath180 ",
    "@xmath181 are found to have as large correlation lengths , @xmath182 ",
    "15 @xmath7 mpc , as drgs at @xmath13  3 and eros at @xmath15  2 .",
    "they are located in haloes as massive as the order of @xmath183 .",
    "their correlation lengths partly overlap with those of present - day luminous early - type galaxies and clusters .",
    "large fractions of drgs and eros are known to be passive galaxies , while sbzks are star - forming galaxies .",
    "this implies that haloes with similar masses can host galaxies with extremely different star - formation properties .",
    "brightest sbzks with @xmath184 are most strongly clustered among the high-@xmath173 populations plotted here .",
    "their correlation lengths are comparable to or even larger than those of present - day rich clusters .",
    "we use the extended press - schechter formalism @xcite to predict the mass of the present - day descendants of dark haloes hosting sbzks at @xmath13 .",
    "we find that haloes at @xmath84 with a mass equal to the @xmath113 of faint ( @xmath27 ) sbzks ( @xmath8 ) will become haloes with masses of @xmath185 at @xmath186 ( @xmath187 range of the distribution function ; the extended press - schechter formalism can predict descendant masses only in a statistical sense ) .",
    "thus , the present - day descendants of the typical haloes of faint sbzks are likely to be less massive than that of the milky way",
    ". they may host sub-@xmath188 galaxies in nearby fields . on the basis of a clustering analysis of bx / bm galaxies ,",
    "@xcite concluded that bxs / bms are progenitors of normal ellipticals in the local universe .",
    "the correlation length they obtained is @xmath189 @xmath7mpc for bxs and @xmath190 @xmath7mpc for bms .",
    "these values correspond to dark haloes several times more massive than those of our faint sbzks .",
    "thus , their conclusion does not seem to conflict with our result obtained here .",
    "on the other hand , haloes with a mass equal to the @xmath113 of @xmath191 sbzks in k06 ( @xmath192 ) are predicted to have @xmath193 at present .",
    "these masses are comparable to those of most massive clusters like coma .",
    "the number density of sbzks with @xmath191 , @xmath194 , is close to that of the present - day rich clusters more massive than @xmath195 , @xmath196 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that brightest sbzks are ancestors of central galaxies in rich clusters seen at present .",
    "these calculations suggest that sbzks evolve into galaxies over a wide range of mass ( or luminosity ) in a variety of environment at @xmath186 , depending on their apparent @xmath9 brightness .",
    "in this paper , we have studied clustering properties of star - forming bzk galaxies ( sbzks ) at @xmath2 over a wide range of @xmath9 brightness ( @xmath27 ) .    we have used deep multi - color data of 180 arcmin@xmath1 in the subaru deep field to construct a sample of 1092 faint ( @xmath27 ) sbzk galaxies .",
    "we have derived the angular correlation function ( acf ) of the sbzks , and measured its amplitude to be @xmath197 [ arcsec@xmath82 by fitting a power law of @xmath198 to the data .",
    "we have then transformed the acf amplitude into the correlation length assuming a gaussian redshift distribution of @xmath199 and @xmath103 , and obtained @xmath6 @xmath7 mpc .",
    "we have not been able to derive the acf of passive bzks in our data because of the small sample size .",
    "we infer from the correlation length that our sbzks reside in haloes with an average mass of @xmath8 and a minimum mass of @xmath200 .",
    "we then have inferred dark - halo masses for six bright ( @xmath158 ) sbzk samples of k06 in the same manner . combining our data with those of k06 ,",
    "we have examined how the mass of hosting dark haloes depends on the @xmath9 luminosity of sbzks .",
    "we have found that the mass of dark haloes rapidly increases with @xmath9 brightness of individual sbzks ; k06 s sbzks are brighter than ours by only up to @xmath11 times , but they are hosted by haloes two to three orders of magnitude more massive than the haloes of our sbzks . the halo occupation number , the number of bzks hosted in a dark halo , is found to be higher for brighter sbzks .",
    "the correlation lengths of sbzks have been compared with those of various types of objects up to @xmath201 .",
    "we have found that faint ( @xmath27 ) sbzks have similar @xmath89 values to bx / bm galaxies , which are optically - selected star - forming galaxies at @xmath13 .",
    "we argue that these two types of galaxies are similar populations hosted by relatively low - mass haloes with the order of @xmath202 . on the other hand , sbzks with @xmath203 , eros , and drgs",
    "are found to reside in massive haloes with the order of @xmath204 .",
    "the clustering of brightest sbzks with @xmath184 is the strongest among the high-@xmath173 populations .",
    "finally , we have predicted present - day descendants of haloes hosting sbzks using the extended press - schechter formalism .",
    "descendants are found to span a wide range of mass , depending on the @xmath9 brightness of sbzks in them .",
    "typical descendants of haloes hosting sbzks with @xmath27 are less massive than the milky way , while those for @xmath205 sbzks are as massive as richest clusters .",
    "we wish to thank takashi hamana for providing his code to compute the mass growth of dark haloes using the extended press - schechter formalism .",
    "we are very grateful to emanuele daddi for kindly providing new data of the redshift distribution of 81 sbzks prior to publication .",
