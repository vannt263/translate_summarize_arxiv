    "@xcite the cylinder and torus geometries are exceptional in this sense , and allow for a direct check of these ideas in microscopic models , either through an exact solution or by means of numerical computations .",
    "we now generalize the application of eq . to the computation of the entanglement",
    "entropy to more general case of conformal qcps , specifically those associated whose wave functions have an associated 2d euclidean rcft ( a cft with a finite number of primary fields . )      the ground state wave function for a conformal quantum critical point can be expressed as gibbs weight associated with a 2d euclidean cft : @xmath39=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{z } } e^{\\displaystyle{-s[\\phi]/2}}\\ ] ] as in the case of the qlm discussed in the previous section .",

    "furthermore , we will also assume that the associated euclidean cft is _ unitary _ ( the @xmath29-matrix to be defined below is unitary ) and that it is a _ rcft_. the restriction to unitary rcft allows us to exploit well developed technology for this large class of cfts@xcite , especially that of operator product expansion ( ope ) and of _ modular s - martirx _ , in calculation of @xmath23 .",

    "this case is interesting for several reasons .",
    "one is that strong arguments@xcite suggest that it is possible to define for this wave function an excitation ( a defect ) which is denoted by @xmath31 , a fibonacci anyon ( not to be confused with the modular parameter ! ) with the fusion rule , @xmath275 .",
    "fibonacci anyons are of prime interest in the topological approach to quantum computation.@xcite however , for this approach to work it is necessary that this state should describe a topological state , which requires that its local excitations ( not the nets ) be gapped .",
    "fendley@xcite has recently given strong arguments that imply that this state , with the naive inner product we use here , is not topological but a quantum critical state .",
    "another feature that makes this state interesting is that the correlations encoded in the norm of the state for @xmath273 are described by a rcft , the minimal model of the friedan - qiu - shenker@xcite series of unitary rcfts at level @xmath276 , with central charge @xmath277 .",
    "this minimal model has a large number of primaries ( 36 ) and has not been studied in detail .",
    "nevertheless , its modular @xmath29-matrix is known ( as it is for the entire series@xcite ) .",
    "although to the best of our knowledge the boundary cft of this minimal model has not been investigated , we conjecture that the boundary state corresponding to the fixed boundary condition is the analog of the state @xmath278 in the 2d critical ising model ( the @xmath279 member of the same series . )",
    ", _ i.e. _ the state in the conformal block of the identity.@xcite thus , if we consider this state on a cylinder with fixed boundary conditions , the entanglement entropy for observing only half of the system , has a universal term @xmath23 of the form given in eq . , and",
    "hence is given in terms of the @xmath210 element of the modular @xmath29-matrix of this rcft:@xcite @xmath280",
    "we have shown that at 2d conformal qcps ( with dynamical exponent @xmath36 ) , the entanglement entropy for a region with a smooth boundary quite generally has universal finite contributions which we denoted by @xmath23 : @xmath281 we studied the universal nature of @xmath23 with two complementary approaches for large classes of 2d conformal qcps : first for the qlm universality class , we calculated @xmath23 explicitly in terms of the partition functions ( that of compactified boson ) associated with the norm squared of the wave function .",
    "later we used known results from boundary cft to show that @xmath23 is determined by the detailed structure of the associated rcft encoded in the modular @xmath29-matrix and the ope fusion coefficients for the primary fields .",
    "we also applied this general results to compute @xmath23 in several systems of interest : the quantum lifshitz model , the generalized quantum dimer and quantum eight - vertex models , and quantum loop and net models .",

    "thus , the modular @xmath29-matrix of the topological phase and that of the wave functions of 2d conformal quantum critical points have a conceptually different origin .",
    "we note that while our result for the entanglement entropy has the _ same form _ as the entanglement entropy for a _ topological phase _ , @xcite the finite universal terms @xmath23 and @xmath27 have a different origin and structure . in the case of a topological phase , @xmath27 is in general determined by the modular @xmath29-matrix of the topological field theory of the topological phase , and it is given in terms of topological invariants of the effective topological field theory that describes this phase.@xcite this modular @xmath29-matrix governs the transformation properties of the ground state within the degenerate ground state hilbert space of the topological phase under modular transformations on a torus : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the modular parameter of the torus@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for 2d conformal qcps whose ground state wave function is given by the gibbs weights of a euclidean rational unitary cft , the universal term @xmath23 is determined by the modular @xmath29-matrix associated with the norm squared of the wave function and the @xmath29-matrix connects between different boundary conditions .",
    "hence the roles of the modular @xmath29-matrix in the computation of the universal @xmath126 terms to the entanglement entropy have conceptually different origin .",
    "moreover , @xmath23 and @xmath282 enter with opposite signs in their contributions to their respective entanglement entropies .",
    "in fact , in all the cases we looked at we found that @xmath283 , except for the kitaev state which is topological , and we recovered the known result .",
    "( it is unclear to us how general this difference actually is and , more importantly , if it has a deeper meaning . ) in any case , the fact that the entanglement entropy has the universal form of eq . has led to the widespread assumption that this scaling is a signature of a topological phase .",
    "however we have shown here that this is not necessarily the case as this scaling is also obeyed at conformal quantum critical points in 2d .",
    "it is also interesting to note the striking similarity of the structure of eq .",
    "( with its dependence on the @xmath29-matrix and the fusion rules ) with the results of fendley , fisher and nayak@xcite for the change in the entanglement entropy of a 2d topological fluid , a fractional quantum hall state , by the action of a point contact .",

    "calculations of quantum fidelity in 1d also find a similar structure.@xcite recent work by li and haldane@xcite also raises the interesting possibility of computing the entanglement spectrum for a theory with a wave function described by a known cft , but this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "finally , given the close connection between the universal piece of the entanglement entropy @xmath23 and the affleck - ludwig entropy of the associated 2d classical partition functions it is interesting to inquire if @xmath23 may flow under some perturbation .",
