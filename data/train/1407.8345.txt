    "<S> consequently , at weak disorder @xmath24 the localization length @xmath25 of an eigenstate @xmath26 scales as @xmath27 away from @xmath0 , and as @xmath28 at @xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> this is because the disorder is uncorrelated , so it performs both energy renormalization and hybridizaton with dispersive states at the same time .    </S>",
    "<S> a drastic change occurs when the potential is correlated such that energy renormalization no longer occurs , i.e. @xmath31 , which leads to @xmath32 ( easily implemented with microwave resonator networks  @xcite ) . </S>",

    "<S> first we note that the obtained states have positive @xmath35 , which means that they must occur on the larger energy side of the fb energy . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the density of states @xmath63 follows  @xcite from the pdf @xmath64 of the random number @xmath65 as @xmath66 the divergence is now strengthened to a square root one , but only on the high energy side of the fb energy . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dos ] , we indeed confirm this singularity numerically on the right hand side of the fb energy . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile on the left hand side , we instead observe a vanishing density of states . </S>",
    "<S> it should be also noted that we observe a gap developing as @xmath67 increases beyond a critical @xmath68 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this issue warrants further investigation , and may be related to disorder - induced crossing resonances @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ mobility edges  _ since the localization length is forced to vanish at the fb energy by correlated disorder in a one - dimensional system , it can be expected that a system with a metal - insulator transition will even have a singularity in the mobility edge , i.e. the dependence of the critical potential strength on the eigenstate energy . </S>",
    "<S> mobility edges typically appear for three - dimensional disordered systems , however a quasiperiodic potential is known to produce a metal - insulator transition already in one space dimension . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a tight - binding chain with eigenvalue problem @xmath69 is the well - known aubry - andr model which has a metal - insulator transition at @xmath70 , provided @xmath71 is an irrational number  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath72 does not depend on the eigenenergy , therefore the mobility edge function is a constant in the aubry - andr case . </S>",
    "<S> in general , deviations from the aubry - andr quasiperiodic case into other quasiperiodic potentials will lead to the appearance of mobility edges @xcite - however , here we engineer them via a predictable analytical expression .    </S>",
    "<S> we again consider a correlated , quasiperiodic potential @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> eq . can be rewritten as @xmath74 where @xmath75     unit cell chain under antisymmetric quasiperiodic perturbation with strength @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> the analytically predicted mobility edge eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( black line ) separates extended ( blue ) and localized ( red ; @xmath77 ) modes . ]    </S>",
    "<S> eq . takes the form of a regular aubry - andr model , however with effective energy @xmath78 and potential strength @xmath79 , which are functions of the eigenstate energy @xmath80 and the original potential strength @xmath76 , i.e. eq .. therefore if present , a metal - insulator transition must occur for @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> this immediately yields a mobility edge dependence @xmath82 : @xmath83 for @xmath84 , the mobility edge curve is singular and zero , corresponding to the lack of any states , as previously mentioned . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : qp_spectrum ] we show the spectrum of eq . as a function of @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> we again compute the localization length @xmath85 with eq .. if the recursion converges to a finite number ( localized states , insulator ) , we plot blue points , while diverging cases are plotted in red ( extended states , metal ) . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical prediction eq . </S>",
    "<S> is also plotted and shows excellent agreement with numerical data .    </S>",
    "<S> _ generalizations  </S>",
    "<S> _ remarkably , this construction works in a plethora of other flat band models with cls . in higher dimensional lattices </S>",
    "<S> the construction of low energy eigenstates can proceed in exactly the same way : because the localization length is forced to vanish , for sufficiently small @xmath35 the eigenstates are near - sighted , so their properties are insensitive to the lattice dimension . </S>",
    "<S> the divergence in the density of states persists , in contrast to the more familiar van hove singularities which get weaker as the dimension increases .    as an example </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the 2d lieb lattice , which hosts a flat band with nontrivial topology . here </S>",
    "<S> the compact localized states occupy multiple unit cells ( shaded in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : lieb_spectrum ] ) and form an overcomplete non - orthogonal basis . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the flat band is frustrated : its projector is long - ranged ( power law decay in real space ) and it is forced to touch another dispersive band  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the band structure is determined by two dispersive @xmath86 and one flat @xmath0 bands  @xcite ( here all hoppings are assumed to be of value unity ) : @xmath87 for a given cls any onsite potential can be represented as a sum of a cls - preserving part and its orthogonal counterpart . a correlated potential for that given cls </S>",
    "<S> is then defined by zeroing the cls - preserving part . due to the above mentioned nontrivial topology of the 2d lieb lattice </S>",
    "<S> , this procedure can be extended to every second cls in a checkerboard arrangement with unit cell coordinates @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( @xmath90 are integers ) . </S>",
    "<S> we realize the correlated potential by choosing @xmath91 in each 8-site plaquette of a participating cls ( dashed enclosure ) in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lieb_spectrum](a ) ( @xmath92 and the onsite energies @xmath93 in the plaquette are random uncorrelated numbers with pdf @xmath94 ) . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the cross - stitch example , there are rapidly decaying eigenmodes with @xmath95 , which yield a square root singularity in the density of states . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lieb_spectrum](c ) shows the corresponding numerical results  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted square root singularity at @xmath96 lies on top of a background of width @xmath37 formed by the remaining cls that have their energies renormalized . </S>",
    "<S> also visible are two peaks at @xmath97 , which are the van hove singularities that have been regularized by the disorder . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the lieb lattice was very recently fabricated as a photonic lattice using femtosecond laser writing  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the required correlations can be readily introduced by modulation of the waveguide depths .     from eq </S>",

    "<S> the red line is a linear fit . ]    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion  _ we have shown how appropriately correlated disorder can transform the singular density of states at a flat band into weaker logarithmic or square root divergences . the resulting simple , analytically tractable models feature vanishing localization lengths for arbitrarily weak disorder , and mobility edges for quasiperiodic perturbations . </S>",
