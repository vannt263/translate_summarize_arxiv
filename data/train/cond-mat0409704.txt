    "the mae is defined as the difference of total energies with the orientations of magnetization pointing in different , e.g. , ( 001 ) and ( 111 ) , crystalline axis .",
    "the difference is not zero because of spin  orbit effect , which couples the magnetization to the lattice , and determines the direction of magnetization , called the easy axis .",
    "being a ground state property , the mae should be accessible in principle via spin density functional theory described above , and , despite the primary difficulty related to the smallness of mae ( @xmath54atom ) , great efforts to compute the quantity with advanced total energy methods combined with the development of faster computers , have seen success in predicting its correct orders of magnitudes   @xcite . however , the correct easy axis of ni has not been predicted by the lsda and a great amount of work has been done to understand what is the difficulty .",
    "these include ( i ) scaling spin  orbit coupling in order to enlarge its effect on the mae  @xcite , ( ii ) calculating torque to avoid comparing large numbers of energy  @xcite , ( iii ) studying the effects of the second hund s rule in the orbital polarization theory  @xcite , ( iv ) analyzing possible changes in the position of the fermi level by changing the number of valence electrons  @xcite , ( v ) using the state tracking method  @xcite , and ( iv ) real space approach  @xcite .",
    "it was recently suggested that the deficiency of the calculations is lying in improper treatment of the correlation effects and the intra  atomic repulsion @xmath55 and exchange @xmath56 should be taken into account .",
    "it is important to perform the calculations for fixed values of magnetic moments which themselves show some dependency on @xmath55 and @xmath56 as studied previously kudrnovsky . since the pure lsda result ( @xmath55=0 , and @xmath56=0 ) reproduces the experimental values for magnetic moments in both fe and ni fairly well , the @xmath57 parameter space should be scanned and the path of @xmath55 and @xmath56 values which hold the theoretical moments close to the experiment was extracted .",

    "after the flat area , the mae changes from the wrong easy axis to the correct easy axis .",

    "the calculated mae approaches this value around point @xmath88 . to summarize , the lsda+u approach with @xmath89 and @xmath90 adequately describes the magneto  crystalline anisotropy of cro@xmath91 .",
    "we can conclude that the calculations of magnetic anisotropy energies in materials are only in its beginning stage of development .it is by now clear that the effects of coulomb correlations must be taken seriously into account but the smallness of mae and its sensitivity to the values of @xmath55 used in the calculations prompts us that a predictive power of the method is yet to be achieved .",
    "more work is clearly required to develop robust algorithms calculating this highly important property of ferromagnets .",
    "while ferromagnetic spin alignments are relatively simple to explore by the methods of spin density functional theory , the situation gets formally much more complicated when non  collinearity occurs .",
    "the simplest example of non  collinearity is the antiferromagnetism which is the ordering with wave - vector @xmath92 corresponding to a zone  boundary point of the brillouin zone .",
    "this requires a choice of doubled unit cell so that in the new lattice this vector @xmath92 becomes one of the reciprocal lattice vectors . in a more general sense we can consider an appearance of a spin spiral which gives orientation of different magnetic moments @xmath93 for atoms of the sublattice @xmath94 ( @xmath95 is the basis vector , @xmath96 is the primitive translation ) in the form@xmath97where @xmath98 is the length of the atomic moment , and @xmath99 are the angles describing its orientation in the unit cell with @xmath100 as we see , in the systems with non  collinear ordering the situation gets immediately very complicated as  for arbitrary @xmath101 the size of the unit cell becomes prohibitively large",
    "note that here we do not assume that the size of the moment is varied when going from one cell to another .",
    "the latter is another type of so called incommensurate magnetism , the most known example of which is cr .    here",
    "we will briefly review a very elegant way to solve the problem of non  collinear magnetism where the size of the moment is kept constant which is known as the spin spiral method developed by sandratski @xcite .",
    "the problem when the size itself varies is more difficult one and the use of linear response theory will be discussed later of this review .",
    "the formal point is to note that non  collinear magnetic state destroys the periodicity of the original lattice and therefore the original bloch theorem applied to the kohn ",
    "sham states @xmath14 is no longer available . however , the bloch theorem in the present form reflects the translational symmetry properties of the lattice only it does not take into account the symmetry properties of the spin subsystem .",
    "a generalized symmetry treatment of the hamiltonian for the non  collinear magnet can be developed .",
    "let us define group operations acting on a spinor state @xmath102 these are",
    "( i ) the translational operator @xmath103 so that @xmath104 ( ii ) the generalized rotation @xmath105 which is a pure rotation @xmath106 described by the 3x3 @xmath107 wigner matrix @xmath108 ( where @xmath109 are the euler angles ) and possible shift by vector @xmath110 for non  symmorphic group so that @xmath111 ( iii ) the rotation @xmath112 in the spin@xmath113 subspace described by the 2x2 @xmath114 wigner matrix @xmath115 .",
    "the usefulness of these operations becomes immediately transparent if we explore symmetry properties of non  relativistic hamiltonians @xmath116 of the type ( [ sdfpau ] ) with non  collinear spin alignments which assumes that the effective magnetic field @xmath117 inside each atom centered at @xmath94 transforms similar to ( [ ssmmag ] ) .",
    "the translations @xmath96 combined with the spin rotations @xmath118 described by the unitary matrices @xmath119 leave the spin spiral structure invariant .",
    "we thus arrive to a generalized bloch theorem:@xmath120    remarkably that this property allows us to restrict the consideration to a chemical unit cell and not to the supercell .",
    "hence , instead of introducing the supercell whose size depends on the symmetry of wave vector @xmath92 , the non  collinear spin spiral states can still be treated with the hamiltonians whose size does not depend on the wavevector @xmath121    a variety of different calculations has been done with the spin spiral approach @xcite .",
    "halilov at .",
    "al halilov , halilovprb have studied adiabatic spin waves computed using a frozen magnon method . this is analogous to the frozen phonon method where atoms are displaced from their equilibrium positions and the total energy is restored as a function of these positions . here",

    "[ figswfe ] reproduces the comparison between calculated using frozen magnon lsda approach and experimental @xcite spin wave spectra for fe .",

    "the correlation effects become more important and the frozen magnon calculations using lsda+u method have been carried out .",

    "while the density functional theory provide a rigorous description of the ground state properties of magnetic materials , the finite  temperature magnetism is estimated following a simple suggestion @xcite , whereby constrained dft at @xmath122 is used to extract exchange constants for a _ classical _ heisenberg model , which in turn is solved using approximate methods ( e.g. rpa , mean field ) from a classical statistical mechanics of spin systems @xcite .",

    "the resonant photoemission experiments @xcite reflect the presence of local  moment polarization in the high  energy spectrum above the curie temperature in nickel , while the low  energy angle resolved photoemission investigations @xcite results in non ",
    "magnetic bands near the fermi level .",
    "this is exactly the dmft view on the electronic structure of transition metals above @xmath305 .",
    "fluctuating moments and atomic  like configurations are large at short times , which results in correlation effects in the high  energy spectra such as spin",
    " multiplet splittings .",
    "the moment is reduced at longer time scales , corresponding to a more band  like , less correlated electronic structure near the fermi level .",
    "nio and mno represent two classical mott  hubbard systems .",
    "both materials are insulators with the energy gap of a few ev regardless whether they are antiferro or paramagnetic .",
    "the spin dependent lsda theory strongly underestimates the energy gap in the ordered phase .",
    "this can be corrected by the use of the lda+u  method .",
    "both theories however fail completely to describe the local moment regime reflecting a general drawback of band theory to reproduce atomic limit .",
    "therefore the real challenge is to describe the paramagnetic insulating state where the self ",
    "energy effects are crucial both for the electronic structure and for recovering the correct phonon dispersions in these materials .",
    "the dmft calculations have been performed @xcite by taking into account correlations among @xmath292electrons . in the regime of large u adequate for both for nio and mno in the paramagnetic phase",
    "the correlations were treated within the well  known hubbard  i approximation .",
    "the calculated densities of states using the lda+dmft method for the paramagnetic state of nio and mno @xcite have revealed the presence of both lower and upper hubbard subbands .",
    "these were found in agreement with the lda+u calculations of anisimov @xcite which have been performed for the ordered states of these oxides .",
    "clearly , spin integrated spectral functions do not show an appreciable dependence with temperature and look similar below and above phase transition point .",
    "the progress in the electronic structure calculation with dmft allowed to apply the method to more complicated systems such as plutonium nature , science .",
    "the temperature dependence of atomic volume in pu is anomalous @xcite .",
    "it shows an enormous volume expansion between @xmath316 and @xmath317 phases which is about 25% . within the @xmath317 phase ,",
    "the metal shows negative thermal expansion . transition between @xmath318 and higher ",
    "temperature @xmath319 phase occurs with a 5% volume collapse .",
    "also , pu shows anomalous resistivity behavior @xcite characteristic for the heavy fermion systems , but neither of its phases is magnetic .",
    "the susceptibility is small and relatively temperature independent .",
    "the photoemission @xcite shows a strong narrow kondo  like peak at the fermi level consistent with large values of the linear specific heat coefficient .",
    "density functional based lda  and gga  calculations describe the properties of pu incorrectly .",
    "they predict magnetic ordering @xcite .",
    "they underestimate @xcite equilibrium volume of the @xmath317 and @xmath320 phase by as much as 30% , the largest discrepancy known in lda , which usually predicts the volume of solids within a few % accuracy even for such correlated systems as high temperature superconductors .    to address these questions several approaches have been developed .",
    "the lda+u method was applied to @xmath317 pu @xcite .",
    "it is able to produce the correct volume of the @xmath317 phase for values of the parameter @xmath3214 ev consistent with atomic spectral data and constrained density functional calculations .",
    "similar calculation has been performed by a so  called orbitally ordered density functional method @xcite . however , both methods predict pu to be magnetic , which is not observed experimentally .",
    "the lda+u method is unable to predict the correct excitation spectrum . also , to recover the @xmath316 phase within lda+u@xmath161the parameter u has to be set to zero which is inconsistent with its transport properties and with microscopic calculations of this parameter .",
    "another approach proposed @xcite in the past is the constrained lda approach in which some of the 5f electrons , are treated as core , while the remaining are allowed to participate in band formation .",
    "results of the self  interaction  corrected lda calculations have been reported @xcite , as well as qualitative discussion of the bonding nature across the actinides series has been given @xcite .",
    "dynamical mean  field calculations have been recently applied with success to this material .",
    "they were performed in paramagnetic state and do not impose magnetic ordering .",
    "dmft was able to predict the appearance of a strong quasiparticle peak near the fermi level which exists in the both phases .",
    "also , the lower and upper hubbard bands were clearly distinguished .",
    "the width of the quasiparticle peak in the @xmath316 phase is found to be larger by 30 per cent compared to the width in the @xmath317 phase .",
    "this indicates that the low  temperature phase is more metallic , i.e. it has larger spectral weight in the quasiparticle peak and smaller weight in the hubbard bands .",
    "recent advances have allowed the experimental determination of these spectra , and these calculations were consistent with these measurements @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , electronic structure methods have been applied with success to study magnetic properties of solids .",
    "many good results have been obtained for weakly correlated itinerant systems .",
    "new algorithms for inclusion of many ",
    "body effects are beginning to attack magnetic phenomena in strongly correlated materials .",
    "these successes have generated a new synergy between the electronic structure and many  body communities , which are jointly developing new and powerful electronic structure tools for virtual material exploration .",
