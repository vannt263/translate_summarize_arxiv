    "disc galaxies contain a substantial amount of baryonic matter outside the disc , and this extra - planar material has become an important problem to study for a number of reasons .",
    "theoretically , since the pioneering papers by @xcite and @xcite that invoked the presence of a high pressure ` coronal ' gas outside the disc , its existence has been debated .",
    "early works on galaxy formation suggested that the collapse of halos should lead to shock heated gas in the halo .",
    "however , various physical processes during the galactic evolution , such as star formation , galaxy mergers and stripping by intergalactic medium ( igm ) would have played a significant role in shaping the extra - planar material that is observed today .",
    "recent observations have detected this extra - planar gas in hi ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in h@xmath6 @xcite and in x - rays @xcite . the extra - planar gas , and its different phases , appear in the literature under different names , a few of which are listed below .",
    "_ hot halo gas _ : in the standard cold dark matter scenario of structure formation in the universe , baryonic gas falls into dark matter potentials and gets heated to the virial temperature @xcite .",
    "the gas then cools radiatively , and if the temperature is such that the cooling is rapid ( for @xmath7 k ) , for the case of low mass galaxies , then no accretion shock develops outside the evolving disc , and most of the halo gas remains at a temperature lower than the virial temperature @xcite .",
    "this scenario of cold accretion for low mass galaxies has received some observational support in recent years ( e.g. , smith et al 2008 ) . in massive galaxies , the hot halo gas is believed to cool slowly , and eventually form warm ( @xmath8 k ) clouds embedded in a large scale hot corona .",
    "these clouds could fall down on the disc in the form of high velocity clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "numerical simulations have also shown that disc galaxies to be embedded in a hot gaseous halo ( toft et al 2002 ; keres et al 2005 ) , and that the x - ray luminosity of the halo gas should scale with galactic mass .",
    "however this hypothetical hot halo gas is yet to be observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and the observations of the extraplanar gas so far have been limited to regions close to the disc and bulge , or around active star forming regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . moreover , if the halo does contain a large amount of gas , it could potentially explain the missing baryon problem , which states that more than @xmath9 of the baryons are unaccounted for by collapsed gas and stars in galaxies @xcite .",
    "_ galactic wind _ : the subsequent evolution of the halo gas is thought to be governed both by the inflow of gas from the igm and energy injection processes in the disc .",
    "many star forming galaxies have been observed to contain a large amount of outflowing gas ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the early observations of outflowing gas in m82 led to the development of parker - type steady winds with energy and mass injection from supernovae ( sne ) @xcite .",
    "these calculations showed that fast steady winds with speeds exceeding @xmath10 km s@xmath11 are possible to generate from the central regions of m82-type starburst galaxies .",
    "@xcite explored steady wind solution with radiative cooling and showed that emission in halos can arise from thermally unstable outflows . @xcite",
    "studies the sne driven outflow and its interaction with halo gas and estimated the extended x - ray emission from m82 type galaxy .",
    "detailed numerical simulations have been carried out focused on properties of outflows and their implication for igm enrichment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently @xcite studied steady galactic winds from dark matter halos with navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) density profile @xcite and found that sne can drive outflows from dwarf galaxies , and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) power the outflows with speeds exceeding @xmath10",
    "@xmath12  in massive galaxies , e.g. , ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) .",
    "they also found that winds from intermediate sized galaxies which are in a quiescent mode of star formation ( e.g. the milky way ) can not escape the halo .",
    "as a consequence of this , one can explain the observed trend of the stellar to halo mass ratio .    _ outflowing cold / warm clouds _ : the outflowing gas is often observed to contain a clumpy component that contains neutral or partially ionized atoms , at @xmath8 k ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in starbursts such as m82 , molecular clouds and filaments have also been observed in the outflowing gas @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of these clouds offer useful clues to the formation and evolution of the outflowing gas , and recently have been used to discuss various physical processes that drives these clouds . @xcite and @xcite suggested that radiation pressure on dust grains embedded in these clouds may play an important role in their dynamics ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that radiation pressure becomes important only for galaxies with mass @xmath13 m@xmath14 and with high sfr , e.g. , for ulirgs .",
    "however , the formation process of these clouds remain uncertain .",
    "@xcite argued that the clouds are likely to be shredded by kelvin - helmholtz instability and/or evaporation due to thermal conduction , with a time scale @xmath15 myr .",
    "it is therefore a puzzle that these clouds are often observed at distances of several kpc , since the travel time ( assuming the speed to be a few hundred km s@xmath11 ) is likely to be @xmath16 myr . @xcite and @xcite have suggested a scenario in which radiation pressure pushes a shell of gas and dust which then fragments after being accelerated by thermal pressure from sne ejecta .    _ high velocity clouds _ : the extraplanar gas is also affected by disc ism processes in another way . in the galactic fountain model @xcite , partially ionized gas is launched from the disc by the effect of multiple supernovae ( sne ) , and after travelling some distance in the halo it falls back to the disc .",
    "an important problem in this regard is that of the formation of clouds in the extraplanar gas , which are observed as either high velocity clouds ( hvc ) or clouds .",
    "@xcite argued that hvcs could form from the condensation of galactic fountain material ( but see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , this idea can not explain the fact that observed metallicity is less than that of the disc ism @xcite .",
    "this is particularly important for hvcs which are more than @xmath17 kpc away from the milky way disc which have low metallicity ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "recently , @xcite have argued that thermal instability is not efficient in the moving fountain gas , and clouds are rather likely to form due to the interaction of ejected disc material with an pre - existing halo gas ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the ejected disc material is modeled in a ballistic manner , whereas in reality the outward moving gas is more likely to move like a fluid .",
    "@xcite found that absorption associated with hvcs can arise from the interface between the hvc and a coronal gas .",
    "however we note that , in the hvcs nearer than @xmath16 kpc , there can be a mixture of components from galactic ism , the interface region with halo gas , or gas from the local group .",
    "thus the overall picture is tangled because of a contamination at lower heights connected with interaction of falling gas with the extended gas of galactic corona or by the flows generated by internal galactic processes .",
    "_ circumgalactic medium _ : the gaseous content of spiral galaxies outside the disc but within the halos of dark matter , formed and shaped by various processes of accretion and outflows , as mentioned above , is generally referred to as the circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) .",
    "this refers to the reservoir of gas at distances @xmath19 kpc .",
    "however , its existence , and the relation to processes near and in the disc are not yet fully understood .",
    "although outflowing gas is observed near the disc , it is not clear how far this gas propagates , and about the nature of the interaction with pre - existing gas in the halo .",
    "it is uncertain if most of the wind material escapes the halo , or is retained in the halo , and then whether or not most of this gas eventually falls back to the disc .",
    "a large amount of hot gas in halo can potentially distort the cosmic microwave background radiation through sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the low density of the cgm makes it an elusive component to observe , but recently it has been detected through absorption in the line of sight of background quasars .",
    "@xcite detected a large amount of absorbing gas , at @xmath20 k , in galaxies with moderate sfr .",
    "however , its spatial extent and the total gas ( and metal ) content remains to be measured with enough accuracy that can constrain theoretical models .    in the present paper",
    "we address the question of the origin of high velocity clouds , circumgalactic material and the cold clumps in galactic winds , as a result of the interaction of a steady galactic wind with the relic halo gas distribution using 2d simulations .",
    "our aim is to show that all these constituents of extra planar material may have a common origin , which is the interaction zone between galactic outflow and hot gas in halo .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe our simulation set - up , including the initial and boundary conditions . in ",
    "3 we give analytical estimates for the dynamics of the interaction zone , and compare the timescales relevant for the problem . in  4 we present the results of our model runs and then in  5 we discuss our results along with the implications .",

    "[ fig_denprof ] , we have shown the density profile of the halo gas for the halo of mass @xmath35 @xmath46 , considered in this work .         we set - up a simulation box in which @xmath24 ranges from @xmath47 to @xmath48 and @xmath22 goes from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , where @xmath49 is the launching height .",

    "we use the density profile given by equation ( [ eq_haloprof ] ) for outer boundaries at @xmath52 and @xmath53 , so that the initial hydrostatic distribution of gas does not change with time . at the lower @xmath22 boundary",

    "we inject ( continuously in time ) the gas with speed @xmath56 and density @xmath57 in a section of the lower boundary which satisfies @xmath54 .",
    "the injected gas has a temperature corresponding to the sound speed ( @xmath58 ) somewhat lower than the injection speed ( @xmath56 ) to ensure that the flow is in supersonic regime .",
    "this value of @xmath56 will give a wind speed @xmath59 , which can be understood simply by the fact that in the supersonic regime , as the wind diverges , the sound speed decreases to small values and the wind speed becomes the sum of initial injection speed and the sound speed at the base .",
    "a supersonic injection right from the base implies that we have assumed a thermalization zone with dimensions @xmath54 , @xmath60 centred at the galaxy in which the energy and mass injection due to stellar processes occurs .",

    "this problem has similarities with the case of a wind blown bubble where the stellar wind is expanding in a uniform density medium @xcite .",
    "however there are some subtle differences between the stellar wind blown bubble and the present case of galactic wind interacting with the halo gas . while in the stellar wind blown bubble",
    "the ambient medium is denser than the wind , here it is the opposite , at least for the initial evolution when the wind density is larger compared to the ambient density .",
    "also , the temperature of the ambient medium in this case is @xmath92 k , which is two orders of magnitude larger than the ism temperature ( @xmath93 k ) , relevant for a stellar wind blown bubble .",
    "another difference is the stratification in the density of the ambient halo gas . because of the stratification , the outermost shock does not slow down quickly and the late time evolution should not be given by a self - similar solution as described in @xcite .",
    "one should instead work out the dynamics after taking the density profile into account as in @xcite . due to this effect ,",
    "the free expansion phase of the wind lasts longer and if the wind has enough mechanical luminosity so that it crosses the scale height of the halo gas profile , then it may keep expanding freely with the normal wind speed and eventually escape the halo .",
    "we quantify these aspects below .",
    "in the general case of a supernova blast or a wind interacting with ambient medium there are three distinct phases of evolution .",
    "initially there is the free expansion phase .",
    "when the swept up mass becomes comparable to the mass in the wind then the wind is obstructed by the outside mass and the free expansion phase ends , the wind enters the next phase of evolution in which the motion can be described by a self - similar solution .",
    "this phase ends when radiative losses become significant and the system enters into a momentum driven phase .",
    "let us do a simple estimate for the distance ( @xmath94 ) at which the transition from a free wind phase to self similar phase is expected .",
    "it can be computed by equating the swept up mass with the injected mass . for this rough estimate",
    ", we assume the injection region to be spherical with a radius @xmath49 , since @xmath49 is much smaller than the length scale of winds involved in our simulations .",
    "this gives , @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the density profile of the gas in the halo as given by equation ( @xmath97 ) and @xmath98 is the time which marks the end of free expansion phase .",
    "the left hand side in the above equation is the swept up mass of the halo gas and the right hand side is the total injected mass till the time @xmath98 .",
    "the @xmath94 is related to @xmath98 via @xmath99 . as explained in the  2.2 that in the supersonic regime wind speed is , @xmath100 ,",
    "therefore @xmath101.we find that @xmath94 is roughly constant for @xmath102 @xmath27 , and lies in the range of @xmath103 kpc , but it increases to @xmath104 kpc for @xmath105 @xmath27 .",
    "this implies that for low injection density , the free expansion phase ends well inside the high density core of the halo gas profile , and the shell will decelerate according to the weaver et al .",

    "mg6 _ with large injection density shows less deceleration compared to _",
    "mg7_. if we consider a power - law density profile given by @xmath110 , then in the self - similar phase one would expect @xmath111 and @xmath112 . the halo gas profile ( fig [ fig_denprof ] ) beyond the core region",
    "can be approximated as a power law decreasing with @xmath23 , with index @xmath113 .",
    "one therefore expects @xmath114 , implying only a mild decrease in velocity with time ( or distance ) , which indeed is seen in fig [ fig_vsh ] for the case of",
    "( dashed line ) . for the case of _ mg7 _ ( dotted line ) , with a low injection density , the final velocity is lower because it enters the self - similar phase at the core region of the halo density profile and therefore it exhibits a steeper decrease in velocity initially .",
    "there is one regime in which our results should resemble the self - similar solution of the ` standard stellar wind bubble ' . in an extreme situation , for very small values of @xmath94",
    ", the wind will decelerate quickly .",
    "we can quantify this regime in the following manner .",
    "the extent of the free expansion phase is small for low injection densities .",
    "therefore , the evolution is governed mainly by the self - similar solution , for which the distance of the outermost shock is @xmath115 and the corresponding velocity is @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the density of the halo gas , whose value is almost constant ( @xmath43 @xmath118  ) at small distances from the centre . considering the inverse power law dependence of the velocity ( @xmath106 ) on time , it may so happen that the wind travels a small distance and it decelerates to negligible velocities .",
    "in such a case there is no significant large scale wind .",
    "hence for very low mechanical luminosities , when @xmath57 and @xmath56 are both small , we have a small scale wind . using the mechanical luminosity , @xmath119",
    ", we can write the following general expression for @xmath120 in this case , @xmath121 from the above equation , larger is the value of @xmath57 and @xmath56 , larger will be the value of @xmath120 .",
    "if we assume that the wind decelerates to a small velocity , say @xmath122 @xmath12  , before crossing @xmath123 kpc ( i.e. , the core of the gas density profile in halo ) , then the corresponding values of @xmath57 and @xmath56 separates the cases of small scale wind bubble and the large scale galactic wind .",
    "note that the mechanical luminosity corresponding to the limiting case given by the above equation is @xmath124 erg s@xmath11 .",
    "we also note that if the @xmath57 is too large such that the total energy lost per unit time due to radiative cooling ( @xmath125 ) at the base is more than the energy injection rate at the base ( @xmath126 ) , then it will lead to catastrophic cooling .",
    "to quantify this we can define the following ratio , @xmath127 assuming @xmath128 erg @xmath129 s@xmath11 .",
    "we note that the above condition implies a critical mechanical luminosity of @xmath130 erg s@xmath11 above which the cooling should dominate , and in this case the outflow would be strictly momentum driven .",
    "here we present the results from five of our runs . to start with",
    "we show the case with no radiative cooling in figure [ fig_mg1 ] , which clearly demonstrates the effect of the halo gas on the wind .",
    "one can see the formation of eddies at the periphery of the wind cone due to the relative motion between the wind gas and the halo gas , and the onset of kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "this leads to turbulent mixing of gas in the halo .",
    "note that the forward shock in this run reaches a distance of @xmath131 kpc in the vertical direction by 47 myr , and shock heats the ambient halo gas . at this time",
    ", there is a contact discontinuity at a vertical distance of @xmath132 kpc , where one finds a slightly higher density .",
    "the region vertically below this contact discontinuity is occupied by shocked wind gas , and heated by the reverse shock .",
    "if a wind is launched with a radial injection in vacuum , it diverges geometrically as it reaches large distances . in other words",
    "if the injection and the external forces are spherically symmetric then the wind will keep following the radial streamlines . in our case",
    "although the wind is launched only with @xmath133component of velocity , the high pressure of the fluid ensures that the wind diverges as soon as it enters the box .    in this first case of ours",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig_mg1 ] that the wind cone does not diverge as much as it should have done if it were to expand freely in vacuum .",
    "it is halted at a distance of @xmath132 kpc because of the resistance offered by the halo gas .",

    "previous studies have shown that the wind may or may not diverge with increasing distance , depending on how stratified the ambient medium is .",
    "it has been shown that if the ambient medium has an exponential or gaussian density distribution then also the wind diverges as it does in vacuum @xcite .",
    "however if the decrease in density is not steep , then one would expect a reduction in the cone width at large distances .    .",

    "the cold clouds that form on the periphery of the eddies remain in the simulation box , but a few clouds that form on top of the wind cone escapes the simulation box by the end of the run .",

    "this has occurred due to strong cooling in this higher density case .",
    "this structure is an outcome of our assumption of single injection site centred at the galaxy . in reality",
    "the injection zones may be randomly distributed in the entire disc . in that case",
    "the winds emerging from different injection zones will collide and there will be a more non - uniform density and temperature profile in the region above the disc plane ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "and injection density at the base is 1.0 @xmath27 . ]    in figure [ fig_mg4 ] , we increase the wind injection speed to @xmath139 km s@xmath11 and injection density to 2 @xmath27 and we also increase the size of the simulation box , in order to study whether or not the wind with large injection speed can travel large distances and escape . in this case , the wind clears the simulation box in @xmath140 myr .",
    "the additional momentum pushes the compressed shell further into the halo , where the shell gas is diluted and does not fragment into clouds . finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig_mg5 ] we decrease the wind density and keep a injection velocity of 500 @xmath12  in a box height of 100 kpc . in this case ,",
    "radiative cooling is not so effective because of lower density as in the previous case .",
    "also , the wind can not escape because at some height the wind density falls below that of the halo gas . as a combined effect of these two aspects",
    ", we have regions of low density warm gas ( @xmath141 k ) present in the halo , as shown in the density and temperature snapshots .",
    "the column density of this warm gas is @xmath142 @xmath5 , e.g. for a density of @xmath143 @xmath5 and a length scale of @xmath16 kpc .",
    "hence these regions are likely candidates for absorption systems observed repeatedly in the past as a circum - galactic medium in the halos of galaxies @xcite .",
    "and injection density at the base is 2 @xmath27 . ]    and injection density at the base is 0.5 @xmath27 . ]",
    "note that a warm - hot phase ( @xmath3 k ) is also present in other cases .",
    "for example if we look at the temperature profile of clouds in the lower panel of _",
    "mg2 _ and _ mg3 _ in figs .",
    "[ fig_mg2 ] and [ fig_mg3 ] , they have a wake of warm gas behind them , which appears greenish and roughly corresponds to a temperature of @xmath144 k. the presence of warm - hot medium in the wakes of high velocity clouds is also suggested recently by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , observations suggest that hvcs contain different species from ionized to neutral @xcite .",
    "we suggest that different species can be explained considering the variation of temperature around the cloud centre ( e.g. , in the wake of the cloud ) .",
    "furthermore , the temperature snapshots of _ mg1 _ ( the simulation run without cooling ) show regions with gas at @xmath145 k , which implies that if the cooling is suppressed ( possibly in systems with low metallicities ) , one can also generate absorption systems simply by adiabatic cooling of galactic wind gas that is confined inside the halo .",
    "we plot the gas velocities as a function of the vertical distance for four snapshots in the case of _",
    "( top left panel ) , _",
    "( top right ) , _ mg4 _",
    "( bottom left ) , _ mg5 _ ( bottom right ) in figure [ fig_v ] .",
    "the wind speed initially increases to a value almost double of the injection speed , as expected in a steady ( transonic ) wind case @xcite , and explained in  2.2 .",
    "the wind speed then drops to a low value at a certain distance because of the interaction with halo gas .",
    "this signifies the boundary between the steady wind and shocked wind that arises due to a reverse shock .",
    "then , depending on the efficiency of cooling , there is a formation of thin shell which becomes momentum driven , and a consequent rise in the velocity is seen .",
    "in contrast , for the case of low cooling efficiency ( bottom right panel , for the run _ mg5 _ ) , the shocked region is thick and the existence of thin shells is not apparent in the velocity plot .     +     another important point to note in the velocity plots is the effect of the halo gas in decelerating the wind front .",
    "compare the bottom - left and bottom - right panels , for the high injection speeds . with a lower injection density in the bottom - right panel , we find that the wind is stuck at @xmath146 kpc even when the injection speed is large enough to overcome the gravitational potential barrier .",
    "this is an example in which the wind is contained within the halo due to the resistance offered by the halo gas .",
    "this aspect is also clear from our discussion in  3 where in fig [ fig_vsh ] we have plotted the velocities of the forward shocks for _ mg6 _ and _ mg7 _ using dashed and dotted lines .",
    "although these two runs have same injection speed , still for _ mg7 _ , the velocity of the forward shock becomes almost half of that in _",
    "we would like to point out that the wind gas cools but does not fragment while the fragmentation occurs only in the dense shell .",
    "the reason is that thermal instability grows fast in the compressed high density region while the wind gas diverges on account of its speed , and becomes dilute after entering the simulation box , and the low density does not favour thermal instability .",
    "here we would like to determine the properties of the clouds formed in our simulations .",
    "in this regard , we estimate the size and mean density of the clouds . numerically ,",
    "this is achieved in a few steps , in which we first consider a particular snapshot of the simulation and find all the local maxima in density .",
    "then we define circles of radius ( @xmath147 ) centered at the position of the local maxima .",
    "we start with a minimum value of the @xmath147 , which is greater than the size of the smallest computational cell in the simulation and calculate the average density in the circular region .",
    "we then keep increasing the value of @xmath147 and determine the average density ( @xmath148 ) as a function of @xmath147 .",
    "the result is shown in left and right panels of figure [ fig_cloudsize ] corresponding to the runs _",
    "mg2 _ and _ mg3 _ at @xmath149 myr , respectively .",
    "each line in the plot corresponds to a single cloud .",
    "we can see that , for small values of @xmath147 , the densities are high and they decrease slowly with @xmath147 , as we sample the inner high density region of the cloud and slowly move outward .",
    "afterwards , there is a steep fall in density with @xmath147 as we move out of the cloud region . in the end ,",
    "the density decreases slowly once again when @xmath147 has become large and the mean density is determined by the gas surrounding the cloud .",
    "size of the cloud is in roughly in the range @xmath150 pc as inferred from the steeper part of the curves when the density decrease rapidly , which implies the transition from high density cloud to low density ambient medium .",
    "the estimated size of the clouds ( @xmath151 ) is greater than the smallest cell size in our simulation which is @xmath152 pc .",
    "also this estimate for cloud size is consistent with the sizes expected from thermal instability , @xmath153 , since @xmath154 myr and @xmath155 @xmath12  .",
    "the average density of the clouds ( @xmath148 ) is in the range @xmath156 @xmath27 .",
    "mass of the cloud can be calculated using @xmath157 , which comes out to be @xmath158 m@xmath2 .",
    "considering the fact that roughly @xmath159 clouds are present in the simulation box we find that total mass in clouds is @xmath160 m@xmath2 .",
    "we note that observations also find a similar amount of mass contained in hvcs @xcite , although in the simulations the total mass in hvcs is model dependent .",

    "for the case of _ mg2 _",
    "( left column of plots ) we obtain a normal distribution for the velocities .",
    "it is interesting to note that observations of hvcs in the galaxy also indicate a normal distribution of velocities in gsr frame , with a mean velocity of @xmath166 km s@xmath11 @xcite . comparing with the distribution found in our simulation in fig .",
    "[ fig_hist ] , we can speculate that the hvcs in the milky way are created within the last @xmath167 myr , since the left - uppermost panel does show a significant contribution to negative velocities .",
    "it is also possible that the halo gas distribution in milky way differs from the simple profile assumed here , which may lead to differences in the dynamics of clouds .",
    "however , the overall agreement between our simulation result and the observed distribution of hvcs is encouraging . in case of our run",
    "( right column of plots ) we find that a significant number of clouds have positive velocity with respect to the galactic centre .",
    "the distribution appears to be bimodal with a normal component centred at a mean velocity of roughly zero and another component having positive velocities indicating outflow .",
    "this is because of the fact that the mechanical luminosity of injected wind in case of _",
    "mg3 _ is high , resulting in a greater number of outflowing clouds .",
    "we conclude that with a suitable combination of @xmath57 and @xmath56 , which in turn depend on the sfr , wind loading factor and the efficiency of energy injection from sne , one can explain the cold clumpy outflows in galaxies with high sfrs as well as the properties of hvcs in quiescent galaxy such as ours .",
    "we summarise our results by representing the outcome of different simulation runs in the parameter space of @xmath168 in figure [ last ] . for this purpose",
    "we use the results of all our runs mentioned in table 1 , besides the ones discussed in the previous section . based on our discussions so far",
    ", we can first exclude two regions which do not show significant amount of multiphase extraplanar gas .",
    "they are :    * _ small scale wind bubble _ : as discussed in the beginning of our analytical estimates (  3 ) , if the shell decelerates to negligible speeds within a distance @xmath16 kpc , then the wind is confined to small scales and we refer to the case as small scale wind bubble . at later times the wind material in this case collapses on itself .",
    "we mark this case with an open circle in figure [ last ] .",
    "+ we also note that for the cases such as these the efficiency of energy injection in the wind and the wind mechanical luminosity would also be unphysically small ( @xmath169 erg s@xmath11 )",
    ". the limiting combination of @xmath57 and @xmath56 that leads to such cases can be obtained from equation ( [ sssw ] ) by requiring @xmath170 kpc , and one finds a scaling of @xmath171 which divides this small scale wind with the galactic wind .",
    "we show this limiting combination as a solid line in the bottom - left corner of figure [ last ] . *",
    "_ catastrophic cooling _",
    ": if the injection density is very large , then the energy loss by cooling can be catastrophic and the wind material enters the simulation box and cools quickly before it can diverge into a cone .",
    "two of our simulation runs ( _ mg14 _ and _ mg15 _ ) show this characteristic and are marked by open squares in figure [ last ] .",
    "the corresponding criteria for onset of catastrophic cooling can be inferred from equation ( [ eq_catcool ] ) by setting @xmath172 .",
    "the boundary line for this case has a scaling of @xmath173 , and is shown in fig [ last ] by a dash - dotted line .",
    "apart from the combination of @xmath57 and @xmath56 for the above two regions , we find significant fragmentation in the interaction zones in other cases . in our runs _",
    "mg2 _ and _ mg3 _ , the interaction zone fragments rapidly into cold clouds of @xmath174 k. in _ mg2 _ , as the wind gas ploughs through the halo gas , eddies are formed in the side walls due to the relative motion .",
    "these eddies break out of the bulk flow and form cool clouds .",
    "as discussed earlier , we have found the total mass enclosed in these clouds to be @xmath175 m@xmath14 and they extend out to @xmath16 kpc from the galactic centre .",
    "these clouds represents the case of high velocity clouds and this suggestion is also supported by the comparison of the velocity distributions of hvcs and clouds in runs similar to _",
    "mg2_. we mark these cases with triangles pointing downward in fig 10 ( e.g. , _ mg2 _ ) .",
    "if the injection speed and density are high , as in _ mg3 _ , then the wind cone diverges up to a large distance .",
    "the clouds formed in these cases ( marked with diamonds in fig 10 ) are entrained in the bulk flow .",
    "therefore a large number of clouds have a positive velocity outward from the galactic centre as indicated by the velocity histogram in the right panel of fig [ fig_hist ] .",
    "we note that these cases resemble the scenario of cold clouds embedded in steady winds @xcite .    in our run _",
    "mg5 _ , the interaction between the wind and the halo gas leads to significant regions of warm - hot ( @xmath3 k ) gas , and in this case cooling is not effective enough to produce cold clumps.the column density of the warm - hot gas in this case is sufficiently large to explain the observed absorption , as discussed earlier .",
    "we mark the cases similar to _ mg5 _ in fig 10 with filled circles .",
    "we note here that the @xmath3 k gas is also visible in the wakes behind the moving clouds in our runs _",
    "mg2 _ and _ mg3 _ , which can also give rise to absorption ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , if the wind density and speed are further increased , then the wind crosses @xmath0 kpc ( our simulation box ) and possibly escapes the virial radius .",
    "the runs that show these features are marked by triangles pointing upward in the top - right corner of fig .",
    "the shell in this case fragments as well if the density is sufficiently high and clumps can be driven into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "these cases are responsible for the metal enrichment of the igm @xcite .     and @xmath56 .",
    "the dashed and dash - dotted lines represent the boundaries of region for small scale wind bubble ( bottom left corner ) and catastrophic cooling ( bottom right corner ) respectively .",
    "logarithm of wind mass loading rate ( @xmath176 ) , is shown by colour coding , with bright yellow regions representing large values of @xmath64 .",
    "three parallel solid lines are the contours corresponding to @xmath177 from left to right respectively . ]    the mass loading rate in the wind can be written as @xmath178 .",
    "the mass loading rate is related to the sfr ( @xmath179 ) and values of this quantity for our runs is provided in table 1 . here in fig [ last ]",
    "we have plotted this quantity using a colour code for increasing @xmath180 from dark green to bright yellow .",
    "if we consider a constant @xmath66 then the dark green regions correspond to low sfr and the bright yellow regions , to high sfr .",
    "we can see that the simulation runs producing cgm fall mostly in the low sfr region .",
    "the escaping winds and wind embedded clouds occupy the high sfr zones , and the infalling cold clouds occupy the intermediate sfr regions . for the milky way with a sfr@xmath134 m@xmath2 yr@xmath11 , and considering a low @xmath181",
    ", it should occupy the lower central region of fig [ last ] .",
    "the result that this region is dominated by infalling clouds in our simulations , agrees with the observations of hvcs in our galaxy .",
    "we note that from table 1 , for the milky way sfr , and for our run _ mg2 _ , we obtain @xmath182 , which implies @xmath183 .",
    "also the efficiency of energy injection , @xmath184 , which is small and consistent for a quiescent galaxy such as the milky way .",
    "we further note that , given a sfr one can determine the value of @xmath66 from figure [ last ] by comaring with observed morphology of extraplanar gas .",
    "similarly one can determine @xmath71 by using the relation @xmath185 .",
    "therefore this figure can be used in conjunction with equation ( [ eq_ett ] ) and ( [ eq_eff ] ) , as a diagnostic to find physical values of wind parameters such as @xmath66 and @xmath71 , by matching with observations .",
    "we have also shown three contours ( solid lines ) of constant @xmath64 , corresponding to @xmath186 m@xmath2 yr@xmath11 from left to right respectively .",
    "these contours help us to draw important conclusions about the possible values of @xmath66 and sfr .",
    "for example , hvcs and cgm are likely to appear when the wind mass loading rate is @xmath187 m@xmath2 yr@xmath11 , and the outflowing clouds and escaping winds are possible when the mass loading rate is @xmath188 m@xmath2 yr@xmath11 .",
    "this also agrees with the observations where the cold clumpy outflows are observed in galaxies with high star formations rates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there is yet another interpretation to this figure .",
    "if we consider that the sfr is fixed and the mass loading ( @xmath66 ) varies in the plot box , then the left part of the figure represent weak winds with a small mass loading and the right part a highly loaded wind .",
    "the central part of the figure [ last ] is the place where wind has a optimum value of mass loading , so as to have physically plausible winds which can explain the hvcs and cold clumpy outflows .",
    "if we assume that the initial stage of galactic evolution is marked by high sfr , then we expect those galaxies to occupy the top - right corner of figure [ last ] , the region of escaping winds .",
    "as the galaxy loses gas via these escaping winds , the sfr decreases , and one enters the regions of either to the left or bottom - left of fig [ last ] depending on the rate of decrement of sfr .",
    "this will determine whether or not these galaxies should have a significant amount of cgm or hvcs ( which may sustain the sfr ) .",
    "therefore the interaction between the wind and the halo gas is a crucial factor in galactic evolution .",
    "thermal instability is suppressed in a freely expanding galactic wind @xcite .",
    "recent simulations show that clouds also can not condense spontaneously from the hot gas in the halo @xcite .",
    "however , here we have found that clouds can condense in the compressed region formed due to galactic outflow punching through the halo gas .",
    "therefore , this work can be considered a hybrid scenario of the cloud formation from galactic outflow ( fountain ) and/or the cloud condensation from a stationary or infalling halo gas .",
    "we would like to point out following limitations of our simulations .",
    "we have assumed a uniform metallicity throughout the simulation box , although at large scales inside the halo , the metallicity can vary .",
    "this may have lead to an overestimation of cooling in these calculations .",
    "however , we also note that these simulations are in 2d for which the effect of cooling is under - estimated .",
    "gas metallicity at large distances from the plane is expected to be lower than in the disk , although it is not clear by how much . for such conditions",
    "all the features of the expanding wind bubble would be similar except the transition of the shock front to radiative phase will take longer time .",
    "we wish to address these issues in a future paper .",
    "we have simulated the interaction of a galactic wind with the hot halo gas .",
    "we have found that the wind drives a shell of compressed gas which fragments due to instabilities and leads to the formation of hvcs , regions and outflowing clouds depending on the amount of cooling .",
    "we have categorized the formation of various multiphase media in the parameter space of injection velocity and density , which are the input parameters for our simulations .",
    "we have found that clouds formed in our simulations have a total mass of @xmath1 m@xmath2 , and they have a distribution of velocity similar to that of observed hvcs . for higher density and velocity of injection corresponding to vigorously star forming galaxies ,",
    "a significant number of clouds are outflowing .",
    "furthermore the circumgalactic material with a temperature in range @xmath189 k is also seen in our simulations with column density appropriate to give rise to the observed absorption .",
    "these results lead to the conclusion that hvcs , cold outflows and the circumgalactic medium can form due to the interaction of galactic wind with halo gas .",
    "the injection density and velocity are linked with the sfr , the mass loading factor of outflows and the efficiency of energy injection by sne .",
    "therefore , the results deduced in these simulations may serve as a diagnostic to constrain the feedback efficiency of outflows",
