    "<S> we trap and cool a gas composed of @xmath0k and @xmath1rb , using a two - species magneto - optical trap ( mot ) . </S>",

    "<S> the four - color laser system is described , and the single - species and two - species mots are characterized . </S>",
    "<S> atom numbers of @xmath2 @xmath0k and @xmath3 @xmath1rb are trapped in the two - species mot . </S>",
    "<S> observation of trap loss due to collisions between species is presented and future prospects for the experiment are discussed . +   + pacs number(s ) : 32.80.pj , 03.75.fi , 05.30.fk +   +    epsf    the first experimental realizations of bose - einstein condensation in dilute atomic gases @xcite brought with them an ever - increasing interest in the quantum behavior of such systems . </S>",
    "<S> these systems exhibit weak and controllable interactions , and are typically simpler to describe theoretically than their condensed matter counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum statistics of fermions , however , initially prevented the production of a quantum degenerate fermi gas of atoms . specifically , the challenge came in maintaining the rethermalizing collisions necessary for forced evaporative cooling of the gas  the pauli exclusion principle forbids @xmath4-wave collisions between identical fermions at the ultralow temperatures necessary to reach quantum degeneracy . to circumvent this limitation , the first experiment to produce a quantum degenerate fermi gas @xcite used two spin states of a single fermionic isotope , thus allowing the rethermalizing collisions necessary for evaporative cooling . </S>",
    "<S> sympathetic cooling of fermionic atoms to quantum degeneracy using a thermal bath of bosonic atoms has more recently been demonstrated in systems using @xmath5li and @xmath6li @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we report on the simultaneous trapping of @xmath0k ( a fermion ) and @xmath1rb ( a boson ) using a two - species magneto - optical trap ( mot ) . </S>",
    "<S> this mot will be used as a pre - cooling stage prior to forced evaporation of the @xmath1rb and sympathetic cooling of the @xmath0k gas . to produce the four frequencies of light necessary to operate the mot , we have developed a relatively simple laser scheme that includes the use of a single high power semiconductor amplifier . with this system </S>",
    "<S> we are able to trap @xmath3 @xmath1rb atoms and @xmath7 @xmath0k atoms simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we can monitor either species during the operation of the mot , and have observed number loss in the @xmath0k cloud due to the presence of trapped rubidium .    </S>",
    "<S> a mot for trapping two different elements requires twice as many laser frequencies as a single - species mot . </S>",
    "<S> all of the light for our mot is generated by laser diodes and amplified by a single high power tapered semiconductor amplifier chip ( toptica photonics tae 780 @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the design of the laser system and mot optics exploits the similar wavelengths of the @xmath8 lines in rubidium and potassium , whose energy levels are shown schematically in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : energy_levels ] .    </S>",
    "<S> =3 truein    the generation of the laser light for the @xmath1rb mot begins with a grating - feedback stabilized external cavity diode laser @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the laser generates 20 mw of single mode , narrow - band light . </S>",
    "<S> some of this light is used to frequency lock the laser via saturated absorption spectroscopy to the peak of the @xmath1rb @xmath9 crossover line . </S>",
    "<S> the rest of the light is then frequency shifted via a double - passed 80 mhz acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) , and less than a milliwatt is sent to a second laser diode for injection locking . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining light is then available for optically pumping and/or probing the atom sample .    </S>",
    "<S> the current to the injection locked laser is modulated to create sidebands for hyperfine repumping @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the modulation source is an yttrium iron garnet crystal oscillator ( microsource inc . </S>",
    "<S> mco-0207 ) whose output is coupled into the diode current using a bias  t \" ( picosecond pulse labs 5585 ) . in this way </S>",
    "<S> we produce repump and cycling light for the mot in a single beam and without the need for a second external cavity diode laser . </S>",
    "<S> we can generate repump light on either the @xmath1rb @xmath10 or @xmath11 transition . </S>",
    "<S> up to 10% of the total 780 nm mot light is available for hyperfine repumping , which is sufficient for the @xmath1rb mot .    </S>",
    "<S> the 767 nm light for the @xmath0k mot is also generated using a master - slave injection locking setup . to reach the wavelength of the potassium @xmath8 lines the laser diodes </S>",
    "<S> must be cooled using multiple stages of thermo - electric coolers . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a water heat exchange plate was necessary to cool the slave laser to @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> each laser is housed in a hermetically sealed can with dessicant to prevent water condensation .    </S>",
    "<S> the 767 nm master laser is frequency locked to the peak of a ground state feature of @xmath13k via saturated absorption spectroscopy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining light is then used to injection lock the 767 nm slave laser diode for amplification . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath0k mot typically requires more light for repumping than @xmath1rb due to the small excited state hyperfine splitting @xcite ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : energy_levels ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we found a modulation scheme similar to that described above incapable of stably generating sidebands with @xmath1415% of the total output power . to allow for more @xmath0k repump power , </S>",
    "<S> we instead frequency shift the light from the @xmath15 slave laser via a double - passed 500 mhz aom for repumping . </S>",
    "<S> the unshifted light is double - passed through a 110 mhz aom to generate light on the potassium cycling transition . </S>",
    "<S> the slave laser thus provides enough power to generate both frequencies for the @xmath0k mot .    </S>",
    "<S> high laser power for the mot is obtained using a single tapered semiconductor amplifier chip </S>",
    "<S> . a schematic summary of the laser system is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lasers ] . </S>",
    "<S> this type of single - amplifier system has been used in experiments with two isotopes of a single atom @xcite to provide amplification with up to 12 ghz of bandwidth . in our system </S>",
    "<S> we exploit an amplification bandwidth of @xmath16 . at @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> the chip has an amplified spontaneous emission ( ase ) gain profile centered at 773 nm and with a full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 16 nm . </S>",
    "<S> we measure an amplifier gain of roughly 100 at 767 and 780 nm , and we can vary the amplified powers in the four frequencies by controlling the relative powers of the injected beams . </S>",
    "<S> this system produces all of the light necessary for the two - species mot in a single beam .    </S>",
    "<S> the four frequencies injecting the amplifier are coupled together with a series of polarizing beam splitter cubes and half - wave retardation plates . </S>",
    "<S> adjusting the orientations of the retarders allows simple control of the relative power in each frequency sent to the mot . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : amplifier_spectrum ] shows the optical spectrum of the injected amplifier . </S>",
    "<S> the single beam output from the amplifier is expanded and shaped into a roughly gaussian beam with a @xmath18 diameter of . running the amplifier with 500 mw of total output light results in @xmath19 mw for the mot after beam shaping and spatial filtering . </S>",
    "<S> the beam from the amplifier is then split three ways with each beam retroreflected for the mot .    </S>",
    "<S> = 3.5 truein    =3 truein    the mot itself is formed in a @xmath20 rectangular glass cell , with a one inch diameter window at one end for imaging . </S>",
    "<S> this cell is maintained at a pressure @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> alkali metal dispensers provide the background vapor for the mot . </S>",
    "<S> the dispensers are housed in two glass arms attached to the cell  one for potassium and the other for rubidium . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1rb source is a commercially available dispenser ( saes getters ) , while the potassium source is made in - house from a kcl sample enriched in @xmath0k ( trace sciences international ) , as described previously @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the vapor pressure for each species can be independently controlled by varying the currents used to heat the dispensers .    in characterizing the behavior of the system we began by optimizing each single - species mot for number of trapped atoms . in the case of @xmath1rb , with a peak light intensity of 70 mw/@xmath22 at the mot we are able to trap @xmath3 atoms in the absence of trapped potassium . </S>",
    "<S> the atom number is determined from fluorescence collected onto a photodiode or captured onto a charge coupled device array ( ccd ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1rb cloud is about 5 - 10 mm in diameter . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a detuning of @xmath23 optimizes the number of trapped @xmath1rb atoms , where @xmath24 is the natural linewidth of the @xmath8 lines in rubidium . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above we can repump on either the @xmath1rb @xmath10 or @xmath25 transition . </S>",
    "<S> we measured a slight increase in atom number when repumping on the @xmath25 transition . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field gradient provided by our coils is typically 13 - 18 g / cm .    with no @xmath1rb mot , and with 70 mw/@xmath22 </S>",
    "<S> peak intensity of 767 nm light , we obtain a @xmath0k cloud with @xmath26 atoms , and measuring 0.1 - 0.3 mm in diameter . </S>",
    "<S> the mot is operated at a detuning of @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the natural linewidth of the @xmath8 lines in potassium . </S>",
    "<S> the low @xmath0k number is due to the lower room temperature vapor pressure of potassium . </S>",
    "<S> our previous experience with @xmath0k suggests that more atoms can be trapped by heating the glass cell , however we believe these numbers are sufficient for our purposes . because the @xmath0k gas will be sympathetically cooled in the next stage of the experiment , it is not necessary or desirable to have a relatively large @xmath0k mot .    </S>",
    "<S> the two - species mot is then operated with the same laser detunings and magnetic field gradient used to optimize @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the single - species mots . with these parameters fixed , changing the relative powers in each beam injecting the amplifier </S>",
    "<S> allows us to tune the relative number @xmath31 from 100 - 500 while maintaining at least @xmath32 trapped @xmath0k atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this will enable us to optimize the initial conditions for sympathetic cooling . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0k cloud , which is smaller in diameter , forms completely within the center region of the larger @xmath1rb cloud . </S>",
    "<S> typical conditions of operation and the atom numbers obtained for the single - species and two - species mots are compared in table [ tab : mots ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we can independently monitor either species while the two - species mot operates . </S>",
    "<S> this permits in - situ measurement of @xmath30 and @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> we image fluorescence from the atoms onto a ccd array and use narrow - band optical filters ( cvi laser corp . </S>",
    "<S> f03 - 766.5 - 4 , f03 - 780.0 - 4 ) to selectively view either species . </S>",
    "<S> these filters have center ( transmission ) wavelengths of 767 and 780 nm , respectively , and an optical depth of 4 outside the 3 nm fwhm bandwidth .    by taking a sequence of fluorescence images through the appropriate filter , we observe the time evolution of either cloud in the two - species mot . figure [ fig : number_loss ] shows the results of an experiment monitoring the @xmath0k cloud . </S>",
    "<S> initially all of the mot light is on , but the 780 nm light is locked far off resonance and the @xmath33-field is off so that no trapped atoms are present . after turning on the field and letting the @xmath0k mot evolve for 25 seconds , the 780 nm light is quickly shifted onto the @xmath1rb cycling transition , allowing the rubidium mot to fill . </S>",
    "<S> after ten seconds in the presence of trapped @xmath1rb , the 780 nm light is jumped back off resonance and the @xmath0k mot is allowed to evolve again freely .    </S>",
    "<S> =3 truein    in these data we observe a decrease in @xmath30 of 45% in the presence of the rubidium cloud . </S>",
    "<S> this is attributed to light - assisted heteronuclear collisions in the mot . </S>",
    "<S> a loss rate of 20% has been reported in a @xmath34rb@xmath35k system with more evenly matched number between species @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if we reverse the above experiment to monitor the @xmath1rb cloud for loss in the presence of trapped @xmath0k , we do not observe an effect . </S>",
    "<S> this agrees with the observations reported by the sao carlos group .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated a two - species mot for the simultaneous trapping of @xmath0k and @xmath1rb . this trap will serve as a pre - cooling stage prior to the sympathetic cooling of the @xmath0k to quantum degeneracy . using a relatively simple four - color diode laser scheme and a single high power semiconductor amplifier , atom numbers of @xmath36 and @xmath37 are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we have observed a pronounced number loss in the @xmath0k mot due to heteronuclear collisions in the presence of trapped @xmath1rb atoms . </S>",
    "<S> current work progresses on loading into a purely magnetic trap for evaporative cooling . </S>"
