    "<S> the interaction between vortices is crucial for understanding the formation of vortex lattices in rotating superfluids and is the basic mechanism leading to quantum turbulence _ via _ vortex reconnection @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> vortices have been extensively investigated in atomic gases @xcite , where a variety of techniques permits the observation of single ones up to a few hundreds , interacting in a clean environment and on a spatial scale ranging from the healing length ( core size ) @xmath0 to a few tens of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that atoms are confined by external fields of tunable geometry makes them suitable to explore the physics of reconnection and dissipation in inhomogeneous systems and in the presence of boundaries . </S>",

    "<S> interacting vortices have been observed in nonrotating oblate becs , where vortex lines are short and either parallel or antiparallel , thus behaving as pointlike particles dominated by their long - range interaction in a quasi-2d background @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in our experiment we use a cigar - shaped bec which is particularly suitable for studying the dynamics of vortex lines in 3d . because of the boundary conditions imposed by the tight radial confinement each vortex line lies in a plane perpendicular to the long axis @xmath1 of the trap , such to minimize its length and therefore its energy , as in the solitonic vortex configuration predicted in refs . @xcite and recently observed both in a bec @xcite and in a superfluid fermi gas @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eqn : period ] ) assumes @xmath42 and a rigid straight vortex line , while off - centered vortices actually bend toward the curved bec surface . for rotating condensates the bending mechanism has been discussed in refs . @xcite and observed in ref . </S>",

    "<S> our observations seem to indicate that its effect on the period is small , possibly of the same order of the logarithmic corrections to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn : period ] ) predicted for a straight vortex in a 2d geometry @xcite . this may be due to the fact that the difference in length between a bent and a straight vortex , at a comparable @xmath32 , is relatively small and the overall structure of the vortical flow is also quite similar , so that the key quantities entering the hydrodynamic description ( i.e , the force acting on a unit of length of the vortex and the momentum of the vortex , in the language of ref .  </S>",

    "<S> vortex lifetime in nonrotating becs is limited by scattering of thermal excitations , which causes the dissipation of the vortex energy into the thermal cloud . since a vortex behaves as a particle of negative mass , dissipation causes an antidamping of the orbital motion and vortices decay at the edge of the condensate @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> [ figure4 ] . in some cases </S>",
    "<S> , vortices perform unperturbed oscillations [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure4](a ) ] ; in others , we clearly see a shift in their trajectories at the crossing point [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure4](b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the average relative velocity at the crossing in the latter case is systematically smaller ( @xmath53 mm / s ) than in the former ( @xmath54 mm / s ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the shift has a consequence also in the determination of the orbital period as it causes a broadening of the probability distribution of the ratio @xmath55 which now gives @xmath56 , with a standard deviation three times larger than for the single vortex [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2](g ) ] . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , crossings are frequently associated with a sudden change of visibility of one or both vortices [ figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1](e)-[figure1](h ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , by analyzing the lifetime of vortices for the initial condition @xmath57 and @xmath58 we observe a lifetime @xmath59  ms for the two - vortex configuration , consistent with the one - vortex configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the situation instead changes in the three - vortex configuration , where a faster decay is observed , @xmath60 ms ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure3 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the frequent observation of unperturbed orbits for multiple vortices is intriguing . </S>",
    "<S> two vortex lines moving back and forth in the condensate with random radial orientations should have large probability to cross each other at some point . </S>",
    "<S> if crossings occur , reconnections are expected to take place @xcite with possible drastic ( and almost temperature independent @xcite ) effects on the vortical dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the actual dynamics can strongly depend on the relative angle @xmath61 between vortex lines as well as the relative velocity @xmath62 between the planes where they lie . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath61 is close to @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) , the vortex lines tend to align ( antialign ) , thus reducing the chance of reconnection for vortices on different orbits . </S>",
    "<S> but when vortices approach with @xmath65 reconnection can be hardly avoided . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that we observe the same vortex lifetime for @xmath50 and @xmath44 implies that such reconnections are either suppressed or they induce a negligible dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> a possible explanation is the occurrence of double reconnection processes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> vortex reconnection corresponds to the switching of a pair of locally coplanar vortex lines , accompanied by a change of topology . in our geometry </S>",
    "<S> a finite @xmath62 implies that the newly formed filaments must stretch in the condensate while the two planes separate again after reconnection . </S>",
    "<S> the consequent energy cost is instead avoided if vortices perform a consecutive second reconnection when they are still at close distance . </S>",
    "<S> this would preserve the vortex number , consistent with our observation of an equal vortex lifetime for @xmath50 and @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth mentioning that a similar scenario has also been recently suggested for the collision of cosmic strings @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence of a shift in the trajectories , that apparently depends on @xmath62 , could be associated with the role of the collision time : faster vortices have less time to interact and their trajectories are marginally affected , and this scenario may be applicable both to fly - by vortices and double reconnections . also kelvin modes can be excited in the collision @xcite but , if present , they seem not to affect the lifetime , while they are likely responsible for the change of visibility of the vortices , as they can produce out - of - plane distortions and hence a change of contrast in the density distribution . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the observation of a shorter lifetime in configurations with @xmath66 can be understood by considering the role of a third vortex in the collision of two other vortices , whose tendency to rotate in the radial plane is frustrated by three - body interaction , thus enhancing the probability of collisions and reconnections . </S>",
    "<S> a similar role of three - body interactions in the dynamics of vortices was recently investigated in the context of 2d classical turbulence @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our experimental results demand new theoretical models . </S>",
    "<S> so far , numerical simulations of vortex reconnection are usually performed with vortex lines initially at rest , at small distance , which then evolve in time @xcite , while in our case the role of the relative velocity seems to be crucial . </S>",
    "<S> shedding light on this , and generally on the dynamics of few vortices in such a relatively simple configuration , can help to understand the physics of vorticity in more complex settings , like those of refs .  </S>",
