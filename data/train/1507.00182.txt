    "the demand for mobile broadband is increasing rapidly with emerging applications and services @xcite .",
    "these services require an optimized quality - of - service ( qos ) for efficient network operation .",
    "current state - of - the - art research focuses on traditional techniques such as interference management , cooperative communication and cognitive radio to improve spectrum utilization @xcite .",
    "however , these techniques can not meet the predicted data traffic growth alone without additional spectrum and more pronounced network densification @xcite .",
    "therefore , heterogeneous networks , comprising of small cell base stations ( sbss ) underlying the macrocellular network , constitute a promising solution to improve coverage and boost capacity @xcite @xcite",
    ". however , simply adding small cells incurs high capital and operational expenditures , which limits their deployments . to remedy to this , content caching at the network edge",
    "has recently been identified as one of the five most disruptive paradigms in 5 g networks @xcite .",
    "dynamic caching can significantly offload different parts of the network including the radio access network , core network , and backhaul , by smartly prefetching and storing contents closer to the end - users . as a result ,",
    "network congestion is eased , backhaul is offloaded and users quality - of - experience ( qoe ) is maximized @xcite . + a significant work has been done on content caching in wireless networks . in @xcite ,",
    "the author presented and optimized opportunistic cooperative mimo ( comp ) scheme for wireless video streaming by caching part of video files at the relays . in @xcite",
    ", data is cached on different wireless caches with limited storage capabilities and the performance of uncoded and coded data transmission is evaluated by minimizing the distance to retrieve the complete data file .",
    "collaborative caching is presented in @xcite where the social welfare is maximized using vickrey - clarke - groves ( vcg ) auctions .",
    "femtocaching was proposed in @xcite where caching helpers store popular contents optimally , thus improving frequency reuse . @xcite",
    "examined proactive caching by prefetching contents on different network elements , thus providing substantial gains in terms of backhaul savings and satisfied users .",
    "@xcite evaluates the performance of caching on helper stations / devices and optimize video quality by devising optimal storage schemes .",
    "@xcite estimates the loss rate in content delivery networks and proposes several replication methods .",
    "most of the works above consider fixed location of caches . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", @xcite was the first work to study stochastic geometric approaches to caching . however ,",
    "this work did nt address the optimization of sbs density as a function of cache size and distance .",
    "@xcite also considers content caching from a stochastic geometry perspective .",
    "however , instead of link reliability , it considers the distance to retrieve all parts of the requested file , without taking interference into account .",
    "+ unlike @xcite and @xcite , this paper investigates the problem of content caching in dense small cell networks ( scns ) , from a stochastic geometry perspective .",
    "sbss are randomly deployed in the network according to a poisson point process ( ppp ) , and store a limited number of contents , from a library . by assuming a single user located at the origin of the network",
    ", we derive a closed form expression of the outage probability , as a function of the sbs density , storage size and threshold distance .",
    "the outage probability is defined as the probability of accessing a specific content , cached in a given coverage area , subject to a given signal - to - interference ( sir)-dependent coverage probability . moreover , for a given target cache hit probability , we derive a closed form expression of the outage probability assuming the closest sbs is within the area defined by threshold distance . by assuming a given threshold distance and cache size , we characterize the optimum number of sbss required to achieve a target outage probability , and derive a number of insights .",
    "+ the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : sys_mod ] describes the system model where the network and channel models are presented . in section",
    "[ sec : out_pro_form ] , the content outage probability is formalized and the optimum sbs density is characterized , for a fixed replication ratio and threshold distance to achieve a target cache hit probability . finally , numerical results are presented in section [ sec : num_res_dis ] along with simulation results .",
    "consider the downlink transmission of a wireless small cell network comprising of sbss in a two dimensional euclidean plane @xmath0 , as shown in fig . [ fig : net_diagram1 ] .",
    "the distribution of sbss is modeled as a homogeneous ppp , @xmath1 with intensity @xmath2 where each sbs is equipped with a cache of size @xmath3 , to cache contents from a given library @xmath4 with size @xmath5 .",
    "all contents are assumed to be of the same size .",
    "we assume the content popularity to follow a uniform distribution where each content is equally popular . as a result ,",
    "each sbs randomly selects and caches contents from the library .      without loss of generality",
    ", we consider a single user equipment ( ue ) located at the origin of the network , termed as a _ reference user _",
    "( also known as _ tagged user _ ) .",
    "such reference user has a threshold distance @xmath6 that specifies the maximum distance over which its content request can be served .",
    "the reference user is associated to the nearest sbs with the cached content within @xmath6 . if no sbs caches the requested content , an outage event occurs . to simplify the mathematical analysis",
    ", we further consider that the original process @xmath1 contributes only to the interference field since the reference link is not part of the original ppps .",
    "for this reason , the reference link emulates the user association process by assuming that the distance between the reference sbs and the reference user follows the distribution of the closest sbs having the cached content , conditioned on its existence .",
    "+ the standard power loss propagation channel model is used with path loss exponent @xmath7 . in order to account for the random channel effects such as fading and shadowing",
    ", we consider a rayleigh fading channel in which the channel gain from sbs @xmath8 to a reference user is @xmath9 , which is an exponential random variable with mean 1 .",
    "we consider a constant transmit power per sbs .",
    "moreover , we assume an interference - limited regime and neglect the effect of additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) .",
    "the sir from sbs @xmath8 to the reference user is given as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the random distance between the reference ue and sbs @xmath8 and @xmath12 is the path loss exponent .",
    "+ the performance of the system depends on several factors such as @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath3 .",
    "a high sbs density increases the cache hit probability at the cost of an increased interference .",
    "meanwhile , increasing the threshold distance increases the coverage area of a given user , leading to a high cache hit .",
    "however , the sir decreases with the increased distance ( assuming free space path loss ) .",
    "additionally , a large cache size increases the cache hit without affecting the interference for the same number of sbss .",
    "the goal of the work is to maximize the cache hit probability while achieving a pre - defined sir threshold based on the system parameters such as @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath3 . in the following section ,",
    "the analytical results that capture such tradeoffs are presented .",
    "in this section , after defining the coverage probability and cache hit probability , we optimize the sbs density to achieve a target cache hit probability based on the threshold distance and replication ratio . in addition",
    ", we derive the outage probability of getting a specific content .",
    "the replication ratio , denoted by @xmath13 , is the fraction of the library contents stored by the sbs . in this paper",
    ", we assume a uniform content replication so that the replication ratio is the same for every content @xmath14 and it is given by : @xmath15 note that , as far as the uniform replication is assumed , the ratio @xmath13 is equal to the probability of having a given content @xmath14 in the sbs cache , with size @xmath3 .",

    "the cache hit probability is defined as the probability of existence of a given content within @xmath6 .",
    "the cache hit probability within a threshold distance @xmath6 , is represented by @xmath22 and is given by : @xmath23 this equation ensures the probability of existence of at least one sbs in the coverage area of the user having the requested content . to achieve a given target cache hit probability",

    "[ fig : outage_repratio_sbsdensity ] shows the effect of sbs density on the outage probability for various replication ratios .",
    "the figure shows that an increased number of sbss , at a constant threshold distance , results in increased outage probability due to increased interference .",
    "another implication from the result suggests that the outage probability becomes constant with an increased sbs density . when sbss cache few contents with a small replication ratio , interference is the dominating factor . assuming a fixed replication ratio while increasing the sbs density , the effect of interference is increased",
    ". meanwhile , an increased replication ratio , for a fixed sbs density , increases the hit probability because each sbs caches a higher proportion of library contents , which decreases the outage probability .",
    "[ fig : outage_repratio_sbsdensity ] shows the variation of outage probability as a function of the replication ratio . with an increased replication ratio , the outage probability decreases as each sbs caches a large proportion of the library contents .",
    "it can also be seen that for a small sbs density and a small replication ratio , the outage probability is very low .",
    "the low value of outage probability is due to the aggregate effect of interference and cache hit probability . theoretically , a small sbs density with a small replication ration decreases the hit probability .",
    "as the interference effect is very small at a small sbs density , the cache hit probability is the dominating factor .",
    "[ fig : outage_distance ] shows the effect of coverage radius @xmath35 on the outage probability for various replication ratios .",
    "this demonstrates that the outage probability increases with the threshold distance .",
    "if the threshold distance increases , the number of sbss increases and the hit probability for the content increases . however , with an increased distance , the link reliability decreases due to increased interference .",
    "another insight drawn from the figure is that with increased replication ratio , the outage probability decreases as every sbs caches most of the library contents .",
    "in addition , the outage probability levels off , as the threshold distance is increased beyond 10 m .",
    "this is due to the fact that as the distance is increased , the effect of interference becomes negligible .",
    "[ fig : outage_sbsdensity_distance ] shows the variation of outage probability with distance for different sbs density . as the threshold distance",
    "is increased , the outage probability increases due to the higher interference level . further increasing the distance",
    "improves the hit probability at the cost of more interference , thereby impacting the outage probability . besides , with the increased sbs density , the outage probability increases due to increased interference from the sbss .",
    "[ fig : outage_repratio_sirthreshold ] presents the variation of outage probability with respect to sir threshold for different replication ratios .",
    "it can be seen that with the increased sir threshold , the outage probability increases .",
    "the increased sir threshold relaxes the interference requirement , resulting in an increased outage .",
    "meanwhile , the outage converges to 1 as the sir threshold increases .",
    "however , the convergence is faster for small replication ratio .",
    "the fast convergence for small replication is due to the fact that the effect of interference is dominating than the caches of sbss .",
    "[ fig : outage_sirthreshold_sbsdensity ] shows the variation of outage probability with sir threshold for different sbs density .",
    "it can be seen that the outage probability increases with sir threshold as the sbs density is increased .",
    "the increased sir threshold lessens the interference requirement , resulting in an increased outage .",
    "in addition , the outage probability coverges to 1 irrespective of the sbs density .",
    "however , the convergence rate for small sbs density is less than the convergence rate for large sbs density . for small sbs density ,",
    "the aggregate interference of sbss is much smaller instead of large sbss density .",
    "[ fig : opt_sbs_distance ] shows the optimum number of sbss as a function of target hit probability for a given @xmath6 and @xmath13 , given by corollary [ coro_1 ] .",
    "the first implication , from the figure , suggests that an increased threshold distance requires a small sbs density for a given replication ratio . with the increased threshold distance ,",
    "a large number of sbss becomes available in the coverage area of ue , thus , requiring small sbs density .",
    "however , the exponential behavior of the curve for large distance suggests that it is quite challenging to achieve a high target cache hit probability for such large threshold distance .",
    "in addition , the figure reveals that with an increased target cache hit probability , the sbs density for different distances varies slowly and the optimum sbs density converges .",
    "[ fig : opt_sbs_repratio ] shows the optimum number of sbss required to achieve a target hit probability at a fixed distance for different replication ratios .",
    "it can be seen that a high replication ratio decreases the number of sbss as many sbss caches most of the library contents",
    ". meanwhile , it is difficult to obtain a highest target cache hit probability for a small replication ratio .",
    "therefore , small distances and replication ratios require a high sbs density for a given target cache hit probability . moreover , the figure reveals that as the replication ratio is increased , the variation in the sbs density becomes smaller to achieve a target cache hit probability .",
    "in this paper , we studied a cache enabled small cell network comprising of sbss that store contents from a library . by considering the distribution of sbss to be a ppp , we derived the outage probability of getting the requested content over a threshold distance .",
    "in addition , we characterized the optimum number of sbss to achieve a target hit probability .",
