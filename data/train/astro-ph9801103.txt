    "while white dwarf halo mass fractions which exceed these limits might be obtained with specially tailored assumptions @xcite , ultimately it may be necessary to consider more exotic candidates for the machos .",
    "in particular , jedamzik has recently proposed that horizon - size black hole formation from primordial density fluctuations could operate particularly efficiently during a first - order qcd phase transition @xcite .",
    "a first - order confinement transition involves the coexistence of quark - gluon and hadron phases @xcite . on large scales , the pressure response of this `` mixed '' phase is greatly reduced : when compressed , the energy density does not increase from increases in pressure and temperature , which remain constant . instead",
    ", low density hadron phase is exchanged for high energy density quark - gluon phase .",
    "because of the reduced pressure response , the required overdensity for black hole formation is smaller . for fluctuations entering the horizon during this epoch , statistically more abundant , lower amplitude perturbations could form black holes , leading to a peak in the primordial black hole ( pbh ) mass spectrum at the qcd epoch horizon mass . since the horizon mass is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom at cosmological temperature @xmath12 , pbhs formed at the qcd transition temperature @xmath13 mev could be in the right mass range to be machos .",
    "this possibility takes on added interest in view of the claim that galactic halos filled with @xmath3 black holes could bring about enough nearby bh - bh mergers to cause a few events / year in the first generation network of gravitational wave interferometers @xcite .",
    "other than a general guess that the critical overdensity for collapse would be reduced by a factor of order unity during the qcd transition @xcite , no quantitative estimate of this reduction factor has appeared .",
    "a relativistic numerical calculation is in preparation @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to use a simplified model to estimate this reduction factor , and to assess the cosmological significance of the resulting peak in the pbh mass spectrum .",
    "a heuristic criterion for gravitational collapse to a black hole of an overdense region of energy density @xmath14 and size @xmath15 was given by carr and hawking @xcite .",
    "these authors argued that collapse would ensue when the `` gravitational energy '' @xmath16 was large enough to overcome the `` kinetic energy '' of expansion and the pressure forces ( here @xmath17 is the gravitational constant ) .",
    "the overdense region expands more slowly than the average cosmological expansion , and eventually turns around and begins to collapse .",
    "carr and hawking consider the region at the moment of turnaround ( when the kinetic energy of expansion is zero ) , and account for the pressure forces by comparing the gravitational energy to the `` internal energy . ''",
    "this `` internal energy '' is approximated as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the pressure and an equation of state of the form @xmath20 is assumed ( @xmath21 is a constant ) .",

    "this condition can also be written @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the jeans length .",
    "however , the overdense region can not be larger than the horizon size at turnaround , or it will constitute a separate universe , causally disconnected from our own , and would not be relevant to this discussion .    for radiation ( @xmath26 )",
    ", the size of the overdense region at turnaround , its schwarzschild radius , the jeans length , and the cosmological horizon size are all of the same order of magnitude .",

    "( w=0 ) , the jeans length is much smaller than the horizon size , and centrifugal and turbulent forces could prevent full collapse to a black hole .",
    "if a hole does form in this case it could be much smaller than the horizon mass .",
    "the condition for an overdense region to collapse to a black hole is expressed above in terms of the density and size of the region at turnaround . however , cosmological density perturbations are typically classified by specifying their overdensity @xmath28 when they enter the horizon , where @xmath14 is the energy density of the overdense region and @xmath29 is the average cosmological density . for assessing the cosmological significance of the black hole population",

    "the chiral symmetry breaking event remains the prime candidate for such a transition , though the lattice gauge calculation results on this issue remain unsettled .",
    "for illustrative purposes , we will assume that there is a first order phase transition associated with this epoch in the early universe .",
    "the qcd era is promising for primordial black hole production , since phase separation at this time implies that the duration of a first order phase transition will be ( essentially ) a gravitational timescale .",
    "a bag - like picture employing a qcd vacuum energy provides a simple description of a first order qcd phase transition with critical transition temperature @xmath51 .",

    "this is the start of the phase transition .    for the purpose of assessing the probability of black hole formation during the qcd epoch",
    ", we will consider the following further caricature of the behavior of the plasma through the transition .",
    "for energy densities greater than @xmath68 , take the plasma to be radiation with @xmath69 .",
    "this ignores the vacuum energy density @xmath58 , which at @xmath70 contributes about 18% of the total . for energy densities in the range @xmath71",
    ", we can treat the plasma as dust . here",
    "@xmath68 and @xmath72 correspond to the energy densities in the plasma at the start and conclusion of the phase transition , respectively .",
    "even though the pressure itself is not zero , the almost negligible pressure response of the plasma during the transition leads to the dust - like evolution noted above . for densities",
    "less than @xmath72 , we treat the plasma as radiation with @xmath73 .",
    "the duration of the transition can be obtained by comparing the cosmic scale factor at the beginning ( @xmath66 ) and end ( @xmath74 ) of the transtion . from the conservation of co - moving entropy density",
    "we obtain @xmath75 , so the transition is fairly short .",
    "an overdense region that goes through the transition during its collapse does not correspond to the cases discussed in the previous subsection , i.e. either radiation or dust throughout the collapse .",
    "how should the condition for collapse to a black hole be modified in this case ? based on the above caricature of the behavior of the plasma around the transition , we suggest modifying the `` internal energy '' of eq .",
    "( [ inteng ] ) to @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the fraction of the overdense region s `` evolution volume '' spent in the dust - like transition epoch .",
    "for example , letting @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively denote the size of the initially expanding overdense region at the beginning and end of the phase transition , @xmath80 for an overdense region that has completed the transition before turnaround . put another way , for an overdense region that obeys @xmath42 for much of its evolution and a dust - like phase for the rest , we define an effective jeans length @xmath81 at turnaround . in terms of the overdensity of the fluctuation at horizon crossing , the condition for collapse can be expressed @xmath82 therefore , the larger the fraction of a fluctuation s evolution time which is spent in the mixed phase regime , the smaller the required initial horizon crossing perturbation amplitude for collapse to a black hole.the evaluation of this collapse criterion will be the subject of sec .",
    "[ sec : crit ] . note that in our analysis we have assumed that at no time is the universe ever dominated by the qcd vacuum energy @xmath58 .",
    "were such a vacuum - dominated condition to arise , then a kind of mini - inflationoccurs , where the scale factor can increase exponentially with time@xcite .",
    "however , in this case the nucleation rate for bubbles of low temperature phase will increase very rapidly with time and decreasing temperature , with the result that the fraction @xmath77 will likely be smaller than in the non - vacuum - dominated case .",
    "`` top - hat '' perturbations are completely specified by @xmath30their overdensity when they enter the horizon  and by the cosmological time at which horizon crossing occurs . here",
    "we will find it convenient to use the average cosmological energy density at horizon crossing @xmath83 rather than the time of horizon crossing .",
    "in particular , we use the variable @xmath84 to identify the epoch of horizon crossing , where @xmath85 .",
    "again , @xmath68 is the energy density above which the plasma is pure quark - gluon phase , and @xmath72 is the density below which the plasma is pure hadron phase .",
    "we define the constant @xmath86",
    ". then perturbations with @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 enter the horizon when the average cosmological background_not _ the overdense region itself  is in quark - gluon , mixed quark - gluon / hadron , and hadron phase , respectively .",
    "in addition , our description of the collapse of an overdense region involves two important events : ( 1 ) the region s",
    "horizon crossing , and ( 2 ) its turnaround , when it stops expanding and begins to recollapse .",
    "the state of the matter at these two events constitute various classes of perturbations ; these are listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "given the characteristics of an overdense region , @xmath30 and @xmath84 , we can specify the class a - f to which it belongs .",
    "the classes of perturbations that exist for various epochs of horizon crossing and values of @xmath30 are shown in table [ tab2 ] . from the information in this table",
    "two curves can be drawn in the @xmath90 plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "classes a , b , and c are separated from classes d and e by the curve @xmath91 , and classes d and e are separated from class f by the curve @xmath92 .",
    "these divisions are based on the state of matter in the overdense region when it enters the horizon .",
    "in contrast , the curves in the @xmath93 plane separating classes a and b , b and c , and d and e are based on the state of matter in the overdense region at turnaround .",
    "for example , the boundary between classes a and b is determined by @xmath94 , that is , by the condition that an overdense region entering the horizon in the quark - gluon phase just reaches the density for the phase transition to begin when it begins to recollapse . the condition @xmath95 using eq .",
    "( [ sc ] ) with @xmath26 yields the curve defined by @xmath96 the other curves can be obtained in a similar manner , with the complication that changes in the density evolution between radiation ( @xmath97 ) and dust ( @xmath98 ) , and/or vice - versa , must be followed when the density reaches @xmath68 and/or @xmath72 respectively . the analysis leading to eq .",
    "( [ sc ] ) can then be generalized in a straightforward manner .",
    "the curve defining the boundary between classes b and c is @xmath99 and the boundary between classes d and e is defined by @xmath100 these last two curves are valid only in the regions above and below the curve separating classes a , b , and c from classes d and e , respectively .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the @xmath90 plane divided into regions that constitute classes a - f .",
    "class a has no dust - like phase , and @xmath101 for collapse .",
    "class d does not exist for @xmath102 , so perturbations of this class would be expected to collapse even without the dust - like phase .",
    "therefore , interesting reductions in the critical value of @xmath30 for collapse to a black hole are possible for classes b , c , e , and f.    for reference , the expressions for the turnaround radius @xmath103 for the various classes are given in table [ tab3 ] .",

    "<S> it has recently been suggested that cosmologically significant numbers of black holes could form during a first - order qcd phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> further , it has been asserted that these black holes would have masses corresponding naturally to the inferred mass ( @xmath0 ) of the machos responsible for the observed gravitational microlensing events . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> the underlying spectrum of primordial density perturbations provides the fluctuations that give rise to black holes at the epoch of the qcd transition . </S>",
    "<S> we employ a simplified model to estimate the reduction in the critical overdensity of a horizon - sized primordial perturbation required for collapse to a black hole . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a first - order qcd transition does indeed produce a sharp peak in the black hole mass spectrum , but that this peak corresponds to the horizon mass at an epoch somewhat earlier than the cosmological transition itself . assuming a cobe normalized primordial density perturbation spectrum with constant spectral index , for the black holes so produced to be cosmologically significant would require an extremely finely tuned `` blue '' primordial density perturbation spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , in the context of our simplified model , a spectral index in the range @xmath1 corresponds to the range @xmath2 of the black hole contribution to the present - day density parameter . </S>"
