    "the standard model of electroweak and strong interactions is in excellent agreement with the experimental data and has explained many features of particle physics throughout the years . however , despite its success , there are some fundamental questions that remain unexplained as , for instance , the enormous range of masses between the lightest and heaviest fermions . in order to explain these aspects many models have been proposed assuming the introduction of new fields or symmetries as , for example , the extension of the standard model based on @xmath8@xcite .",
    "this class of models predicts interesting new physics at tev scale @xcite and addresses some fundamental questions that can not be explained in the framework of the standard model @xcite .",
    "in refs.@xcite it was suggested that the gauge symmetry breaking of a specific version of a 3 - 3 - 1 model @xcite would be implemented dynamically because at the scale of a few tevs the @xmath0 coupling constant becomes strong and the exotic quark @xmath9 introduced in the model forms a condensate breaking @xmath10 to the electroweak symmetry .",
    "this possibility was explored in the ref.@xcite assuming a model based on the gauge symmetry @xmath11 , where the electroweak symmetry is broken dynamically by a technifermion condensate , that is characterized by the @xmath12 technicolor(tc ) gauge group . in ref.@xcite",
    "it was computed the mass generated for the charged and neutral gauge bosons of the model that result from this symmetry breaking , and it was verified the equivalence between a 3 - 3 - 1 model with a scalar content formed by the set of the fundamental scalar bosons @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite with a version where the full dynamical symmetry breaking is implemented by a set of composite bosons @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the model described above is not the most economical from the point of view of the scalar content required to promote the dynamical symmetry breaking , because , as commented in @xcite , the minimal scalar content is fixed by the cancellation of triangular anomaly condition in the tc sector , independently of the cancellation that occur in the standard fermionic sector . in this paper",
    "we just propose a new scheme to cancel chiral anomalies in the sector assigned to tc with the ordinary fermionic sector of the model , i.e. in order to make the model anomaly free we will assume that the three quark generations transform as @xmath17 , whereas the three lepton generations and the technifermion multiplet @xmath18 transform as @xmath19 of @xmath20 .",
    "the key to produce this cancellation scheme is also consistent with the conditions to have a tc model that incorporates the so called walking behavior @xcite .",
    "usually the walking behavior is obtained assuming a large number of technifermions , @xmath21 , if technifermions are in the fundamental representation of the tc gauge group @xcite , when we deal with the @xmath22 technicolor group . moreover ,",
    "recently sannino et .",
    "al . showed that it is possible to obtain the walking behavior for a small number of technifermions if these are in higher dimensional representations of the tc gauge group@xcite which is precisely the case that we are considering in this work .    at this point",
    "we should emphasize that the choice of representations leading to the walking behavior displayed by the tc theory is not only essential to produce the model s anomaly cancellation , it is also crucial to promote the full dynamical symmetry breaking . due to our choice for the fermionic content of the model , the exotic quarks @xmath23 do not lead to the critical coupling constant value necessary to promote the dynamical symmetry breaking of @xmath24 to the standard model at the @xmath3 scale .",
    "however , the full gap equation for the  exotic techniquark @xmath25 \" takes also into account , besides the @xmath26 interaction , the tc interaction .",
    "due to the walking behavior , at the scale of order @xmath27tev the value of coupling constant @xmath28 is still large enough , together with the @xmath26 interaction @xmath29 , to promote the dynamical symmetry breaking of @xmath30 to the standard model .",
    "so , in this case , it is the combined effect of the @xmath26 interaction of @xmath25 with the tc interaction ( with walking behavior ) which produces the dynamical symmetry breaking of the @xmath30 to @xmath31 , while the electroweak symmetry is broken dynamically by the technifermion condensate .    in order to verify the influence of the walking behavior in the symmetry breaking of @xmath30 to @xmath31 , we will assume two possible values for the scale where the degrees of freedom associated with the 3 - 3 - 1 model become relevant : a ) @xmath32 and b ) @xmath33 .",
    "the most interesting effects occur for the situation ( a ) , where tc still has significant influence due to the walking behavior . in this case",
    "strong effects in the tc sector , as the existence of a dynamical mass scale for technigluons@xcite , can directly affect the phenomenology of this class of models , in the sense that @xmath34 is limited by the existence of a technigluon mass scale .",
    "this paper is composed as follows : in section ii we present the fermionic content of the model . in section iii",
    "we obtain the gap equation for @xmath25 . in the section",
    "iv we determine the mass generated for the charged gauge bosons of the model(@xmath35 ) that result from the symmetry breaking assuming the charged current interactions associated to the technifermions , we also determine the masses generated for the neutral gauge bosons ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "finally , in section v we draw our conclusions .",
    "the fermionic content of this model is analogous to the one proposed in ref.@xcite , moreover in this case the three quarks generations transform as @xmath37 , with the singlets @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the leptonic sector includes , besides the conventional charged leptons and their respective neutrinos , charged heavy leptons @xmath41 , transforming as @xmath42 , with @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the family generation and @xmath46 , @xmath47 or @xmath48 denote the transformation properties under @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the corresponding @xmath26 charge .    the main difference between this model version and the one of ref.@xcite is related to the tc sector .",
    "the minimal technicolor sector is now represented by & & _",
    "ij__l = (    c u__ij + d__ij + u__ij    ) _ l~(*6 * , * 3 * , 1/2 ) +   + & & u_ij__r ~ ( * 6 * , * 1 * , 1/2),d_ij__r~(*6 * , * 1 * , -1/2 ) , + & & u_ij__r ~ ( * 6*,*1 * , 3/2 ) .",
    "and @xmath51 is the two - index symmetric representation ( * 6 * ) of @xmath52 .",
    "the model is anomaly free if we have equal number of triplets ( * 3 * ) and anti triplets ( @xmath53 ) , counting the color of @xmath54 and the technicolor charge in the case of technifermions @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to make the model anomaly free , the three quark generations transform as @xmath17 , whereas the three lepton generations and the technifermion multiplet @xmath18 transform as @xmath19 of @xmath20 .",
    "the advantage of the model described in this paper relative to the model ref.@xcite is that it is most economical from the point of view of the scalar content required to promote the dynamical symmetry breaking . in the ref.@xcite",
    "the dynamical symmetry breaking is implemented by a set of composite bosons @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and in that case the minimal composite scalar content is fixed by the condition of the cancellation of triangular anomaly in the tc sector .    on the lines below we present the anomaly - free conditions of our model & & tr[su(3)_c]^2[u(1)_x ] = _ _ c x_c_l - _ _ c x_c_r = 0 + & & tr[su(3)__tc]^2[u(1)_x ] = _ _ t x_t_l - _ _ t x_t_r = 0 + & & tr[su(3)_l]^2[u(1)_x ] = _ _ k x_k_l = 0 + & & tr[u(1)_x]^3 = _ _ k x^3_k_l - _ _ k x^3_k_r = 0 , where the index @xmath55 represents a sum over all fermionic hipercharges , while the sum indicated by @xmath56 and @xmath57 are related with fermions that carry degrees of freedom of color and technicolor respectively .    in order to determine the spectrum of composite scalars of the model we will assume the most attractive channel(mac ) hypothesis@xcite . for @xmath0 the mac should satisfy @xmath58 , and once @xmath59 is close to 1 , we can roughly estimate that @xmath0 condensation should occur only for the channel where @xmath60 . since [ ( @xmath61 the exotic quarks @xmath23 does not lead to the critical coupling with the necessary value to promote the dynamical symmetry breaking of @xmath62 to the standard model . at this energy scale @xmath63 , and we do not expect the formation of @xmath52 condensate @xmath64 . thus , assuming the statements made in this paragraph we avoid the complexity of taking into account the problem of vacuum alignment .    as we will show in the following section , the full gap equation for @xmath25 takes also into account , besides the @xmath26 interaction , the tc interaction .",
    "due to the choice of the tc fermionic representation , the tc theory coupling constant ( @xmath65 ) exhibits a walking behavior , and at the scale of order @xmath66tev its value is still large enough",
    ". the value of this coupling together with the one of the @xmath26 interaction ( @xmath29 ) , when added in the expression for the gap equation are enough to promote the dynamical symmetry breaking of @xmath30 to standard model . in other words ,",
    "the combined effect of the @xmath26 interaction of @xmath25 with tc interaction ( with walking behavior ) is the mechanism responsible for promoting the dynamical symmetry breaking of the @xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , the dynamical symmetry breaking of @xmath30 to the standard model in this model is implemented by the composite scalar triplet @xmath67 , and the electroweak symmetry is broken dynamically by a technifermion condensate , @xmath68 , which in this case is given by the composite scalar doublet @xmath69 .",
    "assuming only the @xmath26 interaction , we can write the schwinger - dyson equation for the @xmath25 quark as @xcite @xmath70 where we consider the rainbow approximation for the vertex @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 . in this expression @xmath75 and @xmath76 are respectively @xmath77 charges attributed to the chiral components of the @xmath25 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 . to simplify the calculations it is convenient to choose the landau gauge , and in this case the @xmath4 propagator can be written as id^__m_z(p - k ) = -i",
    ".    however , as we mentioned in the last section , the full gap equation for @xmath25 must also take into account the tc interaction of @xmath25 , and we can write this contribution in the form s^-1_u_tc(p ) = /p -i^_as(k)^_b^ab_,m_tg(p - k ) where @xmath80 , the scale of @xmath30 dynamical symmetry breaking is written as @xmath81 , @xmath82 are gell - mann matrices and the technigluon propagator in landau gauge and in euclidean space is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 which is a solution for the gluon propagator consistent with lattice simulations and schwinger - dyson equations @xcite .",
    "the momentum dependence of the technigluon mass will be neglected in the following , because its effect is quite small in the calculations that we will perform .",
    "note that in pure gauge theories the existence of dynamical gauge boson mass generation is well accepted by now @xcite , however in the present case we are considering an almost conformal tc theory with the @xmath2 technifermions , and in this case it is possible that the effect of fermion loops erase part of the gauge boson loops effects generating a smaller dynamical technigluon mass .",
    "this last point will be discussed again afterwards , meanwhile we can make an useful approximation in our gap equations + , + which is known as the angle approximation @xcite . with this approximation and using the eqs.(6 - 8 )",
    "we can write the following expression for the dynamical mass @xmath85 of the @xmath25 fermion m_u(p^2 ) & = & dk^2k^2 a(p^2 , k^2 , m^2_z ) + & + & dk^2k^2 b(p^2 , k^2 , m^2_tg ) , [ eqa ]    where we defined & & a(p^2 , k^2 , m^2_z ) ( + ) + & & b(p^2 , k^2 , m^2_tg ) ( + ) . and @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "besides the two kernels present in eq.([eqa ] ) it is possible that we should also add some confinement effect in the tc sector , as discussed in ref.@xcite , introducing into the gap equation an effective confining propagator given by d_eff^(k ) ^ d_eff ( k ) ; d_eff ( k)= .",
    "[ eq01 ] where this confining effect is not related to the propagation of an elementary field , @xmath88 is the string tension for fermions in the representation @xmath89 and @xmath90 is proportional to the dynamical fermion mass @xcite .",
    "however in this particular case the tc fermions in the * 6 * representation may also produce screening of the confining force , and it is not clear , up to now , how to take this effect into account @xcite . independently of this effect , which can only increase the conditions for the tc group chiral symmetry breaking",
    ", we will show that eq.([eqa ] ) has enough strength to bifurcate and to generate a  walking type \" solution .    assuming the gap equation described in ( 9 ) we can now proceed analogously to refs.@xcite in order to obtain the bifurcation equation of the @xmath25 , and verify at what point the nontrivial solution of eq.(9 ) bifurcates away from trivial solution characterizing the dynamical symmetry breaking of the model . substituting ( @xmath91 by @xmath92 in the denominators of eq.([eqa ] ) , where the value of dynamical mass @xmath93 at the scale of dynamic symmetry breaking of the @xmath30 symmetry is defined by the normalization @xmath94 we arrive at the bifurcation equation for @xmath25 m_u(p^2 ) & = & dk^2a(p^2 , k^2 , m^2_z ) + & + & dk^2b(p^2 , k^2 , m^2_tg ) .    defining the new variables",

    "as in the kernel described in ref.@xcite , the eq.(13 ) contains the sum of two contributions , corresponding in this case to the @xmath26 interaction ( @xmath104 ) and to the tc interaction ( with walking behavior ) ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "our main aim in this section is to verify the gross critical behavior of the gap equation including the walking behavior displayed by the tc sector of the model .",
    "this point is important because the @xmath26 interaction , due to the fermionic representations that we have chosen , is not strong enough to promote the dynamical symmetry breaking by itself , as happens in the models of ref.@xcite .",
    "the bifurcation condition is depicted in figs.(1a ) and ( 1b ) for two different choices of the energy scale assigned to the 3 - 3 - 1 model , ( a ) @xmath106 and ( b)@xmath107 . to obtain these curves we calculated the running of @xmath65 giving @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and with the casimir operator for the representation @xmath110 of @xmath52 given by @xmath111 .",

    "<S> the gauge symmetry breaking in some versions of 3 - 3 - 1 models can be implemented dynamically because at the scale of a few tevs the @xmath0 coupling constant becomes strong . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we consider the dynamical symmetry breaking in a minimal @xmath1 model , where we propose a new scheme to cancel the chiral anomalies , including two - index symmetric ( @xmath2 ) technifermions , which incorporates naturally the walking behavior in the tc sector . </S>",
    "<S> the composite scalar content of the model is minimal and all the symmetry breaking is implemented by a multiplet of technifermions . the choice of tc representations not only provide the anomaly cancellation with a walking behavior , but is crucial to promote the model s full dynamical symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the dynamical generation of technigluon masses and , depending on the 3 - 3 - 1 symmetry breaking scale ( @xmath3 ) , we verify that the technigluon mass is strongly linked to the @xmath4 mass scale , for instance , if @xmath5 , we have @xmath6 tev only if @xmath7 . </S>"
