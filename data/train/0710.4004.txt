    "the equations of point vortices motion in the plane were introduced by helmholtz @xcite and described as an hamiltonian system by kirchhoff in 1876 @xcite .",
    "these equations were first generalized to describe the motion of point - vortices on a sphere by bogolmonov in 1977 @xcite .",
    "bogomolnov s work was put into solid mathematical grounds by kimura and okamoto in 1987 @xcite . independently hally wrote in 1979 @xcite the equations for vortices motion in symmetric surfaces of revolution ( which englobe the sphere ) . to write his equations hally represented the surface @xmath2 on the complex plane with a metric conformal to the euclidean metric : let the @xmath3-th vortex , with vorticity @xmath4 be represented by the complex coordinate @xmath5 .",
    "calling the surface s conformal factor @xmath6 , hally s equations are @xmath7 the difficulty in working with these equations is that one must know explicitly the conformal factor @xmath6 and this factor is not known for many surfaces but the sphere .",
    "the aim of this paper is to write the equations for the n - vortex problem on the ellipsoid of revolution @xmath8 as an @xmath9-series when @xmath10 . to achieve this goal",
    "we write a perturbative coordinate transformation from the ellipsoid into the plane ( see ( [ trans]))and impose conformality at each order .",
    "it turns out that the transformation s n - th order term is given by the solution of a certain linear differential equation and that the first order term can be computed explicitly ( see ( [ equapert ] ) ) . using hally s equations we calculated rigorously the first order perturbation term for the vortex equations on the ellipsoid .",
    "in spherical coordinates the truncated first order equations are given by the hamiltonian system with hamiltonian @xmath11 where @xmath12 \\ , , \\ ] ] @xmath13\\ ] ] and symplectic two - form @xmath14    the paper is organized as follows : in section ( [ hallysec ] ) we introduce all the concepts used in the derivation of the vortex equations .",
    "hally s equations are written as an invariant hamiltonian system and , for the spherical case , are shown to be equivalent to bogolmonov s equations . in section ( [ pertubative ] ) we derive the expression for the first order perturbation term .",
    "the main idea is to write the conformal transformation from the ellipsoid into the plane as a formal series in the eccentricity of the generating ellipse of the ellipsoid . in section ( [ aplicacao ] )",
    "we exhibit two simple applications of equations ( [ central ] ) .",
    "the case @xmath15 , despite being integrable , seems not to admit closed solutions .",
    "we show that , when @xmath16 , the only solutions for which the two vortices maintain their relative distance constant are the relative equilibria . for the @xmath17 case ,",
    "we show numerically , by choosing specific parameters , that the three - vortices problem ( [ central ] ) on the ellipsoid is chaotic .",
    "in this section we discuss equations ( [ hally0 ] ) from a geometric and invariant point of view .",
    "hally s equations were deduced under the topological constraint that the sum of all vorticities is zero and , in fact , this is essential in recasting the equations in hamiltonian form .",
    "we also show , that , under this zero vorticity constraint , hally s equations on the sphere , coincide with bogolmonov s equations .",
    "let @xmath2 be a 2-dimensional riemannian manifold with metric tensor @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath2 is a symplectic manifold with symplectic form @xmath19 given by the area form induced by @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath20 be the hamiltonian function .",
    "equations @xcite are @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the hamiltonian vector field induced by @xmath23 .",
    "now we assume that @xmath2 is conformal to the plane , that is , that there are coordinates @xmath24 where the metric is given by @xmath25 for some function @xmath26 . in these",
    "coordinates the symplectic ( area ) form is given by @xmath27 introduce complex coordinates @xmath28 on the plane @xmath29 by @xmath30 using @xmath28 we obtain @xmath31 and @xmath32 hamilton s equations ( [ hamil ] ) become @xmath33 for convenience we think of @xmath34 as the new area form and @xmath35 as the new hamiltonian function . writing @xmath36",
    "the equations become @xmath37    we now show that hally s equations can be written as a hamiltonian system on the conformal plane .",
    "the equations are @xmath38 multiplying each term of the sum in the right hand side by @xmath39 and adding the zero @xmath40 to the right - hand side we obtain @xmath41 assuming that the sum of the vorticities is equal to zero we have @xmath42 that is    @xmath43    but those are hamilton s equations @xmath44 for the symplectic two - form @xmath45 and hamiltonian function @xmath46      denote by @xmath47 the two - dimensional sphere @xmath48 @xmath49 is a riemannian manifold with the metric induced by the euclidean metric in @xmath50 . introduce spherical coordinates on @xmath49 trough the relations @xmath51 with @xmath52 , @xmath53    consider the conformal map @xmath54 , @xmath55 where @xmath56 the conformal factor is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 now let @xmath59 .",
    "the euclidean distance @xmath60 in @xmath50 can be computed in the conformal variables .",
    "in fact @xmath61 that is @xmath62    now consider the map @xmath63 given by @xmath64 the pull back by @xmath65 of the symplectic form @xmath66 is just @xmath67 where by @xmath68 we denote the standard area form @xmath69 induced by the euclidean metric on @xmath70 .",
    "the pull back of the hamiltonian function    @xmath71 is    @xmath72    hamilton s equations for hamiltonian function ( [ hamm ] ) and symplectic form ( [ simp ] ) are precisely bogolmonov s equations for @xmath73 interacting vortices on a sphere .",
    "we notice that hally s equations are equivalent to bogolmonov s equations only for the case where all the vorticities sums up to zero .",
    "therefore , in dealing with the general vorticity case , one must use bogomolnov s equations .",
    "let @xmath74 represent the two dimensional ellipsoid of revolution @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 if @xmath78 the ellipsoid is prolate . in this case",
    "the eccentricity @xmath79 of the generating ellipse is given by @xmath80 .",
    "if @xmath81 the ellipsoid is oblate and the eccentricity of the generating ellipse is given by @xmath82 we observe that @xmath83 and therefore the truncated first order system is expected to approximate the real system for quite high values of the eccentricity .",
    "we introduce coordinates on @xmath84 trough the relations @xmath85 with @xmath52 , @xmath53 if @xmath86 the surface is a sphere of radius @xmath87 . in this case",
    "the projection @xmath88 is a conformal transformation .",
    "we want to find a conformal transformation from @xmath84 to the conformal plane when @xmath89 . by the symmetry of the ellipsoid",
    "the conformal factor must depend only on the radial variable @xmath90 and not on the angular variable @xmath91 we look for a transformation of the form @xmath92    we observe that when @xmath86 the inverse of the above transformation is just transformation ( [ stereo ] ) written in polar coordinates .",
    "the symmetry of the ellipsoid implies that the equator is a circle of radius @xmath87 . in the @xmath93 coordinates the equator has parametrization given by @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "therefore in the conformal coordinates @xmath96 the equator becomes the circle of radius @xmath97 we remark that the conformal factor for the ellipsoid , when restricted to the circle of radius @xmath98 is just the usual one for the sphere since the ellipsoid @xmath84 and the @xmath49 coincide at the equator .",
    "this is of utmost importance for what follows .",
    "in fact , since we will impose conformality at each order this trivial observation implies that @xmath99 for all @xmath3 .",
    "this is the condition that will guarantee the uniqueness of our series expansion .",
    "[ unique ] alternatively ( and equivalently ) , the uniqueness of the expansion can be obtained by imposing that the symmetry condition @xmath100 has to be satisfied at all orders .",
    "the algorithmic determination of the @xmath101 is obtained by imposing conformality at each order and follows the standard procedures of classical perturbation theory : truncate the series at order @xmath102 , find the conditions to be satisfied , and them assume those conditions to find the term of order @xmath103 . to find @xmath104 we impose that @xmath105 generates a conformal transformation up to first order in @xmath9 .    the line element for the ellipsoid",
    "is @xmath106 we want to write @xmath107 in terms of @xmath90 and @xmath108 .",
    "to this goal it suffices writing @xmath109 and @xmath110 in terms of @xmath90 .",

    "we observe that if @xmath86 then the transformation is conformal with conformal factor @xmath117 .",
    "for @xmath118 the only way this transformation can be conformal for all values of @xmath9 is if the coefficient of @xmath9 in the first square bracket is equal to the coefficient of @xmath9 in the second square bracket , that is if @xmath119 now by remark ( [ unique ] ) we must have @xmath120 what implies @xmath121 .",
    "finally we have @xmath122 transformation ( [ trans ] ) becomes @xmath123 the conformal factor is , to first order given by , @xmath124 that is @xmath125 we write @xmath126 where @xmath127    for future reference we observe that in terms of the variables @xmath128 and @xmath108 we obtain @xmath129    the above expansion can not be carried explicitly further .",

    "can not be computed using elementary functions .      using the conformal factor just found we will write the n - vortex equations on the ellipsoid of revolution up to first order terms in @xmath9 .",
    "we use the coordinates @xmath93 introduced trough equations ( [ coord11 ] ) .",
    "the symplectic two - form becomes @xmath133 observing that @xmath134 we define the vector field @xmath135 .",
    "@xmath136 satisfies hamilton s equations @xmath137 and the flow @xmath138 of the vector field @xmath139 is a time reparametrization of the flow @xmath140induced by @xmath141 .",

    "when @xmath15 the hamiltonian system given by ( [ hamn ] ) and ( [ simpn ] ) reduces to @xmath150 doing the following change of variables @xmath151 we obtain @xmath152 where @xmath153 @xmath154 equations ( [ mot2 ] ) are singular when @xmath155 i.e. @xmath156 . when @xmath86 equations ( [ mot2 ] ) reduces to a linear system and can be easily solved .",
    "those are the well known solutions for the two - vortex problem over the sphere : in a system of coordinates such that its z - axis is in the same direction as the center of vorticity @xmath157 the solutions are given in the @xmath158 , @xmath159 variables by @xmath160 where @xmath161 with @xmath108 a constant and @xmath162 with @xmath163 we observe that all solutions are periodic and the relative distance between the vortices is a first integral .    when @xmath164 the center of vorticity vector @xmath157 is not preserved .",
    "in fact , only it s @xmath165 component @xmath166 is preserved .",
    "this first integral implies , by dimensionality that system is integrable .",
    "since @xmath167 we obtain that @xmath168 are constants of motion . despite being integrable system ( [ mot2 ] ) seems not to admit explicit solutions for a general initial condition .",
    "their relative equilibria can be easily characterized in the cases @xmath169 .",
    "then we obtain that @xmath170 first we characterize the solutions such that @xmath171 is constant along the motion . since @xmath172 and since for@xmath173 either @xmath174 or @xmath175 it follows that @xmath176 and @xmath177 are constants for the relative equilibria .",
    "therefore @xmath178 @xmath179 implies that @xmath180 is a constant and therefore @xmath181 . from the equations it follows that @xmath182",
    "this implies that the only way ( [ ref1 ] ) can be zero is if @xmath183 we arrive at the result that in a relative equilibria @xmath176 , @xmath184 and @xmath180 are constants and that the vectors @xmath185 and @xmath186 are always in the same plane . the vectors @xmath157 and @xmath187 will precess around the @xmath165-axis with constant angular velocity and keeping their relative orientation .",
    "it follows from the definition that @xmath158 and @xmath159 will also precess around the @xmath165-axis with constant angular velocity and keeping their relative orientation .",
    "therefore the only solutions for which @xmath171 are constants are precisely the relative equilibria .",
    "case @xmath189 : if @xmath190 then @xmath191 and @xmath192 assuming that @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 we obtain that the angular velocity is given by @xmath197 we observe that the perturbation factor in the angular velocity is proportional to @xmath198 and therefore the deviation from the corresponding spherical relative equilibria should be bigger for smaller vorticities .",
    "we also observe that when @xmath86 then , taking as before @xmath199 : if @xmath200 then @xmath201 and @xmath202 proceeding as before we obtain @xmath203 the perturbation term is equal in both cases and again , as @xmath204 we will have @xmath205      the symmetry breaking when @xmath164 is expected to destroy the integrability of the three - vortices spherical problem .",
    "in fact , when @xmath206 the center of vorticity vector @xmath207 is conserved .",
    "the integrability follows by dimensionality . when @xmath118 , only it s z - component @xmath208 is conserved . that the integrability is destroyed is shown numerically in this section .",
    "we do not pursue a complete numerical study of the problem .",
    "this will addressed in a future work .    to calculate the poincar sections for the three - vortex problem we will introduce an appropriate coordinate system .",
    "first we introduce a cylindrical system of coordinates @xmath209 with @xmath210 and @xmath211 for @xmath212 .",
    "the transformation is defined trough @xmath213 since @xmath214 this is a symplectic transformation and the equations in cylindrical coordinates are given by @xmath215 to reduce the symmetry we define the coordinates @xmath216 it follows that @xmath217    therefore the new system of coordinates forms a canonical system .",
    "we observe that @xmath218 and therefore @xmath219 .",
    "then @xmath220 is a cyclic variable and the hamiltonian ( [ hamn ] ) is given by @xmath221 since this hamiltonian is now defined in a four dimensional phase - space , the poincar maps can be visualized .",

    "is kept smaller then @xmath222 . a constant step size equals to @xmath223 is used in all integrations .",
