    "flat - top solitary waves are coherent patterns , which exist as a result of a balance between dispersion / diffraction and competing nonlinearities , where the low order nonlinearity is `` focusing '' while the high order nonlinearity is `` defocusing '' @xcite . when the intensity of the field is relatively small , the low order nonlinearity is dominant , and consequently , the solitary waves are narrow and have a shape that is similar to that of conventional solitons . however , when the intensity increases , the high order nonlinearity becomes dominant and leads to the broadening of the pulse shape and to the generation of a typical table - top pattern .",
    "flat - top solitary waves appear as solutions to nonlinear wave models in many areas of physics , including nonlinear optics @xcite fluid dynamics @xcite , and plasma physics @xcite . as a result",
    ", they have been the subject of intensive research efforts in recent years .",
    "the interest in flat - top solitary waves is further enhanced since they are used in pattern formation theory to explain the emergence of fronts ( kinks ) from localized coherent structures such as solitons and solitary waves @xcite .",
    "many of the systems in which flat - top solitary waves appear can be influenced by processes involving noise or disorder .",
    "when the disorder is strong the solitary waves are usually destroyed , whereas , when it is weak , the solitary waves can form and evolve . in the latter case one is mainly concerned with the statistics of the solitary wave parameters .    in this study we focus attention on an important type of disorder , which we call multiplicative dissipative disorder .",
    "this type of disorder is characterized by the following properties : ( 1 ) the disorder affects the amplitude of the solitary wave in first order of the perturbation ; ( 2 ) the disorder term in the nonlinear wave model is multiplicative .",
    "dissipative disorder can appear in systems described by nonlinear wave equations in various forms .",
    "two of the most common forms are disorder in the linear gain / loss coefficient and disorder in the cubic nonlinear gain / loss coefficient .",
    "disorder in the linear gain coefficient can appear in optical fiber communication systems due to randomness in the gain of amplifiers that are positioned along the fiber line to compensate for the loss @xcite .",
    "moreover , such disorder appears in massive multichannel optical fiber transmission as a result of the interplay between raman - induced energy exchange in pulse collisions and bit pattern randomness @xcite . in this case",
    ", the disorder can lead to relatively high bit - error - rate values and intermittent dynamics of pulse parameters @xcite .",
    "we point out that in all the studies reported in refs . @xcite",
    "weak disorder was considered .",
    "in addition , both linear and cubic nonlinear disorder in the gain can emerge in an active nonlinear medium due to random variations with distance in the linear / nonlinear gain / loss coefficient .",
    "we consider two nonlinear wave models , which possess flat - top solitary wave solutions : the cubic - quintic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( cqnlse ) and the derivative cqnlse ( dcqnlse ) . a third model , the extended korteweg - de vries ( ekdv ) equation , is also briefly discussed .",
    "the cqnlse is a simple nonintegrable extension of the cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( cnlse ) possessing solitary wave solutions .",
    "the cqnlse describes a variety of physical systems including pulse propagation in semiconductor - doped optical fibers @xcite , laser - plasma interaction @xcite , and bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "another important reason for the interest in the cqnlse is that due to its nonintegrability it allows one to observe dynamical effects that do not exist in the cnlse , e.g. , emission of continuous radiation in two - soliton collisions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the cubic - quintic complex ginzburg - landau equation , which is a generalization of the cqnlse including dissipative terms , is known to describe even a wider range of physical systems , including , for example , convection and pattern formation in fluids @xcite and mode - locked lasers @xcite .",
    "the derivative cnlse is an extension of the cnlse that , in the context of nonlinear optics , takes into account the effects of self - steepening @xcite . for short optical pulses propagating in semiconductor - doped fibers both quintic nonlinearity and self - steepening are important .",
    "consequently , one expects that the derivative cqnlse , which takes into account both effects , would provide a more accurate description of the propagation in this case .",
    "we note that a variant of the derivative cnlse is known to describe propagation of alfvn waves in magnetized plasmas @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was recently shown theoretically and experimentally that a variant of the dcqnlse accurately describes propagation of high - intensity pulses in cascaded - quadratic nonlinear media @xcite .",
    "the ekdv equation , which is also known as the gardner equation , is an integrable model that describes interfacial waves in a two - layer system @xcite as well as stratified shear flow in the ocean @xcite .",
    "it provides a possible explanation to observations of large - amplitude flat - top solitary waves in coastal zones @xcite .    in a previous work",
    "@xcite we studied the effects of weak disorder in the linear gain coefficient on solitary waves of the cqnlse .",
    "we showed analytically ( by employing an adiabatic perturbation method ) and by monte carlo simulations that the probability density function ( pdf ) of the solitary wave amplitude has a loglognormal diverging form in the vicinity of the maximum possible amplitude .",
    "since solitary waves with amplitude values close to the maximum possible amplitude have a table - top shape , this finding means that the amplitude pdf of flat - top solitary waves exhibits loglognormal divergence .",
    "we also conjectured that similar loglognormal divergence should be observed for disorder in the nonlinear gain .",
    "however , the full analytic form of the amplitude pdf for disorder in the nonlinear gain was not obtained and the conjecture was not tested by numerical simulations .",
    "thus , the important question concerning the generality of the loglognormal divergence of the amplitude pdf for flat - top solitary waves was not fully answered , even for the cqnlse .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear whether loglognormal divergence can be observed in other nonlinear wave models possessing solitary wave solutions . in the current paper",
    "we address these questions in detail .",
    "we start by considering propagation of solitary waves of the cqnlse in the presence of weak disorder in the cubic nonlinear gain .",
    "the case of disorder in the cubic nonlinear gain is particularly important since cubic gain / loss is very common in many systems described by the complex ginzburg - landau equation ( see , for example , ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we calculate the amplitude pdf analytically by employing an adiabatic perturbation method and validate its loglognormal divergence by monte carlo simulations .",
    "we then turn to study propagation of solitary waves of the dcqnlse in the presence of weak disorder in the linear gain . in this case both the amplitude and the group velocity randomly vary during propagation .",
    "we therefore study the pdf of a new parameter , which is the ratio between the amplitude and a linear function of the group velocity .",
    "we find that the pdf of this new parameter is loglognormally divergent near the parameter s maximum value .",
    "we conclude by a brief discussion of the dynamic mechanism responsible for the loglognormal divergence of the pdfs , and of the possibility to observe similar statistical behavior in the ekdv model .",
