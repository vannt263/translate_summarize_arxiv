    "realistic nucleon - nucleon potentials contain strong tensor components .",
    "the tensor force induces the coupling of different orbital and spin angular momenta in the wave function of a few - nucleon system . because of this property a variational solution of the system faces complexities in describing the orbital motion .",
    "there are two widely used methods to expand the orbital part of the wave function .",
    "one is a hyperspherical harmonics ( hh ) expansion  @xcite , and the other is a successive coupling of partial waves for the relative motion of the particles  @xcite .",
    "a converged solution is attained by increasing the orbital angular momenta .    another representation for the orbital motion , proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , is to use a global vector ( gv ) which is defined by a linear combination of the relative coordinates .",
    "the coefficients of the combination determine the vector responsible for the rotation of the system .",
    "the spherical part of the orbital motion is expressed in terms of an explicitly correlated gaussian ( cg ) .",
    "the efficiency of the gv representation ( gvr ) has been tested in many examples  @xcite including not only nuclear but also atomic and hypernuclear physics problems .",
    "its accuracy was confirmed in ref .",
    "@xcite by comparing with the partial - wave expansion ( pwe ) for @xmath4h and @xmath0-particle interacting with central and tensor forces . in these studies",
    "only a single gv is used , and its application is thus restricted to natural parity states .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the gvr to describe the orbital motion with unnatural parity and to test the power of its representation .",
    "the unnatural parity state is usually unfavorable to gain the energies of low - lying levels , but it is needed to reach a precise energy particularly when the noncentral forces are taken into account .",
    "for example , the ground state of @xmath3he can be specified by three channels with @xmath5=(0,0 ) , ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are respectively the total orbital and spin angular momenta . here",
    "the channel with @xmath6=1 and positive parity is unnatural , and its mixing probability is of order only 0.37%  @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath6=1 unnatural component gives rise to a contribution of more than 1mev to the ground state energy .",
    "it is not a surprise that the interaction between composite particles like the nucleon becomes nonlocal  @xcite , and indeed there is now available a new class of nonlocal nucleon - nucleon interactions , e.g. , n@xmath4lo  @xcite and low-@xmath8  @xcite potentials .",
    "the nonlocal operator also appears when one needs to eliminate some redundant or pauli - forbidden states from the relative motion between composite particles  @xcite .",
    "thus we take a certain class of nonlocal operators into consideration in the present paper .",
    "a simple method of incorporating the unnatural parity state is to introduce two gvs .",
    "this was performed in the case of central forces and successfully applied to a search for excited states of a positronium molecule  @xcite . here",

    "<S> the angular motion of a few - body system is described with global vectors which depend on the positions of the particles . </S>",
    "<S> the previous study using a single global vector is extended to make it possible to describe both natural and unnatural parity states . </S>",
    "<S> numerical examples include three- and four - nucleon systems interacting via nucleon - nucleon potentials of av8 type and a 3@xmath0 system with a nonlocal @xmath1 potential . </S>",
    "<S> the results using the explicitly correlated gaussian basis with the global vectors are shown to be in good agreement with those of other methods </S>",
    "<S> . a unique role of the unnatural parity component , caused by the tensor force , is clarified in the @xmath2 state of @xmath3he . </S>",
    "<S> two - particle correlation function is calculated in the coordinate and momentum spaces to show different characteristics of the interactions employed . </S>"
