    "the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) has been designed to perform low - resolution , slitless spectroscopy over a wide range of wavelengths , from the ly@xmath1 line at @xmath2 = 1216   to @xmath3 1 @xmath4 m .",
    "one _ optical _ grism , one _ blue _ prism and two _ near - uv _ prisms cover this range and are coupled with the wide field ( wfc ) and high resolution ( hrc ) channels , the hrc and the solar blind channel ( sbc ) respectively .",
    "the wfc and the hrc make use of the same grism , g800l which works between @xmath3 5500   and @xmath3 1 @xmath4 m .",
    "its nominal dispersion is @xmath3 40  / pix and @xmath3 29  / pix in first order for the wfc and hrc respectively .",
    "the hrc also features a prism , pr200l , which covers the spectral range between @xmath3 2000   and 5000  , with a non linear dispersion varying from 2.6  / pix at @xmath2 = 1600   to 91  / pix at @xmath2 = 3500   and 515  / pix at @xmath2 = 5000  .    the sbc is equipped with two prisms , pr110l and pr130l which range from @xmath3 1150   and 1250   to 2000   with a resolving power of @xmath3 80 and @xmath3 100 , respectively , at @xmath2 = 1600  .",
    "in particular , pr130l does not include the geocoronal l@xmath1 line for low background measurements .",
    "pasquali et al .",
    "( 2001b ) showed that the high angular resolution of the acs may easily decrease the effective resolution of the grism , since , when no slit is used , the grism nominal resolution is convolved with the object size along the dispersion axis .",
    "the extension of any grism spectrum along the cross - dispersed direction is set by the size of the object which acts as an extraction aperture .",
    "this is also an additional source of degradation when the whole spectrum is summed along the cross - dispersion axis .",
    "the amplitude of these effects was investigated by simulating with slim 1.0 ( pirzkal et al .",
    "2001b ) the spectrum of the galactic planetary nebula ngc 7009 , and by increasing the linear size of the object as well as its orientation in the sky .",
    "the simulated grism spectra indicated that line blending becomes severe when objects are observed with a diameter larger than 2 pixels ( 0.1 ) and with a major axis at pa @xmath5 45@xmath6 with respect to the dispersion axis ( cf .",
    "pasquali et al .",
    "2001b ) .",
    "these limits pose strong constraints on the selection of targets for the in - orbit wavelength calibration of the acs spectral elements . indeed",
    ", such calibrators have to be sorted by :    1 .",
    "high brightness , to allow for short exposure times and time - series observations across the field of view ; 2 .   a large number of emission lines in their spectra ; 3 .",
    "the absence of an extended nebula , which would otherwise degrade the spectral resolution ; 4 .",
    "negligible spectro - photometric variability , to be able to identify emission lines at any observation epoch ; 5 .",
    "minimum field crowding , to avoid contamination by spectra of nearby stars ; 6 .",
    "visibility , to allow repeated hst visits .",
    "the above set of requirements rules out planetary nebulae ( pne ) as possible wavelength calibrators , at least in the case of the optical g800l grism .",
    "indeed , pne are resolved by hst up to the large magellanic clouds and hence do not meet requirement @xmath7 3 , while pne in m31 are compact enough but faint and therefore can not fulfil requirements @xmath7 1 , 6 and 5 as they also lie in crowded fields ( pasquali et al .",
    "2001a ) .",
    "wolf - rayet stars ( wrs ) of spectral type wc have been shown to satisfy all the requirements , at the expense of introducing a further constraint which concerns the velocity of their stellar wind",
    ". indeed , the wind velocity in wrs can be as slow as 700 km  s@xmath8 and as fast as 3300 km  s@xmath8 ( cf .",
    "van der hucht 2001 ) . a typical wind speed of 2000 km  s@xmath8 produces a line broadening of about 1.3 and 1.9 pixels in the grism first order with the wfc and the hrc , respectively .",
    "therefore , to limit the loss of resolution due to objects with broad emission lines , wr stars should be selected with v@xmath9 2000 km  s@xmath8 ( pasquali et al .",
    "we eventually selected two galactic wr stars from the vii@xmath10 catalogue by van der hucht ( 2001 ) which meet the listed criteria .",

    "wr  45 was observed as part of the servicing mission orbital verification ( smov ) tests ( i d 9029 , pi pasquali ) , at the end of april to early may 2002 .",
    "spectra were taken at five different pointings across the field of view ( f.o.v ) of the wfc : w1 close to the center of chip 2 , w3 and w5 close to amplifiers c and d of chip2 and w7 and w9 close to amplifiers a and b in chip 1 .",
    "these pointings are shown in figure 2 .    at each position ,",

    "the direct image , which provides the zero point of the grism dispersion correction , was taken in the f625w and f775w filters , in order to check the target position stability with wavelength .",
    "the adopted exposure times were 1 s for the direct imaging and 20 s for the grism .",
    "wr  96 was observed during the interim calibrations ( i d 9568 , pi pasquali ) in june 2002 .",
    "the observational strategy was similar to wr  45 , but the number of individual pointings was increased to 10 by adding to the smov positions the w2 , w4 , w8 , w10 pointings and the centre of chip 1 ( cf .",

    "monodimensional spectra of wr  45 and wr  96 were extracted from the raw , non drizzled images using the st - ecf slitless spectra extraction code , axe ( pirzkal et al .",
    "2001a , http://www.stecf.org/software/axe/index.html ) .",
    "the extraction of slitless spectra relies on a number of parameters :    1 .",
    "the shift in the x and y coordinates between the position of the target in the direct image and the position of the zeroth order in the grism image ; 2 .",
    "the tilt of spectra ; 3 .   the separation in pixels along the dispersion axis of the _ nth _ grism order from the zeroth ; 4 .",
    "the length in pixels along the dispersion axis of each grism order .",
    "while the shift allows a spectrum to be identified in the grism image given the coordinates of the target in the direct image , the tilt enables it to be traced . the separation and the length of the grism orders",
    "are used to set the extraction aperture for each order spectrum .",
    "because of the severe geometric distortions in the wfc , these quantities are expected to be field - dependent .      the x- and",
    "y - shifts could be measured for all the pointings , except w7 and w8 whose zeroth orders fall outside the physical boundaries of the grism image . the remaining are listed in table 2 in units of pixels ; they are the difference between the target position in the direct image and the zeroth order coordinate in the grism image .",

    "the tilt of the spectra was derived by fitting the ( x , y ) coordinates of the emission line peaks along the dispersion axis , measured from the negative third to the positive third order ( the negative orders at smaller x pixels than the zeroth order x coordinate , the positive ones at larger x pixels ) .",

    "the ntt / emmi template spectra of wr  45 and wr  96 were then convolved by these mean fwhms , their lines reidentified and the line wavelengths re - measured .",
    "the position in pixels of the same lines was measured in the acs grism spectra with respect to the target x position in the direct image and tables of pixels vs. wavelengths were built .",
    "each table was then fitted with the routine polyfit in iraf and a wavelength solution was determined for each grism order .",
    "this procedure was applied to each grism spectrum in all positions across the f.o.v of the wfc .",
    "in this proceeding we present the wavelength solutions ( and their field - dependence ) computed for the grism first , second and negative first orders which are the brightest . a field map of the dispersion correction for the grism third , negative second and negative third orders can be found in pasquali et al .",
