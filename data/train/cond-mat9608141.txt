    "measurements of josephson tunneling represent an important method of determining the symmetry of the superconducting state of high temperature superconductors@xcite .",
    "this article presents , in a pictorial fashion , symmetry arguments which give insight into precisely what is being measured experimentally in experiments performed on twinned crystals .",
    "( many experiments on yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( ybco ) have been carried out on twinned crystals@xcite .",
    "interesting studies of these twins can be found in@xcite ) .",
    "the important concept introduced here is that of a macroscopic symmetry group describing the symmetry properties of the superconducting state of the twinned crystal as a whole .",
    "this macroscopic symmetry group is what is determined by josephson experiments on highly twinned single crystals of ybco .",
    "the macroscopic symmetry group of the twinned crystal depends not only on the microscopic symmetry group of a single twin ( from which it differs ) but also on the symmetry of the twin boundaries .",
    "current experimental results indicate that the macroscopic symmetry group describing the superconducting state of twinned ybco is d@xmath4(d@xmath1)@xmath5i@xmath5r in the notation of@xcite ; this is the same symmetry group that describes @xmath6 superconductivity in a tetragonal superconductor .",
    "this result then leads to the conclusion that the twin boundaries in ybco have odd reflection symmetry ( and says nothing about whether the microscopic state of a single twin is predominantly s or d wave ) .",
    "similar conclusions were reached in @xcite by twin averaging the josephson currents ( but without introducing the idea of macroscopic symmetry ) .",
    "the macroscopic symmetry of a twinned sample for the case where the superconducting state of a twin breaks time - reversal symmetry is studied in@xcite .",
    "an interesting consequence of the odd symmetry of the twin boundaries in ybco is the predicted@xcite existence ( even in the absence of external magnetic fields ) of stable vortices carrying a flux of @xmath0 at the intersection of a twin boundary and an asymmetric 45@xmath7 grain boundary .",
    "this forms the basis for an explanation of the spontaneously generated magnetic flux observed by mannhart et al.@xcite and moler et al.@xcite in 45@xmath7 grain boundaries .",
    "this paper assumes that the superconductor ybco is orthorhombic and has a second order phase transition to its superconducting state .",
    "according to the ginzburg - landau theory of phase transitions there are therefore eight possible symmetries for the superconducting order parameter , one corresponding to each irreducible representation of the orthorhombic point group . the fact that josephson tunneling has been observed to occur along all three principal orthorhombic directions from ybco into an isotropic superconductor such as lead eliminates@xcite",
    "all of these possibilities except one , namely an order parameter of a@xmath8 ( or @xmath9 ) symmetry ( here @xmath10 and @xmath11 are arbitrary constants ) .",
    "since @xmath12 , where the constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be determined in terms of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the order parameter can also be viewed as being a linear combination of the tetragonal symmetry types @xmath15 ( i.e. d wave ) and @xmath16 ( i.e. s wave ) .    within the framework of a ginzburg - landau model for the twin boundary ,",
    "the superconducting state must be either even or odd with respect to a reflection in a twin boundary;@xcite which case actually occurs ( i.e. which has the lower free energy ) depends on the detailed microscopic structure and physics of the superconducting state at the twin boundary , about which this article makes no a priori assumptions .",
    "the two types of twin boundaries are illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "this figure shows two equivalent representations of the microscopic symmetry of the superconductivity in the two different types of twins . on the right of fig .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) the ellipses represent the orthorhombic @xmath17 symmetry ; the equivalent representation on the left shows the separate tetragonal @xmath15 ( the four - lobed objects ) and @xmath16 ( the circles ) components . notice that for the odd - symmetry twin boundary , all of the plusses and minuses change sign on a reflection in the twin boundary , whereas for the even - symmetry twin boundary , the superconducting state is invariant with respect to a reflection in the twin boundary .    in a twinned crystal",
    "there are two orientations of the twinning planes , namely the ( 110 ) and the @xmath18 twinning planes .",
    "2 shows regions of ( 110 ) and @xmath18 twinning planes and their interface , as observed in experiment.@xcite if the twin boundaries have odd symmetry , then the phase of the order parameter will be propagated in a particular way throughout the crystal by changing sign at each twin boundary , as is seen from fig .",
    "similarly , if the twin boundaries have even reflection symmetry , there is no change of sign of the order parameter at the twin boundaries , as is the case in fig .",
    "2(b ) .    a remarkable feature of fig .",
    "2 is that , even though the microscopic superconducting state of the individual twins is assumed to be the same in both cases , ( a ) and ( b ) have very different appearances as a result of the fact that the twin boundaries are different in the two cases . in fact ( a ) and ( b ) have different macroscopic symmetries . to determine the macroscopic symmetry ,",
    "the region of the crystal shown in ( a ) must be imagined to be part of a large crystal in which regions of ( 110 ) and @xmath18 twin boundaries are randomly distributed . now if the crystal of fig .",
    "2(a ) is rotated by 90@xmath7 about the @xmath19 axis ( i.e. an axis normal to the page ) , it will look the same except for a change of sign of all the plusses and minuses .",
    "this overall change of sign under a rotation of 90@xmath7 about the @xmath19 axis is one of the characteristics of @xmath6 superconductivity in a tetragonal superconductor .",
    "more detailed study shows that a twinned sample with odd - symmetry twin boundaries has exactly the same symmetry elements in its macroscopic symmetry group as does the ( microscopic ) symmetry group of a tetragonal @xmath6 superconductor ; this group is denoted@xcite by d@xmath4(d@xmath1)@xmath5i@xmath5r .",
    "similarly , the crystal of fig .",
    "2(b ) is invariant under a rotation of 90@xmath7 about the @xmath19 axis , and furthermore has precisely the same elements in its macroscopic symmetry group as are found in the ( microscopic ) symmetry group of a tetragonal s - wave superconductor ; this group is called@xcite d@xmath20i@xmath5r .",
    "there is substantial evidence from josephson experiments@xcite that the macroscopic symmetry of twinned ybco is that of a @xmath6 tetragonal superconductor .",
    "the appropriate conclusion to draw from this result is that the twin boundaries in ybco have odd reflection symmetry .",
    "the macroscopic symmetry group associated with various microscopic superconducting states which break time - reversal symmetry can also be determined .",
    "for example , the macroscopic symmetry group of the state described in @xcite is the same as that of a tetragonal @xmath21 superconductor .",
    "the main point of this section was to try to demonstrate pictorially and convincingly how the macroscopic symmetry of a twinned crystal is determined by the symmetry of the twin boundaries .",
    "3 shows what is called@xcite an asymmetric 45@xmath7 grain boundary in a ybco film .",
    "the crystal on the left consists of two twins , and the symmetries of the superconducting order parameters in the three regions of the figure are represented by ellipses , as described above .",
    "the grain boundary acts as a josephson junction with a free energy per unit area at point y ( y is distance measured along the grain boundary ) given by @xmath22,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the critical current density , and @xmath24 is the gauge invariant phase difference of the order parameter across the grain boundary .",
    "this is the usual expression except for @xmath25 , which is zero between 0 and q ( see fig .",
    "3 ) but is @xmath26 between p and 0 to take account of the change of sign at the twin boundary of the superconducting order parameter to the left of the grain boundary . to minimize this free energy , @xmath27 will be @xmath26 from p to 0 , will vary from @xmath26 to zero at the twin boundary ( changes in @xmath24 take place over a length @xmath28 , the josephson penetration depth ) and be zero in the region from 0 to q. variations in @xmath24 are associated with the presence of a magnetic field in the junction@xcite , and the variation of @xmath24 by @xmath26 at the twin boundary corresponds to a vortex there with flux @xmath0 .",
    "the stability of this @xmath0 vortex is a consequence of the odd reflection symmetry of the twin boundary .",
    "further details of the properties of asymmetric 45@xmath7 grain boundaries can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the relationship of the twin boundary symmetry to the macroscopic symmetry measured by josephson tunneling on an orthorhombically twinned superconductor such as ybco has been demonstrated pictorially .",
    "an interesting consequence of the odd - symmetry twin boundaries found in ybco is the existence of a @xmath0 vortex at the intersection of an isolated twin boundary and an asymmetric 45@xmath7 grain boundary .",
