    "in open quantum systems the loss , revival or maintenance of quantum correlations is deeply related to the structure of the external environment @xcite .",
    "the persistent interactions between system and environment and the appearance of memory effects were usually referred as non - markovianity .",
    "these conditions have been largely investigated and in the last years new definitions and measures of non - markovianity have been proposed .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "non - markovianity can be interpreted in terms of the flow of quantum information .",

    "@xcite estimates the relative distinguishability of two arbitrary quantum states . in markovian processes",
    "this measure diminishes monotonically in time .",
    "this behavior can be seen as a loss of quantum information by the open system , while in non - markovian dynamics the memory effects can be interpreted as a flow of quantum information from the external environment back into the open system . in this way , the structures of the environment that induce non - markovian dynamics can be found by studying the direction of the flow of quantum information @xcite .    the dephasing process of qubit ( two - level system ) that interacts with a structured reservoir of frequency modes @xcite is a referential scenario for the study of non - markovianity . in this system",
    "the measures of non - markovianity mentioned above suggest the same conditions for the appearance of non - markovian dynamics @xcite and are easily evaluated from the dephasing rate and the dephasing factor of the system @xcite .",
    "in fact , persistent negative values of the dephasing rate or , equivalently , a decreasing dephasing factor indicate back - flow of information into the open system and witness non - markovianity .    a remarkable analysis of the dependence of non - markovianity on the structure of the external environment is performed in ref .",
    "convexity properties that involve the general reservoir spectrum provide conditions for the appearance of non - markovian dynamics . for ohmic - like sds with exponential cutoff the transition from markovian to non - markovian dynamics appears in correspondence of a critical value of the ohmicity parameter . in fact , temporary back - flow of information and recoherence are found uniquely for values of the ohmicity parameters that are larger than such critical value . at zero temperature",

    "simulations of open system dynamics have been performed with trapped ions @xcite and transition from markovian to non - markovian dynamics has been obtained in an all - optical experiment @xcite , to name a few .    as a continuation of the scenario described above , here , we consider the local dephasing process of a qubit that interacts either with a structured reservoir of frequency modes or with a thermal bath .",
    "in addition to the ohmic - like structure , the sds under study include at low frequencies removable logarithmic singularities @xcite . at higher frequencies",
    "the sds are arbitrarily shaped .",
    "we study the decoherence and recoherence processes by evaluating the dephasing factor and we investigate the flow of quantum information by analyzing the dephasing rate , in dependence on the structure of the reservoir or of the thermal bath .",
