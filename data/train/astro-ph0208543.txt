    "both models were formulated using data from the 1998 outburst of sax  j1808.4@xmath03658 , but come to very different conclusions regarding the relationship between the power - law or comptonization component and the blackbody .",
    "@xcite assumed that the blackbody was the source of the seed photons ( i.e , @xmath96 ) and proposed that the comptonization component comes from the shock heated accretion column with soft photon input from the `` hot spot '' blackbody component .",
    "such a model implies that the blackbody and power - law / comptonization component fluxes should be correlated , which was the case for sax  j1808.4@xmath03658 but was not seen for xte  j0929@xmath0314 .    on the other hand",
    ", @xcite found that @xmath97 and suggested that the accretion disk provided the majority of the soft photon input to a spherical compton cloud , of radius @xmath98  km , from which the comptonization component originates .",
    "the @xcite model allows for the the blackbody and power - law / comptonization component to vary independently .",
    "@xcite also suggested that the low ( @xmath99 ) optical depth of the comptonizing region found for sax  j1808.4@xmath03658 allows for the pulsations of the ns to be detected , while the higher optical depths ( @xmath100 ) reported in more luminous lmxbs suppress the pulsation amplitudes .",
    "we find a best - fit @xmath101 for xte  j0929@xmath0314 , consistent with this explanation .",
    "however , we note that @xcite did not find an acceptable fit of the _ xmm _ spectra of the millisecond x - ray pulsar xte  j1751@xmath0305 using a comptonization model .",
    "while this model seems more appropriate for the spectral results of xte  j0929@xmath0314 , @xcite do not discuss what emission component is responsible for the pulsations .",
    "it is important to realize that both models are based on data with a low - energy bound of 2  kev , which is above the peak flux of the thermal components .",
    "the lower energy range of _ chandra _ allows us to make a more robust measurement of @xmath95 for xte",
    "j0929@xmath0314 than was possible for the _ rxte _ spectrum of sax  j1808.4@xmath03658 .",
    "we conclude that neither model is completely appropriate to explain both our results .",
    "more observations of these sources throughout outburst are necessary in order to fully understand their phase - averaged spectral properties .",
    "we suggest that in - depth data analysis , including pulse - phase spectroscopy , will provide more insight into the relationship between the various spectral components .",
    "the pulse - phase resolved spectral analysis of xte  j0929@xmath0314 will be presented in a later paper .",
    "we find that the best - fit photon index was significantly different between the _ chandra _ and _ rxte _ fits with @xmath102 for the _ chandra _ fits , dependent on the assumed instrumental c abundance , and @xmath103 for the _ rxte _ fits .",
    "since fits with and without the pileup model give consistent parameter values , we reject the possibility that pileup causes the lower _ chandra _ photon index .",
    "the combined _ chandra _ and _",
    "rxte _ spectrum of xte  j0929@xmath0314 is well fit by either a comptonization @xmath1 blackbody model ( which implicitly includes a low - energy turnover from the comptonization component ) , or a broken power - law @xmath1 blackbody model , with break energy 1.44.4  kev .",
    "the high - energy ( @xmath104  kev ) _ chandra _ spectrum is consistent with the _ rxte _ spectral results , indicating that instrumental differences alone do not give rise to the spectral turnover .",
    "based on these results , we suggest that the difference in best - fit photon indices between _ chandra _ and _ rxte _ arises from spectral turnover at low energies .",
    "while a power - law model is a reasonable approximation to comptonization at high energies , extrapolating the power law to low energies leads to a predicted flux that diverges at zero energy .",
    "therefore , the power - law must turnover at some energy for the integrated to flux to be finite .",
    "in addition , the difference in the photon index between the _ chandra _ and _ rxte _ spectral fits is similar to that noted by @xcite between the _ rxte _ and _ xmm _ spectral fits of xte j1751@xmath0305 . from their _ xmm",

    "rxte_. we interpret the difference between the _ xmm _ and _ rxte _ spectral results for xte j1751@xmath0305 as evidence of low energy turnover in the broadband spectrum of that source , providing independent support that the turnover is astrophysical in origin ."
