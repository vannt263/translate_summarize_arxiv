    "control theory is a set of techniques for making a dynamical system behave in a desired way exerting a minimum effort . in particular , this technique may be applied to chaotic systems in order to make them follow a desired periodic orbit  @xcite or to synchronize a `` slave '' replica with a `` master '' one  @xcite .",
    "most of the literature about control theory deals with low - dimensional systems modeled by a few differential equations . in such systems",
    ", the number of expanding directions is small and they behave smoothly in tangent space .    in this paper",
    "we want to introduce the problem of controlling _ extended , highly non - linear _ dynamical systems .",
    "there is a class of systems , termed _ stable chaotic _",
    "@xcite which are nor chaotic in the usual sense of the sensitive dependence with respect to infinitesimal perturbations , but are nonetheless unpredictable . in particular , we shall concentrate on cellular automata ( ca ) , which are discrete , deterministic dynamical systems .",
    "ca are widely used to model many systems in various fields , from computer science to earth sciences , biology , physics , sociology , etc .",
    "they are usually defined on a graph or a regular lattice , but may easily be extended to include mobile agents .",
    "the modeling of a system using cellular automata is conceptually much simpler than those using partial derivatives , and the evolution of such a system is easily performed by a digital computer , without rounding errors .",
    "however , for such systems continuity and smoothness ( differentiability ) do not apply .",
    "it is therefore hard to extend the usual techniques used in control thory and to define quantities like lyapunov exponents and chaotic trajectories .    in the case of master - slave synchronization , the `` minimal strength '' needed to synchronize",
    "a system is related to its chaoticity , defined by the lagest lyapunov exponent in low - dimensional systems . for extended systems , the correspondence between the minimal strength and lyapunov exponents may break down  @xcite .",
    "it is still possible to define derivatives of discrete systems  @xcite , which prove useful in synchronization investigations  @xcite .    in synchronization experiments ,",
    "the `` force '' is generally applied blindly , without any relation with the dynamics .",
    "the corresponding synchronization effect is analogous to a directed percolation phase transition .",
    "the two systems synchronize when their difference goes to zero .",
    "their difference grows due to their `` chaotic '' dynamics , along the directions identified by the jacobian matrix of the evolution rule .",
    "the synchronization `` pressure '' reduces the paths along which a difference can propagate . when this reduction overcomes the chaotic growth , the system synchronizes .    in control problems ,",
    "one wants to exploit the knowledge about a system .",
    "it is therefore analogous to a synchronization problem of two different systems with a `` targeted '' force , that tries to `` kill '' the growing directions of the difference as soon as possible .",
    "we show how the concept of boolean derivative and that of boolean jacobian matrix can be used to achieve this goal .    this technique may be used also as a measurement technique : one system may be the experimental one , and the replica may be simulated on a computer . in this case , the two systems are in general different .",
    "we apply the control technique in order to synchronize two different cellular automata rules , one of which may be stochastic ( i.e. , influenced by external noise ) .",
    "let us start our presentation by considering two smooth , chaotic maps @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the control `` strength '' , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are two maps , @xmath4 is valued at the discrete time @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is valued at @xmath7 ( the same applies to @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "the @xmath4 is the `` master '' , the @xmath8 the `` slave '' . the separation between both maps is @xmath10 and the goal of control is to keep @xmath11 below a certain threshold ( which may be zero ) , using the minimum strength @xmath1 .",
    "the two maps @xmath2 and @xmath3 may be different ( for instance , they may use different parameters ) or the same , in this case ( synchronization ) the synchronized state @xmath12 is absorbing .",
    "if the desired trajectory is a natural one for the slave , control is equivalent to master - slave synchronization . @xmath13 and @xmath14 for smooth maps , near the synchronization threshold @xmath15 , it is possible to expand @xmath16 around the unperturbed trajectory @xmath17 , @xmath18 by iterating this map , one obtains the relation between synchronization threshold @xmath15 and lyapunov exponent @xmath19 , @xmath20 the synchronized state is absorbing , since if for some time @xmath21",
    ", then the control can be relaxed and the trajectories stay synchronized . however , for chaotic systems , this state is unstable .",
    "natural systems , however , are rarely low - dimensional",
    ". we can extend the previous analysis by considering a lattice of coupled maps , that may be thought as a stroboscopic view of a continuous system : @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "the function @xmath3 represents the spatial coupling , it can be diffusive ( linear ) or highly nonlinear .",
    "the function @xmath2 is the individual map , and can lead , when uncoupled , either to fixed points , stable cycles or chaotic oscillations .",
    "a perturbation may amplify exponentially in time by the action of @xmath2 , but only linearly in time through the coupling ( propagation to neighboring sites ) .",
    "the dynamical properties of an extended system are generally analyzed by means of the lyapunov spectrum . using vector notation , eq .",
    "( [ extended ] ) can be written as @xmath24 the components of the jacobian matrix of @xmath25 are @xmath26 @xmath27 . for an infinitesimal perturbation @xmath28 for instance , the jacobian matrix of one - dimensional systems with nearest neighbor couplings has zero values except on the three central diagonals as @xmath29",
    "the eigenvectors of the jacobian define the instantaneous _ tangent space _ of a dynamical system .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath30 of the time product @xmath31 of the jacobian matrices over a trajectory define the lyapunov spectrum @xmath32 with @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "it is generally assumed that a system is chaotic if @xmath34 and stable if @xmath35 .",
    "the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath36 ( lle ) does not capture all the chaotic characteristics of an extended system .",
    "in general , a weak diffusive coupling reduces the lle ( since diffusion limits the exponential expansion along tangent space ) .",
    "therefore , for small couplings , the maximum of chaoticity corresponds to _ uncoupled _ maps , but this situation may correspond to the easiest synchronizability ( see section  [ sec : synchro ] ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      preliminary simulation results are presented in figure  [ fig : control ] . as expected , for linear rules",
    "there is no influence of the type of control , since all configurations have the same number of derivatives . for nonlinear rules ,",
    "the observed behavior is the opposite of what is expected for continuous systems .",
    "control 2 , that minimizes the distance @xmath37 for vanishing number of damages according to eq .",
    "( [ ulin ] ) , gives worse results than the blind control 1 .",
    "control 3 , inversely proportional to the sum of first - order derivatives , gives better results than the blind control 1 .",
    "this result holds also for larger neighborhoods ( figure  [ fig : control]-c ) , but not for all rules .",
    "this surprising effect may be due to the fact that defects self - annihilate , as shown in figure  [ selfannihilation ] .",
    "in other words , we can exploit the characteristics of cellular automata ( and other stable chaotic systems ) in order to achieve a better control by exploiting the local contraction of the evolution rule .",
    "spatially extended stable systems ( namely cellular automata ) may exhibit unpredictable behavior ( finite - distance chaoticity ) .",
    "the pinching synchronization threshold is related to this chaoticity . on the other hand , boolean derivatives and discrete lyapunov exponents",
    "may be used to characterize this kind of chaos .",
    "synchronization may also be exploited for control in experimental situations . in the control problem one",
    "aims at discovering a protocol that keeps the distance @xmath37 below a certain threshold with the minimum `` effort '' , given some constraints .",
    "we have chosen to investigate the behavior of two control schemes based on the local number of non - zero first - order derivatives , taking as reference the `` blind '' pinching synchronization protocol .",
    "we have shown that , differently from usual chaotic systems , one can exploit _ self - annihilation _ of defects to obtain synchronization with a weaker control , corresponding to the case in which the control is inversely proportional to the number of non - zero derivatives .",
