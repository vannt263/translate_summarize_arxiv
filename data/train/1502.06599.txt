    "based on the full - mission _ planck _",
    "observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , _ planck_-2015 results show that the temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard spatially - flat six - parameter @xmath5cdm cosmology with a primordial power - law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations .",
    "hereafter we shall call this model the base-@xmath5cdm . on the other hand , the same data , especially the temperature - temperature ( tt ) spectrum reveals some tension with the cmb lensing deflection angle ( @xmath6 ) spectrum reconstructed from the same maps . in details , the lensing amplitude in cmb temperature and polarization spectra , @xmath7 , is in @xmath1 tension with the amplitude of the cmb trispectrum reconstructed lensing deflection angle spectrum , @xmath8 while it is expected that in the base-@xmath5cdm model both these quantities should be equal to unity .",
    "the _ planck _ collaboration finds that , compared with the base-@xmath5cdm model , the base-@xmath5cdm+@xmath3 model can reduce the logarithmic likelihood ( @xmath9 ) and provide a better fit to the data sets with @xmath10 or marginalized constraint @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "more importantly , they find that there is roughly equal preference for high @xmath3 from intermediate and high multipoles ( _ i.e. _ , the ` plik ` likelihood ; @xmath11 ) and from the low-@xmath12 likelihood ( @xmath13 ) with a further small change coming from the priors .",
    "this means that the base-@xmath5cdm+@xmath3 model can provide a better fit than base-@xmath5cdm model against both tt and lowp data sets .",
    "however , the increase in @xmath3 will induce changes on the full sets of cosmological parameters as mentioned in the reference  @xcite .",
    "for example , compared with the base-@xmath5cdm fit , the scalar index , @xmath14 , is increased by @xmath15 , the primordial scalar spectrum amplitude , @xmath16 , is reduced by @xmath17 and the effective amplitude of the tt spectrum , @xmath18 , is reduced by @xmath15 . through",
    "the complicated relationship between parameters and their degeneracy the re - ionization optical depth parameter , @xmath19 , falls to @xmath20 , which is roughly in @xmath1 tension with _",
    "planck_-2013 temperature + wmap low-@xmath12 polarization data results of @xmath21 .",
    "inspired by these observations , in this paper , we investigate whether some modifications of gravity can relieve the tension between _ planck _ cmb anisotropy spectra and cmb lensing results .",
    "to do so we will simulate a tension cmb data set that resembles the tension present in the _",
    "planck_-2015 results and we will try to fit the resulting power spectra with different models to have a glimpse of the changes in the parameter that arise because of this tension .    we shall show that the modified gravity models that we consider are not capable of alleviating this kind of tension without affecting substantially the growth of structure .",
    "these models will then have problems in fitting simultaneously other cosmological probes .",
    "moreover we will show that , if the amplitude of the reconstructed cmb lensing power spectrum is in tension with the amount of cmb lensing in the anisotropy spectra , these kind of models struggle to relieve it . as we will elaborate later",
    "this happens because modified gravity models predict the same amplitude for the reconstructed cmb lensing potential and the lensing effect on the cmb so that the tension is usually moved to other parameters of the model .",
    "we analyse several modified gravity models against two sets of simulations of cmb spectra ( tt , te , ee ) and cmb lensing spectra ( dd and td ) with the fiducial cosmological parameter equal to the _ planck_-2015 data release best - fit values and _ planck _ blue book beam and noise specifications . the motivation of doing these simulations are mainly two .",
    "first of all the _ planck_-2015 likelihood code and the corresponding spectrum data are not yet publicly available .",
    "second , because the cosmological parameters are degenerate with each other in a complicated way , by using simulations , we can efficiently isolate and study the effects coming from different parameters and their combinations .    in the following section",
    ", we will briefly review the futurcmb package  @xcite that we used to produce our simulations .",
    "the construction of the power spectrum simulations are mainly made by two essential parts , firstly the mock data generation and the likelihood construction .",
    "for the mock data generation we assume , for simplicity , the raw maps to be composed of gaussian signal ( @xmath22 ) and a uniform gaussian white noise ( @xmath23 ) , @xmath24 where the superscript @xmath25 stands for temperature and e - mode polarization as we do not consider b - mode polarization . the observation phase",
    "then convolves this signal with a gaussian beam characterized by the full width half maximum parameter @xmath26 . on the top of it , we also need to add a gaussian white noise .",
    "up to a normalization , the noise power spectrum can be approximated as @xmath27\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 models the root mean square of the instrumental noise . in this paper",
    ", we shall adopt the _ planck _",
    "bluebook  @xcite beam and noise parameters .",
    "the exact values used in our simulations are listed in table  [ tab : experiment ] .",
    "the mock data generator package futurcmb automatically computes the noise power spectra of the lensing deflection angle based on the hu - okamoto  @xcite quadratic estimator algorithms from the given temperature and polarization spectra and noises .",
    "then , we feed the fiducial cosmological model into futurcmb . in this paper , we generate the fiducial spectra @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 as well as @xmath33 from the public boltzmann code camb  @xcite . in order to mimic _",
    "planck_-2015 results , the cosmological parameter used to produce the fiducial spectra are set to the best - fit values of the base-@xmath5cdm+@xmath3 model to the tt+lowp and tt+lowp+lensing data set of the _ planck_-2015 data release ( see table  [ tab : fiducialcp ] ) . with these input",
    "the futurcmb code will generate gaussian - distributed random fields for @xmath34 and estimate the corresponding spectra @xmath35 .",
    "for further details about the numerical implementation of the futurcmb code we refer the reader to  @xcite .",
    "the second step is to construct the likelihood for the mock data sets . since it is generated from a gaussian realization , we can write the likelihood function of the data given the theoretical template as  @xcite @xmath36\\bf a\\right)\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the data vector , @xmath38 is the parameter vector , and @xmath39 is the theoretical data covariance matrix . for the detailed construction of the spectrum likelihood",
    "we refer to  @xcite .",
    "first of all we check whether these models can reproduce the input amplitude of lensing .",
    "to do so we define an effective lensing amplitude as @xmath40 and we plot it for several choices of the parameters defining our modified gravity models in figure  [ fig : aleff ] . from both panels we can see that the effective lensing amplitude is generally a function of scale so that the accuracy of using a scale independent approximation for it is limited by the accuracy of observations .",
    "that is , if observations are not precise enough then the scale independent approximation can work while if the observations have enough sensitivity we would bias parameter estimation by considering it scale independent .",
    "this point will be more and more relevant as the experimental accuracy improves .",
    "the @xmath41 case , shown in panel ( a ) , in particular , displays an @xmath42 that is monotonically increasing as a function of scale . at low multipoles",
    "the agreement with a scale independent model is as good as few percent while in the high-@xmath12 range it is off by @xmath43 depending on the present value of the compton wavelength of the scalaron .",
    "+ the constant @xmath44 and @xmath45 models are shown in panel ( b ) .",
    "unlike the @xmath41 case , @xmath46 has a wide bump or dip around multipoles of few tenths while the scale dependence is somewhat weaker than the previous case .",
    "as expected , in the @xmath47 model the amplitude of lensing is decreased as a consequence of the suppression of growth while the opposite behaviour shows when @xmath48 is smaller than zero .",
    "we fit these models to our mock - a and mock - c data sets and we show the marginalized bound on parameters of interest in figure  [ fig : mg ] . from panel",
    "( a ) we can see that there is a strong positive correlation between the scalaron present compton wavelength parameter @xmath49 and @xmath4 .",
    "this effect is well known and corresponds to the fact that as the effective newton constant is increased the growth of matter perturbations is increased as well .",
    "when considering just mock - a our results show that in order to mimic @xmath50 , the marginalized constraint on @xmath49 have to point significantly toward large values of the scalaron compton wavelength .",
    "the marginal bound is then @xmath51 at @xmath52 c.l ..    due to the significant degeneracy between @xmath49 and @xmath4 such values of @xmath49 will lead to strong enhancement of the growth rate at relatively small scales making the @xmath4 value too large so that the tension between _ planck _ and and lss surveys , such as cfhtlens  @xcite , would become even worse . for this reason when lensing is added in mock - c , the tension in @xmath3 , that for the lensing data set is smaller , pushes the posterior of @xmath49 toward smaller values , making it closer to gr . a similar effect",
    "was also observed for the _",
    "planck_-2015 data set  @xcite and in the _",
    "planck_-2013 data  @xcite .",
    "as expected a similar result is found also in the @xmath45 model , as shown in panel ( b ) . here",
    "the correlation between @xmath48 is negative due to the fact that negative values of @xmath53 correspond to significant deviations from gr , and consequently to stronger enhancement of cmb lensing .",
    "all the conclusions , previously discussed in the @xmath41 case , apply also to this model with the relevant exception that the enhancement of the growth is not so dramatic as in @xmath41 .",
    "the bound on @xmath4 from the @xmath3 fit , shown in figure  [ fig : mg ] as a gray band , is in fact almost compatible with the one in the @xmath45 case .",
    "this is due to the fact that deviations from scale independence of @xmath54 , in this model , are weaker and a constant @xmath53 is more efficient at mimicking a scale independent @xmath3 than @xmath41 models . since a weaker effective newton constant",
    "is disfavoured by the _",
    "planck_-2015 cmb anisotropy data , the best - fit parameter in the @xmath47 model mimic those in the base-@xmath5cdm model and the model result to be compatible with gr .",
    "this conclusion is similar to the one found in  @xcite .    at last in table  [ tab : chisq ]",
    "we list the best - fit @xmath55 for the one parameter extensions of the base-@xmath5cdm model that we investigated in this paper .",
    "from there we can see that the best - fit @xmath55 values in the base-@xmath5cdm+@xmath3 , @xmath41 , @xmath45 models are similar and are noticeably smaller than those from base-@xmath5cdm or @xmath47 models with @xmath56 from the mock - a and @xmath57 from the mock - c data sets .",
    "the best - fit @xmath55 in the @xmath45 case is slightly better than the @xmath41 case and closer to the @xmath3 one because of the weaker scale dependence of @xmath42 .",
    "+ in conclusion , _",
    "planck_-2015 results revealed some interesting tensions between cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies and cmb lensing .",
    "these tensions add to the one reported by lss surveys , like cfhtlens , that seem to favour a smaller @xmath4 .",
    "if this is not due to some unaccounted systematic effects , this might be an indication of exotic physics beyond the base-@xmath5cdm model and as such should be investigated in great detail .",
    "+ in this paper , using a simulation of the _",
    "planck_-2015 data set , we tried to reconcile this tension with some modified gravity models .",
    "in particular we studied whether this tension can be mitigated by @xmath41 models or models characterized by a constant conformal coupling between gravitational and matter perturbations .",
    "we found that the @xmath41 and the @xmath45 models can mimic the role of @xmath3 even if , generally , the amplitude of lensing , with respect to the gr case , is scale dependent . in order to provide a good fit to the _",
    "planck_-like cmb anisotropy spectra , however , these models predict an enhancement of the growth on smaller scales that make the tension in @xmath4 even worse . from these results",
    "we can conclude that the tension between the growth of matter perturbations assessed from cmb power spectra , cmb lensing and lss surveys can be mimicked by modified gravity models but is hardly relieved by simple models beyond the standard @xmath5cdm one .",
    "this in turn suggests to investigate more complicated models , possibly with different time dependencies , to allow for different regimes of growth at the times at which each of these observations is more sensitive .",
