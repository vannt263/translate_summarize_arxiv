    "there is accumulating evidence that the exotic behavior exhibited by several metallic , magnetic and superconducting materials may have its origin in underlying large quantum fluctuations and proximity to a quantum phase transition . for this reason ,",
    "much efforts are currently being devoted to understand quantum phase transitions in a wide variety of condensed matter systems .",
    "perhaps the simplest model that embodies the phenomenon of a quantum phase transition is the transverse field ising model ( tfim )  @xcite , first proposed by de gennes to describe proton tunneling in ferrolectric materials  @xcite .",
    "the spin hamiltonian for the tfim reads : @xmath16 the @xmath17 ( @xmath12 ) quantum spin operators reside on the lattice sites @xmath18 of some @xmath19dimensional lattice .",

    "@xmath32 is the effective transverse field along the @xmath27 direction , perpendicular to the ising @xmath29 axis .",
    "as described below , the effective transverse field @xmath32 does not correspond one - to - one to the applied physical field @xmath3 .",

    "one noteworthy effect at play in lhyf at low temperatures is the significant enhancement of the zero temperature critical @xmath3 , @xmath61 , caused by the strong hyperfine nuclear interactions in ho@xmath4-based materials  @xcite .",
    "liho@xmath0y@xmath1f@xmath2 in a transverse @xmath3 and @xmath62 has long been known to display paradoxical behaviors , both in the ferromagnetic ( fm ) ( @xmath63 ) and spin glass ( sg ) ( @xmath64 ) regimes . in the fm regime ,",

    "however , @xmath73 becomes less singular as @xmath74 is increased from @xmath75 , suggesting that no quantum phase transition between a pm and a sg state exists as .",
    "recent theoretical studies  @xcite suggest that for dipole - coupled ho@xmath4 in a diluted sample , nonzero @xmath74 generates longitudinal ( along the ising @xmath76 direction ) random fields that ( i ) lead to a faster decrease of @xmath77 in the fm regime  @xcite and ( ii ) destroy the pm to sg transition for samples that otherwise show a sg transition when @xmath66 @xcite , or , at least , lead to a disappearance of the @xmath71 divergence as @xmath3 is increased from zero  @xcite .",
    "perhaps most interesting among the phenomena exhibited by lhyf is the one referred to as _",
    "antiglass _ and which has been predominantly investigated in liho@xmath78y@xmath79f@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the reason for this name comes from ac susceptibility data on liho@xmath78y@xmath79f@xmath53 which show that the distribution of relaxation times _ narrows _ upon cooling below 300 mk  @xcite .",
    "this behavior is quite different from that observed in conventional spin glasses where the distribution of relaxation times broadens upon approaching a spin glass transition at @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "the antiglass behavior has been interpreted as evidence that the spin glass transition in liho@xmath15y@xmath1f@xmath2 disappears at some nonzero @xmath81 .",
    "results from more recent experimental studies on liho@xmath82y@xmath83f@xmath2 ( @xmath84 16.5% ) and liho@xmath78y@xmath79f@xmath53 ( @xmath84 4.5% ) suggest an absence of a genuine spin glass transition , even for a concentration of ho as large as 16.5%  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is in stark contrast with theoretical arguments  @xcite which predict that , because of the long - ranged @xmath85 nature of dipolar interactions , classical dipolar ising spin glasses should have @xmath86 for all @xmath87 .",
    "however , even more recent work asserts that there is indeed a thermodynamic sg transition for @xmath88  @xcite , but that the behavior found in liho@xmath78y@xmath79f@xmath2 is truly unconventional  @xcite .",
    "two very different scenarios for the failure of liho@xmath78y@xmath79f@xmath53 to show a spin glass transition have been put forward  @xcite .",
    "firstly , it has been suggested that the ( small ) off - diagonal part of the dipolar interactions lead to virtual crystal field excitations that admix @xmath89 with @xmath90 and give rise to non - magnetic singlets for spatially close pairs of ho@xmath4 ions .",
    "the formation of these singlets would thwart the development of a spin glass state .",
    "this mechanism is analogous to the one leading to the formation of the random singlet state in dilute antiferromagnetically coupled @xmath12 heisenberg spins  @xcite .",
    "however , a recent study  @xcite shows that the energy scale for this singlet formation is very low ( @xmath91 mk ) and that the random singlet mechanism  @xcite may not be very effective at destroying the spin glass state in liho@xmath78y@xmath79f@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "hence the proposed formation of an entangled state in liho@xmath78y@xmath79f@xmath2 may , if it really exist , perhaps proceed via a more complex scheme than that proposed in ref .",
    "[ ] . also , the low - temperature features observed in the specific heat in ref .  [ ] have not been observed in a more recent study  @xcite .",
    "secondly , and from a completely different perspective , numerical simulations of _ classical _ ising dipoles found that the spin glass transition temperature , @xmath51 appears to vanish for a concentration of dipoles below approximately 20% of the sites occupied  @xcite . however , even more recent monte carlo simulations find that this conclusion may not be that firmly established  @xcite .    as another possible and yet unexplored scenario ,",
    "we note here that since ho@xmath4 is an even electron system ( i.e. a non - kramers ion ) , the kramers theorem is inoperative and the ground state doublet can be split by random ( electrostatic ) crystal field effects that compete with the collective spin glass behavior .",
    "for example , random strains , which may come from the substitution of ho@xmath4@xmath92y@xmath4 , break the local tetragonal symmetry and introduces ( random ) crystal fields operators ( e.g. @xmath93 ) which have nonzero matrix elements between the two states @xmath94 with @xmath95 of the ground doublet , splitting it , and possibly destroying the spin glass phase at low ho@xmath4 concentration .",
    "indeed , such random transverse fields have been identified in samples with very dilute ho@xmath4 in a liyf@xmath2 matrix  @xcite .",
    "also , very weak random strains , hence effective random transverse fields , arise from the different ( random ) anharmonic zero point motion of @xmath96li and @xmath97li in ho : liyf@xmath2 samples with natural abundance of @xmath96li and @xmath97li  @xcite .",
    "finally , there may be intrinsic strains in the crystalline samples that do not arise from the ho@xmath4/y@xmath4 or @xmath96li/@xmath97li admisture  @xcite .",
    "however , using available estimates  @xcite , calculations suggests that strain - induced random fields at play in liho@xmath78y@xmath79f@xmath53 may be too small [ @xmath98 to cause the destruction of the spin glass phase in this system  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the point remains that , in principle , the non - kramers nature of ho@xmath4 does offer a route for the destruction of the spin glass phase in liho@xmath0y@xmath1f@xmath2 outside strictly pairwise , quantum  @xcite or classical  @xcite , magnetic interaction mechanisms . at this stage , this is clearly a matter that needs to be investigated experimentally further .",
    "one notes that , because of kramers theorem , the destruction of a sg phase via strain - induced effective random transverse fields would not occur for an odd - electron ( kramers ) ion such as dy@xmath4 or er@xmath4 . in that context",
    ", one might think that a comparison of the behavior of lidy@xmath15y@xmath1f@xmath53 or lier@xmath15y@xmath1f@xmath53 with that of liho@xmath15y@xmath1f@xmath53 would be interesting .",
    "unfortunately , while liho@xmath15y@xmath1f@xmath53 is an ising system , the er@xmath4 and dy@xmath4 moments in lier@xmath15y@xmath1f@xmath53 and lidy@xmath15y@xmath1f@xmath53 are xy - like  @xcite .",
    "hence , one can not compare the lier@xmath15y@xmath1f@xmath53 and lidy@xmath15y@xmath1f@xmath53 xy compounds with the liho@xmath15y@xmath1f@xmath53 ising material on the same footing .    from the above discussion",
    ", it is clear that there are a number of fundamental questions raised by experimental studies of liho@xmath0y@xmath1f@xmath2 , both in zero and nonzero transverse field @xmath3 , that warrant systematic experimental investigations in other similar diamagnetically - diluted dipolar ising - like magnetic materials .",
    "specific questions are :    1 .",
    "how does the quantum criticality of a transverse field ising material with much smaller hyperfine interactions than ho@xmath4 in liho@xmath0y@xmath1f@xmath2 manifest itself  @xcite ?",
    "2 .   is the theoretical proposal of transverse - induced random longitudinal fields in diluted dipolar ising materials  @xcite valid and can it be explored and confirmed in other materials other than liho@xmath0y@xmath1f@xmath2 @xcite ? in particular , are the phenomena observed in ref .  [ ] and ascribed to griffiths singularities observed in other disordered dipolar ising systems subject to a transverse field ? 3 .",
    "does the antiglass phenomenon  @xcite occur in other diluted dipolar ising materials ? if yes , which , if any , of the aforementioned theoretical proposals for the destruction of the spin glass state at small spin concentration is correct ?",
    "as mentioned above , these questions can not be investigated with the lier@xmath15y@xmath1f@xmath53 and lidy@xmath15y@xmath1f@xmath53 materials isotructural to the liho@xmath0y@xmath1f@xmath2 ising compound since they are xy - like systems .",
    "however , we note in passing that it would nevertheless be interesting to explore the topic of induced random fields  @xcite and the possible existence of an xy dipolar spin glass and/or antiglass state in lier@xmath15y@xmath1f@xmath53 and lidy@xmath15y@xmath1f@xmath53 .",
    "the litb@xmath15y@xmath1f@xmath53 material is of limited use in such investigations since the single ion ground state of tb@xmath4 in this compound consists of two separated singlets  @xcite , and local moment magnetism on the tb@xmath4 site disappears at low tb concentration  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we propose that the re(oh)@xmath6 ( re = ho , dy ) compounds may offer themselves as an attractive class of materials to study the above questions .",
    "similarly to the lihof@xmath2 , the re(oh)@xmath6 materials possess the following interesting properties :    1 .",
    "they are insulating rare earth materials .",
    "their main spin - spin couplings are magnetostatic dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "the re(oh)@xmath6 materials are stable at room temperature .",
    "both pure re(oh)@xmath6 and lihof@xmath2 are colinear ( ising - like ) dipolar ferromagnets with the ising direction along the @xmath54 axis of a hexagonal unit cell ( re(oh)@xmath6 ) or body - centered tetragonal unit cell ( lihof@xmath2 ) . in both cases",
    "there are two magnetically equivalent ions per unit cell .",
    "5 .   in re(oh)@xmath6",
    ", the kramers ( dy@xmath4 ) and non - kramers ( ho@xmath4 ) variants possess a common crystalline structure and both have similar bulk magnetic properties in zero transverse magnetic field @xmath3 . 6 .",
    "the critical temperature of the pure re(oh)@xmath6 compounds is relatively high , @xmath99 .",
    "this would make possible the study of y@xmath100substituted dy and ho hydroxides down to quite low concentration of rare earth while maintaining the relevant magnetic temperature scale above the lowest attainable temperature with a commercial dilution refrigerator .",
    "finally , and this is a key feature that motivated the present study , the first excited crystal field state in the ho(oh)@xmath6 and dy(oh)@xmath6 compounds is low - lying , hence allowing a possible transverse - field induced admixing and , possibly , a transverse field ising model description  @xcite    to the best of our knowledge , it appears that the re(oh)@xmath6 materials have so far not been investigated as potential realization of the tfim .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore ( i ) the possible description of these materials as a tfim , ( ii ) obtain an estimate of what the zero temperature critical transverse field @xmath61 may be and , ( iii ) assess if any new interesting phenomenology may occur , even in the pure compounds , in nonzero transverse field @xmath3 .",
    "we note , however , that there are so far no very large single crystals of re(oh)@xmath5 available  @xcite .",
    "for example , their length typically varies between 3 mm and 17 mm and their diameter between 0.2 and 0.6 mm .",
    "the lack of large single crystals would make difficult neutron scattering experiments .",
    "however , possibly motivated by this work and by a first generation of bulk measurements ( e.g. susceptibility , specific heat ) , experimentalists and solid state chemists may be able to conceive ways to grow larger single crystals of re(oh)@xmath6 .",
    "also , in light of the fact that most experiments on liho@xmath15y@xmath1f@xmath53 that have revealed exotic behavior are bulk measurements  @xcite , we hope that at this time the lack of availability of large single crystals of the re(oh)@xmath5 series is not a strong impediment against pursuing a first generation of bulk experiments on re(oh)@xmath6 .",

    "in this section we show that ho(oh)@xmath5 and tb(oh)@xmath5 can be described with good accuracy by an effective tfim hamiltonian . on the other hand , although dy(oh)@xmath5 has been referred in the literature as an ising material @xcite , we find that it is not possible to describe the magnetic properties of this material within the framework of an effective ising hamiltonian that neglects the effect of the excited crystal field states .    to be able to identify a material as a realization of an effective _ microscopic _ ising model , the following conditions should apply @xcite :    * there has to be a ground state doublet or a close pair of singlets that are separated from the next energy level by an energy gap that is large in comparison with the critical temperature .",
    "this ensures that at the temperatures of interest only the two lowest levels are significantly populated .",
    "* to first order , there has to be no transverse susceptibility .",
    "it means that there should be no matrix elements of @xmath127 operators between the two states of the ground doublet . * furthermore , the longitudinal ( in the easy axis direction ) susceptibility has to be predominantly controlled by the two lowest levels . in other words , there has to be no significant mixing of the states of the lowest doublet with the higher levels via the internal mean field along the ising direction . in more technical terms ,",
    "the van vleck susceptibility should play a negligible role to the non - interacting ( free ion ) susceptibility near the critical temperature  @xcite . * in setting up the above conditions , one is in effect requesting that a material be describable as a tfim from a miscroscopic point of view .",
    "however , one can , alternatively , ask whether the quantum critical point of a given material is in the same universality class as the relevant transverse field ising model .",
    "in such a case , as long as transition is second order , then sufficiently close to the quantum critical point , a mapping to an effective tfim is always in principle possible .",
    "however , it can be difficult to estimate the pertinent parameters entering the ginzburg - landau - wilson theory describing the transition . from that perspective , the first and the third point above are always fulfilled sufficiently close to a second order quantum critical point  @xcite .",

    "<S> it is in this context that we use here mean - field theory to investigate the suitability of the ho(oh)@xmath5 , dy(oh)@xmath5 and tb(oh)@xmath6 insulating hexagonal dipolar ising - like ferromagnets for the study of the quantum phase transition induced by a magnetic field , @xmath3 , applied perpendicular to the ising spin direction . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , the zero field critical ( curie ) temperatures are known to be @xmath7 k , @xmath8 k and @xmath9 k , for ho(oh)@xmath5 , dy(oh)@xmath5 and tb(oh)@xmath5 , respectively . from our calculations </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the critical transverse field , @xmath10 , to destroy ferromagnetic order at zero temperature to be @xmath114.35 t , @xmath115.03 t and @xmath1154.81 t for ho(oh)@xmath5 , dy(oh)@xmath5 and tb(oh)@xmath5 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we find that ho(oh)@xmath5 , similarly to lihof@xmath2 , can be quantitatively described by an effective @xmath12 transverse field ising model ( tfim ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is not the case for dy(oh)@xmath5 due to the strong admixing between the ground doublet and first excited doublet induced by the dipolar interactions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find that the paramagnetic ( pm ) to ferromagnetic ( fm ) transition in dy(oh)@xmath6 becomes first order for strong @xmath3 and low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the pm to fm zero temperature transition in dy(oh)@xmath5 may be first order and not quantum critical . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the effect of competing antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbor exchange and applied magnetic field @xmath13 along the ising spin direction @xmath14 on the first order transition in dy(oh)@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude from these preliminary calculations that ho(oh)@xmath5 and dy(oh)@xmath5 , and their y@xmath4 diamagnetically diluted variants , ho@xmath15y@xmath1(oh)@xmath5 and dy@xmath15y@xmath1(oh)@xmath5 , are potentially interesting systems to study transverse - field induced quantum fluctuations effects in hard axis ( ising - like ) magnetic materials . </S>"
