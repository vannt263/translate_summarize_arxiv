    "avalanche behavior @xcite has been found in many first order phase transitions at low temperatures . when the external parameters are slowly driven , the transition , instead of occurring as a sharp change of the system properties at a certain point of the phase diagram , splits into a series of discontinuous jumps that link metastable states .",
    "this gives rise to hysteresis loops , whose branches consist of a sequence of random steps . in many cases the sizes of such steps range from microscopic to macroscopic scales , distributed according to a power - law .",
    "the phenomenon has been found to be associated with magnetic transitions @xcite , capillary condensation @xcite , martensitic transformations @xcite , and others @xcite . a crucial ingredient in order to observe such avalanches is that thermal fluctuations are very small compared with the energy barriers that separate transformed and untransformed domains .",
    "for this reason , such first - order phase transitions have been called `` athermal '' @xcite or `` fluctuationless '' @xcite .    within this context",
    "the 3d - grfim with metastable dynamics is a prototype model : the complexity of what we call `` disorder '' in a real system is simplified into a series of quenched random fields , gaussian distributed with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath1 , that act on every spin of a 3d ising model .",
    "in addition , one assumes that temperature is zero ( @xmath0 ) and provides the model with a particular metastable dynamics in order to study the evolution of the magnetization @xmath2 when the external field @xmath3 is swept .",
    "the details of the dynamics were introduced by sethna and coworkers a decade ago @xcite .",
    "the basic assumption is that the driving field rate is slow enough so that system relaxation can be considered instantaneous ( adiabatic driving ) .",
    "such relaxations are the so - called magnetization avalanches .",
    "after the introduction of the model several works @xcite described the basic associated phenomenology : ( a ) the existence of a disorder - induced critical point at @xmath4 associated with the change from a continuous to a discontinuous hysteresis loop and ( b ) the fact that within a large region around the critical point the distribution of avalanche sizes @xmath5 exhibits almost power - law behavior .",
    "nevertheless , several questions remain unsolved , mostly related to the properties of the spanning avalanches which are responsible for the observed macroscopic discontinuities in the @xmath3-@xmath2 hysteresis loop and in the @xmath1-@xmath3 phase diagram .",
    "more recently , a fss analysis of the number of avalanches and avalanche size distribution @xcite has revealed that the scenario is quite complex .",
    "the study was restricted to the statistical analysis of the full set of avalanches recorded in a half loop , irrespective of the field values @xmath3 where such avalanches occur .",
    "( the obtained statistical distributions are often called integrated distributions ) . a detailed study as a function of @xmath3",
    "has not been done before .",
    "let us summarize here the main results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to introduce the notation .",
    "according to the dependence on the system size @xmath6 of the average number @xmath7 and size distribution @xmath8 , avalanches can be classified into several categories , ( the subindex @xmath9 stands for the different categories ) as presented in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the scaling behavior is written as a function of the variable @xmath10 which measures the distance to the critical value of the disorder @xmath11 .",
    "its precise definition is given as a second - order expansion : @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "this expression was found to be the best choice for the collapse of the scaling plots .",
    "the values of the different critical exponents are summarized in table [ table2 ] , together with the new exponents that will be computed in the present work .    [ cols=\"<,^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     nevertheless",
    ", we can provide an argument based on renormalization group theory that indicates that the critical points in the two models ( 3d - rfim in equilibrium and the 3d - rfim with metastable dynamics ) correspond to the same fixed point in a more general parameter space . within the framework of rg theory the critical surface ( or critical line )",
    "is defined as the set of all points in the parameter space that flow to a certain critical fixed point when the renormalization group transformation is applied .",
    "the variation of the tunable parameters of a model describes a `` physical '' trajectory in the parameter space .",
    "according to these definitions , the critical point corresponds to the point where the `` physical '' trajectory intersects the critical surface .",
    "the two models discussed here can be considered as particular cases of a more general model with the same 3d - grfim hamiltonian and the following @xmath0 adiabatic dynamics : when @xmath14 is varied , blocks of neighboring spins of size @xmath15 flip when such a flip represents an energy decrease .",
    "the metastable dynamics introduced by sethna corresponds to @xmath16 ( only single spin flips are considered ) and the equilibrium model at @xmath0 ( exact ground - state ) corresponds to @xmath17 . the parameter @xmath18 is a new parameter that must be considered in the rg equations . since a critical point is found both with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , it is natural to assume that this is an irrelevant parameter .",
    "thus , we propose the scenario presented in fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] .",
    "changing @xmath18 alters the position of the critical point , but not the critical exponents which correspond to the same critical fixed point .",
    "numerical simulations of the 3d - grfim with @xmath19 dynamics will help in clarifying this picture . at present",
    "we guess that the rg flow follows the arrows schematically indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] . both the equilibrium critical point ( ecp ) and the metastable critical point ( mcp )",
    "lie on the same critical surface ( cs ) .",
    "in general a first - order phase transition occurs at the points in the parameter space that go towards a discontinuity fixed point when the rg transformation is applied .",
    "@xcite we assume the existence of two discontinuity fixed points : the equilibrium discontinuity fixed point ( edfp ) and the metastable discontinuity fixed point ( mdfp ) .",
    "the edfp controls the first - order phase transition in the equilibrium case ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) and the mdfp controls the first - order phase transition when @xmath22 .",
    "all the points that flow towards any of the discontinuity fixed points define the discontinuity surface ( ds ) where the first - order phase transition occurs .",

    "avalanches can be understood as the zero temperature fluctuations in the driven system .",
    "is their average linear size related to @xmath23 ? .",
    "the first thing to note is that we have found that avalanches display two different fractal dimensions ( and thus different associated @xmath24 exponents ) .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath26 exponents , nevertheless , are the same for all the scaling collapses . for instance , this is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] in this work and by figs . 8 , 9 , and 10 in ref .",
    "thus the behavior of the correlation length is unique : @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "the fluctuations then can `` choose '' between two different mechanisms for propagation either with fractal dimension @xmath29 or with fractal dimension @xmath30 .",
    "the second point to be considered is that @xmath23 can not be related to the size of the subcritical 3d - spanning avalanche since we have found that @xmath23 is finite below @xmath31 .",
    "keeping these two observations in mind we propose that the correlation length is related to the average radius of the largest non - spanning avalanche .",
    "below @xmath32 the existence of a compact subcritical 3d - spanning avalanche does not allow for the non - spanning avalanches to overcome a certain finite length and thus @xmath23 is finite . only at the critical point",
    "does the subcritical 3d - spanning avalanche become fractal and allows for other spanning avalanches to exist and @xmath23 becomes infinite .",
    "this behavior is much similar to what has been recently found in percolation .",
    "@xcite we conjecture that some of the theorems that have been rigorously proven concerning the uniqueness of the infinite percolating cluster should be applicable to our case concerning the compact subcritical 3d - spanning avalanche .",
    "the present results should be considered as an interesting stimulus to proceed with the analysis of percolation theory .",
    "for instance , we propose checking whether the fractal dimension of the spanning clusters is the same as that of the infinite cluster at distances lower than the correlation length at the percolation threshold .",
    "the results presented in this paper are mainly related to two topics in the 3d - grfim : firstly , the field dependence of the spanning avalanches , and secondly , the geometrical properties of the avalanches .",
    "we have extended the fss hypothesis proposed in @xcite to properly take into account the field dependence of the number densities @xmath33 and of the bivariate distributions @xmath34 . when carrying out such an extension , it is necessary to introduce a new scaling variable @xmath35 and a new exponent @xmath26 related to the divergence of the correlation length when @xmath3 approaches @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "we have also introduced a scaling hypothesis for the field @xmath38 at which the different avalanches concentrate and their standard deviation @xmath39 . from the scaling collapses corresponding to the 1d- and 2d - spanning avalanches",
    "we have found @xmath40 .",
    "the study of the 3d - spanning avalanches is more intricate as already shown in @xcite , where we propose the existence of two different kinds of 3d - spanning avalanches . in this paper",
    "we have proposed two approximate separation methods for classifying these avalanches as subcritical or critical . using these methods",
    "we have found that @xmath41 for both cases .",
    "scaling enables the following behavior to be scketched in the thermodynamic limit : the 1d- , 2d- , and critical 3d - spanning avalanches only exist at the critical point @xmath42 , where their number densities are infinite .",
    "in contrast , one subcritical 3d - spanning avalanche exists below @xmath43 and it occurs on the line @xmath44 ( eq .",
    "( [ eq:18.1 ] ) ) .    from the average mass @xmath45",
    "we have obtained the fractal dimensions corresponding to each of the types of spanning avalanches .",
    "this has allowed us to confirm independently the results in @xcite : @xmath46 for the 1d- , 2d- , and subcritical 3d - spanning avalanches and @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , the behavior for @xmath48 of the mass corresponding to the subcritical 3d - spanning avalanches indicates that the correlation length @xmath23 is finite below @xmath31 . as a consequence ,",
    "we conclude that the line @xmath49 , where the discontinuity in the order parameter occurs , corresponds to a standard first - order phase transition line and @xmath23 only diverges at the critical point .",
