    "spectroscopic studies of hyperfine manifolds in alkalies , such as measurements of energy separations , have benefitted by the high precision of the experimental techniques available to interrogate atoms @xcite .",
    "their hydrogen - like structure makes interpretation of experimental results straightforward in terms of electromagnetic fields generated by the valence electron and nuclear moments .",
    "precise measurements in higher excited states accessible through two - step transitions@xcite have appeared in recent years .",
    "this has renewed interest in improving calculations in other states where theoretical methods such as many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) ( see for example the recent book of w. r. johnson @xcite ) are yet to be tested against experimental results .",
    "precise measurements in excited states , beyond the first one , have several experimental complications .",
    "standard spectroscopic techniques rely on the high population of atoms in the ground state to guarantee a good signal to noise ratio of the fluorescence or absorption of the atomic sample . in two - step transitions",
    "this is no longer the case .",
    "the amount of population transferred to the intermediate level , for reasonable powers of the lasers , tends to be small , and detectors at the desired frequency might no be readily available .",
    "we present in this paper two - color modulation transfer spectroscopy as a tool for studies of atomic properties of higher excited states .",
    "the method consist of two lasers ( pump and probe ) counter - propagating through a thermal vapour . before being directed to the interaction region ,",
    "one of the lasers is modulated .",
    "the first step of the transition _",
    "i.e. _ the pump , connects the ground state to a resonant intermediate state while the probe scans over the desired energy manifold .",
    "we monitor the absorption of the pump laser as a function of probe laser detuning .",
    "the non - linear interaction of the lasers  burns a hole \" in the atomic ground state population .",
    "the generated spectra presents sub - doppler peaks ( sometimes called lamb - bennett dips ) corresponding to the atomic resonances with the trademark sidebands at their side .",
    "this technique overcomes the two main inconveniences of direct absorption of the probing laser _ i.e. _ low signal to noise ratio and non - availability of detectors at the desired wavelength .",
    "we present two ladder systems in @xmath0rb to illustrate the main features of the technique and two different applications of the modulation .",
    "we select the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 ladder transitions to illustrate their different uses .",
    "the amplitude of the probe laser is modulated for the first system while the second system has its pump frequency modulated .",
    "the frequency modulation of the pump laser and good signal to noise ratio allows us to lock the probe laser to the @xmath3 excited atomic resonance . in this case",
    "the probe laser remains modulation free .",
    "this is highly desired since the electronic modulation of the laser itself can carry unwanted effects such as sidebands at higher or lower frequencies as well as bandwidth problems .",
    "the method we are presenting is , of course , not limited to these two cases and can be extended to other atomic levels .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : section ii contains the theoretical model , section iii explains the experimental setup and results , section iv has a summary of the precise measurements using this method , and section v presents the conclusions .",
    "we start with a three level model that can show some of the qualitative features of the experimental spectra .",
    "we use a density matrix formalism to describe a three level atom in ladder configuration interacting with two lasers , one of which has sidebands .",
    "we model our system as doppler - free ignoring zeeman sublevels to keep it tractable .",

    "fig [ figure energy levels theory ] ( a ) is a ladder type system with an amplitude modulated probe ( amp ) .",
    "fig ( b ) presents the same system except it has a frequency modulated pump ( fmp ) .",
    "the intermediate and last levels are coupled by a single laser with three frequencies : a carrier and two sidebands separated form the carrier by @xmath4 ( in mhz ) .",
    "we represent the amplitude of the carrier by a rabi frequency @xmath5 and the sidebands by a modulation depth @xmath6 . the ground and intermediate states are coupled by @xmath7 .",
    "the detuning of the carrier between levels @xmath8 and @xmath9 is zero in the model as it is for our experiment and we let the detuning between levels @xmath9 and @xmath10 vary as @xmath11 .",
    "the total population is normalized to unity .",
    "[ figure energy levels theory ] ( b ) follows the same nomenclature except that the sidebands arise from frequency modulation and they appear in the pump laser @xmath7 . for the fmp systems the sidebands have the appropriate sign difference .",
    "we have a set of nine linear equations for the slowly varying elements of the density matrix @xmath12 after using the rotating wave approximation with the sidebands rotating - one clockwise , one counter clockwise - at a frequency @xmath4 .",
    "the equations are :    @xmath13\\sigma_{nm}~+}\\\\    & & \\frac{i}{2}\\sum_{k}(\\alpha_{nk}\\sigma_{km}-\\sigma_{nk}\\alpha_{km})=\\dot{\\sigma}_{nm}~for~n\\neq m,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 is the transition frequency , and @xmath15 is the laser frequency connecting the levels .",
    "the damping rate is given by : @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the fmp system and @xmath18 for the amp system .",
