    "it is a basic feature of the classical world that a massive object residing in a metastable potential well can not decay and , at zero temperature , is determined to reside in the well .",
    "there are , however , situations , where this doctrine is no longer adequate , namely if the system consists of two parts , a classical and a smaller quantum one . in that case , a decay process is possible under certain circumstances : the decay sequence is initiated by the tunneling of the quantum degree of freedom ; through its coupling to the classical part the trapping potential is distorted , eventually turning the metastable state into an unstable one , provided that the distortion is large enough .",
    "we name this decay process the mnchhausen effect after the famous baron telling the story of pulling himself out of a swamp by his own hair .",
    "the above situation can be implemented experimentally in a dynamically asymmetric dc - squid ; it is this specific realization we will study in detail in this paper , see fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] .",
    "the dynamical degrees of freedom in the dc - squid are the gauge - invariant phase differences @xmath5 , across the two josephson junctions . the potential energy ( of a single josephson junction )",
    "is given by @xmath6 , involving the josephson energy @xmath7 ( with the flux unit @xmath8 and the critical current @xmath9 of the junction ) .",
    "the kinetic energy reads @xmath10 , where the capacitances @xmath11 assume the role of effective masses .",
    "hence , a squid featuring two josephson junctions with equal critical current @xmath9 but adequately chosen and strongly asymmetric capacitances , one big and one small ( @xmath12 ) , effectively provides us with a classical and a quantum degree of freedom .",
    "but strongly asymmetric capacitances ( @xmath12 ) and resistances @xmath13 are integrated in a biased ( current @xmath3 ) superconducting loop with symmetric inductance @xmath4 . ]",
    "the fabrication of large , classical junctions is easily achieved today ; however , this is not the case for small quantum junctions whose realization is more difficult . nevertheless , small junctions exhibiting quantum tunneling @xcite and quantum coherence @xcite can be routinely fabricated today .",
    "the decay process of the biased dynamically asymmetric squid proceeds in the following manner : the bias @xmath3 , leading to a term @xmath14 in the potential , turns a stable state of the washboard potential into a metastable one . as junction 1 features a large capacitance , we assume its dynamics to be strictly classical .",
    "if the bias @xmath3 is large enough , a ( imaginary time ) decay process involving only the quantum junction ( at constant @xmath15 ) is enabled .",
    "this phase slip leads to the entry of magnetic flux into the ring .",
    "given the inductive coupling @xmath16 ( inductance @xmath4 ) , the current through the classical junction is enhanced and it may eventually become overcritical , thus decaying via a classical real time trajectory .    in the following , we specify the setup ( sec .  [",

    "[ sec : pd ] , we describe the decay process in more detail and present the resulting dynamical phase diagram .",

    "the lagrangian @xmath18 generates the equations of motion @xmath19 with the ` masses ' @xmath20 and where we have added the dissipative terms @xmath21 with the damping parameters @xmath22 , the normal resistances of the junctions ; the potential ( illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : v ] ) is given by @xmath23 with the dimensionless current @xmath24 , the coupling constant @xmath25 and where energy is measured in units of @xmath26 .",
    "residing in a symmetric ( @xmath27 ) metastable state of the potential @xmath28 at finite bias current @xmath29 , the classical version of the system described through eq .",
    "can not decay at zero temperature . here",
    ", we are investigating the case where junction one , featuring a large capacitance @xmath30 , is assumed to behave strictly classical , whereas the dynamics of junction 2 is characterized by large quantum fluctuations .",
    "this can be achieved through a suitable choice of parameters , i.e. , small capacitance @xmath31 , while keeping @xmath32 such that we remain in a quasi - classical regime .    in the system under consideration",
    ", different scenarios can arise depending on the strength of the dissipation as quantified by the dimensionless damping parameter @xmath33 where , at @xmath34 , the plasma frequency @xmath35 .",
    "the simplest case is the overdamped situation @xmath36 , where the dynamics of the classical junction is viscous and both relaxation and tunneling of the quantum junction are incoherent @xcite .",
    "we will analyze this situation in detail in the next section ; the obtained results are also relevant for other choices of parameters , c.f . below .",
    "in the following , we determine for which currents @xmath29 and coupling constants @xmath37 a zero temperature decay of a symmetric metastable state ( @xmath27 , up to an arbitrary multiple of @xmath38 ) is allowed in the interferometer potential @xmath28 .",
    "the result is displayed in a dynamical phase diagram in the @xmath29-@xmath37-plane , see fig .",
    "[ fig : pd_vv ] , where the critical line @xmath39 separates regions where this decay is prohibited ( localized state ) from regions where it is allowed ( delocalized ) .    assuming junction 1 to behave strictly classical , ( i.e. considering the limit of very large @xmath30 ) , a quantum decay of the squid in a metastable state can only occur at fixed @xmath15 , i.e. through an imaginary - time trajectory of @xmath40 in the effective potential @xmath41 ) .",
    "we will adopt this approximation for all tunneling processes throughout the discussion .",
    "in the case @xmath42 the preparation in the assumed symmetric initial state is straightforward : a squid is cooled close to zero temperature at zero external magnetic field before a bias current is ramped to the desired value @xmath29 .",
    "the ramp needs to be fast enough , such that the final current is reached before the decay of the quantum junction ; any initial potential energy is dissipated as the phases relax to the bottom of the metastable well",
    ".    for undercritical currents @xmath43 the described initial state , @xmath27 , is stable against a decay involving the classical junction ; however it is , for @xmath44 , unstable with respect to a quantum decay of @xmath40 since the minimum of @xmath45 near @xmath46 is lowered below the initial one and one or more phase slips of @xmath40 are possible . in order to determine whether the squid will remain in a stable or enter a finite voltage state at given @xmath47 we proceed in two steps : first , we have to determine where the successive quantum tunneling of @xmath40 comes to a halt , i.e. which side minimum is quantum - stable .",
    "this is equivalent to finding the global minimum of the effective potential @xmath45 .",
    "fixing the phase across the classical junction @xmath48 , one immediately sees that the quantum - stable minimum is the one near @xmath49 if @xmath50 is the largest integer such that @xmath51 the sequence of phase slips of the quantum junction leads to an accumulation of magnetic flux in the squid loop , inducing a screening current .",
    "consequently , the current through junction 2 is reduced whilst that through junction 1 is increased .",
    "the magnitude of the induced current depends strongly on the coupling constant @xmath37 ; for given @xmath50 , it is only large enough to drive the classical junction overcritical if @xmath52 if this is the case , the squid enters a finite voltage state where quantum tunneling of junction 2 ( an approximate flux unit enters the loop ) and classical relaxation of junction 1 ( flux leaves the loop ) interchange sequentially ( see fig .",

    "the macroscopic quantum tunneling of the small junction 2 .",
    "a continuous sequence of phase slips takes the system to a state which is classically unstable . in the following ,",

    "first , the condition of classical stability is but the standard determination of the critical current of a dc - squid s asymmetric minimum @xcite . in our case , where classical stability along the @xmath40-direction is guaranteed , the relevant set of equations is given by @xmath56 and has to be solved ( numerically ) for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the coordinates of the true minima near @xmath59 .",

    "the dotted lines mark the entry of a additional flux into the squid loop . on the higher - bias side of the critical line ,",
    "the dashed lines show how many flux units are at least needed to render the squid unstable .",
    "the inset shows a close up on the critical line and additionally displays the exact numerical solution ( dashed ) . ]",
    "a few remarks on the above results are in place .",
    "first , the setup as described above may not be suitable for experimental investigations as an overdamped quantum junction suffers from strongly suppressed tunneling rates .",
    "however , the analogous results can be obtained by using two underdamped junctions and ramping the current sufficiently slowly , such that the junctions have dissipated all energy before crossing any line ( solid or dotted ) in the phase diagram fig .",
    "[ fig : pd_vv ] .",
    "the hallmark of the `` mnchhausen - effect '' in this case is the two different types of decay that finally initiate a running state : if the critical line is crossed on a part with positive slope , the quantum stable minimum is classically unstable immediately and a finite voltage state is initiated by the last quantum tunneling process . on the other hand , if the critical line is crossed on a part with negative slope , the quantum - stable minimum is still classically stable after the tunneling and needs to be turned overcritical by increasing the bias .",
    "then , the finite voltage state is initiated by a purely classical decay .",
    "the difference between the two types of decay should be visible upon analyzing the decay histograms of multiple measurements , being broad for a quantum decay but narrow for a classical process .",
    "second , one has to take into account that for realistic systems , where the capacitance asymmetry is introduced by a capacitive shunt @xcite , the maximum asymmetry is limited .",
    "corrections due to the finite mass of the classical junction might appear in the form of two - dimensional quantum tunneling , where junction 1 takes part in the tunneling process @xcite .",
    "we have shown that a dc - squid can decay out of a symmetric metastable state , even if one of the junctions behaves _ fully _ classical , provided the second junction shows quantum behavior .",
    "the `` mnchhausen - decay '' involves tunneling of the quantum junction , where magnetic flux accumulates in the superconducting ring and eventually redirects enough current through the classical junction as to drive it overcritical .",
