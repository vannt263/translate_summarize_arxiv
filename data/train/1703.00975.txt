    "a century after einstein s discovery namely general relativity , the domain of its applications has become as vast as it covers even condensed matter physics which seemed at the opposite end of physics building compared to gravity @xcite .",
    "this strange topic which connects gravity to almost all fields of physics ( see @xcite ) is called gauge / gravity duality ( ggd ) ; the extended version of ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "ggd has attracted increasing interests during recent years and become one of the most promising fields of physics which is hoped to be able to solve many of unsolved problems in different fields of physics including condensed matter physics .",
    "real materials in condensed matter physics do not respect the translational symmetry i.e. there is a dissipation in momentum .",
    "the momentum dissipation may come from the existence of a lattice or impurities .",
    "although this dissipation has no important influence on the values of some observable , it affects the behavior of some others for instance conductivity .",
    "the dc conductivity in the presence of translational symmetry diverges , whereas in the absence of this symmetry ( when momentum is dissipating ) it has a finite value . in the context of ggd ,",
    "it is important to study a gravity model which includes holographic momentum dissipation .",
    "there are some attempts to construct such gravity model @xcite .",
    "one of these models proposed by d. vegh @xcite , provides an effective bulk description of a theory in which momentum is no longer conserved .",
    "the conservation of momentum is due to the diffeomorphism invariance of stress - energy tensor in dual theory . in @xcite ,",
    "the proposal is to break this symmetry holographically by giving a mass to graviton state .",
    "the resulting gravity is therefore _",
    "massive gravity_. one of the advantages of this theory is that the black hole solutions of it are solvable analytically and therefore it is an excellent toy model to study holographically the properties of materials without momentum conservation .",
    "thermal behaviors of black hole solutions in the context of massive gravity was explored extensively in recent years @xcite .",
    "thermodynamics of linearly charged massive black branes has been investigated in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a class of higher - dimensional linearly charged solutions with positive , negative and zero constant curvature of horizon in the context of massive gravity accompanied by a negative cosmological constant has been presented and thermodynamics and phase structure of these black solutions have been studied in both canonical and grand canonical ensembles . in @xcite ,",
    "van der waals phase transitions of linearly charged black holes in massive gravity have been investigated and it has been shown that the massive gravity can present substantially different thermodynamic behavior in comparison with einstein gravity . also it has been shown that the graviton mass can cause a range of new phase transitions for topological black holes which are forbidden for other cases . from holographic point of view , the behaviors of different holographic quantities have been studied vegh , holo,1404.5321,1407.0306,1504.00535,1507.03105,1612.03627 .",
    "the behavior of holographic conductivity for systems dual to linearly charged massive black branes has been explored in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a holographic superconductor has been constructed in the massive gravity background .",

    "@xcite presents a holographic model for insulator / metal phase transition and colossal magnetoresistance within massive gravity .",
    "inspired by the recent action / complexity duality conjecture , it has been shown in @xcite that the holographic complexity grows linearly with time in the context of massive gravity .",
    "as we mentioned above , one of the quantities which is affected by momentum dissipation is conductivity . on the other hand",
    ", the choice of electrodynamics model has a direct influence on the behavior of conductivity .",
    "this motivates us to extend the linearly charged black hole solutions of massive gravity @xcite to nonlinearly charged ones in the presence of power - law maxwell electrodynamics and investigate the thermodynamics of them as well as the behavior of conductivity corresponding to the dual system .",
    "the power - law maxwell electrodynamics was first proposed in @xcite in order to extend the invariance of maxwell lagrangian under conformal transformation @xmath17 , @xmath18 in four dimensions , to higher spacetime dimensions .",
    "this invariance gives rise to a traceless energy - momentum tensor for electrodynamics .",
