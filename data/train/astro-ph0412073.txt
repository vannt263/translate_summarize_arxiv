    "a geometrically thick dusty torus has been recently resolved in the well - known seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 by an infrared interferometry telescope ( jaffe et al .",
    "2004 ; hereafter ) .",
    "the dusty torus , as an essential ingredient in the unification scheme of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , plays a key role in obscuring the broad line region ( antonucci & miller 1985 ; antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "how to maintain the thickness of the torus has long been puzzling in agn physics .",
    "krolik & begelman ( 1988 ) suggested that the dusty torus is composed of discrete compressed clouds and supported by the random supersonic motion of clouds in @xmath6-direction .",
    "however , the inevitable collisions among the clouds dissipate their kinetic energy , an extra supply of kinetic energy to the clouds , such as a star cluster , is thus needed ( krolik & begelman 1988 ; jaffe et al .",
    "what are the observational consequences of the collisions ?",
    "vlba ( very long baseline array ) has resolved the radio components in the core region of ngc 1068 .",
    "the radio component @xmath3 at the center of the nucleus is coincident with the most powerful infrared source in ngc 1068 ( bock et al .",
    "2000 ; jaffe et al .",
    "the component @xmath3 should therefore relate to the dusty torus somehow physically",
    ". the inner edge of the hypothesized torus will be ionized by uv and x - rays from the accretion disk and is expected to be optically thick to free - free absorption at ghz frequencies ( neufeld et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the free - free emission is suggested for the radio emission of the component @xmath3 from hot ionized gas of a temperature @xmath7k and number density @xmath8@xmath9 evaporated from dust , and the inverted spectrum below 5ghz in ngc 1068 is explained by the ionized gas via free - free absorption with a total amount of @xmath10 ( gallimore et al .",
    "2004 ) . for typical values of the parameters ,",
    "the ablation rate is of @xmath11 via photo - ionization ( krolik & begelman 1988 ) , the timescale for the required mass of the ionized gas will be of @xmath12yr .",
    "however , the free - free emission from hot ionized gas is proportional to the square of particle density and its cooling timescale is of , @xmath13yr , for the inferred ionized gas , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath16 , namely , most of the ionized gas ( @xmath17 ) can not be maintained and will re - condense to dust .",
    "so there is no enough ionized gas to absorb the radio emission below 5  ghz in the model suggested by gallimore et al .",
    "the fact that the component @xmath3 nicely overlaps with the region of the most infrared bright torus ( jaffe et al .",
    "2004 ) strongly implies that the radio emission from @xmath3 is linked with the torus itself .",
    "the explanation of this radio emission remains open .",
    "does it relate to collisions among the clouds ?    in this letter , we focus on the observational consequences of the collisions among the clouds and show that shocks due to collisions accelerate populations of relativistic electrons .",
    "non - thermal emission will be radiated as observational consequences from radio to gev @xmath1-rays .",
    "we apply this model to ngc 1068 and suggest that the radio emission of the component @xmath3 originates from the synchrotron emission of population of the relativistic electrons .",
    "the predicted @xmath1-ray emission can be detected by _ gamma - ray large - array space telescope _ ( _ glast _ ) .",
    "this provides a new clue to test the mechanism supporting the torus .",
    "the detail micro - physics of clouds has been discussed by krolik & begelman ( 1988 ) .",
    "the clouds are supported by self - gravity and magnetic field .",
    "random motions of the clouds in the vertical direction support the thickness , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the height of the torus , @xmath20 is the random velocity in vertical direction and @xmath21 is the keplerian velocity of the clouds at the mid - plane .",
    "we then have @xmath22 , implying @xmath23 .",
    "it is expected that the clouds in torus are undergoing collisions in such a torus .",
    "the clumpy torus can be described by the clumpiness @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the column density of each cloud and the mean column density of the torus , respectively .",
    "genzel et al .",
    "( 1985 ) estimate @xmath27 in the galactic center .",
    "the total kinetic energy dissipated by the collisions for typical values of the parameters is given by krolik & begelman ( 1988 ) @xmath28 where the column density of the torus @xmath29  @xmath30 and the distance to the black hole @xmath31 .",
    "part of this power is used to evaporate dust and left forms shocks which accelerate populations of relativistic electrons .",
    "we do not tackle the energy supply to the clouds in this paper .",
    "the magnetic field in a cloud is expressed in term of the plasma parameter defined by @xmath32 , @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and the temperature of the torus @xmath37k .",
    "the lamor gyration radius @xmath38 of an electron with lorentz factor @xmath39 is @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "this radius is much shorter than the size of the dusty torus .",
    "the temperature of the shocked gas during the collision is given by @xmath43 where march number @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 the sound speed . the shock velocity with respect to the unshocked gas @xmath47",
    "are given by @xmath48^{1/2 }      \\approx 2.97\\times 10 ^ 7t_6^{1/2}~({\\rm cm~s^{-1}}),\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the adiabatic index , @xmath50 the boltzman constant , @xmath51 the proton mass and @xmath52k the temperature of the shocked gas .",
    "the timescale of accelerating electrons reads ( blandford & eichler 1987 ) @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the light speed .",
    "[ fig1 ]    the energy density of infrared photons inside the torus , which is reprocessed radiation from the accretion disk , can be estimated by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the infrared luminosity from the torus .",
    "we find @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is energy density of the magnetic field .",
    "thus the cooling of the relativistic electrons is mainly due to inverse compton scattering of the infrared photons .",
    "the maximum energy of the electrons will be determined by the balances between the shock acceleration and the inverse compton scattering of the ir photons inside the dusty torus .",
    "the timescale of energy loss due to inverse compton ( ic ) scattering is given by @xmath59 the maximum energy reaches when the acceleration timescale is equal to the ic timescale , @xmath60 the shock acceleration is known to generally accelerate a power law distribution of relativistic electrons as @xmath61 , namely , the electron distribution function is @xmath62 which follows from the energy equation that the relativistic electron is getting energy from the dissipation of the cloud collision @xmath63 where @xmath64  ( @xmath65 ) is the energy loss rate of the electron due to inverse compton scattering ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) . here",
    "@xmath66 is the fraction of the thermal energy converted into the energy of the relativistic electrons .      for a steady torus ,",
    "the cloud collisions provide a constant energy supply to relativistic electrons .",
    "we have shown synchrotron losses of the electrons are much less than the inverse compton scattering of the infrared photons . however the synchrotron radiation from the electrons is detectable in radio band as one observational consequence . the emergent spectrum from the torus",
    "will be given by the synchrotron and inverse compton scattering emission .",
    "the peak frequency of the synchrotron emission is @xmath67 peaking at middle or near infrared band .",
    "this just overlaps with the peak frequency of the reprocessing of the disk and thus is under - detectable .",
    "we approximate the reprocessing of dusty torus as a black body with a single black body temperature of @xmath68k , where the black body radiation constant @xmath69erg  @xmath9  deg@xmath70 .",
    "the averaged energy of the infrared photons is @xmath71ev in torus , we have the peak of the inverse compton scattering @xmath72 we use the standard formulations of synchrotron and inverse compton scattering including klein - nishina effects to calculate the spectra from torus for the typical values ( blumenthal & gould 1970 ) .",
    "the ratio of energy densities of magnetic field to synchrotron photons is of @xmath73 for the typical values of the parameters , so self - compton scattering emission can be neglected .",
    "figure 1 shows the spectra for different electron index , but the injected energy @xmath74 is fixed .    the synchrotron spectrum beyond radio band overlaps with the reprocessed emission from the torus itself . since it is much lower than the later , this predicted component will be invisible or undistinguished .",
    "however , the component of @xmath75  kev spectrum will be observable because the overlapped continuum from disk / corona has a cutoff at 100kev .",
    "this is a key feature of the present model .",
    "this component if detected only originates from the torus .",
    "we emphasize that the non - thermal emission from torus is isotropic in the present model .",
    "the predicted spectra should be testable for any seyfert galaxies as long as the dusty torus exists like in ngc 1068 . in the present model ,",
    "the soft x - ray emission lines are invisible since they are too faint compared with the soft x - ray spectrum of the nucleus .",
    "the model of gallimore et al .",
    "( 2004 ) predicts strong features in the soft x - ray band , but obscured by the torus itself in ngc 1068 . it would be interesting to test the model suggested by gallimore et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in seyfert 1 galaxies , which have dusty tori and the predicted luminous soft x - ray emission lines unobscured by the tori will be viewed by _",
    "chandra_. the present model does not depend on the types of seyfert galaxies provided there are geometrically thick tori in these objects .",
    "so it is not difficult to distinguish the two different models in principle .",
    "the amount of the ionized gas can be estimated from the balance between the free - free cooling and the ablation of dust in the torus .",
    "the ablation timescale is @xmath76 , where the mass of the ionized gas is @xmath77 and @xmath78 the number density of the ionized gas .",
    "we then have @xmath79 from @xmath80 .",
    "the optical depth of free - free absorption of the ionized gas is @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "it is thus impossible for free - free absorption to cause an invert spectrum at @xmath84 ghz .",
    "the free - free emission from the ionized gas is of @xmath85 ( erg  s@xmath86 , much lower than synchrotron radiation from the relativistic electrons . here",
    "the gaunt factor is neglected in our estimations .",
    "the thermal electrons from the evaporation has a thomson scattering depth of @xmath87 .",
    "this value is consistent with the fraction of the polarized emission to the total due to the thermal electrons ( antounucci & miller 1985 ) .",
    "additionally the free - free emission gets a peak flux of @xmath88erg / s at @xmath89kev , which is overwhelmed by the radiation from the core .",
    "we can not detect such a faint radiation component .",
    "the eddington ratio is roughly @xmath90 , where the mass of the black hole @xmath91 estimated from maser observation ( greenhill et al .",
    "1997 ) and the bolometric luminosity @xmath92erg / s by integrating the multiwavelength continuum ( woo & urry 2002 ) .",
    "it is much higher than the critical accretion rate of advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) .",
    "this indicates that the radio emission from the component @xmath3 can not originate from an optically thin adaf in ngc 1068 .",
    "roy et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggested that the component @xmath3 may originate from synchrotron radiation from the relativistic electrons , but it remains open how to accelerate electrons .    0.5 cm    table 1 future observations    0.1 cm    [ cols=\"<,<,<,^ \" , ]     we use the typical values of the parameters in the present model .",
    "the dissipation rate of the kinetic energy via cloud collisions is @xmath93ergs / s , and @xmath94 .",
    "the radiation luminosity via inverse compton scattering is of @xmath95ergs / s .",
    "we find that the radio spectrum of @xmath3 can be generally fitted by synchrotron emission .",
    "the most prominent character in figure 1 is the gev bump , which is caused by inverse compton scattering of the infrared photons inside the torus .",
    "this bump corresponds to a flux of @xmath96 photons  @xmath30  s@xmath97 at 1  gev and @xmath98 photons  @xmath30  s@xmath97 at @xmath75mev .",
    "detection of this component is essential to probe physics inside the torus .",
    "seyfert galaxies have been observed by _ egret _ , showing upper limit with 2@xmath99 ( lin et al .",
    "table 1 lists the sensitivities of several missions .",
    "the last column gives the comments to observations .",
    "we find that the italian mission _ agile _ could marginally detect gev bump in ngc 1068 and _ glast _ has capability of detecting this gev bump .",
    "the synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ) depth is numerically given by @xmath100 ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103gauss ) at @xmath104 ghz , where @xmath105 , for a spatially homogeneous distribution of the relativistic electrons inside the torus .",
    "this shows less importance of the ssa , however we note that this may severely underestimate @xmath106 depending on the spatial density distribution of the electrons .",
    "this is because we use the number density of the relativistic electrons averaged over the entire torus , which is much lower than the local .",
    "additionally , the ghz spectrum may rely on the break energy of the electron distribution , which is determined by the detail of processes of the acceleration and cooling .",
    "we remain it as a free parameter to fit the spectrum since we pay main attention to the observational consequences of cloud collisions .",
    "future detail numerical simulations of cloud collisions may display some details of accelerations so that the minimum energy of the electrons and ssa depth will be given .",
    "collisions simultaneously lead to loss of angular momentum of molecular clouds and then determine the accretion rate of the black hole ( krolik & begelman 1988 ) . therefore the present model predicts a strong correlation between the radio emission from torus and a parameter representing the accretion rate .",
    "indeed ulvestad & ho ( 2001 ) find a very strong correlation , @xmath107}^{\\sim 1.5}$ ] ( estimated from their fig 5 ) in the palomar seyfert galaxies , where @xmath108}$ ] is the [ o iii ] luminosity and @xmath109 is the radio emission power at 6 cm .",

    "we note that the collisions lead to angular momentum loss of clouds , which will be accreted onto the black hole .",
    "therefore the radio emission and @xmath112}$ ] are related with the physics of cloud collisions .",
    "the @xmath113}$ ] correlation could be explained by the present model .",
    "the predicted radio flux in the present model depends on electron index @xmath114 , a more careful study on this will be carried out in future .",
    "the isotropic radiation of the relativistic electrons may imply a significant contribution to the @xmath1-ray background radiation .",
    "if the typical @xmath1-ray luminosity from torus is of @xmath115erg / s , we have the contributed flux to the @xmath1-ray background radiation @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is agn number density peak , @xmath118 is the shell volume of the agn number peak at redshift @xmath119 and @xmath120 is the distance the peak shell .",
    "we have the contribution of agn torus to the @xmath1-ray background @xmath121 for @xmath122 from x - ray observation ( steffen et al .",
    "2003 ) and the peak shell width @xmath123 .",

    "it is interesting to note that the background emission spectrum shows increases below 0.6  gev ( loeb & waxman 2000 ) .",
    "it is worth investigating this subject in detail further .",
