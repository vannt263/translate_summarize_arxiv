    "chaotic behavior in hamiltonian systems with many degrees of freedom has been the subject of intense investigation in the last fifty years , see e.g. [ lichtenberg & lieberman , 1991 ; mackay & meiss , 1987 ; wiggins , 1988 ] and @xcite . by degrees of freedom ( dof )",
    "we are referring to the number of canonically conjugate pairs of positions and momentum variables , @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively , with @xmath22 .",
    "the relevance of these systems to problems of practical concern can not be overemphasized .",
    "their applications range from the stability of the solar system @xcite and the containment of charged particles in high intensity magnetic fields @xcite to the blow  up of hadron beams in high energy accelerators @xcite and the understanding of the properties of simple molecules and hydrogen  bonded systems @xcite .",
    "one of the most fundamental areas in which the dynamics of multi  degree of freedom hamiltonian systems has played ( and continues to play ) a crucial role is the study of transport phenomena in one  dimensional ( @xmath23d ) lattices and the role of chaos in providing a link between deterministic and statistical behavior @xcite . in this context",
    ", a lattice of @xmath0 dof is expected , in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath6 at fixed energy density @xmath12 ) to exhibit chaotic behavior for almost all initial configurations , satisfying at least the property of ergodicity .",
    "this would allow the use of probability densities , leading from the computation of orbits to the study of statistical quantities like ensemble averages and transport coefficients .",
    "chaotic regions , where nearby solutions diverge exponentially from each other , provide an excellent `` stage '' on which such a desired transition from classical to statistical mechanics can occur . however , the presence of significantly sized islands ( or tori ) of quasiperiodic motion , in which the dynamics is `` stable '' for long times , preclude the success of this scenario and make any attempt at a globally valid statistical description seriously questionable .",
    "these tori occur e.g. around _ simple periodic orbits _ which are stable under small perturbations and ,",
    "if their size does not shrink to zero as @xmath0 or @xmath1 increases , their presence can attribute global consequences to a truly local phenomenon .    that such important periodic orbits do exist in hamiltonian lattices , even in the @xmath6 limit ,",
    "could not have been more dramatically manifested than in the remarkable discovery of discrete breathers ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which by now have been observed in a great many experimental situations [ eisenberg _ et al . _ , 1998 ; schwarz _ et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ; fleischer _ et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ; sato _ et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ] .",
    "discrete breathers are precisely one such kind of stable periodic orbits , which also happen to be localized in space , thus representing a very serious limitation to energy transport in nonlinear lattices .    then , there were , of course , the famous numerical experiments of fermi , pasta and ulam of the middle @xmath24 s @xcite , which demonstrated the existence of recurrences that prevent energy equipartition among the modes of certain @xmath23d lattices , containing nonlinear interactions between nearest neighbors .",
    "these finite , so ",
    "called fpu hamiltonian systems were later shown to exhibit a transition to `` global '' chaos , at high enough energies where major resonances overlap @xcite . before that transition , however , an energy threshold to a `` weak '' form of chaos was later discovered that relies on the interaction of the first few lowest frequency modes and , at least for the fpu system , does appear to ensure equipartition among all modes [ de luca _ et al .",
    "_ , @xmath25 ; de luca & lichtenberg , @xmath26 .",
    "interestingly enough , very recently , this transition to `` weak '' chaos was shown to be closely related to the destabilization of one of the lowest frequency nonlinear normal mode of this fpu system @xcite .",
    "thus , today , @xmath27 years after its famous discovery , the fermi  pasta ",
    "ulam problem and its transition from recurrences to true statistical behavior is still a subject of ongoing investigation @xcite .    in this paper , we have sought to approach the problem of global chaos in hamiltonian systems , by considering two paradigms of @xmath0 dof , @xmath23d nonlinear lattices , with very different origins .",
    "one is the famous fpu lattice mentioned above , with quadratic and quartic nearest neighbor interactions , described by the hamiltonian @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the displacement of the @xmath30th particle from its equilibrium position , @xmath31 is the corresponding canonically conjugate momentum of @xmath29 , @xmath32 is a positive real constant and @xmath1 is the value of the hamiltonian representing the total energy of the system .",
    "the other one is obtained by a discretization of a partial differential equation ( pde ) of the nonlinear schrdinger type referred to as the gross  pitaevskii equation @xcite , which in dimensionless form reads @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the planck constant , @xmath35 is a positive constant ( repulsive interactions between atoms in the condensate ) and @xmath36 is an external potential .    equation ( [ gross  pitaevskii equation ] ) is related to the phenomenon of bose ",
    "einstein condensation ( bec ) @xcite .",
    "here we consider the simple case @xmath37 , @xmath38 and discretize the @xmath39dependence of the complex variable @xmath40 in ( [ gross  pitaevskii equation ] ) , approximating the second order derivative by @xmath41 .",
    "setting then @xmath42 and @xmath43 , one immediately obtains from the above pde ( [ gross  pitaevskii equation ] ) a set of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) for the canonically conjugate variables , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , described by the bec hamiltonian @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are constant parameters , @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath1 is the total energy of the system .    in sec .",
    "[ sec_2 ] , we study these hamiltonians , focusing on some simple periodic orbits ( spos ) , which are known in closed form and whose local ( linear ) stability analysis can be carried out to arbitrary accuracy . by spos",
    ", we refer here to periodic solutions where all variables return to their initial state after only one maximum and one minimum in their oscillation , i.e. all characteristic frequencies have unit ratios . in particular ,",
    "we examine first their bifurcation properties to determine whether they remain stable for arbitrarily large @xmath1 and @xmath0 , having perhaps finitely sized islands of regular motion around them .",
    "this was found to be true only for the so  called in  phase  mode ( ipm ) of the bec hamiltonian ( [ bec_hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "spos corresponding to out  of  phase motion ( opm ) of either the fpu ( [ fpu_hamiltonian ] ) or the bec system ( [ bec_hamiltonian ] ) destabilize at energy densities @xmath51 , with @xmath52 or @xmath53 ( for the spos we studied ) , as @xmath6 .",
    "the same result was also obtained for what we call the ohs mode of the fpu system @xcite , where all even indexed particles are stationary and all others execute out  of  phase oscillation , under fixed or periodic boundary conditions .",
    "all these are in agreement with detailed analytical results obtained for families of spos of the same fpu system under periodic boundary conditions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "then , in sec",
    ".  [ sec_3 ] , we vary the values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 and study the behavior of the lyapunov exponents of the opms of the fpu and bec hamiltonians .",
    "we find that , as the eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix exit the unit circle on the real axis , at energies @xmath54 , for fixed @xmath0 , all positive lyapunov exponents @xmath2 , increase following two distinct power laws , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , with the @xmath55 s as reported in the literature , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as the energy @xmath1 grows at fixed @xmath0 , the real eigenvalues of the opm orbit of fpu continue to move away from @xmath9 , unlike the opm of the bec hamiltonian , where for very large @xmath1 all these eigenvalues tend to return to @xmath10 .",
    "interestingly enough , the ipm of the bec hamiltonian remains stable for all the energies and number of dof we studied !    in sec .",
    "[ sec_4 ] , we turn to the question of the `` size '' of islands around stable spos and use the smaller alignment index ( sali ) , introduced in earlier papers @xcite to distinguish between regular and chaotic trajectories in our two hamiltonians .",
    "first , we verify again in these multi  degree of freedom systems the validity of the sali dependence on the two largest lyapunov exponents @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the case of chaotic motion , to which it owes its effectiveness and predictive power .",
    "then , computing the sali , at points further and further away from stable spos , we determine approximately the `` magnitude '' of these islands and find that it vanishes ( as expected ) at the points where the corresponding opms destabilize .",
    "in fact , for the opm of the fpu system the size of the islands decreases monotonically before destabilization while for the bec orbit the opposite happens !",
    "even more remarkably , for the ipm of the bec hamiltonian ( [ bec_hamiltonian ] ) , not only does the `` size '' of the island not vanish , it even grows with increasing energy and remains of considerable magnitude for all the values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 we considered .    finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec_5 ] , using as initial conditions the unstable spos , we compute the lyapunov spectra of the fpu and bec systems in the so  called thermodynamic limit , i.e.  as the energy @xmath1 and the number of dof @xmath0 grow indefinitely , with energy density @xmath58 fixed .",
    "first , we find that lyapunov exponents , fall on smooth curves of the form @xmath59 , for both systems .",
    "then , computing the kolmogorov ",
    "sinai entropy @xmath60 , as the sum of the positive lyapunov exponents @xcite , in the thermodynamic limit , we find , for both hamiltonians , that @xmath60 is an extensive quantity as it grows linearly with @xmath0 , demonstrating that in their chaotic regions the fpu and bec hamiltonians behave as ergodic systems of statistical mechanics .",
    "we consider a @xmath23d lattice of @xmath0 particles with nearest neighbor interactions given by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath29 is the displacement of the @xmath30th particle from its equilibrium position , @xmath31 is the corresponding canonically conjugate momentum of @xmath29 and @xmath32 is a positive real constant .",
    "imposing fixed boundary conditions @xmath62 one finds a simple periodic orbit first studied by @xcite , taking @xmath0 odd , which we shall call the ohs mode ( using ooyama s , hirooka s and sait s initials ) @xmath63 here , we shall examine analytically the stability properties of this mode and determine the energy range @xmath64 over which it is linearly stable .",
    "the equations of motion associated with hamiltonian ( [ fpu_hamiltonian_2 ] ) are @xmath65 whence , using the boundary condition ( [ fpu_fixed_boundary_conditions_ohs ] ) and the expressions ( [ fpu_non_lin_mode_fixed_boundary_conditions_ohs ] ) for every @xmath66 , we arrive at a single equation @xmath67 describing the anharmonic oscillations of all odd particles of the initial lattice .",

    "in this section , we estimate the `` size '' of islands of regular motion around stable spos using the smaller alignment index ( sali ) method @xcite , to distinguish between regular and chaotic orbits in the fpu and bec hamiltonians .",
    "the computation of the sali has proved to be a very efficient method in revealing rapidly and with certainty the regular vs. chaotic nature of orbits , as it exhibits a completely different behavior for the two cases : it fluctuates around non ",

    "we focused on solutions located in the neighborhood of simple periodic orbits and showed that as the energy increases beyond the destabilization threshold , all positive lyapunov exponents increase monotonically with two distinct power ",
    "law dependencies on the energy .",
    "we also computed the destabilization energy per particle of the ohs mode and of the two opm orbits and found that it decays with a simple power  law of the form @xmath7 , @xmath193 1 or 2 .",
    "one notable exception is the ipm orbit of the bec hamiltonian , which is found to be stable for any energy and number of dof we considered !",
    "furthermore , we found that as we increase the energy @xmath1 of both hamiltonians for fixed @xmath0 , the spos behave in very different ways : in the opm case of the fpu hamiltonian the eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix always move away from @xmath9 with increasing energy , while in the opm of the bec hamiltonian these eigenvalues return to @xmath10 , for very high energies .",
    "nevertheless , this behavior does not represent a return of the system to a globally regular motion around the spo as one might have thought .",
    "it simply reflects a local property of the spo , as the orbits in its neighborhood still have positive lyapunov exponents which are far from zero .",
    "we have also been able to estimate the `` size '' of the islands of stability around the spos with the help of a recently introduced very efficient indicator called sali and have seen them to shrink , as expected , when increasing @xmath0 for fixed @xmath1 in the case of the opm of the fpu hamiltonian .",
    "of course , when we continue increasing the energy , keeping the number of dof fixed , the opms destabilize and the islands of stability are destroyed .",
    "unexpectedly , however , in the case of the opm of the bec hamiltonian these islands were seen to _ grow _ in size if we keep @xmath0 fixed and increase @xmath1 up to the destabilization threshold , a result that clearly requires further investigation .",
    "the peculiarity of our bec hamiltonian is even more vividly manifested in the fact that the islands of stability about its ipm orbit never vanish , remaining actually of significant size , even for very high values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( keeping @xmath12 fixed ) .",
    "starting always near unstable spos , we also calculated the lyapunov spectra characterizing chaotic dynamics in the regions of the ohs and opm solutions of both hamiltonians .",
    "keeping @xmath0 fixed , we found energy values where these spectra were practically the same near spos which are far apart in phase space , indicating that the chaotic regions around these spos are visited ergodically by each other s orbits",
    ". finally , using an exponential law accurately describing these spectra , we were able to show , for both hamiltonians , that the associated kolmogorov ",
    "sinai entropies per particle increase linearly with @xmath0 in the thermodynamic limit of @xmath194 and @xmath6 and fixed @xmath12 and , therefore , behave as extensive quantities of statistical mechanics .",
    "our results suggest , however , that , even in that limit , there may well exist hamiltonian systems with significantly sized islands of stability around stable spos ( like the ipm of the bec hamiltonian ) , which must be excluded from a rigorous statistical description .",
    "it is possible , of course , that these islands are too small in comparison with the extent of the chaotic domain on a constant energy surface and their `` measure '' may indeed go to zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "but as long as @xmath1 and @xmath0 are finite , they will still be there , precluding the global definition of probability densities , ensemble averages and the validity of the ergodic hypothesis over all phase space .",
    "clearly , therefore , their study is of great interest and their properties worth pursuing in hamiltonian systems of interest to physical applications .",
