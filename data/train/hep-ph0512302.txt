    "in flexible brane - world ( bw ) models , branons are the only new relevant low - energy particles @xcite .",
    "the sm - branon low - energy effective lagrangian reads @xcite : @xmath0 branons interact by pairs with the sm energy - momentum tensor @xmath1 , and their couplings are suppressed by the brane tension @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , they are generically stable and weakly interacting .",
    "these features make them natural dark matter @xcite candidates . on the other hand ,",
    "the branon phenomenology is very rich since they are coupled with the entire sm .",
    "the branon signals can be characterized by their number @xmath3 , the brane tension scale @xmath4 , and their masses @xmath5 .",
    "for example , from the effective action given in equation ( [ lag ] ) , one can calculate the relevant cross - sections for different branon searches in colliders ( see table [ tabhad ] and references @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the corresponding missing energy signatures , branons can also give rise to new effects through radiative corrections . by integrating out the branon fields in the action coming from @xmath6 it",
    "is possible to obtain an effective action for the sm particles @xcite whose more relevant terms are : @xmath7    .[radcoll ] limits from virtual branon searches at colliders ( results at the @xmath8 c.l . ) the indices @xmath9 denote the two - photon , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) channels respectively .",
    "the first four analysis have been performed with real data , whereas the final four are estimations .",
    "the first two columns are the same as in table [ tabhad ] , and the third one corresponds to the lower bound on @xmath13 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath14 being the cutoff setting the limit of validity on the effective description of branon and sm dynamics used here .",
    "this new parameter appears when dealing with branon radiative corrections since the lagrangian in ( [ lag ] ) is not renormalizable .",
    "the most relevant contribution of branon radiative correction at one loop is the modification of four - fermion interactions and fermion pair annihilation into two gauge bosons ( see table [ radcoll ] ) .",
    "in addition , electroweak precision observables and the @xmath15 anomalous magnetic moment are corrected at two loops . in @xcite",
    "has been shown that branons can explain the magnetic moment deficit of the muon found by the 821 collaboration at the brookhaven alternating gradient syncrotron @xcite and be consistent with the rest of measurements ( see figure [ rad ] ) .",
    "but it is more remarkable that the same parameter space which improve the fit of @xmath16 is able to explain the dm content of the universe .",
    "in fact , if the branon mass is of the order of the electroweak scale , or more precisely , if the branon mass is between @xmath17 gev and @xmath18 tev , branons could form the total non baryonic dm abundance observed by wmap @xcite ( see figure [ cdm ] ) .",
