    "geometrical representations in science have a long history . they give further insight in many different contexts , ranging from classical mechanics to graph theory and quantum information  @xcite .",
    "one such representation is the bloch sphere picture for spin-1/2 states , which has been widely used in the latter context .",
    "several geometrical generalizations of the bloch representation to higher spin systems have been proposed  @xcite . in his seminal paper",
    "@xcite , majorana introduced a particularly convenient way of visualizing pure spin-@xmath0 states as a set of @xmath1 points on the bloch sphere .",
    "this representation has been used in various contexts , such as in the study of spinor bose gases  @xcite or entanglement quantification and classification in multiqubit systems  @xcite .",
    "it can be used to highlight symmetries of spinor wave functions and to determine the inert states of spin systems , which are stationary for generic energy functionals  @xcite , and also to study the berry phase acquired during a cyclic evolution of a spin system  @xcite .",
    "spin-@xmath0 coherent states @xmath2 take a very simple form in the majorana representation .",
    "these states are defined as the pure states verifying @xmath3 for some unit vector @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is set to @xmath6 ) , where @xmath7 is the spin angular momentum operator associated to a spin-@xmath0 system . in the majorana representation , they are depicted by a single point ( @xmath1-fold degenerated ) on the bloch sphere , and are in this sense highly directional .",
    "for this reason , spin - coherent states are also called polarized states . by contrast , pure spin-@xmath0 states @xmath8 that depart the most from coherent states could be defined as the states which do not display any directional properties . however , for any finite @xmath0 , the moments @xmath9 of the spin components , from a certain order , depend on @xmath4 . at best , one can ask for the absence of directionality in the moments up to a given order .",
    "this motivates the following definition  @xcite : a spin-@xmath0 state @xmath8 is said to be anticoherent to order @xmath10 ( or @xmath10-anticoherent ) if @xmath11 is independent of the unit vector @xmath4 for @xmath12 .",
    "for example , @xmath6-anticoherence means that the expectation value of the spin operator @xmath13 vanishes .",
    "the problem of identifying anticoherent states can be tackled from a quantum information perspective .",
    "quantum information mainly deals with the manipulation of information stored on a set of two - level quantum systems , or qubits .",
    "it is possible to rephrase the above definition of anticoherence in the qubit language .",
    "the key element is the one - to - one mapping between the hilbert space of a single spin-@xmath0 ( of dimension @xmath14 ) and the symmetric subspace of the hilbert space associated to a system of @xmath15 qubits ( of dimension @xmath16 ) when @xmath17 . in this picture ,",
    "spin - coherent states are fully separable , whereas symmetric @xmath15-qubit @xmath10-anticoherent states are characterized by the fact that their @xmath10-qubit reduced density matrices correspond to the maximally mixed state  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath10-anticoherent states are the most entangled symmetric states , in the sense that for any @xmath18 bipartition with @xmath19 the entanglement entropy is maximal .",
    "note that the maximization of the entropy of entanglement over the _",
    "hilbert space for all possible bipartitions is not reached for symmetric states  @xcite and thus the states that realize this maximum are not @xmath10-anticoherent ; however states maximizing the entanglement entropy for @xmath20 bipartitions can be symmetric and thus @xmath6-anticoherent .",
    "these states , with maximally mixed one - qubit reductions , have been the subject of numerous research  @xcite , notably due to their importance in two - party communication tasks .",
    "similarly , the notion of non - classicality of spin states based on the glauber - sudarshan @xmath21 representation  @xcite has been translated to multiqubit symmetric states in  @xcite where it has been shown to imply entanglement .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate anticoherence from a geometrical point of view , using the majorana representation .",
    "as previously mentioned , for coherent states , majorana points all lie at the same place .",
    "by contrast , states whose majorana points are spread out as far away as possible on the sphere have been shown to be highly entangled  @xcite .",
    "for instance , it was found that states obtained by considering majorana points with a configuration identical to that of electric charges at equilibrium on a sphere maximize the geometric measure of entanglement for certain spin values .",
    "such geometric arrangements are known to display point group symmetries .",
    "we can therefore expect that arrangements of majorana points with a certain point group symmetry lead to highly entangled states . in this paper",
    ", we investigate along those lines the consequences of point group symmetries on anticoherence properties of spin states . as we will see , this allows us to construct states with high order of anticoherence .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec  [ sec : def ] , we present various characterizations of anticoherence , both from a spin and a multiqubit perspective . in particular , we derive a set of equalities that the components of a permutation - symmetric state must satisfy in order to be @xmath10-anticoherent . in sec  [ sec : pointgroup ] , we establish the consequences of the symmetries of majorana points on the components of the corresponding state and determine wich symmetries lead to anticoherence . in sec .",
    "[ sec : slocc ] , we show that any state displaying cyclic symmetry can be transformed under stochastic local operations and classical communications ( slocc ) to an anticoherent state , and establish a link between symmetries , anticoherence and slocc classes .",
    "we also identify all anticoherent states with cyclic symmetry for @xmath22 qubits . in sec .",
    "[ sec : famillies ] , we present a systematic method allowing us to find @xmath10-anticoherent states , and identify infinite families of anticoherent states with cyclic group symmetry . in sec .",
    "[ sec : allorder ] , we prove that there exists anticoherent states to all orders .",
    "in this section we formalize the correspondence between single spin-@xmath0 states and multiqubit symmetric states and transpose the definition of anticoherence given in the introduction to multiqubit symmetric states .",
    "we first describe spin-@xmath0 states , then @xmath15-qubit symmetric states and finally their one - to - one mapping .",
    "any pure spin-@xmath0 state @xmath8 can be expanded in the standard angular momentum basis @xmath23 of joint eigenstates of @xmath24 and @xmath25 as @xmath26 with @xmath27 complex coefficients such that @xmath28 .",

    "( [ eq : cohstate ] ) can be seen as the @xmath1-fold tensor product of the spin-@xmath68 coherent state  ( [ coh12 ] ) .      a @xmath10-anticoherent pure spin-@xmath0 state @xmath8 is defined by the fact that @xmath11 is independent of the unit vector @xmath4 for @xmath12 .",
    "a criterion for anticoherence has been given by bannai  @xcite for any @xmath0 in terms of correlators of @xmath69 and @xmath70 and their powers .",

    ", these conditions quickly become cumbersome .",
    "this definition of anticoherence can be naturally translated to the multiqubit setting .",
    "the mapping of the previous subsection leads to the following definition : a multiqubit symmetric state @xmath77 is @xmath10-anticoherent if @xmath78 is independent of @xmath4 for @xmath12 .",
    "a simple characterization has been given in  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath79 be the @xmath80 reduced density matrix of @xmath81 obtained by tracing over @xmath82 qubits and expressed in the dicke basis @xmath83 spanning the @xmath10-qubit symmetric subspace .",
    "note that since symmetric states are by definition invariant under permutation of the qubits , the @xmath10-qubit reduced states do not depend on the choice of the @xmath10 qubits .",
    "a state is @xmath10-anticoherent if and only if @xmath79 is proportional to the identity matrix , namely @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the @xmath86 identity matrix .",
    "this implies that @xmath10-anticoherent states maximize the entanglement entropy @xmath87 among symmetric states for any bipartition @xmath88 of the @xmath15 qubits .",
    "in this section we derive three different characterizations of anticoherence to any order @xmath10 .",
    "the first one is in terms of expectation values of convenient combinations of spin operators , the second is in terms of dicke coefficients of a state and the third is based on the multipolar expansion of the husimi function associated to a state .",

    "the husimi function is the probability of finding the state in a coherent state with a specific direction , and as the spherical harmonics @xmath161 are more and more oscillating as @xmath168 increases , directionality of a @xmath10-anticoherent state is less and less pronounced as @xmath10 increases because the husimi function is more and more uniform on the sphere .",
    "a particularly convenient way of visualizing pure spin-@xmath0 states or @xmath15-qubit symmetric states is the majorana or stellar representation  @xcite .",
    "any pure symmetric state @xmath97 can be represented by a set of @xmath51 points with angles @xmath169 on the bloch sphere .",
    "these @xmath15 points are associated with @xmath15 pure single - qubit states @xmath170 , where @xmath171 , such that @xmath172 where the sum runs over all permutations @xmath173 ( the permutation group of @xmath15 elements ) and @xmath174 is a normalization constant .",

    "the majorana representation @xcite of such a state is obtained by finding the roots of the polynomial @xmath177 this polynomial can be put in the form @xmath178 where @xmath179 are the non - zero roots of @xmath180 . applying the ( inverse ) stereographic projection from the complex plane onto the bloch sphere to the zeroes of @xmath180 through the relation @xmath181 yields @xmath182 points @xmath183 , and @xmath175 points at the south pole of the bloch sphere ( corresponding to the roots located at @xmath184 ) .",
    "adding @xmath185 points at the north pole of the bloch sphere yields the majorana representation of @xmath97 as @xmath15 points on the sphere , called majorana points .",
    "for instance , for a dicke state @xmath186 , the majorana representation is given by @xmath187 points at the north pole and @xmath188 points at the south pole of the bloch sphere .",
    "for a spin - coherent ( or symmetric separable @xmath15-qubit ) state @xmath2 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : cohstate ] ) ) , the majorana points are @xmath15 points located at @xmath37 .",
    "one of the advantages of the majorana representation is its behavior under local unitary transformations ( lu ) .",
    "symmetric lu are transformations of the form @xmath189 where @xmath190 is a unitary operator acting on a single qubit .",
    "it corresponds , up to a global phase , to a rigid rotation of the bloch sphere , and thus of the majorana points , thereby preserving the symmetries of their arrangement .      from its definition ,",
    "anticoherence of a state @xmath97 is preserved by symmetric lu . in particular",
    ", this means that it is only a feature of the relative arrangement of majorana points .",
    "we expect majorana points of an anticoherent state to be spread out over the sphere as evenly as possible . indeed , anticoherent states should be as different as possible from any directional ( polarized ) state and thus have a majorana representation as distinct as possible from @xmath15 points located at the same place .    as shown in sec .",
    "[ gencondqp ] , anticoherence is related to the vanishing of multipole moments of lower order and thus to the uniformity of the husimi function over the sphere .",
    "a natural way of constructing states with vanishing multipole moments is to consider majorana points arranged symmetrically on the sphere , as the zeroes of the husimi function are diametrically opposite to the majorana points on the bloch sphere .",
    "for example , 12 points taken at the vertices of an icosahedron yield a 12-qubit state which is 5-anticoherent .",
    "its husimi function is depicted in fig .",
    "[ dn12 ] . in the next subsection",

    "note that anticoherent states with symmetries corresponding to the exceptional point groups can also be constructed , as the example just mentioned shows .    as a consequence of these geometrical features",
    ", one may expect the barycenter of the majorana points to coincide with the center of the bloch sphere .",
    "in fact , this is not the case  @xcite .",

    "note that gauss - legendre quadrature with @xmath152 points is exact for any polynomial of degree less than or equal to @xmath438 .",
    "thus the solution we construct is in fact @xmath439-anticoherent .",
    "this means that we do not need to impose @xmath152 positions : only half of them would suffice .",
    "we can thus look for a solution with @xmath219 symmetry , i.e.  such that the @xmath399 verify @xmath440 and @xmath441 .",
    "since the equations for odd @xmath91 are automatically fulfilled , there remains a set of ( for @xmath10 even ) @xmath442 equations and @xmath442 variables @xmath443 .",
    "the systems then corresponds to a quadrature to order @xmath444 , which is exact for polynomials up to degree @xmath152 .",
    "it is thus possible to obtain @xmath219-symmetric @xmath10-anticoherent states for any @xmath10 .",
    "the proof above only states the existence of some @xmath15 sufficiently large such that a @xmath10-anticoherent state exists .",
    "we were able to find solutions using @xmath445 up to @xmath446 .",
    "more specifically , using linear programming , we looked for solutions of the form @xmath395 with @xmath441 and @xmath440 , taking @xmath399 as in for @xmath447 .",
    "we checked that for @xmath448 the conditions @xmath437 ( and thus the off - diagonal equations ) are always fulfilled ; for even @xmath10 up to @xmath446 , linear programming found an analytical solution satisfying all diagonal equations for @xmath126 .",
    "in this paper , the problem of identifying @xmath10-anticoherent states of a spin-@xmath0 system ( or equivalently @xmath1-qubit permutation - symmetric states with maximally mixed @xmath10-qubit reductions in the symmetric subspace ) has been tackled from a geometric point of view .",
    "we have provided three different characterizations of @xmath10-anticoherence .",
    "a first one is given in terms of a finite number of expectation values of spin operators and is independent of any basis , a second one in terms of dicke coefficients taking the form of a set of @xmath449 real equations and a third one in terms of spherical multipole moments of the husimi and glauber - sudarshan functions . using the majorana representation of a spin-@xmath0 state in terms of points on the sphere",
    ", we analyzed the consequence of a point - group symmetry of the majorana points on the coefficients of the quantum state , for the seven infinite families of point group symmetries .",
    "our results are summarized in table  i. a consequence is that states with @xmath212 , @xmath214 or @xmath216 symmetry are always at least @xmath6-anticoherent , in contrast to @xmath209-symmetric states which are not necessarily @xmath6-anticoherent .",
    "however , we were able to show that any slocc class containing @xmath209-symmetric states does contain a @xmath209-symmetric anticoherent state ( provided the maximal degeneracy of its majorana points is not too high ) . because a slocc class contains at most one anticoherent state ( up to lu ) , our results provide a clear link between symmetry and slocc classes .",
    "this approach allowed us to identify all anticoherent states with @xmath209 symmetry for @xmath308 qubits , and to construct families of @xmath209-symmetric states with higher order of anticoherence .",
    "we discussed a method based on linear programming allowing us to obtain @xmath15-qubit @xmath209-symmetric @xmath10-anticoherent states with @xmath249 , when they exist .",
    "finally we constructed explicitly @xmath10-anticoherent states with arbitrary order @xmath10 , proving that such states exist at all order .",
    "note that our results about anticoherence of spin states are of interest in the context of quantum information as the states we identified are maximally entanglement symmetric states with respect to the entanglement entropy .",
