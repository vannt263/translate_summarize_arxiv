    "it is well known that one of the major obstacles for practical manipulation of quantum information is the effect of decoherence due to coupling to environment .",
    "so how to protect quantum information from these effects become a major challenge .",
    "a number of strategies have been proposed to fight decoherence , such as quantum error correction @xcite , decoherence - free subspace ( dfs ) @xcite , dynamical decoupling ( dd ) @xcite , engineering reservoir @xcite , _ etc_. the general framework for dfs was introduced by zanardi _",
    "@xcite in a spin - boson model undergoing both dephasing and dissipation . in the presence of environment , dfs is a set of all states which are immune to decoherence processes induced by interaction with bath .",
    "these are groups of states that have robust symmetry properties .",
    "the quantum information can be encoded in dfs in order to increase reliability of quantum information processing @xcite . on the other hand carvalho _",
    "et al . _ have presented a proposal for protecting states of a trapped ion against decoherence , based on engineering of pointer states @xcite . by controlling the reservior ,",
    "they have applied an indirect control on the protected states , and have shown how to protect squeezed states , approximate phase eigenstates , and superpositions of coherent states . recently ,",
    "have shown how to protect a nonstationary superposition states of a two - level ( tl ) ion . working with an ion trapped inside a dissipative cavity",

    "[ 15,16 ] only considered one particle system , then a natural question arises , how about multi - particle system ? can we use this engineering reservoir scheme to protect entanglement ? in this paper we will answer these questions .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a scheme , which generalizes the engineering reservoir scheme presented for a single ion in ref .",
    "@xcite , for protecting given entangled states of two tl ions by building a class of periodic nonadiabatic coherent evolution .",
    "we consider a system consisting of two tl ions coupled resonantly to a dissipative cavity and simultaneously driven by classical fields . for this system , we can obtain a time - independent master equation by the techniques of engineering reservoir .",
    "then we can show that the given initial entangled state can be projected into a dfs , and in particular , modifications of the parameters of the reservoir may result in a controlled time evolution of the protected subspace as a whole . in this way",
    "the protected entangled state lying in this subspace evolves periodically .",
    "finally , we calculate the geometric phase of the whole system and the subsystems under the nonadiabatic coherent evolution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the first and second terms of the hamiltonian represent the classical field driving and the coupling between the ions and the cavity respectively .",
    "we suppose that the cavity mode is heavily damped with decay rate @xmath22 and the ions spontaneously decay with rates @xmath23 .",
    "then the master equation describing the system is given by @xmath24 + \\kappa d\\left [ { a } \\right]\\rho    + \\sum_i\\gamma^i d\\left [ { \\sigma^i_{ge } } \\right]\\rho,\\ ] ] where the lindblad decoherence superoperator @xmath25\\rho = a\\rho a^\\dag - a^\\dag a\\rho /2 - \\rho a^\\dag a/2 $ ] and @xmath26\\rho   = \\sigma^i_{ge } \\rho \\sigma^{i}_{eg } - \\sigma^{i}_{eg } \\sigma^i_{ge}\\rho /2 - \\rho \\sigma^{i}_{eg } \\sigma^i_{ge}/2 $ ] describe cavity and ionic decays respectively .",

    ", the cavity mode can be adiabatically eliminated and we can obtain a time - independent master equation just for the ions @xcite    @xmath40\\rho^\\prime+\\sum_i\\gamma^i d\\left [ { \\sigma^{\\prime}}^{i } \\right]\\rho^\\prime,\\ ] ]    where @xmath41 is the coupling strength of the engineered reservoir .",
    "furthermore , under the assumption that @xmath42 is much larger than the spontaneous emission rate @xmath43 of the ions , i.e. , @xmath44 , eq .",

    "( 7 ) , the dfs is composed of all the eigenstates of the operator @xmath46 with zero eigenvalue and it is easy to prove that it is spanned by the following orthonormal states : the product state @xmath47 and the maximal entangled state @xmath48 .",
    "it is easy to see that the state @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the equilibrium state of the master equation ( 7 ) .",
    "if the two ions are initially prepared in these states , they would remain the same .",
    "however if the ions starts outside this subspace , the situation gets more complicated . because eq .",
    "( 7 ) is symmetric with respect to exchange of the two ions , one could analyze the system in terms of the antisymmetric @xmath51 and symmetric @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 subspaces @xcite .",

    "it must be noted that although many methods have been proposed to protect the entanglement from dissipation , our approach is different .",
    "most of the schemes to protect entanglement is static , but ours is dynamic .",
    "more specifically the protected state goes through a cyclic nonadiabatic coherent evolution , but the degree of entanglement does not evolves and remains the same . in this way",
    "we can change one entangled state into another entangled state with the same degree of entanglement against dissipation .",
    "from above discussion , we can see that the protected two - ion state ( 9 ) is dynamic rather than static. if @xmath66=@xmath71 ( where @xmath72 is an integer and @xmath73 ) , the system will undergo a cyclic coherent evolution .",
    "after a cyclic evolution , the system returns to its original state but may acquire a geometric phase . to compute the geometric phase we use the definition given in ref .",

    "next we calculate the geometric phase of the subsystems and to study the relation between the geometric phase of the subsystems and the entanglement degree",
    ". generally speaking , the state of the subsystem is no longer a pure one , so we adopt the definition of geometric phase for mixed states under bilocal unitary evolution @xcite .",

    "in this paper , we have considered two tl ions in a heavily damped cavity . using engineering reservoir scheme ,",
    "we have obtained a time - independent master equation , and then have found a dfs for this master equation , which can be nonadiabatically controlled by the system - reservoir parameters .",
    "we have achieved a class of decoherence - free cyclic evolution of the entangled state .",
