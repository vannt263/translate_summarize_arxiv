    "the diffusion efficiency of molecules between these two phases is poorly constrained , limiting our understanding for how the ice morphology evolves when the grains are heated during star formation .",

    "the experimental results are in some tension with recent simulations of co diffusion on amorphous h@xmath0o , where @xcite found that there are two populations of co binding sites , one described as a strong - binding nanopore site and the other as a weaker surface site , with diffusion barriers of 80 mev and 30 mev , respectively .",
    "experiments and simulations may be reconcilable if diffusion kinetics in h@xmath0o ice mainly depends on the barrier height of the weakest bound co. to isolate the low - barrier diffusion from diffusion between more strongly bound sites , we study the diffusion kinetics of co in h@xmath0o ice at very low temperatures , where co in strongly bound sites will be completely immobile .",
    "the study of low - temperature diffusion is facilitated by our experimental strategy focusing on co diffusion _ into _ h@xmath0o ice rather than _ out of _ the ice .",

    "these changes are most pronounced on the blue wing of the h@xmath0o stretching band , where oh - bonds that are not interacting with the hydrogen bonding network in the bulk of the water ice absorb ( fig .",
    "[ dangleohod]a ) . in pure h@xmath0o ice , these dangling oh bonds trace pore surface area , with a double peak ir profile at 3719 and 3697  @xmath10 .",
    "h@xmath0o molecules that interact with co present a similar feature slightly shifted to the red @xcite , at 3639  @xmath10 .",
    "there are corresponding dangling od bands in pure and mixed d@xmath0o ices , with the double pure features at 2750 and 2731  @xmath10 , and the mixed feature at 2692  @xmath10 .",
    "figure [ dangleohod]a and b shows that during the diffusion experiments there is a clear loss of the h@xmath0o 3719 and 3697  @xmath10 features and a simultaneous growth of the 3639  @xmath10 band .",
    "figure [ dangleohod]d shows the corresponding time series , which displays a similar profile to the mixing time series based on co spectroscopy , but with a lower signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this increasing exchange of h@xmath0o pore spectral features with co - h@xmath0o spectral features indicates that co diffuses into the h@xmath0o ice through pores .    to constrain the diffusion mechanism further we run several experiments with a d@xmath0o layer on top of the h@xmath0o layer and simultaneously monitored the changes in the h@xmath0o and d@xmath0o dangling oh and od bands .",
    "figure [ dangleohod]d and e shows that when the bottom co layer is thin ( 14  ml ) , no co diffusion into the top d@xmath0o layer is observed . as the co ice layer thickness is increased , co diffusion into the d@xmath0o layer is observed , but always at a lower level compare to the intermediary h@xmath0o layer .",
    "the initial co mixing rate also appears lower for d@xmath0o compared to h@xmath0o as would be expected since co has to travel through h@xmath0o before entering into the d@xmath0o ice .",
    "the low snr in these experiments as well as an unknown amount of d / h exchange reactions between d@xmath0o and h@xmath0o prohibits an independent measure of the diffusion rate based on these experiments .",
    "figure [ d2olayerdelay ] shows , however , that the data qualitatively compares well with the fickian model solutions for these experiments , based on the fit to the co spectral time progression modeling n  4.2.2 .",
    "co diffusion into a h@xmath0o matrix as described by our solution to fick s diffusion law thus seems to be a good model of the h@xmath0o / co ice mixing process .",
    "the presented experiments aimed at characterizing co ( surface ) diffusion in h@xmath0o - rich ices by measuring the mixing of initially layered ices and extracting the diffusion coefficient from the data .",
    "this approach should work as long as the observed ice mixing is dominated by co diffusion into the h@xmath0o ice matrix .",
    "the general agreement between data and models based on fick s diffusion law supports that co diffusion indeed drives the mixing process . without additional information",
    "the co diffusion could be due either bulk diffusion though e.g. , molecular swapping @xcite , or hopping on the surfaces of nano- and micropores @xcite . both could _ a priori _ result in the observed diffusion profiles .",
    "it is furthermore not necessary that the same diffusion process dominates at all times , since mixing of co ( or other molecules ) into the ice could change both the hopping and swapping barriers .",
    "there are several experimental and theoretical considerations that suggest that diffusion of co in our ice systems is dominated by pore diffusion , however .",
    "first , the derived diffusion barrier is very low ( @xmath2170  k ) .",
    "second , the diffusion rate increases by an order of magnitude at 15  k when the ice porosity is increased .",
    "this may be partially due to a reduction in the diffusion barrier ( see below ) , but a more straightforward explanation is that most of the diffusion rate increase is due to an increase in pore area , and that the diffusion process in these experiments proceeds similarly to the low - porosity ice experiments . finally and perhaps most importantly , the h@xmath0o ice spectroscopy in these experiments reveals that as the co diffuses into the h@xmath0o ice , the dangling oh bonds is replaced by spectroscopic features assigned to dangling oh - co interactions , which is expected if the pore walls become increasingly covered by co.    simulations provide additional clues on the co - h@xmath0o interactions in these pores . in particular , simulations by @xcite",
    "show that water ice surfaces contain multiple sites that interact strongly or weakly with co. these interactions should manifest themselves in different co spectral features in co : h@xmath0o ice mixtures , but exact identifications are still lacking . at our low experimental temperatures , co",
    "that becomes bound in a strongly interacting site is expected to be become bound and the diffusion kinetics should be regulated by the number density and the diffusion barrier of the weakly interacting sites .",
    "as the strongly bound sites fill up , the co can diffuse further into the ice before it gets trapped , consistent with the diffusion behavior in the thick d@xmath0o / h@xmath0o experiments .",
    "spectroscopically , we measure mixing by the growth of co interacting with dangling oh , which probably correspond to co that is trapped in a strongly bound site , or nanopore . in this scenario",
    "the derived diffusion coefficient thus describes the rate at which a molecule diffuses through the ice along weakly bound sites , while the remaining parameters in the diffusion equation characterizes the availability of empty nanopores / strongly bound sites to diffuse into . in this scenario ,",
    "the diffusion length scale of a co molecule depend on the number of weakly bound sites before a strongly bound site is encountered .",
    "the traveled distance should thus increase as more sites become occupied by co molecules .",
    "the maximum diffusion length is limited by the amount of available co. this is confirmed by the isotopically layered thick ice experiments where it is clear that is is shown that if the co under layer is thin , no co will make it all the way through the h@xmath0o ice into the d@xmath0o ice .",
    "figure [ schematic ] shows a schematic of the proposed mixing mechanism of the co and h@xmath0o ices through co diffusion into the h@xmath0o ice via micropores and nanopores .",
    "the experiments further provide evidence for that the already low co diffusion barrier of @xmath1160  k is further reduced if the ice porosity is increased and if co@xmath0 is mixed into the h@xmath0o ice .",
    "the simplest explanation for the low diffusion barrier in the high - porosity experiments is that co has access to a higher number of low - barrier diffusion pathways .",
    "it may also be due to a higher density of ` large ' micropores @xcite , i.e. , larger than a few molecules across , which could enable co molecules to  piggy - back \" on top of other co molecules coating the micropore walls .",
    "in other words , the @xmath1100  k barriers derived in the high - porosity ice experiments may reflect the co - co diffusion barrier .",
    "more experiments are required to distinguish between these scenarios , and indeed to ensure that the extracted small barrier is real .",
    "the co@xmath0:h@xmath0o ice mixture experiments both result in a lower barrier and in an overall diffusion rate .",
    "this suggests that the addition co@xmath0 both changes the overall binding environment , adding lower binding sites compared to pure h@xmath0o ice , and reduces the number of pores that co can diffuse into .",
    "based on the presented experiments and analysis , the barrier for co to diffuse into h@xmath0o ice along pore walls is @xmath2170  k , with a best fit value of @xmath1158  k for a pure , low - porosity ice .",
    "this compares well , within the uncertainties , with results from previous studies on co diffusion in amorphous h@xmath0o ice using three different approaches : segregation of co from co : h@xmath0o ice mixtures @xcite , co desorption from co : h@xmath0o ice mixtures @xcite , and co desorption from layered h@xmath0o / co ices @xcite .",
    "summarized in table [ prevres ] , the derived co diffusion barriers in these studies all range between 120 and 300  k ( 1030 mev ) .",
    "considering the good agreement between these very different experiments ( including large differences in vacuum and deposition conditions , ice thicknesses and ice morphology ) , it appears robust that there are co diffusion barriers that are significantly lower than currently assumed in astrochemical models for either surface or bulk diffusion .",

    "furthermore , unless the h@xmath0o is impure , resulting in some of the strongly bound sites being occupied by other volatiles , the diffusion length scale with this low barrier may not be very long .",
    "most astrophysical ices may fall into this category based on the formation process of the h@xmath0o ice in the interstellar medium @xcite and its observed intimate mixing with other volatiles @xcite .",
    "the derived barrier thus provides an important constraint on co surface diffusion ; the h@xmath0o - co diffusion barrier of @xmath1160  k is a factor of 23 lower than what is currently assumed in astrochemical models for surface diffusion .",
    "this discrepancy implies that diffusion of co , and perhaps many other species , is possible at much lower temperatures than currently assumed .",
    "the kinetics of co diffusion into water ice at low temperatures ( below the co desorption temperature ) were examined using initially layered ices . based on the diffusion dependencies on temperature , ice thickness , porosity , and composition and the subsequent analysis",
    "we conclude that :    1 .",
    "co is mobile in low - porosity amorphous h@xmath0o ice at 1523  k , with a diffusion length scale that depends on the number of available strongly bound sites where co can become trapped .",
    "2 .   the measured co diffusion into the h@xmath0o ice matrix is a pore - mediated process and characterizes co diffusion on h@xmath0o surfaces , rather than bulk diffusion .",
    "the observed dependence of the co diffusion on ice temperature implies that the lowest co diffusion barrier into the pores of amorphous h@xmath0o ice is 160  k .",
    "4 .   this barrier is lower in more porous ices and when adding co@xmath0 is added to the h@xmath0o matrix .",
