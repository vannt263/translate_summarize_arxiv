    "open clusters provide unique opportunities in astrophysics .",
    "stars in open clusters are believed to be formed from the same cloud of gas at roughly the same time .",
    "the fewer free parameters available to model cluster stars make them interesting targets to analyze as a uniform ensemble , especially for asteroseismic studies .",
    "asteroseismology is an elegant tool based on the simple principle that the frequency of a standing acoustic wave inside a star depends on the sound speed , which in turn depends on the physical properties of the interior .",
    "this technique applied to the sun ( helioseismology ) has provided extremely detailed knowledge about the physics that governs the solar interior , ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "all cool stars are expected to exhibit solar - like oscillations of standing acoustic waves  called p modes  that are stochastically driven by surface convection . using asteroseismology to probe the interiors of cool stars in clusters , therefore ,",
    "holds promise of rewarding scientific return @xcite .",
    "this potential has resulted in several attempts to detect solar - like oscillations in clusters using time - series photometry .",
    "these attempts were often aimed at red giants , since their oscillation amplitudes are expected to be larger than those of main - sequence or subgiant stars due to more vigorous surface convection . despite these attempts ,",
    "only marginal detections have been attained so far , limited either by the length of the time series usually achievable through observations with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "@xcite or by the difficulty in attaining high precision from ground - based campaigns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this letter",
    "we report clear detections of solar - like oscillations in red - giant stars in the open cluster ngc  6819 using photometry from nasa s _ kepler mission _ @xcite . this cluster , one of four in the _ kepler _ field , is about 2.5  gyr old .",
    "it is at a distance of 2.3  kpc , and has a metallicity of [ fe / h ]  @xmath2 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "*  and references herein ) .",
    "the data were obtained between 2009 may 12 and june 14 , i.e. , the first 34 days of continuous science observations by _ kepler _ ( q1 phase ) .",
    "the spacecraft s long - cadence mode ( @xmath3minutes ) used in this investigation provided a total of 1639 data points in the time series of each observed star .",
    "for this letter we selected 47 stars in the field of the open cluster ngc  6819 with membership probability @xmath4% from radial velocity measurements @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] shows the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the cluster with the selected stars indicated by green symbols .",
    "the eleven annotated stars form a representative subset , which we will use to illustrate our analyses in sections  [ extract ] and  [ membership ] .",
    "we selected the stars in this subset to cover the same brightness range as our full sample , while giving high weight to stars that appear to be photometric non - members ( i.e. , stars located far from the isochrone in the cmd ) .",
    "data for each target were checked carefully to ensure that the time - series photometry was not contaminated significantly by other stars in the field , which could otherwise complicate the interpretation of the oscillation signal .",
    "fourteen data points affected by the momentum dumping of the spacecraft were removed from the time series of each star .",
    "in addition , we removed points that showed a point - to - point deviation greater than @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the local rms of the point - to - point scatter within a 24 hour window .",
    "this process removed on average one data - point per time series .",
    "finally , we removed a linear trend from each time series and then calculated the discrete fourier transform .",
    "the fourier spectra at high frequency have mean levels below 5 parts per million ( ppm ) in amplitude , allowing us to search for low - amplitude solar - like oscillations .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] shows the fourier spectra ( in power ) of 9 stars from our subset . these range from the lower red - giant branch to the tip of the branch ( see figure  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "the stars are sorted by apparent magnitude , which for a cluster is indicative of luminosity , with brightest at the top .",
    "note that the red giants in ngc  6819 are significantly fainter ( @xmath7 ) than the sample of _ kepler _ field red giants ( @xmath8 ) studied by @xcite . nevertheless , it is clear from figure  [ f2 ] that we can detect oscillations for stars that span about two orders of magnitude in luminosity along the cluster sequence .",
    "we used four different pipelines @xcite to extract the average frequency separation between modes of the same degree ( the so - called large frequency separation , @xmath0 ) .",
    "we have also obtained the frequency of maximum oscillation power , @xmath9 , and the oscillation amplitude .",
    "the measured values of @xmath0  are indicated by vertical dotted lines in figure  [ f2 ] centered on the highest oscillation peaks near @xmath9 . while the stars in figure  [ f2 ] , particularly in the lower panels , show the regular series of peaks expected for solar - like oscillations , the limited length of the time - series data does not allow such structure to be clearly resolved for the most luminous stars in our sample",
    " those with @xmath9  @xmath10@xmath11hz .",
    "we do , however , see humps of excess power in the fourier spectra ( see figure  [ f2 ] star no . 2 and 8) with @xmath9  and amplitude in mutual agreement with oscillations . with longer time series we expect more firm results for these high - luminosity giants .",
    "it is immediately clear from figure  [ f2 ] that not all stars follow the expected trend of increasing @xmath9  with decreasing apparent magnitude , suggesting that some of the stars might be intrinsically brighter or fainter than expected .",
    "since oscillations in a star only depend on the physical properties of the star , we can use asteroseismology to judge whether or not a star is likely to be a cluster member independently of its distance and of interstellar absorption and reddening . for cool stars , @xmath9  scales with the acoustic cut - off frequency , and it is well established that we can estimate @xmath9  by scaling from the solar value @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13hz .",
    "the accuracy of such estimates is good to within 5% @xcite assuming we have good estimates of the stellar parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .    in the following",
    "we assume the idealistic scenario where all cluster members follow standard stellar evolution described by the isochrone .",
    "stellar mass along the red giant branch of the cluster isochrone varies by less than 1% .",
    "the variation is less than 5% even if we also consider the asymptotic giant branch . for simplicity",
    ", we therefore adopt a mass of @xmath17 for all stars , which is representative for the isochrone from @xcite ( figure  [ f1 ] ) and a similar isochrone by @xcite . neglecting binarity ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) , we derive the luminosity of each star in our subset from its @xmath18-band apparent magnitude , adopting reddening and distance modulus of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively ( obtained from simple isochrone fitting , see @xcite ) .",
    "we used the calibration of @xcite to convert the stellar @xmath21 color to @xmath16 .",
    "bolometric corrections were also taken from @xcite .",
    "the derived quantities were then used to estimate @xmath9  for each star ( eq .  [ numaxsc ] ) , and compared with the observed value ( see figure  [ f3 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ f3 ] shows four obvious outliers ( no . 1 , 3 , 8 and 11 ) , three of which are also outliers in the cmd ( no . 1 , 3 , and 11 ) .",
    "for the rest of the stars we see good agreement between the expected and observed value , indicating that the uncertainty on the @xmath9  estimates are relatively small .",
    "since the variations in mass and effective temperature among the cluster giant stars are small , deviations from the dotted line must be caused by an incorrect estimate of the luminosity .",
    "this implies that the luminosities of stars falling significantly above or below the line have been over- or underestimated , respectively .",
    "the simplest interpretation is that these outliers are fore- or background stars , and hence not members of the cluster . to explain the differences between the observed and expected value of @xmath9   would require the deviant stars to have @xmath18 errors of more than 1 magnitude , and in some cases @xmath22 errors of about 0.2 magnitude if they were cluster members .",
    "binarity may explain deviations above the dotted line , but only by up to a factor of two in @xmath15 ( and hence , in the ratio of the observed to expected @xmath9 ) .",
    "the deviation of only one star ( no.1 ) could potentially be explained this way .",
    "however , that would be in disagreement with its single - star classification from multi - epoch radial velocity measurements , assuming it is not a binary viewed pole - on ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) . hence , under the assumption of a standard stellar evolution , the most likely explanation for all four outliers in figure  [ f3 ] is therefore that these stars are not cluster members .",
    "this conclusion is , however , in disagreement with their high membership probability from measurements of radial velocity @xcite and proper motion @xcite ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "another interesting possibility is that the anomalous pulsation properties might be explained by more exotic stellar evolution scenarios than is generally anticipated for open - cluster stars .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ f2 ] that the amplitudes of the oscillations increase with luminosity for the seismically determined cluster members .",
    "based on calculations by @xcite , @xcite have suggested that the photometric oscillation amplitude of p modes scale as @xmath23@xmath16@xmath24 , with @xmath25 ( the velocity amplitudes , meanwhile , would scale as @xmath26 ) .",
    "this was revised by @xcite to @xmath27 based on models of main sequence stars .",
    "taking advantage of the fewer free parameters within this ensemble of stars , our observations allow us to make some progress towards extrapolating this scaling to red giants and determining the value of @xmath28 .    in figure  [ f4 ]",
    "we introduce a new type of diagram that is similar to a cmd , but with magnitude replaced by an asteroseismic parameter  in this case , the measured oscillation amplitude .",
    "amplitudes were estimated for all stars in our sample ( except for the four outliers ) using methods similar to that of @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which assume that the relative power between radial and non - radial modes is the same as in the sun .",
    "this diagram confirms the relationship between amplitude and luminosity . despite a large scatter , which is not surprising from this relatively short time series ,",
    "we see that @xmath27 provides a much better match than @xmath29 .",
    "once verified with more data , this relation will allow the use of the measured amplitude as an additional asteroseismic diagnostic for testing cluster membership and for isochrone fitting in general .",
    "we note that the other clusters observed by _ kepler _ have different metallicities than ngc  6819 , which will allow future investigation on the metallicity dependence of the oscillation amplitudes .",
    "we expect to obtain less scatter in the asteroseismic measurements when longer time series become available .",
    "that will enable us to expand classical isochrone fitting techniques to include diagrams like this , where amplitude could also be replaced by @xmath9  or @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we should be able to determine the absolute radii aided by @xmath0  of the red giant branch stars , which would be an important calibrator for theoretical isochrones .",
    "additionally , the distributions of the asteroseismic parameters  such as @xmath9   can potentially be used to test stellar population synthesis models @xcite . applying this approach to clusters",
    "could lead to further progress in understanding of physical processes such as mass loss during the red - giant phase ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "note that a few clear outliers are indicative of non - membership or exotic stellar evolution , as a result of factors such as stellar collisions or heavy mass loss , while a general deviation from the theoretical predictions by a large group of stars would suggest that the standard theory may need revision .",
    "finally , we note that ngc  6819 and another _ kepler _ cluster , ngc  6791 , contain detached eclipsing binaries @xcite . for these stars masses and radii can be determined independently @xcite , which will further strengthen results of asteroseismic analyses .",
    "photometric data of red giants in ngc  6819 obtained by nasa s _ kepler mission _ have enabled us to make the first clear detection of solar - like oscillations in cluster stars .",
    "the general properties of the oscillations ( @xmath0 , @xmath9 , and amplitudes ) agree well with results of field red giants made by _ kepler _",
    "@xcite and corot @xcite .",
    "we find that the oscillation amplitudes of the observed stars scale as @xmath30@xmath16@xmath24 , suggesting that previous attempts to detect oscillations in clusters from ground were at the limit of detection .",
    "we find that the oscillation properties provide additional tests for cluster membership , allowing us to identify four stars that are either non - members or exotic stars .",
    "all four stars have membership probability higher than 80% from radial - velocity measurements , but three of them appear to be photometric non - members .",
    "we further point out that deviations from the theoretical predictions of the asteroseismic parameters among a large sample of cluster stars have the potential of being used as additional constraints in the isochrone fitting process , which can lead to improved stellar models .",
    "our results , based on limited data of about one month , highlight the unique potential of asteroseismology on the brightest stars in the stellar clusters observed by _",
    "kepler_. with longer series sampled at the spacecraft s short cadence ( @xmath31 1 minute ) , we expect to detect oscillations in the subgiants and turn - off stars , as well as in the blue stragglers in this cluster .",
    "funding for this discovery mission is provided by nasa s science mission directorate .",
