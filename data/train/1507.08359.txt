    "in this paper , we consider structure - preserving numerical integration of the benjamin - type equations .",
    "the benjamin equation is represented as @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 are real parameters , the subscript @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 , respectively ) denotes the differentiation with respect to the time variable @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) . the operator @xmath7 is defined as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the hilbert transform @xmath10 this equation is often considered on the torus @xmath11 , i.e. under the periodic boundary condition of length @xmath12 . in this case",
    "the hilbert transform is defined by @xmath13 or equivalently through its fourier transform @xmath14 the benjamin equation can formally be seen as a generalization of the kdv equation ( @xmath15 ) and the benjamin ",
    "ono equation ( @xmath16 )  @xcite .",
    "the benjamin equation was first introduced in  @xcite as a governing equation which models unidirectional propagation of long internal waves of small amplitude at an interface of two incompressible fluids of different density .",
    "global well - posedness is proved for data in both @xmath17 and @xmath18  @xcite . since the kdv and benjamin ",
    "ono equations possess solitary wave solutions of the form @xmath19 , whether the benjamin equation also has solitary waves has been a major subject .",
    "this topic was initially raised by benjamin  @xcite , and extensively studied after that ( see , for example , @xcite ) . nevertheless , in contrast to the kdv and benjamin ",
    "ono equations , explicit formulae are not known . since then",
    ", numerical studies have been done to approximate the solitary waves  @xcite .",
    "the benjamin equation has three invariants  @xcite @xmath20 they are also constant when the equation is considered on the torus @xmath11 .",
    "only the third invariant @xmath21 determines a hamiltonian structure @xmath22 .    for pdes with geometric structures",
    ", it is widely accepted that structure - preserving numerical methods often yield better numerical solutions than general - purpose methods , especially over a long period of time , and this topic has attracting much attention in the last two decades ( see e.g.  @xcite for the temporal discretization and  @xcite for the spatial discretization ) . for the kdv equation , several structure - preserving methods have been proposed ; for example , invariants - preserving methods  @xcite , and symplectic and multi - symplectic methods  @xcite . on the other hand , for the benjamin and benjamin ",
    "ono equations , only few structure - preserving methods have been known , because the study on geometry of the benjamin - type equations are less developed , and the non - local operator ( @xmath9 or @xmath7 ) needs to be discretized carefully .",
    "we are only aware of a single exception : an @xmath23-preserving method for the benjamin ",
    "ono equation , which was proposed by thome ",
    "vasudeva murthy  @xcite .    based on the above observation , in this paper we aim at proposing some new structure - preserving integrators for the benjamin - type equations .",
    "we like to note here that some invariant - preserving discretizations are rather obvious in the following sense .",
    "first , thome  vasudeva murthy s approach mentioned above can be readily applied to the benjamin equation .",
    "second , it is straightforward to derive an @xmath21-preserving integrator based on the hamiltonian structure mentioned above by utilizing the discrete variational derivative method  @xcite ( provided an appropriate discretization of the hilbert transform , such as the one in thome  vasudeva murthy , or in the present paper ) .",
    "thus in the present paper we like to try a different approach , which is in some sense on top of the literature of the so - called multi - symplectic method . to this end , we first have to find a multi - symplectic formulation of the benjamin type equations .",
    "if it is found , it should tell us the local behavior of the benjamin type equations ; unfortunately , however , it seems the hilbert transform ( which is a non - local operator ) prohibits that , at least in a standard manner , and we have to introduce some new ideas .    in this paper",
    ", we do this by extending the concept of the multi - symplecticity so that it can fit into the benjamin - type equations",
    ". then we discretize the equations by the euler box and preissmann box schemes . here arises another difficulty ",
    "the preissmann box scheme is generally stabler than the euler box scheme , and thus is more preferable ; but as its price it has a disadvantage that it is not uniquely solvable unless the number of the spatial grid points is odd ( this is caused by an averaging operator in front of the unknown variable ) .",
    "this is troublesome in the present context , since in the literature , the discretization of the hilbert transform has been considered only with even number of grid points . in this study , we give a discretization of the hilbert transform also for the odd case , and more importantly , give its theoretical justification .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in",
    ", we briefly review the concept of multi - symplecticity and some discretization methods . in",
    ", we propose new integrators for the benjamin - type equations .",
    "we extend the concept of the multi - symplecticity in , discuss the discretization of the hilbert transform and the operator @xmath7 in , and derive integrators in first@refsec33,sec34,@. in , some numerical results are provided . finally , concluding remarks are given in .    the following notation is used in this paper . for the sake of numerical computation",
    ", we impose the periodic boundary condition .",
    "the domain @xmath24 $ ] is discretized by uniform meshes with the space mesh size @xmath25 .",
    "numerical solutions are denoted by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the time mesh size .",
    "when we write only the subscript or superscript , it means the associated semi - discretization .",
    "we use the abbreviation @xmath28 ( a similar abbreviation is also used for the time index ) . in order to treat the periodic boundary condition",
    ", we restrict our consideration to an infinite long vector @xmath29 with the property @xmath30 , and denote the space to which such periodic vectors belong by @xmath31 ( in this paper , a bold type always belongs to @xmath31 ) .",
    "we use the standard difference operators that approximate @xmath32 and @xmath33 : @xmath34",
    "in this section , we briefly review the concept of multi - symplecticity and some discretization methods . for more details on this topic",
    ", we refer , for example , to the early references  @xcite .",
    "a partial differential equation @xmath35 is said to be multi - symplectic if it can be written as a system of first - order equations @xmath36 with @xmath37 a vector of state variables , in which the original variable @xmath38 is included as one of its components .",
    "the constant matrices @xmath39 are skew - symmetric , and @xmath40 is a smooth function depending on @xmath41 .",
    "a key property of the multi - symplecticity is that there is a multi - symplectic conservation law @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are differential two - forms defined by @xmath45 a multi - symplectic pde also has local conservation laws @xmath46 where @xmath47 integrating these local conservation laws over the spatial domain , under appropriate boundary conditions and appropriate assumptions of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , leads to the global conservation laws @xmath50 these quantities are called energy and momentum , respectively .      a numerical scheme is called multi - symplectic , if it satisfies a discrete version of the multi - symplectic conservation law . as typical multi - symplectic schemes , we give two well - known examples : the euler box scheme and the preissmann box scheme .",
    "let us introduce a splitting of two matrices @xmath51 and @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath53 and @xmath54 so that @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the so called euler box scheme reads @xmath57 although the above splitting is not unique , if we choose @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the scheme is simplified to @xmath60 hereafter , we consider this special case just for simplicity .",
    "the euler box scheme satisfies the discrete multi - symplectic conservation law @xmath61 where @xmath62    the preissmann box scheme reads @xmath63 the preissmann box scheme satisfies the discrete multi - symplectic conservation law @xmath64 where @xmath65 the central idea of the preissmann box scheme is to apply the midpoint rule to the both time and space variables , but the preissmann box scheme differs from the standard midpoint rule in that the domain should be divided with odd grid points , i.e. @xmath66 is odd , for the preissmann box scheme to ensure the uniqueness of numerical solutions .    in general",
    ", multi - symplectic integrators do not inherit the local conservation laws , and the global conservation laws , except for the special cases @xmath67 is quadratic  @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that backward error analysis shows that these global invariants are nearly preserved without any drift  @xcite : for the euler box and preissmann box schemes , errors in energy and momentum are bounded with the order @xmath68 independently of time .",
    "we also note that a semi - discrete scheme may inherit one of the global invariants : for example , if we apply the preissmann box scheme to only the spatial variable , the corresponding semi - discrete scheme @xmath69 inherits the local and global energy conservation laws  @xcite .",
    "since the multi - symplecticity tells us both local and global properties of the pdes , ideally we hope to find a multi - symplectic formulation for the benjamin - type equations .",
    "this seems , however , rather demanding , at least to the present authors , due to the non - local operators ( @xmath9 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "note that the presence of non - local operators does not always deny the existence of a multi - symplectic structure .",
    "indeed , some non - local pdes such as the camassa  holm and hunter  saxton equations possess multi - symplectic structures  @xcite .",
    "the key to the success there is that the non - local operators appear only as some inverse of standard differential operators , and can be formally eliminated by multiplying the associated operators ; for example , the camassa ",
    "holm equation involves @xmath70 . on the other hand ,",
    "since the non - locality of the benjamin equation is due to the hilbert transform , whose inverse is also non - local and thus difficult to treat , it is unlikely that there exists a multi - symplectic formulation for the benjamin equation .",
    "the above difficulty motivates us to extend the multi - symplectic formulation so that the extended formulation can fit into the benjamin equation . in the formulation",
    ", @xmath71 denotes a standard gradient in the finite dimensional setting .",
    "we change this gradient with the functional derivative in the infinite dimensional setting , and then consider the formulation @xmath72 where the right hand side denotes the functional derivative of the functional @xmath73 with respect to @xmath41 .",
    "this idea is motivated by @xcite , where a similar approach has been already mentioned .",
    "more rigorously , in the finite dimensional setting , for @xmath74 , the gradient @xmath75 in @xmath76 is defined by @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the gteaux derivative and @xmath79 is the inner product in @xmath76 . in the infinite dimensional setting , for @xmath80 , the gradient , i.e. functional derivative , @xmath81 in @xmath82 is defined by @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes the gteaux derivative and @xmath79 is the inner product in @xmath82 .",
    "for example , if @xmath85 the simple calculation @xmath86 shows that @xmath87    the benjamin equation can be written as the formulation with @xmath88^\\top$ ] , @xmath89 and @xmath90 because of the symmetry of the operator @xmath7 , the functional derivative is calculated to be @xmath91 and thus the formulation can be written in the componentwise fashion @xmath92    below , we discuss local and global properties of the benjamin equation based on the formulation .",
    "let us first consider the multi - symplectic conservation law .",
    "the variational equation associated with is @xmath93 here , the right hand side is calculated to be @xmath94 since @xmath95 we have @xmath96 here @xmath97 does not vanish , and thus the multi - symplectic conservation law does not hold for the benjamin equation .",
    "however , integrating over the spatial domain under the periodic boundary condition , we obtain the global property @xmath98    next we consider the local conservation laws . taking the inner product of with @xmath99 , we obtain @xmath100 because of the skew - symmetry of @xmath51 . noticing that @xmath101 and @xmath102 we have @xmath103 therefore",
    ", the local conservation law does not hold .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath104 and thus the local conservation law is not satisfied .",
    "although the local conservation laws do not hold , integrating and over the spacial domain under the periodic boundary condition immediately leads to the global conservation laws @xmath105 here , the symmetry of the operator @xmath7 @xmath106 is used .",
    "choosing @xmath16 leads to the formulation for the benjamin ",
    "ono equation : @xmath107 similarly , choosing @xmath15 leads to the formulation for the kdv equation : @xmath108 but this coincides with the well - known multi - symplectic form  @xcite since in this case @xmath109 .      to solve the benjamin equation numerically , it is mandatory to discretize the operators @xmath9 and @xmath110 .",
    "in particular , the operator @xmath7 should be discretized so that the symmetry is kept in the discrete setting .",
    "we first review the approach developed by thome ",
    "vasudeva murthy  @xcite .",
    "however , as will be explained soon , their approach only makes sense when the domain is divided into even intervals .",
    "therefore , we shall develop a new discretization method for odd intervals so that the preissmann box scheme is applicable .      in  @xcite a discrete version of the hilbert",
    "transform for @xmath111 is defined by @xmath112 here , the midpoint rule is used for each interval @xmath113 $ ] ( @xmath114 ) . this definition is rewritten as a discrete convolution @xmath115 here we note that @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "furthermore , we rewrite by using the discrete fourier transform . for @xmath118 ,",
    "the discrete fourier transform @xmath119 is defined by @xmath120 which also belongs to @xmath31 . for @xmath121 , the inverse transform @xmath122 is defined by @xmath123    [ tm : lem41 ] the discrete hilbert transform defined in is expressed as @xmath124 where @xmath125 is defined by @xmath126    the following lemma indicates that @xmath127 is a second order approximation to @xmath128 .",
    "[ tm : lem42 ] assume that @xmath38 is periodic and sufficiently smooth .",
    "then it follows that @xmath129 where @xmath128 is an abbreviation of @xmath130^\\top$ ] , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .      in above",
    ", we defined a discrete version of the operator @xmath9 for even @xmath66 , and discussed its accuracy .",
    "for the preissmann box scheme , however , we need its odd number counterpart . recall that the discrete hilbert transform is written through the discrete fourier transform in .",
    "we wish to obtain a similar expression for odd @xmath66 . for this aim , it is convenient to split into two terms : @xmath133 for the first term , we apply the midpoint rule to each interval @xmath134 $ ] ( @xmath135 ) and the rule @xmath136 to the remaining interval @xmath137 $ ] . for the second term , we apply the midpoint rule to each interval @xmath138 $ ] ( @xmath135 ) and the rule @xmath139 to the remaining interval @xmath140 $ ] .",
    "we now define a discrete hilbert transform by @xmath141 this is rewritten as a discrete convolution @xmath142 and thus it can be expressed through the discrete fourier transform as desired .    the discrete hilbert transform defined in",
    "is expressed as @xmath143 where @xmath144 is defined by @xmath145    the proof is similar to that of .",
    "since @xmath146 is written as a convolution in , it immediately follows that@xmath147 .",
    "hence , we wish to prove that @xmath148 , or equivalently @xmath149 , where @xmath150 and its components are @xmath151 it follows that @xmath152    assume that @xmath38 is periodic and sufficiently smooth .",
    "then it follows that @xmath129 where @xmath128 is an abbreviation of @xmath130^\\top$ ] , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "the proof is similar to that of .",
    "first , we re - express the continuous and discrete hilbert transforms ( and ) as follows : @xmath153 we here define three function @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 by @xmath157 below , by using these functions , we show that @xmath158 .",
    "hereafter , we promise that @xmath159 is a generic constant independently of @xmath160 and @xmath38 .",
    "first , we rewrite @xmath161 as follows",
    ". @xmath162 by the standard error estimate for the midpoint and rectangular rules , there exist constants @xmath163 ( @xmath164 ) and @xmath165 , and we proceed with the estimate @xmath166 here we note that @xmath167 is independent of @xmath38 and thus its norms are bounded .",
    "thus we have @xmath168 by the taylor expansion , @xmath169 from which we obtain @xmath158 .",
    "we now define a discrete version of the operator @xmath110 . since the discrete hilbert transform defined above is formulated in terms of the discrete fourier transform , one convenient way for discretizing @xmath32",
    "is to employ the spectral difference , i.e. , for @xmath170 , @xmath171 where @xmath172 is defined by @xmath173 note that this is a real matrix ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "we now define an operator @xmath174 by @xmath175 where @xmath176 if @xmath66 is even , and @xmath177 if @xmath66 is odd .",
    "this is a symmetric matrix as the next lemma shows , which is crucial in the subsequent theoretical analyses .",
    "the operator @xmath174 is symmetric in the sense that @xmath178 .",
    "note that @xmath179 is a real matrix for both even and odd @xmath66 , which is clear from the original definition . as noted above",
    ", the spectral difference operator is also real .",
    "thus the matrix @xmath174 is real , and it suffices to show @xmath180 , where @xmath181 denotes the hermitian conjugate . but it is clear since @xmath182 and @xmath40 are both real diagonal matrices .",
    "we apply the euler box scheme to the formulation ( just for simplicity , we consider the simplified version only ) . to do this",

    "next we consider the global conservation laws and .",
