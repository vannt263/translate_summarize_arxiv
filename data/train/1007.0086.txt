    "the third component such as @xmath175 is assumed to be zero when we identify the original dirac equation ( in @xmath176 dimensional space - time ) with the effective hamiltonian for graphene ( in @xmath177 dimensional space - time ) .",
    "here we consider the solitons in armchair nanotubes .",
    "the k point hamiltonian is given by removing @xmath104 from equation  ( 5 ) . by putting @xmath178 into the energy eigenequation  ( 5 ) , we obtain @xmath179 for the zero - energy state .",

    "this mixing term is small because a smooth function @xmath188 of @xmath46 is multiplied by a rapid oscillating function @xmath189 .",
    "moreover , the chirality mixing term does not cause a first order energy shift since the unperturbed states @xmath190 are pseudospin polarized states satisfying @xmath191 .",

    "@xcite for `` semiconducting '' zigzag tubes , the quantized @xmath67 misses the dirac singularity , and therefore such a zero - energy topological soliton does not exist .",
    "thus , only the presence of a non - vanishing @xmath92 field strength does not necessarily result in the presence of a zero - energy state .",

    "<S> this shows that a domain wall can be realized by a strain of @xmath166 10% .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite similarly , a strain produces a localized soliton in a metallic armchair nanoribbon ( see appendix  [ app:5 ] ) . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the ribbon does not support the edge states without the strain . a pseudospin polarized wavefunction pattern that is spatially localized near the bottom of a `` @xmath159 '' shape graphene nanoribbon is the indication of a chirality mixed soliton . </S>",
    "<S> note that a strain makes it possible to observe the soliton by means of a scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiment , in contrast to that the stm is unable to detect a soliton in polyacetylene since the soliton is moving . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it was suggested recently by guinea _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that a uniform @xmath92 field may be realized in graphene by a strain - induced lattice deformation , which is an interesting consequence . </S>",
    "<S> if this is the case , it is expected that the landau level appears only for one chirality and the other chirality decouples from the gauge fields in the presence of a magnetic field which eliminates @xmath92 for one chirality . </S>",
    "<S> then the chiral symmetry in graphene is maximally broken , and this situation is similar to the case of weak interactions in elementally particle physics . </S>"
