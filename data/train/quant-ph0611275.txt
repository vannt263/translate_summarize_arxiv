    "quantum heat engines ( qhes ) @xcite produce work using quantum matter as their working substance . because of the quantum nature of the working substance , qhe have unusual and exotic properties .",
    "for example , under some conditions , qhe can surpass the maximum limit on the amount of work done by a classical thermodynamic cycle @xcite and also surpass the efficiency of a classical carnot engine cycle scully - science .",
    "qhes offer good model systems to study the relation between thermodynamics and quantum mechanics .",
    "meanwhile , they can highlight the difference between classical and quantum thermodynamic systems , and help us understand the quantum - classical transition problem of thermodynamic processes @xcite .",
    "the classical carnot heat engine is a well - known machine that produces work through thermodynamic cycles .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the four strokes of each cycle are simple and demonstrate the universal physical mechanism of heat engines .",
    "current studies kieu1,kieu2,scully - science , quan2,bender1,bender2,scully - pra , opatrny , pce , arnaud1,arnaud2,mahler on qhe mostly focus on the quantum analogue of classical carnot engines , i.e. , the quantum carnot engine ( qce ) .",
    "the quantum otto engine ( qoe ) is another interesting case of a qhe , which is also attracting considerable attentions @xcite .",
    "however , we find that there is no universal and consistent definition of the qce and the qoe in literatures ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "scully - science , opatrny , scully - pra , scully2,allahverdyan ) , and  thus the properties of qces and qoe are not always addressed adequately and clearly .",
    "any qhe cycle consists of several basic quantum thermodynamic processes , such as quantum adiabatic processes ( which have been clarified in many references , e.g. , @xcite ) , quantum isothermal processes and quantum isochoric processes .",
    "this paper begins by clarifying the concepts of isothermal processes , isochoric processes and effective temperatures in their quantum mechanical pictures",
    ". then we systematically study the general properties of a quantum analogue of a carnot engine .",
    "the difference between a qce and its classical counterpart is indicated clearly .",
    "we also study the qoe based on its basic quantum thermodynamic process and analyze the relation between these two types of qhes . here",
    "we assume that the processes of our thermodynamic cycles are infinitely slow , i.e. , the time interval of each process is assumed to be very long .",
    "accordingly , the output power is very small .",
    "this is also the requirement of quasi - static processes .",
    "assuming fast cycles would increase the output powers , but at the expense of reduced engine efficiency .",
    "also , some experimentally realizable physical systems , which can be used to implement our qce and qoe , are discussed .",
    "furthermore , based on our generalized qoe model , we demonstrate that there is no violation of the second law , even in the presence of a maxwell s demon .    our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we give a clear definition of quantum isothermal and isochoric processes based on the quantum identification of work performed and heat exchange . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the qce cycle and calculate the work done during this cycle and its operation efficiency . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the qoe cycle and compare it with the classical otto engine cycle . in sec .",
    "v we compare these two kinds of qhes and study the relation between them . in sec .",
    "vi we give some examples of these two kinds of qhes considering experimentally - realizable physical systems . in sec .",
    "vii we discuss the qoe and maxwell s demon . conclusions and remarks are given in sec .",
    "to define quantum isothermal and quantum isochoric processes , we need to first consider the working substance .",
    "an arbitrary quantum system with a finite number of energy levels is used here as the working substance ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "( of course , this can be generalized to systems with an infinite number of energy levels ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the working substance can be written as@xmath0where @xmath1 is the @xmath2-th eigen state of the system and @xmath3 is its corresponding eigen energy . without loss of generality , we choose the eigen energy of the ground state @xmath4 as a reference point ( see appendix a ) .",
    "then the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) can be rewritten as@xmath5below we will show that it is convenient for our discussion about qhes to use the hamiltonian ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "the internal energy @xmath6 of the working substance can be expressed as@xmath7for a given occupation distribution with probabilities @xmath8 in the @xmath2-th eigen state .    to clearly define quantum isothermal and isochoric processes , we need to identify the quantum analogues of the heat exchange @xmath9 and the work performed @xmath10 .  from eq .",

    "these results indicate that the properties , such as the operation efficiency , of macroscopic ( classical ) heat engines can be obtained from the microscopic ( quantum ) level as long as we clarify the basic thermodynamic processes microscopically . in the previous discussions ,",
    "our qce and qoe model show no contradiction with the thermodynamic laws .    in one of our recent studies",

    "it is interesting that when the restoration of the demon are properly included into the qhe cycle , the efficiency of the maxwell s demon assisted qhe cycle has the same form as that for a qoe derived previously ( [ 17 ] ) .",

    "we first analyze a single - reservoir thermodynamic cycle with external control based on the effective temperature defined above .",
    "it can be proved that the property of this cycle is similar to that of the qhe cycle proposed in ref .",
    "our thermodynamic cycle consists of three steps : ( 1 ) quantum rotation , ( 2 ) decoherence , and ( 3 ) thermalization .",
    "after the thermalization process , the state of the two - level system ( with the ground state @xmath53 , the excited state @xmath54 and the level spacing @xmath55 ) can be described by a density matrix @xmath56where the probability distributions @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the two - level system are determined by the temperature @xmath59 of the heat reservoir and the level spacing @xmath55 .",
    "then the two - level system , driven by an external field ( we do not treat it as a part of the system for the moment ) , undergoes a rotation ,    @xmath60    if the time interval of this rotation is much shorter than the relevant time of the thermalization , the state @xmath61  of the two - level system becomes@xmath62where @xmath63and @xmath64 denotes the off - diagonal terms , which disappear rapidly ( pure dephasing ) due to the coupling between the two - level system and the reservoir . actually two effects ( dephasing and dissipation )",

    "but we can imagine there is such a reservoir at temperature @xmath67 , which can be expressed as @xmath68this effective temperature @xmath69 possesses some exotic features .",

    "after the thermalization process , the state @xmath76 returns to @xmath61 , and a thermodynamic cycle is finished and the two - level system seems to extract work from a single heat bath .",
    "we can imagine it as  a thermodynamic cycle between two reservoirs with the temperature @xmath59 and a virtual temperature @xmath67 .",
    "actually contradictions to the second law can appear due to this negative temperature '' .",
    "it is not surprising that the above result ( a contradiction to the second law ) appears since we do not include the controller for the rotation operators shown in eq .",
    "( [ 50.2 ] ) .",
    "this result is very similar to those single - particle heat engines assisted by classical maxwell s demon proposed by szilard .",
    "now , let us describe a new version of szilard single - particle heat engine ( see fig . 8) .",

    "if the measurement result is confirmed that the system is in its upper state , then the spin is flipped and positive work is done by the spin with an amount @xmath77 . if the measurement result confirms that the system is in its lower state , then no work is done .",

    "this is a two - step maxwell s demon - assisted qhe .",

    "this is a perpetual machine of the second kind .",
    "this apparent violation of the second law is seen because the erasure of the demon is not included into the qhe cycle .      in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have demonstrated that , when the erasure of the information stored in the maxwell s demon is considered into the qhe cycle , the apparent violation of the second law does not hold , i.e. , there is no violation of the second law even in the existence of such a maxwell s demon .    to show the above observation ,",
