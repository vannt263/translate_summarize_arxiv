    "their main result was that any contact form whose reeb vector field is regular essentially arises in this way .",
    "these contact structures are transverse to the @xmath1-fibres .",

    "we extend his results to higher dimensions .",
    "we derive a necessary ( proposition  [ prop : decomposition ] ) and sufficient ( theorem  [ thm : existence ] ) condition for an @xmath1-bundle to admit an invariant contact structure .",
    "our explicit way of building an invariant contact structure from a certain symplectic splitting of the base manifold is inspired by the work of giroux  @xcite on convex hypersurfaces ( corresponding to @xmath3-invariant contact structures ) , and it extends a construction by stipsicz and the second author  @xcite from trivial to nontrivial bundles .",
    "in fact , as a consequence of our existence criterion we can show that if the trivial @xmath1-bundle over a given base manifold admits an invariant contact structure , then the same is true for all nontrivial @xmath1-bundles ( corollary  [ cor : bundles ] ) . combining this with the main result from  @xcite",
    "we conclude that all @xmath1-bundles over @xmath0-manifolds carry invariant contact structures",
    ".    in section  [ subsection : bourgeois ] we discuss the relation of the results in the present paper with bourgeois s construction of @xmath4-invariant contact structures on @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is any closed contact manifold , starting from an open book decomposition of  @xmath6 .    in section  [ subsection : twist ] we demonstrate by an example that the topology of the total space of the @xmath1-bundle is not , in general , determined by the symplectic splitting of the base .",
    "however , as we prove in section  [ section : liouville ] , once the topology of the bundle is fixed , the symplectic splitting of the base determines the invariant contact structure on the @xmath1-bundle up to equivariant diffeomorphism .",

    "principal @xmath1-bundles over @xmath18 are classified by their euler class in integral cohomology @xmath30 .",
