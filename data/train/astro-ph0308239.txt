    "gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) have recently been shown to be associated with supernova ( sn ) events .",
    "this is based , most notably , on the burst grb 030329 , in whose optical afterglow the supernova ( labelled sn 2003dh ) photometric and spectral signatures show up 9.6 days @xcite after the @xmath0-ray trigger .",
    "this late brightening of the supernova is caused by the large initial opacity to optical photons of the envelope of the exploding supernova .",
    "the collapse of the stellar core is thought to lead , for progenitor stellar masses in excess of 30 @xmath1 , to a blackhole responsible for the grb ( e.g. @xcite for a review ) , while for less massive progenitors it leads to a rotating neutron star , typically detectable as a pulsar .",
    "a question of great interest is whether the supernova explosion of a progenitor in excess of @xmath2 can lead to a black hole promptly ( on a timescale comparable to the core collapse free - fall time ) , or else after some delay , during which an initial pulsar accretes additional gas which falls back onto it from the envelope @xcite . in the extreme version of this scenario",
    "the collapse to a black hole is delayed by weeks to months @xcite .",
    "optical observations can not test the time off - set which characterizes this scenario to an accuracy better than a few days @xcite , due to observational difficulties and uncertainties in modeling the diffusive photon transport in the dynamically evolving envelope .",
    "neutrinos , however , are not subject to the very long diffusion times of photons , due to their much lower opacities , and should provide a much tighter time - tracking of the collapse .",
    "while thermal ( mev ) neutrinos produced in the collapse are presently undetectable except from the very nearest galaxies , ultra - high energy ( @xmath3 tev ) neutrinos from grbs are expected to be detectable from cosmological distances with kilometer scale cherenkov detectors @xcite or giant air - shower detector @xcite . here",
    "we calculate the @xmath3 tev neutrino signatures associated with the collapse of massive stellar progenitors of grb , both in the case where a supernova envelope is ejected simultaneously with , or sometime before , the grb event .",
    "we calculate the resulting muon and electron cascade events in kilometer scale sub - ice detctors , and discuss the characteristic signatures associated with various time off - sets between the grb and the sn .",

    "the peak flux is @xmath15 erg @xmath16 s@xmath11 with 1.2 s duration .",
    "the isotropic @xmath0-ray luminosity @xmath17 erg / s is then approximately the same as the typical value for long bursts .",
    "we take the progenitor star to have an original mass of @xmath18 , which subsequently lost its h envelope leaving behind a he core of @xmath19 in its presupernova phase .",
    "the he core has initially a smaller radius of @xmath20 , for a solar metallicity star , but grows larger later in its he burning stage . the density profile of the star can be roughly estimated as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 g/@xmath23 and @xmath24 cm in the presupernova phase @xcite . in case of @xmath25 , for radiative envelope , @xmath26 g/@xmath23 for @xmath27 .",

    "we consider here two scenarios : first , the sn takes place 0.1 - 8 days prior to the ( electromagnetically detected ) grb event ; and second , both the sn and the grb occur simultaneously .",
    "the neutrino fluxes from these two scenarios differ significantly , as discussed in the following section .",
