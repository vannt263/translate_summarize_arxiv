    "particle physics theories beyond the standard model generally predict phase transitions in the early universe , during which topological defects can appear @xcite .",
    "since they are , by definition , topologically stable , they may survive up to now and have detectable effects .",
    "in particular , one - dimensional defects , called _ cosmic strings _",
    "@xcite , appear quite generally and are thought to reach a _ scaling regime _ , so that their contribution to the energy density of the universe remains finite and constant .",
    "due to the fact that these objects can be extremely heavy they were believed to be a possible source of the density perturbations that led to structure formation and the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "however , the detailed measurements of the cmb power spectrum as obtained by cobe , boomerang and wmap demonstrated that cosmic strings can not be the main source for these anisotropies .",
    "however , in recent years it has been suggested that cosmic strings should generically form at the end of inflation in inflationary models resulting from string theory @xcite such as brane inflation @xcite .",
    "moreover , cosmic strings seem to be a generic prediction of supersymmetric hybrid inflation @xcite and grand unified based inflationary models @xcite .",
    "even though the origin of these cosmic superstrings is string theory , their properties can be investigated in the framework of field theoretical models @xcite .",
    "in general cosmic strings can not end .",
    "this allows for two kinds of strings : loops and infinitely extended strings .",
    "infinite strings are thought to be relatively straight on macroscopic scales and their width is typically much smaller than their extent .",
    "a string can thus be described in good approximation by a one - dimensional object , characterized by quantities integrated over a plane orthogonal to it .",
    "this procedure is generally not well - defined in curved space - time , but can be used here since the metric generated by the string is `` nearly minkowskian '' reasonably far away from it . for infinite straight strings , there are in fact only two relevant quantities : the energy per unit length @xmath1 and the tension @xmath2 . in the simplest field theoretical model , namely the abelian - higgs model , these quantities are equal @xcite .",
    "this can be related to the necessary lorentz invariance along the string axis .",
    "but if neutral currents or some microscopic structures ( for instance wiggles ) are taken into account @xcite , then the energy per unit length can be larger than the tension .",
    "if the tension would be larger than the energy per unit length the string would be unstable under transverse perturbations .",
    "the relation between the energy per unit length and the tension of a superconducting string solution of the @xmath0 model has been discussed in detail in @xcite using the formalism developed by carter @xcite and it has been suggested that the equation of state is of logarithmic form . this has been confirmed numerically in @xcite .",
    "it is also of interest for a possible observation of cosmic strings how the space  time of such an object looks like and how test particles would move in this space  time . in the case of infinitely thin standard cosmic strings , i.e. cosmic strings without additional structure that fulfill @xmath3 , the space ",
    "time is locally flat and geodesics are just straight lines .",
    "however , the space ",
    "time is globally conical with deficit angle @xmath4 and as such light gets deflected by a cosmic string .",
    "next to the observation of cosmic string signals in the power and polarization spectra of the cmb @xcite this lensing property of cosmic strings has been suggested to be the prime signature of these objects .",
    "taking the finite width of the cosmic string into account @xcite bound orbits of massive test particles are possible , while massless particles can only move on escape orbits .",
    "the exterior metric of a superconducting string carrying timelike and spacelike currents , respectively , has been first discussed in @xcite , while lensing properties of a cosmic string with a lightlike current have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the space - time of cosmic strings with a non - degenerate energy - momentum tensor has been given in @xcite and it has been shown that the parameters in the general kasner space - time @xcite can be given in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this will describe e.g. the exterior of superconducting strings as well as strings with wiggles @xcite .",
    "when considering concrete field theoretical models of gravitating cosmic strings to describe their microscopic properties , we need to solve the set of coupled einstein and matter field equations numerically .",
    "this has been done for abelian - higgs strings without currents in @xcite . in this paper , we are interested in solving the full set of coupled einstein and matter fields equations of a @xmath0 model describing superconducting string solutions with either timelike or spacelike currents in curved space - time",
    ". we will hence be able to determine the metric functions on the full interval from the string axis out to infinity .",
    "our paper is organised as follows : in section ii , we discuss the field theoretical model describing gravitating @xmath0 superconducting strings . in section iii , we discuss our numerical results and in particular match our solutions to the kasner solutions . in section iv",
    ", we comment on test particle motion in these space - times and we conclude in section v.",
    "in the following , we will consider the @xmath0 model in curved space - time .",
    "the action reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the ricci scalar and @xmath7 denotes newton s constant .",
    "the matter lagrangian @xmath8 reads : @xmath9 with the covariant derivative @xmath10 and the field strength tensor @xmath11 , of the u(1 ) gauge potential @xmath12 with coupling constant @xmath13 .",
    "the fields @xmath14 and @xmath15 are complex scalar fields with potential @xmath16    in cylindrical coordinates @xmath17 we choose the following ansatz for the matter fields @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the metric . in the flat space - time limit ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath20 we can define a lorentz - invariant quantity @xmath21 which is typically used to categorize the solutions into the timelike , spacelike and chiral type for @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively . in the following",
    ", we will adopt the viewpoint that we can always go to a suitable frame of reference to choose either @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "hence @xmath27 and @xmath28 corresponds to the spacelike and the timelike case , respectively .",
    "the dynamics of the metric is given by the einstein equations which read @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor given by @xmath31    the components of the ricci tensor then are @xcite @xmath32 where here and in the following the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath33 .",
    "we use the rescalings @xmath34 where @xmath35 corresponds to the mass of the higgs field .",
    "the components of the energy - momentum tensor and the field equations will then depend only on the following dimensionless coupling constants @xmath36 the constant @xmath37 corresponds to the squared ratio between the symmetry breaking scale and the planck mass @xmath38 .",
    "in general , we would expect this to be very small ( e.g. on the order of @xmath39 for gut scale strings ) , however , we will typically also investigate the solutions for higher values of @xmath37 to understand the general pattern of solutions .",
    "the components of the energy - momentum tensor ( in units of @xmath40 ) are @xmath41 where @xmath42 @xmath43 the three independent einstein equations then read @xmath44 subject to the constraint ( which is not independent ) @xmath45 the euler - lagrange equations which result from the variation of the action with respect to the matter fields are @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 equations ( [ eeq1])-([eeq3 ] ) and ( [ el1])-([el3 ] ) have to be solved subject to appropriate boundary conditions . at @xmath49",
    "the requirement of regularity and the fact that we would like string - like solutions leads to @xmath50 finiteness of energy requires that @xmath51    in our numerical calculations , we have solved the coupled system ( [ eeq1])-([eeq3 ] ) , ( [ el1])-([el3 ] ) subject to the boundary conditions ( [ bc1 ] ) , ( [ bc2 ] ) . in all our calculations",
    ", we have checked that ( [ constraint ] ) is fulfilled .      in",
    "@xcite the energy per unit length @xmath1 and tension @xmath2 have been used as macroscopic parameters to describe superconducting string solutions in the @xmath0 model in flat space - time and to investigate the stability of these objects .",
    "the corresponding expressions in curved space - time are a straightforward generalization of that and read @xmath52 where @xmath53 corresponds to the determinant of the induced metric on the @xmath54-plane .",
    "it is also possible to define the so - called tolman mass of these solutions which corresponds to the gravitational active mass ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but we would like to compare our results to the flat space - time limit studied in @xcite and hence define @xmath2 and @xmath1 as given above . furthermore , the noether current associated to the unbroken u(1 ) symmetry reads @xmath55 which has non - vanishing , dimensionless components @xmath56 this current is covariantly conserved @xmath57 , which implies @xmath58 and since @xmath59 is independent of @xmath54 we have @xmath60 .",
    "finally , we can also define the charge number density ( in analogy to @xcite ) which reads @xmath61 in @xcite a macroscopic stability condition for superconducting strings has been suggested .",
    "this requires that the propagation speeds of transverse ( t ) and longitudinal ( l ) perturbations , respectively , should both be real for the string to be stable .",
    "the squared propagation speeds are given by @xmath62 and should hence both be positive .",
    "since our definitions of @xmath2 and @xmath1 are covariantly defined expressions and the original work of carter was formulated in a fully covariant way @xcite , we expect these criteria to also hold in the gravitating case and use them in the following to decide about the stability of gravitating superconducting strings .      far away from the string core where the matter functions have reached their vacuum values , we would expect that the metric functions have the behaviour of those of a general cylindrically symmetric vacuum space - time given by the kasner metric which has the following form @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are real coefficients subject to the kasner conditions : @xmath67 while @xmath68 can be thought of as the typical radius of the string .",
    "@xmath69 is an additional parameter that determines the deficit angle of the space - time @xmath70 .",
    "note that the first kasner condition can be used to eliminate @xmath66 in the second one .",

    ". then @xmath65 is given by : @xmath72 so that @xmath73 .    in @xcite",
    "it was argued that with the identification @xmath74 the kasner metric would describe the outside of a general cosmic string with energy per unit length @xmath1 and tension @xmath2 under the assumption that the string is infinite , straight and has negligible width .",
    "the deficit angle of the space - time is then given by @xmath75 .",
    "for `` standard '' cosmic strings we have @xmath3 and the metric describes a conical space - time with deficit angle @xmath76 @xcite . in this case , the space - time is locally flat and geodesics are just straight lines . since the space - time has a deficit angle , gravitational lensing appears , but planetary , i.e. bound orbits are not possible .",
    "note that this changes when taking the finite core of the cosmic string into account @xcite .",
    "the solutions to the equations ( [ eeq1])-([eeq3 ] ) and ( [ el1])-([el3 ] ) are only known numerically .",

    "we have restricted our analysis to the case @xmath78 unless otherwise stated .      in fig.[electric ]",

    "as is apparent , the matter functions vary only very little ( the different cases are barely distinguishable on the plot ) , however , the metric functions change quite strongly . when increasing @xmath37 the metric functions @xmath84 and @xmath85 deviate more strongly from their flat space - time values @xmath86 , while the slope of @xmath87 at large @xmath33 decreases with increasing @xmath37 signaling as expected  an increase in the deficit angle of the space  time .",
    "+    the outside space - time of a superconducting string should be given by the kasner space - time with a specific relation between the kasner coefficients and @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( see ( [ parameters ] ) ) @xcite .",

    "we give the values of the kasner coefficients in dependence on @xmath96 for a superconducting string with timelike current ( the results are qualitatively similar in the spacelike case , this is why we do not present them here ) and @xmath80 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath83 .",

    "if we consider the numerically given space - time in terms of the metric functions @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 we have to solve the geodesic equation numerically .",
    "this approach has been taken in @xcite for standard cosmic strings and it was found that the finite core width of the string allows for additional bound orbits of massive test particles close to the string core . since the string core and hence also the radius of the orbits are on the same order as the inverse scalar boson mass these can not account for planetary orbits .",
    "on the other hand , the string could be `` dressed '' by massive particles and this could be important for gravitational wave emission . however , our numerical results indicate that the power of this emission would be rather small .",
    "this is why we do not investigate this further here .",
    "as shown above , we find that the metric outside the string core is well matched by the kasner space - time . since this space - time can be given analytically we are able to make some general statements about the geodesic motion .",
    "since the observation of gravitational lensing by a cosmic string has been suggested as a possibility to detect these objects directly , we discuss the motion of massless test particles in the kasner space - time in the following",

    "we studied the domain of existence and the dependence of the maximal and minimal radius on the kasner coefficients and constants of motion , as well as the light deflection using _ maple _ and _",
    "mathematica_.      given the parameters @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 in the kasner metric , a natural question is what values of @xmath69 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath161 allow for solutions of the equations of motion .",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition is that the potential must be negative somewhere . for @xmath167 or",
    "@xmath201 , the dominant term at zero or infinity respectively is @xmath202 .",
    "therefore , solutions always exist . for @xmath203 0,2/3 \\right[$ ] ,",
    "the domain in which solutions exist can be computed numerically .",
    "for massless particles , since @xmath68 can be taken equal to one by rescaling @xmath33 and @xmath69 can be taken to one by rescaling @xmath161 , the function @xmath204 depends only on two parameters , for instance on @xmath205 and @xmath206 for @xmath207 , @xmath208 .",
    "moreover , because of the aforementioned duality , we can restrict our attention to the @xmath160 solution . for massive particles ,",
    "@xmath138 becomes a physically relevant parameter .",
    "the domain in which solutions exist tend towards the one obtained for @xmath209 in the limit @xmath210 and shrink when @xmath138 decreases . for @xmath173",
    ", we found analytically that solutions exist if and only if @xmath211 for the @xmath159 case or @xmath212 for the @xmath160 case ( in units @xmath207 ) .",
    "for @xmath213 , these conditions become @xmath214 or @xmath215 for the @xmath159 and @xmath160 case respectively .",
    "our results are summarized in fig.[doe1 ] for massless particles and particular choices of @xmath138 .",
    "the most important difference to the case @xmath113 in which geodesics are just straight lines because the space - time is locally flat is that we can have bound orbits for massive and massless test particles in the general kasner space - time . in fig.[boundorbits1 ] we show bound orbits for a massive and massless test particle , respectively .",
    "the bound orbit of a massive test particle shows the typical perihelion shift of orbits in curved space - time .",
    "the bound orbit of the massless test particle also possesses this perihelion shift , however looks qualitatively rather like a spiral .",
    "we observe that this in related to the choice of @xmath64 , which is quite big .",
    "for @xmath64 small the orbit of a massless particle looks qualitatively similar to that of a massive one .    in fig.[escapeorbits1",
    "] we show escape orbits for a massive and massless test particle , respectively . in both cases , the test particles get deflected by the string , which is related to the presence of the deficit angle of the space - time .",
    "we observe that the massive test particle experiences a stronger deflection for the same values of all parameters as the massless one .      if the momenta are held fixed",
    ", the minimal and maximal radii of the bound orbits are decreasing functions of @xmath64 .",
    "the maximal radius generally goes to infinity when @xmath216 , while the minimum radius remains finite .",
    "this was to be expected since the orbits are unbound with finite minimal radius for @xmath167 ( let alone the very special case @xmath217 ) . for @xmath201 and fixed @xmath161 , @xmath138 , we find terminating bound orbits .",
    "the maximal radius decreases with @xmath139 , going to zero at infinity .",
    "it remains finite as @xmath218 , which was also expected from the above analysis . for @xmath219 , there are two critical values of @xmath139 above which the equations of motion can not be satisfied for @xmath220 , @xmath221 or @xmath222 , @xmath223 .",
    "the minimal and maximal radius merge at this point , and move apart from each other when we decrease @xmath139 .",
    "the merging of the minimal and maximal radius corresponds to a local minimum of the effective potential .",
    "if we consider the @xmath159 case , the maximal radius remains finite when @xmath218 , while the minimum one goes to zero . for the @xmath160 case ,",
    "it is @xmath224 which remains finite while @xmath225 goes to infinity if @xmath209 . for @xmath226",
    ", we find no maximal radius , and the minimal one increases with @xmath139 . in fig.[rmin_rmax ] we show the minimal and maximal radius of the bound orbits for a kasner space - time with @xmath227 , @xmath228 , @xmath229 and @xmath230 in dependence on @xmath141 .",
    "the test particle has @xmath163 and three different values of @xmath139 .",
    "the @xmath157 and @xmath152 curves meet at the circular orbit .",
    "we find that the interval of @xmath141 for which bound orbits exist increases when decreasing @xmath139 for a fixed @xmath138 .",
    "moreover , we observe that the radius of the circular orbit decreases with increasing @xmath139 . in addition , the circular orbit appears at smaller angular momentum @xmath141 when increasing @xmath139 .      for an unbound orbit",
    ", we can define the deviation angle as : @xmath231 where @xmath224 is the minimal distance from the string to the particle .    if all the other parameters are fixed , @xmath232 is a decreasing function of @xmath69 .",
    "it goes to infinity when @xmath233 and is equal to @xmath234 in conical space - time .",
    "( this is true in a coordinate system in which the metric has the kasner form and @xmath149 goes from @xmath144 to @xmath235 .",
    "a geometrical argument shows that it reduces to the usual @xmath236 in a locally flat coordinate system . )    for @xmath237 , the @xmath160 case gives an unbound orbit for massless particles with vanishing @xmath139 .",
    "we find that the deviation angle increases with @xmath64 .",
    "the deviation angle also seems to behave logarithmically in @xmath161 in the limit @xmath238 .",
    "for @xmath239 we have @xmath240 .",
    "this is related to the repulsive effect of the string : if the angular momentum vanishes , the particle just goes back to where it comes from .",
    "in this paper we have studied superconducting string solutions of the @xmath241 model in curved space - time . for small values of the ratio between the symmetry breaking scale and the planck mass we find that the metric outside the string core matches the kasner metric very well and the kasner coefficients can be given in terms of the energy per unit length @xmath1 and the tension @xmath2 as originally suggested in @xcite . in order to be able to decide about the macroscopic stability of these objects using the stability conditions given by carter @xcite we have to know the metric functions on the full interval @xmath242 .",
    "we have hence integrated the full coupled system of differential equations numerically and computed the energy per unit length and tension .",
    "we find that the coupling to gravity can stabilize the strings with large charge number density for sufficiently large values of the ratio between the symmetry breaking scale and the planck mass and that in general the phase frequency threshold is absent in curved space - time .",
    "as such , the energy per unit length and tension never diverge , but tend to more or less constant values for larger values of the charge number density .",
    "we have also studied the motion of test particles in the general kasner space - time and find that the fact that the energy per unit length is non - equal to the tension can lead to bound orbits of massive and massless test particle .",
    "the question is then whether these orbits are of interest for astrophysical or cosmological applications .",
    "we find that the radius of these orbits is too large to be of interest and that e.g. the gravitational wave emission from a particle moving on a bound orbit around a cosmic string would be far too small to be detectable .",
    "this  in turn  means that the assumption of an infinitely thin cosmic string that is often used in simulations of string networks is a valid assumption and that the additional structure on the string does not have a big influence on the results .",
