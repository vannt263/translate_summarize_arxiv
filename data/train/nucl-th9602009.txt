    "aside from the puzzling solar neutrino data there exist extensive measurements of atmospheric neutrinos , which are produced in cosmic ray interactions with the earth s atmosphere .",
    "cosmic rays , mostly protons or @xmath1 particles , hitting the atmosphere produce pions , which undergo the following decays : @xmath2 from this , one expects the neutrino flavor ratio , @xmath3 to be about 2 . however , two existing experiments , imb  @xcite and kamiokande  @xcite , consistently measured a ratio of about 1 by studying charged - current neutrino - nucleus reactions [ ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) and ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) ] in large underground water detectors .",
    "this could mean either there is a depletion of muon - type neutrinos or an enhancement of electron - type neutrinos .",
    "while the separate @xmath6 and @xmath4 neutrino fluxes differ in various calculations , their ratio , however , seems to be largely model - independent  @xcite , and the theoretical results are in clear contradiction with data .",
    "this discrepancy is known as the `` atmospheric neutrino anomaly '' .",
    "one explanation of this result could be the existence of neutrino oscillations of the muon neutrino into some other neutrino species  @xcite which would reduce the @xmath6 flux .",
    "however , before drawing this conclusion , one should also investigate more conventional sources for uncertainties in the measured flux ratio , which originate from nuclear physics and detector specifics .",
    "one crucial point is the experimental separation of electron and muon events .",

    "electrons and muons are distinguished by the characteristics of their tracks .",
    "electrons produce a showering `` fuzzy '' track , whereas muons are identified by their nonshowering track .",
    "pions constitute a major background in this way of determining the neutrino flavors . in the experimental analysis ,",
    "two- and more ring events , which signal the production of several charged particles , are rejected . however , a charged pion can be confused with a muon event if the lepton energy is below erenkov radiation threshold , and a neutral pion , with one decay photon missing , can be counted as an electron event .",
    "therefore , a reasonable determination of the flavor ratio can only be achieved when the pion events are properly taken into account .",
    "one major source of pions is the decay of a @xmath0 produced in the neutrino scattering .",
    "the delta can subsequently decay into a pion and a nucleon .",
    "an estimate of the number of pion events is only possible when the @xmath0-h response is properly calculated . indeed , monte carlo simulation of the kamiokande experiment  @xcite estimated the number of pion events based on a rather complicated nonrelativistic model  @xcite . however , atmospheric neutrinos have a broad energy spectrum ranging from a few hundred mev to several gev .",
    "it is therefore crucial to have a relativistic formalism that allows the calculation of the cross section for arbitrary kinematics .    as another source of pions ,",
    "we consider coherent pion production and its role in the detection of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "coherent pions are produced in both charged- and neutral - current neutrino - nucleus interactions which leave the nucleus in its ground state .",
    "traditionally , the coherent @xmath9 s are distinguished from the resonantly produced pions due to their strongly forward peaked angular distribution .",
    "however , in atmospheric neutrino experiments , due to a lack of directional information of the incoming neutrinos , it is not possible to distinguish the coherent @xmath9 events from incoherent pions .    in the case of coherent charged pions the forward angle dominance of",
    "the cross section leads to a small opening angle between two charged particles ( @xmath7 or @xmath5 and charged pion ) in the final state , and these two particles could be detected as one isolated electromagnetic shower .",
    "in contrast to incoherent charged pions whose erenkov tracks are usually identified as muon events , the special characteristics of coherent pions could lead to an increase of identified @xmath4 events and thus to underestimating the @xmath6 to @xmath4 ratio .",

    "the strength of the @xmath0-h cross section provides the number of pions produced from the @xmath0 decays .",
    "these pions may cause an uncertainty in determining the lepton flavor in the experiment .",

    "their nonrelativistic results are qualitatively reproduced in our free delta calculations .",
    "thus mean - field effects are not included in the existing simulations and could provide significant systematic errors .    to get a rough estimate of the reduction in the number of events , we fold @xmath95 with a simple model of the atmospheric neutrino flux .",
    "we approximately fit the atmospheric muon neutrino flux with the formula  @xcite @xmath99 and assume @xmath100 using this flux , we calculate the yield y in units of events per kton year of detector exposure and per 100 mev energy bin , @xmath101 and plot the result in fig .",
    "[ yield ] ( a ) with respect to the muon energy for the p - h and @xmath0-h excitations .",

    "however , in the case of the inclusive process the quantitative results are insensitive to the decay width . at low muon energies , the mean fields in the impulse approximation reduce the total p - h events from 33 to 28 while including rpa yields 22 events ( in a 100 mev bin after one kton year of exposure assuming 100 percent efficiency ) .",
    "thus , nuclear structure effects reduce the quasielastic charged - current events substantially . since the electron events are also reduced by a similar amount by rpa correlations , this reduction does not directly affect the ratio @xmath102 of eq .",
    "( [ rat ] ) .",
    "however , it can change the _ energy dependence _ of the cross section .    also , as one can see from fig .",
    "[ yield ]  ( b ) , the @xmath0-h contribution is about 40% of the rpa calculation at its minimum and , as the muon energy increases , the @xmath0-h response becomes more important .",
    "the @xmath0-h response is even larger than the rpa response at high muon energies ( the ratio is 1.06 at @xmath103 gev ) .",
    "note that the @xmath0-h response is reduced by 10% to 25% due to mean - fields .",
    "incoherent pion events should be decreased correspondingly .",
    "therefore , the reduction due to the @xmath0 mean - fields combined with the event reduction from rpa should be properly taken into account in the simulation .",
    "not all deltas decay to @xmath40n in the nuclear medium .",
    "in fact , in the medium the @xmath40n decay is partially suppressed because of pauli blocking  @xcite . however , the @xmath0 in the medium has additional channels of pionless decay . the coincidence experiments of ( @xmath104 , @xmath105 ) reactions at the @xmath0 resonance  @xcite showed that a large portion of deltas in the medium decay without emitting pions .",
    "furthermore , in theoretical calculations , a value of about 70 mev has been used as the 2p-2h partial width  @xcite .",
    "thus , experimental and theoretical results indicate a substantial amount of pionless delta decay in the medium .",
    "this 2p-2h decay mode of the delta has not been directly included in present detector simulations . at best , its effects",
    "have been partially incorporated using a very crude model of pion absorption without any explicit reference to @xmath0 production .",
    "the pionless decay of the delta and the reduction due to the mean - fields , suggest that the simulations may substantially overcount the total number of pions . at this moment",
    ", we do not know how these effects change the result for the atmospheric neutrino anomaly .",
    "but the results indicate that the monte carlo simulations in current atmospheric neutrino experiments can be improved to treat pion events more accurately .",
    "now we present results for coherent pion production in neutrino scattering .",
    "coherent pions may be important in atmospheric neutrino experiments because they could increase the electron - like events and therefore reduce the ratio @xmath102 of eq .",
    "( [ rat ] ) .",
    "a coherent neutral pion produced in neutral - current scattering ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) immediately decays into two photons and may be counted as an electron - like event .",
    "likewise , a coherent charged pion can also be confused with an electron - like event when the two charged particles in the final state , muon ( or electron ) and charged pion , move with small opening angle and make an isolated electromagnetic shower . indeed small - angle scattering dominates the coherent cross section .    the single differential cross section @xmath108 is obtained by numerically integrating eq .",
    "( [ double ] ) over the scattering solid angle .",
    "again , we use the free width @xmath109mev in our calculation .",
    "pauli - blocking and additional decay channels for the @xmath0 in the medium will change this value ( and generate a non - trivial momentum - dependence ) .",
    "however , as theoretical in - medium values are still very uncertain , we will not explore modifications of the width at this point .",
    "more work in this direction has to be done in the future .    in the atmospheric neutrino experiments ,",
    "both @xmath7- and @xmath5-neutrinos participate in producing coherent pions .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to the inclusive scattering process where the cross sections of antineutrinos are strongly suppressed , neutrino and antineutrino contributions to coherent pion production are of the same size . combining the events from @xmath7-type antineutrinos as well as @xmath5-type neutrinos and antineutrinos could enhance coherent pion production substantially , and it is of interest to quantitatively compare the coherent pion events directly with the inclusive charged - current events through p - h nuclear excitation for a realistic spectrum of neutrinos .",
    "using the @xmath5-neutrino flux ( @xmath110 ) , we calculate the coherent pion events and compare them with electron production in @xmath4 scattering .",
    "the neutral pion events per kiloton - year are @xmath111 the factor 6 includes the contribution from antineutrinos as well as a factor of 2 from @xmath7-neutrinos .",
    "note , for the purposes of illustration , let us assume all coherent pion events result in electron - like tracks .",
    "the actual identification of these events depends on the details of a detector . fig .",
    "[ ncohfig ]  ( a ) shows the coherent @xmath9 events with and without mean fields and @xmath0 decay width .",
    "the electron events from are obtained from @xmath112 the differential cross section @xmath113 is calculated in relativistic impulse and in random phase approximation  @xcite .",
    "note that the horizontal axis in fig .",
    "[ ncohfig ]  ( a ) shows either the coherent pion or the electron energy .",
    "figure  [ ncohfig ]  ( a ) also shows that at roughly @xmath114 mev the coherent pion events , neglecting decay width and mean fields , are comparable in size to electron events calculated in rpa .",
    "this is certainly interesting because the electron - like events can be increased by these pions and therefore might help to explain the small ratio @xmath102 of atmospheric neutrinos at @xmath114 mev .",
    "however , inclusion of mean fields reduces the pion events by a factor of 2 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0 decay width exacerbates the situation : the number of events including mean fields and @xmath0 decay width ( thin dashed line ) are only 10% of the electron events calculated in rpa .",
    "next , we consider the coherent charged pion events . in this case , the erenkov light detector records the total energy of pion and muon ( or electron ) assuming they are moving with small opening angle and make an isolated single track .",
    "overall energy conservation implies @xmath115 depending on the incoming neutrino type .",
    "the coherent charged pion events are calculated from @xmath116 the first term results from @xmath5-neutrinos ( the factor of 2 includes contribution from antineutrinos ) and the second term originates from muon - type neutrinos ( with a total flux factor of 4 ) .",
    "figure  [ ncohfig ]  ( b ) shows the coherent charged pion events and the electron events calculated in rpa . as in the case of @xmath9s neglecting mean field and decay width of the @xmath0 results in cross sections for the coherent pions comparable or even larger than the quasielastic ones .",
    "however , again mean fields and the decay width substantially reduce the pion events : at @xmath117 gev , the full calculation amounts to only 23% of the quasielastic electron events , but at @xmath118 gev , it increases to 30% .",
    "since the pion events become important as @xmath119 increases , our findings provide an important systematic error to the interpretation of the recent kamiokande experiment in the multi - gev energy range  @xcite .    the effect of neutral and charged coherent pions can be substantial , the actual numbers are very sensitive to the delta decay width , though",
    ". coherent @xmath9 production could be large at @xmath114 mev while coherent charged pions may become important for high visible energies . to solidify our results , however , a more elaborate study of the @xmath0 properties in the nucleus has to be performed .",
    "in this work , we have calculated neutrino - nucleus cross sections using a relativistic formalism to investigate possible improvements for the monte carlo simulation of kamiokande experiment . we have found that rpa corrections reduce the charged - current neutrino events by up to 37% for particle - hole excitations .",
    "because of this reduction , the @xmath0-h response could be important and is found to give significant corrections to quasi - elastic nucleon knock - out processes .",
    "we have found that the relativistic mean - fields reduce the @xmath0-h responses by 10% to 24% , which correspondingly reduce the pion events in atmospheric neutrino experiments .",
    "combined with the additional channel of the non - pionic decay of the delta in the medium , our findings suggest possible uncertainties in the present monte carlo simulations of detectors and the interpretation of the measured data .",

    "we have shown that coherent pions can produce a sizeable background in the atmospheric neutrino measurements . as neutral pions and collinearly outgoing charged leptons and pions",
