    "one of the most fundamental questions regarding galaxy formation and evolution is when and how the most massive galaxies in the universe formed . in the current @xmath16cdm paradigm ,",
    "the dominant structures in the universe are dark matter haloes that grow out of primordial density perturbations through gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "simulations and analytical models establish that this process proceeds in a hierarchical , bottom - up manner with low mass haloes forming first and subsequently growing by continued accretion and merging to form more massive haloes at later times @xcite .",
    "in contrast , observational studies suggest that the stellar baryonic component of haloes assemble in an anti - hierarchical , top - down manner @xcite .    closely related to this issue",
    "is the intriguing finding that the number density of the most massive galaxies ( @xmath17 ) seems to evolve very little from @xmath18 to @xmath19 @xcite , suggesting that very massive galaxies were already in place at @xmath20 , and implying that their stellar content was assembled rapidly in the first @xmath71.5 gyr of cosmic history .",
    "in contrast to the homogeneous population of massive galaxies in the nearby universe , the population of massive galaxies in the early universe is found to span a diverse range in stellar ages , star formation rates , and dust contents @xcite .",
    "studies of stellar mass complete samples of galaxies at high redshift reveal populations of both evolved quiescent galaxies and star - forming galaxies with varying degrees of dust attenuation @xcite .",
    "an additional class of dust - enshrouded and rigorously star forming high-@xmath21 massive galaxies are uncovered through detections at longer wavelengths ( sub - millimeter galaxies , smgs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the smg population is dominated by galaxies with sfrs @xmath22 more intense than main sequence galaxies at these redshifts with indications of ongoing merging @xcite .",
    "theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution severely under - predict the observed number density of galaxies at @xmath23 with @xmath24 @xcite , but systematic uncertainties in both photometric redshift and stellar mass estimates remain large .",
    "while several massive smgs have spectroscopically confirmed redshifts at @xmath0 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , they suffer from significant uncertainties in derived stellar population parameters @xcite . spectroscopically confirming the redshift of rest - frame optically selected galaxies is challenging as these sources are faint in the observers optical , requiring significant exposure times at even the largest telescopes ( but see @xcite for a massive @xmath25 passive galaxy ) .",
    "studies find that , of the massive galaxy population ( e.g. , @xmath26 ) at @xmath27 , approximately @xmath28 are no longer forming stars @xcite , and this population of quiescent galaxies undergoes significant size evolution . specifically , massive quiescent galaxies are found to be compact , particularly those with the lowest star formation rates , with sizes a factor of @xmath74 - 5x smaller at @xmath29 compared to local quiescent galaxies with similar stellar masses ( @xcite ; see @xcite for the latest comprehensive analysis on the size evolution of quiescent and star - forming galaxies ) .",
    "it has been suggested that dry minor mergers can cause a considerable growth in size without significantly increasing the mass of the galaxy , whereas major mergers tend to increase the mass without increasing the size much @xcite .",
    "a consistent size evolution through minor merging can be achieved as less massive satellite galaxies deposit mass preferentially in the outer radii of more massive central galaxies ( commonly referred to as _ inside - out growth _ ) .",
    "several recent works have indeed shown that the mass at fixed inner physical radius of massive , quiescent galaxies is nearly constant , whereas the mass in the outer regions undergoes a significant increase ( a factor of @xmath74 since @xmath302 ) , supporting the inside - out growth of massive , quiescent galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in order to understand the onset and evolution of massive galaxies , several recent works have aimed at identifying the potential progenitors of compact , massive quiescent galaxies observed at @xmath302 , based on number density considerations @xcite .",
    "two evolutionary tracks have been proposed for the formation of massive , quiescent galaxies : an early ( @xmath31 ) formation path of rapidly quenched compact star - forming galaxies fading into compact , quiescent galaxies that later enlarge within the quiescent phase ; and a late - arrival ( @xmath32 ) path in which quiescent galaxies are formed through the quenching of more extended star - forming galaxies with lower mass densities @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite studied the evolution of the properties of the progenitors of ultra - massive galaxies ( log(@xmath33 11.8 ; umgs ) at @xmath34 with a semi - empirical approach using abundance matching . at @xmath35 ,",
    "the progenitors of local umgs are found to be dominated by massive ( @xmath36 ) , dusty ( @xmath37 1 - 2.2 mag ) , and star forming ( sfr@xmath7100 - 400 @xmath38 ) galaxies , although a small fraction ( @xmath39 ) of them are found to be already quiescent at @xmath40 . the @xmath40 quiescent progenitors of local umgs",
    "are found to have properties typical of young ( 0.6 - 1 gyr ) post - starburst galaxies with little dust extinction ( @xmath410.4 mag ) and strong balmer breaks , showing a large scatter in rest - frame @xmath42 color ( @xmath70.2 mag ) .",
    "the existence of such quiescent progenitors at @xmath21 = 2.75 indicates that the early assembly of the massive end of the local quiescent red - sequence must have started at @xmath0 , as also implied by archeological studies in the local universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "evidence for the existence of massive ( @xmath43 ) galaxies at @xmath21 > 3 with suppressed star formation has been found through studies of deep near - infrared selected catalogs @xcite , with accurate photometric redshifts and well - sampled seds .",
    "however , spectroscopic observations are necessary to confirm the redshifts and to better characterize the properties of these galaxies .",
    "it is also of vital importance to determine agn and/or starburst contamination to the optical - to - mir seds of these sources to properly constrain the high - mass end of the stellar mass function at these redshifts .    in this paper , we present the first spectroscopic confirmation of a very massive galaxy at @xmath0 , c1 - 23152 , with a detailed investigation of its stellar population and structural properties , as well as the agn energetics .",
    "c1 - 23152 is the brightest ( @xmath44  mag , ab ) galaxy within the stellar mass complete ( @xmath45  m@xmath46 ) sample of 14 galaxies at @xmath23 presented in @xcite was initially selected from the newfirm medium - band survey ( nmbs ; @xcite ) .",

    "the large stellar surface densities observed in c1 - 23152 and other massive galaxies at @xmath440 imply they must have formed via rapid , highly dissipative events at earlier times to account for the relatively small half - light radii and high srsic index @xmath441 @xcite .",

    "its quenched star - formation activity while still harboring a hidden luminous agn makes c1 - 23152 a natural descendent of xid403 .",
    "furthermore , @xcite studying massive , quiescent @xmath450 galaxies have shown that based on number density considerations , the majority of the star formation in their progenitors could have been obscured by dust . with an intense burst of star formation in the recent past of c1 - 23152 , one may expect a significant amount of dust in c1 - 23152 as produced by supernovae .",
    "the upper limits on the amount of dust obscuration resulting from the sed modeling ( @xmath451 mag ) seems to imply that the mechanism responsible for the quenching of star formation in c1 - 23152 may also be responsible for the destruction of most of the dust produced in the intense starburst that produced the very large stellar mass of c1 - 23152 .",
    "however , in order to form conclusive and convincing evolutionary paths for the progenitors of post - starburst massive galaxies at @xmath452 , it is critical to investigate such scenarios by directly selecting progenitors by the use of some tracer , such as fixed number density or abundance matching , @xcite , or fixed velocity dispersion @xcite . in particular , finding clear and direct evidence linking c1 - 23152 and compact , dusty star - forming galaxies at higher redshifts ( such as the smg studied in @xcite , see also @xcite , or @xmath0 analogues of sf progenitors studied in @xcite ) would result in important constraints on timescales of dust formation and destruction .",
    "a few insights can be derived regarding the evolution of c1 - 23152 and the progenitors of local umgs at @xmath40 when examining figure  [ fig - uvj ] .",
    "the sf progenitors are predominantly found to be red in both u - v and v - j colors , indicating that they are dust - obscured . following the color evolution of local umg progenitors in @xcite to @xmath453 , when all sf progenitors are quenched , the region typically populated by post - starburst galaxies in the u - v versus v - j diagram is not re - populated , indicating that sf progenitors at @xmath406 appear to quench without losing dust , or quenching occurs significantly more rapidly than the destruction or removal of dust .",
    "the fact that there also exists a clear population of post - starburst galaxies at @xmath0 with properties similar to c1 - 23152 ( e.g. , overall sed shape , sfr and dust extinction ) with short star - formation time scales and little to moderate dust extinction implies that there are multiple paths for star - forming galaxies to join the quiescent population , characterized by different relative timescales responsible for quenching and dust removal .",
    "@xcite , examining galaxies with properties similar to those of compact , massive quiescent galaxies observed at @xmath29 with the illustris cosmological simulation find that there are multiple pathways to their formation .",
    "the dominant mechanisms responsible for the formation of this compact population are found to be either assembling at early times or through experiencing central starburst .",
    "galaxies that assemble at early cosmic epochs when the gas density of the universe is very dense are formed compact and remain so , whereas galaxies that experience a central starburst ( usually triggered through gas - rich mergers ) become compact at later times ( z=2 - 4 ) . while it is possible that both mechanisms play a role to a degree in the formation and evolution of galaxies similar to c1 - 23152 , it is essential to disentangle the more dominant mechanism",
    ". observationally , comparing the sizes of galaxies at different wavelengths can serve as a test ( with those experiencing central starbursts having smaller sizes at shorter wavelengths and vice versa ) . investigating the observational effects of dust for the different formation mechanisms in simulations",
    "is crucial , as it will provide insight into the color evolution of compact massive galaxies , perhaps explaining the multiple quenching modes of umg progenitors discussed above .",
    "spectroscopic observations in both the optical and in the nir of other candidates of very massive galaxies at @xmath454 are of vital importance to confirm their redshifts , to better characterize the properties of their stellar populations , to distinguish between dust - enshrouded star formation and highly - obscured agn activity , and to determine emission line and agn contamination to the seds and mass - to - light ratios .",
    "high s / n rest - frame optical spectroscopy ( especially redward of @xmath455 ) is needed to constrain star formation histories , sfrs , and metallicities , and to derive dynamical masses from stellar absorption lines for candidates of very massive galaxies in the first 2 gyr of cosmic history ( i.e. , @xmath0 ) .",
    "nirspec on the _ james webb space telescope _ will provide the instrumental capabilities and sensitivities to successfully target stellar - mass complete samples of these candidates and to comprehensively understand the population of monster galaxies in the early universe .",
    "observations with the _ atacama large millimeter array _ will also be crucial in discriminating between dust - enshrouded star - formation and obscured agn activity as well as providing an independent estimate of the dynamical masses of the most massive galaxies through measurements of the kinematics in these systems .",
    "finally , current x - ray data are inconclusive as to whether the non - detection of c1 - 23152 in the x - ray is due to observational flux limitations or a compton - thick nature of the agn hosted in c1 - 23152 . in order to constrain the column density of x - ray absorbing matter , and hence whether the agn is compton - thick , observations in both soft and hard bands are necessary .",
    "_ the nuclear spectroscopic telescope array mission _ ( nustar ; @xcite ) will provide an opportunity to attempt addressing this issue .",

    "<S> we present the first spectroscopic confirmation of an ultra - massive galaxy at redshift @xmath0 using data from keck - nirspec , vlt - x - shooter , and gtc - osiris . </S>",
    "<S> we detect strong [ oiii ] and ly@xmath1 emission , and weak [ oii ] , civ , and heii , placing c1 - 23152 at a spectroscopic redshift of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the modeling of the emission - line corrected spectral energy distribution results in a best - fit stellar mass of @xmath3 m@xmath4 , a star - formation rate of @xmath57  m@xmath4  yr@xmath6 , and negligible dust extinction . </S>",
    "<S> the stars appear to have formed in a short intense burst @xmath7300 - 500 myr prior to the observation epoch , setting the formation redshift of this galaxy at z@xmath74.1 . from the analysis of the line ratios and widths , and the observed flux at 24@xmath8 m </S>",
    "<S> , we confirm the presence of a luminous hidden active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , with bolometric luminosity of @xmath9 erg s@xmath6 . potential contamination of the observed sed from the agn continuum is constrained , placing a lower limit on the stellar mass of @xmath10  m@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> hst / wfc3 h@xmath11 and acs i@xmath12 images are modeled , resulting in an effective radius of @xmath13 kpc in the h@xmath11 band and a srsic index @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> this object may be a prototype of the progenitors of local most massive elliptical galaxies in the first 2 gyr of cosmic history , having formed most of its stars at @xmath15 in a highly dissipative , intense , and short burst of star formation . </S>",
    "<S> c1 - 23152 is completing its transition to a post - starburst phase while hosting a powerful agn , potentially responsible for the quenching of the star formation activity . </S>"
