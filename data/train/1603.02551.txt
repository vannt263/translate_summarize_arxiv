    ", the engine must work reversibly ( infinitely slowly ) and thus its output power is vanishingly small .",
    "optimization of the power of _ irreversible _ carnot cycles working under finite - time conditions was pioneered by yvon @xcite , novikov @xcite , chambadal @xcite and later by curzon and ahlborn @xcite .",
    "although the obtained result for the efficiency at maximum power ( emp ) , @xmath5 , is not universal , neither it represents a bound on the emp @xcite , its close agreement with emp for several model systems @xcite ignited search for universalities in performance of heat engines .    up to the second order in @xmath4 the emp , @xmath6 ,",
    "is controlled by the symmetries of the underlying dynamics @xcite .",
    "further universalities were obtained for the heat engines working in the low - dissipation regime @xcite , where the work dissipated during the isothermal branches of the carnot cycle grows in inverse proportion to the duration of these branches . in this regime ,",
    "a general expression for the emp has been published @xcite and , subsequently , esposito et al .",
    "derived the bounds @xmath7 on the emp @xcite .",
    "all these results were confirmed within the framework of irreversible thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "recently , increased attention has been given to the optimization of heat engines which does not work at maximum power @xcite .",
    "such studies are important for engineering practice , where not only powerful , but also economical devices should be developed .",
    "indeed , it was already highlighted @xcite that actual thermal plants and heat engines should not work at the maximum power @xmath8 , where the corresponding efficiency @xmath6 can be relatively small , but rather in a regime with slightly smaller power @xmath9 and considerably larger efficiency @xmath10 .    in the present paper",
    ", we introduce universal bounds on maximum efficiency at a given power for low - dissipation heat engines ( ldhes ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 we derive these bounds analytically for small @xmath13 and for @xmath13 close to @xmath14 . for the intermediate regime",
    "we present strong numerical evidence that the bounds are valid for any @xmath13 .",
    "the inequalities ( [ eq : deta_bounds ] ) represent direct generalization of the bounds on emp obtained for @xmath15 by esposito et al . @xcite . in the leading order in @xmath16 , the left and the right bound coincide and the resulting maximum efficiency , @xmath17 , equals to that obtained using linear response theory in the strong coupling limit @xcite .",

    "another usual assumption , that we also adopt here , is that the duration of the adiabatic branches is short compared to @xmath28 and thus the cycle duration can be well approximated by @xmath29 .",
    "the heat absorbed by the system during the hot isotherm , @xmath30 , and the heat delivered to the cold reservoir during the cold isotherm , @xmath31 , are given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the change of the system entropy during the hot isotherm .",

    "close to maximum power , this gain scales as a square root from the relative loss of power @xmath13 ( [ eq : deta_small_a ] ) .",
    "this scaling is a direct consequence of the fact that power has maximum at @xmath22 and thus it is universal for a broad class of systems .",
    "indeed , the same scaling of maximum efficiency with the relative loss of power has been found recently for several models @xcite .",
    "our results thus support the general statement about actual heat engines with quantitative arguments and reveal more practical limits on efficiency than the reversible one",
    ".    it would be interesting to investigate maximum gain in efficiency for a fixed power also for other models , such as endoreversible heat engines , or systems described by general markov dynamics , i.e. by a master equation , to see whether the behavior would be qualitatively the same as that obtained here and in the studies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one can ask if the functional form of the prefactor @xmath144 in the formula for the gain in efficiency @xmath145 is controlled by similar symmetries of the underlying dynamics as the emp @xcite",
    ". it would be also immensely interesting to find a heat engine where the square root scaling of the maximum gain in efficiency close to maximum power would not be valid .",
