    "the structure and dynamics of sheets or surfaces are important in diverse contexts in everyday life , in cell biology , in field theory and quantum gravity , and in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "previous studies have concentrated on idealized surfaces - the thickness is neglected principally to facilitate an analytical approach ( see the excellent work by david , duplantier , guitter and wiese , reviewed in ref.@xcite ) or partially captured by tethering together , in a two dimensional array , hard spheres , whose diameter equals the surface thickness . in the latter case ,",
    "both the steric and interactions induced by the environment or solvent are modeled as standard two - body potentials which become singular ( dirac delta function ) interactions in the continuum limit @xcite . in this limit ,",
    "self - interacting manifolds , in 1 dimension corresponding to a polymer chain and in 2 dimensions corresponding to a membrane , the subject of our study , can not be correctly described by two body interactions @xcite .",
    "the difficulty arises because a pair - wise interaction can only depend on the distance between the two parts of the manifold .",
    "one is unable to account for whether these two parts are near each other just because they lie on adjacent parts of the manifold or whether they are distant along the manifold and thence truly interacting .",
    "one could cure this problem by introducing some microscopic cut - off such that nearby parts of the manifold , at a distance smaller than this cut - off along the manifold , are defined to be non - interacting .",
    "this procedure is expected not to affect the long distance behavior but it affects many important intermediate scale effects of interest .",
    "extensive studies @xcite have shown that there are vastly different behaviors between a conventional polymer modeled as a chain of non - overlapping spheres and a tube due distinct symmetries in the two cases .",
    "the latter can be imagined as a chain of coins whose symmetry is cylindrical .",
    "self - avoidance of a flexible tube can be imposed by using a three - body potential @xcite .",
    "a tube subject to maximal compaction takes on the geometry of an optimal helix @xcite , whose local curvature is equal to the tube thickness . strikingly , this geometry is adopted by @xmath0-helices in proteins . on the other hand ,",
    "a fcc lattice is an optimal arrangement for a chain of spheres subject to compaction , provided the tether constraints do not conflict with this arrangement .",
    "surprisingly , chains of overlapping spheres @xcite behave in a manner akin to a tube .",
    "this is because the overlap between adjacent spheres along the chain result in a loss of spherical symmetry and endow an anisotropy to the chain much as a tube does @xcite .",
    "the principal theme of this paper is to introduce a model of a thick hydrophobic membrane that encapsulates the correct symmetry associated with its intrinsic two dimensional nature .",
    "the implementation of the non - zero thickness of the membrane is carried out through a four - body potential @xcite . unlike the model of tethered spheres ,",
    "the membrane thickness in our model provides a length scale that is independent of the discretization of the membrane surface , and thus is free of the singularity problem in the continuum limit .",
    "the interaction with the solvent molecules is captured through hadwiger s theorem @xcite as explained in @xcite : the effective self - interactions of the membrane , induced by a short - range solvent - membrane potential , can have only four distinct contributions .",
    "two of these interactions are proportional to the integrals of the mean curvature and gaussian curvature over the entire surface .",
    "the other two interactions pertain to an entropic contribution arising from the volume excluded to the solvent molecules @xcite and an energy contribution measured by the area of the membrane that is exposed to the solvent molecules .",
    "the membrane thickness already takes into account the mean curvature effects because , at each position on the surface , the curvature radii have to be larger than the thickness itself .",
    "the integral of the gaussian curvature is constant if the membrane topology is kept fixed .",
    "furthermore , because the membranes we consider are open , the volume excluded to the solvent molecules is partly taken into account by the buried area or equivalently by its complement , the exposed area .",
    "thus our focus here is on understanding how the area of the membrane exposed to the solvent molecules influences the nature of the conformations of a hydrophobic membrane immersed in a solvent .",
    "we show that distinct behaviors are obtained for different ratios between the membrane thickness and the solvent molecule size , both in the absence and presence of an inert wall , which serves to shield one side of the membrane from the solvent .",
    "we find several familiar conformations that have not been observed in previous studies of conventional models .",
    "the notion of thickness can be introduced for a continuum surface in 3-d .",
    "the position vector of a point on the surface is given by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 defines the local ( curvilinear ) coordinate frame on the surface .",
    "the two tangent vectors are @xmath3 the square of the distance between two neighboring positions on the surface , @xmath4 , @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the metric tensor .",
    "we will assume that the tangent vectors are linearly independent at all points on the surface which is equivalent to @xmath8 the surface element at position @xmath4 is given by @xmath9 we also assume that the local coordinate frame is chosen such that the normal to the surface @xmath10 is always on one side of the surface .",

    "wrinkled rigid structures have been observed experimentally upon cooling partially polymerized phospholipid membranes @xcite and have been interpreted as resulting from quenched curvature disorder leading to a glassy phase .",
    "studies of wrinkled patterns of polymer films @xcite have indicated that thickness plays a role in the formation of these patterns .",
    "we note that the our study considers paint brush sizes in two distinct regimes : smaller than or larger than the membrane thickness .",
    "membranes thicker than the size of a water molecule ( @xmath85 ) are quite common .",
    "the other limit is obtained when the role of solvent is played by large complexes such as proteins ( 3 - 10 nm ) , t - rna ( 7 nm ) , antibodies ( 12 nm ) and ribosomes ( 20 - 30 nm ) .",
    "interestingly , for a relatively dilute concentration of these complexes , even of the order of 10% in volume fraction according to asakura - oosawa theory @xcite , the entropy depletion effect alone is sufficient to create a tendency to fold the membrane leading to minimization of the exposed area .",
