    "the contact process ( cp ) is known as a simple model for epidemic spreading that mimics the interplay of local infections and recovery of individuals  @xcite .",
    "it is defined on a @xmath0-dimensional lattice whose sites could be either active ( infected ) or inactive ( non - infected ) , denoted as 1 and 0 , respectively .",
    "the model evolves random - sequentially by two competing processes , namely , nearest - neighbor infections @xmath1 , and spontaneous recovery @xmath2 .",
    "depending on the relative frequency of these moves the contact process displays a continuous phase transition from a fluctuating active state into an absorbing state which belongs to the universality class of directed percolation ( dp )  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate a generalized version of the one - dimensional contact process where inactive sites can be activated over long distances .",
    "we consider a lattice model where sites could be either active or non - active .",
    "the model evolves by random sequential updating with the following transition rates : @xmath3 the first move corresponds to the usual local annihilation process , while the second move describes a long range process in which an inactive site which is located at a distance @xmath4 from the nearest active one becomes active .",
    "the rate at which such a process takes place decays algebraically with the distance @xmath4 from the nearest active site ( measured in lattice site units ) , reflecting the long range nature of the interaction .",
    "the overall rate of this process is governed by the control parameter @xmath5 , while the characteristic shape of the interaction is controlled by the exponent @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , usual short range dynamics is recovered in the limit @xmath7 . in what follows",
    "we refer to this model as the @xmath6-process .",
    "note that its definition is valid in any dimension although we are primarily interested in the one - dimensional case .     long - range infections in the generalized one - dimensional contact process .",
    "any site between two active sites can be activated with a rate proportional to @xmath8 , where @xmath4 is the distance to the nearest active site .",
    "the model is motivated by the dynamics of a fluctuating interface growing on an inert substrate ( see text ) .",
    ", width=430 ]    the long - range contact process investigated here is motivated by recent studies of depinning transitions in non - equilibrium wetting processes  @xcite , where one considers a fluctuating interface next to a hard - core wall . regarding the pinned domains of the interface as active sites and unpinned domains as inactive ones ,",
    "the dynamics of the fluctuating interface may be projected onto that of a contact process ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : interface ] ) .",
    "for example , unpinning of the interface due to deposition would correspond to spontaneous recovery @xmath9 , while lateral growth of a pinned domain would correspond to local spreading of activity by @xmath10 .",
    "however , as unpinned regions of the interface fluctuate in the bulk they may spontaneously become pinned to the substrate far away from other binding sites .",
    "as illustrated in the figure , such a pinning effectively leads to long - range infections in the corresponding contact process .",
    "clearly , the rate for pinning will decrease as we move away from the binding site .",
    "numerical studies of some wetting models ( not shown in this work ) indicate that this rate decays algebraically as @xmath8 with an exponent @xmath11 .",
    "this motivates the postulated power law in eq .",
    "( [ process3 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless the relation between non - equilibrium wetting and the @xmath6-process should be considered as an analogy , rather than an exact mapping , because the projection neglects the internal dynamics of unpinned regions of the interface .    in recent years",
    "the contact process has also been generalized in various other ways to include long - range infections  @xcite . in these studies",
    "it is assumed that a given active site can activate _ any _ other site with a probability @xmath12 , which decays algebraically with the distance @xmath13 as @xmath14 in such models the infection can be thought of as being spread by lvy flights  @xcite .",
    "solved this problem using field - theoretic renormalization group calculations  @xcite .",
    "the results of this analysis is in agreement with numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "more recently these studies have been extended to contact processes with temporal  @xcite and spatio - temporal lvy flights  @xcite as well as to systems with disorder  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6-process studied in the present work differs from lvy - flight - mediated contact process . here",
    "an inactive site can only be activated by the nearest active site .",
    "therefore , in one space dimension , the interaction range is effectively cut off by half the actual size of the corresponding island of inactive sites .",
    "thus infections in the @xmath6-process are mediated by _ truncated _ lvy flights , which can not overtake other active sites . as will be shown below , this",
    "truncation changes the critical properties at the transition significantly .",
    "in particular , although both models exhibit critical exponents which vary with @xmath6 , the exponents themselves are not the same . moreover , while in the lvy flights model the exponents become mean - field like for small @xmath6 @xcite no such regime exists in the @xmath6-process .    in the following section we analyze the @xmath6-process by a mean - field approximation as well as numerical simulations and compare it to contact processes with unrestricted lvy flights . in sect .",
    "[ sec : sigma ] we further generalize the model by taking the rate for nearest - neighbor infection to depend on the distance to the nearest active site .",
    "this rate is controlled by an additional exponent @xmath15 .",
    "the phase diagram of this generalized model , called @xmath6-@xmath15-process , is then studied by mean - field and numerical methods .",
    "conclusions are finally presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ]",
    "we now consider the @xmath6-process within a mean - field approximation in terms of the density of active sites @xmath16 . to this end",
    "the mean - field equation of the ordinary contact process has to be extended by a term that accounts for long - range infections according to eq .",
    "( [ process3 ] ) . assuming that the sites of a one - dimensional lattice are uncorrelated and independently active with probability @xmath17 , it is easy to check that the probability of an inactive site to lie at a distance @xmath4 from the nearest active site is @xmath18 . summing up the contributions for all distances @xmath4 ,",
    "the mean - field equation governing the dynamics of the density of active sites takes the form @xmath19 where the first term appearing on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ mfalpha1 ] ) corresponds to the short range annihilation process .",
    "note that the usual dp short range activation term is given by the first term of the sum in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ mfalpha1 ] ) + turning the sum into an integral the leading terms in @xmath17 in the dynamical equation ( [ mfalpha1 ] ) may be evaluated .",
    "it is found that for @xmath20 and , to leading order in @xmath17 , eq . ( [ mfalpha1 ] ) becomes @xmath21 where @xmath22 are constants and @xmath23 . since the leading term in this equation is @xmath24 , and since its coefficient is positive , the absorbing state @xmath25 is always unstable and no transition takes place for any finite @xmath5 .",
    "this is also the case for @xmath26 , where logarithmic corrections to the leading linear terms destabilize the absorbing phase .",
    "+ on the other hand , for @xmath27 the leading term in the equation is the linear one . moreover",
    "the coefficient @xmath28 of the leading non - linear term is negative .",
    "this results in a continuous transition to the absorbing state which takes place at @xmath29 corresponding to a non - vanishing rate @xmath5 .",
    "such a phase transition belongs to a universality class different from the one of the short range dp model .",
    "for example , in the stationary state the density of active sites scales as @xmath30 hence the mean - field order parameter exponent , @xmath31 , varies continuously with @xmath6 .",
    "it diverges in the limit @xmath32 . for @xmath33 , however , the leading non - linear term is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a negative constant .",
    "the mean - field equation thus reduces to that of the short range dp process , and usual dp - like transition is expected .",
    "thus @xmath36    before discussing the results of the numerical study of this model we consider a more refined mean - field approximation , where the effect of the long - range process on the diffusion constant is taken into account . to proceed",
    "we assume that , although the dynamical process is long range , it does not modify the usual laplacian form of the spatial interactions , @xmath37 .",
    "the reason is that the infection range in the @xmath6model is cut - off by the maximal distance to the nearest active site , making it effectively of finite range .",
    "however , as we shall see below , the effect of the @xmath6 infection process is to make the diffusion coefficient @xmath38 dependent on the density @xmath17 .    in order to evaluate @xmath39",
    "we note that the infection process is cut off at length - scales @xmath40 , which is the average distance between active particles in a system with density @xmath17 .",
    "the mean square displacement of an infection is expected to scale as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a cutoff due to lattice spacing from which the usual constant contribution @xmath43 ( positive for @xmath44 ) to the diffusion coefficient arises . since @xmath45 , eq .",
    "( [ l2 ] ) suggests that the effective diffusion constant diverges for @xmath46 .",
    "thus the space - time - dependent version of the mean - field equation for @xmath47 reads to lowest order @xmath48^\\alpha + [ \\rho(\\xvec , t)]^{\\alpha-3}\\nabla^2\\rho(\\xvec , t).\\ ] ] for this equation , dimensional analysis yields the complete set of mean - field exponents @xmath49 where as usual @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the mean - field values for the spatial and temporal exponents which control the power - law divergence of correlations ( respectively in space and time ) at criticality .    on the other hand for @xmath52",
    "the non - linear term in the dynamical equation @xmath53 becomes @xmath54 while the diffusion coefficient remains singular at @xmath55 .",
    "this implies that the dp regime sets up only for @xmath56 , and not for @xmath57 as suggested by the analysis of the reaction terms alone . in particular",
    ", for @xmath58 lowest order mean - field reads @xmath59 ^ 2 + [ \\rho(\\xvec , t)]^{\\alpha-3}\\nabla^2\\rho(\\xvec , t).\\ ] ] and by dimensional analysis one gets @xmath60 for the dynamical exponent @xmath61 , we obtain @xmath62 in the following we compare these values with the results of extensive numerical simulations .      in order to determine the critical exponents numerically , we performed monte - carlo simulations of the one - dimensional @xmath6-process with periodic boundary conditions , starting with a fully occupied lattice . the time step @xmath63 of a single move in the random sequential updating procedure has been taken as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the lattice size .",
    "+ for models with long - range interactions such simulations are difficult to perform because of strong finite - size effects , which increase as @xmath32 . in the present model",
    "these finite - size effects manifest themselves by sudden transitions into the absorbing state .",
    "this leads to uncontrollable fluctuations in the statistical averages . to circumvent this problem we combined finite size scaling analysis with numerical simulations .",
    "the simulations were carried out on large systems with homogeneous initial states approaching the critical point from the active phase . + the critical point @xmath66 and the dynamical exponent @xmath67 have been determined by finite size analysis of the average absorbing time @xmath68 for an initially fully occupied lattice . at the critical point",
    "@xmath68 is expected to scale with the system size @xmath65 as @xmath69 for one dimensional systems belonging to the dp universality class the dynamical exponent is known to be @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "we also measured the exponent @xmath71 , which is associated with the temporal decay of the density @xmath17 of active sites at criticality .",
    "this calculation has been performed by applying the method of finite  size analysis proposed by de oliveira and dickman  @xcite : whenever the system falls into the absorbing state the dynamical process is recovered by automatically resetting the system into a `` typical '' active configuration . in practice , this procedure suppresses the large fluctuations which result from the abrupt transitions to the absorbing state in finite systems .",

    "usually , large fluctuations make the latter method quite inaccurate and time consuming . in order to obtain better performances we carried out numerical simulations of large systems ( @xmath83 ) and over long time lapses ( @xmath84 time steps ) , while averaging over a few different realizations .",
