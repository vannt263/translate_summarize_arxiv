    "the lagrangian for pure su(3 ) yang - mills theory does not include a mass scale . at the classical level ,",
    "conformal invariance of pure gauge theories is the expression of this lack of scale .",
    "however , the corresponding quantum theory gets a mass , let us say @xmath1 , from the loop contributions via dimensional transmutation .    at the level of the lagrangian a gluon mass term",
    "is forbidden by gauge invariance and , as long as the color symmetry is unbroken , the gluon is supposed to be massless . certainly , in what concerns the perturbative solution of qcd , within the framework of the faddeev - popov quantization procedure @xcite , the gluon is massless .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , a dynamical generated mass which is a function of the momentum is allowed if one goes beyond perturbation theory .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", a non - vanishing gluon mass is welcome to regularize infrared divergences and to solve some problems related with unitarity . on the other side",
    ", diffractive phenomena @xcite and inclusive radiative decays of @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite suggest a massive gluon . moreover , lattice simulations suggest an infrared gluon hard mass of @xmath4 mev @xcite and an ultraviolet mass @xmath5 gev @xcite . phenomenology favors a gluon mass between @xmath6 gev and @xmath7 gev depending on how the mass is defined  see table 15 in @xcite",
    "furthermore , a dynamically generated gluon mass can be related with the presence of the @xmath8 gluon condensate , which is associated with the non - perturbative sector of qcd and whose role has been investigated by several authors - see , for example , @xcite and references their in .",
    "the idea of a gluon mass was explored by different authors @xcite .",
    "starting from the dyson - schwinger equations ( dse ) for the gluon and ghost propagators , after a suitable truncation scheme , the equations were solved and the transverse part of the gluon propagator described by a massive type propagator , i.e. @xmath9 with a a momentum dependent gluon mass @xmath10 , called below running mass gluon , and a running dressing function @xmath11 .",
    "typically , the numerical solution for the propagator is fitted to a functional form @xmath12 copied from the solution discussed in @xcite .",
    "the solutions of the dse give a @xmath13 which takes its largest value at zero momentum , where @xmath14 mev , and vanishes for @xmath15 .",
    "in this way , the usual perturbative propagator is recovered at high momentum .",
    "the dyson - schwinger studies referred to in the above paragraph rely on the faddeev - popov quantization method , whose validity for investigating non - perturbative effects in qcd is under debate - see , for example , @xcite and references therein .",
    "however , a running gluon mass was also found within the studies of the non - perturbative quantization of yang - mills theories . in particular , in the framework of the so - called refined gribov - zwanziger action @xcite , a tree level propagator was computed suggesting a functional form for @xmath13 which is close to the original proposal of cornwall @xcite .",
    "besides the solutions of the dyson - schwinger equations , lattice simulations also provide support for a non - vanishing gluon mass , see for example @xcite .",
    "the precise value for @xmath13 depends on how the gluon propagator is modeled .",
    "for example , in lattice qcd or dyson - schwinger calculations , a running mass is computed fitting the propagator to a given functional form for @xmath13 . in this work we use lattice qcd simulations to investigate @xmath16 .",
    "besides checking the compatibility of the lattice data with theoretical predictions for @xmath16 , a first attempt is made to compute the running gluon mass directly from lattice simulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ definicoes ]",
    "we describe the lattice setup , the cuts performed to produce a unique curve for the gluon propagator and the renormalization procedure .",
    "the gluon mass is investigated in section [ mass_gluao ] considering three different scenarios . before considering the running mass , we consider constant mass ansatze to fit the propagator for the infrared ( section [ section_hadr_ir ] ) and the ultraviolet momenta ( section [ section_hadr_uv ] ) .",
    "we find that the gluon propagator can not be fully fitted with a constant gluon mass , and thus we proceed with fitting the gluon propagator with a running mass gluon and a running gluon dressing function ( [ section_run_m ] ) .",
    "finally , in section [ fim ] we resume the results of section [ mass_gluao ] and comment on its interpretation .",
    "the propagator ( vertical axis ) is given in gev@xmath17 and the momenta ( horizontal axis ) in gev . ]    in this paper we consider four dimensional su(3 ) wilson action lattice simulations at @xmath18 .",
    "for this @xmath19 value the lattice spacing , measured from the string tension @xcite , is given by @xmath20 fm or , equivalently , @xmath21 gev .",
    "the gauge configurations were generated with the milc code @xcite .",
    "each configuration , sampled with the wilson action , was rotated to the landau gauge , as described in @xcite , using for gauge fixing the overrelaxation algorithm .",
    "the gauge fixing process requires a maximization of a given functional over the gauge orbit of each configuration .",
    "the maximization process was stopped when the lattice tetra - divergence @xcite , averaged per site , become smaller than @xmath22 .",
    "the set of lattices considered in the present work are summarized in table [ tab_lattices ] .    in the landau gauge ,",
    "the gluon propagator is given by @xmath23 latin letters stand for color indices and greek letters for space - time indices .",
    "the momentum space gluon field @xmath24 definition and how to compute the form factor @xmath25 are described in @xcite and will not be repeated here .    for the continuum momentum",
    "we take the standard definition @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the lattice spacing and @xmath28 the number of lattice points in direction @xmath29 .    in the following only renormalized data",
    "will be considered .",
    "the renormalization was performed fitting , for each lattice simulation , the bare lattice propagator to the one - loop inspired result @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the gluon anomalous dimension . for the fits to equation ( [ fit_uv ] ) , the largest momentum range , starting at @xmath32 and going up to @xmath33 gev , with the @xmath34 closer to unity was used  see table [ tab_z ] . from the fits we extracted the constants @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which enabled the computation of the renormalization constant @xmath37 via @xmath38 after requiring the renormalized propagator to be given by @xmath39 as renormalization scale it was used @xmath40 gev .    .lattice",
    "setup - the lattices considered are @xmath41 symmetric hypercubes . for conversion into physical units the lattice spacing we used @xmath20 fm , or @xmath21 gev , as computed from the string tension @xcite . [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > \" , ]     for the functional forms",
    "( [ m_dse_sof ] ) and ( [ m_dse_simp ] ) , the parameters are computed fitting the lattice data via minimization of the @xmath42 for both expressions , we were not able to fit all momenta range .",
    "this can be understood looking at the propagator data in ultraviolet region . indeed , for large momenta , the statistical errors on the lattice propagator are quite small and the minimization process is constraint mainly by these points .",
    "further , the renormalization process does not eliminate all the artifacts associated the finite lattice spacing .",
    "indeed , a closer look at the propagator show that for @xmath43 gev and above , the propagators fluctuates slightly .",
    "given the small statistical errors , this makes extremely difficult to fit the data unless the fluctuations are removed as , for example , in @xcite .",
    "instead of smoothing our lattice data , we fitted ( [ m_dse_sof ] ) and ( [ m_dse_simp ] ) from @xmath44 up to @xmath45 , where @xmath45 was defined as the maximum momentum window where @xmath46 .    ) and ( [ m_dse_simp ] ) . ]",
    "the fits are reported in table [ tab_dse ] .",
    "our first comment being that the fits are not able to distinguish between the two functional forms ( [ m_dse_sof ] ) and ( [ m_dse_simp ] ) .",
    "the two functional forms describe quite well the lattice propagator in the nonperturbative region , i.e. from zero momentum up to @xmath47 gev .",
    "furthermore , the region which they are able to describe increases with the lattice volume .",
    "the exception being the smallest lattice , where the good fit for a relatively large @xmath45 is related to the smaller number of @xmath48 , which makes the fit easier to perform .",
    "in the infrared region , ( [ m_dse_sof ] ) and ( [ m_dse_simp ] ) reduce to a massive type propagator whose mass is given by the mass parameter @xmath49 .",
    "looking at the infrared mass computed in section [ section_hadr_ir ] , see table [ tab_fits_mhard ] , it follows that the hard infrared effective gluon mass is slightly smaller than @xmath49 .",
    "however , @xmath49 is , within one standard deviation , compatible with the extrapolated infrared mass of 723(11 ) mev .",
    "looking at @xmath49 obtained from the dse equations , it turns out that their @xmath49 is slightly smaller than the numbers reported here .",
    "for example , in @xcite the authors get for @xmath50 mev .",
    "note , however , that our definition does not match exactly their definition .",
    "the volume dependence of the various parameters can be seen in figure [ fig_dse_fits ] .",
    "@xmath49 is well described by a linear function of @xmath51 , which can be used to extrapolate @xmath49 to infinite volume .",
    "the extrapolation to @xmath52 gives @xmath53 mev , for a @xmath54 .",
    "the extrapolated value is closer to the estimated infrared hard mass measured directly from the lattice data measured in section [ section_hadr_ir ] and to the dse estimate for @xmath49 reported in @xcite . for the remaining parameters , it is not clear which functional form should be used to extrapolate to infinite volume and , in the following , we quote the value computed from the largest lattice .",
    "note that all the points for @xmath55 , @xmath36 and @xmath56 in figure [ fig_dse_fits ] are compatible within two standard deviations .",
    "function from @xmath57 lattice data and corresponding using for the mass squared the definition ( [ m_dse_simp ] ) . ]    ) from the fits to the largest lattice volume . ]    from the previous analysis one can conclude that the functional forms used to described the gluon propagator from the decoupling solution of the dyson - schwinger also describe the lattice data .",
    "furthermore , they provide a definition for a dynamical generated gluon mass .",
    "the renormalized gluon propagator and corresponding @xmath58 function for the @xmath57 lattice , together with the fits using ( [ m_dse_simp ] ) to parameterize the running gluon mass , are plotted in figure [ fig_dse_80_fit ] .",
    "figure [ fig_dse_z_m2 ] show the corresponding fitted dressing function and gluon mass .",
    "in this work we have investigated if the landau gauge lattice gluon propagator can be described by a massive type propagator . for the gluon mass itself ,",
    "three different scenarios were considered : i ) a constant infrared mass ; ii ) a constant ultraviolet mass ; iii ) a running mass in association with a running gluon dressing function .",
    "the mass was measured from the momentum space gluon propagator given by equation ( [ dmassive ] ) .",
    "the interpretation of the infrared lattice gluon propagator as a massive propagator with constant @xmath59 and @xmath60 was studied in section [ section_hadr_ir ] .",
    "our results show that the lattice data is compatible with such a picture for momenta up to @xmath0 mev , with an effective gluon mass around 650 - 700 mev . if the zero momentum gluon propagator is included in the data sets , then the measured @xmath61 and @xmath62 mev . on the other hand ,",
    "if one removes @xmath63 from the analysis , @xmath64 and the effective gluon becomes slightly higher @xmath65 mev .",
    "the measured infrared hard mass reproduces the results reported in @xcite for su(3 ) simulations and is consistent with the quoted infrared mass value estimated for su(2 ) in @xcite , where an @xmath59 of 0.69(3 ) gev or 0.68(4 ) gev , depending if one includes or not include @xmath63 on the analysis , was claimed .",
    "furthermore , the gluon masses claimed above agree well with the estimate of the gluon mass from the gluon condensate @xmath8 obtained in @xcite , where the value 625(33 ) mev was obtained , and is well within the interval of values estimated from phenomenology @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the lattice gluon propagator as massive type propagator with a constant mass for the ultraviolet region was checked in section [ section_hadr_uv ] .",
    "it turns out that the lattice data can not be fitted consistently by such a propagator .",
    "@xmath66 depends on the fitting range @xmath67 $ ] and , for each @xmath45 , @xmath66 is not constant .",
    "this means that , in the ultraviolet , the lattice gluon propagator does not behave as a massive bosonic propagator with a non - vanishing constant mass .",
    "the case of a running gluon mass @xmath16 and a running dressing function @xmath11 was studied in section [ section_run_m ] .",
    "several definitions for @xmath16 together with @xmath11 where investigated .",
    "in general , it turns out that @xmath66 is a decreasing function of @xmath68 . of course , the precise value for @xmath16 depends on the chosen definition for @xmath11 and vice - versa .",
    "here we considered two cases for the dressing function which allow for the computation of the running mass : ( i ) a nave extension of the perturbative dressing function towards the infrared , keeping @xmath11 always finite ; ( ii ) the functional forms for @xmath16 and @xmath11 used to fit the so - called decoupling type solution of the gluon - ghost dyson - schwinger equations .",
    "our first computation of the gluon running mass considered a parameterization of the running dressing function which extended the perturbative @xmath60 towards the infrared region , while keeping @xmath11 finite for all momenta .",
    "the gluon mass defined in this way , @xmath69 is shown in figure [ fig_m2_ext_pert ] .",
    "@xmath13 runs from @xmath7 gev for @xmath70 down to zero for @xmath71 mev .",
    "we would like to call the reader attention , that if instead of using the results reported in table [ tab_extended_pert ] for the larger fitting range , we used the results for the smallest fitting range , the values for @xmath72 would be reduced , starting below 1 gev for the smallest momentum . however , the qualitative behavior will be similar to that observed in figure [ fig_m2_ext_pert ] .    after investigating @xmath69 ,",
    "we have checked the compatibility between the functional forms used to described the decoupling type solution of the dyson - schwinger equations for the gluon propagator and the lattice propagators .",
    "these functional forms provide a parametrization of the gluon propagator and a definition for the running gluon mass .",
    "moreover , they take into account the perturbative qcd predictions for the ultraviolet regime .",
    "the functional forms are able to describe quite well the lattice data over the entire non - perturbative regime .",
    "the lattice data can be fitted by the expressions considered in the present work from @xmath44 up to @xmath45 , with @xmath45 increasing with the lattice volume . for our largest volume @xmath73 gev .",
    "for momenta above @xmath74 gev the remaining lattice spacing effects prevent a fit to the data .    in what concerns the gluon mass",
    ", we found that it is well described by @xmath75 with @xmath53 mev .",
    "our estimation of @xmath49 agrees well with the estimation performed using the dse and with is , within errors , compatible with the infrared hard mass when the @xmath63 was included in the analysis .    from the above results it follows that the interpretation of the gluon propagator as a massive type propagator with a momentum dependent mass and dressing function fits , quite well , the lattice qcd data .",
    "the gluon mass is a decreasing function of @xmath76 and becomes massless in the ultraviolet region .",
    "the nature of the gluon mass helps in the understanding of the remarkable mechanism of confinement , where the gluon mass may contribute to a meissner - type effect in qcd .",
    "moreover , given that one can define an effective gluon mass , it follows that the @xmath8 should be taken into account when investigating the non - perturbative dynamics of qcd .",
