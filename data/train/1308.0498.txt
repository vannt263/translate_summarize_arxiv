    "we note that the _ time shift relation _ between causal and non - causal pressure data holds only approximately , but in principle the non - causal data can be calculated from the causal one . however the use of the _ time shift relation _ is less computational expensive and , in addition , it explains the successful use of the non - causal thermo - viscous wave equation .",

    "similar imaging functionals were considered for non - causal and causal data , respectively , and a result analogous to  ( [ approxf ] ) was shown via approximation in the frequency - space domain .",
    "one goal of this paper is to get an expression for a reasonable imaging functional without cutting off frequencies or wave vectors , because the cut off values are not known in general .",
