    "the adsorption of polymers on flat and homogeneous attractive surfaces has been the subject of many investigations , see e.g.  @xcite , but naturally occurring surfaces usually are rough and/or energetically inhomogeneous , the heterogeneity leading to an enhancement of adsorption under quite general conditions @xcite : already simple physical arguments contain the statement that upon increasing the surface irregularity , the number of polymer - surface interactions is strongly enhanced relative to the idealized planar surface ( see figure [ fig : flory1 ] ) .",
    "this is a consequence of a larger probability of polymer - surface intersection with increasing roughness .",
    "the study presented here is partly motivated by the theoretical investigation of reinforcement mechanisms in carbon black filled elastomers , where the polymer adsorption is substantial as there is a strong binding of the polymers to the surface ( leading to a layer of localized polymers , the so called `` bound rubber '' @xcite ) .",
    "these surfaces are rough and even fractal on many decades of their size , down to the molecular size range , as well as highly energetically ( i.e.  chemically ) heterogeneous : the distribution of interaction strengths can be characterized by high energy sites surrounding a relatively low energy background . therefore in principle both kinds of disorder should be incorporated in a theory which is supposed to explain the bound rubber phenomenon .    in the literature",
    "so far spatial and energetical heterogeneities were always treated separately . in this paper",
    "we want to present a treatment which covers both sorts of surface heterogeneity , thereby making possible a comparison concerning the strength of adsorption enhancement .",
    "thus the general aim of the present paper is to produce a theory for the adsorption and localization of polymers on such surfaces .",
    "this is a nontrivial problem . for flat surfaces the description of ideal polymers by schrdinger type equations",
    "is regarded as the method of choice , but for rough surfaces this method can not be used in general , because the equations can be solved only for some highly specific boundary conditions , e.g. , regular fractal surfaces @xcite . here",
    "we want to investigate the polymer behavior near surfaces with any type of surface disorder , as well as surfaces with a wide range of heterogeneities in the attractive potential .",
    "therefore a path integral formalism seems to be appropriate , since the surface disorder can be dealt with explicitly up to an advanced stage of the calculation and disorder averages are less difficult .    however , some technical problems appear , forcing us to restrict the investigation to an idealized model system : a single ideal polymer chain in interaction with an attractive , penetrable , infinite surface . the treatment of real chains would require field theoretical approaches @xcite which are beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the penetrability of the surface ( both sides of the surface are accessible for the polymer ) , which is of interest in the context of polymer chains at membranes or interfaces , here has to be assumed in order to avoid complex boundary conditions . in the problem of polymer adsorption on flat surfaces ,",
    "non - penetrability is relatively easy to handle : the polymers are considered in half space @xcite . for random surfaces",
    "an half space treatment is no longer possible .",
    "therefore we will loose information on the localization behavior , but nevertheless expect general insight into the problem .",
    "the results of the calculations are expressions for the size of the chain , depending on the mean interaction strength @xmath0 , the chain length @xmath1 and the disorder parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the size of the chain @xmath2 perpendicular to the surface is obtained    * in section [ scaling ] for strong spatial disorder , using a scaling argument  la de gennes @xcite  this calculation intends to give a better insight into the main mechanism of adsorption enhancement ; * in section [ vario ] for weak spatial disorder and energetically heterogeneous surfaces , using a variational calculation .    in the latter case ,",
    "first the hamiltonian is formulated which explicitly contains the surface geometry and a distribution of interaction strengths .",
    "then the free energy is approximated using a feynman variational procedure .",
    "it turns out that for our problem an extension of a trial hamiltonian introduced by garel and orland @xcite is much more suitable than the replica trial hamiltonian frequently used in connection with polymers in disordered environments @xcite . in comparison with garel and   orland ,",
    "our main modification is the separation of the monomer coupling parameter into components of different space direction , thus enabling the polymer size parallel and perpendicular to the surface normal to be distinguished .",
    "after minimization of the free energy , the effect of surface heterogeneity can be summarized in an effective interaction strength which in most cases is larger than the mean interaction strength .",
    "the variational scheme is first tested on a flat and homogeneous surface , where it is shown that the result agrees with the scaling estimate and the results given earlier @xcite for ideal chains .",
    "then the effective interaction strength is calculated for the special cases of a periodic and random distribution of interaction strength on a flat surface and for a periodic and random surface profile at constant interaction strength , respectively .",
    "this also allows us to consider the localization transition .",
    "the results are discussed and summarized in section [ conc ] .",
    "first we briefly review a simple scaling treatment of an ideal chain adsorbed on a flat surface , as introduced by de gennes @xcite .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be the mean size of an ideal polymer ( with @xmath1 monomers and effective monomer length @xmath5 ) perpendicular and parallel to the surface , respectively .",
    "the monomer density is assumed to be constant in a region of size @xmath6 .",
    "then the number @xmath7 of monomers bounded to the surface is estimated as @xmath8 consequently the free energy can be written as @xmath9 the first term being the confinement energy , the second one due to contact interactions with the surface ( @xmath10 is the effective monomer attraction , @xmath11 the inverse temperature ) .",
    "minimization of the free energy @xmath12 gives an expression for the polymer thickness @xmath2 perpendicular to the surface , @xmath13 thus the thickness of the polymer reduces with growing attractive interaction strength , as expected .",
    "the independence of the chain length @xmath1 indicates that the polymer is in the so called  localized  regime @xcite .",
    "a fractal surface may be characterized by its fractal dimension @xmath14 , @xmath15 , a value @xmath16 corresponding to a flat surface .",
    "the limit @xmath17 produces an extremely rough , space - filling surface , brownian surfaces @xcite are characterized by @xmath18 .",
    "now the number of bounded monomers is written as @xmath19 running through the same procedure as above yields @xmath20 so that the result ( [ flat ] ) for the case of a flat surface @xmath16 is recovered .    from ( [ flat ] )",
    "we have @xmath21 because of @xmath22 for weak adsorption , where no complete collapse on the surface takes place .",
    "in fact for most materials values about @xmath23 are found @xcite .",
    "therefore the polymer adsorption on rough surfaces ( @xmath24 ) generally is enhanced compared to the case of a flat surface , i.e. @xmath25 .",
    "although this is a crude argument , it gives an insight into the main aspects of adsorption enhancement : the crucial point is the competition between the gain in potential energy obtained by binding to the surface and the loss in chain entropy associated with the confinement of chains in comparison to free chains .",
    "therefore , the dominating mechanism in our consideration above is the increasing number of binding sites at a rough surface without paying an entropy penalty , which means that a chain has to lose less configurational entropy to adsorb on a rough surface .",
    "this is in agreement with results of much more expensive previous calculations by douglas et al .",
    "@xcite and hone et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a similar argument holds for the case of energetical heterogeneity @xcite : with a distribution of the interaction strength on the surface , the chain can select the strong binding points without changing its configuration too much , thus seeing a larger effective interaction strength .",
    "for a systematic study of @xmath2 in the case of spatial and energetical heterogeneity , the free energy is calculated via a variational procedure , where the disorder is treated as a quenched ( i.e.  frozen ) randomness .",
    "the replica method is avoided by introduction of an additional variational parameter , see next section .",
    "we consider an ideal chain at an infinite , penetrable , well defined surface with low profile .",
    "furthermore we assume an attractive contact ( i.e.  extremely short range ) interaction between chain and surface that can be mimicked by a delta - potential .",
    "now this system is represented by its edwards - hamiltonian , which reads @xmath26 @xmath27 being the chain segment vector position .",
    "the potential contains the polymer - surface coupling , @xmath28\\ ; b\\,w({{\\underbar{x}}})\\ ,               \\delta({\\textbf{r}}(s ) - { \\textbf{h}}({{\\underbar{x}}}))\\ ] ] with @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is an internal surface vector .",
    "the surface disorder is described by @xmath31 for energetical disorder , i.e.  an interaction strength varying on the surface , and by @xmath32 for spatial disorder , i.e.  a rough surface profile .",
    "the factor @xmath33=(1+|\\nabla h({{\\underbar{x}}})|^2)^{1/2}$ ] takes account of the local deflection of the surface in cartesian coordinates .",
    "in order to approximate the free energy we make use of a feynman variational procedure , @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the average with respect to a trial hamiltonian @xmath36 .",
    "this gives an upper bound to the free energy @xmath37 with the abbreviation @xmath38 @xmath39 has to be minimized to give the best estimate for the true free energy @xmath40 .",
    "the appropriate choice of the trial hamiltonian is most significant for the utility of the variational procedure .",
    "here we take an extension of a form suggested by garel and orland @xcite , @xmath41    its features are : ( a ) it is quadratic in @xmath27 , so that an exact calculation of @xmath42 is possible ; ( b ) the coupling of chain segments is mediated by the variational parameters @xmath43 , one for each direction of space : the indices 1 and 2 are identified with the coordinates @xmath44 and @xmath45 of the surface parameterization , index 3 corresponds to the @xmath46 coordinate parallel to the average surface normal ; ( c ) there is an additional variational parameter @xmath47 , equivalent to a translation of the centre of mass of the chain . it should be mentioned that this type of variational principle was originally designed to avoid replica theory in random systems @xcite .",
    "this is another reason why the garel - orland method is chosen here .",
    "if the polymer is assumed to stick permanently at some place along the disordered surface , the problem falls into classes dealing with `` quenched disorder '' and difficulties with replica symmetry breaking arise . in the following",
    "we will show that the garel - orland method is indeed useful to treat the problem of polymer adsorption on disordered surfaces as it yields physically sensible results .",
    "assuming cyclic boundary conditions @xmath48 , the variational free energy ( [ betaf ] ) can now be calculated to give @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "here the interaction energy @xmath51 is the only term depending on the interaction potential , @xmath52 \\ , w({{\\underbar{x}}})\\ , \\exp\\left\\ { - \\sum_{i=1}^3       { ( b_i - h_i({{\\underbar{x}}}))^2   \\over 2g_i}\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath53 being the components of @xmath54 , i.e.   @xmath55 .",
    "the parameters @xmath56 are defined by @xmath57 @xmath56 can be identified with the mean square radius of the polymer parallel ( @xmath58 ) or perpendicular ( @xmath59 , and @xmath60 ) to the surface normal .      following the lines of garel and orland , the minimization of @xmath39 with respect to @xmath61 and @xmath47 leads to @xmath62 and @xmath63 because of @xmath64 . as already discussed by garel and orland @xcite ,",
    "one does in general expect the variational equations to have several solutions .",
    "this especially applies to ( [ minb ] ) , since we consider an infinite surface , e.g.  leading to an infinite number of solutions in the case of a periodic surface heterogeneity .",
    "all these solutions have equal free energy .",
    "introducing the abbreviation @xmath65 the optimized parameter @xmath56 is calculated from ( [ ming ] ) as @xmath66         -\\displaystyle{nb^2\\over4}\\         \\displaystyle{\\cot(\\alpha_j)-\\alpha_j^{-1}\\over \\alpha_j }        & w_j^{\\text{eff } } < 0 .",
    "\\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] the effective interaction strength @xmath67 contains all relevant surface and polymer properties and is given by @xmath68 in two special cases results can be obtained very easily :    * if there is no interacting surface at all , i.e.  @xmath69 , then we immediately have @xmath70 and therefore @xmath71 , the chain conformation is purely gaussian in all directions , as expected ; * for an ideal surface , which means @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the effective interactions strengths are calculated as @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "so the definition ( [ wjdef ] ) of @xmath67 guarantees correct results for this case .    the explicit form of @xmath67 for various special sorts of surface heterogeneity is calculated in the next section .",
    "the discussion of ( [ gallgemein ] ) is complicated by the fact that the effective interaction strength itself is a function of the polymer extensions in different directions .",
    "but in general ( [ gallgemein ] ) can for @xmath76 be expanded in the limits of small and large @xmath77 .",
    "this yields the mean polymer extension into the different directions of space , @xmath78 being parallel to the surface normal , @xmath79 and @xmath80 perpendicular to it , if @xmath81 is assumed ,    @xmath82     \\displaystyle{b\\over \\beta w_j^{\\mathrm{eff } } }      \\left\\ { 1 - \\displaystyle{\\pi \\over n ( \\beta w_j^{\\text{eff}})^2}\\right\\ }       & \\beta w_j^{\\text{eff } } \\gg n^{-1/2 }           \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ]    where , as above , @xmath83 denotes the radius of gyration of the corresponding gaussian chain",
    ".    thus in the limit of small effective interaction strength the chain has gaussian conformation ( see figure [ fig : adso1 ] ) , whereas for high @xmath84 the chain is localized at the surface , leading to a mean polymer size which in lowest order shows the same characteristics as the result of the scaling argument , equation ( [ flat ] ) . from the conditions for the limiting cases ,",
    "a localization criterion @xmath85 can be found , which means @xmath86 for long chains .",
    "therefore very long chains always are adsorbed , i.e.  localized , at an attractive surface .",
    "this of course is a consequence of our assumption of a penetrable surface , since in the opposite case of impenetrable surfaces adsorption takes place only from a finite interaction strength @xcite ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath87 .    for negative effective interaction strength @xmath88 ,",
    "only the case @xmath89 is important for us , as we are mainly interested in the adsorption behavior .",

    "the variational calculation presented here is valid for weak spatial disorder only ( therefore it does not reproduce the scaling behavior for fractal surfaces ) .",
    "nevertheless the mechanism of adsorption enhancement is well reproduced , we find agreement of the results in all special cases which were already investigated in the literature .",
    "a special feature of the variational method employed here is the possibility of quantifying the localization transition , i.e. , the transition from a slightly deformed gaussian coil to a localized conformation , where the polymer size perpendicular to the surface no longer depends on the chain length . according to the result ( [ loccrit ] )",
    "the localization can be obtained by increase either of the effective interaction strength or of the chain length .",
    "this helps to compare the strength of adsorption enhancement for the two sorts of disorder considered here : as can be seen from the maximum values of ( [ w3perint ] ) and ( [ w3pergeo ] ) or from a comparison of ( [ w3ranint ] ) and ( [ w3rangeo ] ) , the localization transition is only slightly affected by a rough surface profile , whereas energetical heterogeneity can induce the transition even at vanishing mean interaction strength .",
    "therefore we conclude that the disorder - induced enhancement of polymer adsorption is much more significant for a heterogeneous interaction strength than for spatial roughness .",
    "our findings concerning the localization behavior are affected qualitatively by the assumption of surface penetrability : for infinitely long chains at a flat and homogeneous impenetrable surface , the localization transition in contrast to ( [ loccrit ] ) only occurs for some nonzero value of the attractive potential @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we expect our main statement on the significance of adsorption enhancement to hold also for impenetrable surfaces , since the comparison of transparent and opaque surfaces in simple soluble cases by hone et al .",
    "@xcite shows that they should not be affected differently by weak surface heterogeneities .",
    "the polymer size parallel to the surface does not directly depend on the mean interaction strength , but only through the extension perpendicular to the surface .",
    "thus , because it is less affected by heterogeneity , the former always exceeds the latter , except for one special case : for a flat , neutral surface with a periodic interaction strength , the polymer size parallel to the surface is smaller than perpendicular to it , if the period fits the polymer size such that it is concentrated to a maximum of @xmath114 and even restricted by the neighboring repulsive regions .",
