    "the magnitude of @xmath43 and @xmath44 elements is at least an order of magnitude greater than the rest of the non - zero elements of @xmath6 . to account for the hierarchy between the non - zero elements of the neutrino mass matrices of classes @xmath9 , @xmath12 , @xmath10 and @xmath13",

    "the renormalization scale @xmath50 enters through @xmath51 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq27 ] ) one can see that in the flavor basis where the charged lepton yukawa coupling matrix is diagonal , the radiative corrections to each element of the effective neutrino mass matrix are multiplicative , so that a zero entry remains zero .",

    "the singlet neutrinos are successively integrated out which leads to modifications in running . in the full type - i+ii seesaw scenario ,",
    "the running of the effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath6 above and between the seesaw scales is given by the running of following three different contributions to @xmath6 : @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "the one loop @xmath57-functions for the effective neutrino mass matrix in various effective theories can be summarized as  @xcite @xmath58^t m_\\nu^{(i ) } + m_\\nu^{(i ) } [ c_l y_l y_l^\\dagger + c_\\nu y_\\nu y_\\nu^\\dagger + c_\\triangle y_\\triangle y_\\triangle^\\dagger ] + \\xi m_\\nu^{(i)}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 denotes any of the three contributions to the effective neutrino mass matrix .",
    "+ for all the yukawa coupling matrices realized in this work , the hermitian products @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) which are relevant for the rg evolution of @xmath6 come out to be diagonal so that rg corrections are again multiplicative on the effective neutrino mass matrix elements leaving zero elements intact .",
    "thus , although , the values of neutrino masses and neutrino mixing parameters change due to rg corrections while running down from the seesaw scale to the electroweak scale , the correlations induced between neutrino masses and mixing parameters by texture zeros remain unchanged due to the stability of texture zeros .",
    "the two texture zero neutrino mass matrices in the flavor basis have been fairly successful in describing neutrino masses and mixings . we have studied the implications of large effective majorana neutrino mass for a class of two texture zero neutrino mass matrices .",
    "we found that classes @xmath9 , @xmath12 , @xmath10 and @xmath13 all predict near maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing angle when supplemented with the assumption of large effective majorana neutrino mass .",
    "moreover , the near maximality of the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle is independent of the values of the solar and reactor neutrino mixing angles .",
    "furthermore , we have shown how one can obtain such texture structures in the context of type - i+ii seesaw using the discrete abelian group @xmath0 .",
    "assuming type - ii seesaw dominance one can explain the hierarchy between the non - zero elements of the effective neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the hermitian products @xmath60 for various yukawa coupling matrices realized in this work are all diagonal , leading to the stability of texture zeros against running from the seesaw to the electroweak scale .",
    "the assumption of large @xmath62 is motivated by the fact that there are a number of forthcoming and presently ongoing experiments searching for neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "these experiments are capable of confirming or ruling out large @xmath62 .",
