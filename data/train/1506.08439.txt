    "the calibration problem for lvy processes consists of the estimation of the canonical triplet @xmath11 given the observation @xmath22 of the process trajectory @xmath2 at some prescribed times @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "for instance , @xmath2 could be the process of log - returns of some asset and @xmath23 could be the closing time of the @xmath25-th trading day ( historic low frequency data ) . as the @xmath25-th increment of the process @xmath26 has the same distribution as @xmath27 , if @xmath28 , from a statistical point of view this is equivalent to the @xmath29-fold independent observation of the terminal values @xmath27 at time @xmath0 .",

    "the calibration problem for lvy processes , respectively the solution of ( [ eqa : sde ] ) , unfortunately is ill posed : the collection of all lvy measures @xmath40 is infinite dimensional , while only @xmath29 observations are available .",
    "direct application of the maximum likelihood principle in this situation leads to severe over - fitting issues @xcite . in many applications ,",
    "one chooses families of lvy measures @xmath41 that depend only on a finite dimensional parameter vector @xmath42 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one often restricts to such parametrizations , where the density @xmath43 of the probability distribution of @xmath2 can be calculated explicitly or at low numerical cost .",
    "one then assumes that the true distribution of @xmath2 is inside the prescribed set and uses the maximum likelihood approach for calibration @xcite .",
    "this assumption might however not be justified and give rise to modelling errors .    as a non - parametric alternative",
    ", one can use generic parametrizations for the density of the lvy measure @xmath15 that can be refined depending on the amount of data available .",
    "this gives rise to a hierarchy  or sieve @xcite  of maximum likelihood problems with a finite number of parameters .",
    "if a suitable finite parametrization has been chosen , it remains to solve the maximum likelihood estimate at a given level of parametrization .",
    "one also has to determine this level based on the quality and also stability of the fits obtained .",
    "the resulting densities can no longer be calculated analytically .",
    "also , solution of the maximum likelihood problem gives rise to high dimensional optimization problems .",
    "the maximum likelihood method requires a parametric representation of the probability density functions ( pdf ) .",
    "the pdf can however be obtained as a solution to the kolmogorov forward equation ( fokker planck equation ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath42 then enter in this equation via coefficients in the generator of the semigroup @xcite . if the lvy measure @xmath15 is not zero , the generator of both these equations does not only contain a 2nd order partial differential operator , but also an integral operator of convolution type .",
    "this places the model calibration problem in the framework of optimal control problems with partial integral differential equations ( pide ) constraints .",
    "indeed , we know that the kolmogorov forward equation is representative of a stochastic process described in terms of sdes such as that one of eq .",
    "( [ eqa : sde ] ) , where the set of parametrization for the approximation of the pdf , would correspond to a set of controls of the stochastic dynamic equation , so that , jointly to the maximum likelihood problem , it corresponds to a stochastic optimal control problem .",
    "the classical way to deal with the optimal control of stochastic process is by the dynamic programming principle and the related hamilton - jacobi - bellman equation for stochastic processes @xcite .",
    "however , this problem has been recently framed as a constrained pde optimization problem , where the pde is the fokker - planck , i.e. kolmogorov forward , equation @xcite . following this framework ,",
    "the solution of the maximum likelihood problem , i.e. the stochastic optimization , is found by solving the first order optimality conditions in a functional space , that is the optimality system consisting of two pides , named forward and backward ( or adjoint ) equations , plus an optimality condition .",
    "this optimality system can be numerically solved by a gradient - based iterative algorithm as follows .",
    "the kolmogorov forward equation has a set of control parameters in order to maximize the log - likelihood functional for its terminal value .",
    "these controls involve the kolmogorov backward equation ( adjoint equation ) with suitable terminal condition , corresponding to the log - likelihood functional .",
    "hence , given an initial approximation of the unknown parametrization , first solve the forward equation , then set up the terminal condition and solve the adjoint one .",
    "with both the forward and adjoint solutions , by using the optimality condition equation the gradient is computed .",
    "then with a descending gradient technique , such as a non linear conjugate gradient method , found a better approximation of the control parameters and repeat until the satisfying accuracy for the parametrization is found .    since this maximum likelihood problem could have an high dimensional space ad a huge number @xmath29 of observations , a fast , stable and enough accurate numerical solver for the pide is required . in our case",
    "the kolmogorov forward equation is a pide of parabolic differential operator type .",
    "such kind of pides are , e.g. , investigated in the option pricing models as a generalization of the black - scholes equation .",
    "the first difficulty to numerically solve this equation is the integral .",
    "in fact , in the case of using a fully implicit method , it would lead to solve a dense system of equation , for this reason implicit - explicit ( imex ) or operator splitting methods can be applied to bypass this problem ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the solution of the kolmogorov forward equation is a probability density function that is non negative with constant integral over the domain .",
    "such properties must be owned from the discrete solution too .",
    "the chang - cooper ( cc ) is a non - negative and conservative numerical method that has been used to solve the classical fokker - planck equation @xcite . here",
    ", we use a numerical method that can be classified as imex , since we use the cc method with an implicit time difference scheme for the differential operators of our pide , and evaluate the integral operator at the previous time step solution , i.e. in an explicit way .",
    "we prove for the resulting numerical solver : conservativeness , non - negativity and stability in the @xmath1-norm .",
    "the numerical solver for the adjoint equation is obtained directly from the solver for the forward equation by using the `` discretize then optimize '' approach to the optimization problem .    finally , we quote , that for related work with vanishing lvy measure see e.g. @xcite , and for estimation procedures based on non parametric approximations of the empirical characteristic function see e.g. @xcite .",
    "an approach based on the method of moments and asymptotic expansions of lvy densities can be found in @xcite .",
    "the article is organised as follows : in the following section [ sec : reg ] we describe the hierarchy , of estimation problems .",
    "we shall show that the estimation problems that can actually be solved numerically can come arbitrarily close , at increasing computational cost , to the fully general lvy estimation problem .",
    "we also show that the use of periodic boundary conditions in the kolmogorov equations can be understood in terms of mapping the original lvy process on the real line to a derived lvy process on the torus .    in section [ sec : kol ] , we set up the maximum likelihood estimation problem for a given parametrization and derive kolmogorov s forward ( fokker - planck ) equation and its adjoint ( kolmogorov backward ) equation with terminal conditions set by the log - likelihood objective functional .",
    "this maximum likelihood estimation problem is solved in the framework of the fokker - planck optimal control of stochastic processes , as a constrained pde optimal control problem .    in section [ sec : num ] the discretization for kolmogorov s equations and the optimal control scheme is derived following a chang - cooper and imex approach . in particular",
    "we prove the structural properties of the numerical solution , i.e. conservativeness , non - negativity and stability .",
    "section [ sec : cons ] gives numerical tests for the consistency of the proposed procedure based on simulated data .",
    "we propose to use akaike s information criterion ( aic ) @xcite to choose an adequate parametrization from the hierarchy of spline parametrizations for density of the lvy measure .",
    "three different tests are performed : we first fit data that are simulated from a given distribution within our hierarchy of lvy distributions .",
    "the fits obtained are shown to be of very good quality and aic - selection criterion reproduces almost the original parametrization . as a second test",
    "we fit simulated data from a bi - directional gamma process , i.e. the difference of two independent gamma processes @xcite , which is not inside one of the parametrizations of degree @xmath44 , but can be approximated by those .",
    "the bi - directional gamma process is augmented by a small diffusive component and projected to the torus . the aic selection criterion and the fitting results again",
    "reproduce the final distribution of this process rather adequately . as a final test",
    ", we select financial data from the german stock exchange dax in a period between april 1998 and march 2002 and consider daily log - returns over 1000 trading days .",
    "this period represents a rather stable period for the dax with an almost constant level of the volatility . after projection ,",
    "the aic based method selects a six - parameter spline approximation of the lvy measure density .",
    "the resulting fits again give a decent reproduction of the empirical distribution .",
    "our conclusions and an outlook are given in the final section [ sec : out ] .",
    "the estimation problem for the lvy measure @xmath15 is plagued by several issues .",
    "here we take a step by step approach towards the derivation of a hierarchy of estimation problems that approximate the original one .",
    "let @xmath45 , @xmath46 , be a family of probability density functions with variable dimension @xmath44 of the parameter set @xmath42 , and let @xmath47 be the ( unknown ) probability density of @xmath48 .    for @xmath44 fixed , we apply the maximum likelihood method to select an estimated value @xmath49 based on increasing sample size .",
    "it is known from the general theory of maximum likelihood @xcite that the estimated @xmath50 converges almost surely to the true value @xmath42 , provided @xmath51 holds .",
    "this leaves the question open , which parametrization  or which value for @xmath44 one should choose .",
    "we solve this problem by maximizing the akaike information criterion ( aic ) . maximizing the aic corresponds to minimizing ( asymptotically ) the expected kulback - leibler distance , or relative entropy , between the true distribution @xmath47 and its parametric estimate @xmath52 .",
    "see @xcite[chapter 6 ] for a detailed derivation .",
    "let us now define the parametrizations with @xmath44 parameters .",
    "we intend to show that , for sufficiently large @xmath53 , we can approximate the original lvy distribution to an arbitrary precision .",

    "high frequency historical data and implicit volatility data @xcite are natural candidates to set up new objective functionals for related control problems that go beyond the control of the terminal distribution .    another relevant problem is the notorious occurrence of local minima in the maximum likelihood estimation . we expect this to be more severe , when the number of parameters significantly increases .",
