    "collisional energy loss has recently attracted some attention @xcite and might be an explanation @xcite for the single electron puzzle observed in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "when incorporating collisional loss into quenching scenarii , one usually assumes that a heavy quark produced in a qgp immediately undergoes stationary energy loss . in @xcite , it was however argued that the reaction of the medium on the heavy quark ( of mass @xmath0 and energy @xmath1 ) can only set in after a retardation time @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the debye mass and @xmath4 . a calculation performed in a semi - classical framework based on the collective response of the medium ( previously used in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the stationary collisional loss @xmath5 ) , indeed showed a large reduction ( scaling as @xmath6 ) of @xmath5 .",
    "while half of the effect could be attributed to a modification of initial bremsstrahlung in medium as compared to vacuum , the other half was interpreted as a retardation of purely collisional loss . in the present work",
    "we show that this latter interpretation is incorrect , and we instead have @xmath7 for purely collisional loss , in agreement with the diagrammatic approach of ref .",
    "we also recall the study of ref .",
    "@xcite , which does not suffer from the misinterpretation of @xcite , and presents for the first time a consistent calculation of heavy quark energy loss at zeroth order in an opacity expansion , _",
    "i.e. _ including initial bremsstrahlung , transition radiation , as well as purely collisional processes .",
    "we assume the heavy quark to be produced in a static qgp of high temperature @xmath8 .",
    "the latter hypothesis implies the hierarchy @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the average distance between two constituents of the qgp , @xmath11 is the debye radius and @xmath12 is the mean free path of the heavy quark . under these hypotheses",
    ", we can describe the qgp via its _ collective _ response to the current @xcite , where the dielectric functions are obtained from the gluon polarization tensor .",
    "let us first consider the simple case of a heavy quark produced in the past ( thus associated to a stationary classical current ) in an infinite plasma .",
    "we first solve maxwell s equations in fourier space and then evaluate the work @xmath13 done on the charge by the _",
    "induced _ electric field , _ i.e. _ the field generated by the polarization of the medium . identifying the quark energy loss travelling the distance @xmath14 in the qgp as @xmath15 we have : @xmath16_{\\rm ind}\\ , \\delta(\\omega-\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{v } ) \\label{eloss_stationn}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is the component of the quark velocity @xmath19 parallel ( orthogonal ) to @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ( with @xmath22 or @xmath8 ) is the gluon spectral density @xmath23 where the first term corresponds to the ( time - like ) pole of the thermal gluon propagator @xmath24 , while the second is the magnitude of its cut in the space - like region and is the only term contributing to @xmath25 .",
    "we now turn to the case of a heavy quark produced _ at initial time @xmath26 _ in a hard subprocess ( still in an infinite qgp ) .",
    "when @xmath27 is much larger than all other scales ( in particular @xmath28 ) , the production of the bare quark factorizes from subsequent evolution .",
    "kinetic _ energy loss of the quark travelling the distance @xmath14 reads : @xmath29 where the subscript `` m '' denotes the _ mechanical _ work done on the quark . in fact , this work already differs from zero for a quark produced in vacuum since initial bremsstrahlung , induced by the sudden acceleration of the quark , leads to the reduction of @xmath30 after @xmath31 .",
    "this vacuum contribution should be subtracted from ( [ de_mech_basics ] ) .",
    "when discussing jet quenching observables such as nuclear attenuation factors @xmath32 , only the vacuum - subtracted _ medium - induced _ energy loss matters .",

    "although we observe a significant delay before the onset of stationary ( linear ) energy loss , this is not a genuine retardation of purely collisional loss , since various physical effects contribute to this delay .",
    "first , part of the work done on the charge from @xmath31 to @xmath50 is due to initial radiation . due to the difference between the gluon dispersion relations in medium and in vacuum ,",
    "the energy radiated in qgp differs from that in vacuum .",
    "this is the qcd equivalent of the ter - mikayelian ( tm ) effect , studied in @xcite and also properly identified in @xcite . in order to single out contributions specific to collisional loss",

    "this is easily done by subtracting @xmath51 - which sets the gluons or plasmons on mass shell - from the spectral functions ( [ spectral ] ) . denoting @xmath52 and @xmath53 the quantities of interest after this subtraction , we find @xmath54 for @xmath46 , _",

    "[ fig1 ] ( left ) , the dash - dotted line represents @xmath52 .",
    "as can already be seen in the case of a charge with @xmath55 produced in vacuum , the radiated energy represents only @xmath56 _ half _ of the mechanical work done on the charge after its production . using poynting s theorem",
    "we can show that the other half is associated to the creation of the charge s proper field . obviously , the _ self - energy _",
    "contribution should not be counted as `` energy loss '' as it is part of the charge asymptotic state .",
    "therefore , an accurate definition of energy loss - to be used for values of @xmath14 large enough so that the proper field can be disentangled from other components - is @xmath57 , where @xmath58 .",
    "although the self - energies - defined as the integral of the energy density @xmath59 - are separately uv divergent , @xmath60 is uv convergent and @xmath61 for @xmath46 . in fig .",

    "@xmath25 appears to be @xmath63 , showing that the retardation time due to purely collisional processes is @xmath64 , not @xmath65 as was argued in @xcite .",
    "we finally consider the most realistic situation , where the quark is produced in a hard subprocess in a _",
    "finite size _ qgp and travels the distance @xmath66 before escaping the medium . in this case the `` asymptotic '' ( we assume the quark to hadronize long after escaping the medium ) quark self - energy is the same as in vacuum , _ i.e. _ @xmath67 .",
    "it is thus legitimate to evaluate the ( induced ) energy loss using ( [ de_mech_rel ] ) , provided one includes the transition radiation field in the electric field @xmath68 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( right ) , the plain line presents the _ final _ result for the energy loss @xcite , incorporating all contributions of our model ( collisional energy loss + initial radiation + transition radiation ) .",
    "the shift with respect to @xmath25 is @xmath69 , in particular it scales as @xmath6 .",
    "this is due to a non - compensation - already noted in @xcite - between the tm effect and transition radiation .",
    "numerically @xmath70 ( in agreement with @xcite ) for @xmath71 , implying an effective retardation time @xmath72 before the linear ( stationary ) regime .",
