    "the `` most general '' form of the rosen metric is  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "the only non - zero component of the ricci tensor is  @xcite : @xmath8 though relatively compact , because of the implicit matrix inversions this is a grossly nonlinear function of the metric components . in particular , in this form of the metric the @xmath9 and @xmath10 linear polarizations do not decouple in any obvious way  @xcite .",
    "consider the strong - field gravity wave metric in the @xmath9 linear polarization .",
    "that is , set @xmath11 .",
    "it is found most useful to put the resulting metric in the form  @xcite @xmath12 then @xmath13 in vacuum we have the general vacuum wave for @xmath9 polarization in the form @xmath14 from the @xmath9 polarization , by rotating the @xmath15@xmath16 plane through a fixed but arbitrary angle @xmath17 , we can easily deal with linear polarization modes along any desired axis .",
    "now take an arbitrary , possibly @xmath18 dependent , polarization and consider the following metric ansatz  @xcite : @xmath19 \\d x^2 \\right . \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad \\left .",

    "the vacuum field equations imply @xmath21 let us introduce a dummy function @xmath22 and split this into the two equations @xmath23 the first of these equations is just the equation you would have to solve for a pure @xmath9 ( or in fact any linear ) polarization .",
    "the second of these equations can be rewritten as @xmath24 and is the statement that @xmath25 can be interpreted as distance in the hyperbolic plane @xmath26 .",
    "compare this to maxwell electromagnetism , where polarizations can be specified by @xmath27 with no additional constraints .",
    "thus an electromagnetic wavepacket of arbitrary polarization can be viewed as an arbitrary `` walk '' in the @xmath28 plane .",
    "we could also go to a magnitude - phase representation @xmath29 where @xmath30 so an electromagnetic wavepacket of arbitrary polarization can also be viewed as an arbitrary `` walk '' in the @xmath31 plane , where the @xmath31 plane is provided with the natural euclidean metric @xmath32 in contrast for gravitational waves in the rosen form we are now dealing with an arbitrary `` walk '' in the hyperbolic plane , @xmath26 . furthermore , because of the nonlinearity of general relativity , there is still one remaining differential equation to solve .",
    "as an important example , we consider strong - field circular polarization .",
    "circular polarization corresponds to a fixed distortion @xmath33 with a linear advancement of @xmath34 : @xmath35 then  @xcite @xmath36 \\d x^2 \\right .",

    "let us return to considering the metric in general rosen form @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 represent any arbitrary number of dimensions ( @xmath46 ) transverse to the @xmath47 plane .",
    "it is easy to check that the only non - zero component of the ricci tensor is still @xmath8 let us now decompose the @xmath48 matrix @xmath49 into an `` envelope '' @xmath50 and a unit determinant related to the `` direction of oscillation ''  @xcite .",

    "the vacuum field equations can be interpreted in terms of a single differential equation governing the `` envelope '' , coupled with an arbitrary walk in polarization space . in particular",
