    "<S> a classification is given of certain separable nuclear c*-algebras not necessarily of real rank zero , namely the class of simple c*-algebras which are inductive limits of continuous - trace c*-algebras whose building blocks have their spectrum homeomorphic to the interval @xmath0 $ ] or to a finite disjoint union of closed intervals . in particular , a classification of those stably ai algebras which are inductive limits of hereditary sub - c*-algebras of interval algebras is obtained . also , the range of the invariant is calculated . </S>"
