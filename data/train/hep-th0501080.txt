    "according to this theory the universe at the end of the inflationary period consisted almost entirely of the homogeneous inflaton field .",
    "after inflation this field decayed into inhomogeneous fluctuations and other forms of particles and fields , ultimately giving rise to the forms of matter that make up the universe today .",
    "an understanding of this decay period , known as reheating , can provide crucial links between the inflationary epoch and the subsequent thermalized hot big bang era .",
    "the reheating period may have involved high energy phase transitions , symmetry breaking , baryogenesis , and other effects that could have observable signatures and that could give us insights into physics at energies beyond the reach of accelerator experiments .",
    "early discussions of reheating were based on the assumption that the homogeneous inflaton field decayed perturbatively as a collection of particles @xcite .",
    "the perturbative mechanism typically requires thousands of oscillations of the inflaton field until it decays into usual elementary particles .",
    "more recently , however , it was discovered that coherent field effects such as parametric resonance can lead to the decay of the homogeneous field much faster than would have been predicted by perturbative methods , within few dozen oscillations @xcite .",
    "these coherent effects produce high energy , nonthermal fluctuations that could have significance for understanding developments in the early universe , such as baryogenesis .",
    "this early stage of rapid nonperturbative decay may be followed by a period of slower , perturbative effects , so the rapid early stage is called preheating .    in @xcite",
    "it was found that another effect known as tachyonic preheating can lead to even faster decay than parametric resonance .",
    "this effect occurs whenever the homogeneous field rolls down a tachyonic ( @xmath0 ) region of its potential . when that occurs a tachyonic , or spinodal instability leads to exponentially rapid growth of all long wavelength modes ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this growth can often drain all of the energy from the homogeneous field within a single oscillation .",
    "we are now in a position to classify the dominant mechanisms by which the homogeneous inflaton field decays in different classes of inflationary models .",
    "the simplest of these models can be broken into three classes : small field , or new inflation models @xcite , large field , or chaotic inflation models @xcite , and multi - field , or hybrid models @xcite .    in simple chaotic inflation preheating",
    "is generally dominated by parametric resonance , although there are parameter ranges where this can not occur .",
    ", such as @xmath2 . in non - oscillatory models such as exponential potentials",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of preheating in these models . ]",
    "tachyonic preheating does not occur in these models because the curvature of the potential is always positive .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that tachyonic preheating dominates the preheating phase in hybrid models of inflation . in this paper",
    "we explore preheating in new inflationary models .",
    "we find that for almost all realistic parameters tachyonic preheating works simultaneously with parametric resonance .",
    "the resulting effect is very strong , so that the homogeneous mode of the inflaton field typically decays within few oscillations .",
    "we should emphasize , however , that this stage of reheating is not the last one .",

    "we do not pretend that the taxonomy given above exhausts the space of all possible inflationary theories .",
    "one can imagine arbitrarily complicated models that combine aspects of small and large field models or theories with non - canonical kinetic terms , gravitational effects , and so on . nonetheless , we believe that by understanding preheating in these three classes of theories we will have a good understanding of all of the simplest possibilities , and in many cases the more complex models will simply involve combinations of the effects seen in these simpler cases .    in section [ tachyonic ]",
    "we give an analytic investigation of tachyonic preheating in the simplest model of new inflation .",
    "section [ parametric ] describes parametric resonance which occurs in this model . a full treatment , which would unify these two effects and take into account other important effects which may occur at the later stages of preheating , requires lattice calculations @xcite , which we perform using the program latticeeasy @xcite . in section [ lattice ]",
    "we describe our lattice simulations and summarize their results , including the growth of fluctuations , the properties of the resulting spectra , and the formation of domain walls .",
    "finally , we conclude with a summary of preheating in new inflation models and suggestions for further work .",
    "in this paper we are considering tachyonic preheating in models of new inflation , i.e.  models where the inflaton field rolls from a potential maximum at @xmath3 to a minimum at a symmetry breaking value @xmath4 .",
    "for definiteness we focus primarily on the original new inflation model @xcite based on the coleman - weinberg potential @xcite @xmath5 + { 1 \\over 16 } \\lambda v^4,\\ ] ] but the results we present should apply to any new inflation model ( with one small exception noted below . ) the potential energy takes its maximum value @xmath6 at @xmath3 and vanishes at the minima at @xmath7 .",
    "we are going to use units @xmath8 , even though sometimes we will write @xmath9 explicitly .    during inflation",
    "the field is near the maximum . roughly speaking",
    ", inflation ends when @xmath10 . neglecting factors of order unity ( including logarithmic factors )",
    "this occurs at a field value @xmath11 while this result is approximate , we have verified numerically that for a wide range of values of @xmath12 this field value corresponds to a time when kinetic energy is still orders of magnitude smaller than potential energy , so we can safely start our lattice simulations at this time without fear of missing important effects .",
    "first we consider the homogeneous rolling field , neglecting backreaction .",
    "the energy lost to hubble friction in one oscillation can be estimated as @xmath13 up to factors of order unity we can approximate @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , so @xmath17 approximating the potential near the top as a negative quartic potential we can use this formula to find the field value @xmath18 after the first oscillation @xmath19 @xmath20 continued application of this argument leads to the conclusion that after @xmath21 oscillations the field value will be roughly @xmath22    we wish now to estimate the growth of fluctuations due to tachyonic preheating .",
    "we consider preheating to be finished when @xmath23 , at which point it is meaningless to talk about oscillations of the homogeneous field . to estimate this growth we consider the growth of a single mode @xmath24 , which to first order obeys the equation of motion @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the effective mass of the field as a function of the value of the homogeneous field @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the physical ( not comoving ) momentum . because @xmath29 modes with @xmath30 will experience exponential growth .    to estimate the speed of this growth we can use the following trick .",
    "if we consider a homogeneous field we can define a variable @xmath31 and write an equation of motion for @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 thus modes with @xmath35 obey the same equation of motion as the derivative @xmath36 .",
    "we know the solution to the equation for @xmath36 from energy conservation , though . treating the potential as an inverted quartic and neglecting hubble friction , @xmath37 .",
    "the growth of the fluctuations @xmath38 is determined by the modes with @xmath39 , so @xmath38 also grows proportionally to @xmath40 .    at the end of inflation @xmath41 thus after the field falls to the minimum at @xmath4 @xmath42 note that as the field rolls back up the potential the fluctuations will not lose this growth because the waves are decoherent .",
    "this result says that for @xmath43 , which is typically of order @xmath44 , preheating will complete in a single oscillation . for larger values of @xmath12",
    "we must consider subsequent oscillations .",
    "in each one @xmath45 grows by an amount @xmath46 , which is roughly @xmath47 , so after @xmath21 oscillations the fluctuations will have grown to roughly @xmath48 the number of oscillations required for @xmath45 to reach @xmath12 in this approximation is @xmath49 for @xmath50 , which corresponds to cobe normalization of density perturbations , and @xmath51 , which corresponds to the gut scale , preheating will complete in roughly 5 oscillations .",
    "of course when @xmath52 the perturbative approximation will break down , but preheating will be over . as we will see , the numerical investigation confirms this simple estimate .",
    "qualitatively these results depend only on the fact that the inflaton feels an inverted polynomial potential as it rolls from its maximum at @xmath3 to the minimum at @xmath4 .",
    "thus the same type of behavior would result from an inverted quartic with or without logarithmic corrections , an inverted cubic potential , or nearly any other symmetry breaking potential .",
    "is constant as the field rolls , so inflation can not end in this regime . ]    these estimates suggest that for any @xmath53 tachyonic preheating will drain the energy from the homogeneous , oscillating , inflaton field within a few oscillations .",
    "we will see in the next section that there are important corrections to these rough estimates , and for @xmath12 sufficiently large tachyonic preheating does not operate , however for @xmath54 the behavior is qualitatively as described by these analytical estimates .",
    "in addition to the tachyonic preheating , there is also a parametric resonance in this model .",
    "the most efficient part of this process occurs far from the minimum of the effective potential , where it was expected to happen in the earlier works on reheating in new inflation @xcite .",
    "indeed , let us find the range of the values of the field @xmath55 , for which the adiabaticity condition is violated and a broad parametric resonance takes place .    the adiabaticity condition is @xmath56 . here",
    "instead of investigating the general case , let us look at the vicinity of the point @xmath58 , where @xmath59 , i.e. at the point where the low - momenta modes change their nature from normal to tachyonic .",
    "at that point @xmath60 , whereas @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "this gives a broad range of momenta @xmath63 for which the adiabaticity condition is violated : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the mass of the inflaton field in the minimum of @xmath66 at @xmath67 .",
    "this means that the parametric resonance is powerful enough to excite all modes and create particles with momenta smaller than ( the half of ) the mass of the inflaton field at the minimum of its effective potential .",
    "these momenta , however , are much higher than the smallest momenta excited by tachyonic preheating .    but this is also the range of momenta where the tachyonic amplification of fluctuations is operative . in fact , when the scalar field moves in the region with @xmath68 , its mass is tachyonic , so many of the modes produced due to strong nonadiabaticity near @xmath69 continue growing exponentially when the field moves in the region @xmath68 .    as a result ,",
    "parametric resonance and tachyonic growth amplify each other , which should lead to an even faster decay of the homogeneous scalar field , with the spectrum of produced fluctuations spanning a large range of momenta , from the inflationary hubble constant @xmath70 to the mass of the field in the minimum of its effective potential @xmath71 .",
    "the homogeneous scalar field @xmath55 should decay within just a few of its oscillations . in this sense ,",
    "new inflation takes an intermediate position between hybrid inflation , where the decay is purely tachyonic and takes just a single oscillation , and the simplest versions of chaotic inflation scenario , where the decay is due to parametric resonance and occurs within few dozen oscillations . in what follows",
    "we will describe the results of numerical simulations of reheating in new inflation .",
    "while the estimates in the previous section provide a useful general description of the process of tachyonic preheating in new inflation , a full analysis including backreaction and rescattering effects requires a lattice simulation .",
    "we performed a series of simulations of the coleman - weinberg model ( [ cwpotential ] ) using the latticeeasy program @xcite .",
    "we used @xmath50 , which is fixed by the normalization of the cosmic microwave background , but we varied @xmath12 as a free parameter . in all of the figures in this section time is measured in units of @xmath72 , wave number @xmath63 is measured in units of @xmath73 , and the inflaton field @xmath55 is measured in units of @xmath12 .",
    "note that @xmath73 is the mass of the inflaton field in the minimum of the effective potential ; we use the gravitational planck mass @xmath74 .    the number of gridpoints required to meet both of these requirements was quite large , which restricted us to doing one and two dimensional simulations .",
    "we verified for each case that the essential features were unchanged in going from one to two dimensions , so we tentatively infer that the same basic results would hold in three dimensions as well . in the appendix",
    "we give all of the parameters and other details about the simulations .",
    "= 0.6    figure [ vnegonemean ] shows the evolution of the mean value of the inflaton field for @xmath75 .",
    "the hubble friction has a slightly greater effect on the field than our rough analytical estimates suggested .",
    "the result of this small correction is that after falling from the top of the potential the mean of the field never comes back up into the tachyonic region .",
    "consequently tachyonic preheating and the parametric resonance described in the previous section does not occur for this high value of the symmetry breaking scale .",
    "fluctuations of the field in this simulation never grew from their initial vacuum values .",
    "the decay of the homogeneous component of the inflaton field in this regime occurs very slowly . in the beginning",
    ", it may occur due to a very narrow and inefficient parametric resonance , as described in section iv of ref .",
    "@xcite , but then very rapidly this resonance completely disappears , and decay continues due to perturbative effects described in @xcite .",

    "figure [ vnegthreemeansvars ] shows the mean and variance of the inflaton field for @xmath76 . in this plot",
    "you can clearly see that the mean field oscillates through the tachyonic region repeatedly , leading to rapid exponential growth of fluctuations .",
    "after about five or six such oscillations the zero mode is effectively destroyed .",
    "we did simulations of values of @xmath12 ranging from @xmath77 to @xmath78 and found that the cutoff below which tachyonic preheating was efficient was somewhere in between @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "thus for nearly all realistic values of the parameters , tachyonic preheating may be expected to dominate the initial decay of the homogeneous inflaton field in models of the type we are considering . in the rest of this section we will focus on results for @xmath81 as an illustrative example , but we found these results to be typical for parameters for which tachyonic preheating was possible .",
    "= 0.9    to explore the decay of the homogeneous inflaton in greater detail we can consider the occupation number @xmath82 of different modes .",
    "figure [ vnegthreespectra0 ] shows the development of this spectrum over time . at the first time",
    "shown the field has been slowly rolling near the top of the potential .",
    "only very long wavelength modes have been excited by this point . in the next frame",
    "we see continued growth of long - wavelength modes due to tachyonic preheating .",
    "tachyonic preheating can only amplify modes with @xmath83 .",
    "the effective mass of the field varies from zero at the maximum to a minimum value of @xmath84 , so modes with momenta above this cutoff were not excited .",
    "even for modes below the cutoff , lower @xmath63 modes were excited more strongly than higher @xmath63 modes because the field spent more time in the regime where these low @xmath63 modes were tachyonic .    following this initial stage we see the growth of higher @xmath63 modes , leading to the development of a peak around @xmath85 .",
    "the modes in this peak region are marginally able to be excited by tachyonic preheating .",
    "moreover , tachyonic preheating would be expected to produce a monotonically decreasing spectrum like the one in the second frame of figure [ vnegthreespectra0 ] , rather than a peak such as we see in the third frame .",
    "this peak must therefore be the result of parametric resonance , as described in section [ parametric ] . as a further check",
    ", we examined whether the formation of this peak was purely attributable to parametric resonance produced by the oscillating zero mode , or whether it was also influenced by scattering from the already - produced long - wavelength modes .",
    "to this end we solved the coupled equations for the evolution of the zero mode ( neglecting backreaction ) and a single mode from the peak .",
    "= 0.65    figure [ levsmath ] compares the growth of this mode in the lattice simulation to its growth when coupled only to the zero mode .",
    "the two plots are nearly identical until the point when backreaction from the long - wavelength modes significantly affects the zero mode .",
    "thus the formation of the peak in the third frame of figure [ vnegthreespectra0 ] is purely a result of parametric resonance resulting from the oscillations of the zero mode .",
    "note , however , that this plot also shows the need for lattice simulations ; a linear analysis would not show the effects of backreaction and the point at which the decay of the homogeneous mode completes .",
    "figure [ modegrowth ] shows a zoomed in view of the growth of the mode depicted in figure [ levsmath ] .",
    "the growth of the occupation number occurs when the field is high on the potential hill and this growth alternates with periods of unchanging occupation number as the field moves through the minimum .",
    "this figure can be compared with the images showing broad parametric resonance in @xcite . in both cases",
    "the growth occurs when @xmath86 passes through zero , but in the case considered in @xcite that occurred around the potential minimum , whereas here it occurs on the side of the potential hill .",
    "= 0.6    in summary , the fluctuations of the field pass through several distinct stages .",
    "initially modes with @xmath87 are excited by tachyonic preheating . later",
    "modes with @xmath88 are excited by parametric resonance with the still oscillating zero mode , producing a peak in the spectrum .",
    "later still this peak smooths out due to rescattering , the oscillations of the zero mode cease , the peak in the spectrum is smoothed out , and we end up with a flat spectrum in the ir followed by an exponential cutoff near @xmath89 , as shown in the final frame of figure [ vnegthreespectra0 ] .",
    "this is similar to the spectrum that would be produced by parametric resonance in a large - field inflationary model , but the decay is significantly more rapid in this case . as a result ,",
    "the total energy available to the high energy modes is very large .",
    "these processes are illustrated by a series of four panels in fig .",
    "6 , which show a two - dimensional distribution of the inflaton scalar field @xmath55 at different stages of our calculations .",
    "the simulation was done for @xmath90 on a @xmath91 lattice , and the output was averaged over 8 lattice points for display in the figure .",
    "the first of the four panels in fig .",
    "6 shows the distribution of the field @xmath55 at the time @xmath92 , at the very early stages of rolling of the field towards the minimum of its effective potential . at that time the average amplitude of the field",
    "was still very small @xmath93 .",
    "the interval of change shown in this panel is 0.0001 . as we see , the amplitude of fluctuations of this field at that time is well below this level : the field looks almost completely homogeneous , apart for small quantum fluctuations which did not grow much at that stage .",

    "we see that the long wavelength perturbations have already grown up significantly , and have magnitude @xmath96 .",

    ". its average amplitude at that time is @xmath98 .",
    "the interval of change shown in this panel is 0.0002 , i.e.  two times greater than in the previous panels .",
    "as we can see , the amplitude of the long wavelength perturbations experienced an additional growth , but new perturbations with a much shorter wavelength have grown up on top of the long wavelength perturbations .",
    "finally , the last panel in fig .  6 shows the distribution of the field @xmath99 . at that time",
    "the short wavelength fluctuations completely dominate the field distribution .",
    "the average value of the scalar field @xmath27 no longer oscillates .",
    "its value is close to 1 , though it is slightly smaller than 1 because of the partial symmetry restoration due to the contribution of the fluctuations @xmath100 to the effective potential .",

    "= 1    if one would use perturbation theory to estimate the total time which it takes for the decay of the homogeneous component of the scalar field following @xcite , one would find that this decay occurs only after @xmath102 oscillations for @xmath103 .",
    "it is quite amazing therefore that the nonperturbative effects lead to this decay within only 5 oscillations .",
    "the resulting field distribution after 5 oscillations , shown in the last panel of fig .",
    "6 , is quite different from what one could expect on the basis of the perturbative approach to reheating or on the theory of parametric resonance in models of chaotic inflation .    as we see from fig .  3 , the occupation numbers of @xmath55-particles produced by the decaying inflaton field are exponentially large",
    "this means that the initially homogeneous field @xmath55 decays into semi - classical waves of the field @xmath55 . since the main contribution to the occupation numbers of produced particles",
    "is given by particles ( waves ) with very small momenta , one could be tempted to conclude that the main reason of the rapid decay of the homogeneous component of the scalar field is the tachyonic preheating . on the other hand ,",
    "the phase volume of these modes is relatively small .",
    "we have verified that for @xmath104 the main reason for the rapid decay of the homogeneous field @xmath55 in our computer simulations is the production of the particles with momenta @xmath105 due to parametric resonance combined with the tachyonic effects , see section [ parametric ] .",
    "we expect , however , that for @xmath106 , the main mechanism of the decay of the homogeneous mode will be related to the tachyonic preheating described in section [ tachyonic ] .",
    "so far we have described analytically and numerically how tachyonic preheating and parametric resonance cause the homogeneous inflaton field to rapidly decay into its own fluctuations .",
    "this process leads to the decoherence of the inflaton field and to spontaneous symmetry breaking , i.e.  to the disappearance of the amplitude of oscillations of its homogeneous component .",

    "this suggests that the decay of the field @xmath55 eventually ends up by a perturbative stage when the field @xmath55 no longer oscillates coherently , and therefore one can use an approximation where each particle of the field @xmath55 decays independently , according to elementary theory of reheating developed in @xcite . in this case the final temperature of reheating is given by @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the rate of decay @xmath120 in our model @xcite ; @xmath121 .",
    "simple estimates based on the decay rates for this model calculated in @xcite show that for @xmath122 the perturbative decay requires @xmath123 oscillations , i.e.  about @xmath124 oscillations in the model of new inflation with @xmath103 .",
    "the resulting temperature of reheating for @xmath125 , @xmath126 is @xmath127 gev .",
    "whereas this scenario of the last stage of reheating seems rather general , there could be some important exceptions .",
    "for example , some fields interacting with the inflaton field may remain light even though their interaction with the inflaton field is very strong .",
    "this is possible if their mass is protected by some symmetry or if their mass is small in the minimum of the effective potential due to some cancellation mechanism . in this case",
    "the decay rate of the inflaton field into such fields can be quite large , the final stage of reheating may also be very rapid , and the resulting reheating temperature can be much higher .",
    "the first papers on reheating of the universe after inflation were devoted to investigation of this process in the new inflation scenario @xcite .",
    "it was assumed that after inflation the nearly homogeneous scalar field oscillates for a very long time and eventually decays into particles of other fields in a process which can be described by a simple particle - by - particle decay of the scalar field @xmath55 .",

    "after the first oscillation , the field @xmath55 never acquires the tachyonic mass .",

    "a description of this regime can be found in section iv of ref .",

    ", the nonperturbative effects can be very powerful .",
    "as we have shown , a combination of tachyonic preheating and parametric resonance leads to a rapid dumping of energy of the oscillating inflaton field .",

    "the decay occurs even much faster .",
    "however , during this decay , the homogeneous oscillating inflaton field @xmath55 decays to decoherent waves of the field @xmath55 ; its decay to the matter particles @xmath109 at this stage typically is rather inefficient .",
    "therefore the rapid nonperturbative stage of preheating is not the end of the story but only a prelude to a lengthy stage of perturbative decay , which eventually gives the reheating temperature that could be calculated by the methods developed more than 20 years ago @xcite .    in this respect ,",
    "the new inflationary scenario differs strongly from the simplest versions of chaotic inflation where the effect of parametric resonance and the subsequent violent stage of rescattering of produced particles makes thermalization much faster @xcite .",
    "it differs even more from the hybrid inflation , where the process of decay of the zero mode of the inflaton takes just a single oscillation , and the subsequent stage of perturbative decay can occur relatively fast because the corresponding coupling constants there can be relatively large .",
    "the main reason of the slow decay of the inflaton field is related to the fact that the fields with which the inflaton field @xmath55 interacts strongly are getting heavy because of this interaction ( this does not happen in the simplest versions of the chaotic inflation scenario ) . as a result",
    ", the inflaton field can only decay to the particles with which it almost does not interact @xcite .",

    "the lattice spacing had to be chosen to be small enough to include modes with wavelengths @xmath130 , the effective mass at the minimum of the potential , while the total size of the box had to be large enough to include significant numbers of modes with @xmath131 , the tachyonic mass at the end of inflation .",
