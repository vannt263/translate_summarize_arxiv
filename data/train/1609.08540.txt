    "the results shown in the left panel * a * were obtained at fixed temperature @xmath147 .",
    "we included the available zero - temperature nrg data for @xmath142 . comparing the ct - hyb results with nrg shows that the chosen temperature used in ct - hyb is low enough to provide a reasonable value of critical @xmath110 for which the current changes sign .",
    "this point is pushed to higher values of @xmath4 with increasing @xmath13 and for high enough values of @xmath13 the region of the negative current ( @xmath0-phase ) is no longer present .",
    "similar behavior is obtained by changing the temperature for a fixed value of @xmath13 in the right panel * b*. this indicates that indeed the normal coupling @xmath13 and temperature have qualitatively the same effect on the system they both lead to the broadening of the andreev / shiba states and to vanishing of the @xmath0-phase .",

    "more precisely , we attempt to mutually match two curves : one with very small @xmath144 and finite @xmath13 ( red line ) and the other with very small @xmath13 and finite effective temperature @xmath148 ( blue and green curves ) . as can be seen from the figure , this attempt fails we can fit either the small- or high-@xmath4 parts of the current - phase relations with various effective temperatures , but we can not find a single effective temperature which would cover the whole phase range .",
    "thus , the correspondence between the finite normal - lead coupling @xmath13 and temperature is only a vague qualitative analogy which should be used with much care .",
    "unfortunately , the phase - dependent josephson current does not indicate directly any features that could be strictly assigned to the kondo effect .",
    "we hence think that the josephson loop of the three - terminal structure would be useful merely for spotting the singlet - doublet crossover region , where the andreev differential conductance should reveal the characteristic zero - bias enhancement .",

    "[ sec : spectral - function ] are governed by the very same low - energy scale , i.e. , the kondo scale @xmath68 .",
    "this means that the measurable width of the differential andreev conductance @xmath155 peak at @xmath156 can be related to the kondo scale @xmath68 theoretically studied in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectral - function ] and , therefore , our theoretical predictions can be experimentally verified . at sufficiently low temperature the andreev conductance @xmath157 in terms of the conductance quantum @xmath158 is equal to twice the andreev transmittance , @xmath159 , and we thus just consider the two quantities interchangeably .",

    "we can clearly see that around @xmath160 both quantities overlap , which proves that the zero - frequency ( kondo ) peaks are determined by a single scale which can be easily related to the kondo scale studied in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectral - function ] .",
    "technically , the andreev transmittance is given as the square of the off - diagonal component of green s function and that is the reason why it should be compared with the square of the diagonal spectral function which is determined by the diagonal part of green s function .",
