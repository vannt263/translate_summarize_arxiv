    "the experimental schemes to realize the quantum hall effect and the quantum anomalous hall effect by cold atoms have been proposed .",
    "those methods include globally rotating the trap or optical lattice , or introducing synthetic gauge potential generated by laser beams and so on @xcite .",
    "the qah effect is also predicted to be realizable in the @xmath0-band optical lattice system by rotating each optical lattice site around its own center @xcite . yet , in contrast to the experimental discovery of the quantum hall @xcite and quantum spin hall effects @xcite , no observation of qah effect in condensed - matter or cold - atom systems has been reported .    in this paper",
