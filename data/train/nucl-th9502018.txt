    "one of the most striking empirical indications for the approximate chiral symmetry of the strong interaction is the existence of the two complete low mass vector meson nonets with opposite parities .",
    "an important phenomenological implication of the vector mesons is their role in the electromagnetic structure of the baryons .",
    "it was realized early on that the @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons can be used to parametrize the isovector and isoscalar electromagnetic formfactors of the nucleon in terms of ( di)pole forms (  vector meson dominance  vmd ) @xcite @xcite .",
    "the vmd idea has also been extended to the parametrization of the axial isovector form factor of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated e.g. by the phenomenological vector meson lagrangian proposed in ref.@xcite , which suggests that the charged weak vector and axial vector nucleon form factors should be expressed as pole terms that contain the masses @xmath6 and @xmath7 of the @xmath4 and @xmath8 mesons and their respective couplings @xmath9 , and @xmath10 to the external @xmath11 weak current .",
    "we here extend the vmd hypothesis to the isoscalar axial form factor of the nucleon along the lines of refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and present a model for the @xmath12 coupling constant .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we calculate the weak decay couplings of the @xmath2 ( subsequently denoted by @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 ( subsequently denoted by @xmath15 ) mesons and exploit vmd to derive relations between hadronic and semileptonic couplings . in section 3 we calculate the contribution of the @xmath16 triangle diagram to the @xmath17 vertex and demonstrate its importance for the coupling of the nucleon to an external isoscalar axial vector current .",
    "the paper ends with a short summary .",
    "the neutral weak axial current of the nucleon @xmath18 is determined by the matrix element of the corresponding isotriplet ( @xmath19 ) , singlet ( @xmath20 ) , and octet ( @xmath21 ) quark currents as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the flavour triplet @xmath24 of up , down and strange quark fields .",
    "the vmd hypothesis implies the following field ",
    "current identities : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , which denote the fields of the isotriplet , the octet singlet , and the octet isoscalar axial vector mesons , respectively and @xmath29 are the corresponding decay constants .",
    "the vmd hypothesis allows derivation of interesting relations between various hadronic and semileptonic couplings .",
    "for example , in describing the @xmath30 annihilation coupling constant @xmath31 by means of the chain @xmath32 ( fig .",
    "1a ) the following expression is obtained : @xmath33    another intriguing relation arises between the pion weak decay coupling constant @xmath34 and the coupling constant @xmath35 of the ( hypothetical ) weak decay reaction @xmath36 , which is of interest for the evaluation of short range meson exchange currents in nuclear muon capture reactions of the type displayed in fig .",
    "1b , @xmath37 to obtain this equation we use the lagrangian density @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( 2.4 ) @xmath39 is the external weak axial lepton current .    in the limit of equal meson masses",
    "the nonrelativistic quark model leads to the following relation between these decay constants : @xmath40 the numerical value of @xmath41 is determined by the second weinberg sum rule @xcite as @xmath42 , while @xmath9 is given by the ksfr relation as @xmath43 , where @xmath34 is the pion decay constant .",
    "( 2.2 ) allows expression of the couplings @xmath44 and @xmath45 in terms of @xmath41 .",
    "this leads to the following numerical values : @xmath46 according to the universal current - current coupling model the meson - nucleon vertices are described by effective lagrangians of the type @xmath47    in the quark model the wave functions of the low lying vector mesons are described as linear combinations of quark  antiquark ( @xmath48 ) pairs in ( three dimensional ) flavour space .",
    "the physical singlet and isoscalar states of both the vector and axial vector meson nonets are moreover predicted to be mixed by the so called  ideal  mixing angle @xmath49 with the consequence that the states @xmath1 and @xmath50 decouple completely .",
    "this is equivalent to a suppression of @xmath51 transitions ( the okubo ",
    "iizuka rule ) .",
    "consequently the decay of , say , the @xmath52 meson into three pions via the chain @xmath53 is represented in qcd by nonplanar diagrams , which are known to be suppressed relative to the leading planar graphs by @xmath54 .",
    "the constants @xmath55 and @xmath56 corresponding to the ideally mixed @xmath13 and @xmath15 mesons are then given as @xmath57 in this way the couplings of the isoscalar axial vector mesons to the external lepton current equal ( up to the sign ) the corresponding couplings of the isocalar vector mesons for which the following relations have been obtained within the quark model @xcite , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "the experimental values for the physical mixing angle ( subsequently denoted by @xmath60 ) , which have been extracted from the empirical meson masses with linear or quadratic mass formulae , disagree however with the ideal one .",
    "this difference is comparatively small in the case of the vector meson nonet ( about @xmath61 ) .",
    "even so , the small observed @xmath62 mixing has a non ",
    "negligible impact on the weak vector strangeness radius of the nucleon a result obtained in @xcite , @xcite under the assumption of vmd of the isoscalar weak vector current .",
    "the axial vector meson nonet is clearly also non - ideal , as the empirical mixing value for it is @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the wave functions of the isoscalar axial vector mesons that take into account the mixing between the strange and non strange quarkonia are    @xmath64    the substantial deviation of the d  e mixing from the ideal mixing angle is explained qualitatively in qcd as being due to strong nonperturbative effects in the isoscalar axial channel @xcite . in the case of the mixed isoscalar axial vector mesons eqs .",
    "( 2.9)(2.10 ) are replaced by @xmath65    the isoscalar axial vector mesons d(1285 ) and e(1420 ) are expected to be important as intermediate states in @xmath66 annihilation as well as in neutrino scattering processes . in this context the weak decay couplings of the @xmath67 mesons can be associated with the quantities @xmath68 .",
    "the interpretation of the latter as the strong meson ",
    "nucleon couplings is , however , not obvious .",
    "this follows from the observation that eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) in fact reduces to @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the weak proton axial coupling constant , and @xmath71 denotes the so called weak isoscalar nucleon coupling ( @xmath72 @xcite ) .",
    "this equation suggests that the coupling constants in the @xmath12 and @xmath73 vertices ( in turn denoted by @xmath74 , and @xmath75 ) will be determined by the @xmath1 components of the corresponding wave functions according to @xmath76 here @xmath77 denotes the coupling of the purely strange quarkonia to the nucleon . by the parity invariance ( chiral symmetry ) of the strong interaction",
    "one can assume that the value @xmath78 from the axial vector meson nonet equals the empirical value of @xmath79 , which is extracted from data on the vector meson nonet @xcite .",
    "this yields the following relation @xmath80    in the following section we show that by attributing the f@xmath81(1285)nn coupling to the @xmath3 triangle diagram , which is the dominant one loop contribution to the isoscalar weak axial nucleon coupling , the empirical value for the coupling of the @xmath1 quarkonium to the nucleon is well understood .",
    "the @xmath83 triangle diagram contribution to the @xmath13-nucleon coupling @xmath74 ( fig .",
    "2 ) and the corresponding form factor can be calculated using the @xmath84 lagrangian ( 2.5 ) and the following lagrangians for the @xmath85 and @xmath86 couplings    @xmath87    here @xmath88 and @xmath89 in turn denote the pseudovector @xmath90nn and the scalar @xmath91 coupling constants , for which we adopt the values @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "these values are implied by the semiphenomenological bonn one boson exchange model for the nucleon - nucleon interaction @xcite .",
    "we define the effective d - nucleon vertex by the scalar product between the weak isoscalar axial vector current of the nucleon ( @xmath18 ) and the @xmath2 field ( denoted by @xmath94 ) as @xmath95 the product @xmath96 equals now the quantity @xmath74 introduced by eq .",
    "( 2.16 ) with @xmath97 . to regularize the integral in the triangle diagrams in fig.2",
    "we introduce the same monopole formfactors at the @xmath90nn and @xmath98nn vertices as in the potential model @xcite .",
    "the two triangle diagrams then give the following contribution to the dnn vertex : @xmath99 here @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the mass parameters in the monopole vertex factors , for which we use the values 1.3 gev and 2.0 gev respectively , and the function @xmath102 is defined as @xmath103 the dnn coupling constant is obtained by setting @xmath104 in eq . ( 3.4 ) .",
    "note that as @xmath105 the expression ( 3.4 ) has a small imaginary part when the d - meson is on shell , which we shall ignore .",
    "using for @xmath106 the value 5.7 from the experimental partial decay width @xcite , the real part of ( 3.4 ) at @xmath104 is then 1.9 , which we shall interpret as the value for the dnn coupling constant , i.e. @xmath107 the @xmath108 dependence of @xmath74 is shown in fig.3 .",
    "the @xmath108-dependence corresponds approximately to that of a monopole form with a mass scale parameter @xmath109 2 gev .",
    "it has long been known that the @xmath110nn coupling is strongly underpredicted in the quark model as seen from the unexpectedly large value for the @xmath111nn coupling extracted from data analyses in @xcite .",
    "comparison of our result from eq .",
    "( 3.6 ) shows that the numerical value for @xmath74 associated with the @xmath3 triangle diagram agrees fairly well with the empirical estimate given in eq .",
    "( 2.17 ) . consequently , in spite of the small decay width of the @xmath2 meson the coupling constant in the @xmath12 vertex seems to be completely exhausted by the contribution of the @xmath3 triangle diagram .",
    "+ the result that the empirical value for that coupling constant can be explained by the @xmath112 triangle diagram alone shows that the meson model is able to predict realistic results for reactions that involve the coupling of the @xmath113 system to nucleons .",
    "+ using the experimental value of @xmath71 from @xcite the value of @xmath114 is obtained as @xmath115 which is compatible with the size of @xmath116 obtained by means of the ksfr relation .",
