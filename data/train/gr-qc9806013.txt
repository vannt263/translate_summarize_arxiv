    "multiply - connected spacetimes are attracting an increasing amount of attention among gravitational physicists and cosmologists .",
    "although the idea that our universe could be topologically non - trivial has been around for quite some time @xcite , the possibility of setting observational constraints on this topology by performing a careful search for particular correlations in the cosmic microwave background is a recent development @xcite .",
    "further interest has been spurred by the realization that domain walls in the early universe can give rise to pair - production of black holes with event horizons whose topology is non - trivial @xcite .",
    "such objects have been referred to as topological black holes , or tbhs .",
    "it is the formation of these objects that we are concerned with in this paper . in an earlier paper",
    ", we demonstrated that a dust cloud in a multiply - connected , anti de sitter spacetime could collapse to a tbh in a process that is analogous to the usual oppenheimer - snyder collapse @xcite .",
    "the solutions obtained matched a static exterior spacetime to a dynamic collapsing cloud .",
    "the question of whether corresponding static solutions exist was left unresolved .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the existence of stable perfect fluid solutions in multiply - connected , anti de sitter spacetime .",
    "the spatial sections of such spacetimes have the topology @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a two - dimensional compact space of genus @xmath3 .",
    "such a space may be described by a metric which is either flat , spherically or hyperbolically symmetric .",
    "the spherically symmetric case is simply connected and has genus @xmath4 .",
    "the flat and hyperbolic cases are made compact via appropriate identifications in those two dimensions .",
    "perfect fluid solutions in such spacetimes are centrally located , separated from the exterior spacetime at a constant radius . in the @xmath4 case",
    "they correspond to a ball of fluid surrounded by a cosmological vacuum spacetime ; in the @xmath5 case the analogous objects may be referred to as topological stars .",
    "we find that the only stable solutions for @xmath6 necessitate the development of a wormhole inside the star . a constant positive matter density throughout the star necessarily implies an infinite pressure somewhere in its interior , excluding such objects as stable solutions .",
    "the situation is considerably different if we consider matter which violates the weak energy condition .",
    "it has been shown that negative concentrations of stress - energy can collapse to black holes of negative mass provided the cosmological constant is sufficiently large in magnitude @xcite .",
    "we find that it is possible to construct topological ( wormhole ) stars with constant negative matter density and have finite negative pressure throughout .",
    "the negative pressure is a tension which acts to hold together the negative density , which is gravitationally self - repulsive .",
    "section 2 discusses the three spacetimes of interest , as well as their topologies .",
    "the spherically symmetric case has much in common with earlier studies , but we dropped the demand that the metric be well - behaved at the origin .",
    "section 3 introduces the interior metrics and their einstein equations . in section 4",
    ", the structure of the solutions for a variable matter density is found using perturbative techniques .",
    "section 5 produces a solution for the pressure within wormholes of constant density as a function of radius .",
    "it is shown in section 6 that this must necessarily become infinite somewhere within a wormhole with constant positive density .",
    "the question of wormholes with negative matter density is addressed in section 7 .",

    "@xmath13 assumes values between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "when @xmath16 , the universe takes on the familiar spherically symmetric form , and the @xmath17 sector has constant positive curvature .",
    "the cosmological constant may assume either sign , but we will only examine behavior resulting from negative values in the models explored here . when @xmath18 , the space is flat , with @xmath11 less than zero . in order to produce the central star to be examined , a space with two sides identified is considered .",
    "the outer edge of the star will be an identified flat plane of constant ` radius , ' @xmath9 .",
    "identification requires the edges of this plane to be geodesics , which are in this case straight lines .",
    "the sum of the angles must be @xmath15 , yielding a parallelogram , or in the simplest case , a square or rectangle with opposite sides identified , creating a toroidal topology , as in figure 1a .",
    "the exterior universe will maintain this topology with two compact and one infinite spatial dimensions .    when @xmath19 , the @xmath17 sector is a space with constant negative curvature , also known as a hyperbolic plane , a discussion of which is available in balasz and voros @xcite .",
    "geodesics are intersections between the hyperbolic plane and planes through the origin . a compact surface is formed from the hyperbolic plane by identifying opposite sides of a suitable polygon whose edges are geodesics .",
    "the polygon must have a minimum of eight sides , and the number of sides must be a multiple of four to avoid conical singularities .",
    "an identified polygon with @xmath20 sides is of genus @xmath3 .",
    "the genus determines the topology of the compact space .",
    "the surface genus @xmath21 has two ` holes ' , and so is a double - holed doughnut or a pacifier . the surface with @xmath22",
    "has three ` holes ' and has a pretzel shape , and so on , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "this type of identification of hyperbolic surfaces is described in more detail in @xcite .",

    "the universe outside the fluid maintains the same topology of the cloud boundary itself .",
    "the fluid forms a pacifier within a pacifier with the holes lined up , or the banana cream in our doughnut , if you will .",
    "the situation is analogous for higher genus topologies . beyond the cloud",
    ", the radial coordinate may range to infinity .",
    "the standard metric of an arbitrary , static spacetime with spherical , toroidal or hyperbolic symmetry was used in conjunction with the einstein equations to generate interior solutions .",

    "here , @xmath25 is the time coordinate , @xmath26 is the radial coordinate , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are coordinates on a two - surface of constant positive , zero or negative curvature , where @xmath28 has a range of @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "the matching of the metrics is analogous to that in @xcite , and is carried out under the conditions that the metrics and the extrinsic curvatures match smoothly across the boundary .",
    "the cosmological constant will be absorbed into definitions of the density and pressure , so that = _ m - | | 8 g , p = p_m + | | 8 g , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the density and pressure due to matter respectively .",

    "where @xmath39 is the appropriate angular spatial section .",
    "the behavior at small @xmath26 will depend on the parameters , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , as well as the value of @xmath37 .",

    "a finite throat refers to the situation in which the radial coordinate reaches a minimal value at some finite distance from the outer edge of the fluid , and then expands again into another universe . in the genus @xmath4 case a series of spheres of smaller and smaller proper radii",
    "are encountered , as an observer travels into the star .",
    "eventually a sphere of minimum size is encountered , beyond which the spheres begin to grow once more . in the genus @xmath45 case ,",
    "the situation is the same , except that the spheres are replaced with pseudospheres ( or planes ) which are identified under the action of a discrete isometry group , as described in section 2 .",
    "hence the spacetime within the fluid has a wormhole structure , and may be matched at each end of the wormhole ( where @xmath46 ) to an exterior spacetime whose metric is given by ( [ extmet ] ) .    in the infinite trumpet ,",

    "when @xmath4 , @xmath18 and the parameter @xmath77 is forced to be positive . when @xmath78 , @xmath19 , implying @xmath79 .",
    "the equation for the pressure becomes , for any genus , p = ( - k 3 k - ) , provided @xmath80 . the analogous buchdahl identity , found by demanding that the pressure is positive definite , is then 1/3 < k 1 for all @xmath26 .    when @xmath81 , the left hand equality demands that @xmath82 but maintaining a metric with the correct signature throughout requires @xmath83 .",
    "this contradiction rules out the possibility of a genus @xmath6 stable star with @xmath80 and positive pressure everywhere .",
    "when @xmath65 is constant , the parameters @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 from section [ vrho ] may still be nonzero .",
    "the behavior of the solution will depend on the character of the lower cutoff of the positive region of @xmath84 being examined .",
    "if that function is cut off by a double or triple root , an infinite throat will result . if the region in which the function if positive is ended by the y - axis , a cusp will be formed .",
    "if , however , the function has a non - degenerate , positive root as the lower bound to its positive region , the star will have a finite throat , with a minimum radius given by that root .",
    "none of these wormholes will have a well behaved pressure for a positive matter density .",
    "note that we can rewrite ( [ psol ] ) as [ psol2 ] p_m = _ m - 4 _ m _ r^r d ( ^2 + b + / ) ^3 2 - _ m. the first term in the denominator varies from a value of unity at the outer radius to zero at the throat .",
    "the integral in the second term is a well - behaved positive function , so the second term will be zero at the outer radius and some positive number at the throat . to see this , approximate the behavior of the term near a single root , @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath86    it is therefore unavoidable that the two terms in the denominator will become equal at some value of @xmath26 , at which point the pressure will be infinite",
    ". this type of wormhole can never be stable .",
    "sample plots displaying this behavior were obtained by numerical integration , and are shown in figure 2 .",
    "wormhole solutions have long been known to require the existence of exotic matter ( matter which violates the weak energy condition ) @xcite , so it is not surprising that this case also requires such .",
    "a study of wormhole solutions in topologically trivial spacetimes with nonzero cosmological constant also led to this conclusion , although the actual conditions on the exotic matter are modified @xcite .",
    "the necessity of exotic matter is an unpleasant but not prohibitive situation , the casimir effect being perhaps the best known example of a manifestation of the violation of the energy conditions .",
    "the most likely situation in which topological black holes have physical relevance is in the early universe @xcite is also one in which quantum fluctuations may produce ( temporarily at least ) regions in which the weak energy condition is violated .",
    "it is therefore natural to consider in more detail topological `` stars '' in which the energy conditions are violated .",
    "indeed , a study of a dust cloud of negative energy density indicated that exotic matter may behave in a counter - intuitive manner , collapsing to form black holes @xcite .",
    "the simplest case which requires @xmath29 to be negative is that for which the parameter @xmath68 vanishes , as referred to earlier .",
    "the behavior of the pressure in this situation is representative of the more complicated @xmath87 cases . here",
    "the matter density is forced to be negative in order that the metric be real .",
    "the pressure takes on the simple form p_m = - |_m | ( - - ) . in this case",
    "the pressure is well - behaved .",
    "it vanishes at the star s edge and decreases to a finite central value at @xmath88 .",
    "the pressure here is always negative , so in fact it is a tension . generalizing the constraint from ref.@xcite to include negative matter pressure and density yields [ hcon ] dp_m d _ m 0 .",
    "this will guarantee that the matter pressure @xmath30 must become more negative as the matter density becomes more negative , as is a physically reasonable .",
    "this constraint may also be interpreted as a limit on the matter density , since when it becomes too negative the inequality will no longer hold throughout the star .",
    "this constraint is most easily evaluated numerically .",
    "[ f3a ]    the behavior of the matter pressure when @xmath64 is non - zero is qualitatively similar .",
    "the function is well - behaved , zero at the outer edge and finite at the throat .",
    "the same constraint ( [ hcon ] ) as before is employed to produce physically reasonable results .",
    "the strongest constraint arises at a radius near the throat radius , as was done in figure 3 .",
    "although the collapse of a pressureless dust cloud of positive energy to a topological black hole proceeds in a manner somewhat analogous that in the usual spherical case ( with genus @xmath4 ) @xcite , the formation of stable central structures in topologically non - trivial anti de sitter spacetimes differs considerably from the topologically trivial case .",
    "indeed geometric requirements are in conflict with energy positivity requirements , implying that there are no stable central structures formed from a perfect fluid respecting the energy conditions and whose exterior metric is given by ( [ extmet ] ) .",
    "the only `` stable '' solutions are those in which the matter density within the star is negative , with a magnitude smaller than a critical value determined by ( [ hcon ] ) . in the case",
    "the topological star consists of a fluid of gravitationally repulsive negative energy , held together by a sufficiently large tension ( i.e. negative pressure ) .",
    "both pressure and density are finite everywhere throughout the star .",
    "this is the reverse of a normal star , whose gravitationally self - attractive density is prevented from collapsing by its pressure .",
    "should the pressure of the negative - mass star decrease below a certain threshold during its evolution , it will either explode due to gravitational self - repulsion or collapse to a black hole of negative mass .",
    "the former situation will occur if the magnitude of the density is sufficiently large relative to @xmath89 .",
    "otherwise the evolution of the star should proceed along the lines described in ref .",
    "@xcite , ultimately reaching a black hole of negative mass as its final state .",
    "the most likely physical situation in which any of these scenarios is relevant is in the early universe .",
    "topological black holes can be formed via pair - production in the presence of domain walls @xcite or from the collapse of a dust cloud ( of either positive or negative density ) in a topologically suitable setting @xcite . however ,",
    "if it is possible to produce exotic matter in such settings , the results of this paper indicate that stable ( wormhole - type ) central structures can form .",
