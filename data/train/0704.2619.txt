    "we notice that this approximation reproduce more closely the spacing distributions and the correlation function .",
    "the iia correlation function has an oscillatory behavior near at @xmath128 as it occurs in the gas and spin system .",
    "although the predictions are not identical , the iia gives a good approximation for the correlation function and spacing distributions with an error of a few percents ( 5% ) deviation from the numerical results for the gas and the spin system .",
    "the fact that the independent interval approximation reproduce much better the correlation function and spacing distributions of the gas and the spin system than the other approaches considered ( crw , irw and coe ) , suggest that in the gas and spin systems the domains are not strongly correlated .

    "we studied two out of equilibrium systems , the gas and spin system , which present a formation of growing domains .",
    "we studied the statistical properties of the edges of the domains in the scaling regime and compared them with several other models . since in the scaling regime",
    "the statistical properties of the edges of the domains are time independent , when properly rescaled , we tried to find if there exists an equilibrium statistical system which reproduce these statistics .",
    "a first candidate was the circular orthogonal ensemble of random matrices ( coe ) , since the scaling size distribution of the domains satisfies the wigner surmise .",
    "studying the other spacing distributions @xmath15 and the correlation function , we found that only the nearest neighbor distribution ( @xmath163 ) coincides for the gas system , the spin system , the coe and the models of coalescing and interacting random walkers ( crw and irw ) which were introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to explain the properties of the gas system .",
    "the distribution functions @xmath15 for @xmath130 and the correlation function are different for each of these systems .",
    "the nearest neighbor distribution for the coalescing random walk is obtained by solving the diffusion equation with an absorbing condition in @xmath164  @xcite , and the scaling solution turns out to be given by eq .",
    "( [ dgoe ] ) . as a side note , it is interesting to notice that , up to a normalization , this is the wave function of the first excited state of the harmonic oscillator , an analogy that has been used in the context of persistence , see ref .",
    "our work shows that it is merely a coincidence that this nearest neighbor distribution turns out to be the wigner distribution from the random matrices theory .",
    "we found a model which provides a better approximation for the gas and the spin system domain statistics .",
    "this model is the independent interval approximation , even though in this approximation the correlation between domains is not taken into account as it occurs in interacting and coalescing random walk .",
    "the independent interval approximation is statistically equivalent to an equilibrium system of particles with only nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "the fact that the wigner surmise , eq .",
    "( [ dgoe ] ) , reproduces correctly the nearest neighbor spacing distribution of all the different systems we considered here , but that the other spacing distributions differ from system to system , seems to show that the nearest neighbor distribution has some kind of universality while the other distributions do not .",
    "however , it can also be interpreted as an indication that the nearest neighbor distribution does not contain enough information about the statistics of the system : several different systems could share the same nearest neighbor distribution , while the finer details and differences between them are contained in the correlation function and the other spacing distributions .",
    "this is the most important result of this paper , because in many cases complex systems are mapped onto more simple systems with the only criteria of the nearest neighbor distribution similitude .",
