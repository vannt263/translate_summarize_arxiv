    "there are several studies @xcite in the last few years to estimate the potential for measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters at future atmospheric neutrino experiments , particularly , using a large magnetized iron calorimeter detector proposed at india - based neutrino observatory @xcite .",
    "the results are significantly different from one to another and there is almost no clarification why they differ significantly . recently , in @xcite and @xcite , _ the reach of this experiment for the measurement of the atmospheric neutrino parameters has been reported . _",
    "the results are significantly underestimated and drastically different from earlier analysis @xcite . for an example , for input inverted hierarchy ( ih ) ,",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , the sensitivity to discrimination of mass hierarchy ( @xmath6 ) for 20 years of ino data is 8.5 without marginalization and flux uncertainties @xcite ( see figure 4 in @xcite ) and 13.5 with marginalization in @xcite ( see figure 5 in @xcite keeping in mind that the marginalization range is wider than present @xmath7 range ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to point out the factors in the analysis techniques , which lead to the large differences .",
    "the result of a statistical analysis of the experimental data depends strongly on the method of binning of the data @xcite . in this experiment",
    "the survival probability @xmath8 as a function of baseline ( @xmath9 ) and energy @xmath10 will be measured in terms of number of events for @xmath11 and @xmath12 separately .",
    "the variation of @xmath8 in @xmath13 plane is shown in figure [ f : pmumu ] for a given set of oscillation parameters : @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the binning of the data should be such that it should produce maximum sensitivity to @xmath8 with the changes of oscillation parameters . to find the sensitivity of one parameter which even may be sensitive only in a small part of @xmath13 space",
    ", one needs to marginalize the @xmath16 over the whole allowed ranges of all other oscillation parameters as they are uncertain over the allowed ranges ; and the whole region in @xmath13 plane contributes to its sensitivity due to dependence of other oscillation parameters on whole @xmath13 region . for an example",
    ", the mass hierarchy is sensitive to some small regions of @xmath13 plane ( see figure [ f : pmumu ] and also @xcite ) ; but , @xmath17 and @xmath1 , are sensitive over whole @xmath13 plane .",
    "the distance between two consecutive oscillation peaks @xmath18 ( @xmath19 along @xmath20-axis for a given fixed value of @xmath21 increases with increase in @xmath22 ( see figure [ f : pmumu ] ) , which again changes with the change of oscillation parameters . if the bin size is equal or bigger than this distance , the oscillation effect is averaged out and the sensitivity to the oscillation parameters falls significantly .",
    "it requires varying ( gradually decreasing ) bin size with decrease in @xmath22 .",
    "even if the resolution is worse ( bin size @xmath23 resolution width ) , the result would improve with decrease in bin size",
    ". the improvement may be very small after certain bin size , but would not create any problem unless the number of events in a bin is less than the number of minimum required events ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "this is required to have @xmath16 per degrees of freedom @xmath25 .",
    "there are six oscillation peaks in @xmath22 range 1  2 gev for @xmath26 km ; but , if one considers only 1 or 2 bin ( as done in @xcite ) , the oscillation effect is then fully averaged out . in @xcite",
    "the bin size for @xmath22 is 1 gev , the oscillation effect is averaged out for @xmath27 gev , and the crisis of number of events in a bin begins to maintain number of events @xmath28 for @xmath29 , which becomes serious when @xmath30 10 gev .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the binning is done with equal bin size in @xmath31 , the problem of averaging out of oscillation probability is reduced for @xmath32 4 gev and the number of events per bin does not reduce drastically for @xmath29 gev ( flux @xmath33 ) .",
    "one can now consider all high energy events ( @xmath34 gev ) in the analysis ( as the bin size is large for high @xmath22 ) , which would increase the sensitivity drastically in spite of less number of events , but due to high angular resolutions ( see resolutions due to kinematics of scattering in @xcite ) .",
    "the sensitivity ( @xmath16 ) to oscillation parameters will be maximized when the binning is done with equal bin size in @xmath31 and and the sensitivity will increase significantly even with only 10 bins ( 10 bins in @xmath22 are considered in@xcite ) .",
    "but , decreasing bin size with equal binning in @xmath22 could not improve the sensitivity significantly as the bin size can not be made less than @xmath35 for @xmath36 gev maintaining number of events @xmath28 for @xmath29 gev .",
    "again , from figure [ f : pmumu ] , it is clear that matter effect is not negligible for @xmath210 gev . here ,",
    "the distance between two peaks in @xmath37 10gev for @xmath26 km and it increases for lower values of @xmath9 . obviously",
    ", one can easily consider bin size in @xmath22 much much higher than 1 gev , and then number of events in a bin will @xmath28 and sensitivity will increase significantly .",
    "the muon energy and angle resolutions at magnetized iron calorimeter ( ical ) are very good over almost whole @xmath13 regions except a small region at the near horizon . however , these resolutions are very negligible compared to the resolutions due to kinematics of the neutrino scattering processes for whole region of @xmath13 plane and even at near horizon ( see energy angle correlated resolutions in the plane consists of @xmath38 and @xmath39 in @xcite and compare it with the resolutions of muons for ical in @xcite ) .",
    "the energy resolution can not fully average out the oscillation pattern as @xmath35 is larger than the resolution width in ( @xmath40 ) for whole range of @xmath22 above 1 gev , even with considering muon resolution of ical detector except the region at near horizon . for @xmath41 1 gev",
    ", @xmath35 is very small ; but , @xmath38 is also very small ( @xmath42 ) as events are mostly from quasi - elastic process ( see figure 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "if the bin size in @xmath22 is less than @xmath35 , it will contribute significantly to the sensitivity to the oscillation parameters .    on the other hand ,",
    "though the angular resolution width in @xmath39 is large at @xmath43 1 gev , but it decreases very rapidly with increase in @xmath44 and resolutions in @xmath39 becomes smaller than the distance between two peaks in @xmath45 for @xmath46 gev .",
    "again , for events where muons are going near vertically , the change of @xmath9 ( @xmath47 ) with @xmath48 is relatively small around the vertical axis than the change in the near horizon ( see figure [ f : pmumu ] ) , but the resolution @xmath49 ( due to kinematics ) remains same .",
    "moreover , for event going vertically the distribution of the event on the both side of the vertical axis due to smearing of resolution will fall twice in a @xmath9 bin ( equal angles around the vertical axis produce same @xmath9 ) . in spite of wide angular resolutions",
    ", this will enhance the sensitivity compared to the events far away from this zone .",
    "there is 7% increase of events after incorporation of resolutions in @xcite ( see table 3 in @xcite ) , which may shift the best - fit values significantly from their true values . in @xcite the resolutions are incorporated bin wise , the number of events of a bin is smeared using gaussian resolution function considering the central value of the bin . again .",
    "the number of @xmath47 bins for smearing resolutions as well as @xmath16 analysis are same ; which reduces the effect of resolution from the actual one .    the angular resolution function has been constructed in @xmath47 in @xcite .",
    "it would not be a fully gaussian for nearly vertical events , it will ends at @xmath50 .",
    "but , in @xcite the smearing has been done using a gaussian resolution in @xmath51 considering standard deviation @xmath52 obtained from geant - based simulation ( see eq . 7 of @xcite ) .",
    "the smearing of the event by integrating over @xmath53 to @xmath54 and adding the contribution to the last bin will overestimate the number of events in that bin and underestimate in all other bins .",
    "this will distort the event distribution and misplace the best - fits of oscillation parameters from their true values due to large tail of gaussian functions as the resolution width is not always much smaller than the bin size .",
    "the muon looses energy due to mainly ionization and atomic excitation for @xmath55 a few gev .",
    "so , in case of fully contained ( fc ) events the path length traversed in a medium is proportional to its energy .",
    "on the other hand , in magnetic field the muon track bends with increasing curvature along its track as its energy decreases gradually . in case of fc events one can measure the energy from effective path length ( density times path length ) as well as from curvature .",
    "the measurement of curvature depends strongly on precision of the determination of hit positions in the active elements of the detector .",
    "this dependence is relatively less in case of measurement of track length .",
    "so , it is highly expected that _ the energy resolution from track length will be much better than from curvature .",
    "_ moreover , as muon energy increases the curvature decreases and resolution width will increase with energy .",
    "but , ( @xmath56 ) is then expected not to increase with energy ( at least for @xmath57 a few tens of gev ) for fc events if it measured from effective path length ( as the relative error in measurement of track length decreases with its increase in magnitude ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the muon energy for partially contained ( pc ) events can only be measured from curvature . if the track is not long and/or energy is high ( bending is small ) , the measurement of energy will be poor in compared to fc events . the muon energy resolutions for pc events",
    "would obviously be wider significantly in comparison to the fc events .",
    "it is not mentioned in the papers @xcite that the fully contained ( fc ) and partially contained ( pc ) events are treated separately in construction of resolution functions . as muon energy increases the number of pc events begins to increase and becomes larger than fc events .",
    "this may be one of the main reason why muon energy resolution is significantly worsened for @xmath30 5 gev in energy resolution plots in @xcite .",
    "there would not appear significant difference in muon angular resolutions between fc and pc events .",
    "one can show that with only fc events one can get better sensitivity than the combined one with fc and pc events .",
    "the result will improve with pc events only when they are treated separately .",
    "as i find , this fact ( which belongs to physics analysis , not to the construction of resolution functions ) has not been discussed in @xmath16 analysis or in any part of the papers @xcite .",
    "the same procedure ( using smearing of resolutions ) is used to generate both experimental data set as well as theoretical data set .",
    "if one _ demands the results as a reach of an experiment or from detector simulation , _ then the experimental data set should be obtained from directly reconstructing events . in analysis of actual experimental data , sensitivity as well as",
    "the best - fits will be significantly different due to the the above method of incorporation of resolutions . in my opinion the simplest and best way to do the analysis is without using any resolution function , but directly reconstructing all events of large number of ical events ( say , 10000 years of data ) for one time and then incorporating oscillation and reducing the number of events according to the exposure time .",
    "the muon detection efficiency is @xmath58 over almost whole region except at the near horizon where the efficiency is much less and up going and down going events are mixed up due to wide resolutions and the contribution to the @xmath16 is expected to be significantly small compared to the region away from horizon .",
    "this has been discussed in detail with results using different horizontal cuts in sec .",
    "vii.d in @xcite .",
    "the results can not be significantly worsened due to much less efficiency at near horizon .",
    "the effect of flux uncertainties on the sensitivity to oscillation parameters is marginal for @xmath59 gev . for @xmath59 gev",
    ", there is mainly overall flux normalization uncertainty and the effect would be minimized by the pull method of @xmath16 if the bin size in both @xmath9 and @xmath22 are much less than @xmath18 and @xmath35 , respectively . in section 5.2 of @xcite",
    "we have shown that the effect of it on the sensitivities to @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and mass hierarchy are very marginal in contrary with @xcite .",
    "1 .   _ @xmath0 : _ the sensitivity to @xmath0 comes from the measuring of @xmath18 and @xmath35 .",
    "it requires bin size in @xmath9 ( @xmath22 ) much smaller than @xmath18 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "@xmath1 : _ the sensitivity to deviation from maximal mixing ( @xmath60 ) comes from whole region of @xmath13 and the sensitivity to octant ( @xmath61 ) comes from depleted region as shown in figure [ f : pmumu ] due to the matter effect ( discussed in detail in @xcite ) .",
    "3 .   _ @xmath15 : _ the sensitivity to @xmath15 arises from the events with @xmath62 .",
    "however , the contribution to @xmath16 from events @xmath63 gev is negligible due to i ) tilt uncertainty in flux for @xmath64 gev and ii ) drastic increase of scattering angle @xmath49 with decrease in @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "@xmath65 and mass hierarchy : _ the coupling between solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillation occurs through @xmath65 , then the sensitivity is expected to come from i ) @xmath66gev and also from ii ) the depleted regions due to matter effect . due to the issues discussed in above",
    ", the sensitivity from events with @xmath66gev is negligible ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the reach of the ino experiment for measurement of oscillation parameters reported in @xcite are significantly underestimated and drastically different from previous studies @xcite due to improper binning of the data , improper incorporation of resolutions , rejection of high energy events @xmath67 10 gev .",
    "the effects on oscillation probability due to the changes of oscillation parameters are not reflected fully in the @xmath16 analysis .",
