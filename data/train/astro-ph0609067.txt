    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are homogeneous stellar systems containing stars with a single age and metallicity , which are in principle simpler to interpret than photometric and spectroscopic observations of the integrated stellar light of a galaxy .",
    "gcs are therefore considered to be powerful probes with which to understand the star formation and chemical enrichment history of their host galaxy .",
    "one of the basic findings from observations about gc populations in luminous galaxies is that while thousands of gcs are associated with luminous elliptical galaxies , a significantly smaller number of gcs exist around spiral galaxies with similar luminosities ( e.g. , harris 1991 ; barmby 2003 ) .",
    "this indicates that the specific frequency of gcs ( @xmath18 ) , which is considered to be related to the relative efficiency of gc formation and/or survival compared to galactic halo / bulge stars , depends on galaxy morphology .",
    "in fact , @xmath18 has also been suggested to be correlated with local galaxy density , with galaxies in denser environments having larger @xmath18 values ( west 1993 ) .",
    "the fact that this trend appears to exist even when the sample of galaxies is restricted to ellipticals suggests that gc formation efficiency is more physically linked with galaxy environment .",
    "one possibility to explain this observation is biased gc formation in galaxies inhabiting denser environments ( west 1993 ; blakeslee 1999 ; mclaughlin 1999 ) .",
    "alternatively , a substantial number of gcs in a luminous galaxy may have an external origin ; gcs could be captured from other galaxies through galaxy interactions and accrete onto luminous galaxies in clusters , which would then enhance @xmath18 values as observed .",
    "recent studies of gcs in the central regions of luminous ellipticals conducted with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) have revealed that many luminous ellipticals have bimodal or multimodal colour distributions of gcs ( gebhardt & kissler - patig 1999 ; larsen et al .",
    "2001 ; brodie et al .",
    "it is found that the mean colours of both red ( metal - rich ) and blue ( metal - poor ) gc subpopulations are correlated with the host galaxy luminosities and colours ( larsen et al .",
    "2001 ; strader , brodie & forbes 2004 ; strader et al . 2005 ; peng et al .",
    "2006 ) , which will be important constraints on the proposed scenarios for the formation and evolution of gc population such as multiphase collapse scenario ( forbes , brodie & grillmair 1997 ) , merger scenario ( ashman & zepf 1992 ) , hiearchical merging scenario ( beasley et al . 2002 ) , and accretion scenario ( ct , marzke & west 1998 ) .",
    "the small field of view of the hst , however , does not allow one to collect gc populations in the outer halo of a galaxy and investigate their spatial structures , which will also be key pieces of the puzzle ( e.g. , moore et al . 2005 ) .",
    "much wider - field studies ( e.g. , out to @xmath4 100 kpc from the galaxy centre ) of gc populations therefore need to be performed using ground - based data ( rhode & zepf 2001 , 2004 ; dirsch et al .",
    "2003 ; bassino et al .",
    "studying gc populations at large distances from the host galaxy is of great importance because the outer halo of the host galaxy , and even the intergalactic space , are presumed to be large reservoirs of blue and metal - poor gcs in the accretion scenario .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in fig . [ gclf_cor ] , gclfs obtained within annuli centered on m87 are presented .",
    "the dotted lines indicate raw gclfs without incompleteness correction or control field subtraction , and the thin black lines show gclfs after the incompleteness is corrected for ( but no subtractive correction for contamination is performed yet ) .",
    "the red ( thick black ) lines show gclfs after the control field subtraction is also performed based on the hdf - n ( lh ) field , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ gclf ] , the gclfs after the incompleteness correction and field subtraction using the hdf - n data are divided into red ( @xmath22 ) and blue ( @xmath15 ) gc subpopulations .",
    "the black line shows the gclf for the total gc population ( blue @xmath23 red ) .",
    "the boundary colour of the blue and red gcs corresponds approximately to the middle of the peak colours in the bimodal colour distributions ( see paper ii ) .",
    "note that there is a local maximum of gc number in the @xmath24 bin due to the gc population of ngc 4552 at a distance of @xmath4 75@xmath20 from m87 .",
    "gclfs in the outermost regions tend to have some negative bins due to the field subtraction . in both of these figures ,",
    "the shaded region indicates the magnitude range where the completeness is lower than 50 % .",
    "note that the completeness is calculated by considering not only the simple detection completeness on the @xmath1 band image but also the selection efficiency of unresolved objects based on the ` class_star ` index and the completeness in @xmath0 and @xmath2 bands at the corresponding magnitudes depending on the gc colours .",
    "we investigate and discuss the spatial distributions of gc populations in detail in paper ii .",
    "a gaussian fitted to the gclf obtained using only gcs at distances smaller than @xmath21 ( @xmath4 45 kpc ) from the host galaxy is plotted in fig .",
    "[ gauss ] ( we fit a gaussian to the binned data ) .",
    "the fainter part of the gclf in the shaded region where the completeness is lower than 50 % is not used in this fitting process . the turnover magnitude ( @xmath10 ) and dispersion ( @xmath25 ) of the gclf",
    "are then estimated to be @xmath26 mag and @xmath27 mag for the gc population in m87 .",
    "for the ngc 4552 gcs , @xmath28 and @xmath29 mag . in fig .",
    "[ gclfcol ] , the gclfs of the red and blue gc subpopulations are shown with fitted gaussians . again",
    "the shaded region indicates the magnitude range where the completeness calculated by using all the gcs ( i.e. , blue @xmath23 red ) is lower than 50 % . this limiting magnitude does not change a lot if only the red or blue gc subpopulation is considered since our b- and i - band images are deep enough not to miss a significant number of red or blue globular clusters detected on the v - band image .",
    "the fitted gaussians suggest that the gclf depends on subpopulation ; the @xmath10 of the red gc subpopulation is @xmath30 mag and 0.4 mag fainter than that of the blue one for m87 and ngc 4552 , respectively , although the results for the ngc 4552 gcs are less significant due to the large errors .",
    "larsen et al . ( 2001 ) present similar results using the hst / wfpc2 data , although their @xmath10 values tend to be brighter than those from other studies .",
    "this difference of @xmath10 between the gc subpopulations is perhaps because of a metallicity difference ( ashman , conti & zepf 1995 ; elson & santiago 1996 ; jordn et al .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath25 of the gclfs are summarized in table [ gclfparams ] .",
    "the gcs within @xmath21 of m87 are further divided into two samples at a boundary of @xmath31 and the gclfs of all gcs , red gcs , and blue gcs in the inner and outer regions are presented in fig .",
    "[ gclfinout ] .",
    "gaussians are also fitted to these gclfs and the @xmath10 and @xmath25 are summarized in table [ gclfparams ] .",
    "this indicates that the shape of gclf is not significantly different between the inner region ( @xmath16 ) and the outer region ( @xmath17 ) for red gcs or blue gcs .",
    "furthermore , the gclf shape for all gcs is consistent with that in the core region ( @xmath32 ) obtained by kundu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) using hst / wfpc2 : @xmath33 mag ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "this suggests that the gclf shape of the m87 gcs is not a strong function of distance from the host galaxy .",
    "we note that the fainter part of the gclf for all gcs tends to be more deficient at the larger distance ; this is due to the lower contribution of the red gc subpopulation in the outer region .",
    "any radial dependence of the gclf is unclear for the gc population around ngc 4552 because the number of gcs is not substantial enough especially in the outer region ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath10 of the gclf obtained at @xmath36 is consistent with that in the core region obtained by kundu & whitmore ( 2001 ) using hst / wfpc2 who found @xmath37 mag with a fixed value of @xmath38 , again suggesting that the gclf shape does not depend significantly on distance from the host galaxy .      using the @xmath10 and @xmath25 of the gaussians fitted to the gclfs presented in fig .",
    "[ gauss ] , we can estimate the total number of gcs associated with m87 or ngc 4552 and calculate a gc specific frequency ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "we first integrate a gclf obtained in an annulus ( @xmath39 width ) centered on the host galaxy down to the magnitude where the completeness becomes 50 % .",
    "this number is then multiplied by a correction factor to include the fainter gcs based on the gaussian gclf .",
    "this calculation is repeated out to a certain distance from the galaxy centre .",
    "we note that it is ideal to fit a gaussian to a gclf obtained in each annulus but this is difficult in practice , especially at large distances because the number of gcs is not substantial and statistical errors are significant .",
    "we therefore use the fitted gaussian in the inner region ( @xmath40 ) of m87 or ngc 4552 independently of the distance from the host galaxy . in order to estimate the number of gcs at distances smaller than @xmath32 , where the brightness of host galaxy halo light exceeds the linearity regime of the ccd , the radial profile of gc surface density outside the core region",
    "is fitted with a de vaucouleurs law profile ( see paper ii for details ) and the fitted formula is extrapolated towards the galaxy centre .",
    "the estimated total number of m87 gcs is @xmath41 within @xmath42 from the galaxy centre ( cf .",
    "@xmath43 by hhm ) . for ngc 4552",
    ", the total number of gcs is estimated to be @xmath44 within @xmath21 .",
    "note that the fraction of gcs at @xmath45 estimated from the extrapolation is 8.5 % for m87 gcs and 17 % for ngc 4552 gcs .",
    "if we adopt @xmath46 mag as the @xmath1-band absolute magnitude of m87 , which is also adopted by hhm ( a difference in adopted distance modulus of 0.03 mag is corrected ) , the @xmath18 value of m87 is calculated to be @xmath47 , which is only slightly smaller than @xmath48 obtained by hhm .",
    "the @xmath1-band luminosity of ngc 4552 is obtained from our data by fitting a de vaucouleurs law to the @xmath1-band surface brightness profile and integrating it out to the same distance ( 10@xmath20 ) ; @xmath49 mag .",
    "the @xmath18 value of ngc 4552 is then estimated to be @xmath50 . within 10@xmath20 for ngc 4552 to avoid possible contributions of m87 gcs and intergalactic gcs outside of this radius ( see paper ii ) .",
    "if we fit a de vaucouleurs law to the gc surface density profile within 10@xmath20 from the ngc 4552 centre and integrate it out to 25@xmath20 as done for m87 gcs , the number of gcs and @xmath18 are estimated to be @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively . ]",
    "we have performed a wide - field imaging survey of the globular cluster ( gc ) populations around m87 with suprime - cam on the 8.2 m subaru telescope .",
    "a @xmath53 ( 560 kpc @xmath54 140 kpc ) field extending from m87 to the east was observed through the @xmath7 filters .",
    "in addition to this unprecedented large survey area , our data analysis has been optimized to study the statistical properties of gcs as follows :    * gc candidates are isolated not only with an extended source cut but also with a colour cut , where only unresolved objects falling on a specific region of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 colour - colour diagram are accepted .",
    "the colour criterion is defined so as to include almost all the galactic gcs and to avoid foreground stars and background galaxies .",
    "this is expected to efficiently isolate bona - fide gcs from other unresolved objects on our imaging data . * in order to assess foreground and background contamination which needs to be statistically subtracted , we analyze the imaging data on the hdf - n field and the lockman hole field as control field data .",
    "these fields cover reasonably wide sky areas ( @xmath55 ) and are compatible with the data of the m87 fields in terms of the filter set ( @xmath7 ) , limiting magnitudes , and image qualities .",
    "we therefore extract contaminating populations using identical criteria to those adopted in the m87 fields , minimizing the possibility of introducing any systematic errors into the subtractive correction .    in this paper",
    ", we have investigated the luminosity function and global specific frequency ( @xmath18 ) of gc candidates surrounding m87 or ngc 4552 .",
    "the @xmath1-band gc luminosity functions ( gclfs ) were obtained in the inner regions of m87 and ngc 4552 at distances @xmath40 from the galaxy centres . by fitting gaussians to the gclfs , the turnover magnitude is estimated to be @xmath11 mag for m87 gcs and @xmath56 mag for ngc 4552 gcs .",
    "the gclf appears to depend on gc colour ; the turnover magnitude in the gclf of the red gc subpopulation ( @xmath22 ) is @xmath4 0.5 mag and 0.4 mag fainter than that of the blue gc subpopulation ( @xmath15 ) for the m87 gcs and ngc 4552 gcs , respectively .    for the m87 gcs ,",
    "the gclfs at @xmath16 were compared with those at @xmath17 but no obvious trend with radius was found in the shape of the gclf for either the red or blue subpopulations .",
    "the global @xmath18 of m87 gcs and ngc 4552 gcs is estimated to be 12.5 @xmath19 0.8 within @xmath42 and 5.0 @xmath19 0.6 within @xmath21 , respectively .",
