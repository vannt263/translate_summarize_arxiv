    "a problem of current interest is the study of moving vortices interacting with arrays of pinning centers .",
    "random arrays have received the most attention . however , periodic pinning arrays are also of interest .",
    "one reason is that they provide examples of dynamical phases and phase transitions , a subject not yet fully understood , where theoretical predictions can be tested in superconducting films with artificial defect lattices@xcite , and in josephson junction arrays ( jja)@xcite .    in the case of moving vortices interacting with random pinning arrays ,",
    "the dynamics is simpler when the driving force is large , in which case the velocity of the center of mass ( cm ) of the vortex array is also large .",
    "this situation was first considered by schmid and hauger@xcite who suggested that fast moving vortices average out the pinning potential and , consequently , order in a triangular lattice at low temperatures . in experiments",
    "@xcite and numerical simulations@xcite nearly triangular lattices are indeed observed at large cm velocity .",
    "koshlev and vinokur @xcite analyzed the effects of random pinning at large cm velocities on vortex displacement from the lattice equilibrium positions .",
    "they argued that it is equivalent to a `` shaking '' temperature , inversely proportional to the cm velocity , that adds to the thermodynamic temperature , and predicted that dynamical melting of the moving vortex lattice takes place when the cm velocity is such that the combined temperature equals the equilibrium melting temperature .",
    "recently , gianmarchi and le doussal @xcite pointed out that this picture for the large cm velocities behavior breaks down , because the vortices order in a moving glass , rather than in a moving triangular lattice .",
    "the reason is that averaging of the pinning potential by the fast moving vortices is only partial .",
    "a static random pinning potential remains acting on the vortices in the frame of reference moving with the cm velocity ( cm frame ) , and has non - trivial consequences on vortex order .",
    "these authors predict that the vortices move along static channels , on average parallel to the direction of drive , and are pinned on them with respect to a transverse force at zero temperature .",
    "this is referred to as transverse pinning .",
    "these predictions are in agreement with experimental and numerical results @xcite .    in the case of vortices interacting with periodic pinning ,",
    "the dynamics also simplifies in the limit of large driving forces .",
    "the question of what happens to the dynamical phases in this limit was first examined in recent publications by the author @xcite .",
    "these papers consider pinning by a square lattice of columnar defects ( cd ) , and vortex motion in the [ 0,1 ] ( or [ 1,0 ] ) direction . in refs .",
    "it is argued that moving vortices average the periodic pinning potential only in the direction of motion .",
    "it is also argued that the dynamical phases reduce to the equilibrium ones for vortices interacting with the periodic pinning potential averaged in the direction of motion , that is [ 0,1 ] , which is a washboard , periodic in the [ 1,0 ] direction .",
    "this was shown to have non - trivial consequences for the dynamical phase diagram .",
    "the present paper studies further the limit of large drives for the model introduced in ref . , allowing for arbitrary directions of vortex motion , and covering a wide temperature range .",
    "the dynamical phases in this limit are found to play a central role in determining the whole dynamical phase diagram .",
    "previous theoretical studies of vortices interacting with periodic pinning arrays are mostly numerical .",
    "extensive studies of the zero - temperature vortex dynamics in systems with cd - lattices , carried out by several workers @xcite , find a rather complex behavior , with many dynamical phases and phase transitions .",
    "a simpler finite - temperature behavior is found in jja and films .",
    "marconi and domimguez @xcite carried out numerical simulations of square jja , with the driving force along the [ 1,0 ] ( or [ 0,1 ] ) direction .",
    "they find three dynamical phases : two moving vortex lattices and a moving liquid . in all three ,",
    "the cm velocity is along the direction of drive .",
    "the lattices have the same spatial order , but differ from each other by the response to a force transverse to the direction of motion .",
    "one lattice , named transversely pinned vortex lattice , is pinned ( transverse pinning ) , and the other , named floating solid , is unpinned . dynamical melting of the floating solid into the liquid , and dynamical depinning from the pinned lattice to the floating solid are reported .",
    "further work @xcite predicts transverse pinning only for driving forces along [ 1,0 ] ( or [ 0,1 ] ) , and verify it experimentally .",
    "work on films was carried out by reichhardt and zimnyi@xcite and by the author@xcite .",
    "both investigate vortices interacting with a square cd - lattice driven along the [ 1,0 ] , or [ 0,1 ] , directions , and consider the following vortex densities : @xmath0 vortex per cd in ref . ;",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 vortices per cd in ref .. they find that the directions of vortex motion and drive coincide , and that the dynamical phase diagrams depend on the vortex density . for densities @xmath0 and @xmath1 vortices per cd",
    "the dynamical phase diagrams are similar , with three dynamical phases : a moving lattice , commensurate with the pinning potential periodicity along the direction transverse to motion , a moving smectics and a moving liquid .",
    "dynamical transitions between the commensurate lattice and the smectic and between the smectic and the liquid are found . in the commensurate lattice with @xmath0 vortex per cd tranverse",
    "pinning occurs @xcite . for @xmath2 vortices per cd",
    "the only dynamical phases are an incommensurate lattice , essentially triangular , and a liquid , and dynamical melting between them takes place @xcite .",
    "the present paper shows how these particular film results fit into a dynamical phase diagram that depends on the magnitude and direction of the driving force , and on the temperature .",
    "the approach adopted here is similar to that used in ref .. first the limit of high drives , where the dynamical phase diagrams are simpler , is studied in detail . only then the paper proceeds to investigate the intermediate and low drives behavior .",
    "the paper starts by considering langevin s stochastic dynamical equations for a generic model for vortices interacting with periodic pinning at temperature @xmath3 , and its behavior in the limit where the driving force magnitude approaches infinity .",
    "it is shown that in this limit these equations , written in the cm frame , describe vortices interacting between themselves and with a static effective pinning potential , equal to the average of the periodic pinning potential in the direction of motion . as a consequence",
    ", the dynamical phases reduce to the corresponding thermal equilibrium ones , which are hereafter referred to as infinite - drive phases .",
    "these phases are exact asymptotic limits of dynamical phases occuring in the dynamical phase diagram .",
    "the infinite - drive phases , being equilibrium phases , are distinguished from each other by the spatial order . thus , dynamical phases with distinct spatial orders , one for each infinite - drive phase are expected to exist in finite - drive regions of the dynamical phase diagrams .",
    "the question is whether or not these dynamical phases exhaust the dynamical phase diagrams .",
    "the answer is found be yes for the model studied in this paper , as well as for those investigated by marconi and dominguez@xcite and by reichhardt and zimnyi@xcite .",
    "next , the paper studies numerically the london model for vortices interacting with a square cd - lattice introduced in ref .. two vortex densities , typical of the region where there are more vortices than cd ( @xmath4 ) , are considered : @xmath2 vortices per cd ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath1 vortices per cd ( @xmath6 )",

    "however it is not possible to identify the infinite - drive phases from the data reported in the paper .",
    "some studies of vortices interacting with cd - lattices at @xmath155 @xcite find dynamical phases and phase transitions similar to the ones reported in this paper and in ref .. examples are tranverse pinning , moving commensurate and incommensurate lattices and dynamical transitions between them .",

    "the vortices relax after sufficient long times to a steady state , identified as the dynamical phase , that is unique as far as the probability distribution is concerned @xcite .",
    "accordingly , dynamical phase changes caused by varying the driving force , the temperature , or both , are reversible .",
    "this is not necessarily the case at @xmath155 .",
    "however , in numerical studies , irreversibility appears due to insufficient run times to reach the steady state , particularly when relaxation times are very large .",
    "this occurs in several circumstances , such as low temperatures , or vicinity of dynamical phase changes . in the simulations reported in this paper low temperatures",
    "are avoided .",
    "some simulation runs where performed cycling the driving force magnitude from a large value to a small one and back .",
    "small hysteresis is found near dynamical phase transitions .    in conclusion ,",
    "the approach adopted in this paper to construct the dynamical phase diagrams , starting from the infinite - drive ones , provides a simple method , based on equilibrium statistical mechanics , to identify dynamical phases spatial order , and to predict dynamical phase transitions .",
    "it is expected that this method is applicable to a large class of periodic pinning potentials and vortex densities .",
    "the reasons are that the effective pinning potentials resulting from averaging physically reasonable periodic pinning potentials in the direction of motion are , as those discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec.idph ] , essentially constant for most directions , and one - dimensional and periodic for a few particular ones .",
    "this predicts the existence , for @xmath158 , of moving lattices , commensurate or incommensurate with the effective pinning potential periodicity , moving smectics and moving liquids , similar to the ones reported here , and of dynamical phase transitions between then .",
    "for @xmath159 the moving lattices may be different , particularly at low vortex densities , where the commensurate infinite - drive phases are not expected to retain the simple chain structure found here for the @xmath158 ones . however , the close relationship between the dynamical phase diagrams and the infinite - drive ones are still valid , as evidenced by the jja results of ref .. the dynamical phases obtained by this method do not , in general , exhaust the dynamical phase diagram .",
    "one known type of dynamical phase that has no corresponding infinite - drive phase is that in which some vortices are pinned by the periodic potential and others are moving .",
    "these are found at low drives in some @xmath155 simulations for @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "no such phases are found in the present simulations nor in refs .. the details of how the dynamical phases and dynamical phase transitions predicted by the method proposed here fit into the dynamical phase diagram for each particular model and vortex density depends in a complicated way on the model parameters , and has to be determined in each case .",
