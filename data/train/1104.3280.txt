    "one of the open problem in quantum information theory is to quantify the entanglement of a multipartite quantum state .",
    "many entanglement measures for pure or mixed multipartite states have been proposed @xcite @xcite , among them are the tangle @xcite @xcite , the schmidt measure @xcite @xcite which is the logarithmic of the minimal number of product terms that comprise the state vector , the geometric measure @xcite @xcite @xcite which is defined in terms of the maximal fidelity of the state vector and the set of pure product states , the relative entropy of entanglement @xcite @xcite , and the robustness @xcite @xcite .",
    "the last three are related with each other @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite and they are equal for some of the states such as stabilizer states , symmetric basis and anti - symmetric basis states .",
    "all these entanglement measures are not operationally defined . in bipartite system , however , the entanglement cost and the distillable entanglement are operational entanglement measures . if bipartite entanglement measures satisfy some properties , it turns out that their regularizations are bounded by distillable entanglement from one side and by entanglement cost from the other side@xcite . for a pure bipartite state ,",
    "the two bounds are equal and the entanglement is simply the entropy of the reduced density matrix thus has a clear information theoretical meaning",
    ". we will investigate the possibility of extending these entropic and operational definitions of entanglement to multipartite pure states in this paper , we will propose an entanglement measurement bound ( emb ) which is an entanglement measure for pure tripartite qubit states .",
    "the bound is based on the results of local measurements .",
    "local measurement or local discrimination had been used as upper bound of certain entanglement measures . for a graph state ,",
    " pauli persistency  has been used as an upper bound of schmidt measure @xcite , a quantity based on locc measurements has been used as an upper bound @xcite of geometric measure .",
    "what is the usefulness of a bipartite entangled state ?",
    "one answer should be that we can use it for cryptography .",
    "if alice s part is measured in spin up , bob s part should definitely in spin up for a bipartite spin entangled bell state @xmath0 thus using @xmath1 pairs of bell state , we can get a shared string of @xmath1 bits for alice and bob through measurements .",
    "if alice measures her part in the basis of @xmath2 @xmath3 then the measurement results should be that alice and bob are simultaneously in state @xmath4 or they are simultaneously in state @xmath5 , each with probability @xmath6 thus if we have @xmath1 pairs of bell state , we can get a shared string of @xmath1 bits regardless of the measurement basis alice chosen . when we have a less entangled state @xmath7 what can we do for the purpose of cryptography ?",
    "certainly , we can measure one of the part , say alice in the spin up and down basis .",
    "the result turns out to be a shared string of length @xmath8 with the probability @xmath9 for spin up , and the probability @xmath10 for spin down .",
    "the information contained in such a string can be calculated to be @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the binary entropy function . however , if alice measures her part in a rather arbitrary basis @xmath4 and @xmath13 bob will get his state in @xmath14 and @xmath15 states with probabilities @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "we can get a shared string of length @xmath1 with total information content @xmath18 notice that @xmath19 the minimal information content occurs at the case of @xmath20 or @xmath21 so at least we can get a shared string with information content @xmath22 which is the entanglement of the @xmath1 pairs of the state @xmath23 hence , the entanglement of a pure bipartite entangled state is the minimal shared information content obtained by measurement .",
    "this point had been proved in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of measurement entropy . for completeness",
    ", we will give an alternative proof in the following .",
    "for a bipartite state @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the orthogonal basis , it is well known that the entanglement entropy is the entropy of the reduced density matrix when one of the partite is traced out .",
    "we have @xmath27 thus in the basis @xmath28 , the reduced state is @xmath29where @xmath30 is the matrix with entries @xmath31 a unitary transformation @xmath32 diagonalizes @xmath33 to @xmath34 thus @xmath35 so that the singular value decomposition of matrix @xmath30 is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is some other unitary transformation .",
    "we have the schmidt decomposition @xmath38 with orthogonal basis@xmath39 @xmath40 the entanglement of the state is @xmath41 now , we use the measurement to obtain shared digital information from the state vector @xmath42 suppose the state vector is projected to alice s measurement base vector @xmath43 then bob s state will be proportional to @xmath44 the probability of which is @xmath45 let s consider which measurement basis yields the optimal probability @xmath46 this is an optimal of @xmath47 with respect to @xmath48 subjected to @xmath49 with the lagrange multiplier @xmath50 , we can write the optimal equation as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 the optimal equation then reads @xmath53 or @xmath54 where @xmath55 the optimal probability should be @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 so the optimal probability is the eigenvalue of the reduced density matrix @xmath59 hence if we use eigenvectors of @xmath60 as the measurement basis , the average information of each shared digit is the entanglement of the state . denote the eigensystem of @xmath60 as @xmath61 let s see if the unitary transformed basis @xmath62 decrease the entropy @xmath63 or not , where @xmath64 denote the elements of @xmath32 in the basis of @xmath65 , we have @xmath66 . using the spectrum decomposition of @xmath67",
    "then @xmath68 notice that function @xmath69 is concave , that is , for @xmath70,$ ] one has @xmath71 then @xmath72 where the unitarity of @xmath32 is used . hence @xmath73 we get the desired result .      for",
    "an @xmath74partite state @xmath75 let @xmath76 be the probability vector with multiple subscripts , the components of @xmath77 are @xmath78 @xmath79 here @xmath80 ( denoted simply as @xmath81 hereafter ) @xmath82 are the orthonormal basis of @xmath83 partite when the measurement results for the former parties are @xmath84 respectively .",
    "the emb of @xmath85 is defined as the minimal entropy of the measurement probability vector , that is , @xmath86 the minimization is over all possible local orthogonal measurements .",
    "notice that the local measurements can be carried out step by step , for each result of the first partite measurement , one can choose an orthogonal basis to measure the second partite residue state .",
    "so one may have @xmath87 different projection measurements for the second partite .",
    "when measuring the third partite , one can have @xmath88 projection measurements , and so on .",
    "the choice of @xmath83 partite basis can rely on all the former measurement results .",
    "the total number of measurements is @xmath89 meanwhile , the minimization in ( [ wav4 ] ) is also with respect to all permutation of the parties .",
    "there is an definition of entanglement measure based on measurement@xcite . in the definition of @xcite ,",
    "each partite has only one kind of ( complete ) measurement , the total number of the measurements is @xmath90 the @xmath91 in @xcite is no less than our entanglement measurement bound @xmath92 by definition .",
    "in the multipartite case it is useful to compare emb according to different partitions , where the components @xmath93 are grouped into disjoint sets .",
    "any sequence @xmath94 of disjoint subsets @xmath95 with @xmath96 will be called a partition of @xmath37 .",
    "we will write @xmath97 if @xmath98 is a finer partition than @xmath99 .",
    "emb is non - increasing under a coarser grain of the partition .",
    "if two components are merged to form a new component , then emb can only decrease .",
    "this is because that the minimization in the definition of emb eq .",
    "( [ wav4 ] ) can also be seen as with respect to all possible local measurement hierarchies .",
    "a local measurement hierarchy of a finer partition @xmath98 is definitely a local measurement hierarchy of the coarser grain partition @xmath100 while the inverse may not be true .",
    "so from @xmath98 to @xmath100 the set of local measurement hierarchies is enlarged , the minimization may reach further lower value .",
    "we have @xmath101 where we specify the partition as the superscript of emb .",
    "so any coarser partition is a lower bound of the finer partition for emb . especially , lower bound of emb for a tripartite pure state is the bipartite pure state entanglement , which is easily obtained .",
    "there are three bipartitions of a tripartite state , the tighter lower bound is the partition with largest entanglement .",
    "suppose @xmath92 is achieved by the probability vector @xmath76 with components @xmath102 for all @xmath103 we may denote the largest one as @xmath104 so @xmath105 .",
    "then @xmath106 @xmath107 the last inequality comes from the fact that the geometric measure @xmath108 where @xmath109 the minimization is over all possible product state @xmath110 the largest fidelity @xmath111 should be no less than some special fidelity @xmath112      suppose the orthogonal expansion of @xmath113 with @xmath114 @xmath115 be the optimal expansion that achieves the measure entanglement , that is @xmath116 with @xmath117 let s construct the separable state @xmath118 the relative entropy of @xmath119 with respect to @xmath120 is @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath124 @xmath125 it is larger than or equal to the relative entropy of entanglement @xmath126 since the separable state @xmath127 is just one of the full separable states , it may not be the full separable state that achieves the minimal relative entropy for state @xmath128 so we have @xmath129    more concretely , we will consider the pure tripartite qubit state in the next section .",
    "it is well known that ghz state and w state are two different kinds of pure tripartite states that are not convertible with each other under stochastic local operation and classical communication ( slocc ) .",
    "we may write the states in computational basis as @xmath130 and @xmath131 the three parties are called alice , bob and charlie .",
    "when they share ghz state , if alice measures her part with result @xmath132 then the states of bob and charlie are in @xmath133 without further measurement . when alice measures @xmath134 the other two parts are also in @xmath135 a common string of bits among the three parts can be established when one of them measures in computational basis .",
    "however , when alice measures in @xmath136 @xmath137 basis , the joint state of bob and charlie will be left to the entangled state @xmath138 or @xmath139 .",
    "further measurement should be performed to determine the state of bob as well as charlie .",
    "so ghz state measured in computational basis is a rather special case when only one step of measurement is required to transform the tripartite entanglement to shared bits . in general",
    ", we need two steps of measurements to convert the tripartite quantum correlation to classical correlation .    in computational basis",
