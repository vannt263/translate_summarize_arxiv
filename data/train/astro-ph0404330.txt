    "diffuse interstellar bands ( see e.g. herbig 1995 ) , absorption structures of interstellar origin still await explanation .",
    "the identification of the carrier(s ) of dibs is one of the most difficult challenges for spectroscopists .    to the present day",
    ", huge amounts of observational data on dibs have been stored by astronomers and published in hundreds of papers .",
    "unfortunately , astronomical data still do not meet sufficient understanding from the point of view of laboratory spectroscopists .",
    "one tries , in general , to solve the mystery of the carrier(s ) of dibs on the field of interdisciplinary spectroscopic collaboration between molecular physicists , molecular chemists and astronomers .",
    "one expects that some progress on this field will be possible when all known dibs ( about three hundred of them have been discovered in visible light region ) are divided into families in such a way that only one carrier is responsible for all bands belonging to a given family .",
    "such families of bands we call spectroscopic ones , to distinguish them from characterological families isolated by the other authors ( chlewicki et.al .",
    "1986 , kreowski & walker 1987 , josafatson & snow 1987 ) .",
    "all bands belonging to the spectroscopic family are , by definition , caused by the same carrier .",
    "bands belonging to the characterological family have some common characteristics ( e.g. all are rather narrow ) , but they may be produced by different carriers .    to isolate spectroscopic families of bands , first of all one has to by - pass in some way the problem of the `` noisy correlation '' . in a given spectrogram we have to deal with a complicated mixture of interstellar absorption structures .",
    "this is because the medium between the target star and the observer contains various species . for different directions ( various target stars ) we have to deal with different column densities of interstellar matter giving contributions to the spectra .",
    "intensities of all spectral lines ( bands ) measured in a spectrogram are well correlated with the column density of relevant matter and therefore also lines originated by different species are mutually correlated .",
    "such correlation we call `` noisy correlation '' . of course",
    "not only differences in column densities of relevant interstellar matter may produce noisy correlation between dibs . other contribution to correlation of this kind",
    "may be given , for example , by mutually dependent astrochemical processes .",
    "noisy correlation tells us nothing about spectroscopic families of bands .",
    "the number of recognized dibs has grown dramatically in recent years , primarily due to better quality of observational material .",
    "more and more weak dibs ( wdibs ) seem to appear every time a given spectral region is analysed carefully .",
    "one of the authors of this paper ( bw ) spent a few years analysing spectra for new , very weak dibs .",
    "it turned out to be of great importance to reexamine the problem of dib families .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore further the properties of dibs in the context of isolating families of the structures .",
    "we first describe observational material which revealed the above mentioned absorption bands .",
    "then we present the results of the measuring procedure and describe dib searching methods . in the last section of the paper we discuss the problem of some adequate method for separating spectroscopic families of dibs , and we pick out two probable `` relatives '' for 5780 band and four other ones for 5797 band .",
    "all the spectra analysed for the purpose of this paper were taken from the archives of prof .",
    "jacek kreowski ( astronomical center , nicolaus copernicus university , toru , poland ) .",
    "we used spectra taken with the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) ( described by snow and seab ( 1991 ) ) covering the spectral range 5780 - 5905  and spectra acquired at the mcdonald observatory with an echelle spectrograph fed with the 2.1 m telescope , covering the spectral range from 5600 to 7000  ( kreowski and sneden , 1993 ) .",
    "spectra acquired with the cfht have s / n of about 800 and resolution r of about 60000 .",
    "the relatively high quality of the observational data used allowed us to measure the equivalent widths for many strong and weak dibs .",
    "firstly , from the mcdonald observatory data , spectrograms of the highest possible quality were selected for 25 targets . using the chosen spectra , we measured equivalent widths ( ew ) end depths of 18 prominent dibs within the spectral range from 5760 to 6700  .",
    "hd numbers of stars and designations of considered dibs , as well as values of measured parameters are given in table 1 .",
    "in each cell of the table ( provided it is not empty ) we have ( from top to bottom ) : ew ( in milliangstroms ) , error of the measurement of the ew , and line depth ( in promilles of continuum ) .",
    "in the cases of problematic measurements , due to unsatisfactory quality of spectra , the cell in the table was left empty .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , > , > \" , ]     the result in point ( i ) clearly shows that some of the wdibs are linearly well correlated with different dibs ( 5780 , 5797 ) which definitively do not belong to the same spectroscopic family .",
    "therefore , the statistical approach to our data is not sufficiently strong by itself to discriminate the membership of wdibs into families .",
    "more detailed analysis , taking into account other methods , is therefore required .      to check mutual dependence between wdibs and 5780 and 5797 bands , we have started from the following procedure . from table 3",
    "we extracted a sample with ew(5797 ) restricted to a very narrow range of values .",
    "from such a sample we separated two subsamples : the first one with relatively low , and the second one with relatively high values of ew(5780 ) . in these subsamples we calculated mean values of ew(5780 ) , ew(5797 ) and ews for wdibs .",
    "both subsamples , as well as results of averaging , are displayed in table 6 .",
    "wdibs correlated with 5780 should follow changes in ew(5780 ) , contrary to those which are not correlated .",
    "9.5 cm    in a quite similar way we have extracted a sample of stars with almost constant ew(5780 ) and separated subsamples with opposite values of ew(5797 ) - table 7 .",
    "such a simple procedure allowed us to divide wdibs into three groups ; ( i ) well correlated with 5780 ( 5776 , 5795 ) , ( ii ) well correlated with 5797 ( 5793 , 5819 , 5829 ) and ( iii ) correlated with neither 5780 nor 5797 ( 5769 , 5773 , 5809 ) .",
    "three other cases ( 5760 , 5763 , 5766 ) are rather complicated because they seem to be correlated with 5797 as well as with 5780 .",
    "the main selection criterion here was a gradient of the average value for wdibs .",
    "if this gradient , for a considered wdib , is evidently similar to the gradient which is typical for the leading band ( in our case this gradient is very close to 0.5 ) we included this wdib into the family .",
    "please note that the term `` correlation '' used above does not mean the same as correlation in the statistical sense .",
    "statistically , all considered bands are quite well mutually correlated .",
    "another way to divide wdibs into the three above mentioned groups consists in visual inspection of spectrograms .",
    "if we compose sequences of spectrograms in such a way that ew(5780 ) , for example , is constant and ew(5797 ) gradually increases ( fig.2 ) we are able , after visual inspection of the picture , to indicate wdibs which follow , and those ones which do not follow , the behaviour of 5797 .",
    "figure 3 shows the case of nearly constant ew(5797 ) and changing ew(5780 ) .",
    "this inspection procedure of figures 2 and 3 confirms results achieved with the earlier described averaging procedure .",
    "furthermore , one can , when studying figures 2 and 3 , make the following conclusions :    - the 5850 band , which corresponds to relatively strong phenomena , is very well correlated with the 5797 band and not ( at all ) with the 5780 one ( this was claimed already by kreowski _ et al . _ , 1993 ) ,    - the 5763 band follows the behaviour of the band 5797 and does not follow ( at all ) the 5780 band ,    - although figures 2 and 3 are not as good as required for studying the 5760 band it seems that this wdib is correlated rather with 5797 than with the 5780 band ,    - the 5769 band also seems to be well correlated with the 5797 band .",
    "it is worthly of note that the observations we are dealing with here were not planned for searching for spectroscopic families .",
    "one may , however , perform much more adequate observations , directed to the subject . in the case of better data",
    ", similar analysis would give much more reliable results and lead directly to separation of true spectroscopic families of bands .",
    "as mentioned in the introductory section , the main obstacle to isolating spectroscopic families of dibs is the noisy correlation . due to a very high level ( as the analysed data reveals ) of noisy correlation in the considered data ,",
    "the ability of statistical method to isolate spectroscopic families are very limited .",
    "tight linear correlation , expected between members of the same spectroscopic family , is efectively hidden by noisy correlation and by measuring errors .",
    "this is evident when we study results of statistical analysis described in the previous section .",
    "looking at table 5 only , we are not able to indicate which wdib belongs to the same spectroscopic family as , for example , the band 5797 . on the other hand ,",
    "when considering table 4 , we would be inclined to isolate , e.g , the family of strong lines : 6196 , 6203 , 6270 , 6426 , 6614 , 6699 , 5780 , 5797 ; and this would be a mistake , since 5780 and 5797 belong to different families , as mentioned in section 5 .",
    "taking into account that statistical analysis requires plenty of usable data and gives insufficient ( for solving our problem by itself ) results , it is therefore not recommended as an appropriate tool for isolating spectroscopic families .",
    "[ however , the statistical approach may be useful to distinguish linearly correlated bands from these ones which are correlated non - linearly .",
    "non - linearly correlated dibs should belong to different spectroscopic families .",
    "also multidimensional statistical analysis could be useful in this case .",
    "further study of this problem will be the subject of a separate paper ( godowski & wszoek , in preparation ) ] .",
    "methods described in subsections 6.2 and 6.3 are much more appropriate than the formal statistical aproach .",
    "they need a fewer number of spectrograms and much less time for making ew ( or depth ) measurements .",
    "these methods seem also to give valuable results . using these methods we performed preliminary separation of two presumable spectroscopic families : ( i ) 5780 , 5776 and 5795 , and ( ii ) 5793 , 5797 , 5819 , 5829 and 5850 .",
    "most probably , designated families are not complete yet .",
    "one can not exclude also the possibility that we made wrong indications . in the case of almost constant ratios between column densities of various dib carriers in interstellar clouds",
    ", we have a chance to get results quite similar those of the case when we have to deal with few spectral lines of the same carrier .",
    "further investigation , based on better data samples and involving other spectral ranges , is necessary to isolate true spectroscopic families of bands .",
