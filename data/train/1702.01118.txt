    "measuring the value of the hubble constant ( @xmath11 ) is a fundamental step in extragalactic astronomy and cosmology .",
    "tremendous work has been conducted over the past few decades to accurately determine the value of the hubble constant .",
    "however , the estimated values have been controversial until recently . in the 20th century , two groups led by allan sandage and gerard de vaucouleurs , respectively , measured the value of the hubble constant to be between @xmath11= 50 and 100 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8@xcite .",
    "this was known as `` the factor of two controversy '' .",
    "although it is not clear that this large discrepancy of @xmath11 originated from a purely scientific result or from a publication bias , the value of @xmath11 has settled down to a value between the two , @xmath12 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 , with the advent of the @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 ( hst ) .",
    "the hubble key project played a key role in the calibration of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "they improved the luminosity calibration of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) with the hst and yielded a value of @xmath11 = @xmath13 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 .",
    "a few years later , however , the sn hst project presented a somewhat lower value , @xmath14 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8   @xcite from nearly the same hst imaging data as used in the hubble key project .",
    "the level of difference is @xmath15 .",
    "recent estimations by the supernovae and h0 for the equation of state ( sh0es ) and the carnegie hubble program provided more precise values : @xmath16 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8   @xcite , @xmath17 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8   @xcite , and @xmath18 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8  @xcite , respectively .",
