    "a significant increase in the @xmath0c to @xmath6c isotope ratio was detected in japanese trees in ad 774/5 and a subsequent decrease for @xmath7 yr ( * ? ? ?",

    "it is consistent with an increase in @xmath0c in american and european trees with @xmath8 to @xmath9 yr time resolution @xcite . if deposited within one year or less - best consistent with an atmospheric deposition model - the increase is 10 times larger than the average production due to galactic cosmic rays and 20 times larger than expected from the @xmath10 yr solar cycle ( m12 ) .",
    "this requires a @xmath1-ray energy input of @xmath2 erg at earth ( m12 ) .",
    "also , a @xmath11 increase in @xmath3be around ad 775 was observed in antarctica , but with lower time resolution @xcite .",
    "solar or stellar flare were found to be unlikely because of the insufficient energetics and spectrum of such flares ( m12 ) . a normal supernova ( sn )",
    "was also found to be unlikely from the lack of any historical sighting or a sn remnant ( snr ) ( m12 ) .",
    "a strongly absorbed sn was not considered quantitatively , yet : absorption in the line - of - sight would not affect @xmath1-rays , but would decrease the observable optical flux of a sn . of the total energy output of a sn , e(event ) = @xmath12 erg , a fraction @xmath13 goes into @xmath1-rays @xcite .",
    "the ratio between the @xmath1-ray energy emitted by a sn event spread homogeneously into the total area of a spherical shell around the sn ( @xmath14 with distance @xmath15 from the event to earth ) and the @xmath1-ray energy e(obs ) observed at earth is equal to the ratio between the surface area of that sphere and the earth solid angle @xmath16 ( with earth radius @xmath17 ) :    @xmath18    therefore , a normal sn ( with @xmath13 ) , of which a @xmath1-ray flux of e(obs ) = @xmath2 erg was observed at earth , would have a distance @xmath19 pc , independent of absorption .",
    "if the ad 774/5 event were one of the rare ( @xmath20 ) over - luminous sne , up to four times brighter than normal sne @xcite , then the expected distance is @xmath21 pc . from the peak absolute magnitude @xmath22 @xcite",

    "+ one would need absorption of at least @xmath29 mag to disable a historical sighting by naked eye ( limit @xmath30 mag for discovery of a new object , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such a strong absorption within @xmath31 or @xmath32 pc is not possible , except in small areas towards dark clouds @xcite : the closest dark clouds with @xmath33 mag are lynds 183 at @xmath34 pc with up to a@xmath35 mag @xcite and @xmath36 oph at @xmath37 pc with up to a@xmath38 mag @xcite .",
    "absorption of @xmath33 mag is limited to @xmath39 deg@xmath40 on the sky ( * ? ? ? * and k. dobashi priv .",

    "the probability of an event within @xmath39 deg@xmath40 of the whole sky is @xmath42 .",

    ". given the measurement precision achieved in @xmath0c for the @xmath43 peak in ad 774/5 ( m12 ) , potential @xmath0c from sne can be detected up to @xmath44 pc with @xmath45 .",
    "indeed , there are no sne , pulsars , nor snr known within a few hundred pc with age of some 300 to 2000 yr ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* footnote 1 ; mcgill sgr / axp catalog ) there are eleven events with evidence ( historic observation , detected snr and/or known pulsar ) for a sn within 2000 yr and 5 kpc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* footnote 1 & 2 ) and for all of them , a snr is detected @xcite , and at least eight were observed historically @xcite . while a missing historic observation is possible , a missing snr is very unlikely .",
    "magnetar flares ( soft gamma - ray repeaters or anomalous x - ray pulsars ) were not yet considered : the largest flare observed was the x- and @xmath1-ray flare of sgr 1806 - 20 on 2004 dec 27 with peak energy ( @xmath46 erg / s at 15 kpc @xcite , or e(event ) = @xmath47 erg at @xmath48 kpc @xcite .",
    "if the ad 774/5 event were such a flare , it would have taken place at @xmath49 pc ( equ . 1 with @xmath50 ) , but there is no neutron star known within such a small distance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* footnote 2 ) even if a magnetar with @xmath51 g dipole field could produce an event with @xmath52 erg @xcite , the distance of such a neutron star to produce the ad 774/5 event would have to be @xmath53 pc .",
    "a magnetar at that small distance would have been detected by the rosat all - sky x - ray survey : for a persistent bolometric luminosity ( mostly x - rays ) of @xmath54 erg / s with typical observed spectral components of magnetars ( blackbody with peak energy @xmath55 kev and power - law index @xmath56 , footnote 2 ) , we expect 150 to 800000 cts / s in the rosat energy band 0.1 - 2.4 kev at 10 to even 100 pc , i.e. easily detectable .",
    "hence , we can exclude magnetar flares for the ad 774/5 event .",
    "given that events on earth as well as solar and stellar flares ( m12 ) including neutron star flares ( see above ) as well as unabsorbed ( m12 ) and absorbed supernovae are very unlikely to be the cause for the ad 774/5 cosmic - ray event ( see above ) , we will now consider a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) .",
    "the observed duration and spectral hardness of grbs allows to divide them into long ( @xmath57s ) and short ( @xmath58s ) grbs , the latter are harder regarding the spectrum ( power - law with exponential cutoff ) and are not related to sne nor snrs @xcite . while long grbs are caused by the core collapse of a very massive star , short grbs are explained by the merger of two compact objects @xcite .",
    "a merger of two previously orbiting compact objects is the coalescence of a neutron star with either a black hole becoming a more massive black hole , or with another neutron star becoming either a relatively massive stable neutron star or otherwise a black hole , if the total mass exceeds the upper mass limit of neutron stars , somewhere between 2 and 3 m@xmath59 .",
    "e.g. , the merger of two magnetized neutron stars can produce a spinning black hole launching a relativistic jet as observed in short grbs @xcite , if the earth is located in the jet .",
    "let us now consider a short grb .",
    "a short grb emits an isotropic equivalent energy of e(event ) = @xmath60 to @xmath61 erg in the observed energy range 10 kev to 30 gev @xcite , most or all in @xmath1-rays ( @xmath62 to 1 ) .",
    "we estimate the distance towards a short grb from equ . 1 to @xmath63 to @xmath64 kpc , i.e. within our galaxy .",
    "hence , the energetics of the @xmath0c peak on earth are consistent with a short grb .",
    "effects of nearby long grbs on the earth biosphere due to the direct hit ( @xmath65 erg / s for 10s ) on one half - sphere were found to be lethal within @xmath66 kpc @xcite .",
    "this can be scaled to a short grb with @xmath60 to @xmath61 erg .",
    "hence , for a short grb within @xmath4 kpc , strong extinction effects are expected . because no extinction event was observed on earth for ad 774/5 , the short grb was more distant , probably @xmath4 to @xmath5 kpc .",
    "a transient event is expected in the optical ( macronova ) from compact mergers with @xmath67 mag at peak @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath68 ( 0.1 kpc ) or @xmath69 mag ( 4 kpc ) for negligible absorption .",
    "hence , it may have been observable by naked eye , but only for up to one day , i.e. much shorter than a typical sn .",
    "if reports about such a sighting remain missing , it can be due to the short time - scale , strong absorption , bad weather , and/or sky location near the sun and/or above unpopulated areas such as the pacific during the short visibility period .",
    "a missing historical observation and a missing snr are fully consistent with a short grb .",
    "since the peak of @xmath0c observed in ad 774/5 is consistent with a sharp increase within 0.1 to 1 yr ( m12 ) , a short grb typically lasting less than 2s @xcite and being undispersed in interstellar space is consistent with the observations regarding the short time - scale .",
    "c and @xmath3be .",
    "we plot the energy dependence of the cross - sections @xmath70 of the reactions @xmath0n(n , p)@xmath0c and @xmath0n(n , p+@xmath71)@xmath3be as full and dotted lines , respectively , cross - section in milli - barn ( mb , 1 barn is @xmath72 m@xmath40 ) versus energy in mev.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]     ( with frequency @xmath73 ) versus energy in mev sampling the whole range of parameters observed , i.e. several typical spectra as blue and red lines for short and long grbs , respectively .",
    "we plot the flux as log of @xmath74 in mev@xmath75 photons @xmath76 @xmath77 s@xmath78 mev@xmath79 ( plus arbitrary scaling due to normalization ) . at the observable low @xmath1-ray energies",
    ", we see that short grbs are harder than long grbs , hence the devision and naming .",
    "we use equ . 2 & 3 and the band function @xcite to estimate the production rate of @xmath0c to @xmath3be from the input spectra for short and long grbs .",
    "because long grbs have a flat spectrum ( band function ) , they can not reproduce the observed production rate of @xmath0c to @xmath3be ( @xmath80 ) , while short grbs can reproduce the observed ratio , see fig .",
    "[ fg3].,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    given the cross - sections of the relevant reactions producing @xmath0c and @xmath3be ( fig .",
    "[ fg1 ] ) and the full range of observed spectral parameters of short @xcite and long ( band function , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) grbs ( fig .",
    "[ fg2 ] ) , we computed the outcome ( fig .  [ fg3 ] ) .",
    "we assume that the peaks in @xmath0c ( @xmath81 atoms / cm@xmath40/s in @xmath83 yr , m12 ) , and @xmath3be ( @xmath84 increase with 10 yr time resolution , * ? ? ? * ) were both due to the same event , i.e. produced within one year .",
    "then , with the known background rates for @xmath0c ( m12 ) and for @xmath3be @xcite , we conclude that @xmath85 ( 1@xmath70 error ) times more @xmath0c was produced than @xmath3be , above the respective backgrounds .",
    "since some of the @xmath3be production may have been produced by some other effects in that decade ( lower time resolution ) , this ratio can be considered as a lower limit .",
    "we can compare this to the expected outcome for a short grb : the typical energy spectrum of a short grb is @xmath86 with a power - law index @xmath71 and a cutoff energy e@xmath87 @xcite .",
    "we obtained the cross - sections @xmath70 for the reactions @xmath0n(n , p)@xmath0c and @xmath0n(n , p+@xmath71)@xmath3be from e = 10 to 60 mev ( footnote 3 ) .",
    "we show the dependence of the cross - sections @xmath70 on the energy e for both reactions in fig .",
    "then , we integrated the cross - section @xmath70 at that energy range e multiplied by the typical short grb spectra sp(e ) over the energy e from 10 to 60 mev for both @xmath0c and @xmath3be to obtain the expected ratio : @xmath88 given the definition of cross - section , both the nominator and the denominator in this equation are proportional to the respective number of atoms produced .",
    "we estimated the ratio as expected differential production rates for a grid of @xmath71 and e@xmath87 as observed for short grbs , i.e. power law index @xmath71 from @xmath89 to 1.4 and cutoff energy e@xmath87 from 49 to 1900 kev @xcite , using xspec .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "we then also estimated the expected fraction of @xmath0c to @xmath3be production over the backgrounds for a long grb with a band function as spectrum @xcite , i.e. a smoothly broken power - law .",
    "again , we used the full range of parameters observed for all those long grbs , where all three spectral parameters were obtained by good fits , namely for the 1st index @xmath71 from @xmath90 to 0.07 , for the 2nd index @xmath91 from @xmath92 to @xmath93 , and for the cutoff energy e@xmath87 from 52 to 2867 kev ( not redshifted ) for long grbs observed by fermi or batse @xcite .",
    "[ fg2 ] already shows qualitatively that a long grb with a model of a smoothly broken power law ( band function ) can not explain that the @xmath0c production was so much larger than the @xmath3be production given the energy - dependence of the cross - sections of those reactions .",
    "our detailed calculations show that a long grb with the band function would produce only up to 18 times more @xmath0c than @xmath3be .",
    "only a short grb can explain this observable ( ratio @xmath80 ) .",
    "the rate of @xmath0c peaks ( 1 in 3000 yr ) is not well constrained , but non - zero ; the error of the rate is fully unconstrained .",
    "the rate of short grbs is @xmath94 gpc@xmath95 yr@xmath79 @xcite , all observed and pointed at us . using then @xmath96 mpc@xmath95 as number density of typical galaxies",
    "@xcite , we have one short galactic grb in @xmath97 kyr beamed towards earth .",
    "if we restrict this estimate to the galactic disk within 4 kpc , the observed rate is 10 times lower , i.e. one nearby galactic grb beamed at us in @xmath98 kyr . given the sensitivity limits of detectors like batse and swift , this is a highly uncertain lower limit .",
    "while this is not consistent with 1 event in 3000 yr within @xmath99 , it is consistent within @xmath100 .",
    "given that the error of the @xmath0c event rate is unknown , it is consistent with the rate of local short grbs even within @xmath101 .    even though the possible connection between short grbs and compact mergers are not of central importance for our arguments , because we use only real observables of short grbs",
    ", we will now consider the rates of mergers of compact objects .",
    "from the three known double neutron stars , one can expect the rate of mergers per galaxy to be 3 to 190 myr@xmath79 ( @xmath99 error range ) with the mean being 13 myr@xmath79 @xcite . from the initial mass function and ,",
    "hence , birth rate of massive stars that can become neutron stars , then taking into account the multiplicity rate , evolution , and interaction of massive stars , one can predict 0.3 to 50 mergers per galaxy myr@xmath79 ( @xmath99 error range ) with the mean being 15 myr@xmath79 @xcite . thus , at most we expect 190 mergers per galaxy myr@xmath79 or up to one merger in @xmath102 yr . if such a merger would be observable as short grb , one would have to correct the rate for the beaming fraction @xmath103 to 0.13 for short grbs @xcite .",
    "for @xmath104 , one would then expect up to one merger in @xmath105 yr ( within @xmath99 error bars ) , pointed towards earth as short grb ( ten times less within 4 kpc ) .    because of sensitivity limits of observational techniques , both the observed multiplicity rate of massive stars and the estimated number of double neutron stars and mergers are lower limits .",
    "we can add the rates of mergers between neutron stars and black holes and between two black holes .",
    "neither the highly uncertain rates of observed short grbs nor of neutron star mergers are consistent with the observed rate of the @xmath0c event ( one event in 3000 yr ) within @xmath99 , but all are consistent within @xmath101 .",
    "furthermore , a short grb is the only known phenomenon that can provide correct energetics , correct spectrum , and correct time - scale for the observed event ; it also does not produce a typical sn light curve for several month nor a detectable snr nor a mass extinction event on earth , which are all missing .",
    "if the ad 774/5 event was a short grb and if the probability to observe one galactic grb within 3000 yr is too small , one would have to conclude that there are more ( fainter ) short grbs than observed so far , and/or that there is another astrophysical population contributing to short grbs , which was not yet fully recognized .",
    "short grbs with extended emission may partly be due to either an accretion - induced collapse of a white dwarf or the merger of two white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "in such an event , a magnetar can form @xcite .",
    "the rate of mergers of two white dwarfs with a total mass above the chandrasekhar mass limit of @xmath106 m@xmath59 has been estimated to be @xmath107 per m@xmath59 with @xmath108 error bars @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to only about one tenth of the sn ia rate , so that the merger of two white dwarfs with super - chandrasekhar mass can not explain all sn ia events .",
    "however , it is suggested that such super - chandrasekhar mergers can be observed as short grbs @xcite . for our galaxy with @xmath109",
    "m@xmath59 , we obtain a rate of @xmath110 mergers of white dwarf binaries with super - chandrasekhar mass in 3000 yr .",
    "if we assume that such an event can be observed as short grb with extended emission with a beaming factor of up to @xmath111 @xcite , and if we also restrict the rate to the disk within 4 kpc ( the maximum distance of a short grb to explain the ad 774/5 event ) , we expect @xmath112 such mergers in 3000 yr .",
    "since the error of the rate of @xmath0c events ( as in ad 774/5 ) is unconstrained , one can not claim that the rates of white dwarf binary mergers with super - chandrasekhar mass ( pointing towards us a short grb ) and the @xmath0c event rate are inconsistent .    since short grbs with extended emission may have lower total energies @xcite , which can be below the batse and swift sensitivity limits , they may often remain undetected , so that their observable rates could be underestimated .",
    "there is evidence for short grbs with lower energies and their rate is probably much higher @xcite .",
    "given the discussion of the rates , we can speculate that some short grbs , like possibly one in ad 774/5 , are due to an accretion - induced collapse of a white dwarf or the merger of two white dwarfs , and that such ( possibly frequent ) short grbs typically have energies below the current sensitivity limit of @xmath60 erg and possibly wide beaming angles ; they may produce a neutron star , but no snr .",
    "a long grb can be accompanied by a sn and a snr , but none were observed for ad 774/5 ; this could be due to strong absorption ( no optical sighting of the sn ) and large distance ( faint snr with very small angular extension on sky ) . with the typical isotropic equivalent energy output e(event )",

    ", one would need an absorption of @xmath116 mag for a peak absolute magnitude of @xmath117 mag for a collapsar / hypernova @xcite .",
    "an area of @xmath118 deg@xmath40 has an absorption of @xmath119 mag @xcite , an even smaller area for clouds within 1 kpc .",
    "there is no such snr detected behind these areas ( * ? ? ?",
    "* footnote 1 ) . considering also that long grbs are",
    "20 times less frequent than short grbs @xcite , a long grb behind such strong absorption is then @xmath120 times less likely than a short grb to explain the @xmath0c peak in ad 774/5 .",
    "also , sampling the whole observed range of spectral parameters of long grbs with their smoothly broken power law or band function @xcite , we can not explain the differential @xmath0c to @xmath3be production observed ( fig .",
    "[ fg1 ] ) .",
    "hence , a short grb remains the only plausible explanation for the @xmath0c peak in ad 774/5 .",
    "we list in table 1 all known neutron stars with characteristic age @xmath121 yr ( * ? ? ?",
    "* footnote 2 ) at distances from 1 to 4 kpc , but without any known snr ( green 2009 ; footnote 1 ) .",
    "the list includes two anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , one fermi gamma - ray large area telescope pulsar ( fgl ) , and one soft gamma - ray repeater ( sgr ) .",
    "we use a larger pulsar age upper limit ( 25000 yr ) than the time since ad 774/5 , because characteristic ages are usually upper limits and can be 20 times larger than the true age @xcite .",
    "we include sgr 0418 + 5729 with an upper limit for the period derivative and , hence , a lower limit on the age ( which is below 25000 yr ) . if a neutron star was formed in ad 774/5 , it is also possible that it was not yet discovered , e.g. because of misdirected pulsar beaming , or that distance and/or age have not yet been determined .",
    "for the five pulsars listed here , one should obtain deep x - ray , @xmath1-ray , h@xmath71 , and radio observations to search for snrs : if a snr can be excluded in one of them , that pulsar may be a good candidate for the product of the ad 774/5 event .",

    "the only assumptions made were the following : from comparing their @xmath0c tree ring data with a model of incorporation of @xmath0c into the biosphere , m12 concluded that the event duration was one year or shorter , and they could then derive the @xmath0c flux and energy deposited on earth which was also used in our work ; we also used the @xmath3be flux observed in the same decade @xcite and assumed that it was produced by the same event ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to derive the differential @xmath0c to @xmath3be production rate ; we derived a lower limit to the differential production rate , because some of the @xmath3be observed in that decade could have been produced by other effects .",

    "<S> in the last 3000 yr , one significant and rapid increase in the concentration of @xmath0c in tree rings was observed ; it corresponds to a @xmath1-ray energy input of @xmath2 erg at earth within up to one year in ad 774/5 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a normal supernova and a solar or stellar flare are unlikely as cause @xcite , so that the source remained unknown . here </S>",
    "<S> , we show that a short gamma - ray burst ( grb ) in our galaxy is consistent with all observables : such an event is sufficiently short and provides the necessary energy in the relevant spectral range of @xmath1-rays . </S>",
    "<S> its spectral hardness is consistent with the differential production rates of @xmath0c and @xmath3be as observed . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of reports about a historic sighting of a supernova in ad 774/5 or a present - day supernova remnant are also consistent with a short grb . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the distance towards this short grb to be @xmath4 to @xmath5 kpc - sufficiently far away , so that no extinction event on earth was triggered . </S>",
