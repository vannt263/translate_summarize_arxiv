    "first , evidence is accumulating from several processes in hadro- @xcite , photo- @xcite , lepto- , and @xmath4-production of bottom @xcite , that experimental cross - sections are uniformly larger than existing calculations , by roughly a factor of 2 .",
    "this is in contrast to charm production where no such gross discrepancy is seen .",
    "secondly , the global qcd analysis of the very accurately measured deep inelastic scattering structure functions now definitely demands a quantitative treatment of charm production which incorporates heavy quark mass effects in a reliable way .",
    "we first briefly review the various approaches to heavy quark production @xcite , and describe their synthesis in the general framework of collins @xcite .",
    "this provides a context to distinguish between issues relating to the choice of factorization scheme and those relating to implementation prescriptions allowed within a given scheme .",
    "the choice of prescriptions , such as that associated with mass threshold behavior , can matter in physical applications . in principle",
    ", the possible choices may be equivalent within the pqcd formalism ; but in practice , some are natural and robust , while others appear to be more ad hoc and volatile .",
    "we examine this practical problem , and point out a so far overlooked kinematic constraint which greatly simplifies the calculation of subprocesses with heavy quark initial states .",
    "this leads to a efficient formalism which also yields very robust predictions .",
    "it can be used to address the current challenges described in the previous paragraph .",
    "to see the basic physics ideas , let us focus explicitly on the production of charm ( @xmath5 ) in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "all considerations apply to a generic heavy quark , and to hadro - production processes .",

    "the mass parameter @xmath8 is explicitly kept along with @xmath3 as if they are of the same order , _ irrespective of their real relative magnitudes_. this is usually referred to as the fixed flavor - number ( ffn ) scheme .",

    "however , as @xmath3 becomes large compared to @xmath8 , the ffn approach becomes unreliable since the perturbative expansion contains terms of the form @xmath14 at any order @xmath15 , which ruin the convergence of the series .",

    "we note that this composite scheme is just an extension of the conventional ( zero - mass ) variable flavor number scheme ( vfns ) , to include heavy quark mass effects in a rigorous way",
    ". we will simply refer to it as the vfns in the following discussions .",
    "with the use of the general formalism , the theory of inclusive structure functions , including heavy quark mass effects , is on firm ground .",
    "the comparison of the charm component of this , @xmath27 , to measurement is , however , subject to some theoretical and experimental subtleties @xcite .",
    "previous comparison between the nlo 3-flavor calculation ( of order @xmath13 in this scheme ) @xcite with recent hera data @xcite showed good agreement .",
    "one can also compare the nlo 4-flavor calculation ( of order @xmath9 in this scheme ) with the same data @xcite .",
    "the results of this calculation are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : five ] , along with previous results .",
    "we see that the agreement with data is also excellent .",
    "this comparison tells us that , at least within the current experimental kinematic region , both 3-flavor and 4-flavor schemes are robust , in the sense that both can be applied to the full range without explicit evidence of the inadequacies expected from the theoretical considerations described in the previous section . in other words , both work better than expected .",
    "this is not guaranteed to hold indefinitely , however , for future expanded kinematic ranges . in fact , as we shall see , calculations show clear discrepancies between the two schemes at moderate @xmath28 ( say between 0.01 and 0.2 ) and large @xmath3",
    ".    it is encouraging that , the nlo 4-flavor ( order @xmath9 ) calculation in the general formalism appears to maintain good accuracy approaching the threshold region from above , since it enjoys the advantage of being much simpler than the 3-flavor nlo ( order @xmath13 ) calculation .",
    "this is important for phenomenology .",
    "for instance , in global qcd analysis of parton distributions , the charm contribution to the total inclusive cross - section is quite significant  up to 25% at small x. since the total inclusive structure functions are always treated in the variable flavor number scheme ( vfns ) , the charm component is naturally treated the same way .",
    "furthermore , the 4-flavor scheme is inherently more versatile than the 3-flavor scheme .",
    "it can accommodate , in principle , one more non - perturbative degree of freedom  a charm component inside the nucleon  which is non - existent in the 3-flavor scheme . in view of the dilemma confronting the phenomenology of bottom production described in the introduction ,",
    "it is important to leave open the possibility of unexpected non - perturbative heavy quark contribution to the structure of the nucleon .",
    "only detailed phenomenological study done in the vfns will be able to tell whether such components actually exist in nature .",
    "these considerations suggest that it is important to examine in more detail implementation issues of the vfns schemes ( in which heavy quarks participate as partons )  issues associated with the choice of prescriptions near the threshold region , which affect the predictive power of the calculation .",
    "in this section , we will quickly summarize the general features of the various existing calculations of open heavy flavor production in the vfns , then focus on the practical issues related to implementation choices .",
    "all the approaches should agree at high energies , within the accuracy of the perturbative approach .",
    "the differences are mainly in the threshold region , where heavy quark partons are less well - defined ( as discussed in sec .  [ sec : convappr ] ) , hence the perturbation theory contains more prescription dependence .",
    "we will show , however , that other relevant physical considerations , especially kinematic constraints of the overall heavy flavor production process , can provide valuable input which considerably improves the predictive power of the calculation .",
    "the fixed - flavor - number scheme is the scheme of choice in the threshold region , provided there is no non - perturbative heavy flavor component of the nucleon .",
    "it provides more definitive predictions in this region , and it respects the heavy quark production kinematics . hence its results can be used for comparing and calibrating the different prescriptions for performing variable flavor calculations .",
    "this will guide our analysis which follows .    for simplicity",
    ", we continue to restrict ourselves to the case of 4-flavor scheme calculation of charm production in dis to order @xmath9 .",
    "all ideas apply to higher orders , and to bottom production .      since the original formulation of ( non - zero mass )",
    "4-flavor scheme @xcite , a variety of variable flavor number scheme ( vfns ) calculations have been applied to photo- @xcite , lepto- @xcite , and hadro - production @xcite of charm . in spite of apparent differences in formulation and implementation , the underlying ideas described in sec .",
    "[ sec : convappr ] are adopted by all these calculations .",

    "the first ( lo 4-flv scheme ) term is variously called the flavor - excitation , or quark - scattering , or resummed term  as the 4-flv scheme resums the large logarithms associated with the mass of the charm quark .",
    "the third ( lo 3-flv scheme ) term is variously referred to as the flavor - creation , or gluon - fusion , or fixed - flavor - number term  since the charm quark never becomes an active parton flavor .",
    "the middle ( asymptotic / subtract ) term represents the overlap between the lo 3-flv scheme and lo 4-flv scheme terms ; hence it needs to be subtracted in order to avoid double - counting .    at high energies , the asymptotic",
    "/ subtract term contains the logarithmic mass singularities of the 3-flv scheme calculation .",
    "it constitutes the subtraction which is needed to make the latter infra - red safe .",
    "together , they form part of the next - order correction to the dominant resummed lo 4-flv scheme term , which gives the most accurate physical picture at high energies ( cf .  sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "in contrast , near the threshold region , the same subtraction term overlaps strongly with the first ( flavor excitation ) term , since in this region the charm parton arises primarily from a single gluon splitting , as seen in the pictorial illustration . in this region ,",
    "the lo 3-flv scheme ( third ) term gives the best representation of the correct physics , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] . in a consistent application of the pqcd formalism",
    ", the subtraction term is automatically generated by the renormalization and factorization procedure , as shown in @xcite .",
    "however , this procedure does not dictate every detail of the implementation .",
    "it allows some degree of prescription - dependence , which is in addition to the already well - known scheme dependence of massless pqcd .",
    "the prescription - dependence associated with non - zero charm quark mass is most noticeable at a low energy scale , not far above threshold . in principle , this dependence can be minimized by choosing the transition scale @xmath26 from the 3-flv scheme to the 4-flv scheme ( cf .",
    "[ sec : genframe ] ) to be relatively high .",
    "however , in practice , it is desirable to use the 4-flv scheme even at lower energy scales for reasons discussed in the introduction and at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : result1 ] .",
    "accordingly , we will examine in some detail the implementation issues of the 4-flv scheme , using pqcd as well as other applicable physical constraints , and see to what extent can its range of predictions be narrowed .",
    "consider one of the inclusive structure functions in dis .",
    "the factorization theorem , including quark mass effects @xcite , takes the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the parton distribution function , @xmath32 is the hard scattering amplitude calculated in pqcd to some power of @xmath33 say @xmath15 ) , and @xmath1 is the heavy quark mass .",
    "the prescription - dependence allowed by the pqcd formalism is associated with possible implementations of the first term of eq .",
    "[ eq : f ] within the accuracy specified by the order of magnitude of the remainder term .",
    "for the case we use as an illustration , the factorization formula consists of the three terms given in eq .",

    "[ eq : a ] ) , and the hard cross - section @xmath36 contains the full heavy quark mass dependence . note that , at high @xmath3 values ( @xmath37 ) , the rescaling variable reduces to @xmath28 , @xmath38 .",
    "the first two terms of eq.[eq : b ] ( the lo resummed and the subtraction terms ) contain the main prescription - dependent mass effects .",
    "different versions of the vfns scheme in the literature mostly amount to different prescriptions to implement heavy quark mass effects of these terms or their equivalents ( cf .",
    "[ sec : compare ] ) .",
    "it is therefore important to examine the origin of the prescription - dependence , and to identify implementations which are physically reasonable and which lead to numerically stable results .",

    "thus , at high energies , the charm quark behaves just like a light quark . at low energies , the exact treatment of @xmath39 and @xmath40",

    "this generic phase - space factor is a necessary consequence of the fact that the heavy quark is produced in pairs .    in dis , @xmath56 ; it is the same as the @xmath57 variable appearing in the gluon fusion term in eq .",

    "[ eq : b ]  the final state does consist of two heavy quarks , even though only one explicitly appears in the hard scattering part .",
    "we can implement the correct kinematics for the resummed and the subtraction terms by choosing the variable @xmath60 .",

    "but , ( i ) it is inadequate for the more general purpose of global qcd analysis since other hard processes require a more general vfns ; ( ii ) it will become unreliable at some higher energy scale which can not be predicted by pqcd ; and ( iii ) it is intrinsically unequipped to include non - perturbative heavy flavor degrees of freedom should these occur in nature .",

    "it is important to have a general pqcd formalism which is applicable over the full range of energy scales .",
    "such a framework ( `` vfns '' with non - zero quark masses ) exists @xcite , and is on a firm theoretical basis @xcite .",
    "it is conceptually simple .",

    "currently , there exist several different versions of the vfns of varying degree of complexity and naturalness .",
    "all implementations approach the same high energy limit given by the conventional zero - mass pqcd .",
    "however , so far , most prescriptions are sensitive in the threshold region to the ad hoc choices made in their implementation ; some exhibit artificial features in this region as a result .",
    "we point out in this talk that the main source of these problems lies in the lack of proper treatment of kinematics in the resummed term(s ) of the vfns , due to the neglect of the missing heavy particle in the target fragment .",
    "once this neglect is remedied ( by the use of the natural rescaling variable ) , a simple and general method to implement the vfns emerges .",
    "this method yields amazingly stable and accurate results for charm production already at order @xmath9 ( which is nlo in this scheme )  remaining uncertainties due to scale choice and higher - order corrections are shown to be small .",

    "<S> heavy flavor production is an important qcd process both in its own right and as a key component of precision global qcd analysis . </S>",

    "<S> we review existing methods of calculation , and place them in the context of the general pqcd framework of collins . </S>",
    "<S> a distinction is drawn between scheme dependence and implementation issues related to quark mass effects near threshold . </S>",
    "<S> we point out a so far overlooked kinematic constraint on the threshold behavior , which greatly simplifies the variable flavor number scheme . </S>",
