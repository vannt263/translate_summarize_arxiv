    "the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe  @xcite in combination with other cosmological observations implies that a component of the universe called dark energy constitutes about @xmath7 of the energy density of the universe .",
    "this original work has been confirmed by more sensitive observations  @xcite .",
    "it is known that a contribution to the vacuum energy density acts like a negative pressure in einstein s field equations , and since pressure gravitates it can cause the expansion of the universe to accelerate .",
    "there is no consensus on the nature and physical origin of dark energy , and most of the proposed research in this area consists of astronomical observations to more precisely characterize its effects on the universe s expansion rate and other cosmological and astronomical observables .",
    "however there is an interesting subset of ideas for the origin of dark energy which can be addressed in laboratory experiments .",
    "one set of such ideas postulate that dark energy is due to a scalar field @xmath8 which adopts a nonzero value in the vacuum of outer space . for this scalar field to evolve into the dark energy seen today , one must postulate a self - interaction and dynamical screening mechanism to explain why it has not been observed in previous precision gravitational measurements .    in this paper",
    "we specifically address a particular example of such a screened scalar field called the chameleon field  @xcite .",
    "the chameleon field has a nonlinear potential of the form @xmath9",
    "@xcite with @xmath6 the ratra - peebles index and @xmath10=2.4 mev based on the acceleration rate of the universe expansion .",
    "additionally , it has an extra term that couples to matter field @xmath11 , where @xmath1 is a dimensionless coupling to matter and @xmath12 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "so the effective potential takes the form @xmath13 .",
    "the appearance of the local matter density @xmath14 in the effective potential makes the effective mass @xmath15 of the chameleon field density - dependent , allowing the chameleon to evade many of the existing experimental tests of gravity .",
    "this also causes the chameleon field to be highly suppressed in the presence of even the modestly low matter density environment present in most terrestrial lab experiments where the effective mass is extremely heavy , thus further escaping detection . as a result , the chameleon field ,",
    "along with a range of similar theories , has yet to be ruled out by experiment .",
    "a very extensive review of the chameleon field within the broader context of modified gravity theories has appeared recently  @xcite .",
    "this paper presents the result of a recent experiment using a perfect crystal neutron interferometer to place a limit on the chameleon field s coupling to matter @xmath1 and does so in a particularly direct , transparent manner .",
    "we actively modulate the amplitude of the chameleon scalar field in a gas cell in one arm of our interferometer and exploit the unique ability of neutrons to coherently penetrate the cell wall and access the phase shift from the neutron - chameleon coupling .",
    "this research activity brings together several physics subfields ( gravitational physics , atomic physics , condensed matter physics ) and in the neutron case employs centralized user facilities constructed mainly for materials science studies , thereby involving an uncommon diversity of scientific research techniques and environments in the quest to experimentally address what is perhaps the most exciting issue in cosmology .    in the regime of small matter coupling @xmath1 the best laboratory constraints on chameleons over a wide range of @xmath6",
    "come from laboratory tests of the inverse square law of gravity with sensitivity at the @xmath16 micron dark energy scale  @xcite .",
    "experimental tests of the gravitational inverse square law operating over other distance regimes , such as those designed originally to measure the casimir interaction , can also constrain @xmath1 .",
    "the sensitivity of a force sensor specially designed to search for chameleons has recently been analyzed  @xcite .    in the regime of large @xmath1 techniques which employ two large masses",
    "start to become insensitive because both the source and sink of the chameleon field emanate only from a thin region of the surface of the objects due to the nonlinear chameleon self - shielding , and it is therefore preferable in this regime to employ test particles whose presence does not suppress the chameleon field . neutron and atom interferometry can be used to search for the possible existence of chameleon and related scalar fields in this strongly - coupled chameleon regime since these probes do not locally suppress the chameleon field .",
    "slow neutrons can be used to perform sensitive searches for dark energy scalar fields  @xcite .",
    "the fact that neutron experiments are a sensitive method to probe chameleon fields was pointed out by  @xcite in the context of an analysis of measurements on the quantum states of bouncing ultra - cold neutrons .",
    "the disturbance of the chameleon field near the surface of the flat neutron mirror employed in these measurements modifies the neutron bound state energies and wave functions as well as the relative phase of coherent superpositions of the neutron gravitational bound states .",
    "recent experiments conducted in this system  @xcite have been used to constrain chameleon fields , and elaborations of this method are in principle capable of much greater sensitivity .",
    "other neutron tests involving an apparatus used to test the weak equivalence principle for free neutrons  @xcite and a lloyd s mirror type of neutron interferometer  @xcite have also been proposed .",
    "a recent review of calculations performed to search for dark energy of various types using neutrons , laboratory experiments to search for casimir forces , and gravitational inverse square law violations has recently appeared  @xcite .",
    "calculations which showed that atoms can feel an unscreened chameleon field  @xcite have encouraged experiments to search for chameleons using atom interferometry .",
    "the first result of an atom interferometry experiment conducted to search for chameleons has appeared very recently  @xcite .",
    "this experiment looked for a phase shift in a cesium atom interferometer operated in ultrahigh vacuum near a spherical mass which can be a source of a chameleon field .",
    "already the constraints on the coupling @xmath1 from this atom interferometry experiment are quite strong .",
    "the prospects for further improvement in the atom interferometry experiments are very encouraging  @xcite .",
    "as the chameleon fields must couple directly to mass to be relevant for the observed universe expansion acceleration , other possible chameleon probes such as photons possess a more model - dependent coupling to these dark energy scalar fields .",
    "strong experimental constraints on chameleon - photon couplings already exist .",
    "examples of photon - based searches for chameleons include the chase ( the gammev chameleon afterglow search ) experiment  @xcite , the axion dark matter experiment ( admx )  @xcite , a search for chameleon particles created via photon - chameleon oscillations within a magnetic field  @xcite , and the cast cern axion solar telescope experiment  @xcite .",
    "most of the chameleon experiments performed to date using neutrons and atoms have sought the chameleon field by passing the probe close to a dense mass inside a high vacuum environment and searching for the phase shift from the chameleon - matter coupling @xmath1 in a chameleon field gradient .",
    "the chameleon field profile is obtained by solving the appropriate nonlinear klein - gordon equation for @xmath8 using the boundary conditions set by the experimental apparatus .",
    "a special feature of the experiment reported in this work is that we periodically introduce a nonzero matter density into the experimental chamber to actively suppresses the chameleon field in the measurement . to perform this type of search",
    "we exploit the fact that , unlike atoms , neutrons are able to pass through matter at densities ( gas pressures of a few mbar suffice ) for which the chameleon field is greatly suppressed .",
    "we were able to realize an experiment in which the chameleon field in the apparatus seen by the neutrons is repeatedly  turned off \" by the addition of a small gas pressure in the apparatus and  turned on \" by evacuation of the chamber .",
    "moreover , using a neutron interferometer provides another advantage in that we can keep the pressure difference between the two arms of interferometer constant .",
    "this provides a direct measurement of any background that is independent of gas pressure , such as neutron scattering off the cell walls etc .",
    "the experiment was performed at the national institute of standards and technology s ( nist ) center for neutron research ( ncnr ) located in gaithersburg , md . at the ncnr",
    "free neutrons are generated using a 20 mw research reactor which feeds over two dozen individual instruments that are primarily tailored for material science applications .",
    "here we used monochromatic 11.1 mev neutrons and interferometric techniques similar to that of a mach - zehnder interferometer for light optics  @xcite .",
    "the perfect crystal neutron interferometer used in this experiment consists of three crystal blades on a common crystal base ; a schematic of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : interferometer ] .",
    "the monolithic silicon base below the blades ensures proper arcsecond alignment between the lattice planes of each of the three blades .",
    "the first blade serves to spatially separate the neutron s wave function @xmath17 into two coherent paths ( a and b ) . in order for the two paths interfere , a central crystal blade acts as a lossy mirror and directs the paths back together onto the third blade .",
    "neutrons exit the interferometer along either one of two paths labeled traditionally as ` o ' and ` h ' and are detected using highly efficient @xmath18he - filled proportional counters .",
    "it should be noted that there is only one neutron at a time inside the interferometer and thus it is a elegant example of macroscopic self interference .",
    "differences in phase @xmath19 between the paths a and b modulates the intensities recorded by the detectors as @xmath20 \\label{io } \\\\",
    "\\label{eqn2 } i_h = a_h - b\\cos[\\xi(\\delta)+\\delta\\phi ] \\label{ih}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to determine @xmath19 and the other fit parameters ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) one could vary the cosine term in a controllable way ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "this is done by the adding what is called a ` phase flag ' inside the interferometer .",
    "the phase flag used here is a 1.5 mm thick @xmath24 50 mm wide piece of optically flat quartz and is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : interferometer]b . by rotating the phase flag",
    "an angle @xmath25 a phase shift of @xmath23 is caused due to the effective path length difference between paths a and b. rotating @xmath25 by @xmath262.5 degrees creates an interferogram like the one shown in fig [ fig : interferograms ] .",
    "the perfect crystal neutron interferometery technique employed in this work has been used to conduct a number of textbook experiments in gravitation , neutron optics , and quantum entanglement  @xcite .",
    "these experiments include , but are not limited to , ( 1 ) the first demonstration that the gravitational field affects neutron wave functions as expected in non - relativistic quantum mechanics , ( 2 ) clear demonstrations of the fascinating minus sign in the quantum amplitude of a spin-@xmath27 particle rotated by @xmath28 , ( 3 ) the most precise determinations of neutron - nucleus scattering amplitudes , ( 4 ) sensitive tests of quantum entanglement predictions such as the bell inequalities and the greenberger - horne - zeilinger inequalities , and ( 5 ) subtle effects in neutron optics , most recently the successful manipulation of the orbital angular momentum quantum number of a neutron beam  @xcite .",
    "our experiment searches for the neutron phase shift between the two coherent paths of the interferometer arising from the coupling of the neutron to the chameleon field .",
    "the neutron phase shift @xmath29 due to the chameleon scalar field is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mass of the neutron , @xmath32 is the chameleon field , @xmath33 is the neutron wave vector , and the integration is performed over the neutron s trajectory .",
    "we use the sign convention that defines the neutron phase such that positive potentials give negative phases . by measuring @xmath29 ,",
    "we can then limit @xmath1 for a given ratra - peebles index @xmath6 .",
    "the calculation of the chameleon phase shift requires integrating over the neutron trajectory of the chameleon field profile @xmath32 inside the cell as a function of the gas density .",
    "previous calculations have shown  @xcite that @xmath32 is a rapidly varying function of the density of the gas .",
    "when the gas density is low the chameleon field @xmath32 develops a nonzero amplitude for distances sufficiently far from the walls of the vacuum chamber .",
    "as the gas density is raised into a critical regime , which depends on @xmath1 and the geometry of cell , the chameleon field @xmath32 is suppressed and tends toward zero .",
    "we can therefore actively modulate the chameleon field in the experiment .    the first experiment to use perfect crystal neutron interferometry to search for chameleon scalar fields",
    "was recently performed at institut laue - langevin ( ill )  @xcite . in this experiment",
    "neutrons also passed through a vacuum chamber mounted in the perfect crystal interferometer .",
    "the effect of the chameleon field was sought both by varying the relative separation of the neutron paths from the vacuum cell walls by translating the cell relative to the incident beam and also by varying the pressure inside the cell . since the former is limited by the uniformity of a machined cell , in our experiment we employed the pressure variation method .",
    "a two - chamber vacuum cell is placed in the perfect crystal neutron interferometer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : interferometer]b ) with internal pressures controlled at different values . the vacuum cell as well as",
    "the two neutron beams are both symmetric about the center walls of vacuum cell , so those two neutron beams should feel exactly the same chameleon field if the pressure inside is same",
    ". however the neutron interferometer works in such way that it detects the difference between the two neutron beams so we need to control the pressure of the two chambers at different levels .",
    "first ( conf .",
    "1 ) , the pressure in the right chamber is kept low so that the chameleon field can develop a nonzero value . meanwhile , the left chamber is filled with gas at a higher pressure so that the chameleon field is highly suppressed",
    ". then ( conf .",
    "2 ) , the gas pressure in each chamber is raised by the same amount so that the chameleon field gets suppressed in both chambers .",
    "so the four phase shift neutron picks up during the experiment are , @xmath34 ideally , the phase shift due to chameleon in @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 should be close to zero so we define the phase shift of chameleon to be @xmath38 .",
    "the helium gas pressures in the cell in either configuration are low enough that the equation of state of the helium gas is well - described by the ideal gas law .",
    "the gas density and resulting neutron phase shift from the neutron optical potential of the helium gas is then proportional to the gas pressure . at these low gas densities",
    "the neutron phase shift from the helium gas is a few orders of magnitude smaller than the ultimate sensitivity of our experiment to phase shifts from the chameleon field , so in practice @xmath39 can be neglected .",
    "furthermore , even if the phase shift from the gas was larger , our active control of the pressure difference between the two sides of the cell in the two configurations would cause this phase shift difference @xmath40 to cancel to high accuracy .",
    "the phase shift difference from the two cell walls in the two different configurations , @xmath41 is also negligible : the only physically plausible mechanism that might cause a difference , namely some absolute - pressure - dependent change of the phase shift from the neutron optical potential of the aluminum cell walls , is known to be negligible from previous measurements at much higher gas pressures at the ncnr of the neutron - helium optical potential . under these conditions , @xmath42 is a clean and direct measurement of the chameleon phase shift .",
    "table [ table : pressure ] shows the two sets of pressure configurations that are used in the experiment .",
    "the setpoint  in the table refers to a low enough pressure at which the chameleon field may produce an extra phase shift .",
    "the choice of gas pressures used in this experiment are also low enough that , for the chameleon coupling strengths to which we are sensitive , the chameleon field sees the helium gas used in the cell as a homogeneous medium based on previous analysis of this issue  @xcite .    in the experiment",
    "we choose to control the absolute pressure ( the low pressure side in fig .",
    "[ fig : interferometer ] ) and the differential pressure across two chambers to eliminate possible systematic effects as discussed above . the absolute pressures in conf .",
    "2 will deviate slightly from the expected @xmath43 mbar and @xmath44 mbar shown in table [ table : pressure ] because the absolute pressure gauge used in this experiment has a maximum measuring range of 0 - @xmath45 mbar .",
    "so instead of measuring the pressures in conf .  2",
    "directly , the differential pressure gauge , which can measure up to @xmath43 mbar , is used to achieve the desired pressures in conf .  2 .",
    "we measured the associated pressure uncertainty to be smaller than @xmath46 mbar .",
    "this gives a negligible systematic uncertainty since the chameleon field amplitude is close to zero at such high pressure and it is only logarithmically sensitive to the pressure in this regime .",
    "[ fig : ghs ] shows the schematic of the gas handling system ( ghs ) used in this experiment .",
    "the vacuum cell is made of aluminum alloy 7075 .",
    "two cf flanges are machined on the two ends of the cell to accommodate aluminum gasket seals with negligible outgassing .",
    "a wall of thickness 3 mm separates the cell into two chambers which can be filled by gas at different pressures .",
    "the ghs employs metal seals ( cf 1 - 1/3  ) and ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) compatible components which are helium leak tight as verified by measurements using a helium leak detector .",
    "all the vacuum tubes and the mechanical bellows have a high - conductance path to the cell ( tubing diameters are greater than 2 cm ) so the pressure gradient inside the gas handling system is minimized .",
    "two absolute pressure capacitance transducers and one differential capacitance transducer are placed close to the vacuum cell and used to monitor the absolute pressure and differential pressure across the vacuum cell .",
    "two types of feedback loops control the pressures inside the cells .",
    "one controls the differential pressure across the chamber using a motorized edge - welded stainless uhv bellows according to readings from the differential pressure gauge .",
    "the other feedback control employs an absolute pressure gauge and a vacuum compatible sensitive mass flow controller to control the pressure in the low pressure chamber .",
    "all valves are controlled by air - actuated switches to reduce possible electromagnetic or vibrational noise in the interferometer environment .",
    "both absolute pressure and differential pressure are controlled with fractional fluctuations below @xmath47 .",

    "we have conducted a search for chameleon dark energy fields using neutron interferometry .",
    "we realized an experiment in which the chameleon field is periodically varied in magnitude with no change in the experimental geometry .",
    "our upper bound of @xmath2 for a ratra - peebles index of @xmath3 to @xmath4 for @xmath5 is the most sensitive direct constraint on the free neutron - chameleon coupling in the strong coupling regime of the theory .",
    "it is more sensitive than a recent neutron interferometer experiment at the ill  @xcite by about a factor of @xmath48 for @xmath3 to a factor of @xmath49 at @xmath50 , and it cuts into part of the projected sensitivity of a proposed experiment using an optimized force sensor  @xcite . the constraints from this work on the chameleon are consistent with but less stringent than a very recently - published atom interferometry experiment using cesium atoms  @xcite . under the assumption that chameleon dark energy obeys the gravitational equivalence principle and that there are no essential differences between the response of a neutron and a cesium atom to the chameleon field , the atom interferometer constraints are about two orders of magnitude more stringent at present",
    ".    this neutron interferometer experiment can be improved by ( a ) using an interferometer crystal with a larger path length , ( b ) improving the contrast of the interference signal in the interferometer , ( c ) optimizing further the pressure range of the measurements , ( d ) operating the interferometer on a more intense monochromatic neutron beam , and ( e ) varying the neutron coupling to the chameleon both by changing the cell geometry and also by varying the gas pressure . with these improvements",
    ", the statistical sensitivity of this measurement to the coupling @xmath1 can be improved by at least two more orders of magnitude with negligible systematic effects , which could then surpass the existing atom interferometer limits at larger @xmath6 .",
    "a experimental lower bound on @xmath51 for @xmath3 already exists from gravitational inverse square law tests . by improving the atom interferometry limits by another few orders of magnitude , laboratory experiments will either discover chameleons or provide the first experimental refutation of a plausible dark energy theory .",
