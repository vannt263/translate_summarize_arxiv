    "the character of the oscillations changes drastically in the limit @xmath220 . in this case",
    "the current and the voltage slowly move along the branches @xmath221 and @xmath222 of the ivc at the rate @xmath223 , quickly switching between these branches at the points @xmath23 and @xmath148 with the rate @xmath224 ( see fig .  [ limivbig ] ) . therefore , in this case the stack periodically switches between the parallel and antiparallel magnetic states ( see fig .  [ limthetabig ] ) .",
    "if the electric current flows in the plane of the layers ( cip ) of the stack the torque effect is insufficient or absent @xcite while the magneto - thermal - electric oscillations under consideration may take place . in this case",
    "the total current flowing through the cross - section of the layers may be presented as @xmath225 where @xmath98 and @xmath226 are the magneto - resistance and the angle - independent resistance of the stack in the cip set of the experiment .    in a cip configuration",
    "the stack is joule heated by both the angle - dependent and the angle - independent currents and hence eq.([heat ] ) should be re - written as follows : @xmath227 where @xmath228    using eq.([diffg(t ) ] ) and eq.([cip ] ) one finds that the presence of the angle - independent current in the stack modifies the condition of the negative differential conductance @xmath229 : it is negative if @xmath230   \\label{}\\ ] ] as is seen from here , an ivc with a negative differential resistance is possible if @xmath231 ( see eq.[[r ] ] for definitions of @xmath232 and @xmath233 ) .",
    "the time evolution of the system is described by the set of equations eq.([evolution ] ) in which one needs to change @xmath234 and @xmath235 . therefore , under this change",
    ", the temporal evolution of the system in a cip configuration is the same as when the current flows perpendicular to the stack layers : if the bias voltage corresponds to the negative differential conductance @xmath236 and the inductance exceeds the critical value @xmath237 where @xmath238 , self - excited oscillations of the current @xmath239 , voltage drop over the stack @xmath121 , the temperature @xmath5 and the angle @xmath96 arise in the system , the maximal frequency of which being @xmath240 if @xmath241    below we present estimations of the critical inductance and the oscillation frequency which are valid for both the above mentioned cpp and cip configurations of the experiment .    using equations eq.([steadysolution ] ) and eq.([criticalinductance ] ) one may estimate the order of magnitude of the critical inductance and the oscillation frequency as @xmath242 and @xmath243 where @xmath244 is the heat capacity per unit volume , @xmath245 is the resistivity , and @xmath246 is a characteristic size of the stack . for point contact devices with typical values of @xmath247 , @xmath248k , @xmath249 @xmath250 cm , @xmath251 and assuming that cooling of the device can provide the sample temperature @xmath252 one finds the characteristic values of the critical inductance and the oscillation frequency as @xmath253 and @xmath254",
    "the experimental implementation of the new principle proposed in this paper for the electrical manipulation of nanomagnetic conductors by means of a controlled joule heating of a point contact appears to be quite feasible .",
    "this conclusion is supported both by theoretical considerations and preliminary experimental results , as discussed in the main body of the paper .",
    "hence we expect the new spin - thermo - electronic oscillators that we propose to be realizable in the laboratory .",
    "we envision f0/f / f2 valves where two strongly ferromagnetic regions ( @xmath255 k ) are connected through a weakly ferromagnetic spacer ( @xmath256 k )",
    ". the curie temperature of the spacer would be variable on the scale of room temperature , chosen during fabrication to optimize the device performance .",
    "for example , doping ni - fe with @xmath257 of mo brings the @xmath258 from @xmath259 k to 300 - 400 k. alternatively , alloying ni with cu yields a spacer with a @xmath258 just above room temperature ( at rt or below rt , if needed ) . if a sufficient current density is created in the nano - tri - layer to raise the temperature to just above the @xmath258 of the spacer , the magnetic subsystem undergoes a transition from the f0/f / f2 state to an f0/n / f2 state , the latter being similar to conventional spin - valves ( n for nonmagnetic , paramagnetic in this case ) .",
    "such a transition should result in a large resistance change , of the same magnitude as the  giant magnetoresistance \" ( gmr ) for the particular material composition of the valve .",
    "local heating ( up to 1000 k over 10 - 50   nm ) can readily be produced using , e.g. , point contacts in the thermal regime , with very modest global circuit currents and essentially no global heating @xcite .",
    "heat is known to propagate through nm - sized objects on the ns time scale , which can be scaled with size to the sub - ns regime . when voltage - biased to generate a temperature near @xmath260 , such a f0/f / f2 device would oscillate between the two magnetic states , resulting in current oscillations of a frequency that can be tuned by means of connecting a variable inductance in series with the device .",
    "spin rotation frequencies may be tuned from the ghz - range down to quasi - dc ( or dc as soon as the inductance is smaller than the critical value ) . for f0/f / f2 structures geometrically designed in the style of the spin - flop free layer of today s magnetoresistive random access memory ( mram ) , the dipolar coupling between the two strongly ferromagnetic layers would make the anti - parallel state ( @xmath261 ) the magnetic ground state above @xmath260 .",
    "the thermal transition in the f - layer would then drive a full 180-degree spin - flop of the valve .",
    "the proposed spin - thermo - electronic valve can be implemented in cpp as well as cip geometry , which should make it possible to achieve mr signals of  10 .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that joule heating of the magnetic stack sketched in fig .",
    "[ noflip ] allows the relative orientation of the magnetization of the two ferromagnetic layers 0 and 2 to be electrically manipulated .",
    "based on this principle , we have proposed a novel spin - thermo - electronic oscillator concept and discussed how it can be implemented experimentally .",
