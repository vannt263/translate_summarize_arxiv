    "the accurate determination of kobayashi maskawa ( km ) matrix elements involving beauty quarks is an important but also very challenging task to both experimental and theoretical physics . on the theoretical side nonpertubative methods are indispensable to calculate the low energy qcd parts of the transition amplitudes .",
    "although lattice qcd is the method of choice in this context , it suffers from the fact that the b meson region is beyond currently reachable lattice resolutions .",
    "direct lattice calculations at the b meson mass would be contaminated by large discretization errors .    in the current project",
    "we are aiming at a high statistics determination , with about 100 independent configurations , of the relevant weak formfactors , at a lattice resolution of @xmath2 gev .",
    "this resolution allows to push forward into a mass region of @xmath3 , with tolerable discretization errors .",
    "we are running at four values of the heavy quark mass @xmath4 , with hopping parameters @xmath5 and four values of the light quark mass @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "this covers the physical regions @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively , providing us with sufficient lever arms for the extrapolations to @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    in this status report , we present the results of an intermediate analysis , based on 32 configurations .",
    "we consider the formfactors parametrizing the decay of pseudoscalar mesons , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and the corresponding decays into vector mesons , @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "they can be extracted from the groundstate properties of appropriate ratios @xmath16 of two- and three - point correlation functions@xcite .",
    "the three - point correlators are calculated using the well known insertion technique@xcite .    in our setup the initial meson",
    "is located at timeslice @xmath17 and carries no momentum , whereas the final meson is placed at timeslice @xmath18 and is furnished with altogether 11 lattice momenta , i.e. all combinations possible in the range @xmath19 , @xmath20 . the location in time of the effective elektroweak interaction",
    "is varied between @xmath21 and @xmath22 and must be chosen finally in the range of groundstate dominance , as signalled by the existence of a plateau .    in order to enhance groundstate signals we have applied wuppertal `` gaussian '' smearing@xcite to all boundstate quarks , with an average radius of @xmath23 .",
    "we obtain clear plateaus for all relevant ratios @xmath16 with momenta @xmath24 in the range @xmath25 . for higher",
    "momenta the signals start getting noisy and a safe identification of the plateau region becomes increasingly difficult .",
    "in order to extract the km matrix elements from experimental measurements of decay widths and branching ratios one conveniently uses the values of the formfactors at @xmath27 .",
    "a natural guide for the extrapolation in @xmath26 is the pole dominance hypothesis @xmath28 @xmath29 denotes generically the formfactors given above and @xmath30 is the mass of the lightest meson exchanged in the @xmath31 channel .",
    "the ansatz can be checked by the `` high momentum transfer '' data , at @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    -0.7 cm = 7.0 cm -0.8 cm    in fig.[pole_dominance ] we show -0.5 cm the @xmath26 dependence of the formfactors for a given combination of quark masses",
    ". the solid line corresponds to a fit to eq.[q2_dep ] , where we have included only the most reliable low momentum results .",
    "we find reasonable consistency of all data with the pole dominance hypothesis .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the extrapolation to @xmath34 depends only weakly on the details of the ansatz as it is short ranged .",
    "the charm quark region is directly accessed by our calculation . after extrapolation in @xmath26 and in the light quark mass @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    "we find    -1.1 cm = 7.0 cm -1.5 cm    -1.25 cm @xmath38 and @xmath39 a discussion of the issue of the renormalization constants of the vector- and axial vector - currents , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , will follow in section 6 .",
    "the @xmath42 meson can be accessed only by extrapolation in the heavy quark mass .",
    "the heavy quark effective theory predicts@xcite @xmath43 if both the initial and the final quark are `` heavy '' . in fig.[isgur_plot ] we display our heavy quark results together with a fit to eq.[isgur_wise ] .",
    "obviously the data , within the present statistics , is well described by eq.[isgur_wise ] , and we obtain for the transitions @xmath44    -1.2 cm = 7.0 cm -0.3 cm",
    "in order to convert the above lattice data into continuum results , we need the renormalization constants @xmath40 and @xmath41 of the vector and axialvector currents . they can be calculated in perturbation theory , but the estimation of the systematic error is difficult in this case .",
    "one year ago c.w .",
    "bernard @xcite argued that the renormalization constant of the local vector current @xmath40 depends strongly on the mass of the quarks involved .",
    "following his arguments this undesired mass dependence can be removed if the ( standard ) @xmath45 normalization of the quark fields is replaced by the kronfeld - mackenzie(kromac ) @xcite prescription .    as a first step to check this issue we display in fig.[psvkps ] the mass dependence of the matrix element @xmath46 with the standard and with the kromac normalization .",
    "we have also included the result for the conserved current @xmath47 , which is expected to be 1 in the standard normalization because of the corresponding ward identity .      in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will extend the above considerations to the space components of the vector and axialvector currents .",
