    "the increasing interest for nanoscience and nanotechnology has evidenced the importance of the scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) to explore the nature at atomic scale . in this context graphene ,",
    "a novel layered material with potential technological applications @xcite , has been intensively characterized by stm techniques and has revealed its surprising behavior : edge states at the border @xcite , superstructures @xcite and van hove singularities @xcite .",
    "the graphene particularities were implied before by stm characterization of the ( 0001 ) surface of highly oriented pyrolitic graphite ( hopg ) : difficulties to obtain stm complete atomic resolution as well the observation of superstructures are examples of this .",
    "extending the preceding statements , let us precise that graphene is a stable bidimensional structure formed by carbon atoms ordered in a hexagonal lattice ( the first neighbor distance is @xmath1  ) . in crystalline graphite ( hopg ) such layers",
    "are stacked on each other in a @xmath2 sequence , and therefore it is possible to identify two type of atomic sites : the @xmath3-type sites , corresponding to atoms with neighbors directly above and below in adjacent layers ; and the @xmath4-type sites , which do not have direct neighbors in the adjacent layers .",
    "an important consequence of the crystalline structure of hopg is that near the fermi level the bulk presents a local density of states ( ldos ) which is larger for atoms on @xmath4-type sites @xcite .",
    "the theory of stm image formation @xcite considers that the accessible states by stm are those in the energy window @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "consequently in hopg only those atoms on @xmath4-type sites appears visible for a stm operating at low bias voltages and they form the triangular lattice usually reported on experiments .",
    "however the ldos of @xmath3 and @xmath4 sites tends to be equal by increasing the bias voltages and the persistence of the triangular lattice at higher bias voltages has been explained by resolution losses introduced for the stm tip size @xcite .",
    "following the preceding ideas , the observation of superstructures during stm experiments can be explained by considering a relative rotation among the constituent graphene layers .",
    "this is because rotations generate _ moir patterns _ where it is possible to identify regions with a high concentration of @xmath4-type sites , called @xmath6 sites , and regions with a high concentration of @xmath3-type sites , called @xmath7 or @xmath0 stacked regions [ see figure [ figure0](a ) ] . in both cases @xmath8 stands for _ giant _ @xcite . in this frame",
    "the @xmath6 regions would appear brilliant in stm images due to the large ldos of atoms on @xmath4 sites @xcite . however , rong and kuiper @xcite , on base of first principles dos calculations @xcite , proposed that brilliant zones occur over the @xmath7 regions .",
    "aditionally a third explanation for the superstructures considers that more important than the electronic effects induced by rotation between weakly interactive graphene layers , could be surface deformations introduced by stm tip while it scans the surface ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this has been a long standing controversy which has attracted renewed interest over the stm image formation of graphite surface @xcite and over the physical origin of superstructures @xcite .    in this context , an important tool to analyze the effect of rotation among graphene layers",
    "is the calculation of stm images and the corresponding contrast with experimental data . following this objective we have focused in the task of generate stm images for different rotation angles between two graphene layers .",
    "we have organized this paper as follows : details of the images calculation are given in next section ; theoretical results are summarized in section [ sec3 ] and finally the main conclusions are presented .",
    "the system under study corresponds to blg presenting a relative rotation angle between its layers ( twisted bilayer graphene ) .",
    "such rotation occurs around the stacking direction and despite for any angle one can identify a superstructure ( or moir pattern ) only for very particular angles the misoriented layers are in commensuration @xcite .",
    "a commensurable unit supercell requieres a rotation from a vector @xmath9 to @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the graphene basis vectors ; @xmath13 and @xmath14 are integers and @xmath15  is the lattice constant .",
    "the commensurable rotation angle is defined by    @xmath16    and the unit super cell vectors correspond to : @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the unit supercell contains @xmath19 atoms and its periodicity results @xmath20 $ ] @xcite .",
    "thus , commensurable unit supercells are complety defined by the index @xmath13 and @xmath14 and those selected to this study appear in table [ table1 ] with their corresponding number of atoms @xmath21 , rotation angle between layers @xmath22 and periodicity @xmath23 .",
    "for example , the unit supercell for twisted bilayer graphene with the angle @xmath24 is shown in figure [ figure0](b ) .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our dft calculations were carried out using the siesta _ ab initio _",
    "package @xcite which employ norm - conserving pseudopotentials and localized atomic orbitals as basis set .",
    "double-@xmath25 plus polarization functions were used under the local density approximation @xcite .",
    "all structures were fully relaxed until the atomic forces are smaller than 0.02  ev /  .",
    "we consider supercells with periodic boundary conditions for the plane layers , while in the perpendicular direction to the layers plane the separation between slabs is fixed to 14   .",
    "the brillouin zone sampling was performed using a monkhorst - pack mesh of @xmath26 .",
    "the images were obtained using the code _ stm _ 1.0.1 ( included in the siesta package ) .",
    "this code uses the wavefunctions generated by siesta and computed on a reference plane and extrapolates the value of these wavefunctions into vacuum .",
    "such reference plane must be sufficiently close to the surface so that the charge density is large and well described .",
    "the stm data is generated under the tersoff - hamann theory @xcite , while data visulization was possible using the wsxm 5.0 freeware @xcite .",
    "gaussian smooth was performed to obtain the final stm image .",
    "electronic properties and constant height mode stm images were calculated for the five commensurable supercells presented in table [ table1 ] .",
    "figure [ figure3 ] shows band structure and total density of states ( dos ) for three of these twisted bilayer graphene . clearly , a decrease of the rotation angle @xmath22 diminishes the energy difference between the vhs near the fermi level .",
    "this effect was reported in previous works @xcite and has its origin in the renormalization of dirac electrons velocities , which is observed in the band structures as a decreasing in the slope of the dirac cone .",
    "additionally the vhss show the well known asymmetry between electrons and holes , which is observed as a difference in the height of the vhss .",
    "these theoretical predictions have been recently corroborated by stm / sts experimental measurements on twisted graphene layers with @xmath27 @xcite and ensure us that our calculations reproduce the main electronic characteristics of the twisted bilayer graphene .",
    "as the occupied states contributing to the stm image are in the energy window [ @xmath28 @xcite , the stm image bias voltage dependence was studied by considering several values in the range @xmath29 v @xmath30 v. as example , figure [ figure1 ] shows calculated stm images and their corresponding line profiles for the case @xmath31 v and the tip - to - surface distance @xmath32  .",
    "these calculated stm images show bright zones indicating tunnel current maxima , which form triangular structures with periodicities much larger than the graphite lattice constant .",
    "superlattice constants _ correspond to the periodicities @xmath23 shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "another important result derived from these calculations is that the brilliant zones are over the @xmath0 stacked regions in accordance with the proposal of other authors : rong and kuiper @xcite and campanera et al .",
    "@xcite , who based their conclusions in dos calculations for different stacking sequence of graphite @xcite ; and trambly de laissardiere et al .",
    "@xcite , who combined tight - binding with ab - initio calculations to study the ldos on twisted bilayer graphene .",
    "line profiles were performed along the segment indicated in each stm image of figure [ figure1 ] . although the calculated images correspond to constant height mode , the line profiles might be compared with those experimentally obtained in constant current mode assuming that depressions in the charge density lead to proportional approximations of the tip - to - the - surface in order to keep the tunnel current constant .",
    "so , our results show two important features revealed also during the stm experiments : a roughnes presenting the graphite periodicity and a large oscilation amplitude presenting the superlattice periodicity @xcite . for the first case , the roughnes",
    "reflects the electronic charge accumulation at the atomic sites , which is detected by stm tip .",
    "for the second case , the oscillation amplitude is much more larger than the roughness due to the atomic sites and it has been named `` giant '' or `` superlattice corrugation '' @xcite .",
    "clearly our calculations suggests that the physical origin of the _ superlattice corrugation _ is mainly an electronic effect and consequently the wide gamma of alternative explanations ( see @xcite and references therein ) seems to be less important at least for stm images of blg",
    ". also we found , coinciding with the experimental observations on graphite surfaces @xcite , that bias voltage has a strong influence in the _ superlattice corrugation amplitude _",
    "figure [ figure4 ] shows sca obtained from calculated stm for the rotation angles under study and with different bias voltages .",
    "the sca corresponding to @xmath33 is the smaller one and presents a current maximum at @xmath34 v. such sca maximum seems to be a consequence of the dos which , in the case @xmath35 , shows the first vhs at @xmath36 v. of course the main contribution to this vhs comes from the local density of states ( ldos ) over the @xmath0 stacked regions , but the decrease of sca for @xmath37 v is evidence that from that value other regions start to contribute to the dos . for lower rotation angles , as i.e. @xmath38 and @xmath24",
    ", the first vhs occurs closer to the fermi energy ( see fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] ) and its main contribution comes from the @xmath0 stacked regions .",
    "however when the bias voltage increases over 2.0 v the ldos from other regions start to contribute equally and sca starts to diminish .",
    "such behavior for the ldos was also experimentally revealed by sts on the bright and dark regions of stm data @xcite .    on the other hand the stm dependence on the tip - to - sample distance ( @xmath39 )",
    "was also studied by considering different values in the range @xmath40  @xmath41 @xmath42  .",
    "thus , the present stm image generation methodology shows that the tip - to - surface distance has no consequence in the calculated stm images and current intensity maxima remain over the regions with large concentration of @xmath3-sites ( @xmath0 regions ) .",
    "this result indicates that the stm image generation methodology is well defined in the @xmath39 range considered , but does no give definitive conclusions about tip - to - sample distance dependences as those theoretically predicted @xcite and experimentally observed @xcite for trilayer graphene case .",
    "from ab - initio methods we have calculated constant heigth mode stm images for twisted graphene bilayer presenting five commensurable rotation angles .",
    "the calculated images show superstructures as those revealed during stm characterization of graphite surface and reproduce their main features .",
    "in particular the line profiles , obtained from the calculated images , show two important features experimentally observed : a large oscillation amplitude ( giant corrugation ) with the periodicity of the superstructures ; and a roughness with the graphene lattice periodicity .",
    "thus , these results are showing that the superstructures have a strong electronic origin and , therefore , mechanical tip - sample interaction , or another physical grounds , are not always relevant to explain the phenomena .",
    "three additional important conclusions derived from this study must be remarked : first , despite the weak interlayer interaction , a relative rotation between them can modify considerably the surface electronic structure ; second , results show clearly that , for twisted bilayer graphene , the current intensity maxima appear over @xmath0 stacked regions ; and third , the bias voltage has a strong influence in the _ superlattice corrugation _ amplitude .",
