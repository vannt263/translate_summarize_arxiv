    "the @xmath0 resonance has been a longstanding example of a quasi - bound state of meson and baryon appearing naturally in scattering theory with coupled channels  @xcite .",
    "modern formulations combining the chiral effective theory with unitary frameworks all lead to the dynamical generation of this resonance in the meson - baryon scattering  @xcite .",
    "yet , it was shown that in some models , such as the cloudy bag model  @xcite , one could obtain two poles close to the nominal @xmath2 resonance .",
    "also , in the investigation of the poles of the scattering matrix within the context of chiral dynamics  @xcite , it was found that there were two poles close to the nominal @xmath2 resonance both contributing to the @xmath3 invariant mass distribution .",
    "this was also the case in other works  @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath0 lies below the threshold of @xmath4 , the investigation of the @xmath0 structure is important also in view of low energy dynamics of anti - kaon and nucleon .",
    "the @xmath0 resonance is described here as a dynamically generated object in coupled - channel meson - baryon scattering with @xmath5 and @xmath6 within the chiral unitary approach  @xcite .",
    "we start with the scattering amplitude of the lowest order of the chiral perturbation theory , which is the weinberg - tomozawa term in case of the @xmath7 wave resonance .",
    "respecting the flavor su(3 ) symmetry , we consider all of the octet mesons ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) and the octet baryons ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) in the scattering channels .",
    "the unitary condition is imposed by summing up a series of relevant diagrams non - perturbatively . at this stage",
    ", the regularization of the loop integral brings parameters , which are the subtraction constants in the dispersion relation of the n / d method . in the present work ,",
    "the parameters are fitted so as to reproduce the threshold branching rations of @xmath1 to @xmath3 and @xmath15 channels .",
    "consequently , we obtain good agreements in the total cross sections of the @xmath1 scatterings to several channels  @xcite .",
    "for instance , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kpscatt ] , the total cross section of the @xmath1 elastic scattering is reproduced well in a wide region of the @xmath16 momenta .",
    "the details of the model are given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the good advantage of our approach is to obtain an analytic solution of the scattering equation under a low energy approximation in which one takes only the @xmath7-channel unitarity and limits the model space of the unitary integral to one meson and one baryon states  @xcite . exploiting this advantage , we search resonance poles for the scattering amplitudes with @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the second riemann sheet , which are summarized in table  [ tab : jido0 ] together with the coupling strengths of the resonances to the meson - baryon states as the residues of the amplitude at the pole position .",
    "we see that there are two poles around the @xmath0 energies below the threshold of the @xmath4 channel .",
    "the two poles are located so closely that the corresponding resonances do not separately appear on the real axis .",
    "therefore , what is seen in the mass spectrum around the @xmath0 energies is a superposition of these two states , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : massdist ] as the dotted line .",
    "another interesting point is that the resonances show different coupling strengths : the lower resonance strongly couples to the @xmath3 state , while the higher pole dominantly couples to the @xmath4 state .",
    "this is very important in investigating the structure of the @xmath0 resonance in experiment .",
    ".pole positions and couplings to @xmath6 physical states from ref .",
    "[ tab : jido0 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the existence of the two poles is strongly related to the flavor symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the underlying su(3 ) structure of the chiral lagrangians implies that a singlet and two octets of dynamically generated resonances should appear , to which the @xmath17 and the @xmath18 would belong  @xcite , and that the two octets get degenerate in exact su(3 ) symmetric case . in the physical limit , the su(3 )",
    "breaking resolves the degeneracy of the octets , and , as a consequence , one of them appears quite close to the singlet around the @xmath0 energies .",
    "the double pole structure of @xmath0 found here should be confirmed by new experiments .",
    "the idea to observe evidence of the double pole structure is to see the channel dependence of the @xmath0 mass spectrum . in case of having two poles close to each other with different coupling strengths to the meson baryon states , as in the present case ,",
    "the resonant shape should depend on the production channels , since both poles contribute to the mass spectrum with weights having the different channel dependences  @xcite .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : massdist ] , in which we show the @xmath3 mass distributions with @xmath6 initiated by the @xmath3 ( dotted line ) and @xmath4 ( solid line ) channels . thanks to the large weight of the second pole lying at higher energy with narrower width , the @xmath19 channel shows a quite different spectrum from the original one observed in the @xmath20 channel .",
    "one problem here is that one can not access the second pole directly from the @xmath4 channel , since the resonances lie below the threshold of the @xmath4 state .",
    "this leads us to consider indirect reactions for the @xmath0 production initiated by @xmath4 .",
    "one possible candidate of the indirect reaction is the @xmath21 reaction  @xcite , in which the @xmath16 loses some energy by emitting a photon before the creation of the resonances .",
    "another possibility is a photo - induced @xmath22 production , @xmath23 , provided in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this reaction",
    ", @xmath16 can be dominated at low energy in the @xmath24-channel exchange by use of a linearly polarized photon and detection of angular dependence of the final pion and kaon .",
    "it has been found that this process is suitable to isolate the second resonance .",
    "if one could confirm the double pole structure , it would be one of the strong indications that the @xmath0 structure is largely dominated by a quasibound meson - baryon component .",
    "finally let us briefly comment on model dependence of the double pole structure .",
    "it has been recently pointed out by updated analyses of low - energy @xmath16-proton interactions  @xcite that there is inconsistency between the elastic @xmath1 total cross section and the new dear measurements for the energy shift and width of kaonic hydrogen . in the later work",
    "@xcite , on discussion of the @xmath0 mass spectrum , they have used the next - to - leading order chiral lagrangian in a coupled channel approach with parameters fitted paying strong attention to the dear measurements .",
    "since the dear data suggests a smaller imaginary part of the @xmath1 scattering length , their fit with the dear data underestimates the total cross section of the elastic @xmath1 scattering and , consequently , the double pole structure is not so clearly seen .",
    "our analysis , on the other hand , is supported by the perfect reproduction of the @xmath25 total cross section , as well as the other works which obtain two poles around the @xmath0 energies .",
    "thus , precise measurements of the elastic @xmath1 scattering at low energies are very important also to understand the @xmath0 structure .",
    "the present investigation of the meson - baryon scattering within the chiral unitary approach suggests that two resonances are dynamically generated around energies of the nominal @xmath0 , as well as reproducing well the cross sections of the @xmath1 to the various channels .",
    "since the two resonances are located very close to each other , what one sees in experiments is a superposition of these two states .",
    "the existence of the two poles can be found out by performing different experiments of the @xmath0 creation initiated by the @xmath26 state .",
    "new measurements of the elastic @xmath1 scattering around threshold energies also would figure out the structure of @xmath0 .",
