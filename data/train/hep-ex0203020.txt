    "during its last three years of running ( 19982000 ) , the aleph detector at lep collected data from @xmath2 collisions at centre - of - mass energies between 189 and 209gev , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 628@xmath3 ( table  1 ) . in this letter , a search is performed on these data for the pair production of charginos , @xmath4 , in the framework of supersymmetric models with @xmath5-parity conservation and with the lightest neutralino @xmath6 as the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) . in particular , the configuration in which the mass difference @xmath7 between the charginos and the lsp is less than 5gev/@xmath1 is studied .",
    "the small-@xmath7 configuration is possible in the mssm , the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model @xcite , although it requires unusual assumptions to be made for the gaugino mass terms , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . indeed , with the usual gaugino - mass unification relation , charginos and neutralinos are nearly mass degenerate only in the deep higgsino region , _",
    "i.e. _ , for very large @xmath9 values",
    ". however , it happens for more natural values of the mssm parameters if the gaugino - mass unification assumption is relaxed .",
    "it even becomes common in models with anomaly - mediated supersymmetry breaking @xcite , in which @xmath8 is naturally much larger than @xmath9 .",
    "charginos generally decay into the stable lsp and a pair of fermions ( @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) . in the small-@xmath7 configuration",
    ", three different final state topologies may occur according to the value of @xmath7 .",
    "1 .   the mass difference , and therefore the phase space available for the chargino decay , is so small that charginos are long - lived .",
    "a search for heavy stable charged particles  @xcite is efficient for this topology .",
    "the mass difference is sufficiently large for the chargino decay products to trigger the data acquisition . in this case , the final state is characterized by the large amount of missing energy carried by the invisible lsps , as searched for in refs .",
    "the mass difference is in between , _",
    "i.e. _ , large enough for the charginos to decay before leaving the detector , but too small for the decay products to trigger the data acquisition .",
    "the last , intermediate , situation is analysed in this letter . as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , a search for radiative chargino pair production , @xmath12 , was performed , where the initial state radiation ( isr ) photon is emitted at sufficiently large angle with respect to the incoming beam to be detected , and with sufficiently large energy to activate the trigger system .",
    "the relevant topology is therefore an energetic , isolated photon accompanied by a few low - momentum particles from the chargino decays and large missing energy carried by the two neutralinos .",
    "this topology has also been searched for by other lep collaborations  @xcite with lower energy data .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "the aleph detector elements directly related to the isr photon search are described , followed by a summary of the signal and background simulation in section  3 .",
    "the event selection developed for the isr photon final state is explained in section  4 , the results are presented in section  5 , and their interpretation in the mssm , combined with those of the other two topological searches mentioned above , is given in section  6 .",

    "in order to provide complete coverage of all possible chargino decay lengths , the results of the present analysis , hereafter called _ the isr analysis _ , were combined with those of the search for heavy stable charged particles  @xcite , needed for very small @xmath13 values , and the standard missing - energy search  @xcite , efficient for @xmath14gev/@xmath1 .",
    "no background subtraction was performed and systematic uncertainties were taken into account according to ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the mssm , and in the absence of the assumption of gaugino - mass unification ,",
    "four parameters are to be considered in the gaugino sector : the soft - breaking gaugino mass terms , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; the higgs mixing term , @xmath15 ; and the ratio of the two higgs - doublet vacuum expectation values , @xmath16 . to determine 95% confidence level ( c.l .",

    "the regime in which all sfermion masses are very large is considered first . in this case",
    ", the chargino production cross section depends only on the four above - mentioned parameters , and charginos generically decay via @xmath22 .    in the gaugino region ( @xmath23 ) , it is possible to fine - tune @xmath16 to make the @xmath24 coupling vanish , in which case the chargino decay length increases substantially , even for large @xmath7 values . as a result ,",
    "the isr analysis is efficient independently of @xmath16 only over a limited range of @xmath7 , the extent of which depends on the @xmath25 couplings .",
    "this effect was quantitatively investigated under the assumption of a universal sfermion mass term @xmath26 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath27 of the chargino decay length is shown for @xmath28 in fig .",
    "[ lifetime]a , for @xmath29 and for various @xmath7 values .",
    "the exclusion domain in the ( @xmath30 ) plane derived at @xmath31 and fixed @xmath32 ( which corresponds to the maximum decay length for a chargino mass of @xmath33 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ lifetime]b ; the isr analysis covers the gap between the standard missing energy search and the stable particle analysis .",
    "results independent of @xmath27 are also shown in fig .",
    "[ isrgaug ] for @xmath34 .",
    "the standard missing energy search excludes @xmath7 values larger than @xmath35gev/@xmath1 , and the isr analysis @xmath7 values down to 1  to  1.5gev/@xmath1 .",
    "the search for heavy stable charged particles is fully efficient in a parameter - independent way only for @xmath36 , but a combination with the isr analysis allows the exclusion of the intermediate @xmath7 range to be achieved , independently of @xmath16 . in the end , a 95%  c.l .",
    "lower limit on the chargino mass of 88gev/@xmath1 is set in the gaugino region for heavy sfermions ( _ i.e. , _ for sfermion masses , or @xmath26 , larger than a few hundred gev/@xmath1 ) .    in the higgsino region ( @xmath37 ) , the chargino production cross section is smaller than in the gaugino region , but this effect is compensated by a generically larger chargino decay length , together with a reduced influence of @xmath16 . as a result ,",
    "the isr analysis on its own excludes a region larger than in the former case , namely @xmath7 between 150mev/@xmath1 and 3gev/@xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ isrhiggs ] ) , with only a slight dependence on @xmath26 .",
    "the combination of the three analyses allows a lower limit on the chargino mass to be set at 88gev/@xmath1 in the higgsino region .",
    "it was checked with a scan on the @xmath15 parameter that the 88gev/@xmath1 mass limit , obtained in the gaugino and higgsino regions , is generally valid for large sfermion masses .    for small enough sfermion ( most importantly slepton ) masses ,",
    "the chargino lifetime can be substantially reduced , even for very small @xmath7 values . as a result",
    ", the search for heavy stable particles loses efficiency for some parameter configurations as soon as @xmath38 , while the isr analysis is inefficient for such small @xmath7 values .",
    "therefore , the only completely general chargino mass limit is @xmath39 , as derived from the z width measurement at lep1  @xcite .    in a more constrained version of the mssm , namely with gaugino- and sfermion - mass unification ,",
    "charginos degenerate in mass with the lightest neutralino are only possible in the deep higgsino region . for such large @xmath9 values ,",
    "all sfermions are heavy .",
    "an absolute chargino mass lower limit of 88gev/@xmath1 therefore holds within this framework .",
    "a search for charginos nearly mass degenerate with the lightest neutralino has been performed using data collected by the aleph detector at lep at centre - of - mass energies between 189 and 209gev .",
    "no excess of candidate events with respect to standard model background predictions was found .",
    "the results have been interpreted in terms of exclusion limits in the framework of the mssm ; in the heavy sfermion scenario the absolute 95%  c.l .",
    "chargino mass lower limit is @xmath40 for any @xmath27 , irrespective of the chargino field content .    in the light sfermion scenario ,",
    "no @xmath41-independent limit on the chargino mass is set from direct searches .",
    "chargino masses up to @xmath42 are excluded , indirectly , from the measurement of the z total width at lep1 .",
