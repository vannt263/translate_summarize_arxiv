    "[ [ section ] ]    consider a family @xmath8 over the open disk , satisfying a suitable condition of local triviality over @xmath9 . in  @xcite ,",
    "verdier defines a ` specialization morphism ' for constructible functions , producing a function @xmath10 on the central fiber  @xmath3 of the family for every constructible function @xmath11 on @xmath5 .",
    "the key property of this specialization morphism is that it commutes with the construction of chern classes of constructible functions in the sense of macpherson ( @xcite ) ; cf .  theorem  5.1 in verdier s note .",
    "the specialization morphism for constructible functions is induced from a morphism at the level of constructible sheaves @xmath12 , by taking alternating sums of ranks for the corresponding complex of nearby cycles @xmath13 .",
    "the main purpose of this note is to give a more direct description of the specialization morphism ( in the algebraic category , over algebraically closed fields of characteristic  @xmath14 ) , purely in terms of constructible functions and of resolution of singularities , including an elementary proof of the basic compatibility relation with chern classes .",
    "we will assume that @xmath5 is nonsingular away from @xmath3 , and focus on the case of the specialization of constant functions ; by linearity and functoriality properties , this suffices in order to determine @xmath15 in the situation considered by verdier .",
    "on the other hand , the situation we consider is more general than the specialization template recalled above : we define a constructible function @xmath2 for _ every _ proper closed subscheme @xmath3 of a variety @xmath5 ( such that @xmath1 is nonsingular ) , which agrees with verdier s specialization of the constant function @xmath4 when @xmath3 is the fiber of a morphism from @xmath5 to a nonsingular curve .",
    "the definition of @xmath2 ( definition  [ maindef ] ) is straightforward , and can be summarized as follows .",
    "let @xmath16 be a proper birational morphism such that @xmath17 is nonsingular , and @xmath18 is a divisor with normal crossings and nonsingular components , and for which @xmath19 is an isomorphism .",
    "then define @xmath20 to be @xmath21 if @xmath22 is on a single component of @xmath23 of multiplicity  @xmath21 , and @xmath14 otherwise ; and let @xmath2 be the push - forward of @xmath24 to @xmath3 .",
    "readers who are familiar with verdier s paper @xcite should recognize that this construction is implicit in  5 of that paper , if @xmath3 is the zero - locus of a function on @xmath5 .",
    "our contribution is limited to the realization that the weak factorization theorem of @xcite may be used to adopt this prescription as a _ definition , _ that the properties of this function follow directly from the standard apparatus of intersection theory , and that this approach extends the theory beyond the specialization situation considered by verdier ( at least in the algebraic case ) .",
    "denoting by @xmath25 the chern - schwartz - macpherson class of a constructible function , we prove the following :    * theorem i. * let @xmath26 be an effective cartier divisor . then @xmath27    an expression for @xmath28 in terms of the basic ingredients needed to define @xmath2 as above may be given as soon as @xmath29 is a regular embedding ( cf .  remark  [ regemb ] ) .",
    "in fact , with suitable positions , theorem  i holds for arbitrary closed embeddings @xmath0 ( theorem  [ spethm ] ) .",
    "theorem  i reproduces verdier s result when @xmath3 is a fiber of a morphism from @xmath5 to a nonsingular curve ; in that case ( but not in general ) @xmath30 may be replaced with @xmath4 , as in verdier s note .",
    "the definition of @xmath2 is clearly compatible with smooth maps , and in particular the value of @xmath2 at a point @xmath22 may be computed after restricting to an open neighborhood of @xmath22 .",
    "thus , verdier s formula for the specialization function in terms of the euler characteristic of the intersection of a nearby fiber with a ball (  4 in @xcite ) may be used to compute @xmath2 if @xmath3 is a divisor in @xmath5 , over @xmath31 .    from the definition",
    "it is clear that the function @xmath2 is birationally invariant in the following weak sense :    * theorem ii . *",
    "let @xmath32 be a proper birational morphism ; let @xmath33 , and assume that @xmath34 restricts to an isomorphism @xmath35 . then @xmath36    ( here , @xmath37 is the push - forward of constructible functions . )    in fact , the whole specialization _",
    "morphism _ commutes with arbitrary proper maps , at least in verdier s specialization situation ( @xcite , corollary  3.6 )",
    ". it would be desirable to establish this fact for the morphism induced by @xmath2 for arbitrary @xmath3 , by the methods used in this paper .    the definition summarized above yields a natural decomposition of the constructible function @xmath38 ( and hence of its chern class @xmath28 ) according to the multiplicities of some of the exceptional divisors ,",
    "see remarks  [ distdecfun ] and  [ distdeccla ] . in the specialization situation",
    ", this decomposition matches the one induced on the milnor fiber by monodromy , as follows from the description of the latter in @xcite .",
    "as schrmann pointed out to me , an analogous description in the more general case considered here may be found in @xcite , theorem  3.2 .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    in the basic specialization situation , in which @xmath3 is the zero - scheme of a function @xmath39 on  @xmath5 and @xmath5 is nonsingular , let @xmath40 be the _ singularity subscheme _ of @xmath3 ( i.e. , the ` critical scheme ' of  @xmath39 ) .",
    "one can define a constructible function @xmath41 on @xmath3 by @xmath42 in this case ( and over @xmath31 ) , the function @xmath2 agrees with verdier s specialization function  @xmath43 ( here we use notation as in @xcite , cf .",
    "especially proposition  5.1 ) .",
    "the function @xmath41 is @xmath14 outside of @xmath40 , so may be viewed as a constructible function on  @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , it has been observed ( cf .",
    "e.g. ,  @xcite ) that the function @xmath41 is a specific linear combination of local euler obstructions , and in particular it is determined by the scheme @xmath40 and can be generalized to arbitrary schemes .",
    "kai behrend denotes this generalization @xmath44 in @xcite .",
    "the definition of @xmath2 given in this paper yields an alternative computation of @xmath41 when  @xmath40  is the critical scheme of a function , and theorem  ii describes the behavior through modifications along @xmath3 of this function : if @xmath32 is as in theorem  ii , then @xmath45 provided that @xmath5 and @xmath46 are nonsingular , @xmath3 and hence @xmath33 are hypersurfaces , and @xmath40 , @xmath47 are their singularity subschemes .",
    "as @xmath2 is defined for arbitrary @xmath0 , there may be a generalization of ( * ) linking behrend s function and @xmath48 when @xmath3 is not necessarily a hypersurface ; it would be interesting to have statements analogous to ( * * ) , holding for more general @xmath3 .",
    "in  [ wmather ] we comment on the relation between @xmath7 and the ` weighted chern - mather class ' of the singularity subscheme @xmath40 of a hypersurface @xmath3 ; the degree of this class is a donaldson - thomas type invariant ( @xcite ,  4.3 ) .",
    "we also provide an explicit formula for the function @xmath41 in terms of a resolution of the hypersurface @xmath3",
    ". it would be interesting to extend these results to the non - hypersurface case .    in a different vein",
    ", j.  schrmann has considered the iteration of the specialization operator over a set of generators for a complete intersection @xmath0 ( @xcite , definition  3.6 ) .",
    "it would be a natural project to compare schrmann s definition ( which depends on the order of the generators ) with our definition of @xmath2 ( which is independent of the order , and may be extended to arbitrary @xmath0 ) .",
    "schrmann also points out that the _ deformation to the normal cone _ may be used to reduce an arbitrary @xmath0 to a specialization situation ; this strategy was introduced in @xcite , and is explained in detail in  @xcite ,  1 .",
    "again , it would be interesting to establish the precise relation between the resulting specialization morphism and the function @xmath2 studied here .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    we include in  [ mot ] a brief discussion of a ` motivic ' invariant @xmath6 , also defined for any closed embedding @xmath0 into a variety , still assumed for simplicity to be nonsingular outside of  @xmath3 .",
    "this invariant can be defined in the quotient of the grothendieck ring of varieties by the ideal generated by the class of a torus @xmath49 , or in a more refined relative ring over @xmath3 .",
    "the definition is again extremely simple , when given in terms of a resolution in which the inverse image of @xmath3 is a divisor with normal crossings ; the proof that the invariant is well - defined also follows from the weak factorization theorem .",
    "as its constructible function counterpart , the class @xmath6 admits a natural ` monodromy ' decomposition ( although a milnor fiber is not defined in general in the situation we consider ) , see remark  [ distdecmot ] .",
    "when @xmath5 is nonsingular and @xmath3 is the zero - locus of a function on  @xmath5 , @xmath6 is a poor man s version of the denef - loeser motivic milnor / nearby fiber ( @xcite , 3.5 ) ; it is defined in a much coarser ring , but it carries information concerning the topological euler characteristic and some other hodge - type data .",
    "we note that @xmath6 is _ not _ the image of the limit of the _ naive _ motivic zeta function of denef - loeser , since it does carry multiplicity information , while @xmath50 discards it ( see for example @xcite , corollary  3.3 ) .",
    "the limit of the ( non - naive ) denef - loeser motivic zeta function @xmath51 encodes the multiplicity and much more as actual monodromy information , and in this sense it lifts the information carried by our  @xmath6 .",
    "it would be interesting to define and study an analogous lift for more general closed embeddings @xmath0 , and possibly allowing @xmath5 to be singular along  @xmath3 .",
    "the approach of @xcite could be used to unify the constructions of @xmath2 and @xmath6 given in this paper , and likely extend them to other environments , but we will not pursue such generalizations here since our aim is to keep the discussion at the simplest possible level . likewise , ` celestial ' incarnations of the milnor fiber ( in the spirit of @xcite , @xcite ) will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    in our view , the main advantages of the approach taken in this paper are the simplicity afforded by the use of the weak factorization theorem and the fact that the results have a straightforward interpretation for any closed embedding @xmath0 , whether arising from a specialization situation or not .",
    "these results hold with identical proofs over any algebraically closed field of characteristic zero .",
    "we note that the paper @xcite of van proeyen and veys also deals with arbitrary closed embeddings with nonsingular complements , as in this note .",
    "a treatment of verdier specialization over arbitrary algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero , also using only the standard apparatus of intersection theory , was given by kennedy in @xcite by relying on the lagrangian viewpoint introduced by c.  sabbah @xcite .",
    "fu ( @xcite ) gives a description of verdier s specialization in terms of normal currents .",
    "we were motivated to take a new look at verdier s specialization because of applications to string - theoretic identities ( cf .",
    "@xcite ,  4 ) .",
    "also , verdier specialization offers an alternative approach to the main result of @xcite .",
    "the main reason to allow @xmath5 to have singularities along @xmath3 is that this typically is the case for specializations arising from pencils of hypersurfaces in a linear system , as in these applications .",
    "see   [ pencils ] for a few simpler examples illustrating this point .",
    "[ [ section-4 ] ]    i am indebted to m.  marcolli for helpful conversations , and i thank j. schrmann and w.  veys for comments on a previous version of this paper .",
    "our schemes are separated , of finite type over an algebraically closed field  @xmath52 of characteristic  @xmath14 .",
    "the characteristic restriction is due to the use of resolution of singularities and the main result of @xcite , as well as the theory of chern - schwartz - macpherson classes .",

    "now there are two kinds of points @xmath90 : either @xmath81 is in exactly one component @xmath55 , or it is in the intersection of several components . in the first case , @xmath86 is the unique component of @xmath93 other than @xmath87 meeting the fiber @xmath94 of @xmath87 over @xmath81 . by definition ,",

    "it is however interesting that the geometry of the resolution _ is _ affected by the base locus of the pencil : the total space of the specialization is smooth near @xmath22 if the cusp is not in the base locus ( as in  [ sincurves ] ) , while it is singular if the cusp is in the base locus ( as in this subsection ) .",
    "any difference in the normal crossing resolution due to these features must compensate and produce the same value for  @xmath198 .",
