    "our n - body results are consistent with the high resolution simulations of @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the variation of @xmath177 with @xmath194 plays an important role in redshift space distortions .",

    "the problem is that all the models predict different values for @xmath50 , and the predicted values are too large .",
    "model a which has the highest value of @xmath50 fares the worst with the predicted @xmath192 and @xmath193 being much larger than the n - body results .",
    "the predictions of models b , c and d are slightly closer to the n - body results , but they are all still very significantly higher than the n - body results . in summary @xmath192 and @xmath193 predicted by all the models are significantly in excess of the values determined directly from n - body simulations .",
    "this indicates that there is a gap in our understanding of what is really going on .",
    "the possibility of using the pairwise velocity dispersion as a tool for distinguishing between different cosmological models has been controversial and this has been hotly debated in the literature ( eg .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "an important fact that we should remember while measuring the pairwise velocity dispersion from n - body simulations is that it is a pair weighted statistic and is heavily weighted by the densest regions present in the sample .",
    "these regions naturally have the highest velocity dispersion and this tends to push up the estimate .",
    "the statistic is strongly dependent on the presence or absence of rich clusters within the sample ( eg .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it has also been confirmed by several authors ( eg .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) that the velocity field is very cold outside the clusters .",
    "we note that these effects are not very crucial in our work .",
    "this is because we have used exactly the same set of particles drawn from our n - body simulations to determine both @xmath49 and @xmath169 , and we have been testing if the models which make reasonably good predictions for @xmath49 are also successful in correctly predicting @xmath169 .",
    "we would expect this to be true because the peculiar velocities which are quantified by the pairwise velocity dispersion are also the cause of the redshift space distortions .",
    "surprisingly , we find that the model predictions for @xmath169 are significantly in excess of @xmath169 determined directly from the simulations .",
    "the galaxy two - point correlation function determined from redshift surveys shows significant deviations from the predictions of the linear theory of redshift space distortion even on scales as large as @xmath201 where linear theory is expected to be valid on real space .",
    "any attempt to determine @xmath1 from redshift surveys requires that these deviations be properly modeled and taken into account .",
    "modeling redshift space distortions basically requires a joint model for galaxy peculiar velocities and their correlations with the galaxy clustering pattern .",
    "such models test our understanding of the gravitational instability process by which the large scale structures are believed to have formed .",
    "we have considered four different models ( details in section 2 ) for the redshift space two - point correlation function @xmath49 .",
    "all the models are based on the assumption that galaxy peculiar velocities may be decomposed into two parts , one arising from coherent flows and another from random motions .",
    "it is also assumed that in real space the coherent flows are well described by the linear theory of density perturbation .",
    "deviations from the predictions of the linear theory of redshift space distortion arise from two distinct causes which affect the mapping from real to redshift space ( a. ) non - linear effects due to the coherent flows ( b. ) the random motions . among the four models ,",
    "model a does not incorporate the non - linear effects due to the coherent flows .",
    "it combines the predictions of the linear theory of redshift space distortion ( @xcite , @xcite ) with the effect of the random motions which is modeled through an exponential distribution function for the pairwise velocity .",
    "this is the popular phenomenological model which has been widely applied to the analysis of galaxy redshift surveys ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) . models b , c and d all take into account non - linear effects arising from the coherent flows @xcite , and they differ from one another in the choice of the distribution function for the random part of the pairwise velocity .",
    "all the models have only one free parameter , @xmath50 which is the one dimensional random pairwise velocity dispersion . for each model",
    "we have determined the value of @xmath50 for which the model predictions best fit the quadrupole anisotropy of @xmath49 determined from n - body simulations .",
    "we find that model c gives the lowest value of the best fit @xmath151 over the range of length - scales @xmath202 where we expect linear theory to be valid in real space . in this model",
    "the distribution function for the random part of a galaxy s peculiar velocity is modeled as an exponential function .",
    "it may be noted that the other three models also give acceptable fits to the n - body results .",
    "we find that three of the models ( a , b and c ) also give acceptable fits over length - scales @xmath203 which includes a small region where perturbations are expected to be mildly non - linear .",
    "model d where the distribution function @xmath88 for the random part of pairwise velocity is a gaussian fails to give an acceptable fit .",
    "model b where @xmath88 is an exponential gives the lowest value of best fit @xmath151 .",
    "it may be noted that though the best fit value of @xmath151 for model a , the commonly used phenomenological model , is around three times larger than that for model b , it is not possible to draw a strong statistical conclusion as to which model is superior .",
    "this is because @xmath204 for models a , b and c and they all provide acceptable fits .",
    "the present work is limited by the large statistical error - bars in the quantities determined at large scales from n - body simulations .",
    "these errors arise from the limited volume of the simulations ( cosmic variance ) .",
    "it should be possible to achieve lower @xmath205 error - bars using larger simulations whereby we could distinguish between these models at a higher level of statistical significance .",
    "we propose to carry this out in the future .",
    "interestingly , the best fit value of @xmath50 shows substantial variations across the models .",
    "the best fit value of @xmath50 is substantially smaller in the models which incorporate the non - linear effects of the coherent flows ( b , c and d ) as compared to model a which does not include these effects .",
    "this indicates that there are significant nonlinear effects in the mapping from real to redshift space arising from the coherent flows .",
    "the commonly used phenomenological model does not incorporate these effects and in this model all deviations from the linear predictions are attributed to random motions .",
    "this leads to the pairwise velocity dispersion of the random motion ( @xmath50 ) being overestimated . for eaxample ,",
    "@xcite have used model a to fit the redshift space two - point correlation function of the 2dfgrs to obtain the best fit value @xmath206 .",
    "the findings of this paper show that models b and c would be equally successful in fitting the same observation , and the best fit value of @xmath50 would be different for each of these models .",
    "this raises questions as to the interpretation of @xmath50 determined by this method .",
    "although the models are all reasonably successful in fitting the quadrupole anisotropies of @xmath49 , the model predictions for the pairwise velocity dispersion are much larger than the values determined directly from n - body simulations .",
    "surprisingly , the predictions of linear theory which has a contribution from only the coherent flows and not the random motions are much closer to the n - body results as compared to the model predictions . at large scales the predictions of linear theory , all the models and the n - body results are all very similar .",
    "the linear theory predictions are slightly below the n - body results , and one would expect that it would be possible to recover the n - body results by combining the linear theory predictions with the contribution from random motions .",
    "unfortunately , all the models appear to be overestimating the contribution from random motions and the model predictions are significantly in excess of the n - body results .",
    "also , the predictions of model a fare the worst in comparison to the other models .",
    "a possible explanation why equations ( [ eq : c3 ] ) and ( [ eq : c4 ] ) overpredicts the pairwise velocity dispersion is that the linear component of the peculiar velocity also makes a contribution to the random motions .",
    "it is possible that this is already present in @xmath50 , and it contributes more than its due share to the pairwise velocity dispersion .    in the linear theory of redshift space distortions",
    "the hexadecapole anisotropy arises from the line of sight component of the pairwise velocity dispersion .",
    "the fact that none of the four models considered here give a very good fit to the hexadecapole is probably related to the fact that the models also do not predict the correct pairwise velocity dispersion .",
    "we note that the assumption that galaxy peculiar velocities can be decomposed into two parts , one coherent and another random is consistent with the halo model . the random part may be attributed to motions inside the halo and the coherent part to the overall motion of the halo .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite have calculated the galaxy power spectrum in redshift space using the halo model . @xcite",
    "have calculated the pairwise velocity dispersion using the halo model .",
    "in conclusion we note that the nonlinear effects in the mapping from real to redshift space introduced by the coherent flows are important .",
    "models which incorporate these effects provide an equally good to the quadrupole anisotropies of @xmath49 as compared to models which are based on the linear theory of redshift distortion . unfortunately",
    ", none of these models make correct predictions for the pairwise velocity dispersion .",
