    "the long relaxation times seen in supercooled liquids have long been a challenge to understand @xcite .",
    "glassy behavior has been extensively modelled by studying hard spheres in three dimensions and hard disks in two dimensions .",
    "some of this work is reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we study small systems of disks , in particular two disks and five disks confined in a square , first using event driven molecular dynamics and then by means of transition state theory @xcite . in the final section of the paper we use the insights gained from studying small systems to speculate about the behavior of large numbers of hard spheres or disks .",
    "it is convenient from the outset to introduce the following terminology .",
    "the transition state is the neck in configuration space through which the system has to pass to escape its initial state .",
    "a _ configuration _ of the @xmath2 disks is defined by the @xmath3 coordinates of the disk centers ( for disks , @xmath4 ) ; every configuration belongs to a _ state _ , which is the set of configurations that can be reached from it without violating the no - overlap constraint appropriate for hard disks and spheres",
    ". the transition state theory will be found to work well when the neck is narrow , that is , when there are long relaxation times in the system .",
    "we shall illustrate the process of escape from the initial configuration for two simple systems , consisting of either two or five disks confined in a square .",
    "for these simple systems we can make explicit the narrow necks in configuration space through which the system can escape from its initial configuration near an inherent state  @xcite .",
    "we shall show that transition state theory provides a quantitative account of the slow relaxational processes in these small systems .",
    "the theory requires that one evaluates a variant of the partition function of the system at the neck ( @xmath1 ) and to do this we adopt the procedure first used by salsburg and wood @xcite to calculate the pressure of hard spheres near their largest packing density .",
    "we have checked its accuracy for these small systems by comparing its predictions for the pressure of the system and the relaxation times with results obtained directly from event driven molecular dynamics .    of course , one is only interested in small systems of disks because of the light their study might shine on large systems of hard disks or spheres .",
    "we shall show that as @xmath2 , the number of disks or spheres , becomes large , then , under certain circumstances , our transition state formula for the relaxation time in the system goes over to the well - known vogel  fulcher  tammann ( vft ) equation .",
    "these circumstances are evidently realized in at least one case , that of disks moving in a narrow channel @xcite .",
    "the agreement is quantitative in this case @xcite . for hard spheres in three dimensions their alpha relaxation time",

    "it may be noticed that @xmath40 differs significantly from the value 0.1871 stated by carlsson et al .",
    "we have been unable to find a path between glass - like and crystal - like metastable states that passes via the configuration proposed in their paper .",

    "such a reaction path is illustrated by an animation provided in the supplement to this paper  @xcite .",
    "as for the case of two disks , an event - driven molecular dynamics algorithm @xcite was used to simulate the motion of the five - disk system and calculate the mean time of passage between metastable states .",

    "[ critical ]  ( b ) , we can see that a transition has occurred if a disk [ e.g. the shaded disk in fig .",

    "the time of first occurrence of the diagnostic event is recorded and the simulation restarted with random initial velocities .",
    "transition state theory requires us to evaluate @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "we shall use the procedure introduced by salsburg and wood @xcite to determine these as it becomes essentially exact as the density approaches its maximum value ( called @xmath46 ) appropriate for a given inherent state .",

    "similarly , as @xmath54 from below , @xmath55 where @xmath56 . hence , according to transition state theory , the transition rate @xmath19 from the crystal to the glass state should vary as @xmath57 if the reaction coordinate is fixed at the value it takes in the transition state , the hard - disk constraints define a configuration space with nine spatial dimensions in our two - dimensional hard disk system .",
    "accordingly , the constrained partition function should be expected to vary as @xmath58 using the procedure of salsburg and wood @xcite .",

    "notice that at the neck , @xmath64 , which is indicated by the vertical dashed line in fig .",
    "[ pressure ] , the singularities are so mild as to be invisible , which means it is adequate to use in eq .  ( [ tsprediction ] ) the form of @xmath0 valid near @xmath46 , even for @xmath7 close to @xmath30 .",
    "( also , the expression for @xmath18 is dominated by the form of @xmath1 , which is rapidly approaching zero as @xmath54 , while @xmath0 is there only slowly varying . )",
    "in our studies of two and five disks we found that a transition between states in a region containing @xmath2 particles generally requires coordinated motion of all the @xmath2 particles in order to squeeze through the neck in the phase space . the rate at which this will occur was given by the transition state formula of eq .",
    "( [ tsprediction ] ) . in this section ,",
    "we examine the consequences of assuming that the formula can be extended to systems containing a large number @xmath2 of spheres or disks .",
    "we shall first suppose that one is at a packing fraction below that of the neck out of an inherent state whose largest density is at a packing fraction @xmath46 and that @xmath30 is the highest packing fraction below @xmath46 at which a neck first opens to allow escape from the inherent state , and that one is in a configuration close to that of the inherent state .",
    "furthermore we shall assume that when @xmath2 is large , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a positive constant of o(1 ) .",
    "the assumption behind eq .",

    "given a particular configuration of the @xmath2 particles with a packing fraction @xmath7 we need to know the packing fraction @xmath46 of the nearby inherent state close to the initial configuration . in other words ,",
    "we need the stillinger map to the jammed inherent states @xcite . for the problem of disks moving in a long narrow channel such a map",
    "was explicitly constructed in @xcite and the function @xmath71 exhibited . except for quite small values of @xmath7",
    ", @xmath71 is essentially a constant independent of @xmath7 and close to the largest packing fraction possible in the system .",
    "the map is similar to what would have been obtained in an extremely rapid compression .",
    "the relaxation times @xmath18 in this narrow channel system are consistent with eq .",
    "( [ vft ] ) @xcite .",
    "it has proved possible to identify the inherent states and the necks which have to be squeezed through to escape from the vicinity of the inherent states and as a consequence the value of the coefficient @xmath66 can be explicitly determined for this system @xcite .    in dimensions",
    "@xmath72 much less can be said with certainty .",
    "fits of the alpha relaxation time to the vft formula for three dimensional hard spheres were made by brambilla et al .",
    "@xcite and a fit was achieved with a value of @xmath73 .",
    "one might have expected that the appropriate value of @xmath46 if the map from @xmath7 to the inherent state is essentially a rapid compression would be that of random close packing , @xmath74 .",
    "the result that @xmath73 was obtained for studies of @xmath18 at @xmath75 and it might require data at larger values of @xmath7 to produce @xmath46 values closer to @xmath76 .",
    "we have been assuming that the stillinger map in two and three dimensions , @xmath71 , is essentially a constant independent of @xmath7 .",
    "this lack of any @xmath7 dependence of @xmath71 seems unlikely according to the studies in @xcite .",
    "suppose that instead the stillinger map in two and three dimensions takes the form , for @xmath7 close to @xmath76 , @xmath77 with @xmath78 . to test this supposition , one would need to start the rapid compression from the well - equilibrated fluid system at a packing fraction near @xmath76 .",
    "producing this initial state would be difficult .",

    "@xcite , a good fit was obtained with @xmath80 and a value for @xmath81  a commonly quoted value .    in words , eq .",
    "( [ phijphi ] ) states that if one starts from the equilibrated system at a packing fraction @xmath7 close to @xmath76 , then the rapid compression ( or the stillinger map ) finds a jammed state whose packing fraction @xmath46 only differs from @xmath7 by a quantity of order @xmath82 , which is small when @xmath83 .",
    "the physical implication is that equilibrated systems at such high densities are always close to a jammed state .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ phijphi ] )",
    "also assumes that @xmath76 is a well - defined density and this is contentious @xcite .",
    "notice that our difficulties in using eq .",
    "( [ vft ] ) stem from just not knowing the form of the stillinger map @xmath71 for two and three dimensional systems .",
    "it is possible that it takes a form that would leave @xmath84 finite for all @xmath7 less than that of the maximum density . in this situation",
    "it could be that for @xmath7 well below @xmath76 @xmath84 might appear to be diverging as @xmath85 , but if studies could be performed nearer @xmath76 the relaxation times would be very long but finite .",
    "in conclusion we have shown that the long relaxation times seen in small systems of two and five disks confined in a square are due to squeezing through necks in configuration space , and can be understood quantitatively with the aid of transition state theory .",
    "we have suggested that a similar mechanism might be relevant to hard spheres in higher dimensions and could lead either to the vft formula or possibly a generalization of it ."
