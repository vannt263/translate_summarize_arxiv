    "nonmagnetic rare - earth borocarbides , such as yni@xmath5b@xmath5c and luni@xmath5b@xmath5c , are among the materials which exhibit unconventional superconductivity .",
    "there is strong evidence in these materials indicating that their superconducting gap function is highly anisotropic  @xcite and that there exist low - lying excitations in the superconducting state  @xcite .",
    "the presence of these low energy excitations implies that the gap function has nodes ( or deep minima ) on the fermi surface .",
    "the location of these nodes and their nature , i.e. , whether they are point nodes or line nodes is still unclear .",
    "the thermal conductivity in a magnetic field at low temperatures  @xcite and the dependence of the specific heat on the magnetic field  @xcite suggest the existence of line nodes like those in the cuprates and upt@xmath6 .",
    "however , the recent measurements of the @xmath4-axis thermal conductivity in a rotational magnetic field along the @xmath2 plane were interpreted as evidence for a gap function with point nodes along [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] directions  @xcite .",
    "further studies which employ different experimental techniques may be necessary to determine the detailed structure of the superconducting gap function in momentum space . here",
    "we suggest that directional tunnelling spectroscopy may be useful for this purpose .",
    "in general , the tunnelling conductance spectrum of an anisotropic superconductor is strongly dependent on the crystal orientation with respect to the interface plane . in the case of a @xmath7-wave superconductor with vertical line nodes",
    ", it has been shown that features in the conductance spectrum occur at voltages which depend strongly on crystal orientation .",
    "these voltages correspond to values of the gap function at particular points on the fermi surface  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the case of an @xmath2 plane tunnelling junction , if the surface orientation of the superconductor is not [ 100 ] or [ 010 ] , the conductance spectrum contains a peak at the voltage corresponding to the value of the gap function in the direction parallel to the surface normal .",
    "the observation of this feature would , in principle , allow the directional normal metal - superconductor ( ns ) tunnelling spectroscopy to map out the magnitude of the superconducting gap function .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the ns tunnelling spectra of anisotropic @xmath0-wave superconductors with two forms of gap functions , which have been suggested as possible candidates for the gap in borocarbides  @xcite .",
    "the candidates are allowed by the symmetry of the borocarbide crystal structure and consistent with experimental results .",
    "it is apparent that the gap function has four - fold symmetry and does not change sign but there is evidence for deep minima along [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] directions  @xcite .",
    "the simplest suitable candidates are of the @xmath8-wave form . in our calculation",
    ", we find , similar to a @xmath7-wave case , that features appear in the spectra at voltages corresponding to values of the gap at particular points on the fermi surface depending on surface orientation .",
    "some of these features are characteristic of the general @xmath8-wave gap function and are thus common to both candidates , while one particular feature occurs only for the candidate with point nodes .",
    "thus , if these features can be observed experimentally , it may be possible to determine which form of the gap , if either , correctly describes that of the borocarbides .",
    "the two candidate gap functions are both @xmath8-wave and are given by equation  ( [ line - gap ] ) and ( [ point - gap ] ) respectively .",
    "@xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the polar angles in spherical coordinates , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the @xmath0 and @xmath1 components of the gap function respectively . for an elliptical fermi surface ,",
    "the case of line ( point ) nodes occurs when @xmath14 in equation  ( [ line - gap ] ) ( equation  ( [ point - gap ] ) ) .",
    "we study both @xmath2 plane and @xmath4-axis tunnelling spectra for both forms of the gap function by using the so - called blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( btk ) scattering formalism  @xcite and a continuous model to describe the electronic structure of the normal metal and superconductor .",
    "although detailed features of the conductance depend on the shape of the fermi surface , it is sufficient to use the continuous model which gives an elliptical fermi surface to study the positions of the main features in the conductance spectra  @xcite .    in the case of tunnelling into the @xmath2 plane of a @xmath8-wave superconductor ,",
    "we show in this paper that there are three main features occurring at voltages associated with the difference of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 component of the gap function and the values of the gap function in two particular directions with respect to the interface normal , one in the direction parallel to the surface normal and the other in the direction making a @xmath3 angle with the surface normal .",
    "these two features are more prominent for the @xmath8-wave superconductor with line nodes than for the superconductor with point nodes . in the case of @xmath4-axis tunnelling junctions",
    ", there is one prominent feature at the maximum gap in the conductance spectrum of the superconductor with line nodes , whereas for the superconductor with point nodes the conductance spectrum contains two features , one at the maximum gap and the other at the value of the gap function along the @xmath4 axis .    in section [ method ]",
    ", we describe the calculation method and the assumptions used throughout this paper .",
    "then , we provide the detailed results and discussion of all the cases of interest at zero temperature in section [ result ] .",
    "in addition to the cases in which the nodes exist , we also consider cases in which the superconducting gap has small but nonzero gap minima .",
    "we show all the results in both the andreev limit ( low barrier ) and the tunnelling limit ( high barrier ) .",
    "as in reference  @xcite , we represent the ns junction with an infinite system , the left half of which is a normal metal and the right half of which is a superconductor ( see figure  [ ns - geo ] ) . the insulating barrier is represented by a delta function potential with strength @xmath15 .",
    "the normal metal - superconductor ( ns ) junction is represented by an infinite system as shown in this picture .",
    "the normal metal fills the @xmath16 region and the superconductor fills the @xmath17 region .",
    "the insulator layer is represented by a delta function of height @xmath15 in units of energy per length .",
    "the gap function is taken to be zero in the normal metal and to be nonzero and independent of @xmath18 in the superconductor . ]    for the @xmath2 plane tunnelling junctions , the interface normal vector lies somewhere in the @xmath2 plane , and for the @xmath4-axis tunnelling junction the interface normal is parallel to the @xmath4 axis .",
    "we take the normal metal to be cubic , and take the superconductor to be tetragonal to describe the crystal structure of the borocarbides . in our calculation , we ignore both the suppression of the gap function near the ns interface and the proximity effect for simplicity . the gap function @xmath19 is taken to be as in either equation ( [ line - gap ] ) or ( [ point - gap ] ) .",
