    "the cosmological constant + cold dark matter ( @xmath2 ) model is the reigning paradigm of structure formation in the universe .",
    "the presence of large amounts of dark mass in the surroundings of galaxies and within galaxy clusters has been established firmly using dynamical mass estimates that include spiral galaxy rotation curves , velocity dispersions of galaxies in clusters and x - ray emission measurements of the hot gas in these systems , as well as strong and weak lensing of background galaxies .",
    "the @xmath2 model also correctly predicts the details of the temperature and polarization of the cosmic background radiation @xcite .",
    "a few issues remain where the model and the observations are either hard to reconcile or very difficult to compare @xcite .",
    "examples of this are the so - called missing satellites problem @xcite and the cusp / core nature of the central density profiles of dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "an outstanding challenge for the @xmath2 model that we address here is to reproduce the observed abundance of galaxies as a function of their overall properties such as dynamical mass , luminosity , stellar mass , and morphology , both nearby and at higher redshifts",
    ". a successful cosmological model should produce agreement with various observed galaxy dynamical scaling laws such as the faber - jackson @xcite and tully - fisher @xcite relations .",
    "making theoretical predictions for properties of galaxies that can be tested against observations is difficult .",
    "while dissipationless simulations can provide remarkably accurate predictions of various properties of dark matter halos , they do not yet make secure predictions about what we actually observe  the distribution and motions of stars and gas .",
    "we need to find a common ground where theoretical predictions can be confronted with observations . in this paper",
    "we use three statistics to compare theory and observations : ( a ) the luminosity - circular velocity ( lv ) relation , ( b ) the baryonic tully - fisher relation ( btf ) , and ( c ) the circular velocity function ( vf ) .    in all three cases we need to estimate the circular velocity ( a metric of dynamical mass ) at some distance from the center of each dark matter halo that hosts a visible galaxy .",
    "unfortunately , theory can not yet make accurate predictions for the central regions of galaxies because of uncertain baryonic astrophysics . as a compromise",
    ", we propose to use the distance of 10  kpc",
    ". measurements of rotational or circular velocities of galaxies either exist for this distance or can be approximated by extrapolations . at the same time",
    ", theoretical predictions at 10  kpc are also simplified because they avoid the complications of the central regions of galaxies .",
    "our lv relation is a close cousin of the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation and , indeed , we will use some observational results used to construct the traditional tully - fisher relation . however , there are substantial differences between the tf and the lv relations .",
    "the standard tully - fisher relation tells us how quickly spiral disks rotate for given luminosity .",
    "the rotation velocity is typically measured at 2.2 disk scale lengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the `` cold '' baryons ( i.e. , stars and cold gas ) contribute a substantial fraction of the mass . instead , at the 10  kpc radius used here for the lv relation , the dark matter is the dominant contribution to the mass in all but the largest galaxies .",
    "more importantly , the lv relation includes not only spiral galaxies , but all morphological types .",
    "thus , _ the lv relation is the relation between the galaxy luminosity and the total mass inside the 10  kpc fiducial radius . _    in order to make theoretical predictions for the lv relation , we need to estimate the luminosity of a galaxy expected to be hosted by a dark matter halo ( including those that are substructures of other halos ) .",
    "there are different ways to make those predictions .",
    "cosmological @xmath8-body+gasdynamics simulations will eventually be an ideal tool for this .",
    "however , simulations are still far from achieving the resolution and physical understanding necessary to correctly model the small scale physics of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "early simulations had problems reproducing the tf relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite could reproduce the slope of the tf relation , but created disks that were too faint by about @xmath9 magnitudes in the @xmath10-band for any given circular velocity .",
    "recently the situation has improved .",
    "for example , @xcite produced disk galaxies spanning a decade in mass that seem to fit both the @xmath10-band tf relation and the baryonic tf relation very well , as well as the observed abundance of milky way - type satellites .",
    "most recently , @xcite have produced perhaps the best match yet to a milky way - type galaxy in @xmath2 using a high - resolution smooth particle hydrodynamics simulation with a high density threshold for star formation .",
    "making predictions for a large ensemble of simulated galaxies is yet another challenge .",
    "semi - analytical models ( sams ) are a way to make some progress in this direction .",
    "these models have the advantage of producing large - number galaxy statistics .",
    "they typically include many free parameters controlling the strength of the various processes that affect the build - up of the stellar population of a galaxy ( i.e. , cooling , star formation , feedback , starbursts , agns , etc . ) .",
    "unfortunately , these normalizing parameters can be difficult to constrain observationally ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the models aim to reproduce the observed number distributions of galaxies as a function of observables such as luminosity , stellar mass , cold gas mass , and half - light radius , along with scaling laws such as the tully - fisher relation and the metallicity - luminosity relation .",
    "early sams suffered from serious defects .",
    "the models of @xcite were normalized using the observed tf relation zero - point , which resulted in a luminosity function with a very steep faint - end .",
    "on the other hand , models such as those of @xcite were normalized to reproduce the observed `` knee '' in the lf but this resulted in a large offset in the tf relation zero - point .",
    "later models have shown moderate success in reproducing either the luminosity function @xcite or the tf relation @xcite , but it has been difficult to match both simultaneously when rotation curves are treated realistically @xcite .",
    "@xcite used a combination of disk and halo reheating to obtain reasonable agreement with the observed lf except at the faint end , where they still overpredict the number of dwarf galaxies .",
    "if the wmap 5-year cosmology @xcite were used , their models would also produce too many very bright galaxies .",
    "the tf relation they obtain has the correct slope but their disks are too massive at any given luminosity .",
    "most recently , @xcite used a sophisticated version of their galform semi - analytic model to obtain sets of parameters that minimize the deviations from twenty one observational datasets including the lfs in several bands and at different redshifts , the tf relation , the average star formation rate as a function of redshift , clustering and metallicities among many others .",
    "not surprisingly , even their best model has difficulty fitting such a large number of simultaneous constraints . in particular , the lf in the @xmath11 band overpredicts the number of dwarf galaxies by almost an order of magnitude at the faint end , while the lfs at high redshift consistently overpredict the abundance of all galaxies .",
    "in addition , the halos they obtain contain too many satellite galaxies , resulting in too strong a galaxy two - point correlation in the one - halo regime .",
    "the tully - fisher relation of their best fit model also shows a systematic offset of about @xmath12 towards higher circular velocities for any given luminosity when compared to observations .",
    "recent high - resolution @xmath8-body cosmological simulations such as @xcite have volumes large enough to obtain the mass function of dark matter ( dm ) halos , but there is no direct way to compare it to observational measurements of the luminosity or stellar mass functions of galaxies .",
    "a new technique recently emerged that allows us to bridge the gap between dark matter halos and galaxies .",
    "it is commonly referred to as abundance matching @xcite .",
    "halo abundance matching ( ham ) resolves the issue of connecting observed galaxies to simulated dark matter ( dm ) halos by setting a one - to - one correspondence between red - band luminosity and dynamical mass : more luminous galaxies are assigned to more massive halos . by construction , it reproduces the observed luminosity function .",
    "it also reproduces the scale dependence of galaxy clustering over a range of epochs @xcite . when abundance matching is used for the observed stellar mass function @xcite , it gives a reasonably good fit to the lensing results @xcite on the relation between the stellar mass and the virial mass @xcite .",
    "@xcite also tried to reproduce the observed relation between the stellar mass and the circular velocity with partial success : there were deviations in both the shape and the amplitude . at circular velocities",
    "@xmath13 the predicted circular velocity was @xmath14% lower than the observed one .",
    "they argued that the disagreement is likely due to the fact that they did not include the effect of cold baryons .",
    "below we show that this is indeed the case .",
    "the paper is structured in the following way .",
    "section  [ sec : observations ] describes in detail the observational samples used to compare with the results of our analysis .",
    "section  [ sec : sim ] briefly describes our new bolshoi simulation @xcite and compares it to other large cosmological simulations . in section",
    "[ sec : halo ] we describe some characteristics of dark matter halos .",
    "section  [ sec : procedure ] describes the abundance matching method used to relate observed galaxies to the dm halos in the bolshoi simulation and explains the procedure used to measure key quantities such as the circular velocity for these model galaxies .",
    "section  [ sec : observations ] describes in detail the observational samples used to compare with the results of our analysis .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] shows the lv relation , the baryonic tully - fisher relation , the galaxy circular velocity function and the galaxy two - point correlation function obtained using our model and compares them to the observations described in section  [ sec : observations ] .",
    "a brief comparison with related results in the literature is given in section  [ sec : compare ] .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion ] presents a discussion of our results and section  [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes them .",
    "we use several datasets to construct the lv relation for observed galaxies . @xcite",
    "compiled a template @xmath10-band tully - fisher sample of 807 spiral galaxies of types sa - sd in order to calibrate distances to @xmath15 galaxies in the local universe .",
    "template galaxies were chosen to be members of nearby clusters in order to minimize distance errors .",
    "their photometry contains distance uncertainties so the scatter should be taken cautiously and only as an upper limit to the intrinsic tf scatter .",
    "circular velocities were obtained using hi line synthesis observations or optical h@xmath16 rotation curves when those were not available .",
    "the maximum circular velocity was obtained by using a model fit to the observed profiles .",
    "since the authors correct for the effects of turbulence by subtracting @xmath17 linearly from the velocity widths , it was necessary to de - correct them by adding this term back in to obtain the true circular velocities .",
    "the @xcite sample was selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "it is one of the most complete and unbiased samples available of h@xmath16 rotation curves of disk galaxies and was studied in an attempt to accurately measure the intrinsic scatter in the tf relation .",
    "luminosities were taken from sdss @xmath18-band photometry , yielding the best match with the luminosities assigned to our model galaxies .",
    "for this sample we used the asymptotic value of the rotation velocity they obtained using a functional fit to the rotation curves .    in order to test the predictions of the @xmath2 model using abundance matching ( @xmath2 + ham for short ) with the largest dynamic range possible , we included in our comparison the latest tully - fisher dwarf galaxy sample studied by @xcite .",
    "their sample consists of about 110 late - type galaxies with luminosities measured in the @xmath18-band and rotation velocities measured using hi emission .",
    "the three samples above constitute our major observational dataset .",
    "we further cut them by selecting galaxies with high inclinations ( @xmath19 or axis ratio @xmath20 ) to minimize uncertainties due to projection effects .",
    "additionally , we include only galaxies with better than @xmath21 accuracy in the measurement of the maximum circular velocity .",
    "these cuts leave a total of 972 galaxies in the major sample .    for comparison with the datasets mentioned above ,",
    "we include other smaller samples found in the literature .",
    "the sample of @xcite was also obtained from sdss and is comprised of only isolated galaxies with high inclinations . the hi galaxy sample used by @xcite",
    "was selected to have small scatter for use as a distance calibrator .",
    "it is important to note that while the fit shown here minimizes both the errors in rotation velocity and in luminosity , it may be artificially shallow due to selection effects .",
    "certain assumptions about galaxy colors had to be made in order to convert the different observational samples to the @xmath22-band measurements we chose for our model . in order to convert the @xmath10-band luminosities measured by @xcite to the @xmath18-band , we cross - referenced their data with the sample of @xcite and used the median @xmath23 colors of the galaxies present in both catalogs . to convert from the @xmath24-band magnitudes of @xcite to the sdss @xmath22-band we used the transformation equations obtained by @xcite along with the typical @xmath25 color of disk galaxies in the sdss sample studied by @xcite .",
    "in addition , for redshift zero data sets , the k - correction given in @xcite was used to convert from @xmath26 to @xmath27 photometric bands .",
    "lastly , since the obscuring effect of dust extinction as a function of disk inclination is corrected for in tully - fisher samples but not in observed lf estimates , we had to de - correct the luminosities of the spiral galaxies in all of the tf samples . to do so , we estimated and added the median extinction in the @xmath18-band as a function of rotation velocity using the method and sample employed by @xcite .",
    "this correction is @xmath28 mag for the brightest disks , declining to @xmath29 mag for @xmath30 .",
    "these values are close to those found by @xcite for the extinction in a galaxy with average inclination as a function of hi velocity width .",
    "the correction is implemented _ only _ when comparing the observations with our model galaxies .",
    "we also include bulge - dominated early - type galaxies ( ellipticals and lenticulars ) in the lv relation , again measuring the circular velocity at our fiducial 10  kpc radius .",
    "the circular velocity in this case is used not as a measure of rotation but merely as a probe of the mass profile , further justifying the use of the term `` lv relation '' instead of tf relation .",
    "using early - type galaxies allows us to probe closer to the mass regime where the abundance of dm halos drops exponentially ( i.e. , the knee of the velocity function ) , which is more sensitive to the cosmological model .",
    "it also allows for study of halo - galaxy relations without regard to the details of the evolution of the stellar populations within them .",
    "because of the challenges of both observing and modeling early - type galaxies , so far there exists no comprehensive set of mass measurements for them akin to the spiral galaxy samples .",
    "instead , we compile a set of high - quality lv estimates for individual galaxies from the literature .    to provide the necessary lv data for nearby elliptical and lenticular galaxies , we searched the literature for high - quality mass measurements at @xmath31 radii .",
    "a variety of different mass tracers were used including hot x - ray gas , a cold gas ring , and kinematics of stars , globular clusters , and planetary nebulae .",
    "we required the mass models to incorporate spatially - resolved temperature profiles in the case of x - ray studies , and to take some account of orbital anisotropy effects in the case of dynamics .",
    "we also used only those cases where @xmath32 was constrained to better than @xmath1  15% .",
    "we make no pretense that this is a systematic , unbiased , or especially accurate sample of early - type masses , noting simply that it is preferable to ignoring completely this class of galaxies which dominates the bright end of the luminosity function .    as an aside",
    ", we find in comparing to central velocity dispersions @xmath33 taken from hyperleda @xcite , that the scaling @xmath34 works very well on average , suggesting near - isothermal density profiles over a wide range of galaxy masses .",
    "it is far easier to measure @xmath33 observationally than @xmath35 , motivating the use of the former as a proxy for the true @xmath36 which is more robustly predicted by theory .",
    "the @xmath1  15% scatter that we find in the @xmath33@xmath35 relation is relatively small , but it is beyond the scope of this paper to consider the potential systematics of using @xmath33 as a proxy .",
    "we will use @xmath35 for the lv analysis in this paper .    for the luminosities",
    ", we make use of the total @xmath37-band apparent magnitudes from the rc3 @xcite , corrected for galactic extinction .",
    "to correct to @xmath22 magnitudes , we use the filter conversions in @xcite together with @xmath38 colors obtained from hyperleda @xcite .",
    "for the distances ( required both for absolute magnitudes and for choosing the circular velocity measurement radii in kpc ) , we use as a first choice the estimates from surface brightness fluctuations @xcite , and otherwise the recession velocity .",
    "the local data for 55 individual early - type galaxies are presented in figure  [ fig : etg ] ( left ) .",
    "dashed lines show @xmath37-band dynamical mass - to - light ratios of @xmath39 , 6 , 12 , and 24 ; for comparison , early - type galaxies with typical colors ( @xmath40@xmath41 ) are expected to have stellar @xmath42@xmath43 for a chabrier imf ( e.g. , fig .",
    "18 of @xcite ) .",
    "a table including the sources of the data is provided in appendix  [ sec : etgtable ] .",
    "there is no obvious systematic difference between the results from different mass tracers .",
    "the galaxies appear to trace a fairly tight lv sequence , except around the @xmath44 luminosity ( assuming @xmath45 ) , where there are a few galaxies whose circular velocities appear to be fairly high or low .",
    "the low-@xmath32 galaxies include ngc  821 and ngc  4494 , which were previously suggested as having a `` dearth of dark matter '' @xcite , and as implying a dark matter `` gap '' with respect to x - ray bright ellipticals @xcite .",
    "the present compilation suggests that the galaxy population in the local universe may fill in this gap , although further work will be needed to understand the scatter .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : etg ] shows the relation between stellar mass and circular velocity at 10 kpc for the galaxies in the early - type sample along with a few spirals for comparison .",
    "stellar masses were obtained using equation  ( [ eq : mlratio ] ) as explained in section  [ sec : barfracbtf ] .",
    "the ellipticals are virtually indistinguishable from the s0s in the regime where they overlap while the spirals seem to contain slightly more stellar mass at the same @xmath36 .",
    "we will discuss this issue in more detail in section  [ sec : barfracbtf ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : lv0 ] shows the combined lv relation for galaxies with very different morphologies : from magellanic dwarfs with @xmath46 to giant ellipticals with @xmath47 .",
    "the lv relation is not a simple power - law .",
    "dwarf galaxies show a tendency to have lower luminosities as compared with a simple power - law extrapolation from brighter magnitudes .",
    "there is a clear sign of bimodality at the bright end of the lv relation with early type galaxies having @xmath48 larger circular velocities as compared with spiral galaxies with the same @xmath18-band luminosity ( or , conversely , @xmath49 magnitude fainter at fixed @xmath36 ) .",
    "the bolshoi simulation was run using the following cosmological parameters : @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "these parameters are compatible with the wmap seven - year data ( wmap7 ) @xcite and with wmap5 combined with baryon acoustic oscillations and type 1a supernova data @xcite .",
    "the bolshoi parameters are in excellent agreement with the sdss maxbcg+wmap5 cosmological parameters @xcite and with cosmological parameters from wmap5 plus recent x - ray cluster survey results @xcite .",
    "it is important to appreciate that bolshoi differs essentially from another large , dm - only cosmological simulation : the millennium simulation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ms - i ) .",
    "the millennium simulation has been the basis for many studies of the distribution and statistical properties of dark matter halos and for semi - analytic models of the evolving galaxy population .",
    "this simulation and the more recent millennium - ii simulation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ms - ii ) used the first - year ( wmap1 ) cosmological parameters , which are rather different from the most recent estimates .",
    "the main difference is that the millennium simulations used a substantially larger amplitude of perturbations than bolshoi .",
    "formally , the value of @xmath55 used in the millennium simulations is more than 3@xmath56 away from the wmap5+bao+sn value and nearly 4@xmath56 away from the wmap7+bao+h@xmath57 value .",
    "however , the difference is even larger on galaxy scales because the millennium simulations also used a larger tilt @xmath58 of the power spectrum .",
    "the bolshoi simulation uses a computational box @xmath59 across and @xmath60  8.6 billion particles , which gives a mass resolution ( one particle mass ) of @xmath61 . the force resolution ( smallest cell size )",
    "is physical ( proper ) 1  . for comparison ,",
    "the millennium - i simulation had a force resolution ( plummer softening length ) 5   and the millennium - ii simulation had 1  .",
    "the bolshoi simulation was run with the adaptive - refinement - tree ( art ) code , which is an adaptive - mesh - refinement ( amr ) type code .",
    "a detailed description of the code is given in @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more details specific to the use of the code for the simulation .",
    "we use a parallel ( mpi+openmp ) version of the bound - density - maxima ( bdm ) algorithm to identify halos in bolshoi @xcite .",
    "bdm does not distinguish between halos and subhalos  they are treated in the same way .",
    "the code locates maxima of density in the distribution of particles , removes unbound particles , and provides several statistics for halos including virial mass and radius , as well as density profiles .",
    "we use the virial mass definition @xmath62 that follows from the top - hat model in the expanding universe with a cosmological constant .",
    "we define the virial radius @xmath63 of halos as the radius within which the mean density is the virial overdensity times the mean universal matter density @xmath64 at that redshift .",
    "thus , the virial mass is given by @xmath65 for our set of cosmological parameters , at @xmath26 the virial radius @xmath63 is defined as the radius of a sphere enclosing average overdensity equal to @xmath66 times the average matter density . the overdensity limit changes with redshift and asymptotically goes to 178 for high @xmath67 .",
    "different definitions are also found in the literature .",
    "for example , the often used overdensity 200 relative to the _ critical _ density gives mass @xmath68 , which for milky - way - mass halos is about 1.2 - 1.3 times smaller than @xmath62 .",
    "the exact relation depends on halo concentration .    at each timestep there",
    "are about 10  million halos in bolshoi ( 8.8@xmath69 at @xmath26 , 12.3  @xmath69 at @xmath70 , 4.8  @xmath69 at @xmath71 ) .",
    "the halo catalogs are complete for halos with @xmath72   ( @xmath73 ) . in order to track evolution of halos over time",
    ", we find and store the 50 most bound particles . together with other parameters of the halo ( coordinates , velocities , virial mass , and circular velocity ) the information on most bound particles is used to identify the same halos at different moments of time .",
    "the procedure of halo tracking starts at @xmath26 and goes back in time .",
    "the final result is the history ( _ track _ ) of the major progenitor of a given halo .",
    "we distinguish between two types of halos . a halo can be either distinct ( not inside the virial radius of a larger halo ) , or a subhalo if it is inside of a larger halo .",
    "for both distinct halos and subhalos , the bdm halo finder provides the maximum circular velocity @xmath74 throughout this paper we will use term _ circular velocity _ to mean maximum circular velocity .    as the main characteristic of the dm halos we use their circular velocity @xmath36 .",
    "there are advantages to using @xmath36 as compared with the virial mass @xmath62 .",
    "the virial mass is a well defined quantity for distinct halos , but it is ambiguous for subhalos .",
    "it strongly depends on how a particular halo - finder code defines the truncation radius and removes unbound particles .",
    "it also depends on the distance to the center of the host halo because of the effects of tidal stripping . instead , the circular velocity is less prone to those complications .",
    "the main motivation for using @xmath36 in this work is that it is more closely related to the properties of the central regions of halos and , thus , to galaxies hosted by those halos .",
    "for example , for a milky - way type halo the radius of the maximum circular velocity is about 40  kpc ( and @xmath36 is nearly the same at 20  kpc ) , while the virial radius is about 200  kpc .",
    "in addition , the virial mass of a dm halo is not an easily observable quantity and this further limits its use for comparison of simulations with observations .",
    "tidal stripping can lead to significant mass loss in the periphery of subhalos .",
    "the net effect at redshift zero of the complex interactions that each halo undergoes is a decrease in the maximum circular velocity compared to its peak value over the entire history of the halo .",
    "the galaxy residing in the central region of the halo should not experience much stripping and should preserve most of its mass inside the optical radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . following this argument , the initial total mass distribution and rotation profile of the halo",
    "are frozen at the moment before the halo is accreted and starts to experience stripping .",
    "we refer to this circular velocity as @xmath75 . in practice",
    "we find the peak circular velocity of the halo over its entire history .",
    "further details on the halo tracking procedure can be found in @xcite .",
    "to investigate the statistics of galaxies and their relation to host dm halos as predicted by the @xmath2 model using ham , we obtained the properties of our model galaxies using the following procedure :    1 .   using the merger tree of each dm halo and subhalo ,",
    "obtain @xmath76 the peak value of the circular velocity over the history of the halo ( this is typically the circular velocity of the halo when it is first accreted ) .",
    "perform abundance matching of the velocity function of the halos to the lf of galaxies to obtain the luminosity of each model galaxy .",
    "2 .   perform abundance matching of the velocity function to the stellar mass function of galaxies to obtain the stellar mass of each model galaxy .",
    "3 .   use the observed gas - to - stellar mass ratio as a function of stellar mass to assign cold gas masses to our model galaxies .",
    "the stellar mass added to the cold gas mass becomes the cold baryonic mass .",
    "4 .   using the density profiles of the dm halos ,",
    "obtain the circular velocity at @xmath77 ( @xmath35 ) from the center of each halo . to do this , calculate the dark - matter - only contribution by multiplying the dm mass profile , obtained directly from the simulation , by the factor @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the cosmological fraction of baryons . ] .",
    "then take the total cold baryon contribution from step 3 and assume it is enclosed within a radius of @xmath77 .",
    "adding the two contributions gives the total mass required to calculate @xmath35 .",
    "5 .   implement the correction to @xmath35 due to the adiabatic contraction of the dm halos due to the infall of the cold baryon component to the center .",
    "we now explain each of the above 5 steps in detail .",
    "using the key assumption that halos with deeper potential wells become sites where more baryons can gather to form larger and more luminous galaxies , we ranked our halos and subhalos using their @xmath36 , and starting from the bright end of the @xmath18-band lf , assigned luminosities to each according to their space density using the prescription found in @xcite .",
    "in other words , we found the unique one - to - one correspondence that would match the halo velocity function with the luminosity function of observed galaxies .",
    "of course , this is a simplifying approximation . it does not discriminate between blue ( star - forming ) and red ( quenched ) galaxies , for example .",
    "in this paper we use the schechter fit to the @xmath18-band galaxy lf measurement of @xcite obtained from the sdss data release 6 ( dr6 ) galaxy sample .",
    "the fit is characterized by the parameters : @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "since the median redshift of the sdss dr6 sample is @xmath83 @xcite , all our subsequent results will be shown in @xmath22-band magnitudes .    as an alternative",
    ", we also consider a lf with a steeper slope at low - luminosities .",
    "@xcite obtained the sdss lf including dwarfs as faint as @xmath84 and investigated surface brightness completeness at the faint end of the distribution .",
    "their steeper value of the faint - end slope was obtained by weighting the abundance of each galaxy by its estimated surface brightness completeness . to quantify the effect of including low surface brightness galaxies in our model ( those with petrosian half - light @xmath18-band surface brightness greater than 24.0 mag / arcsec@xmath85 )",
    ", we increased the abundance of bright galaxies in the @xcite lf to match the @xcite lf at the bright end while keeping the steep faint - end slope ( @xmath86 ) measured by @xcite .",
    "the modified lf produces 60% more galaxies at @xmath87 and over a factor of 2.5 more galaxies at @xmath88 . using this lf to perform the abundance matching increases the luminosity of galaxies assigned to small dm halos , steepening the faint end of the lv relation .",
    "it is important to note that we assume that each dark matter halo or subhalo must contain a galaxy with a detectable luminous component ( for the sdss @xmath18-band this requires galaxies to be detectable in visible wavelengths ) and this component must evolve in a way that guarantees its detectability at @xmath26 . since the effective volume surveyed by sdss dr6 at @xmath89 is comparable to the volume of the bolshoi simulation , we expect the statistics of the halo population to be comparable to those of the observed galaxies all the way up to the large mass / luminosity tail of the distributions .",
    "even though bolshoi contains a factor of @xmath90 more objects than the sample of @xcite , abundance matching is mostly insensitive to uncertainties in the high - luminosity tail of the lf .",
    "the next step is to separate the dm and baryon components in each halo and allow the baryons to dissipatively sink to the centers of the dm halos .",
    "we assume for simplicity that there is a radius at which we could consider most of the cold baryons to be enclosed , with only dark matter present beyond that point .",
    "this cold baryon component has been observed to comprise only a small fraction of the cosmic abundance of baryons ; in other words , the cold baryon fraction @xmath91 in galaxies is much lower @xcite than @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "we resort to the observations and use the galaxy stellar mass function obtained from the sdss dr7 by @xcite , who employ estimates of stellar masses by @xcite obtained using five - band sdss photometry assuming the universal imf of @xcite . these masses are consistent with those estimated using single - color and spectroscopic techniques @xcite .    using the same procedure described above for the luminosity function , we abundance - matched the halos in bolshoi to the galaxies in the sdss dr7 starting from the high stellar mass end until reaching our completeness limit at @xmath93 , obtaining stellar masses for each galaxy . strictly speaking",
    ", this procedure results in a one - to - one relation between circular velocity and stellar mass - to - light ratio which should only be interpreted as the _ average _ of a population of galaxies with a given @xmath94 .",
    "the scatter ( or bimodality ) in the mass - to - light ratio as a function of circular velocity could be measured from observations and included in the assignment but would not change our results significantly .",
    "since dwarfs can have most of their cold baryons in the gas phase instead of in stars @xcite , we calculated for each model galaxy the total cold gas mass using a parameterization of the observed atomic gas mass fraction as a function of stellar mass from @xcite ( their equation ( 9 ) , shown as a dashed line in their figure 11 ) .",
    "this includes the total cold atomic gas found in the disk only .",
    "the gas - to - stellar mass ratio @xmath95 depends on stellar mass and it is the largest for dwarfs .",
    "for example , @xmath96 for galaxies with @xmath97 .",
    "it declines to @xmath98 for galaxies with @xmath99",
    ". it should be even smaller for ellipticals and s0s .",
    "it should be noted that , when it comes to dynamical corrections to @xmath94 , the gas plays a minor role .",
    "it only becomes important when we consider the baryonic tully - fisher relation .",
    "lastly , we add the stellar and cold gas masses for each model galaxy and obtain the correction to the circular velocity of the pure dm halo at a radius enclosing the cold baryonic mass .",
    "we set this value to @xmath77 for all the halos in our sample . in the case of dwarf galaxies",
    "this should be a good approximation to the maximum circular velocity since their rotation curves rise much more slowly and in some cases they peak beyond the optical radius @xcite .",
    "our assumption allows us to include the peak of the rotation curve for most of these galaxies . in the case",
    "that the peak is located well within @xmath77 the correction would be almost negligible since we would be still measuring rotation in the flat regime . additionally , truncating the cold baryons at a radius of @xmath77 allows us to directly calculate the correction to the circular velocity at that radius without having to resort to more complicated assumptions about the distribution of baryonic matter in galaxies , i.e. , exponential lengths and srsic indices of disks and bulges as well as extended gas and stellar halos .    to obtain the circular velocity measured at @xmath77 ( @xmath35 ) for the bolshoi dm halos , we need to use dark matter profiles and find the dark matter mass inside a 10  kpc radius . to do this ,",
    "we could use the individual profile of each halo .",
    "however , once we select halos with a given maximum circular velocity , individual halo - to - halo variations are small at 10  kpc ( the situation is different if we select halos using virial mass , which results in large deviations in concentration producing large variations in @xmath35 ) .",
    "this is why instead of individual profiles we construct average profiles for halos within a narrow range @xmath100 of maximum circular velocity .",
    "we first bin and average the circular velocity profiles of the distinct halos found by the bdm code .",
    "these profiles are calculated for each halo ( including unbound particles ) in logarithmic radial bins in units of @xmath63 .",
    "using distinct halos is convenient because it gives us density profiles that are less affected by interactions than those of subhalos . for the inner profiles of subhalos the effect is relatively small because the stripping happens preferentially at the outer radii . using the averaged binned circular velocity profiles we obtain the velocity at @xmath77 . within about @xmath101 of the virial radius ,",
    "discreteness effects render the profiles unreliable and we use instead extrapolation with the shape of a simple power - law in radius . for halos with @xmath102",
    "the full extent of the profiles suffer from measurement noise which we avoid by extrapolating from the profile of halos with @xmath103 .",
    "figure  [ fig : v10 ] shows the obtained median relation between the maximum circular velocity @xmath104 and @xmath35 for the bolshoi dm halos without inclusion of the cold baryons .",
    "the estimates of the relations obtained when a parametric form of the density profile is used are also shown for the case of the nfw @xcite @xmath105 and the einasto @xcite universal profiles @xmath106 \\right\\ } ;   \\label{eq : einasto}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 is the radius at which the logarithmic slope of the density profile is @xmath108 . following @xcite , we use @xmath109 .",
    "the concentration parameter defined for both models as @xmath110 is given by the relations obtained in paper i for distinct halos ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) : @xmath111 and @xmath112 note that in figure  [ fig : v10 ] we use total dynamical masses and do not account for the condensation of baryons .",
    "for @xmath113 the rotation ( or density ) profiles of the bolshoi simulation are extremely well approximated by the einasto parameterization , whereas nfw underestimates @xmath35 by almost @xmath114 at @xmath115 .",
    "following the conclusions of @xcite and @xcite , we assume the einasto profile when extrapolating the inner parts of the largest ( @xmath116 ) halos .",
    "dissipation allows the baryons to condense into galaxies in the central regions of dm halos dragging the surrounding dark matter into a new more concentrated equilibrium configuration . if the density of the dm halo increases considerably within the extent of the disk , the peak circular velocity could be much larger than our previous estimates .",
    "there are different approximations for the adiabatic compression of the dark matter .",
    "@xcite provide a simple analytical expression , which is known to overpredict the effect . the approximation proposed by @xcite predicts significantly smaller increase in the density of the dark matter .",
    "more recent simulations indicate even smaller compression @xcite .",
    "however , at a 10  kpc radius the dark matter contributes a relatively large fraction of mass even for large galaxies . as a result ,",
    "the difference between the strong compression model of @xcite and no - compression is only @xmath117% in velocity .",
    "we use the standard adiabatic contraction ( ac ) model of @xcite to bracket the possible effect .",
    "we thus assume that following the condensation of the baryons , the dark matter particles adjust the radius of their orbits while conserving angular momentum in the process .",
    "we solve the equation @xmath118r_{\\rm f } ,    \\label{eq : ac}\\ ] ] where @xmath119 , @xmath120 is the total baryonic mass assigned to each halo and @xmath121 is the universal fraction of baryons .",
    "we solve equation  ( [ eq : ac ] ) for @xmath122 and then add the dark matter mass @xmath123 to the mass of cold baryons to find the circular velocity .",
    "note that this implies that only cold baryons ( i.e. , stars and cold gas ) are left in the central regions of the galaxy , while the remaining hot baryons are at larger radii .",
    "as expected , only the halos that are dominated by baryons at their centers suffer a significant increase in their measured circular velocities due to the increase in concentration of dark matter as result of adiabatic contraction .",
    "figure  [ fig : lv1 ] shows the predicted lv relation for galaxies in the @xmath2 model obtained using halo abundance matching .",
    "we binned together the major observational samples described in section  [ sec : observations ] and include them for comparison .",
    "the internal extinction de - correction for late - type galaxies described in section  [ sec : ltg ] was implemented for a fair comparison with the models .",
    "the full curve in this plot shows results obtained using the @xcite lf of galaxies in the sdss dr6 sample and uses the adiabatic contraction model of @xcite .",
    "the 1- and 2-@xmath56 width of the distribution of model galaxies in bins of luminosity is represented by the shaded regions ( details about the model used to add scatter can be found in section  [ sec : scatter ] ) .",
    "predictions without adiabatic contraction ( with the cold baryon contribution added in quadrature ) are shown as the dot - dashed curve .",
    "the dashed curve shows the effect of a steeper slope at the faint end of the lf that accounts for potential surface brightness incompleteness .",
    "( for details see section  [ sec : procedure ] ) .",
    "although dwarf galaxies with @xmath124 seem to agree better with a model using the @xcite luminosity function , the scatter of the observed dwarf lv relation is so large that both lfs used in conjunction with the abundance of dm halos produce results that are consistent with the available data .",
    "one may note that the ac model misses late - type points with @xmath125 and the no - ac model practically fits most of the late - type measurements .",
    "this should _ not _ be interpreted as either an advantage for the no - ac model or a disadvantage for the ac model .",
    "our predictions apply to the average population across all types of galaxies . because of the dichotomy of the lv diagram , a model that goes through either early - type galaxies or through late - type galaxies is an incorrect model .",
    "the correct answer should be a model which tends to be close to spirals at low luminosities ( where spirals dominate the statistics ) and gradually slides towards the ellipticals at the high - luminosity tail where they dominate .",
    "it seems that the ac model does exactly that , but it may overpredict the circular velocities at the very bright tail of the lv relation .    as demonstrated in section  [ sec : scatter ] , our stochastic ham model accounts for galaxies that reside in halos with both smaller and larger @xmath36 than the average .",
    "for example , since the most massive spiral galaxies comprise a very small percentage of the galaxy population with @xmath126 ( less than 10% ) , in our model they are assigned to the low-@xmath36 wing of the distribution shown in figure  [ fig : lv1 ] .",
    "hence , even though the model makes predictions for the average galaxy population , it also accounts for the morphological bimodality observed in the lv relation .",
    "one also should not overestimate the quality of the observations .",
    "the fact that in figure  [ fig : lv1 ] the brightest spirals with @xmath127 are more than 2-@xmath56 away from the mean of the models is not a problem because of the size of the uncertainties in the observational data .",
    "for instance , there is a systematic @xmath128% velocity offset between the measurements of @xcite and @xcite , which seems to point to the current uncertainties in the lv relation .    considering the current level of the uncertainties ,",
    "our model galaxies show remarkable agreement with observations spanning an order of magnitude in circular velocity ( or , equivalently , three orders of magnitude in halo mass ) and more than three orders of magnitude in luminosity . for galaxies above @xmath129",
    ", our model produces results that agree extremely well with the observed luminosities of early - types ( es and s0s ) .",
    "given how simple the prescription is , it is perhaps surprising how closely we can reproduce the properties of observed galaxies",
    ". for galaxies with @xmath130 , dm halos without any corrections already occupy the region expected for galaxies .",
    "the dynamical corrections improve the fits , but it is important to emphasize that the abundance matching method yields the correct normalization of the lv relation regardless of the details of the corrections we implement .",
    "another feature of the relation , its steepening below @xmath131 , is caused by the the shallow faint - end slope of the luminosity function .",
    "although our model galaxies in this regime are slightly underluminous as compared with a simple power - law extrapolation from brighter galaxies , observed dwarfs seem to predict a deviation from a power - law tf in the same general direction .    in the way it was constructed , our model galaxy sample does not include uncertainties in either the halo velocity function or in the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "this produces an lv relation with no scatter .",
    "section  [ sec : scatter ] examines the effects of including scatter in the halo matching procedure .",
    "we now discuss in greater detail the results of the individual steps explained in section  [ sec : procedure ] .",
    "observations do not always provide measurements of the circular velocity at 10  kpc .",
    "this is especially true for dwarf galaxies where the last measured point of the rotation curve can be at 3 - 5  kpc .",
    "what are the errors associated with using measurements at different radii ?",
    "figure  [ fig : vcirc ] presents three typical examples of the circular velocities expected for galaxies with vastly different masses .    the top panel shows a model of a giant elliptical galaxy with @xmath132 of stellar mass distributed according to a @xmath133 law with a half - light radius of @xmath134  kpc .",
    "the stellar component is embedded in a dark matter halo with virial mass @xmath135 and median concentration @xmath136 .",
    "the maximum circular velocity ( 310  ) of the halo is reached at 160  kpc .",
    "the middle panel shows a milky way - size model with maximum circular velocity 190  , virial mass @xmath137 , and median concentration @xmath138 for its mass .",
    "the cold baryonic component consists of a hernquist bulge ( @xmath139 , half - mass radius @xmath140  kpc ) and an exponential disk ( @xmath141 , scale radius @xmath142  kpc ) .",
    "the bottom panel shows a dwarf galaxy model with @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145  .",
    "its cold baryons have two exponential disks : one for stars and and one for cold gas with a mass ratio of 1:4 and radii @xmath146  kpc and @xmath147  kpc .",
    "the total mass in cold baryons is @xmath148 .",
    "when we include baryons , we assume that most of them were blown out from the models and the only baryons left are in the form of stars and cold gas .",
    "as in bolshoi , the `` dm '' circular velocities in figure  [ fig : vcirc ] include a cosmological amount of baryons that traces the distribution of the dark matter .",
    "this contribution is removed from the mass profiles before adding the cold baryons . in all three cases",
    "we use the einasto dark matter profiles ( equation  ( [ eq : einasto ] ) ) with @xmath149 . for the models labeled `` dm+baryons '' at each radius",
    "we simply add the mass of cold baryons and the mass of dark matter .",
    "the models termed `` dm+baryons+ac '' include adiabatic compression of dark matter according to the prescription of @xcite .    after adding the cold baryons the circular velocity profiles become rather flat in the inner @xmath150  kpc regions of the galaxies implying that measurements of circular velocities anywhere in this region are accurate enough to provide the value of the circular velocity at 10  kpc .",
    "there are some caveats in choosing 10  kpc as a fiducial radius for either extremely massive spirals or giant ellipticals .",
    "considering the correlation between central surface brightness and disk scale - length found by @xcite , the most luminous disks appear to have scale - lengths as large as @xmath151 , whereas according to @xcite their rotation curves peak at about 1 scale - length .",
    "hence , we may be _ underestimating _ the maximum observed rotation velocity of these galaxies in our sample",
    ". we may also _ overestimate _ circular velocities when we assume that most of the cold baryon mass is inside 10  kpc radius . in principle , some corrections can be applied to compensate this effect . however ,",
    "our estimates show that at most this is a @xmath152% effect for spirals and somewhat smaller for ellipticals because they are more compact for the same luminosity .",
    "considering existing uncertainties and complexities of implementing the correction , we decided not to use them .      to illustrate the effect of tidal stripping , figure  [ fig : lv2 ] shows the results ( dashed curve ) obtained when the luminosity assignment is performed using the peak historical value of each halo s circular velocity ( @xmath153 ) as compared with the circular velocity at @xmath26 ( dotted curve ) .",
    "the reason why the dashed curve is rightwards of the dotted one is that for subhalos the circular velocity estimated at @xmath26 is smaller than its value at accretion @xmath153 .",
    "if we compare luminosities at the same circular velocity , the differences can be substantial : almost one magnitude for galaxies with @xmath154  due to the steep slope of the lv relation for dwarfs . in terms of velocities ,",
    "the differences are much smaller .",
    "neglecting the effects of stripping in the assignment scheme affects mostly dwarf galaxies , overestimating their circular velocities by a maximum of @xmath155 . for larger galaxies the effect decreases to less than @xmath156",
    "this is due to the fact that stripping only affects subhalos and they comprise only a minority ( about @xmath114 ) of the total halo population .",
    "in addition , only the small number of subhalos which orbit close to their host halo s center get significantly stripped and experience a substantial decline in their circular velocity .",
    "comparison of lv relations constructed using @xmath75 one with the maximum the circular velocity ( the dashed curve in figure  [ fig : lv2 ] ) and another with velocities @xmath75 estimated at 10  kpc ( the full curve ) indicates that this affects the largest halos the most .",
    "for example , the @xmath32 velocity is almost a factor of two smaller than @xmath157 for the group - size halos presented in the plot .",
    "taking the circular velocity at 10  kpc also makes the lv relation much less curved as compared with the maximum velocity .",
    "below @xmath158 the maximum circular velocity of the dm halo happens near or within 10  kpc , which explains why the curve does not shift in this regime .",
    "figure  [ fig : lv3 ] shows how cold baryons change the circular velocity at a 10  kpc radius .",
    "here we use two extreme approximations that bracket the effect .",
    "the first approximation assumes that there is no change in the distribution of the dark matter .",
    "all simulations so far indicate that there is some compression .",
    "hence , the no compression approximation definitely underpredicts the circular velocity @xmath32 .",
    "the second approximation uses the adiabatic compression model of @xcite which produces the largest increase in the density of the dark matter .",
    "( the full and dashed curves were already shown in figure  [ fig : lv1 ] ) .",
    "there are some differences between the lv relations predicted by those approximations .",
    "however , the largest effect is just adding the cold baryons in quadrature to the circular velocity of the dark matter .",
    "adiabatic compression increases the circular velocity even further , but the effect is relatively minor because the fraction of cold baryons gets progressively smaller for larger galaxies .",
    "the amount of cold baryons used for the models is crucial for this test . as we discuss in section  [ sec : barfracbtf ] , the abundance matching predicts relatively small cold baryon masses for dwarfs and giants , and this is why the adiabatic compression in figures  [ fig : vcirc ] and [ fig : lv3 ] is 10 - 20% at the most .",
    "again , dwarfs below @xmath158 are insensitive to the cold baryon presence . here the full curve ( dm+baryons ) is slightly below the @xmath36 of the dark matter curve because the latter includes a cosmological fraction of baryons which trace the dm , most of which are assumed to be blown out from galaxies ( see section  [ sec : procedure ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : lv4 ] shows the lv relation that we would obtain by assuming instead that half of all baryons within the virial radius or equivalently 8% of the virial mass are retained and are used to build the central galaxy ( while luminosity is not affected ) . both the shape and the normalization of the lv relation",
    "are incorrect , with the circular velocities systematically larger than observations by up to @xmath159 . clearly , it is difficult to obtain the observed lv relation assuming a constant cold baryon fraction in the framework of the @xmath2 cosmology .",
    "so far , the abundance matching procedure we have used assumed a monotonic one - to - one relation between halo circular velocity and galaxy luminosity or stellar mass .",
    "this assumption produces average relations that can be compared with the medians of the observations .",
    "as shown by previous studies , a more detailed treatment of the scatter between halo and galaxy properties may yield average relations of the brightest galaxies that deviate significantly from the case with no scatter .",
    "for instance , @xcite showed that iteratively introducing log - normal scatter of width @xmath160 mags in the assignment of luminosities to dm halos produces an average tf relation with massive galaxies that are brighter by about one magnitude compared to the monotonic assignment . by treating the scatter analytically , @xcite found that performing halo abundance matching using their preferred value of @xmath161 dex of log - normal scatter reduces the average stellar mass assigned to massive halos with total masses @xmath162 by up to @xmath163 ( when binning using virial mass ) but does not affect less massive galaxies below the knee of the stellar mass function .",
    "appendix  [ sec : appendix ] gives a detailed description of the method we employ to introduce scatter in our model . in short ,",
    "we obtain luminosities for each of the galaxies in our sample by stochastically scattering the values obtained in the monotonic assignment while forcing the preservation of the observed luminosity function .",
    "when scattering the values of luminosity we do not constrain the shape of the probability distribution ( e.g. , log - normal ) or require its width to be constant for all circular velocities . this",
    "is well justified since the shape of the intrinsic scatter is more difficult to constrain observationally ( e.g. , due to observational systematics ) .",
    "one parameter that our model does not currently predict is the width of the probability distribution of luminosity at a fixed halo circular velocity .",
    "this scatter originates from three main sources .",
    "the first is the observational error in the determination of the true luminosities of galaxies .",
    "since we use the lf from the sdss spectroscopic sample , these are the sum of the errors in photometry plus the errors in the distances obtained from spectroscopy . at the mean redshift of the sample",
    "these combined errors are expected to be typically much less than @xmath164 mags .",
    "the second source of scatter is the one present in the intrinsic relation between halo circular velocity and galaxy luminosity due to variation in the physical processes of galaxy formation .",
    "@xcite studied the nature of the intrinsic scatter in the tully - fisher relation from hi observations and obtained a value of @xmath165 in the _ r_-band .",
    "this value is consistent with the distribution in the observational samples used in this work .",
    "lastly , since we assign luminosities that are uncorrected for the inclination of disk galaxies , we also need to include the scatter that results from the distribution of dust extinction corrections observed in sdss .",
    "@xcite find a fit to this distribution as a weak function of @xmath18-band luminosity and disk scale length .",
    "we adopt the value @xmath166 they use for a galaxy with @xmath167 .",
    "we neglect the errors due to photometry and distances and add the remaining two contributions in quadrature to obtain @xmath168 , which we use to introduce scatter to the model galaxies below the knee of the lf . above this luminosity , where early - types dominate , we assume that the lack of significant internal extinction slightly reduces the scatter to @xmath29 .",
    "figure  [ fig : lv5 ] shows the luminosity - binned distribution of model galaxies in the lv relation obtained from the stochastic ham scheme and compares it to the monotonic assignment discussed in section  [ sec : tf ] . since we are left with a choice regarding which quantity to average over , we choose to bin in @xmath18-band magnitude to be consistent with the binning of the observations .",
    "the mean relation is almost identical to the case with no scatter for galaxies below @xmath129 , while it becomes brighter by up to @xmath169 magnitudes for more massive galaxies .",
    "galaxies below @xmath170 show a distribution of luminosities that is close to gaussian as far as 2-@xmath56 away from the mean but has a slightly longer bright tail .",
    "galaxies brighter than @xmath170 show a trend of narrowing of the distribution as well as a skewness that reduces the number of upscattered galaxies with increasing luminosity .    to check the consistency of our approach we also calculated the average lv relation of our model galaxies obtained using the deconvolution method described in @xcite and log - normal scatter .",
    "this procedure yields a deviation of the mean relation for @xmath171 towards higher luminosities that depends on the assumed width of the scatter .",
    "figure  [ fig : lv6 ] in appendix  [ sec : appendix ] shows this effect for constant @xmath172 ( left panel ) and @xmath173 decreasing from 0.5 to 0.3 past @xmath170 ( right panel ) .",
    "even with a variable width that mimics our approach , the luminosity - binned spread obtained with the method of @xcite is unrealistically large at the bright end .",
    "the differences between the results of the two methods actually reside in the assumptions about the shape of the spread .",
    "since our stochastic assignment scheme does not constrain the scatter distribution to be log - normal and centered on the monotonic relation , the resulting skewness beyond @xmath170 allows it to preserve the median lv relation of the scatterless sample .",
    "in addition , without a skewed distribution it is extremely difficult to obtain a narrower distribution of galaxies at the bright end of the lv relation .    from this analysis",
    "we conclude that the introduction of scatter in luminosity at a given halo circular velocity yields a median relation at the bright end that is sensitive to the shape and width of the probability distribution function used .",
    "the median lv relation is thus robust to uncertainties in the nature of the scatter below the shoulder of the lf , allowing for a direct comparison with observations .",
    "we prefer our scatter method for two reasons .",
    "first , it _",
    "exactly _ preserves the luminosity function while the deconvolution method only does so _",
    "approximately_. second , it naturally produces an observed luminosity - binned distribution that becomes narrower for the brightest galaxies , in agreement with that expected from observations .      for the lv relation",
    "the cold baryons played an ancillary role : they provided a correction to the circular velocity at 10  kpc .",
    "the correction is small for galaxies below @xmath131 . for large galaxies",
    "the cold baryon contribution increases and typically is about half of the mass within @xmath174 .",
    "regardless of their role in the lv relation , baryons are one of the prime subjects for the theory of galaxy formation . unfortunately , accurate measurements of baryonic masses are also prone to some uncertainties",
    ". dynamical measurements of the baryonic component are difficult because of dark matter - baryon degeneracies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in other words , the baryon mass depends on what is assumed about the dark matter .",
    "population synthesis provides an independent estimate of the stellar mass , but it has its share of complexities including the uncertainty in the initial mass function .",
    "in addition to the stellar mass , most galaxies have an important ( if not dominant ) fraction of their cold baryons in the form of neutral hydrogen gas . for consistency , in this paper",
    "we make use of stellar population synthesis estimates of stellar masses whenever possible .",
    "the baryonic tully - fisher relation ( btf ) is one way of displaying the amount of cold baryons in galaxies .",

    "these estimates are fully compatible with the stellar masses used in the stellar mass function of @xcite as part of our model .",
    "@xcite present results based on the hi nearby galaxy survey ( things ) : @xcite . the measurement of luminosities in the infrared using _ spitzer _",
    "results in reliable estimates of the stellar masses that are consistent with the @xcite results . in this case",

    "other authors have come to the same conclusions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "unfortunately , it is more difficult to obtain it from observations and so far , there have been only a few attempts to do so @xcite .    for the theory",

    "the abundance of mw - type galaxies is predicted to within @xmath159 when adiabatic contraction is taken into account , and within a few percent when no contraction takes place . from our earlier analysis of the lv relation in section  [ sec : results ] we are led to believe that halo contraction is needed to obtain the correct position of elliptical and s0 galaxies in the plot .",

    "one interpretation of this is that the dwarf overabundance problem can not be resolved if both the lv relation and the vf of dwarf galaxies are to be reproduced simultaneously . in other words",
    ", these galaxies must undergo a process that limits their abundance without changing their dynamical mass . the first possible origin for the large discrepancy between our model galaxies and the hipass vf could be observational bias .",
    "hipass is a blind hi survey and does not detect gas - poor galaxies . only if gas - poor dwarf spheroidals dominate the galaxy population below @xmath196 would it be possible to reconcile our results with the survey .",
    "this is highly unlikely since this type of galaxies are only a small fraction of the total dwarf population . on the other hand ,",

    "this in turn implies that the measured rotation curves of a large fraction of dwarfs must severely underestimate the true maximum circular velocities of these galaxies . the only possible explanation for this bias would be that the optical and hi disk is truncated well inside the radius where the rotation curve flattens out .",
    "another solution to the missing dwarf problem requires most of these galaxies to have a low enough surface brightness in hi to be undetectable in current surveys .",
    "this would imply the existence of a large number of small halos containing little or no neutral gas .",
    "the most important success of the halo abundance matching technique is considered to be reproducing the observed galaxy clustering measured in the form of the galaxy correlation function in its various forms , both in the local universe and at high redshift @xcite .",
    "most of these works claimed to match the observed clustering although they relied on simulations with either very low resolution or outdated cosmological parameters .",

    "this makes the correlation function an even more robust prediction of the model .    in order to compare our model with observations",

    "the integration is traditionally performed to wash out the effects of redshift distortions .",
    "we limit the calculation of the correlation function to distances below @xmath200 to avoid scales at which much of the power comes from long waves that are absent in the simulation due to the finite box size .",
    "the small - scale correlation function of dm halos is extremely sensitive to the abundance of satellite halos near the centers of hosts . as a result of this",

    "further scrutiny is necessary to understand the origin of the effect and make more robust comparisons with observations .",

    "the correlation amplitude of model galaxies fainter than @xmath213 is essentially unchanged compared to the monotonic assignment result shown in figure  [ fig : cf ] .",
    "the clustering of the bright galaxies with @xmath214 shows a slight decrease at all separations except the smallest ones , and thus better agreement with the sdss data .",

    "this is consistent with the upward shift in the average luminosity of the brightest galaxies in the lv relation ( figure  [ fig : lv5 ] ) .",
    "the correlation functions of galaxies in fainter bins are indistinguishable from those without scatter .    in summary , applying our physically motivated scatter model maintains ( and even improves ) the excellent agreement of the @xmath2+ham model with the observed galaxy clustering .",
    "the clustering of the most massive and rare galaxies ( those above @xmath215 ) will be more sensitive to the addition of scatter and the model used to implement it .",

    "* ) , which results in halo concentrations that are @xmath130% lower than what @xcite used in their preferred model . in turn",
    ", this reduces the dark matter circular velocities in the inner regions of halos by about 15% .",
    "some of the necessary corrections were discussed by @xcite and it was shown that they substantially improve the fit of the tf relation . however , the main difference is the treatment of the luminosity function .",

    "however , it seems that their analytical scaling with @xmath55 was not accurate enough : the concentrations _ actually used _ by @xcite are practically ( within 3% ) the same as what we find in @xmath8-body simulations for the bolshoi @xmath2 model with @xmath52 @xcite . in short , there seems to be no contradiction between our results and @xcite even when we consider models with standard adiabatic contraction .",
    "more definite conclusions require careful analysis and changes in the fraction of cold baryons among other things .",
    "in this paper we address one of the most difficult problems in cosmology : is the standard cosmological @xmath2 model compatible with observations when it comes to the prediction of the abundance and properties of galaxies ? instead of focusing on traditional issues such as the zero - point and the slope of the tully - fisher relation for spiral galaxies , we work with a more generic luminosity - velocity ( lv ) relation : a correlation of galaxy luminosity with the circular velocity at a 10  kpc radius",
    ". we also investigate the ( cold ) baryonic mass - velocity relation , which following tradition we call the baryonic tully - fisher ( btf ) relation , as well as the velocity function and the two - point autocorrelation function of galaxies .",

    "our models fit the observed luminosity and stellar mass functions .",

    "in addition , in this paper we show that halo abundance matching also yields the correct clustering properties of bright galaxies .",
    "in short , _ we have a model , that fits  at least on average  all the basic statistics of galaxies with @xmath0 considered at a @xmath110  kpc scale_.    matching theory with observations requires a careful consideration of many different effects and application of different corrections .",
    "these effects were considered both for observations and for the theory . on the observational side , we compiled a representative sample of galaxies with measured circular velocities .",

    "we do not apply morphological corrections of the tf relation ( e.g. , differences between sb and sa galaxies ) because those corrupt the bright end of the lv relation .",
    "since the tully - fisher luminosities are corrected to face - on , we de - correct the magnitudes of galaxies for the effect of internal absorption to make them consistent with the measurement of the luminosity function .    for the theoretical predictions we try to make all the possible corrections to mimic the observational situation . for example , we do not use virial masses of halos because virial radii are too large compared with the typical distances at which rotational velocities of observed galaxies are measured .",
    "we do not assume a particular shape for the halo density profiles : they are measured directly in the simulations .",
    "the simulations required for this type of analysis should have a very high resolution so that subhalos are also resolved .",
    "this allows us to avoid using intermediate steps such as the halo occupation distribution or the conditional luminosity function , which are often applied to low - resolution simulations .",
    "the bolshoi cosmological simulation @xcite provides high quality results resolving distinct halos and subhalos down to the completeness limit of @xmath224 .",
    "the observations should be taken cautiously since each has a different degree of accuracy .",

    "the completeness of the hipass vf is very uncertain .",
    "just the fact that the detection limit is quoted at @xmath190 shows that the accuracy of the hi mass function is not very high .",
    "this is why we treat the results on the velocity function for @xmath0 as a `` pass '' for the theory in spite of some deviations such as at @xmath225 .",
    "more accurate treatment of these gas - rich galaxies may also change the situation : after all , changes in abundances and velocities by @xmath226 may ( or may not ) resolve the discrepancies .",

    "@xcite argue that warm dark matter may be the solution to the problem .",
    "we introduce a simple scatter model that is well motivated and preserves the agreement with the lv relation and the correlation function of galaxies in the sdss .",
    "the introduction of scatter has some complications .",
    "observed deviations from the median relations seem to have a systematic component : early - type galaxies are systematically below the median lv relation and gas - rich spirals are above it .",

    ", no simple gaussian spread can explain the whole diagram .",
    "however uncertain , the spread must be explained .",
    "one approach might be to match halos separately to red and blue galaxies , for example using local density as well as luminosity .",

    "abundance matching is a very successful way to make predictions about how on average galaxies can inhabit dark matter halos .",
    "it gives up solving the most difficult and the most important problem : how galaxies form inside dark matter halos .",
    "it simply assumes that the stellar mass and luminosity monotonically ( or possibly with some scatter ) scale with the circular velocity . bluntly speaking",
    ", it assumes that the maximum circular velocity of a halo determines the properties of the galaxy hosted by that halo .",
    "remarkably , this can reproduce some basic environmental relations such as the morphology - density relation and the dependence of galaxy clustering on the luminosity of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because of the correlation of environment with the average halo mass @xcite . however , there are potential issues with abundance matching .",

    "in this paper we have shown that our model is successful at this task . simultaneously reproducing the luminosity function and the lv relation depends critically on implementing each of the steps in section  [ sec : procedure ] to obtain the properties of the galaxies that inhabit @xmath2 halos .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig : lv4 ] shows how assuming an incorrect value for the baryon fraction ( as in @xcite ) can lead to an lv relation that is in striking disagreement with the observations . in the more recent semi - analytic model of @xcite the circular velocities of galaxies are @xmath228 larger than observed at any luminosity",
    "this may be explained by the fact that their baryon fraction is about @xmath114 larger than ours for milky way - mass galaxies and about an order of magnitude larger than our result for the most massive ellipticals as well as dwarfs .",

    "here is a short summary of our results :    * in combination with previous results , we conclude that the standard @xmath2 model in conjunction with halo abundance matching can simultaneously fit reasonably well the main global statistics of galaxies : the luminosity function , the stellar mass function , the luminosity - velocity relation , the baryonic tully - fisher relation , the abundance of galaxies with circular velocities @xmath0 , as well as the clustering properties of bright galaxies as a function of luminosity .",

    ", we check whether there is any unassigned luminosity which is more than 3-@xmath56 brighter than @xmath234 .",
    "if such unassigned value exists , the next halo in the list is assigned to it .",
    "since we are stepping along the list of luminosities as we assign them , the process is intrinsically asymmetric and there will always be some leftover @xmath231 values that get assigned in this step .",
    "the offset used in step 1 ensures that these make up only a few percent of the sample .",
    "repeat steps 2 - 5 for each halo in the ordered list until the 3-@xmath56 faint tail of the gaussian for a given halo reaches the completeness limit of the sample as defined in section  [ sec : sim ] .",
    "the procedure is stopped at this point to prevent placing a hard constraint on the faint end of the lf where it is most uncertain .",
    "the faintest halos ( up to 0.5 magnitudes brighter than the cutoff ) are removed from the sample to insure the preservation of the lf throughout .    in spite of the fact that a constant gaussian distribution is used in the algorithm ,",
    "the final distribution of @xmath231 for a given circular velocity @xmath36 is not a gaussian and the width of the @xmath237 relation is not constant .",
    "this happens because of the asymmetry in the distribution of the galaxies : there are always more galaxies with smaller luminosities than with larger ones .",
    "thus , the distribution and the spread of the final @xmath237 relation are the result of a convolution of a gaussian distribution with the luminosity function .",
    "the effect of the asymmetry of the lf is more pronounced for the brightest galaxies in the sample and accounts for the small shift in the median compared to the monotonic assignment .",
    "the algorithm also gives a natural narrowing of the distribution of luminosities as @xmath36 increases .",
    "this occurs because in the exponential tail of the lf the number of available @xmath231 values changes rapidly across the width of the gaussian . increasingly fewer available values on the bright side of the median force the selection of most values to take place in a narrower interval on the faint side .",
    "since our assignment method reduces the width of the obtained distribution of luminosities , we choose the input value @xmath238 .",
    "this yields a distribution with @xmath168 below @xmath239 and gradually decreasing to @xmath212 above @xmath240 .",
    "figure  [ fig : scatter1 ] shows the distribution of luminosities in four bins of circular velocity , @xmath35 . below @xmath241 , galaxies show a near - normal distribution that is centered very close to the values obtained from the monotonic assignment without scatter . for @xmath242",
    "the distributions get progressively more skewed as galaxies move from the bright to the faint tail .",
    "the spread of the distribution of luminosities increases with @xmath36 : the widths are @xmath243 , @xmath244 , @xmath245 and @xmath246 for the bins centered at @xmath247 , @xmath248 , @xmath249 and @xmath250 respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : lv6 ] shows the lv relation obtained with the scatter model of @xcite in the case of constant scatter ( left panel ) as well as assuming the same variable width used in our model : @xmath211 for @xmath251 declining to @xmath252 for larger @xmath36 .",
    "evidently , the median of the distribution in luminosity stays relatively unchanged only when forcing a small scatter width at the bright end .",
    "even when we impose the same variable width used in the stochastic ham scheme , the resulting spread is too large for the brightest galaxies .",
    "table  [ table : etgdata ] gives some of the properties of our early - type sample along with the source of data for each galaxy .",
