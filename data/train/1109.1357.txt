    "superconducting films with periodic arrays of artificial pinning sites have been extensively studied for a long time.@xcite it is found that at the fields where the number of superconducting flux quantum @xmath3 in unit area is an integer multiple of the pinning sites , the so called commensurate effects such as peaks in the @xmath4 and dips in the @xmath0 curves can be observed.@xcite the most prevailing explanation for these effects is that the vortex lattice is commensurate with the underlying array and pinned efficiently at the matching fields .",
    "however , similar phenomena have also been observed in other systems including superconducting wire networks and josephson junction arrays.@xcite in wire networks , when the magnetic flux through single plaquette does not equal to integer multiple of @xmath5 , supercurrents must be induced along the loops to satisfy the fluxoid quantization condition .",
    "there is an energy cost due to the induced supercurrents and thus results in a reduced @xmath6 . from this point of view , in wire networks , the resistance oscillations are caused by @xmath6 suppression at non - matching fields rather than enhanced pinning at the matching fields.@xcite interestingly , transitions from the pinning regime to the wire network regime can be observed in some superconducting film with pinning arrays .",
    "for example , with increasing hole diameter , the width of the strips between neighboring holes in a hole array becomes comparable to the coherence length at temperatures close to @xmath7 ( zero resistance transition temperature ) and the system behaves like a wire network.@xcite     +    we notice that these findings are based on square@xcite and triangular@xcite lattices . in those cases , with small edge - to - edge separation , the remaining geometrical structures of the patterned films , are indeed like wire networks with uniform width and small nodes .",
    "thus the transition from pining array to wire network is straightforward .",
    "however , other series of hole arrays with large hole diameter may not have such direct geometrical simplification .",
    "investigations of those hole arrays are needed to better understand the physics related to superconductors with micro / nano structures .    in this work ,",
    "superconducting nb films with honeycomb and kagom arrays of holes are studied .",
    "the arrays can be viewed as diluted triangular arrays , for they can be constructed with 1/3 and 1/4 of the sites removed form the original lattice , respectively.@xcite the edge - to - edge separations between neighboring holes in these samples are comparable to the coherence length at temperature close to @xmath7 . even though , unlike square and triangular arrays , the patterned films still have large interstitial regions .",
    "this distinct character makes the system different from wire networks , for in ideal wire networks , both the width of the stripes and the radius of the nodes are smaller than the coherence length and a uniform order parameter in the cross section of any stripe is expected",
    ". large interstitial regions , on the other hand , can facilitate the nucleation of abrikosov vortices@xcite , resulting in the appearance of normal cores . in our experiments , a series of minima",
    "are observed in the @xmath0 curves .",
    "while the oscillation period at low fields is in good agreement with the value derived from the hole density , the periodicity in higher fields is much larger .",
    "it is found that the transition of the two regions is due to the presence of interstitial vortices in the high field region .",
    "surprisingly , in the low field region , wire network behaviors are observed in both samples .",
    "we identify the wire network behavior by the fractional matchings ( fine structures ) in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 curves .",
    "the positions and the relative values of the matching minima are studied in detail .",
    "we notice that the connectivity of a wire network determines the characters of the fine structures , therefore we highlight the connectivity of our hole arrays and simplify each of them to a wire network .",
    "the comparison of the results in the holes arrays with those of their corresponding wire networks , including reported experimental data as well as calculation results based on the alexander model,@xcite demonstrates that the hole arrays studied in this work are well described by wire networks when subjected to small field .",
    "the nano - structured superconducting films were prepared as follows .",
    "first , the superconducting nb film with a thickness of 100  nm was deposited by magnetron sputtering on si substrate with sio@xmath8 buffer layer .",
    "next , a micro - bridge for four terminal transport measurement was fabricated by ultraviolet photolithography followed by reactive ion etching",
    ". then the desired arrays covering the whole bridge area of @xmath9m@xmath10 was patterned by electron - beam lithography on a polymethyl metacrylate ( pmma ) resist layer .",
    "finally , the pattern was transferred to the nb film by magnetically enhanced reactive ion etching . in both the honeycomb and kagom samples ,",
    "the value of the center - to - center distance between nearest neighbor ( @xmath11 ) is 400  nm and the hole diameter ( @xmath12 ) is about 340  nm .",
    "the scanning electron micrograph image of the kagom sample is shown in fig .",
    "[ semkagome ] .",
    "the smallest width of the stripes between the adjacent holes is about 60  nm .",
    "the transport measurements were carried out in a commercial physical properties measurement system ( ppms ) manufactured by quantum design .",
    "the magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the film surface . during the measurements , the temperature stability was better than 2  mk .",
    "the zero field transition temperatures @xmath13 are 8.713  k for the honeycomb sample and 8.755  k for the kagom sample , using a criterion of half the normal state resistance @xmath14 at 9  k , which are 8.18  @xmath15 and 9.02  @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the transition width of these two samples is about 0.15  k. the reference film without any pattern has a slightly higher @xmath16 of 8.87  k and transition width of 50  mk .",
    "we have measured the @xmath17 phase boundary of the reference sample and obtained the zero - temperature coherence length @xmath18  nm.@xcite",
    "figure  [ rhhoneycomb ] shows the @xmath0 curve measured at 8.55  k with a current of 50  @xmath19a .",
    "a series of local minima and maxima are observed . among these , seven integer matching minima can be clearly identified .",
    "the field interval between two consecutive integer minima versus the corresponding index number are shown in the inset . at fields below 300  oe , the observed intervals are about 96.5  oe",
    ", is in agreement with the value 99.6  oe derived from the hole density .",
    "when the field is larger than the third matching field , the field spacing has a larger value of about 146.5  oe .",
    "this value is very close to the matching field of a triangular lattice with the same lattice constant which is 149.4  oe . one exception is that the spacing between the 4th and 5th minima is 100  oe .     curve of nb film with honeycomb array of holes measured at 8.55  k with a current of 50  @xmath19a .",

    "[ rhkagome ] , the field intervals have two sets of values too .",
    "the field intervals of the first three minima are about 108.7  oe , again in good agreement with the first matching field ( @xmath20112.1  oe ) of the underlying kagom lattice .",

    "thus , abrikosov vortices can be easily accommodated by the interstitial sites .",
    "form the field spacing values between two consecutive integer matchings , the overall feature of the @xmath0 curves can be explained as follows .",
    "when the field is small , supercurrents are generated around the holes in order to satisfy the fluxoid quantization condition . at the integer matching field , it is the arrangement of the fluxoids that is commensurate with the hole lattice . when the applied magnetic field is larger than the third matching field , abrikosov vortices are generated in the interstitial region to minimize the free energy.@xcite these interstitial vortices are effectively pinned by the repulsive interactions from the fluxoids in the holes , which create a caging potential.@xcite the overall flux lattice , which is composed of interstitial vortices and the fluxoids in the holes , would have a triangular symmetry .",
    "that is why the field intervals of the minima observed in high field region in both lattices are in good agreement with the value derived form a vortex lattice with triangular arrangement . the saturation number @xmath21 , namely , the maximum number of fluxoids trapped by one hole without the entry of interstitial vortices are three in both samples .",
    "this value exceeds the limit @xmath22 given by mkrtchyan and schmidt,@xcite where @xmath12 is the diameter of the defect and @xmath23 is the temperature dependent coherence length .",
    "this fact indicates that the proximity of the holes is prominent.@xcite    however , the exact vortex configurations and their evolution are strongly dependent on the density of flux quanta and the confinement of the mesoscopic structure . both image experiment @xcite and",
    "simulation @xcite have revealed the complex nature and the transition process between various configurations of the composite vortex lattice .",
    "this may also responsible for the observation of a field interval of 100  oe between the 4th and 5th minima in fig .",

    "[ transform ] , the centers of the interstitial regions are regarded as nodes . then , the superconducting stripes between neighboring holes are viewed as wires ( dotted lines ) connecting the nodes . following this procedure ,",

    "the fine structures are more pronounced in @xmath0 than in @xmath35 vs @xmath36 .",
    "this is because the resistance is measured at temperatures slightly above @xmath7 in the superconducting transition region where resistance drops sharply with decreasing temperature , a small change in @xmath6 will result in an enhanced effect in resistance , and thus a more pronounced commensurate effect .    to our knowledge ,",
    "fractional matching effects in honeycomb arrays have only been observed at @xmath34 1/2 in previous studies.@xcite at the typical measuring temperature @xmath38 8.6k ( 0.987 @xmath6 ) in this work , @xmath39 86.9  nm is slightly larger than the width of the narrow stripes .",
    "this fact makes the samples investigated here be qualitatively different from those in previous works on hole arrays and be better described as wire networks .",
    "rich structures in the @xmath1 curves of wire networks may serve as fingerprints to differentiate one array from another , since for a given geometry the fine structures are only expected at a particular series of filling ratios.@xcite from the linearized ginzburg - landau equations , alexander had derived the relation of the order parameters at the nodes subjected to non - integer flux.@xcite based on those equations , the task of finding the field dependent transition temperature is reduced to eigenvalue problems .",

    "the fine structures of the @xmath1 of triangular wire network have also been studied by analytical approach based on multiple - loop aharonov - bohm feynman path integrals.@xcite the main features in @xmath1 such as the position and relative strength of the most prominent dips are the same as those in the alexander s treatment .",
    "the most pronounced dips occur at @xmath34 1/4 , 1/3 , 1/2 etc . , in good agreement with the experimental data . at the fields where",
