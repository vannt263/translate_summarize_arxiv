    "twenty five years after the discovery of high t@xmath0 superconductivity ( sc ) in the cuprates , none of the proposed scenarios have led to a consistent mechanism of this phenomenon .",
    "it is now recognized that there exist many other superconductors in which electron - electron ( e - e ) interactions are repulsive .",
    "one approach to arriving at the theory of correlated - electron sc is to determine the common characteristics shared by different families of correlated - electron superconductors . once such common features are determined",
    ", one could ask what the implications of these features are for the mechanism of sc .",
    "it is with this goal we report and explain the strong parallels between conducting organic charge - transfer solids ( cts ) and layered cobaltates .",
    "both families have been compared individually to the cuprates .",
    "resonating valence bond ( rvb ) theories of sc have in the past been proposed for both quasi-2d @xmath1-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2x @xcite and the layered hydrated cobaltate na@xmath3coo@xmath2",
    "@xmath4 @xmath5h@xmath2o , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "our description here uses the carrier concentration @xmath7 , rather than the bandfilling . in the cts",
    ", @xmath7 is the charge per individual molecule .",
    "the charge carriers in the cts occupy the highest molecular orbitals of the molecules , which act as single sites .",
    "the layered cobaltates , - na@xmath3coo@xmath2 , li@xmath3coo@xmath2 and k@xmath3coo@xmath2 - consist of coo@xmath2 layers separated by layers of alkali ions .",
    "the co ions form a triangular lattice and have average charge ( 4-@xmath8)+ . the large crystal field splitting @xcite leads to low - spin states for the co - ions , and the co@xmath9 ( co@xmath10 ) ions are spinless ( spin @xmath11 . )",
    "trigonal distortion splits the @xmath12 @xmath13-orbitals on the co ions further into two low - lying @xmath14 orbitals and a higher @xmath15 orbital , and photoemission studies of na@xmath3coo@xmath2 suggest that the charge carrying holes on the co@xmath10 ions occupy the @xmath15 orbitals only @xcite . _",
    "note that the hole density @xmath16 here . _    in both families @xmath7 can be tuned over wide ranges .",
    "we briefly describe the experimental observations , and then present a consistent theory of the _ systematic _ @xmath7-dependence in the two apparently unrelated families . following this",
    "we point out that sc in the cts and the cobaltates may be occurring at the same @xmath17 .",
    "given the strong role of carrier concentration in both families , this can not be a coincidence .",
    "there exist other inorganic materials where also sc is limited to the same @xmath7 .",
    "a correct theory of correlated - electron sc should explain this shared feature .",
    "in the quasi-1d cts @xmath7 ranges from 0.5 to 1 .",
    "the @xmath18 materials are mott - hubbard semiconductors @xcite .",
    "experimental signatures of strong correlations in the @xmath19 conductors are , ( i ) magnetic susceptibility @xmath20 enhanced relative to the calculated pauli susceptibility @xmath21 , and ( ii ) 4k@xmath22 instability . _ structurally similar 1d conductors , with nearly identical molecular components and crystal structures , exhibit very different behavior . _",
    "thus @xmath23 is @xmath24 20 in mem(tcnq)@xmath2 , @xmath25 in ttf - tcnq , and @xmath26 in hmtsf - tcnq @xcite .",
    "the 4k@xmath22 transition temperature @xmath27k in mem(tcnq)@xmath2 @xcite , but considerably lower in ttf - tcnq @xcite .",
    "hmtsf - tcnq shows no 4k@xmath22 instability and only the `` normal '' 2k@xmath22 instability @xcite .",
    "these observations had led to various `` large u '' and `` small u '' hubbard model - based theories with , however , no understanding why u could be both large and small .",
    "more recently , the emphasis has been on the 4k@xmath22 charge - ordering in 2:1 cationic cts @xcite .",
    "@xmath20 in na@xmath3coo@xmath2 is strongly @xmath8-dependent .",
    "early work @xcite labeled @xmath20 as `` pauli paramagnetic '' for @xmath28 ( large @xmath7 ) and `` curie - weiss '' for @xmath29 ( small @xmath7 ) .",
    "more recent works label the small @xmath8 ( large @xmath8 ) materials as `` weakly '' ( `` strongly '' ) correlated , and put the boundary between these close to @xmath30 instead of 0.5 @xcite .",
    "thermopower measurements give similar results .",
    "early theories ascribed the @xmath8-dependence of the electronic behavior in na@xmath3coo@xmath2 to na - ion potentials .",
    "experiments @xcite that have established identical @xmath8-dependence in li@xmath3coo@xmath2 with much smaller li - ions and in the incommensurate misfit cobaltates show that the behavior is intrinsic to the coo@xmath2 layers .",
    "weakly correlated behavior for systems with @xmath7 close to 1 , - which for large enough @xmath31 would be a mott - hubbard semiconductor , - and strongly correlated behavior for small @xmath7 , where the system is closest to being a band insulator with all co - ions as spinless co@xmath9,- are both counterintuitive .",
    "weak correlation has sometimes been ascribed to greater mixing of @xmath15 and @xmath32 orbitals , but it is not clear why such mixing should be @xmath8-dependent .",
    "the problems in understanding the @xmath7-dependence arise from limiting discussions of e - e interactions to the simple hubbard model , with the onsite repulsion @xmath31 as the only significant coulomb interaction .",
    "the simple hubbard model provides a good description of the ground state and the low energy spin excitations for @xmath18 , where the effects of longer range coulomb interactions can be incorporated with an effective onsite interaction @xmath33 ( with only short range nearest neighbor ( nn ) repulsion @xmath34 , @xmath35 . )",
    "this effective parametrization breaks down for @xmath36 .",
    "we demonstrate that the observed @xmath7-dependence in both cts and cobaltates can be understood very well within the extended hubbard hamiltonian provided @xmath31 is _ finite _ and @xmath37 is nonnegligible .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian , @xmath38 for both the cts and the cobaltates . in",
    "the above @xmath39 imply nn , the fermion operator @xmath40 creates an electron or a hole with spin @xmath41 ( @xmath42 or @xmath43 ) on a cts molecular site , and a hole in the triangular lattice of co - ions in the layered cobaltates .",
    "all other terms have their usual meanings . in the following",
    "we express all energies in units of @xmath44 . as discussed in section 2 ,",
    "the susceptibility relative to the pauli susceptibility is the most used measure of the degree of correlation .",
    "since calculations of thermodynamic quantities can be done only with relatively small number of electrons , we choose to calculate the normalized probability of double occupancy in the ground state , @xmath45 which can be calculated for much larger system size .",
    "explicit calculations of @xmath46 @xcite and susceptibility @xcite indicate that small ( large ) @xmath46 is both necessary and sufficient for enhanced ( unenhanced ) susceptibility .",
    "the physical reason for this is that the reduction of hubbard hamiltonians to the heisenberg spin hamiltonian requires @xmath47 , while large @xmath46 implies metallic behavior .",
    "we have performed exact numerical calculations of @xmath48 .",
    "our previous 1d calculations @xcite were with different system sizes for different @xmath7 .",
    "substantive improvements in computer capabilities in the intervening years now allow us to vary @xmath7 keeping the same number of sites @xmath49 .",
    "our calculations are for periodic rings of @xmath50 . in fig .  1 we have plotted @xmath48 against @xmath7 for @xmath51 , @xmath52 , 2 and 3 .",
    "the value of @xmath31 chosen is realistic for cts @xcite .",
    "although @xmath53 systems do not exist here we have retained one such a point for comparison to the 2d calculations below .",
    "the key points of fig .",
    "1 are : ( i ) for @xmath52 correlation effects are nearly independent of @xmath7 , ( ii ) for @xmath54 , correlations are strongest for materials near @xmath17 , and ( iii ) materials with @xmath7 between @xmath24 0.67 - 0.9 should exhibit weakest correlations .",
    "our calculations in 2d are for six different finite periodic triangular lattices , with @xmath49=12 , 16 18 and 20 ( two different 16-site and 20-site lattices each can be constructed ) @xcite . here",
    "we report results for the @xmath49=16 and 20-site lattices shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the corresponding plots for @xmath48 , for the same @xmath31 and @xmath34 as in fig .  1 , are shown in figs .",
    "2(c ) and ( d ) , respectively .",
    "these @xmath31 and @xmath34 were arrived at from experiments @xcite .",
    "importantly , @xmath7-dependent @xmath48 in either 1d or 2d is not found in the @xmath55 limit , where @xmath56 for all @xmath7 .",
    "finite @xmath31 and @xmath34 are both required @xcite .",
    "the natures of the plots for the two different lattice sizes are very similar : ( a ) @xmath48 is nearly @xmath7-independent for @xmath52 , ( b ) is small for @xmath57 for @xmath58 , and ( c ) fairly large in the region @xmath59 for significant @xmath34 .",
    "in particular , @xmath34 decreases @xmath48 in the region @xmath57 but enhances it for larger @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath60 in the triangular lattice thus corresponds to @xmath17 in 1d .",
    "2 predicts that 1d systems with @xmath17 and realistic @xmath34 are the most strongly correlated , and the effective correlations decrease with increasing @xmath7 , until about @xmath61 beginning from where the effective correlations increase again .",
    "precisely such a systematic @xmath7-dependent behavior is seen in the entire cts family @xcite . among the three cts mentioned above , ( i ) mem(tcnq)@xmath2 exhibits very strongly correlated behavior because it is @xmath17 , where @xmath48 is the smallest ; ( ii ) ttf - tcnq with intermediate @xmath62 exhibits moderately strongly correlated behavior , with @xmath48 still smaller than that at @xmath18 ; ( iii ) the weakly correlated behavior of hmtsf - tcnq with @xmath63 is expected , since @xmath48 here close to being largest ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "recent discovery of 4k@xmath22 charge ordering in the ( tmttf)@xmath2x @xcite and the accompanying theoretical discussions @xcite are in agreement with these conclusions .",
    "thus weakly and strongly correlated behavior can both emerge in spite of having the same @xmath31 and @xmath34 .    figs .",
    "2(c ) and ( d ) predict that correlation effects in the triangular lattice are strongest for @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) , and that the boundary between strongly and moderately correlated regions occurs at @xmath66 asymmetry between @xmath60 and @xmath67 is predicted , with @xmath68 predicted to show weakly correlated behavior . in the @xmath69",
    "limit @xmath70 charge - ordering is expected in both cases @xcite .",
    "our predictions are in strong agreement with observations in na@xmath3coo@xmath2 , li@xmath3coo@xmath2 and the misfit cobaltates @xcite . here",
    "we have ignored the @xmath32 orbitals .",
    "elsewhere @xcite we have shown that the two - band extended ( but not simple ) hubbard hamiltonian explains the weak @xmath32 hole occupancy near @xmath71 , also in agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "sc in correlated - electron superconductors invariably occurs over a narrow range of carrier concentration , and sometimes the superconducting substance is a line compound .",
    "the latter is true with superconducting cts , which are 2:1 cationic compounds ( @xmath72 hole carriers ) or 1:2 anionic compounds ( @xmath72 electron carriers ) .",
    "we find this significant , given the strong @xmath7-dependence of the electronic behavior and the natural explanation of the same within the extended hubbard model . beyond this ,",
    "superconducting cts are quasi-2d with strong interstack interactions .",
    "highest t@xmath0 is reached in the @xmath1-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2x , in which the superconducting state is often proximate to an antiferromagnetic state . the @xmath1-lattice is strongly dimerized , and the dimer unit cells form an anisotropic triangular lattice .",
    "theoretical explanation of the antiferromagnetism requires that the dimer lattice be thought of as _ effective _ @xmath18 , with each dimer as a single site .",
    "this is what has led to to the rvb theories of sc within the @xmath18 hubbard hamiltonian on an anisotropic triangular lattice @xcite . within these models increasing pressure increases frustration as well as bandwidth , and",
    "sc appears at the interface of antiferromagnetism and metallicity .",
    "this idea , though attractive , is incorrect .",
    "there is no sc within the @xmath18 hubbard hamiltonian for any @xmath31 or anisotropy @xcite .",
    "importantly , there exist many cts in which the superconducting transition is from an insulating state _ different _ from antiferromagnetism , or where the triangular lattice of monomers is not dimerized , which would also argue against any mechanism based on the @xmath18 hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "the only common features between cts superconductors are strong correlations , frustrated lattice of molecules , and @xmath17 .",
    "the hole density in the superconducting hydrated cobaltate is more elusive .",
    "the original assumption that the na - concentration determines the hole density also in the hydrated material has been found to be not true ; some water molecules enter as h@xmath73o@xmath74 , and the actual @xmath7 in the superconductor is much smaller than the 0.65 that would be guessed from the na - concentration",
    ". there have been several reports that sc occurs over a very narrow range of hole density , and that maximum t@xmath0 occurs at or very close to co - ion valency 3.5 + @xcite , corresponding to @xmath17 .    _",
    "the common features between all organic superconducting cts and the cobaltates then appear to be strong correlations , geometric lattice frustration and @xmath72 .",
    "_ yet another class of compounds that share these features are inorganic spinels ab@xmath2x@xmath75 .",
    "the b sublattice forms a frustrated pyrochlore lattice and usually consists of transition metal cations with partially filled t@xmath76 d - orbitals .",
    "only four of the many spinel compounds are superconducting , of which three have effective carrier density @xmath17 : liti@xmath2o@xmath75 , curh@xmath2s@xmath75 , and curh@xmath2se@xmath75 . in liti@xmath2o@xmath75",
    "there is one d - electron per two ti@xmath77 ions .",
    "the rh@xmath77 ions , like co@xmath77 , are also @xmath17 .",
    "elsewhere we have shown that increased frustration within eq .",
    "1 leads to an antiferromagnetism - to - spin singlet charge - ordered transition in @xmath17 @xcite , and that this same spin - singlet state can undergo transition to a superconducting state with further increase in frustration @xcite .",
    "while further work on the proposed superconducting transition is required , the attractive features of this scenario are that the peculiar @xmath7-dependence of the above diverse materials are explained within eq .  1 ,",
    "and the possibility exists that sc can be explained within a single plausible mechanism .",
