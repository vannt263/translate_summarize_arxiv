    "further , the geometrical critical phenomenon of percolation @xcite and , recently , the cooperative behavior of interacting degrees of freedom on random scale - free networks @xcite has enjoyed his thorough attention . in this paper",
    ", we discuss a subtle variant of a percolation process on scale - free graphs of bipartite structure .    in recent decades ,",
    "a detailed analysis of many real - life structures revealed the existence of a common property .",
    "studies of social , technological and biological networks have indicated that the probability distribution @xmath4 of the degree @xmath0 of a node , i.e. , the number of links attached to the node , follows a decreasing power law @xmath5 for large values of @xmath0 . notable examples of such so - called scale - free networks are the network of co - authors of scientific articles , protein interaction networks , power grids and transportation networks .",
    "an accurate determination of the topological exponent ( or  degree exponent \" ) @xmath6 in real - life networks is far from easy , but most studies indicate a value of @xmath6 in the range @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "most properties of scale - free networks are determined by the existence of a small number of nodes which have a large number of links , commonly called hubs .",
    "an important consequence of the existence of these hubs is the resilience of the network against random removal of links or nodes .",
    "such destruction processes are studied in the percolation problem , which mostly focusses on the behavior of the largest cluster in the network if links or nodes are removed .",
    "when all links and nodes are present in a ( infinite ) network , a finite fraction of nodes will belong to the largest or  giant \" cluster .",
    "however , when more and more links are removed , a point will be reached at which the fraction of nodes contained in the giant cluster vanishes .",
    "this point , which shows all characteristics of a second - order phase transition , is called the percolation transition . if the breakdown of the giant cluster occurs when a _ finite _ fraction of links is still present in the network as a whole , the network is called _",
    "fragile_. however , if after the removal of an arbitrary fraction of links the giant cluster is still present , the network is called _ robust_.    studies of percolation on scale - free networks have revealed that the behavior of the giant cluster depends on the topological exponent @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath8 , the giant cluster breaks down at a finite fraction of links , thus the network is fragile .",
    "however , when @xmath9 , the network is robust .",
    "most real - life networks are thus robust against random removal of links . among the numerous applications , the percolation problem has for instance been studied as a model for failures in the internet structure and in terrorist networks  @xcite , or as a model for virus spreading on social networks  @xcite .",
    "not all networks can be described using a single type of vertex .",
    "for instance , the network of hetero - sexual contacts can best be modeled by two types of vertices , men and women , where links always run between nodes of unlike type .",
    "such networks are called _ bipartite",
    "networks_. they appear in many social structures , for instance in affiliation networks , i.e. , networks of individuals joined by common membership of communities .",
    "the two types of vertices then represent the individuals and the groups , while the links between them indicate group membership  @xcite .",
    "one could for instance model the research interests of physicists : the first type of nodes then represents the researchers , while the second type of nodes consists of the research topics ( for instance classified according to the pacs ) .",
    "most studies concerning bipartite networks focussed on the architecture and the building process of networks .",
    "this is for example the case for sexual - contact networks  @xcite , for listening habits and music genres  @xcite or for general affiliation networks  @xcite . among these studies",
    ", it was revealed that in many bipartite networks , the degree distribution of both types of nodes shows the scale - free characteristic , for instance in the hetero - sexual contacts network  @xcite .",
    "some studies also discuss the behavior of the network under random removal of its links or nodes  @xcite .    in recent work , random link removal on monopartite graphs",
    "was extended to _ biased percolation _ , in which links are removed according to the degree of their neighboring nodes  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , to each link is attached a weight @xmath10 where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the neighboring node degrees and @xmath3 is the bias exponent which we take to be positive ( and @xmath11 ) for our present purposes  @xcite . during the depreciation process , the probability to _ retain _ a link is proportional to the weight of the link .",
    "since @xmath12 , links between hubs are more prone to failure .",
    "therefore , the percolation process is called _ centrally biased_. such a process is inherent to many social networks , where friendships between people with many acquaintances are expected to be weaker and last less long than friendships involving people with few connections @xcite . in previous articles , refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , we showed that the critical behavior of such a biased percolation on a scale - free network can be mapped onto a random removal process on another scale - free network . more precisely , biased percolation with bias exponent @xmath13 on a network with topological exponent @xmath6 belongs to the same universality class as random percolation ( @xmath14 ) on a network with topological exponent @xmath15 , given by @xmath16 therefore , the network is , in the macroscopic limit , robust against biased removal of links as long as @xmath17 . if @xmath18",
