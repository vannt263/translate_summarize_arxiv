    "long - range dipolar interactions are at the heart of the explanation of many peculiar or anomalous phenomena observed in magnetic nanostructured materials . whereas in atomic magnetic materials",
    "the exchange interaction usually dominates over dipolar interactions , the opposite happens in many nanoscale particle or clustered magnetic systems , for which the interparticle interactions are mainly of dipolar origin .",
    "among the wide variety of artificially prepared systems containing nanosized magnetic clusters , some are particularly interesting for the study of the dipolar interaction in a controlled manner . among them",
    ", we have granular metal solids consisting of fine magnetic particles embedded in a nonmagnetic matrix , in this case , for insulating matrices ( for which rkky interactions are absent ) , the dipolar interaction between the granules dominates over exchange via tunneling mechanisms @xcite . in these materials ,",
    "the interactions can be tuned because the metal volume fraction and average size of the granules can be varied in a controlled way .",
    "frozen ferrofluids consisting of nanosized magnetic particles dispersed in a carrier liquid have also been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "these are considered as experimental models of random magnet systems and , in this case , the strength of the interactions can be tuned easily by controlling the concentration of particles in the ferrofluid .    in systems with reduced dimensionality , the effects of dipolar interactions are even more relevant since they allow the existence of long - range ordered phases at low temperature @xcite . among two dimensional systems ,",
    "we find patterned media composed by regular arrays of nanoelements @xcite of different shapes and self - ordered magnetic arrays of nanoparticles @xcite , both of potential use in ultra - high density magnetic storage . in this kind of materials ,",
    "interparticle interactions have to be prepared with a high control over the size , shape and interparticle distances in order to minimize the interparticle interactions since they could induce demagnetization of the stored information @xcite .",
    "finally , dipolar interations has proven to be essential to elucidate the ferromagnetic order and hysteresis of one - dimensional structures such as nanostripes @xcite , monoatomic metal chains @xcite , nanowires @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "they also play a crucial role in the quantum relaxation phenomena of molecular clusters @xcite .",
    "while dilute systems are well understood , experimental results for dense systems are still a matter of controversy .",
    "some of their peculiar magnetic properties have been attributed to dipolar interactions although many of the issues are still object of debate . different experimental results measuring the same physical quantities give contradictory results and theoretical explanations are many times inconclusive or unclear , in what follows we briefly outline the main subjects to be clarified .",
    "the complexity of dipolar interactions and the frustration provided by the randomness in particle positions and anisotropy axes directions present in highly concentrated ferrofluids seem enough ingredients to create a collective glassy dynamics in these kind of systems .",
    "experiments probing the relaxation of the thermoremanent magnetization @xcite have evidenced magnetic aging and studies of the dynamic and nonlinear susceptibilities @xcite also find evidence of a critical behaviour typical of a spin - glass - like freezing .",
    "all these studies have attributed this collective spin - glass behaviour to dipolar interactions , although surface exchange may also be at the origin of this phenomenon .",
    "however , mc simulations of a system of interacting monodomain particles @xcite show that , while the dependence of zfc / fc curves on interaction and cooling rate are reminiscent of a spin glass transition at @xmath1 , the relaxational behaviour is not in accordance with the picture of cooperative freezing .",
    "moreover , it is still not clear what is the dependence of the blocking temperature and remanent magnetization with concentration , @xmath2 , in ferrofluids : while most experiments @xcite , find an increase of @xmath1 and a decrease of @xmath3 with @xmath2 , others @xcite observe the contrary variation in similar systems .",
    "finally , for disordered systems , the dipolar interaction ususally diminishes the coercive field @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present the results of monte carlo simulations of a model of a system of nanoparticles simple enough to capture the main features observed in experiments . in particular",
    ", we will show that the spin - glass phenomenology described above is present even in a simple model consisting of a spin chain with dipolar interactions and disordered anisotropy easy - axes as the only ingredients .",
    "for this purpose , we present the results of simulations of the time dependendence of the magnetization for different values of the strenght of the dipolar interaction and temperatures . with the aim to establish a connection between the microscopic energy landscape of the magnetic system and the observed relaxation laws",
    ", we will present an extension of the @xmath4 scaling method to systems with dipolar interactions that allows us to extract the distribution of energy barriers and of dipolar fields responsible for the relaxation from the relaxation curves .",
    "the model considered consists of a linear chain of @xmath5 classical heisenberg spins @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , each one representing a monodomain particle with magnetic moment @xmath8 . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ t7_1dpart_fig ] , spins have random uniaxial anisotropy @xmath9 , and anisotropy constants @xmath10 , distributed according to a distribution function @xmath11 which we will take as a lognormal @xmath12 of width @xmath13 and mean value @xmath14 .",
    "the spins interact via dipolar long - ranged interactions and with an external homogeneous magnetic field @xmath15 pointing along the direction perpendicular to the chain .",
    "spins are meant to represent the total magnetic moment of the particle , so that we will not take into account the internal structure of the particle .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian can be written then as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 characterizes the strength of the dipolar interaction and @xmath18 is the distance separating spins @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the lattice spacing , here chosen as @xmath22 .    the direction of the spin vectors will be restricted to lie in the @xmath23 plane and therefore particles are characterized by the angles @xmath24 .",
    "this choice has been taken because only in this case exact values of the minima of the energy function and the respective energy barriers can be conputed exactly",
    ". finally , periodic boundary conditions along the chain are considerd , so that we get rid of the possibility of spin reversal at the boundaries of the system because of the reduced coordination there . in what follows",
    ", temperature will be measured in reduced units @xmath25 .",
    "the effect of the dipolar interaction can be more easily understood by defining the dipolar fields acting on each spin @xmath19 ( see fig .",
    "[ t7_1dpart_fig ] ) @xmath26 therefore , rewriting the dipolar energy as @xmath27 the total energy of the system can be expressed in the simple form @xmath28    now , the system can be thought as an ensemble of non - interacting spins feeling an effective field which is the sum of ans external and a locally changing dipolar field @xmath29 . note that the first term in eq .",
    "( [ hdip1 ] ) is a demagnetizing term since it is minimized when the spins are antiparallel , while the second one tends to align the spins parallel and along the direction of the chain . for systems of aligned",
    "ising spins only the first term is non - zero and , consequently , the dipolar field tends to induce af order along the direction of the chain ( the ground state configuration for this case ) .",
    "however , for heisenberg or planar spins , the competition between the two terms gives rise to frustrating interactions , which may induce other equilibrium configurations , depending on the interplay between anisotropy and dipolar energies .",
    "when considering heisenberg spins with a continuous degree of freedom @xmath30 , special care has to be taken in the way the trial steps are done @xcite .",
    "moreover , independently of the election of the trial step , there are different ways of implementing the monte carlo dynamics in this case , that differ essentially in how the energy difference @xmath31 appearing in the boltzmann probability is computed .",
    "either @xmath31 is computed as the energy difference between the current @xmath32 and the attempted @xmath33 values of the spin or it is chosen as the energy barrier which separates @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "note that the second choice gives @xmath31 s that are higher than the first if there is an energy maximum separating the two states .",
    "consequently , the time scale corresponding to one mc step depends crucially both on the trial step election and the chosen dynamics @xcite .",
    "since our major interest is to study the connection between the intrinsic energy barrier distributions and the long time relaxation of the magnetization , we have devised a mc algorithm that considers trial jumps only between orientations corresponding to energy minima randomly chosen with equal probabilities .",
    "the @xmath31 in the transition probability are always equal to one of the actual energy barriers of the system .",
    "this is possible because in the model considered the spins are restricted to point in the x - z plane and for this case it is possible to find the energy minima and maxima as well as the energy barriers separating them numerically since the energy of a particle can be rewritten as @xmath34 where the @xmath24 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the angles formed by the magnetic moment , anisotropy axis and effective field with respect to the z axis .",
    "although the energy barriers can not be analytically calculated for all the values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , it is not difficult to build up an algorithm that finds the minima and maxima of the energy function ( [ en1 ] ) and their respective energies @xcite . therefore , a mc step consists of the following steps : a spin is chosen at random , the energy barriers are computed following the above mentioned method , a trial jump is attempted and accepted with probability @xmath37 if @xmath38 or @xmath39 if @xmath40 , the dipolar fields @xmath41 acting on the other particles are recalculated and finally the whole process is repeated @xmath42 times .",

    "however , this configuration is highly metastable even at @xmath45 because , due to the randomness in anisotropy axes , the spins will not be pointing along the local energy minima directions . if the system is initially prepared in this way ( by the application of a strong external field , for example )",
    ", the spins will instantaneously reorient their magnetizations so that they lie along the nearest minimum .",
    "this accommodation process occurs in a time scale of the order of @xmath47 , much shorter than the thermal over - barrier relaxation times @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , in real experiments probing magnetization at time scales of the order of @xmath49 s ( _ i.e. _ squid magnetometry ) , this will not be observed . in order",
    "to get rid of this ultra - fast relaxation during the first steps of the simulations , we submit the system to a previous equilibration process at @xmath45 , during which the spins are consecutively placed in the nearest energy minima . since the dipolar field after each of this movements changes on all the spins , the energy minima positions change continuously , but , after a certain number of mc steps , the total magnetization stabilizes and the system reaches a final equilibrated state .",
    "the distribution energy barriers @xmath50 of these initial equilibrated configurations can be obtained by sampling the individual energy barriers of all the spins using the algorithm described in sec .",

    ", there are slight changes on the @xmath52 with respect to the non - interacting case . as in the case of an external homogeneous field @xcite ,",
    "the dipolar fields shift the peak of the distribution towards higher values , while its shape is unchanged . however , when increasing @xmath43 , the smallest energy barriers of particles having the smallest @xmath53 start to disappear .",
    "this leads to the appearance of a peak at zero energy , to an increase in the number of low energy barriers due to the reduction by the field , and also to the appearance of a longer tail at high energies .",
    "as the dipolar interaction is increased further ( @xmath54 ) , the original peak around @xmath55 is progressively suppressed as more barriers are destroyed , and a secondary subdistribution peaked at high energies appears as a consequence of barriers against rotation out of the effective field direction .",

    "[ t7_relax_log_fig ] for values of the interaction @xmath43 parameter ranging form the weak ( @xmath56 ) to the strong ( @xmath57 ) interaction regime .",
    "we observe that the stronger the interaction , the smaller the magnetization of the initial configuration due to the increasing strength of the local dipolar fields that tend to depart the equilibrium directions from the direction of the anisotropy axis .",
    "thus , we point out that , if relaxation curves for different @xmath43 at the same @xmath58 are to be compared , they have to be properly normalized by the corresponding @xmath59 value .",
    "as it is evidenced by the logarithmic time scale used in the figure , the relaxation is slowed down by the intrinsic frustration of the interaction and the randomness of the particle orientations .",
    "more remarkable is the fact that the stronger the interaction is , the magnetization decay is slower , which agrees well with the experimental results of refs .",
    "however , at difference with other simulation works@xcite , the quasi - logarithmic relaxation regime is only found in our simulations in the strong interaction regime , for short times , and within a narrow time window that depends on @xmath58 .",
    "this can be understood because of the short duration of the relaxations in other works compared to ours , which were extended up to 10000 mcs , thus confirming the limitation of the logarithmic approximation to narrow time windows .",
    "we will analyze the relaxation curves at different temperatures following the phenomenological @xmath4 scaling approach presented in previous works for non - interacting sytems @xcite and systems in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the method is based on the fact that the dynamics of a system of magnetic entities can be described in terms of thermal activation of the arrhenius type over effective local energy barriers .",
    "although one could think that this assumption is only valid in non - interacting particle systems , we would like to stress that the @xmath4 scaling approach was first successfully introduced in studies of spin - glasses , where short range frustrated interactions prevail . in systems with dipolar interactions , although the energy barrier landscape of the system change as the relaxation proceeds due to the long - range of the interaction , we will argue in the following sections that this fact does not preclude the applicability of scaling to low @xmath58 relaxations . in fact ,",
    "the accomplishment of the @xmath4 scaling in interacting systems and the effective energy barrier distributions deduced from the corresponding master curves provide information about the energy barriers that are effectively probed during the relaxation process , even if they keep on changing during the process .",

    "moreover , it seems that scaling is accomplished over a wider range of @xmath58 the stronger the interaction is , whereas in the weak interaction regime , scaling is fulfilled over a narrower range of times and @xmath58 .",
    "as we will explain latter , this fact is due to the different variation of the effective energy barriers contributing to the relaxation in the two regimes .    in order to see the influence of @xmath43 on the relaxation laws , we have plotted in fig .",

    "when plotted in a @xmath63 _ vs. _ @xmath0 scale they are linear ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ t7_masters_all_fig ] ) , indicating a power - law decay of the magnetization with time , since the energy scale can be converted to time through the @xmath4 variable .",
    "the curves can be fitted by @xmath64 , with a decay exponent that decreases with increasing @xmath43 , @xmath65 for @xmath66 respectively .",

    "it has also been observed experimentally in arrays of micromagnetic dots tracked by focused ion beam irradiation on a co layer with perpendicular anisotropy @xcite , and also in discontinuous multilayers @xcite .",
    "in order to gain some insight on what are the microscopic mechanisms that rule the different relaxation laws in the weak and strong interaction regimes , we will examine how the distribution of energy barriers and the distribution of dipolar fields change during the relaxation process . due to the distribution of anisotropy constants and easy - axes orientations and the non - uniformity of the @xmath45 equilibrated states , it is not easy to infer the microscopic origin of the initial distributions of energy barriers shown in fig .",
    "[ t7_eb_distrib_therma_fig]a .",
    "it turns out that histograms of the strengh of the dipolar fields across the system for different values of @xmath43 turn to be useful to stablish this connection as , at low @xmath58 , the direction and values of the local @xmath68 mainly determine the first stages of the relaxation process .",
    "let us also notice that the distribution of dipolar fields is only sensitive to the spin orientations and their positions in the lattice and does not depend on the anisotropy or easy - axis directions of the particles ,    the computed dipolar field distibutions @xmath69 obtained by a procedure similar to that used to compute the energy barrier distributions are displayed in fig .",
    "[ t7_eb_distrib_therma_fig]b , where the dipolar fields having a component in the negative @xmath70 direction have been given a negative sign . since most of the spins after the equilibration process are pointing along the minima closer to the positive @xmath70 axis , local @xmath68 pointing along the negative @xmath70 direction will give a higher probability for the spin to jump from a metastable state to the equilibrium state .",
    "for weak interaction ( @xmath51 ) , the initial @xmath69 is strongly peaked at a value which is very close to the dipolar field for a fm configuration @xmath71 .",
    "dipolar fields pointing in the negative direction are scarce , indicating that the equilibrated configuration is not far from the initial fm one . in this case",
    ", the spins remain close to the anisotropy axis since the energy minima and the energy barriers between them do not depart appreciably from the non - interacting case .",
    "this is also corroborated by the shape of @xmath50 which resembles that for @xmath72 .",
    "however , in the strong interaction regime , some of the local dipolar fields are strong enough to destroy the energy barriers of the particles with lower @xmath53 , and therefore the numerous negative dipolar fields are originated by particles that have rotated into the local field direction .",
    "there are still positive fields , but now the peak due to collinear spins blurs out with increasing @xmath43 ( it is visible at @xmath73 for @xmath74 respectively ) . at the same time , a second peak , centered at higher field values , starts to appear and finally swallows the first ( see the case @xmath57 ) .",
    "this last peak tends to a value equal to @xmath75 with increasing @xmath43 , which corresponds to fm alignment of the spins along the chain direction .",
    "all these features are also supported by the distributions of dipolar field angles ( see the inset in fig .",
    "[ t7_eb_distrib_therma_fig]b ) , which progressively peak around @xmath76 when increasing the interaction strength .",
    "this indicates the above mentioned tendency of spins to order along the chain direction when only one minimum is present .    in order to gain a deeper insight into the microscopic evolution of the system during the relaxation ,",
    "the histograms of energy barriers and dipolar fields at intermediate stages during the relaxation have been recorded after different mc steps .",
    "the results for the @xmath50 and @xmath77 evolution during a relaxation at an intermediate temperature @xmath78 are presented in fig.[t7_eb_distrib_finals_fig ] .",
    "the evolutions are markedly different in the two interaction regimes .    in the weak interaction regime ,",
    "the relaxation is dominated by anisotropy barriers , so that the distributions are similar to the non - interacting case . as time elapses , particles with the lowest energy barriers relax towards a state with higher energy barriers . however , although during the relaxation process the energy barriers change locally , this change is compensated by the average over the anisotropy distribution and random orientations of the easy - axes .",
    "thus , the global @xmath50 does not change significantly as the system relaxes , although at the final stages of the relaxation the system is in a much more disordered configuration than initially . in spite of this ,",
    "the distribution of dipolar fields , which is more sensitive to the local changes in spin configuration , presents evident changes with time as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ t7_hdip_distrib_finals_fig ] . as relaxation proceeds ,",
    "the high peak of positive @xmath79 progressively flattens , since it corresponds to particles whose magnetization is not pointing along the equilibrium direction .",
    "particles that have already relaxed , create dipolar fields in the negative direction which are reflected in a subdistribution of negative @xmath79 of increasing importance as time evolves . near the equilibrium state of quasi - zero magnetization ,",
    "the relative contribution of positive and negative fields tend to be equal , since , in average , there are equal number of `` up '' and `` down '' pointing spins .    in the strong interaction regime ( @xmath80 in figs .",
    "[ t7_eb_distrib_finals_fig ] and [ t7_hdip_distrib_finals_fig ] ) , dipolar fields are stronger than anisotropy fields ( @xmath81 ) for the majority of the particles , even at the earlier stages of the relaxation process . as time elapses , the number of small energy barriers , corresponding to the particles with smaller anisotropies , continuously diminishes as they are overcome by thermal activation .",
    "when relaxing to their equilibrium state , now closer to the dipolar field direction , the particles with initially small @xmath82 give rise to higher energy barriers and also higher dipolar fields on their neighbours .",
    "this is reflected in the increasingly higher peak in the @xmath50 that practically does not relax as time elapses , causing the final distribution to be completely different from the initial one .",
    "what is more , as more particles relax , more particles feel an @xmath83 and , therefore , a higher @xmath82 for reversal against the local field .",
    "this leads to faster changes in the dipolar field distribution and also is at the origin of the power - law character of the relaxations .",
    "equilibrium is reached when @xmath69 presents equal sharp peaked contributions from negative and positive fields , since in this case there is an equal number of particles with magnetizations with positive and negative components along the @xmath70 axis .",
    "our next goal is to extract the effective distributions of energy barriers from the master curves obtained from the @xmath4 scaling method and to understand what kind of microscopic information can be inferred from them in the case of interacting systems . in previous works @xcite , we have shown that in the range of validity of the @xmath4 scaling the effective distribution of energy barriers contributing to the long time relaxation process can be obtained from the master relaxation curve simply by performing its logarithmic time derivative @xmath84 .",

    "the effective distribution at high @xmath89 , which was there argued to be given by the intrinsic anisotropy barriers of the particles , appears shifted towards lower energy values with respect to the anisotropy distribution as derived from tem due to the demagnetizing dipolar fields generated by the almost aligned spin configuration induced by the @xmath89 . from magnetic noise measurements on self - assembled lattices of co particles , woods",

    "moreover , they found a finite residual magnetization at long times that is also observed in our relaxation curves ( see figs .",
    "[ t7_relax_log_fig ] and [ t7_relax_log_scaling_fig ] ) as a consequence of the competition between the randomness in anisotropy axis orientations and the frustration induced by the dipolar interactions .",
    "another simulation work have observed power - law decays of the magnetization in systems of ferromagnetic nanoparticles with dipolar interactions at high concentrations @xcite that approached a finite remanent magnetization .",
    "the authors explained these result by assuming that the relaxation rate followed a power - law decay with time . here , instead",
    ", we have been able to deduce directly the distribution of energy barriers responsible for this spin - glass like time dependence and to see that it coincides with the distribution deduced from the master relaxation curve .",
    "this energy barrier distribution is broadened and has an increasing contribution of small energy barriers as the dipolar interaction @xmath43 increases .",
    "these two features are in accordance with the experimentally observed broadening of the relaxation rates with respect to noninteracting particle systems found in relaxation experiments on nanosized maghemite particles @xcite and granular multilayers @xcite .",
    "although our results have been obtained for a one dimensional chain of magnetic entities , we believe that similar conclusions can be drawn for systems with higher effective dimensionality as long as their magnetic behaviour is dictated by long - range interactions .",
    "we have proved that , in the scope of our model , the @xmath4 scaling phenomenological model presented in previous works for non - interacting @xcite systems and for systems relaxing in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite is also valid for interacting systems within limits similar as those for non - interacting systems . from the master relaxation curves obtained by the application of this method , we have shown that effective energy barrier distributions can be obtained , giving valuable information about the microscopic energy barriers responsible for the relaxation . moreover , with this method , the variation of these energy barrier distributions can be monitored as a function of the dipolar interaction strength , an information that can not be directly measured .    for weak interactions ( diluted systems ) , the effective energy barrier distributions shift towards lower @xmath82 values with respect to the non - interacting case and become wider as the strength of the dipolar interaction @xmath43 increases , in qualitative agreement with experimental results . however , for strong interactions ( dense systems ) , the energy barrier distributions become a decreasing function of energy with an increasing contribution of quasi - zero barriers as @xmath43 increases .",
    "we believe that both behaviours can reconcile the contradictory explanations @xcite given to account for the variation of the blocking temperature @xmath1 with particle concentration in terms of energy barrier models . for weakly interacting systems ,",
    "the energy barriers relevant to the observation time window decrease with increasing interaction and consequently the same behaviour is expected for @xmath1 .",
    "this is corresponds to the observations by mrup and collegues @xcite in mssbauer experiments on maghemite nanoparticles .",
    "however , when interparticle interactions are strong enough to dominate over the disorder induced by the distribution of anisotropy axes , we have shown that the dynamic effects are ruled out by an effective energy distribution that broadens towards higher energies as @xmath43 increases .",
    "consequently , an increase in the blocking temperature is expected as observed in the ac susceptibility measurements on co clusters by luis et al ."
