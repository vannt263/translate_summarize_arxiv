    "the non - perturbative renormalisation ( npr ) of lattice qcd matrix elements is an important topic for the phenomenological relevance of the field .",
    "this paper addresses two key limitations of the popular rome - southampton ri / mom method@xcite : firstly the entangled discretisation and perturbative truncation errors and secondly the rather low scale at which continuum perturbation theory is applied .",
    "phenomenology requires that scheme dependent qcd observables calculated within lattice qcd are converted to a perturbatively amenable scheme such as @xmath4 .",
    "this is often done using an intermediate , regularisation invariant momentum scheme ( known as ri / mom ) .",
    "the conversion of lattice results to the ri / mom scheme is non - perturbative and the scale is defined by the momenta used .",
    "obtaining precision in the lattice calculation requires that the momentum scale used is well below the lattice cut - off , giving the high end of the rome - southampton momentum `` window '' condition : @xmath5 the perturbative conversion between ri / mom ( or ri / smom in the case of non - exceptional kinematics ) and @xmath4 is known for many operators to as many as three loops .",
    "perturbative accuracy is dependent on satisfying the lower inequality in eq . .",
    "the error associated with the low end of the window depends on logarithms the physical momentum scale , while the high end converges more benignly as a power of the dimensionless momentum scale ( @xmath6 in the case of domain wall fermions ) .",
    "the continuum extrapolation enabled by this work affords some tolerance to operating near the margins at high momentum by extrapolating away discretisation errors .",
    "the step scaling proposed in this work is intended to raise the momentum scale into a more convergent perturbative regime .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : background ]",
    "we summarise the method of off - shell non - perturbative renormalisation . in section  [ sec : formulation ] we introduce twisted boundary conditions for off - shell renormalisation .",
    "this is motivated in section  [ sec : fourierbad ] where we explain how this solves a serious theoretical problem with defining the continuum limit of operators renormalised using ri / mom .",
    "the implementation of twisted boundary conditions in the valence sector for fermion vertex functions is discussed in section  [ sec : twistednpr ] , and we define lattice kinematics ( [ sec : kinematics ] ) with which we intend to take the continuum limit ( [ sec : context ] ) for both exceptional and non - exceptional momenta .",
    "our proposed step scaling scheme , based on these techniques , is discussed in section  [ sec : stepscaling ] .",
    "we present data for the amputated vertex functions at a single lattice spacing in section  [ sec : data ] . in section  [ sec : stepdata ]",
    "we demonstrate practicality using existing configurations to take the continuum limit for the first step in the step scaling programme .",
    "the rome - southampton ri / mom approach @xcite involves a simple physically defined momentum scheme , albeit with particularly unphysical renormalisation conditions . for any given operator , @xmath7 , a momentum configuration for the vertex function of that operator is chosen with momenta @xmath8 selected from the fourier modes for the simulated lattice size @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is an integer : @xmath11 , with @xmath12 .",
    "the renormalisation condition for any regularization scheme @xmath13 chooses counter terms such that renormalised amputated vertex function , in landau gauge and for a chosen set of external momenta , is equal to the tree level operator .",
    "for example , for bilinears this is @xmath14 where @xmath15 represents an amputated vertex function .",
    "the original paper used the amplitude with @xmath16 the approach facilitates the conversion between different schemes because all that is required in any given scheme @xmath13 is a self - consistent calculation of the relevant scattering amplitude to some order . by virtue of the physical definition , one scheme can be a fully non - perturbative lattice calculation with some lattice action at non - zero lattice spacing .",
    "thus , within the scaling window , eq  ( [ eq : window ] ) , a lattice simulation can be matched directly to continuum perturbation theory without use of ill - convergent lattice perturbation theory .",
    "this momentum window argument motivates the neglect of discretisation errors in a certain limit .",
    "we shall see in section  [ sec : formulation ] that a rigorous continuum extrapolation using the original method is made impossible due to the use of fourier modes .",
    "this is because keeping both the direction and magnitude of the physical momenta fixed while changing the lattice spacing is incompatible with the discrete momentum spectrum .      in the original ri / mom kinematic choice",
    "a single gluon can carry all the hard momentum through the vertex leading to infra - red effects which fall only as @xmath17 . depending on the operator",
    "these effects have a non - trivial dependence on the valence quark mass that can complicate mass extrapolations , and in some cases require pion pole subtraction @xcite .",
    "rbc and ukqcd have developed the non - exceptional momentum , smom , kinematic point as a preferred matching condition @xcite .",
    "a significant gain comes from the extra suppression of non - perturbative effects .",
    "the perturbative expansion must be calculated for non - exceptional momenta ; this has been performed to one loop for bilinear operators @xcite and for @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "two recent publications have extended this to two loops for two different schemes for the quark mass @xcite .",
    "the non - exceptional kinematic point for bilinears has @xmath19    rbc and ukqcd have found @xcite that both momentum and mass dependence are simplified with non - exceptional kinematics . with this momentum flow ,",
    "multiple hard gluons are required to create a soft sub - graph and non - perturbative infra - red effects , such as spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , fall as a higher power of the external momentum , @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "as our aim is to carefully study vertex functions while reducing the volume , we require a momentum scheme that is not sensitive to condensate physics .      the original method used a single point source to calculate momentum space green s functions .",
    "the volume source technique was developed by qcdsf @xcite .",
    "the attraction here is to evaluate the amputated vertex function with the operator insertion averaged over all @xmath21 lattice sites .",
    "we shall see it is easily possible to obtain 0.1% statistical errors with volume source techniques , and even smaller if hundreds of configurations or larger volumes were used . with this statistical precision systematic effects like @xmath22",
    "breaking lattice artefacts are visible and are in fact the dominant systematic error .",
    "these must either be included in the error analysis or better yet addressed using the techniques of this paper to escape the fourier constraints .",
    "we use @xmath23 , @xmath24 to represent colour indices , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 to represent spin indices .",
    "we define the four momentum source , used on a landau gauge fixed configuration , as    @xmath27    where the ( dimensionless ) momenta are @xmath28 . on a given gauge field @xmath29 we solve @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the domain wall fermion matrix @xcite .",
    "one propagator inversion for each leg momentum is necessary , but this cost is more than offset by the gain in statistical accuracy from the volume average .    to compute the external legs required for amputating the vertex functions we require the momentum space propagator @xmath32",
    "we form phased propagators for each momentum : @xmath33 we select two independent momenta @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , and form unamputated bilinear vertex functions @xmath36 for dirac structure @xmath37 : @xmath38_{ij,\\alpha\\beta } , \\ ] ] and also for four quark operators : @xmath39 here , external colour and spin indices are left free for off line amputation and projection .",
    "this allows us to define the amputated green s function as , for example , @xmath40^\\dagger \\gamma_5 \\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath41 , and we take @xmath42 .",
    "the bare vertex amplitudes are then obtained by projecting the amputated green s functions onto their tree level values , for example @xmath43",
    "we will motivate and introduce the use of twisted boundary conditions in the context of off - shell renormalisation .",
    "this will enable us to develop a framework for better controlled continuum extrapolation than is possible using fourier modes .      in continuum euclidean space simultaneously rotating all momenta in a scattering amplitude by any @xmath0 matrix must give equivalent results .",
    "however , in our discrete system there is only @xmath44 symmetry and , even in the infinite volume , only momenta related by @xmath45 rotations and reflections are equivalent .",
    "vertex functions will receive _ different _ @xmath46 errors depending on the direction of the momentum relative to the lattice axes .",
    "the original studies did not resolve @xmath47 breaking lattice artefacts due to statistical imprecision .",
    "different @xmath47 equivalent but @xmath48 distinct momentum configurations , given by different fourier modes , were treated interchangeably and simply averaged together .",
    "this is backed to some extent by the rome - southampton window argument for a region of safe operation with respect to lattice artefacts .    when the method outlined above is combined with a continuum extrapolation ,",
    "the naive use of @xmath48 inequivalent momenta as interchangeable is theoretically unsound because @xmath0 breaking is a component of the lattice artefacts that should be removed by the extrapolation .",
    "if the orientation of momenta relative to lattice axes does not remain fixed as @xmath1 is changed , an extrapolation in @xmath1 is _ not _ formally valid as one uses a _ different _ observable for each lattice spacing ( differing due to @xmath48 inequivalent momentum choices ) .",
    "the fourier constraints make it difficult to select the same physical momentum simultaneously on more than one lattice spacing , and these differing @xmath0 breaking lattice artefacts necessarily enter each data point in a continuum extrapolation of data renormalised using the rome - southampton method .",
    "this introduces an intrinsic systematic uncertainty at a level set by the size of @xmath0 breaking artefacts .",
    "@xmath0 breaking effects were argued to be ignorable as they were not statistically resolved .",
    "this justifies smooth interpolation in @xmath3 to obtain matched physical momenta .",
    "it also somewhat justifies an ( otherwise dubious ) continuum extrapolation .",
    "we measure the vertex function observable on different lattice spacings at the same physical momentum magnitude , but must pick @xmath48 inequivalent momenta to satisfy fourier constraints .",
    "this results in incorrectly parametrised lattice artefacts , however @xmath47 breaking effects can be safely ignored when they are substantially smaller than statistical errors .    with the volume source technique ,",
    "however , @xmath0 breaking effects are well resolved and are a dominant systematic error .",
    "this compromises our ability to perform a continuum extrapolation , and these considerations represent a serious problem that we address in this paper with the use of twisted boundary conditions .      from the discussion of the previous subsection  [ sec : fourierbad ]",
    "we see that it would be rather better to crisply remove lattice artefacts by continuum extrapolation , and only apply perturbative matching in the continuum limit .",
    "this is difficult when constrained to use fourier modes .",
    "applying twisted boundary conditions to propagator inversions enables arbitrary momenta to be used .",
    "the twisted boundary approach differs by only finite volume effects from a simulation on a much larger lattice with an exact fourier mode of the same momentum .    in order to simultaneously satisfy the constraint and only use one momentum direction we propose choosing one kinematic satisfying and use twisted boundary conditions @xcite , to vary the magnitude of the momentum .",
    "the twisting technique has been used to insert arbitrary three - momenta in form factor calculations with the success demonstrated , for example , by the direct comparison of refs @xcite to refs @xcite . which make use of the same configurations and action .    in this paper",
    "the technique is used to allow arbitrary four - momenta to be used @xcite , and hence allow to rigorously disentangle discretisation and perturbative truncation effects for the first time .",
    "of course , the lattice artefacts are still present at finite lattice spacing but , up to finite volume effects , these become the _ same _ lattice artefact at each lattice spacing .",
    "this is not the case if different fourier modes are used .",
    "the goal is to enable us to determine the non - perturbative anomalous running in the ri scheme in the continuum limit prior to the use of continuum perturbation theory .",
    "we now formulate the momentum space propagator calculation with twisted boundary conditions for use in off - shell renormalisation .",
    "let the quark fields satisfy twisted boundary conditions @xmath49 and define @xcite @xmath50 with @xmath51 so that @xmath52 satisfies periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this transformation changes the continuum dirac operator : @xmath53 @xmath54 has inverse @xmath55 and @xmath56 has inverse @xmath57 ; they are related by @xmath58 using translational invariance which we should recover after gauge averaging .",
    "let @xmath59 then @xmath60 so inverting the twisted dirac operator with a momentum source gives @xmath61 .",
    "note that @xmath62 satisfies periodic boundary conditions so that in the source term , @xmath63 , @xmath64 is a fourier mode .",
    "@xmath61 is related to @xmath65 via , @xmath66 the propagator can be obtained from , @xmath67 thus the net effect of twisted boundary conditions is to shift the momentum @xmath2 to @xmath68 where b is arbitrary . in order to compute the non - exceptional green s functions",
    "observe , @xmath69 using the inverse of @xmath70 the vertex function is seen to be , @xmath71    we consider the values for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 in the following subsection .      , @xmath35 and @xmath74 must be equal in magnitude and are represented as an equilateral triangle with vertices touching the @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 axes . with twisted boundary conditions",
    "the sides of this triangle can be continuously scaled allowing both smooth interpolation of momentum dependence and controlled continuum extrapolation .",
    "this is very much in contrast to the situation that arises when using only fourier modes .",
    "[ fig : mom ] , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we select euclidean momenta in the direction of @xmath78 and @xmath79 up to @xmath44 symmetry operations . this choice minimises @xmath80 which we take as measure of discretization errors , subject to the constraint that @xmath34/@xmath35/@xmath74 be @xmath44 equivalent momenta .",
    "it is certainly possible to rotate some combination of @xmath81 into the temporal direction breaking this @xmath44 equivalence , and this would form an interesting possibility to demonstrate universality of the continuum limit in a later work .",
    "the non - exceptional @xmath34/@xmath35/@xmath74 kinematics can be represented by an equilateral triangle in momentum space with vertices lying on the @xmath81 coordinate axes ( figure  [ fig : mom ] ) .",
    "continuous dilation of this triangle can be performed by using twisted boundary conditions with a fixed orientation of the @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath82 triangle .",
    "this continuity allows one to pick a fixed mom observable as the lattice spacing is varied .",
    "in particular , we choose parallel twisting vectors in the directions @xmath83 corresponding to @xmath34 and @xmath84 corresponding to @xmath35 .",
    "we continuously vary @xmath85 to move the vertices of the triangle along the axes .",
    "the non - exceptional momenta are chosen to have small discretisation errors by spreading the power across multiple coordinate axes .",
    "in general for any non - exceptional configuration there will be @xmath46 errors .",
    "for exceptional momentum amplitudes we take vertex functions with @xmath34 on both legs . as the direction",
    "is kept fixed the vertex function is a smooth function of @xmath86 and interpolation in momentum is possible .",
    "extrapolation to the continuum limit at fixed physical momentum is now theoretically justified .      between different lattice spacings",
    "we compare only renormalised quantities and their ratios .",
    "this is quite natural as we desire to take the continuum limit of the product of a bare operator matrix element and its ri scheme renormalisation constant at some accessible scale @xmath2 .",
    "the scaling factors for each operator to match between different @xmath26 s introduced in @xcite are then not required .",
    "the aim of the latter part of this paper will be to raise , in the continuum limit , this scale @xmath2 to one ( @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a scale factor ) where there is better perturbative convergence .",
    "we eliminate @xmath89 via the vertex function of the ( conserved ) vector or axial currents : @xmath90 and this ratio will be extrapolated to the chiral limit to produce a renormalization constant @xmath91 where , for convenience , we use the vertex function of the local rather than conserved axial current and eliminate this with a previously computed @xmath92 .",
    "we then continuum extrapolate the product of @xmath93 with @xmath94 : @xmath95 this gives @xmath96 in the ri / mom scheme at a scale determined by the physical momentum chosen which must be the same scale on all the lattices used to take the continuum limit .",
    "we also consider the factor required to convert @xmath94 at scale @xmath2 to scale @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a scale factor .",
    "this is @xmath99 and its continuum limit is @xmath100 @xmath101 encodes the scale dependence of the ri scheme in the continuum limit expanded around the scale @xmath2 .",
    "we can then assess the degree to which the running around our match scale is perturbative without risk of confusion by possible lattice artefacts . by picking a well defined momentum orientation for the amplitude as a function of @xmath1 , we remove the ambiguity in taking the continuum limit that arises when selecting different fourier modes for each value of @xmath26 .",
    "we have demonstrated how to obtain a controlled expansion in powers of the lattice spacing for amputated vertex functions and gain better control of lattice artefacts via continuum extrapolation .",
    "qcd perturbation theory at lattice scales is not rapidly convergent , and a means to increase this scale without applying brute force to raise the lattice cut - off is required .",
    "step - scaling @xcite is the natural approach to do this where , in a series of simulations , the physical volume is reduced as the lattice spacing is reduced to enable the renormalisation scale to be raised without the cost associated with simulating all scales on a single lattice .",
    "step scaling has been well developed in the schrdinger functional approach @xcite .",
    "a finite volume scheme based on creutz ratios has also been recently developed @xcite . in this paper",
    "we seek to develop a related approach based on the landau gauge fixed ri / mom method .",
    "our approach does not tie the renormalisation scale to the volume , and therefore also avoids the need to fine tune bare couplings to precisely match a volume sensitive renormalised coupling between simulations .    after reviewing existing step scaling methods we will attempt to address perturbative errors associated with the low - end of the rome - southampton scaling window by raising the scale at which we match to perturbation theory by introducing a new step scaling scheme . in order to use the same notational conventions as the literature on step scaling in the schrdinger functional scheme , for the rest of this section let @xmath102 represent the length of the lattice in physical units rather than units of lattice spacing .",
    "this departs from our convention elsewhere in the paper , which takes @xmath102 as an integer lattice size and is consistent with notation typically used for ri / mom renormalization .      in step",
    "scaling there is typically a renormalisation condition imposed that is physically defined in a fictional finite volume universe . in the case of the schrdinger functional",
    "this is the coupling @xmath103 at a scale @xmath104 defined by the volume . a second simulation , at the same bare coupling and with larger volume @xmath105 , then gives the coupling at a scale @xmath106 @xmath107 here @xmath98 is a scale factor , and is typically @xmath108 .",
    "the continuum limit @xmath109 is taken _ while holding the measured coupling @xmath110 fixed_. hence @xmath110 has no @xmath1 dependence and the trajectory to the continuum limit leaves the renormalised coupling @xmath110 lattice artefact free at ( and only at ) the scale @xmath104 .",
    "however , @xmath111 is lattice spacing dependent , with discretisation errors that are removed by taking this continuum limit .",
    "thus @xmath110 is the observable quantity used to define the lattice spacing and hence physical volume .",
    "the schdinger functional is particularly economical since this is in fact the most infra - red scale accessible within the simulated volume .",
    "when two consecutive scale evolution steps are considered , two sequences of simulations must be performed to determine the evolution of the coupling from scale @xmath112 , and from @xmath113 in such a way that @xmath114 . since",
    "_ different quantities _ @xmath115 and @xmath116 are held fixed for the two sequences of simulations ( and effectively determine the lattice spacings ) , satisfaction of the constraint @xmath114 in the continuum limit is ensured by defining the scaling trajectory for the second sequence such that @xmath117 .    since each simulation must correctly describe the length scales associated with the quantity used to determine trajectory to the continuum limit , carefully changing this between steps was a key component allowing the volume to be reduced .",
    "this is a feature we intend to reproduce in our method .    in the schrdinger functional @xmath118 defines the scaling trajectory and is _ directly _ coupled to the volume . taking the continuum limit holding @xmath118 fixed then requires fine tuning of @xmath26 to _ exactly _ match the desired non - perturbative coupling  and hence to match physical volumes defined by using @xmath118 to set the scale .",
    "this is a fine tuning step that our proposal below avoids .",
    "the possibility of step scaling with ri / mom has been previously studied @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this work used a series of quenched configurations where the ratio of lattice spacings had been tuned to be precisely a factor of two to obtain aligned fourier modes .",
    "this fine tuning is expensive in a dynamical simulation .",
    "use of power counting and the rome - southampton scaling window was made , rather than the controlled continuum extrapolation at fixed physical momentum introduced in this paper .",
    "free parameters for each operator were introduced to match the renormalisation constants for different @xmath26 s corresponding to the ( possibly non - perturbative ) anomalous scaling of the operator with the lattice cut - off .",
    "this excellent start was not easily developed into a practical technique .      in order to develop a practical step scaling scheme we require several pieces .",
    "firstly , we have defined continuum limit non - perturbative evolution ratios that can be used to access higher momentum scales .",
    "step scaling will combine a sequence of these objects , each determined inexpensively compared with a brute force method .",
    "we believe that three technical advantages we have over the earlier attempt at ri / mom step scaling make the task more tractable .",
    "the first , volume sources , reduces statistical errors greatly giving precision to the approach .",
    "the second , non - exceptional momenta , renders mass dependence and infra - red behaviour in @xmath3 benign ; this greatly assists with both chiral extrapolation and matching between ensembles , in addition to finite volume sensitivity .",
    "these were described above .    in this paper",
    "we have introduced a third advantage : using twisted boundary conditions to select arbitrary four momenta .",
    "the direction of the scattering momenta can be kept fixed relative to lattice axes and arbitrary values of @xmath3 can be chosen .",
    "this is a good thing because it allows the same physical momenta according to the lattice symmetries @xmath44 to be chosen on each ensemble .",
    "the vertex function observable will _ only then _ have a valid expansion in powers of the lattice spacing @xmath1 .",
    "this approach enables precise matching of momenta between ensembles , and precise continuum extrapolation .",
    "we will keep the off - shell momentum scales hard enough that the physical volume should not be resolved . in this way",
    "the the calculation will be finite volume effect safe , and the perturbative matching will use the standard infinite volume perturbation theory already available to high order for off - shell renormalisation .",
    "these are significant advantages over the schrdinger functional .",
    "for the scheme to be affordable it is therefore necessary that it be able to operate in a small physical volume . for offshell amplitudes",
    "this is the case whenever the virtuality is too hard to resolve the finite volume @xmath119 thus , for the purposes of step scaling , the window condition eq  ( [ eq : window ] ) becomes @xmath120 this latter condition is likely possible to meet using modest lattice volumes @xmath121 at all stages of the calculation .",
    "we will compute vertex functions on lattices at different values of @xmath26 with overlapping scaling windows .",
    "this will then enable the determination of a continuum step scaling function for some operator @xmath122 at a physical scale @xmath3 chosen in the window eq  ( [ eq : sswindow ] ) to that at a scale larger by a scale factor @xmath88 .",
    "this is precisely @xmath123 from the previous section .",
    "these can be combined in a series of non - perturbative steps to a high scale , with perturbative conversion to @xmath4 is then applied only where it is well convergent .",
    "for example , @xmath124 .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] it appears clear that eq  ( [ eq : sswindow ] ) can be satisfied at reasonable expense . for example @xmath125 domain wall fermion simulations will be inexpensive with the next generation of supercomputers ; multiple such ensembles dedicated solely to the renormalisation of lattice operators are quite affordable .",
    "this is particularly helped by the relatively benign mass dependence of non - exceptional momentum vertex functions .",
    "it is also clear that on these proposed small ensembles all hadronic quantities must be avoided to ensure finite volume safety of the analysis . for the determination of @xmath126 ,",
    "the pcac is an operator relation and so it is immaterial whether a finite volume or a physical pionic state is used to determine the ratio .",
    "determining the lattice spacing ( or more specifically the ratio of the lattice spacing to that of an earlier larger volume simulation ) in a finite volume safe manner is discussed below .",
    "we now define how the continuum limit of @xmath127 should be taken to obtain @xmath128 . in order to avoid the fine tuning problem",
    "we seek a quantity @xmath129 associated with a continuously variable length scale @xmath130 significantly shorter than the lattice extent @xmath102 to determine the trajectory to the continuum limit .",
    "we plan to reduce the volume successively with each step , and a different definition of the lattice spacing ( e.g. a different @xmath130 ) must be used for each step .    in the schrdinger functional method",
    "this is done by fine tuning ( i.e. constraining ) @xmath131 for each non - zero lattice spacing entering the continuum extrapolation of @xmath132 to match the continuum limit of the high scale coupling obtained from the previous step , @xmath133 .",
    "we seek a the family of scale determining quantities @xmath134 that each be used to determine the lattice spacing in the corresponding @xmath135-th step of the step scaling scheme .",
    "these will play part of the role that @xmath136 plays for the schrdinger functional .",
    "the continuum limit of successive quantities @xmath137 in the sequence will be determined non - perturbatively as we proceed .",
    "previously determined values will be used to define the trajectory to the continuum limit for successive steps . as a concrete example our initial results we will take @xmath137 to be the static inter - quark force and so the determination of the lattice spacings corresponds to a family of sommer scales based on the static potential . in the schrdinger",
    "functional the quantity @xmath137 corresponds to the coupling @xmath138 .    at step @xmath135",
    "we will determine the continuum limit of @xmath139 while determining the lattice spacing @xmath140 from @xmath141 , and thus must maintain the constraint @xmath142 while taking the continuum limit : @xmath143 so that , for example , we determine the continuum limit of the inter - quark force at a reduced length scale in one step , and then reuse this to constrain the trajectory to the continuum limit in the next step . using this trajectory",
    "we define the scale evolution functions @xmath144 , @xmath145 where @xmath146 is determined by the previous step .",
    "when @xmath129 is a function of a continuous scale @xmath147 , this distance can be varied post simulation and without finite volume effects , and this allows us to avoid fine tuning @xmath26 .",
    "ultimately this process will become difficult as all dependence on lattice spacing becomes logarithmic and precision quantities are required ; however , there may also be less appropriate but expedient choices that enable immediate progress for a few steps away from our relatively coarse simulations .",
    "we consider two possibilities .",
    "we note the static potential has been measured successfully over a large range of length scales in the quenched approximation with the wilson gauge action @xcite .",
    "this involved the use of a shorter length scale @xmath148 than the more common @xmath149 @xcite .",
    "this calculation is also interesting because it successfully fits @xmath150 as a polynomial in @xmath26 .",
    "such an approach may ultimately assist continuing lattice spacing determinations to increasingly fine and small volume simulations .",
    "we consider a sequence of scales , of the same class as the sommer scale @xmath151 the sommer scale @xmath152 takes @xmath153    thus a step scaling scheme with scale factor @xmath88 can then be defined choosing @xmath154 and @xmath155 as follows :    * determine @xmath156 in continuum limit holding @xmath157 fixed such that @xmath158 * determine @xmath159 in continuum limit holding @xmath152 fixed * decrease @xmath102 by @xmath160 without fine tuning * determine @xmath161 in continuum limit holding @xmath162 fixed such that @xmath163 * determine @xmath164 in continuum limit holding @xmath165 fixed * decrease @xmath102 by @xmath160 without fine tuning + etc ...    following a rule of thumb that @xmath166 for the static potential should ensure finite volume safety and enable simulation down to @xmath167 when using scales similar to @xmath168 to set the scale . eventually this will become imprecise when entering a region where the potential runs logarithmically .",
    "however we believe a substantial benefit is already achievable prior to addressing this issue .      in principle",
    ", we can use the momentum dependence of the off - shell vertex functions themselves to match the lattic scales between different ensembles .",
    "this may assisted by the improved techniques of this paper , particularly the tunable momentum scale which allows us to select the length scale that sets lattice spacing",
    ". this will be the subject of further study .",
    "if we accept fine tuning , it is also possible to combine step scaling of off - shell vertex functions with existing finite volume schemes such as the schrdinger functional or the wilson loop scheme used to match lattice spacings .",
    "we use the domain wall fermion action @xcite , and @xmath169 ensembles with @xmath170 and with the iwasaki gauge action @xcite .",

    "the @xmath173 ensembles were studied extensively in ref .",
    "the three @xmath173 @xmath125 ensembles used in this section have strange quark mass @xmath174 and degenerate light quark masses @xmath175 .",
    "the second ensemble set with @xmath176 is not previously published and was used as part of a parameter search , made in the style of @xcite , prior to our @xmath177 simulations @xcite which lie nearby in parameter space .",
    "there are two ensembles with @xmath174 and @xmath178 .",
    "there are around 2000 trajectories in these ensembles .",
    "for @xmath173 the extrapolations to @xmath179 were made with @xmath180 , @xmath181 , and the lattice spacing was taken as @xmath182 gev @xcite .",
    "we find in this paper that @xmath176 corresponds to an inverse lattice spacing of around @xmath183gev , we estimate @xmath184 and @xmath185 by interpolating between nearby values for @xmath26 .",
    "this is not ideal , but adequate for the purposes of this demonstration .",
    "all of the vertex function data was computed using the volume source method with twisted boundary conditions as described in section [ sec : twistednpr ] using 20 gauge configurations for each mass , see tables [ tab : gauge2.13 ] and [ tab : gauge2.23 ] with momenta in table [ tab : momenta ] .",

    "because so few configurations are needed with the volume averaging a large @xmath186 was chosen to minimise auto - correlation effects . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     by demanding @xmath187 we solve for @xmath188 using table [ tab : vglue ] .",
    "this approach leads to much reduced lattice @xmath46 errors @xcite @xcite .",
    "further , using the force instead of the potential removes the self energy part and reduces the linear term , @xmath189 , to a constant . fitting the cornell potential to find",
    "@xmath190 requires @xmath191 .",
    "however , @xmath191 is dependant on the long distance behaviour of @xmath192 , and to constrain it one has to sample large @xmath193 .",
    "when fitting to the force , @xmath190 can be obtained without including large distance data in the procedure , and @xmath190 computed this way is a finite volume safe observable with which to determine the lattice spacing .    in order to extract @xmath192 from the average wilson loops @xmath194 we first plot the effective potential @xmath195 as a function of @xmath196 .",
    "the largest value of @xmath193 used in this analysis is @xmath197 .",
    "excited state contamination and statistical noise are problematic , and we use the black box method @xcite to define an improved effective mass that takes account of the first excited state .",
    "this allows us to extend @xmath198 to @xmath199 which gives a significant error reduction compared to the usual effective mass . on the @xmath171 lattice we use @xmath200 configurations for each mass ,",
    "each configuration rotated to use 4 different time directions .",
    "for @xmath172 we use @xmath201 configurations per mass and again rotate the time direction .",
    "the equation @xmath202 has solutions in the range of our data for @xmath203 .",
    "lower values give more accurate @xmath190 but these are likely to have large discretisation errors . for any @xmath204",
    "however @xmath205 should be constant , we plot this ratio as a function of @xmath204 in figure [ fig : constbb ] and determine @xmath206 is appropriate and gives the value for the ratio of lattice scales , @xmath207 this implies a lattice spacing of @xmath208 gev for the @xmath176 ensembles .",

    "the static potential displays percent scale errors even with many configurations and finding a more precise alternative would certainly be good in any case .",
    "following equation [ eq : sig ] we can compute @xmath213 using two lattice spacings .",
    "we consider the evolution of renormalisation constants @xmath89 , @xmath214 , @xmath215 , and @xmath216 in both the exceptional and the non - exceptional kinematic schemes . we choose @xmath217 and compute @xmath213 as a function of s.     +   +     +   +     +   +    because of the very smooth @xmath3 dependence of the vertex functions computed with twisted boundary conditions we can perform a simple interpolation to match values of @xmath3 on each lattice",
    "one could in principle simulate at the same physical momentum on each lattice by choosing the twisting angles appropriately , however since the interpolation introduced only a very small uncertainty this was not necessary .    for each operator we can now evaluate @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "linear extrapolation in @xmath220 with only two datapoints is not as robust as one might like , but certainly suffices to demonstrate the method . using this",
    ", we can obtain the continuum limit step scaling function @xmath221 for the quark field ( figure  [ fig : zqrun ] ) , mass ( figure  [ fig : zmrun ] ) , tensor current ( figure  [ fig : ztrun ] ) , and the four quark operator @xmath222 ( figure  [ fig : zbkrun ] ) . with an appropriate third and smaller lattice spacing using a correspondingly smaller volume we could similarly determine the next step , evolving from 3 gev to 4.5 gev and so on .",
    "figure [ fig : zqrun ] is especially important , because @xmath89 suffers from the greatest lattice artefacts for domain wall fermions , and is carefully eliminated in the npr analysis of other operators .    in the @xmath223 scheme , with both exceptional and non - exceptional momenta , the finite lattice spacing running of @xmath89 is in the _ opposite _ direction to the perturbative prediction , however the running behaviour recovered in the continuum limit is close to perturbative .",
    "the determination of @xmath89 with domain wall fermions displays the momentum dependence of the exponent , @xmath224 , of localisation in the fifth dimension @xcite . as shown here , in a number of schemes , as long as an unambiguous continuum limit can be defined , the domain - wall action will then produce the continuum scaling behaviour of @xmath89 and the other renormalization constants .",
    "we have introduced the use of twisted boundary conditions in off - shell renormalisation .",
    "this enables controlled continuum extrapolation of the relevant amplitudes and rigorous disentangling of lattice artefacts from perturbative truncation errors in the method .",
    "we outlined a step scaling approach based on the scheme that will allow us to raise the scales at which perturbation theory is applied .",
    "the method has been demonstrated by taking the continuum limit of the first step scaling function in the process .",
    "we can certainly raise this scale from around 2 gev to at least around 5 gev , and perhaps higher .",
    "the 5gev upper scale is limited only by the range over which our current matching based on the static potential is likely to be precise .",
    "this is , in any case , the scale above which one should consider charm and bottom quark effects . were an appropriately precise method for matching lattice scales ( or renormalised couplings ) available , the method could then be applied to evolve the three flavour theory to very high momentum scales , of order @xmath225 .",
    "the lattice spacing matching strategy will be the subject of further study , however , raising the scale at which , typically two or three loop , perturbation theory is applied for rome - southampton renormalisation for much important lattice phenomenology is already a significant step . for example , a naive estimate of an @xmath226 truncation error with o(1 ) coefficient is reduced from 3% to under 1% by raising this scale to 5 gev .",
    "we plan to produce continuum limit scale evolution functions spanning the complete range of lattice operators covering the region 2 - 5 gev .",
    "this includes all lattice bilinear and four quark operators , bilinear operators with covariant derivatives for structure functions and distribution amplitudes , and three quark operators relevant for proton decay matrix elements .    obtaining the scaling functions in the continuum limit",
    "will enable calculations with any lattice action to raise the reference scale at which operators are quoted in @xmath4 from 2 gev to 5 gev with substantial reduction in systematic errors .",
