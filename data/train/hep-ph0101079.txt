    "the present and next generation of colliders will help elucidate the nature of the electroweak symmetry breaking and to determine if the symmetry breaking is due to the presence of a higgs boson .",
    "precision fits of the standard model seem to indirectly point at the existence of a light higgs boson ( @xmath4 gev)@xcite , while the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) requires the existence of a scalar higgs lighter than about 130 gev .",
    "thus , a higgs discovery by the tevatron or the lhc in the mass range around @xmath5 gev seems a likely possibility .",
    "the role of the next generation of @xmath1 colliders will therefore not be to make a higgs discovery , but rather to obtain precision measurements of the higgs properties and to use them to understand the underlying mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the production of a higgs boson in association with a pair of @xmath0 quarks is of particular interest for two reasons .",
    "first , the @xmath6 production mode can be an important discovery mode for a higgs boson around @xmath5 gev at the lhc@xcite or the tevatron@xcite .",
    "second , this channel offers a direct handle on the yukawa coupling of the top quark to the higgs boson .",
    "= 2.2 in = 2.2 in",
    "the process @xmath7 has been studied extensively and has been calculated both in the sm and in the mssm at @xmath8@xcite . for a sm higgs , the factor @xmath9 at @xmath10 gev",
    "is in the range @xmath11 , depending on @xmath12 .",
    "however the cross section is drastically suppressed by phase space and for @xmath13 gev is of the order of @xmath14 . on the other hand ,",
    "at @xmath15 tev the cross section for @xmath16 gev is about @xmath17 and is only slightly reduced by qcd corrections ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the energy dependence of the rate is shown in fig .",
    "1 and it is clear that the optimal energy is somewhere around @xmath19 .",
    "although the cross section is small , the signature for @xmath20 production is spectacular .",
    "the possibility of fully reconstructing the two top quarks in the final state allows efficient discrimination of the signal over the background , and together with a good b - tagging efficiency is crucial for increasing the precision with which the top yukawa coupling can be measured .",
    "a detailed simulation@xcite of @xmath21 for a @xmath22 higgs , at @xmath23 gev , found that the top yukawa coupling could potentially be measured with a precision of 5.5% when optimal b - tagging efficiency is assumed . at lower energies , and for heavier higgs masses",
    ", the precision deteriorates rapidly.@xcite",
    "associated production of a higgs boson and a @xmath24 pair in the mssm can be very different from the standard model since the @xmath25 coupling can be significantly suppressed for small @xmath26 , ( where @xmath27 is now the lightest neutral higgs boson of the mssm ) .",
    "in addition , the presence of additional higgs bosons leads to the possibility of new processes and of resonance effects .",
    "an example is @xmath28 , which is illustrated in the right hand plot of fig . 1 .",
    "( @xmath29 is the heavier of the neutral higgs bosons of the mssm ) .",
    "the resonance at @xmath30 is apparent .",
    "the main channels in the mssm are the scalar ones , i.e. @xmath31 and @xmath32 , since the pseudoscalar mode @xmath33 is very suppressed over most of the mssm parameter space . over most of the @xmath34 plane , it is possible to observe either @xmath31 or @xmath32 with a rate greater than @xmath35 at @xmath36.@xcite",
    "scenarios such as that proposed by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos , and dvali,@xcite ( add ) in which gravity propagates in @xmath37 dimensions can have a dramatic effect on higgs physics .",
    "in such models the gravitational interactions occur at a scale @xmath38 , which can be as small as a @xmath3 .",
    "the extra @xmath39 dimensions are then compactified on a torus of radius @xmath40 .",
    "this leads to a relationship between newton s constant , @xmath41 , and the other scales , @xmath42 these models have a tower of very light kaluza klein excitations which couple weakly to ordinary matter ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "however , the density of the light kaluza klein modes is high ( for large @xmath40 ) and so the collective interactions build up to electroweak strength . at tree level ,",
    "the contributions of the spin-@xmath44 kaluza klein modes to @xmath45 are suppressed by @xmath46 , so only the spin @xmath47 states are relevant here .",
    "it is straightforward to find the effective @xmath48fermion and @xmath49 interactions due to the graviton exchanges which contribute to @xmath2.@xcite for @xmath50 , we have @xmath51[l]{$p^\\prime$}/}-{\\makebox[.2ex][l]{$q^\\prime$}/ } ) u(p )      { \\overline v}(p^\\prime)({\\makebox[.2ex][l]{$p$}/}- { \\makebox[.2ex][l]{$q$}/ } ) v(q^\\prime ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + ( p - q)\\cdot ( p^\\prime - q^\\prime){\\overline u}(q ) \\gamma^\\mu u(p )      { \\overline u}(p^\\prime)\\gamma_\\mu v(q^\\prime)\\biggr\\}~~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while for @xmath52 , the effective interaction is , @xmath53[l]{$p_{h_1}$}/}~~ u(p)~~.\\ ] ] the constant @xmath54 represents the effect of the sum over all the kaluza klein modes ( with masses @xmath55 ) and is given by@xcite @xmath56    calculating the complete rate for @xmath57 , including the standard model interactions , the new interactions of eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , and the relevant interference terms , gives the rates in the add scenario shown in fig . 2 for @xmath58 extra dimensions .",
    "at @xmath59 , the rate can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude if the gravitational interactions are at the @xmath60 scale .",
    "the energy distribution of the higgs boson , @xmath61 , is slightly shifted to lower values of @xmath62 by the presence of the gravitational interactions .",
    "the process @xmath63 provides a sensitive probe of new physics effects .",
