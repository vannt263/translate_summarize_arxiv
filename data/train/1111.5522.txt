    "calculating collective excitations in nonfrustrated but interacting spin systems may be considered as one of the few extremely successful stories in solving the strongly correlated electron systems . independently on whether the approach which is used to calculate such excitations stems from the linear spin wave theory ( for ordered states ) or the bethe ansatz solutions ( for quantum disordered states in 1d ) , a remarkable qualitative and quite often also quantitative agreement with a number of experimental results is usually achieved , see e.g.  @xcite .    on the other hand , collective excitations in interacting",

    "systems have attracted much less attention of the community , primarily due to experimental problems in detecting the collective orbital excitations ( orbitons ) @xcite .",
    "_ a priori _ , excitations in the orbital degree of freedom of mott insulators should behave in a similar manner as those of the spin sector : in both cases the large coulomb repulsion in the mott insulators ` freezes ' the charge degrees of freedom and largely reduces the effective low energy hilbert space so that instead of electrons it is given by spin or orbital ( pseudospin ) degrees of freedom . in place of the ` spin - wave theory ' for magnetic excitations",
    ", one would then use ` orbital - wave theory '  @xcite .",
    "it has recently been shown  @xcite , however , that this orbital - wave picture does not hold in many realistic systems . here , we prove that in a generic 2d kugel - khomskii ( kk ) spin - orbital model @xcite with the antiferromagnetic ( af ) and ferroorbital ( fo ) ground state the linear orbital wave theory breaks down and one needs to explicitly take care of the coupling between spins and orbitals .",
    "furthermore , we show that for realistic parameters of the kk hamiltonian , the dispersion of the coherent excitation changes qualitatively and reflects the two - site unit cell of the antiferromagnetic background , in contrast to expectations based on linear orbital - wave theory .",
    "the hamiltonian of the generic 2d kk model that we want to study describes a two - orbital system with orbital - conserving hopping and reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) are the spin ( pseudospin ) operators which fulfill the su(2 ) algebra and @xmath3 is the superexchange constant which describes the interaction of @xmath4 spins and @xmath5 ( orbital ) pseudospins . besides , @xmath6 is the crystal field which is implicitly assumed to be so large that in the ground state @xmath7 of @xmath8 only one type of orbital is occupied ( the fo order of orbitals ) and consequently there is long - range af order in temperature @xmath9 .",

    "@xcite ) by mean - field decoupling of spins and orbitals and by : ( i ) introducing the holstein - primakoff bosons for orbital pseudospins ( cf . ref .",

    "the spectrum consists of a single quasiparticle peak with a relatively large dispersion , cf .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) for the spectrum along the high symmetry direction @xmath23 in the brillouin zone .",
    "however , it was shown in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite that the above mean - field decoupling of spins and orbitals does not lead to a reliable description of orbital dynamics in a coupled spin - orbital system .",
    "therefore , following ref .",
    "@xcite and using _",

    "( [ eq : spectraltj ] ) was calculated using the self - consistent born approximation on @xmath31 sites ( which gives results in very good agreement with the exact diagonalization studies , cf .",

    "the bandwidth @xmath32 of the coherent orbiton peak , as obtained from fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) or from perturbative calculations cf .",
    "@xcite , is @xmath33 ( for @xmath34 ) and thus somewhat smaller than the mean - field one for which @xmath35 . in more striking contrast to the mean - field results , the dispersion has a minimum at @xmath36 instead of @xmath37 , as a result of the coupling between orbitons and the af ` background ' .    in many realistic cases , the spin - orbital model ( [ eq : h ] )",
    "has to be modified to account for the different hoppings for electrons in the two active orbitals .",
    "we have verified that the effective hopping @xmath11 is then no longer @xmath38 but instead @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote the bare hopping of an electron in orbital 1 and 2 and @xmath42 is the on - site hubbard repulsion .",
    "furthermore , quite often the hopping of the occupied orbital ( defined below as orbital 1 ) is larger , as the gain in hybridization energy contributes to its energy gain with respect to the empty orbital , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "for example for copper oxides with an occupied @xmath44 orbital and empty @xmath45 orbital , @xmath46 and thus @xmath47 since @xmath48 . in the orbital - wave picture ,",
    "the dispersion width is then likewise reduced by a factor of two to @xmath49 , but the effect is stronger in the interacting @xmath11-@xmath3 model , where we find @xmath50 , cf . fig .",

    "artist s view of the defects ( springs ) in the spin background ( up and down arrows ) created by the moving orbiton ( bold oval ) .",
    "only if these defects are healed by quantum fluctuations the orbiton can move coherently  otherwise , the orbiton is trapped in a string - like potential , see text . ]",
    "let us now try to understand the physical origin of these large differences between the orbiton motion obtained in the mean - field approximation and in a far more exact way ( i.e. via mapping onto the effective @xmath11@xmath3 model ) , cf .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . as in the mean - field case",
    "the orbiton moves freely and does not excite any spin excitations , the whole effect of the spin background is taken into account by renormalizing the superexchange constant @xmath3 into its reduced value @xmath51 .",
    "this stays in contrast with the result obtained from the mapping onto the @xmath11@xmath3 model : now the orbiton is effectively a ` hole ' in the af spin background which , when moving , flips the spins of the 2d af , cf .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "in fact , the further the orbiton moves the more spin flips ( defects in 2d af ) it excites which leads to the so - called string - like potential acting on the orbiton , cf .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the orbiton can then move coherently only due to the presence of quantum spin fluctuations in the ground state which ` heal ' these defects , ` attach ' to the orbiton and jointly move as an orbiton quasiparticle on a renormalized scale ( cf . ref .",
    "@xcite with the hole in 2d af moving effectively as a spin polaron ) .",
    "we also note that this result is entirely different from that in the 1d case  @xcite , where the orbital flip excitation fractionalizes into free spinon and orbiton quasiparticles , similar to decay of a doped hole into spinon and holon .",
    "in summary , we showed that a single orbital excitation in the 2d af and fo ground state moves similarly to a hole in the 2d af state .",
    "therefore , it can only be mobile by coupling to the spin fluctuations which leads to a minimum in the orbiton dispersion for the @xmath52 point in the brillouin zone and to the very strong renormalization of the orbiton bandwidth . in particular ,",
    "in the realistic case which can correspond to the @xmath53 excitations in copper oxides , the orbiton bandwidth is of the order of @xmath54 which explains why typically such @xmath53 excitations in the af ground state are nearly dispersionless and can be well modelled using quantum chemistry calculations on small clusters @xcite .",
