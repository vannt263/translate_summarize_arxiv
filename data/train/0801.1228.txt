    "hydrogen deficient central stars of planetary nebulae ( cspn ) are generally divided in three main groups : [ wr ] , pg 1159 and [ wc]-pg 1159 stars . however , besides these classes , there is the `` weak emission line stars '' ( wels or [ wels ] ) group , which was introduced in the extensive observational study presented by tylenda et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .",
    "although a considerably advance in the understanding of the origin and evolution of [ wr ] , [ wc]-pg 1159 and pg 1159 stars have been achieved in the last decade ( see e.g. werner & herwig 2006 ) , the evolutionary status of the wels remains an open question .",
    "motivated by the fact that only a few studies have been done focusing these objects , and that most of them were done in the optical part of the spectrum , we have investigated the uv spectra of all wels with available iue data .",
    "moreover , we have applied the non lte expanding atmosphere code cmfgen to model the uv and optical spectra of one wels , namely , hen 2 - 12 .",
    "we have used the mast database to retrieve all the data available for the wels from the iue satellite .",
    "the total number of objects currently known is about 50 , but only about 40% of this population was observed by the iue .",
    "for all the details regarding the uv analysis , we refer the reader to the complete results published in marcolino et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .    instead of presenting a homogeneous set of features",
    ", we found that the wels could be divided in three different groups : 1 ) strong p - cygni profiles ( mainly in c iv 1549 ) ; ( 2 ) weak p - cygni feature in c iv 1549 and ( 3 ) absence of p - cygni profiles . in the case of group",
    "( 3 ) , the lines are very intense and most likely of nebular origin .",
    "we have compared the uv spectra of the wels with the uv spectra of the two prototypes of the [ wc]-pg 1159 class : a30 and a78 .",
    "these two objects present simultaneous intense p - cygni emissions of n v 1238 , o v 1371 and c iv 1549 .",
    "in contrast , in the wels , the o v 1371 line is weak or absent .",
    "the same is true for n v 1238 in some objects .",
    "it is also conspicuous that the p - cygni profiles in a30 and a78 present a broader absorption than in the wels spectra .",
    "these characteristics indicate that the wels are not [ wc]-pg 1159 stars , in contrast with previous claims in the literature ( see parthasarathy et al .",
    "1998 ) on the basis of optical spectra . however , the situation is not clear for the stars ngc 6543 , ngc 6567 , and ngc 6572 .",
    "they present simultaneous p - cygni emissions of n v 1238 , o v 1371 and c iv 1549 , but considerably lower terminal velocities than the ones found for a30 and a78 ( see marcolino et al .",
    "2007 for more details ) .      after the spectral comparison between the wels and the [ wc]-pg 1159 stars a30 and a78 , we have derived wind terminal velocities ( @xmath0 ) for all objects presenting p - cygni profiles in n v 1238 and/or c iv 1549 .",
    "as most of the data available are of low resolution , we have used the calibration provided by prinja ( 1994 ) .",
    "for spectra of high resolution , the standard procedure to measure @xmath0 was used .",
    "our results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ vinfres ] , along with data for [ wce ] , [ wcl ] and pg 1159 stars , obtained from koesterke ( 2001 ) .",
    "as it is clear from the figure , the @xmath0 distribution for the wels stand mainly between the early and late type [ wr ] stars distribution .",
    "moreover , the wels have much lower terminal velocities than the [ wc]-pg 1159 and pg 1159 stars .",
    "a way to cast light in the evolutionary status of the wels , is through the modeling of their spectra . in this manner",
    ", we can obtain their physical parameters and chemical abundances .",
    "thereafter , their place in the h - r diagram could be estimated and a better comparison to other hydrogen deficient cspn could be made .",
    "our first efforts in this direction have been made by the analysis of the star hen 2 - 12 .",
    "we used the non lte expanding atmosphere code of hillier & miller ( 1998 ; cmfgen ) to model the spectrum of this star from the uv to the optical .",
    "our fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fitcmfgen ] .",
    "several lines are not reproduced , since they are nebular emissions ( they are indicated by `` neb '' in the figure ) .",
    "the physical parameters derived from the fit are : @xmath1 yr@xmath2 ( clumped model , f=0.1 ) ; @xmath3 km s@xmath2 ; @xmath4 ; @xmath5kk .",
    "a chemical abundance of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , ( % by mass ) was adopted .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ fitcmfgen ] that the fit is not perfect .",
    "some c iv absorptions are predicted in the optical , and are not observed . despite these problems ,",
    "the fit provides valuable informations .",
    "the weak absorption lines left to the blend in 4650 , are found to be due to n v. furthermore , the lack of model emissions in the 4650 blend , suggest that these emissions could have a nebular origin .",
    "more test models are currently being computed .",
    "we have investigated the uv spectra of all wels with available iue data .",
    "we have found that they can be divided in three different groups : ( 1 ) strong p - cygni profiles ( mainly in c iv 1549 ) ; ( 2 ) weak p - cygni features and ( 3 ) absence of p - cygni profiles .",
    "we have derived terminal velocities for all objects presenting p - cygni profiles in n v 1238 and/or c",
    "iv 1549 in a homogeneous way .",
    "both the @xmath0 measurements and the uv characteristics observed indicate that the wels are not [ wc]-pg 1159 stars .",
    "we have presented first non lte expanding atmosphere models for the star hen 2 - 12 .",
    "optical line fits are presented for the first time .",
    "although interesting results could be obtained , in order to make an efficient comparison to the [ wr ] and pg 1159 classes , and to gain insight to the evolutionary status of the wels , we clearly need an analysis of a large sample .",
