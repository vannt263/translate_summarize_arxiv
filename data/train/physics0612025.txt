    "in general , the discovery or emergence of something depends on the combination of several parameters , all of them having to be _ simultaneously _ met .",
    "one may think of economy , where the production of a good depends on the production or existence of other goods ( e.g. to produce a car one needs the wheel , the motor and some fioritures ) . in return , this new discovery opens new possibilities and needs that will lead to the production of yet new goods ( e.g. the simultaneous existence of the car and of alcohol directly leads to the invention of the air bag ) .",
    "this auto - catalytic process is a very general process @xcite and obviously applies to many situations not only related to innovation , but also to evolution , opinion formation , food chains etc .",
    "one may even think of the dynamics of scientific ideas , music genres , or any other field where the emergence of a new element possibly leads to new combinations and new elements .",
    "this feedback is responsible for the potential explosion of the number of items , such as observed e.g. in the cambrian explosion ) .",
    "explosion  has been shown to be identical of a phase transition in a van der waals gas @xcite .",
    "after mapping the above catalytic reactions onto a network structure , where nodes represent items and directed links show which items are necessary for the production of others , it is tempting to introduce a unanimity rule ( ur ) : a node on the network is activated only if all the nodes arriving to it through a link are activated .",
    "surprisingly , the dynamics of such an unanimity rule , that is a straightforward generalization of the usual majority rules of opinion dynamics @xcite , is poorly known @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we are interested on the spreading dynamics of the ur and try to understand which conditions have to be satisfied so that the network gets fully activated in the long time limit .",
    "the network is composed of @xmath0 nodes related through directed links .",
    "each node exists in one of two states : activated or inactivated .",
    "the number of nodes with indegree @xmath1 ( the indegree of a node is defined to be the number of links arriving to it ) is denoted by @xmath2 and depends on the underlying network structure .",
    "initially ( at @xmath3 ) there are @xmath4 nodes which are activated , among which @xmath5 have an indegree @xmath1 . in general , the number of nodes of type @xmath1 , activated at time @xmath6 , is @xmath7 .",
    "it is also useful to introduce the quantities @xmath8 and @xmath9 which are the proportions of nodes of type @xmath1 in the network ( indegree distribution ) and the probability that such a node @xmath1 is activated , respectively .",
    "@xmath10 is the fraction of activated nodes in the whole network at time @xmath6 .",
    "the unanimity rule is defined as follows ( see fig.1 ) . at each time step , each node is considered .",
    "if all the links arriving to a specific unactivated node @xmath1 originate at nodes which are activated at @xmath11 , @xmath1 gets activated at @xmath6 .",
    "otherwise , it remains unactivated .",
    "the process is applied iteratively until the system reaches a stationary state , characterized by an asymptotic value @xmath12 . in the following , we are interested in the relation between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , i.e. what is the final occupation of the network as a function of its initial occupation on a specific network .",
    "let us mention the fact that each node may be produced by only _",
    "one _ combination of ( potentially many , depending on the indegree ) nodes .",
    "this is a modification of the model of hanel et al .",
    "@xcite , where more than one pairs of ( two ) nodes could produce new elements and will lead to a different equation for the activation evolution , as shown below .",
    "the dynamics studied here implies that nodes with a higher indegree will be activated with a probability smaller than those with a smaller indegree ( because the former have more conditions to be fulfilled ) .",
    "let us now derive an evolution equation for @xmath7 and @xmath14 . to do so it is helpful to consider the first time step and than to iterate .",
    "there are initially @xmath4 activated nodes , @xmath15 of them being of indegree @xmath1 on average ( the activated nodes are randomly chosen in the beginning ) .",
    "the ensemble of @xmath5 nodes is called the initial set of indegree @xmath1 . by construction ,",
    "the probability that @xmath1 randomly chosen nodes are activated , is @xmath16 ( @xmath1 is an exponent ) .",
    "consequently , the average number of nodes with indegree @xmath1 and who respect the unanimity rule is @xmath17 while the number of such nodes that are not yet occupied is @xmath18 and , on average , the total number of occupied nodes with indegree @xmath1 evolves as : @xmath19 let us stress that we have implicitely assumed that there are no indegree correlations between neighboring nodes in order to derive eq.[delta0 ] . at the next time step ,",
    "the average number of nodes with indegree @xmath1 , who respect the unanimity rule and who are outside the initial set is @xmath20 . among those nodes ,",
    "@xmath21 have already been activated during the first time step , so that the average number of nodes who get activated at the second time step is : @xmath22 note that eq.[delta1 ] is valid because no node in @xmath23 also belongs to @xmath24 .",
    "this is due to the fact that each node can only be activated by _ one _ combination of @xmath1 nodes in our model , so that no redundancy is possible between @xmath23 and @xmath24 . by proceeding similarly , it is straightforward to show that the contributions @xmath25 read @xmath26 with @xmath27 by convention .",
    "the number of activated nodes evolve as @xmath28 by dividing by @xmath2 , one gets a set of equations for the proportion of nodes @xmath29 $ ] : @xmath30 where the coupling between the different proportions @xmath31 occurs through the average value @xmath32 , as defined above .",
    "finally , by multiplying by the indegree distribution @xmath33 and summing over all values of @xmath1 , one gets a closed equation for the average proportion of activated nodes in the network that reads @xmath34 let us stress that eq.[equation ] is non - linear as soon as @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , it is characterized by the non - trivial presence of the initial condition @xmath13 in the right hand non - linear term and is therefore highly non - local in time .",
    "eq.[equation ] explicitly shows how the indegree distribution @xmath33 , affects the propagation of activated nodes in the system .",
    "in this section , we focus on simple choices of @xmath33 in order to apprehend analytically the behavior of eq.[equation ] .",
    "the simplest case is @xmath37 for which eq.[equation ] reads @xmath38 this equation is solved by recurrence : @xmath39\\cr & = & a_{0 } + ( 1-a_{0 } )   a_0 + ( 1-a_{0})^2   a_0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and in general @xmath40 this last expression is easily verified : @xmath41 the above solution implies that any initial condition converges toward the asymptotic state @xmath42 , i.e. whatever the initial condition , the system is fully activated in the long time limit .",

    "two choices are possible .",

    "the choise is a question of interpretation .",

    "it is worth noting that the importance of nodes with zero incoming links is much higher in ( growing ) barabasi - albert like networks ( fig.4 ) , so that the difference between the two versions is quite pronounced , as expected .",
    "let us also mention that eq.14 has been successfully verified for a random network where the indegree of each node is exactly 2 ( @xmath47 ) , as shown in fig.2 .",
    "in this letter , we have introduced a simple model for innovation whose dynamics is based on unanimity rule .",
    "it is shown that the discovery of new items on the underlying network opens perspectives for the discovery of new items .",
    "this feedback effect may lead to complex spreading properties , embodied by the existence of a _ critical size _ for the initial activation , that is necessary for the complete activation of the network in the long time limit .",
    "the problem has been analyzed empirically on a large variety of network structures and has been successfully described by recurrence relations for the average activation .",
    "let us stress that these recurrence relations have a quite atypical form , due to their explicit dependence on the initial conditions .",
    "moreover , their non - linearity makes them a hard problem to solve in general .",
    "finally , let us insist on the fact that unanmity rule is a general mechanism that should apply to numerous situations related to innovation , opinion dynamics or even species / population dynamics . to be consistent with our own work",
