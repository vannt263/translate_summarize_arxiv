    "may lead to peculiar many - body ground states and exotic collective excitations , rarely appearing in interacting electron systems @xcite .",
    "for example , the cooper pair structures in such high spin fermions are enriched : a kind of quintet pairing can be formed as an so(5 ) polar condensate @xcite . in one dimension , the competing so(5 ) superfluid order has been investigated based on the bosonization technique @xcite , and an exact bethe - ansatz method tsvelik-2006 has also been used to describe the corresponding low - energy states . furthermore , a spin-3/2 ladder model has been proposed with spontaneous plaquette ground state @xcite .    out of these intensive studies , mott insulating states of ultracold atoms in optical lattices are of particular interest .",
    "with a fixed number of atoms on each lattice site , the quantum fluctuations of the hyperfine spin degrees of freedom may lead to magnetic multipolar long - range order .",

    "adiabatically increasing optical lattice trap depth , these systems go through a quantum superfluid - mott insulator phase transition .",
    "the atomic virtual tunneling processes can result in effective hyperfine spin - exchange interactions between the nearest neighbor sites .",
    "in particular , an insulating spin - quadrupole or spin nematic ordering has been proposed for spin-1 bosons in optical lattices demler - zhou-2002,demler-2003,zhou-2004 .",

    "when @xmath231 , the original spin-@xmath0 hubbard model displays an su(4 ) symmetry @xcite , and here we have @xmath232 .",
    "then the effective spin - exchange interaction becomes@xmath233 , \\]]with@xmath234this effective spin model also exhibits a uniform su(4 ) symmetry . in one dimension ,",
    "an exact solution had been obtained by the bethe ansatz method sutherland-1975 , and the ground state of the su(4 ) spin - exchange model is a spin singlet with gapless spin excitations .",
    "moreover , such a spin-@xmath56 exchange hamiltonian is equivalent to the so - called su(4 ) spin - orbital model , which has been extensively studied in solid - state systems spin - orbit .",
    "more interesting and complicated situations occur for a mott insulator with two interacting atoms per site . now",
    "the possible ground states on each site may depend on the spin dependent coupling parameter @xmath32 . in the limit of @xmath188 ,",
    "the single site state is a spin singlet ( @xmath235 ) for @xmath236 and a spin quintet ( @xmath237 ) for @xmath238 .",
    "however , a small finite tunneling induces an exchange energy of order @xmath239 between the nearest neighbor sites . since the energy difference between the spin singlet and quintet states is given by @xmath32 , when @xmath239 is large compared with the absolute value of @xmath32 , the quintet state is mixed with the singlet state , and both spin configurations of these two states have to be taken into account in the second - order perturbation calculations . however , in the present section we will not consider this situation and simply assume @xmath240 .",
    "the discussion is divided into two parts .      in this case",
    ", the two - site unperturbed ground state corresponds to the site singlet state @xmath241 , and the allowed intermediate states are@xmath242according to the initial state , only the total spin @xmath16 channel is involved .",
    "the two - site unperturbed and intermediate states are expressed as@xmath243and the corresponding intermediate state with @xmath244 .",
    "after some algebra , the energy shift is calculated as@xmath245then , up to a constant , the effective lattice model is obtained as@xmath246where @xmath247 is the singlet projection operator between two site singlet states , which can not be expressed in terms of powers of hyperfine spin exchanges . in this sense , the functional integral approach developed in sec .",
    "iii is a more appropriate method to attack this problem .      in this case",
    "the two - site unperturbed ground state is described by the quintet state @xmath248 .",
    "two intermediate states have been given in ( [ intermediate ] ) , but the total spin @xmath249 channels have to be considered , as the virtual tunneling process is forbidden in the @xmath250 channel due to the pauli s exclusion principle . with the help of the clebsch - gordon coefficients , the unperturbed two - site ground states with maximal spin polarization are written as@xmath251the intermediate states in total spin @xmath16 channel have been expressed as ( [ spin0 ] ) , while the other intermediate states in channel @xmath252 are expressed as@xmath253and corresponding intermediate states with interchange @xmath244 .",
    "it is sufficient to calculate the energy shifts with these maximal spin polarized states .",
    "the final results are obtained as@xmath254note that up to the second order of @xmath40 , the total spin @xmath39 channel makes no contribution to the energy shift .",
    "hence , the resulting effective spin interaction for the lattice model reads up to a constant@xmath255 \\right\\ } , \\]]where @xmath225 projects the @xmath256 states onto the total spin-@xmath19 states .",
    "they are given by    @xmath257    with @xmath258 $ ] .",
    "moreover , the effective spin - exchange model hamiltonian can be simply written as@xmath259 .\\]]here we would like to emphasize that the spin operators correspond to @xmath39 operators .",
    "to summarize , a functional integral approach has been applied to study the quantum spin - quadrupole long - range ordered state of the mott insulating phase in the generalized half filled spin-@xmath0 hubbard model for the case @xmath260 . on a square lattice",
    ", the ground state shows a staggered spin - quadrupole long - range order from the saddle - point solution of the effective action . by including the gaussian fluctuations ,",
    "the four gapless collective modes have been found , corresponding to the spin - quadrupole density waves . unlike spin density waves in the half filled spin-@xmath261 hubbard model ,",
    "the spin - quadrupole density wave velocity is saturated in the limit of @xmath262 , because the transverse mode couplings of the spin - quadrupole collective excitations are not allowed by the so(4 ) invariant effective action .",
    "thus , our results obtained under the gaussian approximation for the spin - quadrupole ordered state are robust even when the high order fluctuations are included .",
    "this is a remarkable property of the enlarged hyperfine spin space dimensionality and the higher symmetry of the local interactions in the generalized spin-@xmath0 hubbard model .",
    "moreover , the effective hyperfine spin - exchange interactions for the quarter filled and half filled cases have been derived from the second - order perturbation theory . starting from these effective spin - exchange interactions , more efficient treatments may be carried out to characterize these multipolar magnetic states .",
    "further investigations in this regard will be reported elsewhere .",
