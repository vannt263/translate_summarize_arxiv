    "honeycomb materials offer an attractive path to the realization of a chiral spin - singlet superconducting state .",
    "the sixfold rotation symmetry of the honeycomb lattice makes the two @xmath3-wave solutions , favored for electron - driven superconductivity in proximity to an antiferromagnetic state , degenerate , and thus a time - reversal symmetry breaking and fully gapped @xmath6-wave state ( or short @xmath7 ) is very generally preferred.@xcite this state is characterized by the phase of the order parameter winding twice around the brillouin zone center with the chirality defined by the sign of the imaginary part , which functions as a definition of a topological invariant.@xcite due to the bulk - boundary correspondence , open boundaries necessarily host a pair of co - propagating , or chiral , edge states.@xcite    one natural material to realize the @xmath8-wave state is graphene.@xcite both largely phenomenological models@xcite and different renormalization group ( rg ) techniques@xcite have found a @xmath8 superconducting state in doped graphene , in particular close to the van hove singularity at quarter filling . in recent years the layered honeycomb lithium- and sodium iridates , li@xmath0iro@xmath1 and na@xmath0iro@xmath1 , have also generated significant experimental and theoretical interest.@xcite in these materials the lattice geometry combines with strong spin - orbit coupling and strong correlations to possibly generate a quantum spin liquid state with majorana excitations interesting for quantum computation@xcite in the undoped state . from the viewpoint of superconductivity , theoretical studies have found that doping these materials can also give a spin - triplet @xmath9-wave state , possibly topologically non - trivial,@xcite competing with the spin - singlet chiral @xmath3-wave state.@xcite a finite momentum pairing state has also been discussed.@xcite    very recently , lithium iridate has also been synthesized in two other crystal structures which have been dubbed hyperhoneycomb  @xcite and stripyhoneycomb.@xcite these are envisioned to be the two smallest members of a series of 3d lattices called the harmonic honeycomb lattices , which can be viewed as regions of honeycomb lattice twisted against each other to form a truly 3d structure . in the past few years , there have been many experimental and theoretical studies of these materials in the context of magnetism , with the hope of finding a quantum spin liquid ground state.@xcite other proposals of exotic physics on these lattices include a weyl spin liquid@xcite and line nodes.@xcite    despite the large interest in the strongly correlated ground state of the undoped harmonic honeycomb materials , the possibility for superconductivity upon doping has so far not been explored . because the larger members of the harmonic honeycomb series consist of large honeycomb regions , the chiral @xmath7-wave symmetry should realistically be very competitive for any spin - singlet superconducting state . however , all harmonic honeycomb lattices globally break the sixfold rotation symmetry and thus the intrinsic 3d nature should also significantly influence superconductivity , which makes the resulting state hard to predict . in this work",
    "we study the possible spin - singlet superconducting states in the doped harmonic honeycomb lattice series .",
    "we start with investigating an isolated twist separating two large honeycomb regions .",
    "indeed , we find that the @xmath10 state is stabilized on both sides of the twist for all but very high doping levels .",
    "the relative chirality between both sides is not constrained by the twist and each twist host a total of four chiral edge states .",
    "the twist thus largely acts as an effective open boundary although we find that it allows for hybridization between the chiral edge states , such that they form 2d dispersive states in the twist plane . adding twists periodically and subsequently systematically reducing the size of the honeycomb regions , we observe pair breaking in the @xmath11 channel .",
    "this leads to the destruction of the chiral @xmath7-wave state below a critical size of the harmonic honeycomb lattice .",
    "the remaining order parameter does not completely coincide with the @xmath12 state either , since sixfold rotation symmetry is not fully preserved .",
    "studying the smallest members of the harmonic honeycomb lattice series , the hyper- and stripyhoneycomb lattice , we discover that the superconducting order parameter instead forms a nodal state belonging to the trivial representation .",
    "the formation of nodal lines is possible even in the trivial representation because the full lattice symmetry allows for sign changes between certain set of bonds .",
    "other orders found in certain parts of the phase diagram include time - reversal symmetry broken states , which are either fully gapped or feature nodal points .",
    "very large doping always leads to a fully gapped extended @xmath13-wave state throughout the whole harmonic honeycomb series .",
    "this article is structured in the following way . in section  [ sec : lattice ]",
    "we build up the harmonic honeycomb lattices from a simple starting point - the twist .",
    "we then introduce the model in section  [ sec : model ] . in section  [ sec :",
    "twist ] , we study an isolated twist and investigate the properties of the twist edge states . the pair breaking effect of a periodic structure with varying distances between twists is investigated in section  [ sec : interm ] .",
    "we then perform a symmetry analysis of the smallest members of the harmonic honeycomb series in section  [ sec : hypstrip ] and calculate their superconducting phase diagrams .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : connection ] , we build upon the observed behaviors and draw conclusions for all members of the harmonic honeycombs , before we summarize our results in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the harmonic honeycomb lattices are tri - coordinated 3d lattices that are related to the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the honeycomb lattice has the nearest neighbor vectors @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , in units of the nearest neighbor distance @xmath17 ( which we will use as the unit of length ) and as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattices](a ) . in order to produce the harmonic honeycomb lattices , some of the zigzag bonds @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( red bonds in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattices ] ) are rotated out of the @xmath20 plane by an angle @xmath21 to instead yield @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( blue bonds in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattices ] ) . the straight nearest neighbor vector @xmath24 ( black bonds in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattices ] ) is still the same throughout the lattice .",
    "the switch from the unprimed to the primed nearest neighbor vectors occurs at a fixed @xmath25-position and parallel to the @xmath26 and @xmath27-directions .",
    "we call this lattice change a  twist \" as is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattices](b ) .        at a twist ,",
    "a plane spanned by the @xmath18 and @xmath19 vectors is connected to infinitely many parallel planes spanned by the primed zigzag vectors and vice versa .",
    "thus the rotation of @xmath28 and @xmath29 out of the @xmath20 plane creates a fully 3d lattice .",
    "the resulting twist structure always has a periodicity in the @xmath30 plane with lattice vectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattices](b ) .",
    "the reciprocal lattice vectors for this plane are @xmath33 and @xmath34 , resulting in a first brillouin zone depicted in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : isolatedtwistspectrum ]",
    ".    the twist can also be periodically repeated at different @xmath25 positions , creating an infinite amount of possible lattice structures  the harmonic honeycomb lattice series .",
    "when the regions between twists consist of @xmath35 completed hexagons the resulting lattice is labeled @xmath36.@xcite figures  [ fig : lattices](c ) and ( d ) depict the two smallest members of this family : the stripyhoneycomb ( @xmath37 ) and hyperhoneycomb ( @xmath38 ) lattices .",
    "both of these structures have very recently been stabilized experimentally in lithium iridate li@xmath0iro@xmath1.@xcite in these compounds the harmonic honeycomb lattice is formed by the iridium ions , which are surrounded by oxygen octahedra .",
    "this arrangement leads to an angle of rotation @xmath39,@xcite which we adopt throughout this paper .",
    "another possibility would be the very recent proposed realization of the harmonic honeycomb lattices involving carbon atoms with @xmath40.@xcite",
    "we are here interested in the superconducting state which might occur upon doping a strongly correlated harmonic honeycomb material , having the already proposed spin - liquids li@xmath0iro@xmath1 in mind . in",
    "order to most clearly elucidate the physics of the possible superconducting states , we consider the simplest possible kinetic energy term in the harmonic honeycomb lattices appearing upon doping , consisting of a nearest neighbor hopping @xmath41 and chemical potential @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the annihilation operator on site @xmath45 with spin @xmath46 . we further consider superconductivity in the spin - singlet channel , where we capture all relevant spatial pairing symmetries by using a nearest neighbor bond pairing order parameter @xmath47 , such that the total hamiltonian reads @xmath48 exactly such a superconducting term is generated upon doping a material with an antiferromagnetic nearest neighbor heisenberg interaction @xmath49,@xcite , which has been found to be significant in the known harmonic honeycomb materials.@xcite we leave the study of the other interaction terms discussed in connection with the iridates , such as the kitaev interaction,@xcite to future work .",
    "an inclusion of such a term will introduce additional spin - triplet pairing.@xcite the superconducting order parameter is determined through the self - consistency equation @xmath50 in order to capture all possible superconducting states we solve self - consistently for the superconducting order parameter independently on each bond , with no presumed symmetry relations inbetween different bonds .",
    "the model discussed here has been studied before on the honeycomb lattice , which has a @xmath5 point group symmetry.@xcite in that case , there are three bond order parameters @xmath47 , one for each nearest neighbor bond @xmath51 . for easy treatment , they can be arranged into a vector order parameter @xmath52 . with three different bond orders there",
    "exist in total three different solutions : two @xmath3-wave order parameters , belonging to the 2d irreducible representation @xmath53 , and an extended @xmath13-wave state , which belongs to the trivial representation @xmath54.@xcite the labeling of the states refers to their behavior under the symmetry transformations of the @xmath5 point group , and is the symmetry of the intraband order parameter across the whole brillouin zone .",
    "these states can also be classified by their basis functions in real space , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "in large parts of the @xmath58 phase diagram a linear combination of the two @xmath3-waves of the form @xmath59 is stabilized at all temperatures below @xmath60 , with the two different chiralities ( @xmath61 ) being degenerate.@xcite for large doping , beyond the van hove singularity at @xmath62 , or for very strong interaction strength @xmath49 , the extended @xmath13-wave state is instead favored . in order to characterize the superconducting solutions for the harmonic honeycomb lattices",
    "it is useful to define an overlap of the order parameter as @xmath63 for the different order parameter symmetries @xmath25 of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "in the limit of large distances between twists , the superconducting order parameter of the harmonic honeycombs should be very similar to that of a regular honeycomb lattice . to study this hypothesis",
    ", we set up a slab , which is periodic in the @xmath26- and @xmath27-direction but has open boundary conditions in the @xmath25-direction .",
    "we use a slab of length @xmath64 and add a single twist at @xmath65 .",
    "this is an extended version of the lattice in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattices](b ) . to the left of the twist ,",
    "the zigzag bonds are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , to the right they are @xmath28 and @xmath29 . this way the twist connects two stacks of honeycomb lattice with different normal vectors .",
    "we characterize the order parameter at each site by the three nearest neighbor bond order parameters around it and calculate the overlap with the three basis functions of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "first , we study if the @xmath10 state can be stabilized in the regions on each side of the twist .",
    "we therefore fix the parameters to @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which places the system firmly within the @xmath10 region ( from here on we measure all energies in units of @xmath41 , if not explicitly stated otherwise ) .",
    "these parameters lead to the largest order parameter strength within the @xmath10 region.@xcite this also guarantees a short coherence length for the superconducting state , minimizing the effects of edges  @xcite and thus enables us to restrict the calculations to smaller system sizes .",
    "we have carefully checked our conclusions with other parameter sets within the @xmath10 region , especially for lower chemical potential @xmath42 .",
    "figure  [ fig : isolatedtwistoverlap ] shows the overlap of the calculated order parameter with the honyecomb lattice basis functions as a function of position .",
    "the twist is clearly visible in the center of the figure .",
    "far away from the twists , at the center of the regions , the calculated order parameter shows a 100% overlap with the @xmath68 state to the left of the twist and with the @xmath69 state to the right .",
    "furthermore , the strength of the order parameter in the middle of the regions agrees well with the value of a bulk honeycomb system . far away from the twist ,",
    "the system thus clearly behaves like a regular honeycomb lattice . on the honeycomb lattice , the @xmath68 and @xmath69 states are degenerate .",
    "we find no energy difference when changing the chirality on either side of the twist .",
    "thus the chirality of two regions separated by a single twist is completely independent .    , @xmath70 , and extended-@xmath13 basis functions at each atomic site for an isolated twist in the middle of a 150 long slab .",
    "far away from the twist , the results of the honeycomb lattice are recovered and the overlap with the @xmath10 states reaches 100% .",
    "both the twist and the open outer edges lift the degeneracy of the @xmath3-wave solutions , thus destroying the @xmath10 state .",
    "[ fig : isolatedtwistoverlap ] ]    another result that directly carries over from the 2d honeycomb lattice is the suppression of the @xmath11 state on the open outer boundaries of the slab , destroying the @xmath10 state.@xcite at the same time , the @xmath12 state is enhanced and a small overlap with the extended @xmath13-wave state is also observed near the edges .",
    "this has been explained by noting that @xmath71 in both the @xmath12 and extended @xmath13-wave states , which respects the translational symmetry of the zigzag edge . on the other hand , in the @xmath11 state @xmath72 , which makes it energetically unfavorable on a zigzag edge and thus the zigzag edge",
    "is pair breaking for the @xmath11 state .",
    "we find that the order parameter around the twist behaves in a very similar way .",
    "the @xmath10 state is destroyed near the twist bonds because of the suppression of the @xmath11 state , but it recovers in a fashion very similar to what is observed near the open outer zigzag edges .",
    "the order parameter also shows a finite overlap with the extended @xmath13-wave state at the twist .",
    "moreover , the magnitude of @xmath73 is reduced to about a quarter of the bulk value on the bond that bridges the twist .",
    "the @xmath10 superconducting state has a chern number of @xmath74 , due to the winding of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "thus all edges should host a pair of co - propagating , or chiral , edge states.@xcite figure  [ fig : isolatedtwistldos ] displays the local density of states ( ldos ) as a function of position .",
    "in addition to the expected edge states on the open outer boundaries , there are also subgap states visible at the twist .",
    "interestingly , this behavior is observed independently of the chiralities of the two regions separated by the twist .",
    "here we note that the chern number is only defined in 2d and the twist creates a boundary between two 2d systems with different orientations only connected in isolated points , which motivates why the ground state is not sensitive to the chirality of the states on each side of the twist .    ]    in total we expect eight chiral edge states for a slab with a single twist ; two at the left edge , four around the twist , and two more at the right edge .",
    "cutting the brillouin zone in the direction of @xmath75 reveals four states crossing the gap in fig .",
    "[ fig : isolatedtwistspectrum ] ( red lines ) .",
    "two of the states do not change when looking at a parallel cut ( black lines ) .",
    "this means that they can only disperse along the honeycomb sheets corresponding to the @xmath75 direction and must thus be located at the left outer edge of the system .",
    "the subgap states at the twist , however , have the possibility to disperse in the directions of both @xmath75 and @xmath76 and we find that they change between the two cuts .",
    "this clearly highlights that the twist edge states hybridize across the twist , forming a 2d band .",
    "the two edge states on the right outer edge of the system only disperse in the @xmath76 direction .",
    "the horizontal line in the spectrum that is seen along the black cut , but not along the red cut , is such an right outer edge state . in summary , we find that a single twist acts very similar to an outer zigzag edge ; the magnitude of the order parameter is suppressed , the twist is heavily pair breaking for the @xmath11-wave order , and the twist carries two chiral edge states on each side of the twist .",
    "notably , the twist does not act as a domain wall , which would enforce a preference on the chirality of the two separated regions . at the same time the twist still allows the four chiral edge states to hybridize such that they form 2d edge bands , which is clearly different from regular 1d zigzag edges .",
    "direction through the 2d brillouin zone formed by the twist region ( see inset for cuts ) . in both cases",
    "there are four gapless states connecting the conduction and valence band .",
    "the edge states along the open outer boundaries do not change between the two cuts .",
    "the states at the twist form a 2d dispersive band , which changes between the cuts .",
    "[ fig : isolatedtwistspectrum ] ]",
    "next , we introduce periodic boundary conditions also in the @xmath25-direction and study the superconducting state with changing distance between twists . once again , we restrict the parameters to @xmath77 and @xmath78 to obtain the smallest healing length within the @xmath10 region of the honeycomb lattice . to further reduce the computational cost , we adjust the brillouin zone sampling . for distances larger than @xmath79 between the twists we sample the @xmath80 direction only at the @xmath81 point , while we still use a dense sampling for @xmath82 and @xmath83 . for smaller distances",
    "we use a regular grid in all three dimensions covering the full brillouin zone .",
    "we have carefully checked our results for other parameters and with different brillouin zone samplings .",
    "-wave solutions in the center of the regions between the twists as a function of distance between twists . for large distances",
    "the overlap with both @xmath3-wave states is equal and a perfect @xmath10 state is formed .",
    "when the distance between twists is decreased , the @xmath11-state is suppressed .",
    "[ fig : dvsl ] ]    the influence of the distance between twists is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dvsl ] , where we plot the overlap of the calculated order parameter with the two @xmath3-wave solutions at the center of the regions between twists . at large distances , the order parameter has the same overlap with both @xmath3-wave states and the system is in a perfect @xmath10 state . at some smaller distance , where the @xmath10 state is still realized ,",
    "the edge states start to hybridize across the regions , causing the opening of an energy gap in the twist edge states . for even shorter distances ,",
    "the proximity to the twist suppresses the @xmath11-state also in the center of the regions between twists .",
    "the characteristic length scale at which the degeneracy of the @xmath3-wave states is significantly lifted depends on the coherence length of the superconducting order , which in turn is determined by the strength of the coupling constant and doping . for our set of parameters , which was chosen to give a small healing length at edges ,",
    "this occurs at a distance of about @xmath79 . for other values of @xmath49 and @xmath42 within the honeycomb @xmath84 region ,",
    "the degeneracy is lifted at different distances .",
    "this suppression of the @xmath11-wave symmetry is the same as observed around the isolated twist and near the open zigzag edges . in those cases ,",
    "however , the system was large enough so that the honeycomb bulk solution was recovered far away from the twist .",
    "now , the regions between the twists are too small to at all stabilize the @xmath84 state .",
    "when the @xmath11 order is completely suppressed , the overlap with the @xmath12 order becomes very large .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : dvsl ] shows that it does not reach unity .",
    "the remaining percentage is due to the extended @xmath13-wave .",
    "when the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath42 are instead chosen in such a way , that the extended @xmath13-wave state is stabilized on the 2d honeycomb lattice , the order parameter remains in the extended @xmath13-wave state throughout the whole harmonic honeycomb series .",
    "finally , it should be noted that all these classifications are based on the @xmath5 symmetry of the full honeycomb lattice . at small distances between twists",
    ", one can no longer assume that this symmetry is fulfilled , even locally .",
    "indeed , we observe that the order parameter does no longer follow the @xmath85 behavior associated with the @xmath12 order even when the @xmath11-wave is completely suppressed . to completely understand the transition to the smallest members of the harmonic honeycomb series , we instead have to study the point group of the full 3d structure .",
    "to scrutinize the superconducting order present in the members of the harmonic honeycombs with small distances between twists , we study the two smallest members of the family , the hyper- and stripyhoneycomb lattices . both structures have been experimentally stabilized in lithium iridate compounds.@xcite    we begin with the hyperhoneycomb lattice , which has the point group @xmath4 , with the bond center of one twist bond chosen as the center of symmetry .",

    "when the distance between twists is large , there is locally an approximative six - fold symmetry",
    ". then the superconducting order can be classified with respect also to the honeycomb @xmath5 point group and the states found originally in the hyper- and stripyhoneycomb can be related to those of the honeycomb lattice . for the gapped state @xmath120 observed at large doping levels",
    "@xmath121 , the additional symmetry fixes the magnitude of the order parameter on the three bonds around each site to the same value .",
    "this is equivalent to the extended @xmath13-wave state , which is also obtained at approximately the same high doping levels in the honeycomb lattice.@xcite for lower doping levels the nodal state @xmath122 , with a relative phase of @xmath99 between horizontal and zigzag bonds , dominates the phase diagram for both the hyper- and stripyhoneycomb lattices .",
    "an exact local symmetry restricts @xmath123 , which is also the spatial basis for the @xmath12-wave of the @xmath5 point group .",
    "this explains the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : dvsl ] , where the overlap with the @xmath12-wave never quite reaches one due to this local symmetry only being approximately valid . the sign - changing zigzag bond orders of the other irreducible representations",
    "can be be related to the @xmath11 state , since it has the vector order parameter @xmath124 , which changes sign on the zigzag bonds .",
    "the time - reversal symmetry breaking order with nodal points , @xmath125 , found at low doping in the hyperhoneycomb lattice ( but not in the stripyhoneycomb ) therefore corresponds to the @xmath84 state observed throughout the phase diagram at low to moderate doping in the honeycomb lattice . in summary",
    ", we thus find that the superconducting state on the harmonic honeycomb lattices at low doping levels is related to the @xmath12-wave state of the honeycomb lattice due to the pair breaking effects of the zigzag edge on the @xmath11-state .",
    "still , in some limited regions it is possible to stabilize the equivalent of the @xmath8 state , despite the two @xmath3-wave solutions belonging to different irreducible representations for all harmonic honeycomb lattices .",
    "another feature of the phase diagrams that also appears in the honeycomb lattice is the change of order at roughly @xmath126 , from @xmath13-wave like to @xmath3-wave like .",
    "for all the members of the harmonic honeycomb lattice we have studied , some kind of feature ( either a shoulder or a clear peak ) appears at this doping level in the normal state dos , very similar to the van hove singularity found at @xmath126 in the honeycomb lattice .",
    "finally , the observed suppression of the order parameter on the bonds at the twist itself is enabled by the fact that these bonds form one group that is not related by symmetry to the any other bonds .",
    "in this work we have studied the possible spin - singlet superconducting states in harmonic honeycomb materials upon doping an heisenberg antiferromagnet ground state .",
    "we first studied an isolated twist between two separate honeycomb lattice regions , rotated out - of - plane relative to each other .",
    "here we found that the two regions of honeycomb structure separated by the twist independently stabilize the chiral @xmath84-wave solution at low to intermediate doping .",
    "the twist effectively acts as an open edge in the system , as it does not constrain the relative chirality between the two regions and it hosts a total of four edge states , two chiral states from each side of the twist .",
    "however , the twist still offers some coupling between the two regions as is evident from the edge states dispersing along both directions in reciprocal space , forming 2d edge bands . at very high doping levels ( @xmath127 )",
    ", we instead found an extended @xmath13-wave state on both sides of the twist .",
    "we then introduced periodic boundary conditions by which we could decrease the region size between the twists .",
    "we then found that the degeneracy of the two @xmath3-wave states is lifted since the zigzag edge is pair breaking for the @xmath11-wave state . when the distance between twists become too small",
    ", the @xmath5 symmetry of the honeycomb lattice is no longer preserved even locally and the superconducting state has to be classified in terms of the @xmath4 point group of the harmonic honeycomb lattice series . because there are no symmetries relating certain sets of bonds to each other in the harmonic honeycomb lattices , the bond order parameters split into several separate sets .",
    "this leads to the formation of superconducting states with nodal lines belonging to the trivial irreducible representation at low to intermediate doping in both the hyper- and stripyhoneycomb lattices .",
    "this state is the natural evolution of the @xmath12 state in the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the nodal lines can in fact be shown to be topological protected , as will be discussed elsewhere.@xcite in parts of the low - doping regime of the hyperhoneycomb phase diagram we also found a time - reversal symmetry breaking state that partly gaps out the nodal lines into nodal points .",
    "this state belongs to different irreducible representations , but is an extension of the honeycomb @xmath8-wave state . at very high doping",
    "we find a fully gapped state corresponding to an extended-@xmath13-wave state . in between the low - moderate and high doping regimes",
    "there is also an additional fully gapped time - reversal symmetry breaking state generated from the trivial representation , with no equivalence in the 2d honeycomb lattice . in aggregate",
    "these results display the evolution from a chiral and fully gapped @xmath8-wave superconducting state in the 2d honeycomb lattice to a superconducting state with nodal lines in the small members of the 3d harmonic honeycomb lattices .",
    "we are grateful to m.  hermanns and k.  le hur for discussions .",
