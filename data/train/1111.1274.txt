    "over the past decade , physicists have developed sophisticated but non - rigorous techniques for the study of random constraint satisfaction problems ( ` csps ' ) such as random @xmath0-sat or random graph @xmath0-coloring  @xcite .",
    "this work has led to a remarkably detailed _ conjectured _ picture , according to which various phase transitions affect both the combinatorial and computational nature of random problems . by now ,",
    "some of these predictions have been turned into rigorous theorems .",
    "examples include results on the `` shattering '' of the solution space  @xcite , work on ( non-)reconstruction and sampling  @xcite , and even new algorithms for random csps  @xcite .",
    "many of these contributions have led to the development of new rigorous techniques .",
    "indeed , it seems fair to say that , combined , these results have advanced our understanding of random csps quite significantly .",
    "however , thus far substantial bits of the statistical mechanics picture have eluded all rigorous attempts .",
    "perhaps most importantly , apart from a very few special cases , the precise thresholds for the existence of solutions in random csps have not been pinned down exactly . while rigorous upper and lower bounds can be derived via the _ first _ and the _ second moment method _",
    "@xcite , these bounds do not quite match in most examples , including prominent ones such as random @xmath0-sat or random graph @xmath0-coloring .",
    "in fact , the statistical mechanics techniques suggest a striking explanation for this discrepancy , namely the existence of a _ condensation phase _ shortly before the threshold for the existence of solutions . in this phase , a crucial necessary condition for the success of the ( standard ) second moment method",
    "is violated .",
    "indeed , in statistical mechanics a deep formalism called _ survey propagation _",
    "( ` sp ' ) has been developed expressly to deal with condensation . while sp is primarily an analysis technique ,",
    "an off - spin has been the _ sp guided decimation _ algorithm , which seems highly successful at solving random csps experimentally .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new _ sp - inspired second moment method _ that allows us to overcome the barrier posed by condensation .",
    "the specific problem that we work with is random @xmath0-naesat , one of the standard benchmark problems in the theory of random csps .",
    "random @xmath0-naesat is technically a bit simpler than random @xmath0-sat due to a certain symmetry property , but computationally and structurally both problems have strong similarities .",
    "we determine the threshold for the existence of solutions in random @xmath0-naesat up to an additive error that tends to zero exponentially with @xmath0 .",
    "this is the first time that the threshold in any random csp of this type can be calculated with such accuracy . while from a technical viewpoint @xmath0-naesat is perhaps the simplest example of a random csp that exhibits condensation , our proof technique rests on a rather generic approach",
    "therefore , we believe that with additional technical work our approach can be extended to many other problems , including random @xmath0-sat or random graph @xmath0-coloring .    to define random @xmath0-naesat formally , let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be integers and let @xmath5 be a set of boolean variables .",
    "for a fixed real @xmath6 we let @xmath7 .",
    "further , let @xmath8 be a propositional formula obtained by choosing @xmath9 clauses of length @xmath0 over @xmath10 uniformly and independently at random among all @xmath11 possible clauses .",
    "we say that an assignment @xmath12 is an _ nae - solution _ ( a `` solution '' ) if each clause has both a literal that evaluates to ` true ' under @xmath13 and one that evaluates to ` false ' .",
    "in other words , both @xmath13 and its inverse @xmath14 are satisfying assignments of the boolean formula @xmath15 .",
    "we say that an event occurs _ with high probability _ ( `` w.h.p . '' ) if its probability tends to one as @xmath16 .",
    "friedgut  @xcite proved that for any @xmath0 there exists a _ sharp threshold sequence _",
    "@xmath17 such that for any fixed @xmath18 w.h.p .",
    "@xmath15 has a nae - solution if @xmath19 , while w.h.p .",
    "@xmath15 fails to have one if @xmath20 .",
    "it is widely conjectured but as yet unproven that the threshold sequence converges for any @xmath3 .",
    "the best previous bounds on @xmath21 were derived by achlioptas and moore  @xcite and coja - oghlan and zdeborov  @xcite via the first / second moment method : @xmath22 where @xmath23 hides a term that tends to @xmath24 for large @xmath0 .",
    "this left an additive gap of @xmath25 , which our main result closes .",
    "[ thm_nae ] there is a sequence @xmath26 such that @xmath27    while the numerical improvement obtained in  theorem  [ thm_nae ] may seem modest , we are going to argue that the result is conceptually quite significant for two reasons .",
    "first , we obtain ( virtually ) matching upper and lower bounds for the first time in a random csp of this type .",
    "second , and perhaps even more importantly , we devise a rigorous method for taming the condensation phenomenon . indeed , condensation has been the main obstacle to determining the precise thresholds in random csps for the past decade . to understand why , we need to discuss the statistical mechanics picture and its relation to the second moment method .",
    "* _ the statistical mechanics perspective .",
    "_ * we follow  @xcite to sketch the non - rigorous statistical mechanics approach on random @xmath0-naesat . let @xmath28 denote the set of nae - solutions of @xmath15 , and let @xmath29 be the number of solutions .",
    "we turn @xmath30 into a graph by considering two solutions @xmath31 adjacent if their hamming distance is @xmath32 . according to  @xcite ,",
    "the ` shape ' of @xmath30 undergoes two substantial changes w.h.p.at certain densities @xmath33    the first transition occurs at @xmath34 , almost a factor of @xmath0 below @xmath21 .",
    "namely , for @xmath35 , @xmath30 is ( essentially ) a connected graph .",
    "but in the _ shattering phase _",
    "@xmath36 , @xmath30 splits into connected components @xmath37 called _ clusters _ that are mutually separated by a linear hamming distance @xmath38 .",
    "each cluster @xmath39 only comprises an exponentially small fraction of @xmath30 . in particular , the total number @xmath40 of clusters , the so - called _ complexity _ , is exponential in @xmath41 .",
    "this `` shattering '' of @xmath30 was indeed established rigorously in  @xcite .",
    "as the density @xmath42 increases beyond @xmath43 , both the overall number @xmath44 of solutions and the number and sizes of the clusters shrink",
    ". however , the cluster sizes decrease at a slower rate than @xmath44 , until at density @xmath45 the largest cluster has size @xmath46 w.h.p.in effect , in the _ condensation phase _ @xmath47 , the set @xmath30 still decomposes into an exponential number of clusters @xmath37 , each of tiny diameter and all mutually separated by hamming distance @xmath38 .",
    "but in contrast to the shattered phase , now the largest cluster contains a _ constant _ fraction of the entire set @xmath30 .",
    "indeed , w.h.p .",
    "a _ bounded _ number of clusters contain a @xmath48-fraction of all solutions .",
    "the dominance of a few large clusters in the condensation phase complicates the probabilistic nature of the problem dramatically . to see why , consider the experiment of first choosing a random formula @xmath15 , and then picking two solutions @xmath49 uniformly and independently . for @xmath36 , @xmath50 likely belong to different clusters , and hence can be expected to have a `` large '' hamming distance . in fact ,",
    "it is implicit in the previous work on the second moment method that @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , this means that the two random solutions `` decorrelate '' .",
    "by contrast , for @xmath47 both @xmath50 belong to the same large cluster with a non - vanishing probability . in effect , with a non - vanishing probability their distance @xmath52 is tiny , reflecting that solutions in the same cluster are heavily correlated .    the purpose of the physicists _ survey propagation _",
    "technique is precisely to deal with this type of correlation .",
    "the basic idea is to work with a different , non - uniform probability distribution on @xmath30 .",
    "this _ sp distribution _ is induced by first choosing a _ cluster _ @xmath39 uniformly at random among @xmath37 , and then selecting a solution in that cluster @xmath39 uniformly .",
    "since the number @xmath40 of clusters is ( thought to be ) exponential in @xmath41 throughout the condensation phase , two solutions @xmath53 chosen independently from the sp distribution are expected to lie in distinct clusters and thus to decorrelate w.h.p .",
    "starting from this ( appropriately formalized ) decorrelation assumption , the sp formalism prescribes a sequence of delicate ( non - rigorous ) steps to reduce the computation of the _ precise _ threshold @xmath21 to the solution of a continuous variational problem for any @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "this variational problem is itself highly non - trivial , but heuristic numerical techniques yield plausible approximations for small values of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "moreover , asymptotically for large @xmath0 the variational problem can be solved analytically .",
    "this led to the conjecture that @xmath54  @xcite , which theorem  [ thm_nae ] resolves .",
    "is theorem  [ thm_nae ] `` optimal '' ?",
    "of course , it would be interesting to prove that for any @xmath0 , the _ precise _ threshold @xmath21 equals the solution to the variational problem that the sp formalism spits out . however , given that this continuous problem itself appears difficult to solve analytically ( to say the very least ) , it seems that such a result would merely establish the equivalence of two hard mathematical problems .",
    "thus , we believe that theorem  [ thm_nae ] marks the end of the line as far as an analytic / explicit computation of @xmath21 is concerned .    * _ the first and the second moment method .",
    "_ * the above statistical mechanics picture holds the key to understanding why the previous arguments did not suffice to pin down @xmath21 precisely .",
    "the best previous bounds  ( [ eqprevious ] ) were obtained by applying the first / second moment method to the number @xmath44 of solutions , or a closely related random variable . with respect to the upper bound , if for some density @xmath42 the first moment @xmath55 tends to @xmath24 as @xmath41 gets large , then @xmath56 w.h.p .  by markov s inequality .",
    "thus , @xmath57 .",
    "indeed , it is not difficult to verify that @xmath58 for @xmath59  @xcite",
    ". this gives the upper bound in  ( [ eqprevious ] ) .",
    "the purpose of the second moment method is to bound @xmath21 from below .",
    "the general approach is this : suppose we can define a random variable @xmath60 such that @xmath61 only if @xmath15 has a nae - solution .",
    "moreover , assume that for some density @xmath42 , the second moment @xmath62 $ ] satisfies @xmath63\\leq c\\cdot{\\mathrm{e}}{\\left\\lbrack{y}\\right\\rbrack}^2\\ ] ] with @xmath64 dependent on @xmath0 but not on @xmath41 .",
    "then the _ paley - zygmund inequality _",
    "$ ] implies that @xmath66/{\\mathrm{e}}{\\left\\lbrack{y}\\right\\rbrack}^2\\geq1/c>0.\\ ] ] because the @xmath0-naesat threshold is sharp , and as @xmath67 is independent of @xmath41 , ( [ eqboundedaway ] ) implies that @xmath68 .",
    "the obvious choice of random variable is the number @xmath44 of solutions .",
    "since @xmath69 is just the number of _ pairs _ of nae - solutions , the second moment can be written as @xmath70=\\sum_{\\sigma,\\tau\\in{\\left\\{{0,1}\\right\\}}^n}{\\mathrm{p}}{\\left\\lbrack{\\mbox{both $ \\sigma,\\tau$ are nae - solutions}}\\right\\rbrack}.\\ ] ] indeed , achlioptas and moore  @xcite proved that  ( [ eqsmm ] ) is satisfied for @xmath71 if @xmath72 . improving upon  @xcite , coja - oghlan and zdeborov  @xcite obtained the best previous lower bound  ( [ eqprevious ] ) by considering a slightly modified random variable @xmath73 .",
    "namely , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is a certain event such that @xmath76 w.h.p.in other words , @xmath73 is equal to @xmath44 for almost all formulas , but a small fraction of `` bad '' formulas ( that would blow up the second moment ) are excluded .",
    "still , @xmath73 admits a similar decomposition as  ( [ eqdecompssecond ] ) ( one just has to condition on @xmath75 ) .",
    "as  ( [ eqdecompssecond ] ) shows , the second moment analysis of either @xmath44 or @xmath73 boils down to studying the correlations amongst _ pairs _ of solutions .",
    "in fact , it was observed in  @xcite that a _ necessary _ condition for the success of this approach is that two independently and uniformly chosen @xmath49 satisfy @xmath77 w.h.p.but according to the statistical mechanics picture , this decorrelation condition is violated for @xmath78 due to the presence of large clusters .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that the best previous lower bound  ( [ eqprevious ] ) on @xmath21 coincides with the ( conjectured ) condensation threshold @xmath79 .",
    "indeed , it was verified in  @xcite that a certain `` weak '' form of condensation sets in at @xmath80 .",
    "the statistical mechanics prescription to overcome these correlations is to work with the survey propagation distribution ( first select a cluster uniformly , then choose a random solution from that cluster ) rather than the uniform distribution over @xmath30 .",
    "this is precisely the key idea behind our new _ sp - inspired second moment argument_. roughly speaking , we are going to develop a way to apply the second moment method to the number @xmath40 of _ clusters _ , rather than the number of solutions .",
    "more precisely , we introduce a parameter @xmath81 that allows us to work with clusters of a prescribed size .",
    "a specific choice of @xmath81 ( namely , @xmath82 ) corresponds to the sp distribution and thus to working with @xmath83 .",
    "this new technique allows us to obtain various further results .",
    "for instance , we can pin down the typical values of both @xmath44 and @xmath40 throughout the condensation phase ( details omitted ) . furthermore , our proof entails the following result that confirms the physics conjecture that pairs of solutions drawn from the sp distribution decorrelate throughout the condensation phase .    [ cor_sp ] suppose that @xmath84 .",
    "let @xmath53 be drawn independently from the sp distribution",
    ". then @xmath85 w.h.p .",
    "* _ rigorous work . _ * the @xmath0-naesat problem is well - known to be np - complete in the worst case for any @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , the np - complete problem of @xmath86-coloring a @xmath0-uniform hypergraph ( with @xmath3 ) simply is the special case of @xmath0-naesat without negations .",
    "the results in  @xcite are actually phrased in terms of hypergraph @xmath86-coloring but carry over to @xmath0-naesat directly .",
    "the main contribution of theorem  [ thm_nae ] is the improved _ lower _ bound .",
    "in fact , the upper bound in  ( [ eqnew ] ) can be obtained in several different ways .",
    "achlioptas and moore  @xcite state without proof that the ( quite intricate ) enhanced first moment argument from  @xcite can be used to show that @xmath87 .",
    "this is indeed plausible as , in terms of the statistical mechanics intuition ( which was unknown to the authors of  @xcite ) this argument amounts to computing the first moment of the number of _",
    "clusters_. alternatively , generalizing work of franz and leone  @xcite , panchenko and talagrand  @xcite proved that the variational problem that results from the sp formalism yields a rigorous upper bound on @xmath21 , which is conjectured to be tight for any @xmath3 .",
    "the variational problem can be solved asymptotically in the large-@xmath0 limit ( unpublished ) , yielding the upper bound stated in theorem  [ thm_nae ] . in this paper",
    "we obtain the upper bound by a relatively simple third argument that has a neat combinatorial interpretation .",
    "the proofs of the lower bounds in  @xcite and in the present paper are non - constructive in the sense that they do not entail an efficient algorithm for finding a nae - solution w.h.p.the best current algorithm for random @xmath0-naesat is known to succeed for @xmath88 , a factor of @xmath89 below @xmath21  @xcite .    from a statistical mechanics point of view , many random csps are similar to random @xmath0-naesat . in particular , the physics methods suggest the existence of a condensation phase in most random csps ( e.g. , random @xmath0-sat / graph @xmath0-coloring ) . while  @xcite provided the prototype for the second moment arguments in these and other problems , the technical details in random graph @xmath0-coloring  @xcite or random @xmath0-sat  @xcite are quite a bit more intricate than in random @xmath0-naesat .",
    "for instance , random @xmath0-naesat is simpler than random @xmath0-sat because for any nae - solution @xmath13 the inverse @xmath90 is a nae - solution as well .",
    "this symmetry of the solution space under inversion simplifies the second moment calculations significantly . to cope with the absence of symmetry in random @xmath0-sat , achlioptas and peres  @xcite weighted satisfying assignments cleverly in order to recover the beneficial analytic properties that symmetry induces .",
    "our new second moment method is quite different from this weighting approach , since the asymmetry that called for the weighting scheme in  @xcite is absent in @xmath0-naesat .",
    "none of the ( few ) random csps in which the threshold for the existence of solutions is known precisely has a condensation phase .",
    "the most prominent example is random @xmath0-xorsat ( random linear equations mod @xmath86 )  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the algebraic nature of the problem precludes condensation : all clusters are simply translations of the kernel .",
    "similarly , the condensation phase is empty in the uniquely extendible problem from  @xcite .",
    "also in random @xmath0-sat with @xmath91 ( i.e. , the clause length grows as a function of @xmath41 ) , where the precise threshold has been determined by frieze and wormald  @xcite via the second moment method , condensation does not occur  @xcite . nor does it in random 2-sat  @xcite .",
    "parts of our proof require a precise analysis of geometry of the solution space @xmath30 .",
    "this analysis harnesses some of the ideas that were developed in previous work  @xcite ( e.g. , arguments for proving the existence of clusters or of `` rigid variables '' ) .",
    "however , we need to go beyond these previous arguments significantly in two respects .",
    "first , we need to generalize them to accommodate the parameter @xmath81 that controls the cluster sizes .",
    "second , we need rather precise quantitative information about the cluster structures . * _ survey propagation guided decimation . _",
    "* the sp formalism has given rise to an efficient message passing algorithm called _ survey propagation guided decimation _ ( ` spd ' )  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , spd seems spectacularly successful at solving , e.g. , random @xmath0-sat for small values of @xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately , no quantitative analysis of this algorithm is currently known ( not even a non - rigorous one ) . the basic idea behind spd is to approximate the marginals of the sp distribution ( i.e. , the probability that a given variable is ` true ' in a solution drawn from the sp distribution ) via a message passing heuristic . then a variable @xmath92 is selected according to some rule and is assigned a value based on the ( approximate ) marginal .",
    "the entire procedure is repeated on the `` decimated '' problem instance where @xmath92 has been eliminated , until ( hopefully ) a solution is found .",
    "the decorrelation of random solutions chosen from the sp distribution is a crucial assumption behind the message passing computation of the sp marginals .",
    "corollary  [ cor_sp ] establishes such a decorrelation property rigorously .",
    "however , in order to actually analyze spd , one would have to generalize corollary  [ cor_sp ] to the situation of a `` decimated '' random formula in which a number of variables have already been eliminated by previous steps of the algorithm .",
    "still , we believe that the techniques developed in this paper are a ( necessary ) first step towards a rigorous analysis of spd .",
    "_ in the rest of the paper we sketch the sp - inspired second moment method on which the proof of theorem  [ thm_nae ] is based . aiming for an asymptotic result",
    ", we may assume that @xmath93 for some ( large ) constant @xmath94 .",
    "we also assume @xmath95 for some @xmath96 .",

    "furthermore , let @xmath100 signify the @xmath101th literal of clause @xmath97 ; thus , @xmath102 . for a literal @xmath103 we let @xmath104 denote the underlying variable .",
    "_    as we discussed earlier , the demise of the `` standard '' second moment method in the condensation phase is due to the dominance of few large clusters .",
    "the statistical mechanics prescription for circumventing this issue is to work with a non - uniform distribution over solutions that favors `` small '' clusters . to implement this strategy",
    ", we are going to exhibit a simple parameter that governs the size of the cluster that a solution belongs to .",
    "formally , we define the _ cluster of @xmath105 _ as @xmath106 this definition is vindicated by the following observation from  @xcite , which shows that any two solutions either have the same cluster or are well - separated .",
    "[ prop_nomiddleground ] suppose that @xmath107 .",
    "any two @xmath108 either satisfy @xmath109 or @xmath110 .",
    "to proceed , we need to get an idea of the `` shape '' of the clusters @xmath111 . according to the sp formalism ,",
    "each cluster has a set @xmath112 of @xmath38 _ rigid variables _ on which _ all _ assignments in @xmath111 coincide , while the values of the non - rigid variables vary .",

    "@xmath119 with @xmath120 controlled by the number of rigid variables , it might seem promising to perform first / second moment arguments for the number of solutions with a suitably chosen number of rigid variables .",
    "the problem with this is that there is no simple way to tell whether a given variable is rigid : deciding this is np - hard in the worst case . intuitively , this is because rigidity emerges from the `` global '' interplay of variables and clauses . in effect ,",
    "parametrizing by the number of rigid variables appears technically infeasible .",
    "instead , we are going to work with a simple `` local '' parameter that turns out to be a good substitute .",
    "suppose that @xmath114 . then @xmath92 must occur in some clause @xmath97 that would be violated if @xmath92 was assigned the opposite value @xmath121 ( with all other variables unchanged ) . by the definition of @xmath0-naesat ,",
    "this means that the other @xmath122 literals of @xmath97 take the opposite value of the literal whose underlying variable @xmath92 is . in this case",

    "moreover , we call a variable that supports a clause _ blocked _ , while all other variables are _ free_. while every rigid variable is blocked , the converse is not generally true .",
    "nonetheless , we will see that the number of variables that are blocked but not rigid is small enough so that we can control the cluster sizes in terms of blocked variables .    as a first step",
