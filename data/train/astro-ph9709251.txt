    "in this paper we model the formation of high redshift galaxy clusters in order to investigate their effect on the cmb .",
    "together with the s - z effect , we will be concerned with another secondary anisotropy which was first discussed by rees & sciama ( 1968 ) .",
    "these authors pointed out that there is a gravitational effect on the cmb photons while they are crossing evolving cosmic structures such as a collapsing cluster of galaxies , since photons climb out of a slightly different potential well than the one into which they entered . in the next section",
    ", we present the observations carried out by jones et al .",
    "( 1997 ) which suggest the presence of a rich cluster of galaxies at a redshift @xmath0 .",
    "section [ model ] presents an improved model for the formation of spherical galaxy clusters .",
    "this model is applied to the pc1643 + 4631 observations and the results are summarised in section [ results ] .",
    "the work overviewed in this paper is discussed in more details in forthcoming papers ( lasenby et al .",
    "1997 & dabrowski et al .",
    "recent observations carried out with the ryle telescope at 15 ghz revealed an intriguing decrement in the cmb towards the pair of quasars pc1643 + 4631 a & b at red - shift @xmath1 and separated by 198 arc - seconds ( jones et al .",
    "fig.[fig : ryle ] shows the cmb decrement together with the quasar positions",
    ". if this decrement is due to a s - z effect , this is indicative of a rich intervening galaxy cluster of total mass @xmath2 . since the quasars spectra , as observed with the william herschel telescope ( wht ) , are virtually identical , saunders et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggest that such a massive cluster can account for the spectral similarities if we assume that the quasar pair is lensed .",
    "the remarkable aspect of the problem is that no x - ray cluster is visible in this direction .",
    "jones et al . ( 1997 ) argue that the absence of a detection with the x - ray roentgen satellite ( rosat ) indicates a redshift lower limit of @xmath0 for the expected cluster .",
    "saunders et al .",
    "( 1997 ) report colour imaging made with the wht ( r band ) and with the uk infrared telescope ( ukirt ) ( j and k bands ) .",
    "the absence of cluster in these observations raises the limit up to @xmath3 .",
    "recent deep observations ( work in progress ) have been made with the wht ( u , g , v , r and i bands ) .",
    "again , no visible clustering is observed , although there exist many objects in the field with expected redshift of @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the pc1643 + 4631 case is not isolated .",
    "indeed , a similar situation has also been reported from observations of the cmb with the very large array ( vla ) ( richards et al .",
    "the term `` dark cluster '' seems to have become increasingly popular for such objects ( e.g. hattori 1997 et al .",
    ", jimenez et al . 1997 , hawkins et al .",
    "early attempts to estimate the rees - sciama effect induced by a collapsing cluster of galaxies were based on the `` swiss cheese '' ( sc ) model ( e.g. rees & sciama 1968 , nottale 1982 & 1984 ) whereas more recent attempts have used the continuous tolman - bondi solution ( e.g. panek 1992 ) .",
    "we present here an improved model which , for the first time , treats such a problem exactly .",
    "we assume that the cluster is in a state of pure infall , at the centre of the reference frame .",
    "both the collapsing cluster and the expanding universe are treated as a unique pressure - less fluid , the evolution of which is determined by a set of analytical equations ( see lasenby et al .",
    "the fluid density and velocity field distributions are continuous and realistic ( see dabrowski et al . 1997 and fig.[fig : distribution ] ) which is a major improvement over the sc models .",
    "indeed for the sc case , an artificial vacuum region is needed to isolate the cluster from the universe which implies an unrealistic cluster density profile as well as discontinuities in the density and velocity field distributions .",
    "another advantage with regard to the sc models is that our perturbation is initially defined by only two free parameters rather than three in the sc case .",
    "initially , the density of our fluid is uniform and only the velocity field is perturbed in order to form a realistic cluster . in a given cosmology",
    "this perturbation is controlled by a size parameter and a rate of growth parameter .",
    "in addition to the evolution of the fluid we perform the exact calculation of photon trajectories and redshifts ( dabrowski et al .",
    "1997 ) so that effects such as rees - sciama or gravitational lensing can be fully appreciated .",
    "we now apply our model to the pc1643 + 4631 case in order to estimate the typical properties of clusters which may explain the observations of jones et al .",
    "our aim is to account for both the cmb decrement and the lensing of the quasar pair .",
    "we assume that the lensing effect will be correctly taken into account if the einstein ring radius is 100 arc - seconds . throughout this paper , we assume the following cosmology : @xmath5 , @xmath6 .    in order to obtain quantitative results",
    "we need to constrain our model parameters .",
    "we assume that the cluster lies at a redshift @xmath7 and that @xmath8 for both quasars a & b. we also consider a very rich cluster and fix the maximum baryonic number density experienced by an observed photon to @xmath9 and the total gravitational mass over baryonic mass ratio is taken to be 10 . in order to obtain an einstein ring radius of 100 arc - seconds we find that the core radius @xmath10 has to be @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath10 is defined as the radius at which the cluster energy falls to one - half its maximum value .",
    "we find that the total mass contained within a sphere of 2 mpc is @xmath12 and @xmath13 within a sphere of 4 mpc .",
    "the density and fluid velocity experienced by a photon passing through the centre of the cluster are shown in fig.[fig : distribution ] .",
    "we find that the density profile can be fitted accurately ( dabrowski et al .",
    "1997 ) by a standard king profile model known to represent realistically observed clusters ( rood et al .",
    "1972 & sarazin 1988 ) .",
    "+ we now investigate the effect of such a cluster on the cmb .",
    "firstly we compute the temperature @xmath14 required to produce a total s - z flux of @xmath15 on the ryle telescope .",
    "we find @xmath16 and that the corresponding s - z temperature decrement is @xmath17 .",
    "since our model allows photon path and redshift calculation we are able to estimate the rees - sciama effect and we find @xmath18 .",
    "we then conclude that the rees sciama effect is not negligible and might contribute significantly to the total observed cmb decrement .",
