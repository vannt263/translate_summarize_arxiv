    "the pion transition form factor ( tff ) between a photon and a pion is extracted from the @xmath4 process where the @xmath5 is produced via the two - photon production mechanism .",
    "this transition is represented as a function of the photon virtualities as @xmath6 .",
    "the tff is then extracted when one of the electrons is tagged .",
    "this electron emits a highly off - shell photon with momentum transfer @xmath7 and is detected while the other , untagged , is scattered at a small angle and then its momentum transfer @xmath8 is near zero .",
    "the pion transition form factor is then defined as @xmath9 .",
    "the tff was measured in the cello  @xcite and cleo  @xcite experiments in the momentum transfer ranges @xmath10 gev@xmath11 and @xmath12 gev@xmath11 , respectively . at 2009 ,",
    "the babar collaboration extended these measurements in the @xmath13 range from @xmath14 to @xmath15 gev@xmath11  @xcite . and",
    "recently  @xcite , the belle collaboration has measured the form factor in the same babar s energy region with slightly different results on the high - energy region .    at",
    "low transferred momentum , the tff can be described by the expansion : @xmath16 where the parameter @xmath17 can be determined from the axial anomaly  @xcite in the chiral limit of qcd , @xmath18 with @xmath19 the pion decay constant .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 , the slope of the tff , was measured by  @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , with the results @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 respectively ( the first error is statistic and the second systematic ) . the cello collaboration estimated @xmath1 to be @xmath23 in ref .",
    "@xcite using an extrapolation from the region of large space - like momentum transfer assuming a vector meson dominance ( vmd ) and using at zero transferred momentum the current experimental value for the partial decay width @xmath24 ( which as we will see later is related to @xmath25 , the axial anomaly ) .",
    "the ktev collaboration also predicted @xmath26 through a model - dependent fit to time - like data  @xcite .",
    "the cello prediction however dominates the number quoted by the pdg @xcite since the direct measurements are less precise .",
    "a vmd fit to all the available data ( cello , cleo , babar and belle ) would yield @xmath27 with a @xmath28 ( @xmath29 meaning `` degrees of freedom '' ) , which means a 1.4 standard deviations from the cello result .",
    "this result suggests that the high - energy data may be important for determining low energy properties of the tff .",
    "one immediately comes to the question on how to improve on the quality of the fits to stabilize the predicted result and also on how to assign a systematic error to the fit procedure .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was suggested that the vmd is a first step on a sequence of particular rational approximations called pad approximants ( pa ) . in that reference",
    "was also suggested that using pad approximants as a fitting functions to analyze the pion vector form factor in the space - like region , one can go beyond the vmd in a systematic approximation .    in the tff case ,",
    "this fact is of particular interest since the data from the babar collaboration can not be easily accommodated in the vmd picture . with the help of these rational approximants , one could reach systematically the intermediate and high - energy experimental data producing , at the same time , an accurate results for the slope and curvature of the tff at low - energies .",
    "the pad technics provides with a simple , model - independent and systematic method of fitting data with a larger range of convergence than the simple polynomial fit or a vmd - like fit ( such as the one used by cello collaboration to extract the @xmath1 parameter ) . given a function @xmath30 defined in the complex plane ,",
    "the pa @xmath31 are ratios of two polynomials @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( with degree @xmath34 and @xmath35 resp . )",
    "the coefficients of those exactly coincides with the coefficients of the taylor expansion of @xmath30 up to the highest order , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "the pa method also provides with an estimation of a systematic error and could be also used to evaluate the impact of the vector excitations in the process considered .",
    "the technics described here were applied also on the search of resonance poles in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are several types of pa but as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite the analytic properties of the function to be approximated determines what pa should be used .",
    "the time - like region is largely dominated by the @xmath37meson contribution .",
    "the natural choice seems to be a @xmath38 . on the other hand , since it is well known @xcite that the tff behaves like @xmath39 at very large energies one could try to incorporate this information by considering a @xmath40 .    for explanatory reasons we show here how to constract a @xmath38 approximant [ a @xmath40 is more involved and less illustrative ] .",
    "given a function @xmath30 defined in the complex plane , a pad approximant @xmath41 is defined  @xcite , without any loss of generality , by @xmath42 where the coefficients @xmath43 are the taylor coefficients of the corresponding @xmath30 function that is been approximated .",
    "( [ paeq ] ) shows that the pole @xmath44 of each @xmath41 is determined by the ratio @xmath45 .",
    "the tff seems to be well described by the simple vmd ansatz .",
    "vmd relies on the accurate knowledge of the light meson spectra .",
    "when the spectral information is given in advance one should also take advantage of that information and consider other kinds of rational approximants .",
    "these are the pad - type approximants . in the pad - type approximants ( ptas )",
    "the poles of the pad are fixed to certain values ( in our case , the resonances of the spectrum ) .",
    "the simplest pta sequence incorporates the lowest resonance , the @xmath46 , and it is called @xmath47 . the famous vmd ansatz is nothing but the simplest pta , the @xmath48 approximant .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold : first we want to extract the slope and the curvature of the transition form factor using a sequence of @xmath41 approximants as fitting functions to the available experimental data .",
    "we demand an assignment of a systematic error to our predictions .",
    "second we estimate the impact of our results on the light - by - light ( lbl ) contribution to the hadronic process on the muon @xmath49 .",
    "we also comment in passing on the recent proposal to measure the transition form factor at low energy using the besiii experiment .",
    "we proceed as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we study the reliability of the pa method as fitting functions to proceed then on section [ sec : fitreal ] to analyze the real data . in section [ sec : g2 ] we consider the impact of the previous result on the lbyl contribution to the muon @xmath49 .",
    "we finally collect all the results on the conclusions section .",
    "before applying the method to the experimental data to extract the slope and the curvature of the tff , we want to test its reliability with a particular model . since it has not been possible to describe rigourously the tff from basic principals , several models have been developed during the last years with the purpose of analyzing the space - like data to extract fundamental qcd properties . in these refs .",
    "@xcite we try to summarize the large effort done on this purpose .    considering this variety of models we examine instead of just one , three of them that we think are representative of the large amount of work done on this respect .",
    "since our intent is to show the properties of our method , the selected models should describe well the experimental data but keep the complexity at a manageable level .",
    "this exercise will also provide a way to estimate the systematic error of our approximations .",
    "the first model considered is motivated by a quark model ( e.g. , @xcite , see also  @xcite for other @xmath50 related models ) , although it can also be inspired by the lowest order perturbative qcd(pqcd ) with a flat pion distribution amplitude ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) or even by the babar fitting function  @xcite .",
    "we named the model `` log - model '' : @xmath51 with @xmath52gev@xmath11 and @xmath53mev .              finally , as a third model",
    "be analyze a simple holographic confining model presented in  @xcite ( and also explored in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , based on light - front holographic qcd where the correct small @xmath13 behavior ( in order to simulate confinement ) is introduced using the dressed current ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "this model reproduces quite well the transition form factor data up to @xmath63gev@xmath11 but disagrees in particular with babar s large @xmath13 data ( although compatible with belle data within errors ) , specially because the model is reaching its asymptotic prediction ( @xmath64  @xcite ) already at this medium-@xmath13 region .",
    "another interesting feature of this model is that no convergence theorem from pad theory is known for this kind of function and then the pad convergence is not guaranteed in advance ( in contrast to the previous regge - model ) .",
    "it represents a robustness test of our method .    after generating again a set of zero - error data points with the model of eq .",
    "( [ lfmodel ] ) , we use the pa sequence to fit these data and to obtain again the predictions for the @xmath56 coefficients .",
    "we collect the results in table  [ tablelf ] .",
    "+ with the pa @xmath65 we obtain @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 as a relative errors for @xmath17 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively . with the inclusion of the feasibility study at bes - iii @xcite",
    ", we go down to @xmath71 , and @xmath72 for @xmath73 resp . with the pta sequence ( the approximant pole located at @xmath74gev@xmath11 ) we obtain @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , respectively . although no convergence theorem for this kind of function in eq .",
    "( [ lfmodel ] ) is known , the convergence of our pa sequence is clear .",
    "that is one of the most interesting features of the pa methods which is the convergence may occurs beyond expectations .",
