    "we report the measurement of the momentum spectra of charged and neutral @xmath1 and  charm mesons produced at the cornell electron - positron storage ring , cesr , in non - resonant  annihilation at about 10.5  gev center of mass energy ( cme ) and observed with the cleo detector . the  and  spectra each include both directly produced @xmath1 s , and @xmath1 s which are decay products of @xmath1 excited states . from them",
    "we also derive the inclusive production cross section for these charm mesons .",
    "while very accurate data on bottom quark production from lep and sld have been published in recent years  @xcite , the data currently available for studies of charm fragmentation at 10.5  gev cme  @xcite , are quite old and , by present standards , of poor statistical quality and momentum resolution .",
    "our statistical sample is about 80 times larger than the our previous one  @xcite and our current momentum resolution is about a factor of 2 better .",
    "the spectra represent measurements of charm quark fragmentation distributions @xmath2 , , the probability density that a @xmath3 quark produces a charm hadron @xmath4 carrying a fraction @xmath5 of its momentum , @xmath6 being the `` energy scale '' of the process , the cme in our case  @xcite .",
    "experimental heavy - meson spectra in  collisions are important for theoretical and practical reasons : ( i ) they provide a component that is not yet calculable in predicting heavy flavor production in very high energy hadronic collisions , ( ii ) they can test advanced perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) methods , ( iii ) they can test the qcd evolution equations , and ( iv ) they provide information for best parametrization of the monte carlo simulations on which the analysis of many high energy experiments partially rely .    items ( i ) and ( ii ) are interconnected .",
    "the calculations of heavy flavor production cross sections in hadronic collisions ( , at the tevatron and the lhc ) are generally based on the factorization hypothesis , , a convolution of ( a ) the parton distribution function for the colliding hadrons , ( b ) the perturbative calculation of the parton - parton cross section and ( c ) the parton fragmentation function @xmath7 .",
    "items ( b ) and part of ( c ) ( the parton - shower cascade ) can be calculated , in the case of heavy quarks , using pqcd .",
    "items ( a ) and the second phase of ( c ) ( the hadronization phase ) are intrinsically non - perturbative ( long distance ) processes : as of now , they must be provided by experiments .",
    "there is an ongoing theoretical effort to push the potential of pqcd to calculate the perturbative component of the fragmentation function .",
    "it needs tests and guidance from the experimental spectra of heavy flavored hadrons produced in  annihilation . de - convolving the calculated pqcd component from the experimental spectra , one obtains the non - perturbative component of the fragmentation function .",
    "unphysical behavior of the result ( _ e.g. _ , negative values , extension beyond the kinematic limit ) is indication that further refinement of the pqcd calculation is needed .",

    ", the amount of  background is constrained to a fixed fraction ( 0.357 ) of the  background , based on the known relative branching ratio  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath62 contribution is very small , and alternative methods of accounting for it cause negligible changes in signal yields .",
    "[ fig : dz11 ] shows data in three representative momentum intervals , demonstrating how the background is built up from the four contributions .",
    "all four background components are needed to extract the yield .      in the case of the @xmath16 decay , direct or from  decay , in addition to using a double gaussian as fitting function for the signal , we use a different procedure that leads to results that are statistically competitive . in the @xmath16 case ,",
    "the signal is quite narrow and the background is smooth over a wide  region .",
    "we exclude the signal region and fit the background to a polynomial .",
    "the signal region is centered on the mean of the double gaussian fit and its range is chosen so as to contain the entire signal .",

    "we perform this procedure on data for three choices of the signal region : 1.810 - 1.920  gev , 1.820 - 1.910  gev and 1.830 - 1.900  gev .",

    "based on these results , we choose the data spectrum obtained with the 1.820 - 1.910  gev exclusion as our result .",
    "the bin - by - bin rms spread of the three data spectra obtained with different signal region exclusions is taken as the estimate of the systematic error of this procedure .",
    "we have two valid measurements , one from the count method and the other from double gaussian fitting of the signal , both performed on the same statistical sample .",
    "hence we take as result the bin - by - bin arithmetic average of the spectrum obtained by double gaussian fitting and the one obtained by the count method with the optimal choice of the signal region exclusion : @xmath63  gev .",
    "the shape parameters of the signal and background functions are expected to depend smoothly on @xmath53 . by imposing this smoothness of the shape parameters we suppress , in part , the bin - to - bin ( in ) statistical fluctuations in the spectra .",

    "this parameter smoothing procedure was used also in our measurement of charm meson momentum spectra from @xmath8 decay  @xcite . in the last paragraph of this subsection",
    "we show the extent of improvement obtained .",
    "the parameters considered are : the mean of the double gaussian ( common to the two gaussians ) , the width of the narrower gaussian , @xmath64 , the ratio of the widths of the wider to the narrower gaussian , @xmath65 , and the ratio of the area of the wider gaussian to the total area , @xmath66 .",
    "we impose this smooth behavior by fitting the  dependence of each shape parameter to a polynomial , at most quadratic , in .",
