    "this simple model yields power - law tailed distributions of inter - events times , mimicking the empirical histograms of many human activities .    besides the value of queuing models for diverse practical questions , another issue that makes bqm attractive is its connection with diverse other physical problems such as invasion percolation  @xcite or self - organized evolutionary models  @xcite , as soon as the roles of priorities and fitness can be identified",
    "however , exact results for the bqm , both for steady  @xcite and transient  @xcite regimes , have been obtained for the simplest instance @xmath3 only .",
    "although lists of two items already display the power - law decay of the distribution of waiting times when @xmath1 approaches unity , naturally , other features are missed in the simplest case . moreover ,",
    "special attention has been given to the particular , and more tractable case , of extremal dynamics when @xmath4  @xcite , while non - null degree of randomness @xmath5 may also display interesting features .",
