    "a spin valve consists of a thin non - magnetic metallic layer ( nm ) sandwiched by two ferromagnetic layers ( fm ) with variable magnetization direction .",
    "one of the fm layers is usually thick and its magnetization is fixed , while the other is thin and its magnetization direction is free to move .",
    "spin valves have a wide range of interesting static and dynamic properties , @xcite many of which are related to the current - induced spin - transfer torque , @xcite which can excite magnetization dynamics ( and reversal ) .",
    "inversely , magnetization dynamics generates a current flow or a voltage output .",
    "berger first discussed the induced voltage in an fm|nm|fm structure by magnetization dynamics .",
    "@xcite he posited that a voltage of order @xmath0 can be generated when the magnetization of one ferromagnet precesses at frequency @xmath1 .",
    "similar dynamically induced voltages have been studied theoretically @xcite and observed @xcite in simple fm|nm junctions and in magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs ) .",
    "@xcite in spin valves and mtjs , voltage induced by the magnetization dynamics can be understood as a two - step process : i ) the moving magnetization of the free layer generates a spin current ; ii ) the static magnetization of the fixed layer filters the `` pumped '' spin current and converts it into a charge current or , in an open circuit , a voltage output .",
    "the electrical voltage induced by moving domain walls can be explained analogously .",
    "@xcite in the first part of the present paper , we derive a simple formula for the charge pumping voltage in a spin valve by circuit theory in which magnetization dynamics is taken into account .",
    "we find that the magnitude of the voltage is governed by the spin - transfer torque in the same structure .",
    "we therefore propose to measure the angular dependence of the spin - transfer torque ( or torkance , _",
    "i.e. _ the torque divided by the voltage bias ) by the angular dependence of the charge pumping voltage .",
    "the charge pumping voltage consists of a dc and an ac component , even when induced by a steady magnetization dynamics such as ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) .",
    "the concept can be extended to the case of thermally activated , _",
    "i.e. _ fluctuating , magnetization dynamics , which is an extra source of thermal voltage noise that only appears in magnetic structures .",
    "johnson @xcite and nyquist @xcite showed that in non - magnetic conductors the voltage noise is associated with thermal agitation of charge carriers ( driven by fluctuating electromagnetic modes ) .",
    "the power spectrum of this noise is white and proportional to the temperature @xmath2 and resistance @xmath3 : @xmath4 up to frequencies of @xmath5 ghz at room temperature .",
    "@xcite in magnetic structures such as spin valves thermal fluctuations of the magnetization direction have to be considered .",

    "frequencies are studied by means of resistance fluctuations without applied magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite foros _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that the time - averaged auto - correlator of the resistance fluctuations is significantly affected by dynamical exchange coupling between the magnetic layers .    in the second part of this paper , we show that a magnetization fluctuation - related voltage noise can be of the same order of magnitude as the conventional thermal noise in non - magnetic conductors . this noise is not `` white '' but displays spectral features related to the ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) .",
    "the noise spectrum therefore contains information comparable to that obtained by fmr . for nano - scale ferromagnetic circuits",
    "the noise measurements might be easier to perform than conventional fmr experiments . compared to the resistance noise measurement ,",
    "the pumping voltage noise measurement is non - intrusive because it does not require application of current , which may disturb the system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii presents a general theoretical frame work that combines the magnetoelectric circuit theory and the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation . in section iii ,",
    "we derive a formula for the charge pumping voltage in spin valves . in section iv , by using the magnetic susceptibility function , we calculate the voltage noise spectrum due to magnetization fluctuations for two different magnetic configurations . section v contains some general remarks on the calculation . in appendix",
    "a we calculate the angular - dependence of the magnetic susceptibility for a spin valve , and appendix b presents an alternative calculation of the magnetization - related thermal noise by computing the frequency dependent impedance of a spin valve .",
    "\\(a ) shows a spin valve structure under consideration .",
    "the magnetization in the left fm with direction @xmath6 is assumed to be static and @xmath7 , the one of the right fm , to be free , which can be realized by making the right layer much thinner than the left one . for electron transport",
    ", we assume for simplicity that the spin valve is symmetric . such an assumption may be invoked when both fm layers are of the same material and thicker than the spin flip diffusion length . in that regime ,",
    "the resistances of the bulk ferromagnet over the spin - flip diffusion length are in series with the interface resistances , whereas the remoter parts of the ferromagnets are magnetically inert series resistances .",
    "the regime in which the layers become thinner than the spin flip diffusion length has been treated by kovalev _ et .",
    "@xcite in this and the next section , we focus on the spin - active region in the spin valve , which includes the nm spacer and small part ( of the order of the spin - flip diffusion length ) of the fm layers as indicated by the dashed box in ( a ) .     and [ sec : cpc ] .",

    "@xcite when the adjacent normal metal is an ideal spin sink , the spin pumping current loss can be represented by a gilbert damping coefficient ( see below ) , and each interface contributes to the damping constant by @xmath12 , introducing the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath13 and the total magnetization of the right fm film @xmath14 .",
    "the imaginary part @xmath10 effectively modifies the gyromagnetic ratio for the magnetization under consideration .    in order to use magnetoelectronic circuit theory ,",

    "@xcite similarly for the right fm lead :    [ eqn : ctr ] @xmath24    where the spin current @xmath25 at the right interface is modified due to the additional spin pumping current @xmath11 emitted by the moving magnetization @xmath7 .",

    "can be solved separately by ignoring the spin pumping contribution @xmath11 in @xmath25 , in which case the transport only depends on the instantaneous @xmath7 but not on @xmath33 . however , for thin magnetic layers the spin pumping modification can not be neglected .",
    "it has possibly important consequences , such as a voltage induced by magnetization dynamics , anisotropic magnetic damping and susceptibility tensor , and colored thermal noise , as will become clear from the discussion below .    at first ,",

    "<S> the effect depends on the magnetization configuration and can be of the same order of magnitude as the johnson - nyquist thermal noise . </S>",
    "<S> measuring colored voltage noise is an alternative to ferromagnetic resonance experiments for nano - scale ferromagnetic circuits . </S>"
