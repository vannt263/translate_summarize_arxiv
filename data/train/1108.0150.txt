    "the long - range interactions between a charged particle and an atom is usually described by a polarization potential .",
    "this interaction is constructed by making a multipole expansion of the two - particle coulomb interaction leading to the following long - range expression for the second - order adiabatic polarization potential , @xmath0 in this expression , the @xmath1 are the static multipole polarizabilities .",
    "the most important term arising from @xmath2 , the static dipole polarizability is sometimes called the polarizability . equation ( [ vpol1 ] )",
    "has been long known to be an asymptotic expansion .",
    "the polarization potential given by eq .",
    "( [ vpol1 ] ) eventually diverges as @xmath3 increases at any finite value of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "formal issues of a similar nature also lead to a problem in the multipole expansion of the atom - atom dispersion interaction .",
    "dalgarno and lewis @xcite originally showed the multipole expansion of the h - h second - order dispersion interaction , @xmath5 also diverges in the unsold mean energy approximation @xcite , as @xmath6 at any finite @xmath4 .",
    "sometime later it was shown that the exact multipole series for the h - h interaction was also asymptotic @xcite .",
    "recently , b - spline basis sets have become very popular for solving atomic structure and collisions problems @xcite .",
    "such methods often impose the boundary condition that the wave function is zero at some finite radial distance , i.e. effectively solving the schrodinger equation in a sphere of finite volume .",
    "one aspect of bounding the wave function is that the reaction of the wave function to an electric field also becomes bounded in space .",
    "this results in a multipole expansion of the polarization interaction that can be shown to be absolutely convergent provided that the distance from the atom is larger than the confining radius of the atom .",
    "the imposition of a @xmath7 boundary will result in a multipole expansion that is mathematically well behaved at the cost tolerating a small error in the size magnitude of the polarization potential .    in this manuscript",
    "the unsold approximation is applied to estimate the multipole polarizabilities of a confined h atom .",
    "the resulting polarization expansion is then shown to be absolutely convergent when the radius is larger than the boundary of the confinement potential .",
    "this is supplemented by finite radius b - spline calculations of the hydrogen polarizabilities for a box size of @xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "the results of these explicit calculations confirm the unsold analysis and it is shown that the error in the polarization potential arising from the use of finite radius polarizabilities does not exceed 3 part in @xmath10 .",
    "the static multipole polarizabilities of any spherically symmetric state are defined @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the excitation energy from state @xmath13 to state @xmath14 , the sum implicitly includes the continuum , and @xmath15 is the oscillator strength of multipole @xmath3 connecting the state 0 to the excited state @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath15 are defined @xcite @xmath16 in this expression @xmath17 is the spherical tensor of rank @xmath3 .    consider the oscillator strength sum rule @xmath18 this satisfies the identity @xmath19 @xcite where @xmath20 is the number of electrons and @xmath21 is a radial expectation value of the ground state wave function .",
    "this expression reduces to the well known thomas - reiche - kuhn sum rule @xmath22 for @xmath2 . for the hydrogen atom ground state ,",
    "the sum rule is @xmath23 the exact value of the multipole polarizabilities for the hydrogen atom ground state can be written @xcite @xmath24    for a confined atom , the radial expectation value in eq .",
    "( [ fsuml ] ) will be bounded by the radius of the @xmath25-spline box , @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath27 note that the correctness of eq .",
    "( [ fsuml ] ) for calculations in a finite box has been validated to 20 significant figures .",
    "( [ radial ] ) shows the factorial growth in the sum - rule , eq .",
    "( [ fsumh ] ) is eliminated once the wave function is confined . for the hydrogen atom ground state one",
    "has @xmath28    confining a hydrogen atom also impacts the energies of the states .",
    "so the energies used to calculate the oscillator strengths and the energies used in the energy denominators of eq .",
    "( [ alphal ] ) . as @xmath3 increases in size",
    ", the centrifugal potential will tend to dominate the coulomb potential for @xmath29 .",
    "for @xmath30 the total potential is repulsive and increases monotonically for decreasing @xmath4 .",
    "when this occurs , the minimum excitation energy will be larger than the potential at @xmath31 , i.e @xmath32 .",
    "for sufficiently large @xmath3 one can write @xmath33 .    making the unsold mean energy approximation @xcite , and setting the mean excitation energy to the minimum value , leads to the following large @xmath3 approximate expression for the hydrogen polarizabilities @xmath34 the ratio of two successive terms in eq .",
    "( [ vpol1 ] ) , @xmath35 this ratio is less than one for @xmath36 less than 1 .",
    "therefore the polarization series is absolutely convergent as long as @xmath4 is greater than @xmath26 .",
    "this absolute convergence has been substantiated by calculations of the multipole polarizabilities of the hydrogen ground state .",
    "calculations were performed using a b - spline basis with the outer boundary set to @xmath37 @xmath9 and results are reported in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the static polarizabilities of hydrogen have been previous calculated using b - splines basis sets @xcite but the intent of the present work is different from the earlier investigations .    the radial wave function is written as b - splines @xmath38 where @xmath39 is normalized such that @xmath40 the boundary conditions are such that the first b - spline is finite at the origin .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ , < , < , < , < \" , ]     the polarizabilities listed in table [ tab1 ] show the increasing difference between the the b - spline calculation of @xmath1 from the exact calculation at the higher values of @xmath3 .",
    "the polarizabilities are written as @xmath41 where @xmath26 specifies the outer radius of the b - spline box .",
    "the b - spline @xmath41 increases less rapidly than the exact value , @xmath42 , and at @xmath43 is 1000 times smaller than the exact polarizability .    the convergence of the @xmath25-spine polarization potential at @xmath44 @xmath9 is also shown in figure [ fig1 ] . the contributions of each individual multipole in eq .",
    "( [ vpol1 ] ) , i.e. @xmath45 , are plotted as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "the divergence in the polarization series is apparent as the increments start to increase for @xmath46 .",
    "however , the increments steadily decrease as @xmath3 increases for the multipole expansion for the b - spline @xmath47 providing a computational demonstration of the absolute convergence of the b - spline expansion .",
    "the imposition of the boundary at @xmath37 @xmath9 has resulted in a polarization potential that is 0.0003@xmath48 smaller in magnitude at @xmath44 @xmath9 than the expansion using the exact polarizabilities .",
    "most of this difference arises from the dipole and quadrupole terms in the multipole expansion .",
    "the demonstrated convergence of the b - spline expansion has some relevance to the earlier analysis by brooks @xcite .",
    "he stated that the origin of the multipole series divergence was the use of the expansion @xmath49 beyond its region of validity .",
    "this analysis recommended that all radial matrix elements involved in the evaluation of the polarizability have their radial integrations limited to a finite value , e.g. @xmath50 , which would a lower bound on the region for which one writes the polarization potential using eq .",
    "( [ vpol1 ] ) .",
    "the interaction , eq .",
    "( [ r12 ] ) is effectively reduced to @xmath51 where @xmath50 is a lower bound to the radial coordinate used to evaluate @xmath52 .",
    "the resulting multipole expansion was then shown to be convergent .",
    "brookes concluded that the divergence in the polarization expansion was caused by using eq .",
    "( [ r12 ] ) in regions of space where it is not correct .",
    "this statement is correct , but can not be used to imply that the evaluation of the second - order polarization interaction using @xmath53 without making the multipole expansion will lead to a convergent expansion in powers of @xmath54 .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that by an exact analysis in the unsold approximation that the power series expansion @xmath54 of the hydrogen atom polarization potential is asymptotic @xcite . however , using a wave function that is limited in radial extent , or using an interaction that is limited in radial extent @xcite will lead to a convergent expansion of the polarization interaction .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the multipole expansion of a confined hydrogen atom polarization potential leads to an inverse power series that is absolutely convergent provided the distance from the nucleus is larger than the box radius .",
    "while the result is rigorous for hydrogen , one can reasonably assert that the result can be applied to any atom .",
    "this result has implications that go beyond the second - order perturbation expansion of the polarization interaction .",
    "for example , the stark effect is known to be divergent with respect to order of perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to speculate whether bounding the wave function will also remove this divergence .    the multipole expansion of the atom - atom dispersion interaction is also known to be asymptotic in nature @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to speculate that this expansion would also be absolutely convergent for two confined atoms provided the internuclear distance was larger than the sum of the two box sizes .",
    "it is interesting to note that jansen @xcite had suggested that the @xmath55 multipole expansion would converge provided the basis set used in the evaluation of the oscillator strength sum rule was restricted in dimension and range @xcite .",
    "the numerical results associated with the work of jansen were rather restricted in scope .",
    "koide had devised a momentum space treatment that resulted in each dispersion parameter being multiplied by a radial cutoff of factor @xcite .",
    "although it could be shown that the resulting dispersion interaction was convergent at any finite @xmath4 as @xmath6 the method has only ever been applied to a few terms of the h - h dispersion interaction .",
    "one aspect of the present analysis should be emphasised .",
    "confining the atomic wave function to a finite region of space does constitute the imposition of an artificial constraint upon the wave function .",
    "however , such constraints are routinely applied in calculations of atomic structure based on b - spline basis sets .",
    "these descriptions of atomic structure will automatically have no formal issues with respect to the convergence of the multipole expansion of the polarization interaction .",
