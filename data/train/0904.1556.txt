    "the standard model of particle physics is one of the greatest triumphs of physics .",
    "this theory is our best attempt to describe all the particles and all the forces of nature ... _ except _ gravity .",
    "it does a great job of fitting experiments we can do in the lab . but physicists are dissatisfied with it .",
    "there are three main reasons .",
    "first , it leaves out gravity : that force is described by einstein s theory of general relativity , which has not yet been reconciled with the standard model .",
    "second , astronomical observations suggest that there may be forms of matter not covered by the standard model  most notably , ` dark matter ' . and",
    "third , the standard model is complicated and seemingly arbitrary .",
    "this goes against the cherished notion that the laws of nature , when deeply understood , are simple and beautiful .    for the modern theoretical physicist , looking beyond the standard model",
    "has been an endeavor both exciting and frustrating .",
    "most modern attempts are based on string theory .",
    "there are also other interesting approaches , such as loop quantum gravity and theories based on noncommutative geometry .",
    "but back in the mid 1970 s , before any of the currently popular approaches rose to prominence , physicists pursued a program called ` grand unification ' .",
    "this sought to unify the forces and particles of the standard model using the mathematics of lie groups , lie algebras , and their representations .",
    "ideas from this era remain influential , because grand unification is still one of the most fascinating attempts to find order and beauty lurking within the standard model .",
    "this paper is a gentle introduction to the group representations that describe particles in the standard model and the most famous grand unified theories . to make the material more approachable for mathematicians , we limit our scope by not discussing particle interactions or ` symmetry breaking'the way a theory with a large symmetry group can mimic one with a smaller group at low energies .",
    "these topics lie at the very heart of particle physics .",
    "but by omitting them , we can focus on ideas from algebra that many mathematicians will find familiar , while introducing the unfamiliar ways that physicists use these ideas .",
    "in fact , the essential simplicity of the representation theory involved in the standard model and grand unified theories is quite striking . the usual textbook approach to particle physics proceeds through quantum field theory and gauge theory .",
    "while these subjects are very important to modern mathematics , learning them is a major undertaking .",
    "we have chosen to focus on the algebra of grand unified theories because many mathematicians have the prerequisites to understand it with only a little work .",
    "a full - fledged treatment of particle physics requires quantum field theory , which uses representations of a noncompact lie group called the poincar group on _ infinite - dimensional _",
    "hilbert spaces .",
    "this brings in a lot of analytical subtleties , which make it hard to formulate theories of particle physics in a mathematically rigorous way .",
    "in fact , no one has yet succeeded in doing this for the standard model .",
    "but by neglecting the all - important topic of particle interactions , we can restrict attention to _ finite - dimensional _",
    "hilbert spaces : that is , finite - dimensional complex inner product spaces .",
    "this makes our discussion purely algebraic in flavor .",
    "every theory we consider has an ` internal symmetry group ' or ` gauge group ' .",
    "this is a compact lie group , say @xmath4 .",
    "particles then live in representations of @xmath4 on a finite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath5 . more precisely : @xmath5 can always be decomposed as a direct sum of irreducible representations , or * irreps*and for our limited purposes , _ particles are basis vectors of irreps_. this provides a way to organize particles , which physicists have been exploiting since the 1960s .",
    "the idea of ` unification ' has a clear meaning in these terms .",
    "suppose @xmath5 is a representation , not only of @xmath4 , but also some larger group @xmath6 having @xmath4 as a subgroup .",
    "then we expect @xmath5 to decompose into fewer irreps as a representation of @xmath6 than as a representation of @xmath4 , because elements of @xmath6 can mix different irreps of @xmath4 .",
    "so : by introducing a larger symmetry group , particles can be unified into larger irreps .    `",
    "grand unification ' occurs when the compact lie group @xmath4 is simple , and thus not a product of other groups . a gauge theory based on @xmath4 requires an invariant inner product on its lie algebra .",
    "when @xmath4 is simple , this form is unique up to a scale factor , which physicists call a ` coupling constant ' : this measures the strength of the force corresponding to @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath4 is the product of simple factors , there is one coupling constant for each factor of @xmath4 .",
    "so , by using a simple lie group as gauge group , we minimize the number of coupling constants .    in this paper",
    ", we give an account of the algebra behind the standard model and three attempts at unification : georgi and glashow s @xmath1 theory , georgi s theory based on the group @xmath2 ( physicists call this the @xmath7 theory ) , and the pati  salam model . all three date to around 1974 .",
    "the first two are known as grand unified theories , or guts , because they are based on simple lie groups .",
    "salam model is different : while it is called a gut by some authors , and does indeed involve unification , it is based on the lie group @xmath3 , which is merely semisimple .",
    "it is important to note that these theories have their problems .",
    "the @xmath1 theory predicts that protons will decay more quickly than they do , and it requires certain trends to hold among the relative strengths of forces at high energies  trends which the data do not support .",
    "the @xmath7 theory may still be viable , especially if at low enough energies it reduces to the pati  salam model .",
    "however , the issues involved are complex . for details , see the paper by bertolini _",
    "et al _ and the many references therein @xcite .    nonetheless , it is still very much worthwhile for mathematicians to study the algebra of grand unified theories .",
    "first , even apart from their physical significance , these theories are intrinsically beautiful mathematical structures .",
    "second , they provide a nice way for mathematicians to get some sense of the jigsaw puzzle that physicists are struggling to solve .",
    "it is certainly hopeless trying to understand what physicists are trying to accomplish with string theory without taking a look at grand unified theories .",
    "finally , grand unified theories can be generalized by adding ` supersymmetry'and the resulting generalizations are considered serious contenders for describing the real world .",
    "for some recent overviews of their prospects , see pati  @xcite and peskin @xcite .",
    "this is how we shall proceed . in section  [ sec : sm ]",
    "we start by describing the standard model . after a brief nod to the electron and photon",
    ", we explain some nuclear physics in section  [ sec : isospin ] .",
    "we start with heisenberg s old attempt to think of the proton and neutron as two states of a single particle , the ` nucleon ' , described by a 2-dimensional representation of @xmath8 .",
    "the idea of unification through representation theory traces its origins back to this notion .",
    "after this warmup we tour the standard model in its current form . in section  [ sec : fermions ] we describe the particles called ` fundamental fermions ' , which constitute matter . in section  [ sec : forces ] we describe the particles called ` gauge bosons ' , which carry forces .",
    "apart from the elusive higgs boson , all particles in the standard model are of these two kinds . in section  [ sec : smrep ]",
    "we give a more mathematical treatment of these ideas : the gauge bosons are determined by the standard model gauge group @xmath9 while the fundamental fermions and their antiparticles are basis vectors of a highly reducible representation of this group , which we call @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 describes the fermions , while @xmath12 describes their antiparticles .",
    "amazingly , using the ideas of gauge theory and quantum field theory , plus the ` higgs mechanism ' for symmetry breaking , we can recover the dynamical laws obeyed by these particles from the representation of @xmath13 on @xmath14 .",
    "this information is enough to decode the physics of these particles and make predictions about what is seen in the gigantic accelerators that experimental physicists use to probe the natural world at high energies .",
    "unfortunately , to explain all this would go far beyond the modest goals of this paper . for a guide to further study ,",
    "see section [ subsec : reading ] .",
    "having acquainted the reader with the standard model of particle physics in section  [ sec : sm ] , we then go on to talk about grand unified theories in section  [ sec : guts ] .",
    "these theories go beyond the standard model by ` extending ' the gauge group .",
    "that is , we pick a way to include @xmath13 in some larger group @xmath4 , and choose a representation @xmath5 of @xmath4 which reduces to the standard model representation @xmath10 when we restrict it to @xmath13 .",
    "we describe how this works for the @xmath1 theory ( section  [ sec : su(5 ) ] ) , the @xmath7 theory ( section  [ sec : so(10 ) ] ) , and the pati  salam model ( section  [ sec : g(2,2,4 ) ] ) . of course ,",
    "since we do not discuss the dynamics , a lot will go unsaid about these guts .",
    "as we proceed , we explain how the @xmath1 theory and the pati  salam model are based on two distinct visions about how to extend the standard model .",
    "however , we will see that the @xmath7 theory is an extension of both the @xmath1 theory ( section  [ sec : so(10 ) ] ) and the pati  salam model ( section  [ sec : route ] ) .",
    "moreover , these two routes to the @xmath7 theory are compatible in a precise sense : we get a commuting square of groups , and a commuting square of representations , which fit together to form a commuting cube ( section  [ sec : compatibility ] ) .    in section  [ sec : conclusion ]",
    ", we conclude by discussing what this means for physics : namely , how the standard model reconciles the two visions of physics lying behind the @xmath1 theory and the pati  salam model . in a sense , it is the intersection of the @xmath1 theory and the pati  salam model within their common unification , @xmath7 .",
    "throughout the course of the paper , we occasionally summarize our progress in theorems , most phrased in terms of commutative diagrams :    * section 3.1 , theorem [ thm : su(5 ) ] : the @xmath1 theory extends the standard model . *",
    "section 3.2 , theorem [ thm : spinor ] : the @xmath2 theory extends the @xmath1 theory . * section 3.3 , theorem [ thm : pati  salam ] : the pati ",
    "salam model extends the standard model . *",
    "section 3.4 , theorem [ thm : pati  salam2 ] : the pati",
    " salam model is isomorphic to a theory involving @xmath15 .",
    "* section 3.4 , theorem [ thm : pati  salam3 ] : the @xmath16 theory extends the standard model . *",
    "section 3.4 , theorem [ thm : spin(10 ) ] : the @xmath2 theory extends the @xmath15 theory . *",
    "section 3.5 , theorem [ thm : cube ] : the standard model , the @xmath1 theory , the @xmath15 theory and the @xmath2 theory fit together in a commutative cube . *",

    "* section 4 , theorem [ thm : pullbackspin(10 ) ] : the true gauge group of the standard model is the intersection of @xmath1 and @xmath18 in @xmath2 .",
    "we have tried to limit our prerequisites to the bare minimum .",
    "this includes basic facts about lie groups , lie algebras , and their representations  especially finite - dimensional unitary representations of compact lie groups .",
    "we will not need the structure theory for simple lie groups .",
    "we do , however , assume a little familiarity with the classical lie groups @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , as well as their lie algebras .",
    "there are countless books on lie groups , lie algebras and their representations , but the text by hall @xcite has everything we need , and more .",
    "sternberg s introduction to group theory and physics @xcite includes an excellent account of applications to particle physics . to see the subject more through the eyes of a physicist , try the books by lipkin @xcite or tinkham @xcite .",
    "text @xcite shows how the subject looks to one of the inventors of grand unified theories .    starting in section [ sec : su(5 ) ] we assume familiarity with exterior algebras , and in section [ sec : so(10 ) ] we also use clifford algebras . for what we need",
    ", chevalley s book @xcite is more than sufficient .",
    "for the interested reader , there are many introductions to particle physics where one can learn the dynamics after getting a taste of the algebra here .",
    "it might be good to start by reading griffiths introductory book  @xcite together with sudbery s text specially designed for mathematicians @xcite .",
    "the book by huang  @xcite delves as deep as one can go into the standard model without a heavy dose of quantum field theory , and the book by lee  @xcite is full of practical wisdom . for more information on grand unified theories ,",
    "see the textbooks by ross  @xcite and mohapatra  @xcite .",
    "particle physics relies heavily on quantum field theory .",
    "there are many books on this subject , none of which make it easy .",
    "prerequisites include a good understanding of classical mechanics , classical field theory and quantum mechanics .",
    "many physicists consider the books by brown @xcite and ryder @xcite to be the most approachable .",
    "the text by peskin and schroeder  @xcite offers a lot of physical insight , and we have also found zee s book  @xcite very useful in this respect .",
    "text  @xcite is clear about many details that other books gloss over  and it costs nothing ! of course",
    ", these books are geared toward physicists : mathematicians may find the lack of rigor frustrating .",
    "ticciati  @xcite provides a nice introduction for mathematicians , but anyone serious about this subject should quickly accept the fact that quantum field theory has not been made rigorous : this is a project for the century to come .    particle physics also relies heavily on geometry , especially gauge theory .",
    "this subject is easier to develop in a rigorous way , so there are plenty of texts that describe the applications to physics , but which a mathematician can easily understand .",
    "naber s books are a great place to start @xcite , and one of us has also written an elementary introduction @xcite .",
    "isham s text is elegant and concise @xcite , and many people swear by nakahara @xcite .",
    "the quantum field theory texts mentioned above also discuss gauge theory , but in language less familiar to mathematicians .",
    "finally , few things are more enjoyable than the history of nuclear and particle physics  a romantic tale full of heroic figures and tightly linked to the dark drama of world war ii , the manhattan project , and the ensuing cold war .",
    "crease and mann  @xcite give a very readable introduction . to dig deeper ,",
    "try the book by segr  @xcite , or the still more detailed treatments by pais  @xcite and hoddeson _ et al _  @xcite .",
    "today , most educated people know that the world is made of atoms , and that atoms , in turn , are made of electrons , protons , and neutrons .",
    "the electrons orbit a dense nucleus made of protons and neutrons , and as the outermost layer of any atom s structure , they are responsible for all chemistry .",
    "they are held close to the nucleus by electromagnetic forces : the electrons carry a negative electric charge , and protons carry a positive charge .",
    "opposite charges attract , and this keeps the electrons and the nucleus together .    at one point in time",
    ", electrons , protons , and neutrons were all believed to be fundamental and without any constituent parts , just as atoms themselves were once believed to be , before the discovery of the electron .",
    "electrons are the only one of these subatomic particles still considered fundamental , and it is with this venerable particle that we begin a table of the basic constituents of matter , called ` fundamental fermions ' .",
    "we will see more soon .",
    "1em    lcc + name & symbol & charge + electron & @xmath25 & -1 +    1em    since the electron is charged , it participates in electromagnetic interactions . from the modern perspective of quantum field theory ,",
    "electromagnetic interactions are mediated by the exchange of virtual photons , particles of light that we never see in the lab , but whose effects we witness whenever like charges are repelled or opposite charges are attracted .",
    "we depict this process with a diagram :    1em        1em    here , time runs up the page .",
    "two electrons come in , exchange a photon , and leave , slightly repelled from each other by the process .",
    "the photon is our next example of a fundamental particle , though it is of a different character than the electron and quarks . as a mediator of forces",
    ", the photon is known as a * gauge boson * in modern parlance .",
    "it is massless , and interacts only with charged particles , though it carries no charge itself .",
    "so , we begin our list of gauge bosons as follows :    1em    llc + force & gauge boson & symbol + electromagnetism & photon & @xmath26 +    1em      because like charges repel , it is remarkable that the atomic nucleus stays together .",
    "after all , the protons are all positively charged and are repelled from each other electrically . to hold these particles",
    "so closely together , physicists hypothesized a new force , the * strong force * , strong enough to overcome the electric repulsion of the protons .",
    "it must be strongest only at short distances ( about @xmath27 m ) , and then it must fall off rapidly , for protons are repelled electrically unless their separation is that small .",
    "neutrons must also experience it , because they are bound to the nucleus as well .",
    "physicists spent several decades trying to understand the strong force ; it was one of the principal problems in physics in the mid - twentieth century .",
    "about 1932 , werner heisenberg , pioneer in quantum mechanics , discovered one of the first clues to its nature .",
    "he proposed , in @xcite , that the proton and neutron might really be two states of the same particle , now called the * nucleon*. in modern terms , he attempted to unify the proton and neutron .    to understand how , we need to know a little quantum mechanics . in quantum mechanics , the state of any physical system is given by a unit vector in a complex hilbert space , and it is possible to take complex linear combinations of the system in different states .",
    "for example , the state for a quantum system , like a particle on a line , is a complex - valued function @xmath28 or if the particle is confined to a 1-dimensional box , so that its position lies in the unit interval @xmath29 $ ] , then its state lives in the hilbert space @xmath30)$ ] .",
    "we have special rules for combining quantum systems .",
    "if , say , we have two particles in a box , particle 1 and particle 2 , then the state is a function of both particle 1 s position and particle 2 s : @xmath31 \\times [ 0,1]),\\ ] ] but this is isomorphic to the tensor product of particle 1 s hilbert space with particle 2 s : @xmath32 \\times [ 0,1 ] ) { \\cong}l^2([0,1 ] \\otimes l^2([0,1]).\\ ] ] this is how we combine systems in general .",
    "if a system consists of one part with hilbert space @xmath5 _ and _ another part with hilbert space @xmath33 , their tensor product @xmath34 is the hilbert space of the combined system .",
    "heuristically , @xmath35 we just discussed the hilbert space for two particles in a single box .",
    "we now consider the hilbert space for a single particle in two boxes , by which we mean a particle that is in one box , say @xmath29 $ ] , _ or _ in another box , say @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "the hilbert space here is @xmath32 \\cup [ 2,3 ] ) { \\cong}l^2([0,1 ] ) \\oplus l^2([2,3]).\\ ] ] in general , if a system s state can lie in a hilbert space @xmath5 _ or _ in a hilbert space @xmath33 , the total hilbert space is then @xmath37 heuristically , @xmath38    back to nucleons .",
    "according to heisenberg s theory , a nucleon is a proton _ or _ a neutron .",
    "if we use the simplest nontrivial hilbert space for both the proton and neutron , namely @xmath39 , then the hilbert space for the nucleon should be @xmath40 the proton and neutron then correspond to basis vectors of this hilbert space : @xmath41 and @xmath42 but , we can also have a nucleon in a linear combination of these states .",
    "more precisely , the state of the nucleon can be represented by any unit vector in @xmath43 .",
    "the inner product in @xmath43 then allows us to compute probabilities , using the following rule coming from quantum mechanics : the probability that a system in state @xmath44 , a given hilbert space , will be observed in state @xmath45 is @xmath46 since @xmath47 and @xmath48 are orthogonal , there is no chance of seeing a proton as a neutron or vice versa , but for a nucleon in the state @xmath49 there is probability @xmath50 that measurement will result in finding a proton , and @xmath51 that measurement will result in finding a neutron .",
    "the condition that our state be a unit vector ensures that these probabilities add to 1 .    in order for this to be interesting , however , there must be processes that can turn protons and neutrons into different states of the nucleon .",
    "otherwise , there would be no point in having the full @xmath43 space of states .",
    "conversely , if there are processes which can change protons into neutrons and back , it turns out we need all of @xmath43 to describe them .",
    "heisenberg believed in such processes , because of an analogy between nuclear physics and atomic physics .",
    "the analogy turned out to be poor , based on the faulty notion that the neutron was composed of a proton and an electron , but the idea of the nucleon with states in @xmath43 proved to be a breakthrough .",
    "the reason is that in 1936 a paper by cassen and condon  @xcite appeared suggesting that the nucleon s hilbert space @xmath43 is acted on by the symmetry group @xmath8 .",
    "they emphasized the analogy between this and the spin of the electron , which is also described by vectors in @xmath43 , acted on by the double cover of the 3d rotation group , which is also @xmath8 . in keeping with this analogy ,",
    "the property that distinguishes the proton and neutron states of a nucleon was dubbed * isospin*. the proton was declared the * isospin up * state or @xmath52 state , and the neutron was declared the * isospin down * or @xmath53 state .",
    "cassen and condon s paper put isospin on its way to becoming a useful tool in nuclear physics .",
    "isospin proved useful because it formalized the following idea , which emerged from empirical data around the time of cassen and condon s paper .",
    "namely : the strong force , unlike the electromagnetic force , is the same whether the particles involved are protons or neutrons . protons and neutrons are interchangeable , as long as we neglect the small difference in their mass , and most importantly , as long as we neglect electromagnetic effects .",
    "one can phrase this idea in terms of group representation theory as follows : the strong force is _ invariant _ under the action of @xmath8 .",
    "though this idea was later seen to be an oversimplification , it foreshadowed modern ideas about unification .",
    "the proton , living in the representation @xmath39 of the trivial group , and the neutron , living in a different representation @xmath39 of the trivial group , were unified into the nucleon , with representation @xmath43 of @xmath8 .",
    "these symmetries hold for the strong force , but not for electromagnetism : we say this force ` breaks ' @xmath8 symmetry .",
    "but what does it mean , exactly , to say that a force is invariant under the action of some group ?",
    "it means that when we are studying particles interacting via this force , the hilbert space of each particle should be equipped with a unitary representation of this group .",
    "moreover , any physical process caused by this force should be described by an ` intertwining operator ' : that is , a linear operator that respects the action of this group .",
    "a bit more precisely , suppose @xmath5 and @xmath33 are finite - dimensional hilbert spaces on which some group @xmath4 acts as unitary operators .",
    "then a linear operator @xmath54 is an * intertwining operator * if @xmath55 for every @xmath56 and @xmath57 .    quite generally , symmetries give rise to conserved quantities . in quantum mechanics",
    "this works as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath4 is a lie group with a unitary representation on the finite - dimensional hilbert spaces @xmath5 and @xmath33 .",
    "then @xmath5 and @xmath33 automatically become representations of @xmath58 , the lie algebra of @xmath4 , and any intertwining operator @xmath54 respects the action of @xmath58 . in other words , @xmath59 for every @xmath56 and @xmath60 . next",
    "suppose that @xmath56 is an eigenvector of @xmath61 : @xmath62 for some real number @xmath63 .",
    "then it is easy to check @xmath64 is again an eigenvector of @xmath61 with the same eigenvalue : @xmath65",
    "so , the number @xmath63 is ` conserved ' by the operator @xmath11 .",
    "the element @xmath60 will act as a skew - adjoint operator on any unitary representation of @xmath4 .",
    "physicists prefer to work with self - adjoint operators since these have real eigenvalues . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "self - adjoint operators are called ` observables ' .",
    "we can get an observable by dividing @xmath61 by @xmath66 .    in casson and condon s isospin theory of the strong interaction ,",
    "the symmetry group @xmath4 is @xmath8 . here",
    "isospin , or more precisely @xmath67 , arises as above : it is just the eigenvalue of a certain element of @xmath68 , divided by @xmath66 to get a real number . because any physical process caused by the strong force is described by an intertwining operator ,",
    "_ isospin is conserved_. so , the total @xmath67 of any system remains unchanged after a process that involves only strong interactions .",
    "nevertheless , for the states in @xmath43 that mix protons and neutrons to have any meaning , there must be a mechanism which can convert protons into neutrons and vice versa . mathematically",
    ", we have a way to do this : the action of @xmath8 .",
    "what does this correspond to , physically ?",
    "the answer originates in the work of hideki yukawa . in the early 1930s",
    ", he predicted the existence of a particle that mediates the strong force , much as the photon mediates the electromagnetic force . from known properties of the strong force",
    ", he was able to predict that this particle should be about 200 times as massive as the electron , or about a tenth the mass of a proton .",
    "he predicted that experimentalists would find a particle with a mass in this range , and that it would interact strongly when it collided with nuclei .    partially because of the intervention of world war ii",
    ", it took over ten years for yukawa s prediction to be vindicated .",
    "after a famous false alarm ( see section  [ sec : generations ] ) , it became clear by 1947 that a particle with the expected properties had been found .",
    "it was called the * pion * and it came in three varieties : one with positive charge , the @xmath69 , one neutral , the @xmath70 , and one with negative charge , the @xmath71 .",
    "the pion proved to be the mechanism that can transform nucleons . to wit , we observe processes such as those in figure  [ fig : pin_vertices ] , where we have drawn the feynman diagrams which depict the nucleons absorbing pions , transforming where they are allowed to by charge conservation .",
    "cc   &   + @xmath72 & @xmath73 +   +   +   &   + @xmath74 & @xmath75 +    because of isospin conservation , we can measure the @xmath67 of a pion by looking at these interactions with the nucleons .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath67 of a pion is the same as its charge : 1em    [ cols=\"^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     1em putting these together we get the full pati ",

    "this map @xmath98 is also an isomorphism between representations of @xmath13 .",

    "the reason is that @xmath15 respects the @xmath242-grading on @xmath125 , and we have : @xmath243 moreover , the matter - antimatter grading and the right - left grading are _ all _ that @xmath15 respects , since each of the four spaces listed is an irrep of this group .    when we extend @xmath15 to the @xmath2 theory , we identify @xmath125 with @xmath103 .",
    "then the @xmath242-grading on @xmath125 gives the @xmath240-grading on @xmath103 using addition in @xmath240 .",
    "this sounds rather technical , but it is as simple as `` even + odd = odd '' : @xmath244 and `` odd + odd = even '' , `` even + even = even '' : @xmath245 recall that @xmath246 consists of all the fermions and antifermions that are _ right - handed _ , while @xmath247 consists of the _ left - handed _ ones .",
    "furthermore , the two routes to the @xmath2 theory that we have described , one going through @xmath1 and the other through @xmath15 , are compatible . in other words ,",
    "this cube commutes : @xmath230^\\phi \\ar[dl]_\\theta \\ar'[d ] [ ddd ] & & { { \\rm su}}(5 ) \\ar[dl]_\\psi \\ar[ddd ] \\\\ { { \\rm spin}}(4 ) \\times { { \\rm spin}}(6 ) \\ar[rr]^\\eta \\ar[ddd ] & & { { \\rm spin}}(10 ) \\ar[ddd ] & \\\\ & & & \\\\ & { { \\rm u}}(f \\oplus f^ * ) \\ar'[r]^(0.8){u(f)}[rr ] \\ar[dl]_-{{{\\rm u}}(h ) } & & { { \\rm u}}({\\lambda}{{\\mathbb c}}^5 ) \\ar[dl]_-1 \\\\ { { \\rm u}}({\\lambda}{{\\mathbb c}}^2 \\otimes { \\lambda}{{\\mathbb c}}^3 ) \\ar[rr]^-{{{\\rm u}}(g ) }   & & { { \\rm u}}({\\lambda}{{\\mathbb c}}^5 ) & \\\\ } \\ ] ]    so , all four theories fit together in an elegant algebraic pattern . what this means for physics ",
    "if anything  remains unknown .",
    "yet we can not resist feeling that it means something , and we can not resist venturing a guess : _ the standard model is exactly the theory that reconciles the visions built into the @xmath1 and @xmath15 theories .",
    "_    what this might mean is not yet precise , but since all these theories involve symmetries and representations , the ` reconciliation ' must take place at both those levels  and we can see _ this _ in a precise way .",
    "first , at the level of symmetries , our lie groups are related by the commutative square of homomorphisms : @xmath101^\\phi \\ar[d]_\\theta         & { { \\rm su}}(5 ) \\ar[d]^\\psi \\\\ { { \\rm spin}}(4 ) \\times { { \\rm spin}}(6 ) \\ar[r]^-\\eta & { { \\rm spin}}(10 ) } \\ ] ] because this commutes , the image of @xmath13 lies in the intersection of the images of @xmath15 and @xmath1 inside @xmath2 .",
    "but we claim it is _ precisely _ that intersection !    to see this , first recall that the image of a group under a homomorphism is just the quotient group formed by modding out the kernel of that homomorphism .",
    "if we do this for each of our homomorphisms above , we get a commutative square of inclusions : @xmath248 \\ar@{^{(}->}[d ] & { { \\rm su}}(5 ) \\ar@{^{(}->}[d ] \\\\",
    "\\displaystyle\\frac{{{\\rm spin}}(4 ) \\times { { \\rm spin}}(6)}{{{\\mathbb z}}_2 }   \\ar@{^{(}->}[r ] & { { \\rm spin}}(10 ) \\\\ } \\ ] ] this implies that @xmath249 as subgroups of @xmath2 . to make good on our claim",
    ", we must show these subgroups are equal : @xmath250 in other words , our commutative square of inclusions is a ` pullback square ' .    as a step towards showing this ,",
    "first consider what happens when we pass from the spin groups to the rotation groups .",
    "we can accomplish this by modding out by an additional @xmath240 above .",
    "we get another commutative square of inclusions : @xmath248 \\ar@{^{(}->}[d ] & { { \\rm su}}(5 ) \\ar@{^{(}->}[d ] \\\\ { { \\rm so}}(4 ) \\times { { \\rm so}}(6 )   \\ar@{^{(}->}[r ] & { { \\rm so}}(10 ) \\\\ } \\ ] ] here the reader may wonder why we could quotient @xmath251 and @xmath2 by @xmath240 without having to do the same for their respective subgroups , @xmath252 and @xmath1 .",
    "it is because @xmath240 intersects both of those subgroups trivially .",
    "we can see this for @xmath1 because we know the inclusion @xmath253 is just the lift of the inclusion @xmath254 to universal covers , so it makes this diagram commute : @xmath255 \\ar@{^{(}->}[dr ] & { { \\rm spin}}(10 ) \\ar[d]^p \\\\                                          & { { \\rm so}}(10 ) \\\\ } \\ ] ] but this means that @xmath1 intersects @xmath256 in only the identity .",
    "the subgroup @xmath252 therefore intersects @xmath240 trivially as well .          to begin with",
    ", the group @xmath7 is the group of orientation - preserving symmetries of the 10-dimensional real inner product space @xmath261 . but @xmath261 is suspiciously like @xmath237 , a 5-dimensional complex inner product space . indeed , if we forget the complex structure on @xmath237 , we get an isomorphism @xmath262 , a real inner product space with symmetries @xmath7",
    ". we can consider the subgroup of @xmath7 that preserves the original complex structure .",
    "this is @xmath263 . if we further pick a volume form on @xmath237 , i.e. a nonzero element of @xmath264 , and look at the symmetries fixing that volume form , we get a copy of @xmath265 .",
    "then we can pick a @xmath266 splitting on @xmath260 . the subgroup of @xmath1 that also preserves",
    "this is @xmath267 these inclusions form the top and right sides of our square : @xmath248 \\ar@{^{(}->}[d ] & { { \\rm su}}(5 ) \\ar@{^{(}->}[d ] \\\\ { { \\rm so}}(4 ) \\times { { \\rm so}}(6 )   \\ar@{^{(}->}[r ] & { { \\rm so}}(10 ) \\\\ } \\ ] ]    we can also reverse the order of these processes . imposing a @xmath266 splitting on @xmath237 yields a @xmath268 splitting on the underlying real vector space , @xmath269 .",
    "the subgroup of @xmath7 that preserves this splitting is @xmath270 : the block diagonal matrices with @xmath271 and @xmath272 orthogonal blocks and overall determinant 1 .",
    "the connected component of this subgroup is @xmath122 .",
    "the direct summands in @xmath273 came from forgetting the complex structure on @xmath274 .",
    "the subgroup of @xmath270 preserving the original complex structure is @xmath275 , and the subgroup of this that also fixes a volume form on @xmath237 is @xmath276 .",
    "this group is connected , so it must lie entirely in the connected component of the identity , and we get the inclusions : @xmath277 these maps form the left and bottom sides of our square .",
    "it follows that @xmath252 is precisely the subgroup of @xmath7 that preserves a complex structure on @xmath261 , a chosen volume form on the resulting complex vector space , and a @xmath259 splitting on this space .",
    "but this @xmath259 splitting is the same as a _ compatible _",
    "@xmath268 splitting of @xmath261 , one in which each summand is a complex vector subspace as well as a real subspace .",
    "this means that @xmath278 and since @xmath252 is connected , @xmath279 as desired .",
    "3em 2ex        _ proof .",
    "_ by now we have built the following commutative diagram : @xmath248 ^ -{\\tilde \\phi } \\ar@{^{(}->}[d]_{\\tilde \\theta }   & { { \\rm su}}(5 ) \\ar@{^{(}->}[d]^\\psi \\\\ ( { { \\rm spin}}(4 ) \\times { { \\rm spin}}(6))/{{{\\mathbb z}}_2 } \\ar@{^{(}->}[r]^-{\\tilde \\eta } \\ar[d]_q & { { \\rm spin}}(10 ) \\ar[d]^p \\\\ { { \\rm so}}(4 ) \\times { { \\rm so}}(6 )   \\ar@{^{(}->}[r]^-i & { { \\rm so}}(10 )   } \\ ] ] where both the bottom vertical arrows are two - to - one , but the composite vertical maps @xmath281 and @xmath282 are one - to - one .",
    "our previous theorem says that the big square with @xmath281 and @xmath282 as vertical sides is a pullback .",
    "now we must show that the upper square is also a pullback .",
    "so , suppose we are given @xmath283 and @xmath284 with @xmath285 we need to show there exists @xmath286 such that @xmath287 now , we know that @xmath288 so since the big square is a pullback , there exists @xmath289 with @xmath290 the second equation is half of what we need to show .",
    "so , we only need to check that the first equation implies @xmath291 .",
    "the kernel of @xmath292 consists of two elements , which we will simply call @xmath293 . since @xmath294 , we know @xmath295 since @xmath296",
    ", we thus have @xmath297 the one - to - one map @xmath298 sends the kernel of @xmath292 to the kernel of @xmath47 , which consists of two elements that we may again call @xmath293 .",
    "so , @xmath299 . on the other hand ,",
    "since the top square commutes we know @xmath300 .",
    "thus the element @xmath293 must actually be @xmath301 , so @xmath302 as desired .",
    "3em 2ex      we can ` break the symmetry ' of the @xmath2 theory in two different ways . in the first way , we start by picking the subgroup of @xmath2 that preserves the @xmath241-grading and volume form in @xmath100 . this is @xmath1",
    ". then we pick the subgroup of @xmath1 that respects the splitting of @xmath237 into @xmath274 .",
    "this subgroup is the standard model gauge group , modulo a discrete subgroup , and its representation on @xmath100 is the standard model representation .",
    "we can draw this symmetry breaking process in the following diagram : @xmath101 ^ -\\phi \\ar[d ] & { { \\rm su}}(5 ) \\ar[r]^-\\psi \\ar[d ] & { { \\rm spin}}(10 ) \\ar[d ] \\\\ { { \\rm u}}(f \\oplus f^ * ) \\ar[r]^-{{{\\rm u}}(f ) } & { { \\rm u}}({\\lambda}{{\\mathbb c}}^5 ) \\ar[r]^-1 & { { \\rm u}}({\\lambda}{{\\mathbb c}}^5 ) \\\\ \\ar@{<~}[r]^{\\mbox { splitting } } & \\ar@{<~}[r]^{\\mbox{grading and}}_{\\mbox{volume form } } & } \\ ] ] the @xmath1 theory shows up as a ` halfway house ' here .",
    "we can also break the symmetry of @xmath2 in a way that uses the @xmath15 theory as a halfway house .",
    "we do essentially the same two steps as before , but in the reverse order ! this time we start by picking the subgroup of @xmath2 that respects the splitting of @xmath261 as @xmath273 .",
    "this subgroup is @xmath15 modulo a discrete subgroup .",
    "the two factors in this subgroup act separately on the factors of @xmath303",

    "this subgroup is the standard model gauge group , modulo a discrete subgroup , and its representation on @xmath125 is the standard model representation .",
