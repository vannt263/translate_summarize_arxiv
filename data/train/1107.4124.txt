    "there have been a number of experiments examining the behavior of colloids interacting with ordered substrates such as two - dimensional square and triangular trap arrays created by optical means @xcite .",
    "many of the observed orderings for repulsively interacting colloids on periodic substrates have similar structures to those of vortices in type - ii superconductors with periodic arrays of pinning sites @xcite .",
    "the colloids and vortices can be driven over the substrates via an applied current , fluid flow , electric fields , or other optical means @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to create systems with asymmetric substrates which produce directed motion of particles even in the absence of an external dc drive @xcite . by applying an ac drive or by flashing the substrate , a net dc flow of particles can be induced which is termed a ratchet effect @xcite . in two dimensions",
    "ratchet effects can occur in the presence of symmetric substrates when some other symmetry is broken , such as with a rotating ac drive @xcite or by dynamically switching the substrate in a certain order @xcite .",
    "the ratchet effect has been demonstrated for colloids on asymmetric substrates @xcite and symmetric substrates with asymmetric drives @xcite , for cold atom systems with flashing substrates @xcite , for vortices in type - ii superconductors with asymmetric pinning sites @xcite , for vibrated granular matter on asymmetric substrates @xcite , and for driven liquid drops on asymmetric heated plates @xcite .",
    "applications of the ratchet effect include sorting of different particles which ratchet at different rates over the substrate . in the overdamped single particle limit the ratchet effect generally occurs in a single direction ; however , in collections of interacting particles , ratchet reversals can arise where the dc flow reverses as a parameter is varied @xcite .",
    "in all the ratchet systems mentioned above there is some form of external drive , such as a single ac drive , flashing of the substrate , or multiple external oscillating drives .",
    "there are many systems , termed active matter systems , that exhibit motion in the absence of any external drive .",
    "examples include self - catalyzing colloidal particles @xcite , microscopic artificial swimmers @xcite , swimming bacteria , and active cells @xcite .",
    "recently , experiments were conducted for swimming bacteria in the presence of an array of asymmetric funnels @xcite .",
    "no directed motion occurs for brownian particles or nonswimming bacteria , but when swimming bacteria are added , a ratchet effect occurs and the bacteria concentrate on one side of the funnel array . due to the complexity of the bacterial system",
    ", there are a wide variety of possible mechanisms for the concentration including hydrodynamic interactions , chemotaxis , or collective motions of the bacteria ; however , a simple model of individual particles undergoing run and tumble dynamics along with a wall - following rule reproduces all of the experimental observations including the buildup of particles in the funnel tips and along the walls @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the particles move in a single direction over a run length @xmath0 during a fixed run time @xmath1 , which is the time between tumbling events .",
    "every @xmath1 simulation time steps , the particles randomly reorient and move in a new single direction over a distance @xmath0 until the next tumbling event a time @xmath2 later .",
    "when the particle encounters a barrier , it moves along the barrier with a speed determined by the component of its running motion that is parallel to the barrier until the next tumbling event or until reaching the end of the barrier . if @xmath1 is small , @xmath0 is small and the particles act more brownian - like , with no rectification occurring for the limit of infinitesimal @xmath1 .",
    "the addition of steric interactions or thermal fluctuations reduces the rectification , while the rectification is enhanced when @xmath3 is increased . with a similar model",
    "it was numerically shown and demonstrated in experiment that an asymmetric fly - wheel rotates in a preferred direction in the presence of a bacterial bath @xcite .",
    "other theoretical and numerical work @xcite has demonstrated rectification in swimming bacteria that obey run - and - tumble dynamics under conditions in which , due to long running lengths , the particles accumulate and run along the walls .",
    "this work assumed no hydrodynamic interactions indicating that hydrodynamic effects are not required to produce rectification .",
    "the authors also mention that for bacteria that collide elastically with the walls , no rectification occurs .",
    "other experiments have also shown directed cellular motion over asymmetric substrates @xcite and even different directions of motion for different cell types on the same substrate @xcite . unlike the bacterial case ,",
    "the mechanics of how the eukaryotic cells move is very important and the latter can not be modeled simply by point particles .",
    "these studies open a new field of controlling active matter using periodic and asymmetric substrates .",
    "if the motion of self driven particles can be well controlled , it may be possible to use the particles to perform microscopic work such as transporting larger obstacles or cargo .",
    "additionally , biological sorting could be achieved via ratchet effects . in this work",
    "we investigate the rules for run - and - tumble particles which generate a net dc motion of active matter in the presence of asymmetric barriers .",
    "we find that if the particles are fully aligned with the barriers , a much stronger rectification effect occurs .",
    "if the particles reflect or scatter off the barriers than no ratchet effect occurs even for very large @xmath0 .",
    "this shows that the rectification requires the breaking of detailed balance in the interactions with the asymmetric barriers .",
    "we also find that there is a build up of particles along the barriers similar to what is observed in experiment @xcite .",
    "this build up is due to the wall following rule combined with the finite size of the system .",
    "if the tumbling times of the particles are synchronized , we find that patterned moving density fronts of particles occur after the particles accumulate in corners of the containers or in the funnel tips .",
    "figure  1 shows an image of our system which consists of an @xmath4 two - dimensional box of length @xmath5 with confining walls in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 directions containing @xmath8 active particles . in the center of the system",
    "is an array of asymmetric funnels , placed in the same geometry used in the experiments for the swimming bacteria @xcite .",
    "the particle density is @xmath9 .",
    "the particles move in an overdamped media without hydrodynamic interactions according to the overdamped equation of motion @xmath10 here @xmath11 is a phenomenological damping term . the time dependent motor force @xmath12 is represented by run and tumble dynamics . here",
    "@xmath13 while @xmath14 is selected randomly and changed every @xmath2 simulation time steps .",
    "the resulting run length @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the simulation time step size .",
    "2(a ) shows a single active particle with @xmath17 and @xmath18 moving in straight paths for extended distances before randomly orienting and moving in other directions , producing a time average velocity of zero . with smaller @xmath1 the length scale over which the motion appears brownian decreases , as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) for @xmath19 .",
    "many active matter systems contain thermal fluctuations which we represent as langevin kicks with the term @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "2(c ) illustrates the combination of run and tumble dynamics with thermal fluctuations .",
    "we initially consider @xmath24 since in many active matter systems at room temperature , such as bacteria , the thermal fluctuations are small on the scale of the particles .",
    "the term @xmath25 is the particle - particle interaction force which is modeled as simple short ranged steric repulsion .",
    "the term @xmath26 is the force from the barriers which are each modeled by two half - parabolic domes of strength @xmath27 and radius of @xmath28 which repel particles along the direction perpendicular to the trap axis .",
    "@xmath29 here the total number of barriers including the confining walls is @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36/r_{ik}^{\\perp}$ ] .",
    "@xmath37 is the position of particle @xmath38 ( barrier @xmath39 ) , and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) is a unit vector parallel ( perpendicular ) to the axis of barrier @xmath39 .",
    "the funnels are modeled as two barriers meeting at a common end point at angles @xmath42 and @xmath43 with the @xmath6-axis and the tips of adjacent funnels are spaced a distance @xmath44 apart along the @xmath6 direction .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "this work in conjunction with experiments shows that simple substrates can be used to create directed motion in self - driven particle systems .",
    "this opens the possibility for an entirely new class of ratchets based on microscale systems which could be used for sorting different species of active particles , guiding particles to move in certain directions , and possibly even extracting work out of such systems .",
    "our results show that thermal fluctuations can strongly reduce the efficiency of the directed motion . for large colloids and many biological systems ,",
    "thermal effects are generally small on the scale of the particles ; however , if nanoscale self - driven particles are considered then thermal effects will be relevant .",
    "our work and other models of this type of system include only point particles or elongated rods",
    ". it would be interesting to study ratcheting behavior for particles with more complicated shapes or for particles that contain internal degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , eukaryotic cells exhibit different types of mechanical mechanisms for locomotion such as pushing or pulling motions , and it could be possible to implement swimming rules that mimic such motions .",
    "we have studied only static substrates in our system ; however , it should be possible to create dynamic substrates for self - driven particles similar to flashing ratchets , and such dynamic substrates might be much more effective in directing the motion of the particles .",
    "it would also be interesting to study different types of collective effects such as by introducing models for flocking or swarming behaviors or by adding longer range interactions between particles which could arise through hydrodynamic effects .",
    "although the model we consider is mostly relevant for microscopic systems , similar effects could be tested for larger scale systems such as individual or collectively moving insects , animals , and birds .",
    "another possibility would be to study self - driven particles that have an intrinsic asymmetry as they move through symmetric or asymmetric substrates .",
    "we have shown that a new type of ratchet system can arise in systems of self - driven particles or active particles in asymmetric geometries .",
    "unlike most ratchet systems where some form of external ac force or flashing potential is required to induce a ratchet effect , the self - driven particle system can exhibit a ratchet effect in the absence of external forcing . in our system",
    "we consider active particles that move with a run - and - tumble dynamics of the type found in bacterial systems where the particles move in a single direction for a fixed time before undergoing a tumbling event , randomly reorienting , and then moving for a fixed period of time in a new direction .",
    "we studied different rules for the interactions between the particles and the barriers , including alignment or partial alignment with the barrier which causes the particles to follow the barriers as well as reflection and scattering interactions . when the particles are allowed to move along the barriers and when the time between tumbling events is sufficiently long , we observe rectification of the particles by the barriers .",
    "we also find a buildup of particles along the walls and inside the funnel tips .",
    "both the rectification and the buildup of the particles along the barriers are in excellent agreement with experimental observations . under these same wall interaction rules , if the time between tumbling events is very small the motion of the particles becomes more brownian - like on the length scale of the barriers and the rectification is lost . for reflection and scattering of the particles off the barriers",
    "the rectification is lost even for very long times between tumbling events .",
    "these results show that it is the combination of the running length and the breaking of detailed balance in the particle - barrier interactions that produce the rectification .",
    "we have also found that if the tumbling times for the particles are synchronized , pattern formation occurs in the form of moving density fronts generated after each switching event due to the concentration of particles in the corners and funnel tips .",
    "the addition of thermal effects or steric interactions generally reduces the effectiveness of the rectification .",
    "future directions to pursue include more complicated shapes and interactions for the individual particles as well as the addition of collective effects .",
