    "in this paper , we utilize techniques inspired by riemannian geometry and the theory of stochastic processes in order to control eigenvalues of graphs . in particular , we shall quantify the deviation of a ( connected , undirected , weighted , finite ) graph @xmath1 from being bipartite ( a bipartite graph is one without cycles of odd lengths ; equivalently , its vertex set can be split into two classes such that edges can be present only between vertices from different classes ) in terms of a spectral gap .",
    "the operator whose spectrum we shall consider here is the normalized graph laplacian @xmath0 ( it is unitarily equivalent to the one studied in chung @xcite ) .",
    "this is the operator underlying random walks on graphs , and so , this leads to a natural connection with the theory of stochastic processes .",
    "we observe that on a bipartite graph , a random walker , starting at a vertex @xmath14 at time 0 and at each step hopping to one of the neighbors of the vertex where it currently sits , can revisit @xmath14 only at even times .",
    "this connection then will be explored via the eigenvalues of @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , the largest eigenvalue @xmath12 of @xmath0 is 2 iff @xmath1 is bipartite and is @xmath15 else .",
    "therefore , @xmath16 quantifies the deviation of @xmath1 from being bipartite , and we want to understand this aspect in more detail . in more general terms , we are asking for a quantitative connection between the geometry ( of the graph @xmath1 ) and the analysis ( of the operator @xmath0 , or the random walk encoded by it ) .",
    "now , such connections have been explored systematically in riemannian geometry , and many eigenvalue estimates are known there that connect the corresponding laplace operator with the geometry of the underlying space @xmath17 , see e.g. li - yau @xcite , chavel @xcite .",
    "the crucial role here is played by the ricci curvature of @xmath17 . in recent years , a kind of axiomatic approach to curvature has been developed .",
    "this approach encodes the abstract formal properties of curvature and thereby makes the notion extendible to spaces more general than riemannian manifolds . by now , there exist many notions of generalized curvature , and several of them have found important applications , see sturm @xcite , lott - villani @xcite , ollivier @xcite , ohta @xcite , bonciocat - sturm @xcite , joulin - ollivier @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the curvature notion that turns out to be most useful for our purposes is the one introduced by ollivier @xcite .",
    "one of our main results says that @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a lower bound for ollivier s ricci curvature .",
    "this matches quite well with ollivier s result that the smallest nonzero eigenvalue @xmath11 satisfies @xmath20 in fact , one of the main points of the present paper is to relate such upper and lower bounds via random walks .",
    "in fact , as in bauer - jost @xcite , we translate this relationship into the geometric concept of a neighborhood graph .",
    "the idea here is that in the @xmath9-th neighborhood graph @xmath4 $ ] of @xmath1 , vertices @xmath14 and @xmath21 are connected by an edge with a weight given by the probability that a random walker starting at @xmath14 reaches @xmath21 after @xmath9 steps times the degree of @xmath14 .",
    "we note that even though the original graph may have been unweighted , the neighborhood graphs @xmath4 $ ] are necessarily weighted .",
    "in addition , they will in general possess self - loops , because the random walker starting at @xmath14 may return to @xmath14 after @xmath9 steps .",
    "therefore , we need to develop our theory on weighted graphs with self - loops even though the original @xmath1 might have been unweighted and without such loops .",
    "since ollivier s curvature is defined in terms of transportation distances ( wasserstein metrics ) , we can then use our neighborhood graphs in order to geometrically control the transportation costs and thereby to estimate the curvature of the neighborhood graphs in terms of the curvature of the original graph . as it turns out that lower bounds for the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath22 $ ] are related to upper bounds for the largest eigenvalue of @xmath1",
    ", we can then use methods for controlling the smallest eigenvalue to also obtain ( [ 0a ] ) . for controlling the smallest eigenvalue , besides ollivier @xcite , we also refer to lin - yau @xcite and jost - liu @xcite . in particular , in the last paper",
    ", we could relate @xmath11 to the local clustering coefficient introduced in watts - strogatz @xcite .",
    "the local clustering coefficients measures the relative local frequency of triangles , that is , cycles of length 3 .",
    "since bipartite graphs can not possess any triangles , this then is obviously related to our question about quantifying the deviation of the given graph @xmath1 from being bipartite .",
    "in fact , in jost - liu @xcite , this local clustering has been controlled in terms of ollivier s ricci curvature .",
    "thus , in the present paper we are closing the loop between the geometric properties of a graph @xmath1 , the spectrum of its graph laplacian , random walks on @xmath1 , and the generalized curvature of @xmath1 , drawing upon deep ideas and concepts originally developed in riemannian geometry and the theory of stochastic processes .",
    "in this paper , @xmath23 will denote an undirected , weighted , connected , finite graph of @xmath24 vertices .",
    "we do not exclude loops , i.e. , we permit the existence of an edge between a vertex and itself .",
    "@xmath25 denotes the set of vertices and @xmath26 denotes the set of edges .",
    "if two vertices @xmath27 are connected by an edge , we say @xmath14 and @xmath21 are neighbors , in symbols @xmath28 .",
    "the associated weight function @xmath29 : @xmath30 satisfies @xmath31 ( because the graph is undirected ) and we assume @xmath32 whenever @xmath28 and @xmath33 iff @xmath34 ; thus , we do not permit negative weights . for a vertex @xmath35 ,",
    "its degree @xmath36 is defined as @xmath37 . if @xmath38 whenever @xmath28 , we shall call the graph an unweighted one .",
    "we will also speak of a locally finite graph @xmath39 , which is an undirected , weighted , connected graph and satisfies the property that for every @xmath40 , the number of edges connected to @xmath14 is finite .      in this subsection",
    ", we recall the definition of the normalized graph laplace operator and state some of its basic properties .",
    "in particular , we will emphasize the relations between eigenvalues of the laplace operator and random walks on graphs .",
    "let @xmath41 denote the space of all real - valued functions on the set @xmath25 .",
    "we attach to each vertex @xmath35 a probability measure @xmath42 and then can define the laplace operator .",

    "we will choose @xmath45 in the following .",
    "note that @xmath46 is possible when @xmath14 has a loop . with this family of probability measures",
    "@xmath47 , @xmath0 is just the normalized graph laplace operator studied in grigoryan @xcite and bauer - jost @xcite and is unitarily equivalent to the laplace operator studied in chung @xcite .    on a graph @xmath1 without loops , we can also consider a lazy random walk . a lazy random walk is a random walk that does not move with a certain probability , i.e. for some @xmath14 we might have @xmath48 . in this case , the lazy random walk on @xmath1 is equivalent to the usual random walk on the graph @xmath49 that is obtained from @xmath1 by adding for every vertex @xmath14 a loop with a weight @xmath50 .",
    "we also have a natural measure @xmath51 on the whole set @xmath25 , @xmath52 which gives an inner product structure on @xmath41 .",
    "the inner product of two functions @xmath53 is defined as @xmath54    then @xmath41 becomes a hilbert space , and we can write @xmath55 . by the definition of the degree and the symmetry of the weight function , we can check that    * @xmath51 is invariant w.r.t .",

    "i.e. @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "these two facts imply immediately that the operator @xmath0 is nonpositive and self - adjoint on the space @xmath60 .",
    "we call @xmath61 an eigenvalue of @xmath0 if there exists some @xmath62 such that @xmath63using this convention it follows from the observation that @xmath0 is self - adjoint and nonpositive that all its eigenvalues are real and nonnegative .",
    "in fact , it s well known that ( see e.g. chung @xcite ) @xmath64since our graph is connected we actually have @xmath65 . in chung",
    "@xcite it is shown , by proving a discrete version of the cheeger inequality , that @xmath11 is a measure for how easy / difficult it is to cut the graph into two large pieces . furthermore , @xmath66 if and only if @xmath1 is bipartite . in bauer - jost @xcite it is shown , by establishing a dual version of the cheeger inequality for the largest eigenvalue , that @xmath12 is a measure of the size of a locally bipartite subgraph that is connected by only a few edges to the rest in the graph . in the following , we will call @xmath11 the first eigenvalue and @xmath12 the largest eigenvalue of the operator @xmath0 .      in this subsection ,",
