    "in the standard model , the higgs boson is introduced to explain the electroweak symmetry breaking and the origin of fermion masses .",
    "the direct search at the cern @xmath13 collider ( lep2 ) presents a lower limit on the higgs boson mass of @xmath14 @xmath15 114.4 gev/@xmath8 at the 95@xmath12 confidence level ( c.l . ) .",
    "indirect measurements , electroweak global fits , give an upper limit of 144 gev/@xmath8 at the 95@xmath12 c.l . which increases to 182 gev/@xmath9 when the direct search is included  @xcite .",
    "our physics objective is to search for the low - mass fermiophobic higgs and the high - mass standard model higgs boson using like - sign dilepton events produced by @xmath16 the relevant higgs mass regions are above 110 gev/@xmath8 for the fermiophobic higgs where the branching fraction of @xmath17 supersedes that of @xmath18 , and above 160 gev/@xmath8 for the standard model higgs where the branching fraction of @xmath19 is overtaken by this channel .",
    "the fermiophobic higgs boson has no coupling to the fermions .",
    "existence of the fermiophobic higgs could be an indication that the origin of particle masses would be different for the bosons and the fermions .",
    "such a particle can also arise as a cp - even scalar @xmath20 in the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) type i. the model has seven degrees of freedom : the five particle masses ( @xmath20,@xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) and two angles ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) . in the type i , the lightest cp - even scalar @xmath20 couples to a fermion proportionally to @xmath26 , and the @xmath20 becomes a fermiophobic higgs when @xmath27 .",
    "this analysis is based on the data with an integrated luminosity of 1.9 fb@xmath28 collected with the cdf - ii detector between march 2002 and may 2007 .",
    "detailed descriptions of the cdf - ii detector can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the data are collected with inclusive lepton triggers that requires an electron with transverse energy ( @xmath29 ) @xmath15 18 gev or a muon with transverse momentum ( @xmath30 ) @xmath15 18 gev/@xmath31 . starting from the inclusive lepton datasets , we apply a number of event selection criteria to obtain a baseline dilepton sample .",
    "the events are required to have primary vertices within the region to ensure well - defined measurement of collisions by the detector and to pass a cosmic - ray veto .",
    "we select events at least one electron with @xmath32 20 gev and @xmath33 10 gev/@xmath31 , or muon with @xmath33 20 gev/@xmath31 , which is considered to be responsible for firing the triggers we have chosen , and at least one other electron with @xmath32 6 gev and @xmath33 6 gev/@xmath31 , or muon with @xmath33 6 gev/@xmath31 , as the baseline dilepton selection .",
    "the leptons must be found in the central detector ( @xmath34 1.1 ) and within fiducial regions of the sub - detectors .",
    "they are also required to be isolated in terms of the calorimeter cone - isolation , with a cone size of @xmath35 0.4 , to be less than 2 gev , where @xmath36 is the radius in the @xmath37-@xmath38 space , @xmath39 is the pseudorapidity , the @xmath40 is the polar angle with respect to the proton beam direction , and @xmath38 is the azimuthal angle . the leptons must have a well - measured track , found both in the outer tracking chamber and the inner silicon detector , with the @xmath41 coordinate and the impact parameter at the closest approach point to the beamline being consistent with coming from the primary vertex .",
    "we then apply a series of lepton identification cuts which impose various internal consistencies of information obtained from sub - detectors and require detector responses consistent with electrons or muons .",
    "if the electron is consistent with being due to a photon conversion as indicated by the presence of an additional nearby track , the electron is vetoed .    for the exactly two - lepton events passing our selection above , we explicitly require a cut to ensure that the two leptons are coming from the same vertex , and also apply a dilepton mass cut ( @xmath42 12 gev/@xmath8 ) and a @xmath43-event veto .",
    "we finally require the like - sign charge combination to complete the baseline event selection . the final cut to obtain the result is discussed in  [ sec : fin ] .",
    "although the like - sign requirement is quite effective to suppress qcd and known electroweak processes , we expect that fake - lepton backgrounds and residual photon - conversions still remain at a considerable level in the events of our signature .",
    "they are estimated by data - driven methods , while other backgrounds containing prompt real - leptons ( physics backgrounds ) are estimated by monte carlo ( mc ) data .",
    "the physics backgrounds can be classified into reducible and irreducible backgrounds .",
    "the reducible backgrounds are drell - yan , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and w + ( heavy - flavor hadrons ) , while irreducible backgrounds are @xmath46 and @xmath44 .",
    "the reducible backgrounds are reduced by the isolation cut and like - sign requirement .",
    "contributions of the irreducible backgrounds are small due to their small production cross sections , which are further suppressed by the @xmath43-event veto . since fake - leptons and residual photon - conversions are estimated separately using real data , we reject them found in the mc by looking at the generator - level information to avoid double counting .",
    "the residual photon - conversion backgrounds arise from an electron originating from the photon conversion with an unobserved partner track due to its low momentum .",
    "we estimate the backgrounds by multiplying lepton + conversion events by residual photon - conversion rate ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "we define the rate by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the conversion detection efficiency .",
    "the efficiency is measured by comparing the conversions found in the real data with conversion mc samples that are tuned to match with the sub - sample of real conversions in the high-  region of partner - tracks where the efficiency is well known .",
    "the residual conversion rate is parametrized by the parent photon  and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rcfr ] left .",
    "the fake electron backgrounds are interactive @xmath50 , overlap of @xmath51 and a track , and residual photon - conversions .",
    "the fake muon backgrounds are punch - through hadrons and decay - in - flight muons from @xmath50 and @xmath52 .",
    "we also regard leptons from semileptonic decays of heavy - flavor hadron as one of fake lepton backgrounds .",
    "these background objects are common in generic qcd events .",
    "we estimate the backgrounds by multiplying lepton + isolated track events by the fake lepton rates derived from inclusive jet samples .",
    "the fake lepton rate ( @xmath53 ) is defined as a rate of leptons in the jet samples relative to isolated tracks with certain energy depositions especially in the hadron calorimeters .",
    "the  cut is 6  in accordance with the lower  cut of our baseline event selection .",
    "we reject @xmath0 and @xmath43 events to find leptons in the jet samples to avoid prompt real - leptons from electroweak processes .",
    "the fake lepton rate is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rcfr ] right .",
    "the fake electron rates go through corrections to subtract residual conversions in the jet samples because we estimate the amount of residual photon - conversion events separately as mentioned in the previous section .",
    "comparisons of kinematics distributions and the number of events between the data and the background prediction for the like - sign dilepton events after the baseline selection are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lskine ] and table  [ tab : cdfvsbg ] , where we categorize electron - muon pairs into @xmath54 and @xmath55 depending on which lepton has the leading  and fires the corresponding lepton trigger .",
    "we further examine the baseline like - sign dilepton events on the 2 dimensional plane of the 2nd lepton @xmath1 ( @xmath5 ) versus the dilepton system @xmath1 ( @xmath7 ) . by scanning this 2d plane with moving @xmath5 and @xmath7 cut values",
    ", we see no significant discrepancies between the data and the background expectations .",
    "we then determine the optimized cut values for signal events to get minimized expected upper limit on the production cross section times branching fraction ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2d ] ) .",
    "the final cut is set to @xmath56 20 gev/@xmath31 and @xmath57 15 gev/@xmath31 . with this cut",
    ", we define 4 regions :    * region1 : @xmath58 gev/@xmath31 and @xmath59 gev/@xmath31 * region2 : @xmath60 gev/@xmath31 and @xmath59 gev/@xmath31 * region3 : @xmath60 gev/@xmath31 and @xmath61 gev/@xmath31 * region4 : @xmath58 gev/@xmath31 and @xmath61 gev/@xmath31    table  [ tab : cdfvsbg_2d ] shows event counting for each region .",
    "we see reasonable agreement between the expected number of backgrounds and observed events .",
    "table  [ tab : sigaccsys ] ( left ) shows the signal efficiencies , where the denominator is the number of @xmath62 events .",
    "the branching fraction corresponding to events with at least 2 leptons from triple @xmath0s is about 0.12 .",
    "the efficiencies are multiplied with mc scale factors which are obtained by using drell - yan events found in the data and mc .",
    "the uncertainties in table  [ tab : sigaccsys ] ( right ) include mc statistics and uncertainties of mc scale factors .",
    "we estimate systematic uncertainties from several other sources for the signal efficiencies as summarized in table  [ tab : sigaccsys ] ( right ) .",
    "systematic uncertainties for the background estimation are already included in tables  [ tab : cdfvsbg ] and [ tab : cdfvsbg_2d ] , which include uncertainties of residual photon - conversion estimation , fake - lepton estimation , and mc scale factors for the mc - based background estimations .",
    "we find the expected number of backgrounds is 3.23 @xmath10 0.69 events , while we observed 3 events in the data . from these results",
    ", we set the 95@xmath12 c.l .",

    "table  [ tab : limit ] shows the limit for each higgs mass point from 110 gev/@xmath8 to 200 gev/@xmath8 .",
    "we also obtain the ratios of the limit to the standard model cross sections and to the fermiophobic higgs cross sections ( assuming the standard model production cross sections ) with taking into account of uncertainties of these theoretical predictions in the limit calculations , which are shown in table  [ tab : limr ] .",
    "we searched for the neutral higgs production associated with the @xmath0 boson using high-@xmath1 like - sign dilepton events with the data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.9 @xmath4 .",
    "we did not see any significant disagreements between background expectations and the data . given this",
    ", we tuned the final cut on the 2nd lepton @xmath1 and the @xmath1 of dilepton system in order to obtain the limit - best result .",
    "we found that the 2nd lepton @xmath1 cut of 20 gev/@xmath31 and the dilepton - system @xmath1 cut of 15 gev/@xmath31 was a reasonable choice . with this final cut",
    ", we obtained the expected number of fermiophobic higgs events for the mass 110 gev/@xmath8 to be 0.46 assuming the standard model production cross section and 0.19 for the 160 gev/@xmath8 higgs .",
