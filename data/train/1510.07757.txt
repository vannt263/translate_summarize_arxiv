    "the analysis of the spectra of h@xmath0ii regions provides information about the chemical composition of the present - day interstellar medium in different kinds of star - forming galaxies and in different regions across these galaxies . the results supply fundamental input for our models of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "oxygen , the third most abundant element , is taken as representative of the metallicity of the medium , since the oxygen abundance is the one most easily derived from the optical spectra of photoionized gas .",
    "leaving aside the construction of photoionization models that reproduce the spectra , there are different ways to derive oxygen abundances from the observed spectra .",
    "when the spectra are deep enough to allow the measurement of the weak lines needed for the determination of electron temperatures , such as [ o@xmath0iii ]  @xmath7 or [ n@xmath0ii ]  @xmath8 , we can use the direct method to derive the o@xmath9 and o@xmath10 abundances , and obtain the total oxygen abundance by adding these ionic abundances . on the other hand , when the temperature - sensitive lines are not detected , one must resort to alternative methods that are based on the intensities of the strongest lines , the so - called strong - line methods .",
    "these methods are calibrated using grids of photoionization models or samples of h@xmath0ii regions that have estimates of the electron temperature ( the empirical methods ) .",
    "the strongest lines in the optical spectra of h@xmath0ii regions that are usually used by strong - line methods are [ o@xmath0ii ]  @xmath11 , [ o@xmath0iii ]  @xmath12 , [ n@xmath0ii ]  @xmath13 , [ s@xmath0ii ]  @xmath14 , h@xmath15 , and h@xmath16 .",
    "different methods use different combinations of line ratios involving these lines and , although a large variety of methods are available , it is important to consider the procedures that have been used to calibrate them , and whether the samples of observed objects or photoionization models used for the calibration cover the same physical properties as the h@xmath0ii regions to which the method will be applied @xcite . in general , different methods and different calibrations of the same method will lead to different results .",
    "it is not easy to construct grids of photoionization models that reproduce well enough the main characteristics of the observed h@xmath0ii regions so that they can be used to calibrate the strong - line methods @xcite .",
    "this might explain the fact that the abundances derived with methods based on this type of calibration differ from those derived with empirical methods @xcite . as an example of the complications that arise",
    "when defining the input parameters of photoionization models , we do not have much information about the properties of dust grains inside h@xmath0ii regions ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and they have important effects on the emitted spectrum @xcite , especially at high metallicities .",
    "empirical methods also have their problems : it is difficult to measure the lines needed for temperature determinations in metal - rich regions , the electron temperatures estimated for these regions can introduce important biases in the abundance determinations @xcite , and if , as suggested by several authors , there are temperature fluctuations in h@xmath0ii regions which are larger than those predicted by photoionization models , they can lead to lower abundances than the real ones at any metallicity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if one excludes from the samples high - metallicity objects , and if temperature fluctuations turn out to be not much higher than the ones expected from photoionization models , it can be argued that empirical calibrations of the strong - line methods should be preferred because they are based on a lower number or assumptions , although photoionization models can provide much insight on the explanations behind the behaviour and applicability of the strong - line methods .",
    "one important question is how well strong - line methods can be expected to do .",
    "grids of photoionization models can be used to show that strong - line methods work because the metallicity of most h@xmath0ii regions is strongly related to the effective temperature of the ionizing radiation and to the ionization parameter of the region@xcite .",
    "this implies that strong - line methods will not work properly when applied to regions that do not follow this general relation due to variations in their star formation histories , ages , or chemical evolution histories @xcite .",
    "the direct method is expected to work better since it is based on a smaller number of assumptions , and when observations of h@xmath0ii regions are presented in any publication , it is usually described as an achievement to detect the weak lines that allow a temperature determination .",
    "however , the measurement of the weak , temperature - sensitive , lines can be affected by large uncertainties when these lines have a low signal - to - noise ratio in the nebular spectrum . when the oxygen abundances are derived with the direct method using temperature estimates based on these lines , the results will also have large uncertainties .",
    "the calibration of strong - line methods using these oxygen abundances can be affected by the large uncertainties , but this problem can be alleviated by a careful selection of calibration samples trying to have small , randomly distributed , uncertainties , and by cleaning up the samples excluding the outliers , since it can be assumed that they depart from the relation implied by the rest of the sample either because they have different properties or because their line intensities have large uncertainties . in principle",
    "the average behaviour of these samples could allow good calibrations of strong - line methods which might then show lower dispersions than the results of the direct method when applied to objects in the calibration sample or to objects that have the average properties of the calibration sample .",
    "in these cases , strong - line methods will be more robust than the direct method .",
    "the measurement of the intensities of the strong lines used by the strong - line methods should present less problems . however , there are observational effects that introduce uncertainties in all the measurements of line intensity ratios , effects that are not necessarily included in the estimated uncertainties , namely , atmospheric differential refraction leading to the measurement of different lines at different spatial positions , the incorrect extraction of 1d spectra from tilted 2d spectra , undetected absorption features beneath the emission lines , problems with the estimation of the continuum or with deblending procedures , the presence of unnoticed cosmic rays , or any bias introduced by the flux calibration or the extinction correction",
    ". some of the line ratios used by strong - line methods will be more sensitive to these effects , making these methods less robust than others that are based on less - sensitive line ratios .",
    "moreover , since the line ratios used as temperature diagnostics can be very sensitive to these observational problems , the results of the direct method might be less robust than those derived with strong - line methods even when the weak temperature - sensitive lines are measured with a good signal - to - noise ratio .    one way to infer",
    "the robustness of the methods used for abundance determinations in the presence of observational problems is to compare their performance when they are used to estimate metallicity gradients in galaxies .",
    "the observational problems are likely to introduce dispersions around an existing gradient that can be interpreted as azimuthal abundance variations .",
    "if any of the methods implies significantly lower dispersions , it seems reasonable to assume that azimuthal variations must be lower than the estimated dispersions , and hence that the method is behaving in a more robust way . since spectra obtained by different authors are likely to be affected by various observational problems in different amounts , the robustness of each method to observational effects can be inferred from the dispersions around the gradient implied by the method when using spectra observed by different authors in the same galaxy .",
    "methods that show significantly lower dispersions can then be inferred to be more robust .",
    "here we present an analysis of the oxygen abundance gradient in m81 , using this galaxy as a case study of the robustness of some of the methods used for abundance determinations in h@xmath0ii regions .",
    "we will explore the behaviour of methods that have been calibrated using large samples of h@xmath0ii regions that have temperature determinations .",
    "m81 is an ideal candidate for this study , since it is a nearby spiral galaxy , at a distance of 3.63@xmath170.34 mpc  @xcite .",
    "this galaxy belongs to an interacting group of galaxies and has well - defined spiral arms that contain a large number of h@xmath0ii regions .",
    "the oxygen abundance gradient of m81 has been calculated in different studies using several methods ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these works find slopes that go from @xmath18 to @xmath19 dex kpc@xmath3 , and some of them include h@xmath0ii regions where it is possible to measure the electron temperature and calculate the metallicity with the direct method .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section  2 we describe our observations , which were obtained with the gran telescopio canarias ( gtc ) , the data reduction , the sample selection , the measurement of the line intensities , and the reddening corrections ; in section  3 we describe the methods we apply to calculate the physical conditions and chemical abundances of the sample of h@xmath0ii regions ; in section 4 we present the results of this analysis , and the implied metallicity gradients , using our data and other observations from the literature ; in section 5 we discuss the scatter around the metallicity gradient implied by the different methods ; and finally , in section  6 , we summarize our results and present our conclusions .",
    "spectroscopic observations ( programme gtc11 - 10amex , pi : drg ) were carried out using the long - slit spectrograph of the osiris instrument at the 10.4-m gtc telescope in the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( la palma , spain ) .",
    "we used the five slit positions listed in table  [ slits ] , with a slit width of 1 arcsec and length of 8 arcmin .",
    "table  [ slits ] provides the central positions of the slits , the exposure times we used , the slit position angles ( p.a . ) , and the airmasses during the observations .",
    "we obtained three exposures of 900 s at each slit position using the r1000b grism , which allowed us to cover the spectral range 36307500   with a spectral resolution of @xmath20   full width at half - maximun .",
    "the observations were acquired on 2010 april 57 when the seeing was @xmath21 arcsec .",
    "the detector binning by 2 pixels in the spatial dimension provided a scale of 0.25 arcsec pixel@xmath3 .",
    "the airmasses were in the range 1.31.5 and , at these values , departures from the parallactic angle can introduce light losses at some wavelengths due to differential atmospheric refraction  @xcite . in our observations ,",
    "the differences between the position angle and the parallactic angle go from 8 to 23 degrees .",
    "although small , the differences imply that we might be losing some light in the blue , especially for the few objects with sizes around 1 arcsec observed with slit positions p1 and p2 .",
    "this is one of the possible observational problems that we listed in section  [ intro ] , and the combined effects of these problems are explored in our analysis .    the data were reduced using the tasks available in the iraf software package .",
    "the reduction process included bias subtraction , flat - field and illumination correction , sky subtraction , wavelength calibration , and flux calibration using the standard star feige 34 . the final spectra result from the median of the three exposures obtained at each slit position .",

    "the question of whether a single straight - line fit describes well the metallicity gradient in a galaxy is often raised ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this does not concern us here .",
    "we have fitted straight lines in order to see the dependence of the slope on the method used for the abundance determination and to measure the dispersion of the results around these fits .",
    "we would get similar dispersions if we just measured the dispersion in abundances for regions located at similar galactocentric distances . besides , the low dispersions around the gradient shown by the abundances derived with the ons , c , and n2 methods suggest that straight - line fits are good first approximations to the data .    the main objective of this work is to study the effectiveness of the methods in producing robust measurements of abundance variations across a galaxy .",
    "one assumption we make is that the more robust methods will produce lower dispersions around the gradient . in the presence of azimuthal variations",
    ", we do not expect that any method will imply a dispersion lower than the real one .",
    "we think that this is a reasonable assumption .",
    "hence , we use the dispersions introduced by the different methods as a measure of their robustness or sensitivity to the observational data set used . note that the robustness of a method should not be confused with its reliability .",
    "the more robust methods will not necessarily provide better results .",
    "the reliability of the direct method depends on the validity of its assumptions ; the reliability of the strong - line methods depends on their calibration and on their application to objects that are well represented in the calibration samples . in what follows",
    ", we will centre our discussion in the robustness of the methods , and will assume that if a strong - line method does not provide a good estimate of the oxygen abundance , it is possible that it can be better calibrated to do so .    figs .",
    "[ sens ] and [ sens - n ] illustrate the sensitivity of each method to the main line ratios involved in the calculations .",
    "we plot in these figures the changes in the o / h , n / h , and n / o abundance ratios resulting from changes of 20 per cent in the main line intensity ratios involved in the calculations for all the regions in our sample . note that in these figures ` [ n@xmath0ii ] @xmath225755 ' identifies the results of changes in the [ n@xmath0ii ]  @xmath23 temperature diagnostic , ` [ n@xmath0ii ] ' identifies the results of changes in the [ n@xmath0ii ]  @xmath24h@xmath16 ratio for the ons method and the direct method , and the [ n@xmath0ii ]  @xmath25h@xmath16 ratio for the c , o3n2 and n2 methods .",

    "this makes this method vulnerable to different observational problems , especially the ones arising from the measurement of the intensity of the weak line [ n@xmath0ii ]  @xmath8 .",
    "the p method of @xcite shows an even larger sensitivity to changes in the line ratio [ o@xmath0ii ]  @xmath26h@xmath16 , making it vulnerable to problems introduced by atmospheric differential refraction and defective flux calibrations or extinction corrections .",
    "this is even more clear if we consider the dispersion from the gradient implied by this method when the regions where it has problems are included in the fit , 0.24 dex .",
    "it can be argued that these two line ratios , [ n@xmath0ii ]  @xmath23 and [ o@xmath0ii ]  @xmath26h@xmath16 , are the ones most likely to be affected by observational problems , making the direct method and the p method the least robust methods , in agreement with our results .",
    "in fact , the dispersions around the gradients listed in tables  [ results ] and [ results - nitrogen ] can be qualitatively understood in terms of the sensitivity of the methods to changes in these two line ratios , shown in figs .",
    "[ sens ] and [ sens - n ] .",
    "the results we obtain for n / o with the direct method , shown in fig .  [",
    "n - gradient]c , can be used to illustrate this effect , since the n / o abundances derived with this method depend mainly on the value of @xmath27 implied by the [ n@xmath0ii ]  @xmath23 intensity ratio and on the [ n@xmath0ii ]  @xmath24[o@xmath0ii ]  @xmath11 intensity ratio .",
    "our observed regions ( the diamonds in this figure ) have larger n / o ratios than most of the regions observed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the values we find for @xmath27([n@xmath0ii ] ) in our observed regions are generally higher than those we find for the regions of @xcite by an amount that can explain the differences in this abundance ratio . on the other hand , we find similar values of @xmath27([n@xmath0ii ] ) for our regions and the regions observed by @xcite . in this case the differences can be attributed to the large values of the [ o@xmath0ii ]  @xmath26h@xmath16 measured by @xcite in several regions , which are higher than the ones observed by us and by @xcite .",
    "if we compare the values of this line ratio for the regions that have temperature determinations and are located at galactocentric distances between 4 and 11 kpc , we find a range of values 149338 for our observed objects and 229327 for the regions observed by @xcite , whereas the regions observed by @xcite span a range of 180660 .",
    "this translates into an [ n@xmath0ii ] to [ o@xmath0ii ] line intensity ratio of 0.300.59 ( this work ) , 0.150.45 @xcite , and 0.160.29 @xcite .",
    "the high values of @xmath28 found by @xcite contribute in part to these differences , but they are already present in their observed intensities .    any work whose objective is the determination of abundances in h@xmath0ii regions considers an achievement the detection of the weak lines required for the calculation of electron temperature , since temperature - based abundances are expected to be more reliable than those based on strong - line methods .",
    "our results in fig .",
    "[ gradients ] and tables  [ results ] and [ comparison ] suggest otherwise .",
    "the abundances derived with the direct method are very sensitive to the assumed temperature , which in turn is sensitive to the line intensity ratio used for the diagnostic , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the precision required to get a good estimate of this ratio is often underestimated .",
    "the p method , based on the intensities of strong [ o@xmath0ii ] and [ o@xmath0iii ] lines relative to h@xmath16 , seems to be working slightly better in many cases , although there are regions whose abundances show large deviations from their expected values .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ sens ] suggest that the spectra of these regions might have problems related with atmospheric differential refraction , flux calibration or extinction correction . in this context",
    ", it would be useful to check whether the deviations are correlated with the airmass during the observation , but none of the papers whose spectra we use provides the airmass values of their observations .",
    "the new calibration of the p method of @xcite , which we have called p@xmath29 above , is less sensitive to the [ o@xmath0ii ]  @xmath26h@xmath16 line ratio and performs much better when used to derive the oxygen abundance gradient , implying a slope of @xmath5 dex kpc@xmath3 and a dispersion around the gradient of 0.09 dex .",
    "however , the calibration sample of the p@xmath29 method includes regions with abundances determined using the c method .",
    "since we have centred here on methods calibrated with h@xmath0ii regions that have temperature measurements , we only show the results of the p method in fig .",
    "[ gradients ] and table  [ results ] .    the other strong - line methods , especially the ons , c , and n2 methods , seem to be working remarkably well ( see the dispersions in table  [ results ] and fig .",
    "[ gradients ] ) .",
    "these methods suggest that azimuthal variations , if present , are very small .",
    "the low dispersion implied by the n2 method is especially remarkable , since it is due to a low dispersion in the values of the [ n@xmath0ii ]  @xmath30h@xmath15 intensity ratio that can only arise if n / h and the degree of ionization are both varying smoothly across the disc of m81 . since these quantities and",
    "n / o might show different variations in other environments , the n2 method will not necessarily give consistent results for o / h when applied to h@xmath0ii regions in other galaxies or to regions located near galactic centres .",
    "in fact , @xcite find that the n2 method can lead to values of o / h that differ from the ones derived with the direct method by up to an order of magnitude .",
    "the ons and c methods should be preferred for this reason , although we note that any strong - line method could easily fail for h@xmath0ii regions whose properties are not represented in the calibration sample @xcite .",
    "the best estimates of the chemical abundances in h@xmath0ii regions implied by forbidden lines will still be based on the measurement of electron temperatures , but we stress that they require data of high quality .",
    "this is illustrated by the work of @xcite , who found that the scatter in the oxygen abundances derived with the direct method in the central part of the galaxy m33 is around 0.06 dex when using his observations , whereas the data of @xcite lead to much larger variations , with a dispersion of 0.21 dex .",
    "the spectra of @xcite were deeper than the ones observed by @xcite , which might explain this result , although there could be other effects involved in the explanation .",
    "another example of the low dispersion that can be found with the direct method is provided by @xcite for ngc  300 , where 28 h@xmath0ii regions covering a relatively large range of galactocentric distances show a dispersion around the gradient of only 0.05 dex .",
    "we have used long slit spectra obtained with the gtc telescope to extract spectra for 48 h@xmath0ii regions in the galaxy m81 .",
    "we have added to this sample the spectra of 68 h@xmath0ii regions in m81 observed by different authors @xcite .",
    "this sample was re - analysed using the line intensities reported in each work .",
    "we followed the same procedure that we applied in our sample to calculate physical properties , chemical abundances and galactocentric distances for these h@xmath0ii regions .",
    "the final sample contains 116 h@xmath0ii regions that cover a range of galactocentric distances of 333 kpc .",
    "we have used these data to derive the oxygen and nitrogen abundance gradients in m81 .",
    "we could calculate the electron temperature and apply the direct method to 31 h@xmath0ii regions of the sample .",
    "we used different strong - line methods to derive oxygen and nitrogen abundances for the full sample .",
    "we have chosen strong - line methods calibrated with large samples of h@xmath0ii regions with temperature - based abundance determinations : the p method of @xcite , the ons method of @xcite , the c method of @xcite , and the o3n2 and n2 methods calibrated by @xcite .",
    "we have fitted straight lines to the variation with galactocentric distance of the oxygen abundances implied by each method .",
    "we find metallicity gradients with slopes that go from @xmath1 to @xmath2 dex kpc@xmath3 .",
    "the two extreme values are derived with the p method and the direct method ( the shallower value ) .",
    "these two methods are the ones that are more sensitive to variations in two of the line ratios , most likely affected by observational problems , [ n@xmath0ii ]  @xmath23 and [ o@xmath0ii ]  @xmath26h@xmath16 , and show the largest dispersions around the gradient , 0.25 and 0.15 dex , respectively , whereas the ons , c , o3n2 , and n2 methods imply oxygen abundance gradients in the range from @xmath5 to @xmath6 dex kpc@xmath3 and very low dispersions , equal to 0.06 dex , for the c and n2 methods , 0.07 dex for the ons method , and 0.09 dex for the o3n2 method . since we are using observations from five different works , which are likely to be affected by diverse observational problems by differing amounts , we argue that this implies that the ons , c , and n2 methods are the more robust methods .",
    "our comparison of the results implied by the different methods for several of our objects that were also observed by other authors agree with this result .",
    "the low dispersions also imply that if there are azimuthal variations in the oxygen abundance in m81 , they must be small .    in the case of n / h",
    ", we have used the direct method , the c method , and the ons method , and find gradients of @xmath31 to @xmath19 dex kpc@xmath3 , with the direct method providing again the shallower slope and the largest dispersion around the fit , 0.18 dex , versus 0.15 dex for the ons method and 0.12 dex for the c method . for n / o",
    "we find slopes that go from @xmath32 to @xmath5 dex kpc@xmath3 , with the latter value derived with the direct method , although for this abundance ratio the dispersions are similar for the three methods , 0.110.13 dex .",
    "the dispersions around the gradients obtained with the different methods for o / h , n / h , and n / o can be qualitatively accounted for by considering the sensitivity of the methods to the two critical line ratios , [ n@xmath0ii ]  @xmath23 ( our main temperature diagnostic in this work ) and [ o@xmath0ii ]  @xmath26h@xmath16 .",
    "all the robust methods use the intensity of [ n@xmath0ii ]  @xmath33 , and the n2 method is only based on the intensity of this line with respect to h@xmath15 . since nitrogen and oxygen do not vary in lockstep because they are produced by different types of stars , and their relative abundances depend on the star formation history of the observed galactic region ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the low dispersions around the oxygen abundance gradient found with the robust methods suggest that both n / o and the degree of ionization vary smoothly along the disc of m81 . on the other hand ,",
    "the different values of n / o generally found for regions with similar oxygen abundances imply that strong - line methods that use the intensities of [ n@xmath0ii ] lines will produce different oxygen abundances in regions that have similar values of o / h but different values of n / o . the ons and c methods , that use line ratios involving several ions , and also estimate the n / h abundance ratio , can be expected to correct for this effect , at least for regions whose properties are well represented in their calibration samples , but the n2 method by itself can not achieve this correction . since our analysis indicates that the available observations do not allow reliable determinations of abundances through the direct method in this galaxy , and since we do not know if the more robust methods are working properly for the observed h@xmath0ii regions , the magnitude of the metallicity gradient in m81 remains uncertain .",
    "these issues should be further investigated using observations of h@xmath0ii regions in different environments that allow the determination of electron temperatures and n and o abundances through the direct method .",
    "the large dispersion in the abundances around the gradient that we find here when using the direct method implies that these observations should have high quality in order to get meaningful results . for the time being , we recommend the use of the ons or c methods when no temperature determinations are possible or when the available determinations are of poor quality .",

    "<S> we study the sensitivity of the methods available for abundance determinations in h@xmath0ii regions to potential observational problems . we compare the dispersions they introduce around the oxygen and nitrogen abundance gradients when applied to five different sets of spectra of h@xmath0ii regions in the galaxy m81 . </S>",
    "<S> our sample contains 116 h@xmath0ii regions with galactocentric distances of 3 to 33 kpc , including 48 regions observed by us with the osiris long - slit spectrograph at the 10.4-m gran telescopio canarias telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the direct method can be applied to 31 regions , where we can get estimates of the electron temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the different methods imply oxygen abundance gradients with slopes of @xmath1 to @xmath2  dex kpc@xmath3 , and dispersions in the range 0.060.25 dex . </S>",
    "<S> the direct method produces the shallowest slope and the largest dispersion , illustrating the difficulty of obtaining good estimates of the electron temperature . </S>",
    "<S> three of the strong - line methods , c , ons , and n2 , are remarkably robust , with dispersions of @xmath4 dex , and slopes in the range @xmath5 to @xmath6  dex kpc@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the robustness of each method can be directly related to its sensitivity to the line intensity ratios that are more difficult to measure properly . </S>",
    "<S> since the results of the n2 method depend strongly on the n / o abundance ratio and on the ionization parameter , we recommend the use of the c and ons methods when no temperature estimates are available or when they have poor quality , although the behaviour of these methods when confronted with regions that have different properties and different values of n / o should be explored .    </S>",
