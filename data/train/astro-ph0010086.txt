    "to understand a population properties it is crucial to disentangle the intrinsic features from the selection induced ones . to this aim",
    "it is necessary to compare the characteristics of sources selected in different spectral bands .",
    "we have therefore considered radio  loud quasars  which so far have been extracted from radio surveys  and studied an x  ray selected sample .",
    "we are mainly interested in determining whether the relation between the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and the source power proposed by ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and fossati et al .",
    "( 1998 )  a blazar sequence from high - peaked bl lacs ( hbl ) , to low - peaked bl lacs ( lbl ) to flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq )  holds also for fainter x - ray selected quasars .",
    "the trend in the sed can be physically accounted for by an increase in the external radiation field along the sequence .",
    "the sample under study comprises the radio  loud quasars detected in the _ einstein _ medium sensitivity survey ( emss ; gioia et al . 1990 ; stocke et al .",
    "it is the first statistically complete x  ray selected sample of ( 39 ) radio  loud quasars .",
    "details can be found in wolter & celotti ( 2000 , a&a submitted ) .",
    "the sample is cut at @xmath0 , and excludes narrow line objects .",
    "we dub the sample the emss radio loud quasar sample ( erl ) .",
    "we divide the sample in flat ( fs ) and steep ( ss ) spectrum radio  loud objects ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath2 is not bimodal and therefore the choice of a dividing value is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "we formally consider it at @xmath3=0.7 .",
    "we study the luminosities in the radio , optical and x  ray bands ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) and the corresponding broad band spectral indices ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) . through x ",
    "ray selection we detect objects with a rather limited range in optical luminosity , but a large span in the radio one , extending the range of sampled @xmath4 towards fainter sources compared to radio  selected quasars .",
    "the radio and x - ray luminosities seem to be correlated at the 99% level even taking into account the common redshift dependence .",
    "no differences are found between the distributions of fs and ss , neither in luminosities ( ks probability @xmath10 ) nor in broad band spectral indices ( @xmath11 ) nor in the trends , suggesting a behavior of the compact beamed component independent of the large scale radio flux dominance .",
    "the shape of the sed appears to be related to the radio luminosity : in fact , the only statistically significant trends found are between @xmath7 , @xmath9 and @xmath4 , consistent with being caused by a change in the synchrotron peak energy : the flatter is @xmath7 , the higher is the peak energy .    -0.1",

    "in fig . 1a we show the erl and samples of both fsrq and radio and x  ray selected bl lacs .",
    "the erl occupy the transition region ( in the `` boomerang '' shaped blazar distribution ) between fsrq and x  ray selected ( @xmath12 hbl ) bl lac objects , roughly overlapping with radio  selected ( @xmath12 lbl ) ones .",
    "note that the location of lbl and fsrq in the spectral index plane is due to the dominance in the x  ray band of a flat compton component .",
    "even the x  ray selection is unable to detect radio  loud quasars with high peaked synchrotron components , albeit sampling sources with @xmath13 comparable to that of hbl ( see fig .",
    "these findings are therefore in global agreement with the expectation of the blazars sequence scenario , thus re - enforcing the view of a strong connection between the sed and the radio luminosity .",
    "we propose that the concentration of erl in the lbl region could be at least in part ascribed to the increasing dominance of a quasi  thermal optically ",
    "uv component ( blue bump ) in quasars of increasingly lower ( non  thermal ) radio power .",
    "indeed the typical @xmath7 and @xmath9 of the low radio power erl corresponds to sed whose peak is located in the optical  uv region .",
    "the presence of such a component would flatten @xmath7 and steepen @xmath9 in sources with decreasing non  thermal continuum .",
    "optical and x  ray spectra will be able to verify such hypothesis .",
    "-0.8 cm        we plot the number counts of fs and ss sources in fig .",
    "2a . there is marginal evidence ( though over the whole range in flux ) for flatter counts of fs ( see table 1 . ) the count distributions of fs is in complete agreement with what found for all agn  mostly radio quiet in the emss ( @xmath14 , della ceca et al .",
    "1992 ) ; ss and all erl counts are marginally steeper ( at 1 @xmath15 level ) than all agn , possibly indicating larger amount of evolution .",
    "the most interesting aspect is the extension to a factor 100 lower fluxes provided by the x  ray selection . at radio fluxes of a few tens of mjy ( which corresponds for an average sed to @xmath16 ) the radio counts of x  ray selected objects are marginally consistent with the euclidean extrapolation from higher fluxes and thus largely exceed ( factor @xmath1710 for fs and @xmath123 for ss ) those predicted by the beaming model , which drop below @xmath12 0.1 jy ( padovani & urry 1992 ) . the emss bl lac distribution ( see fig .",
    "2a ) is flatter , dominating by a factor @xmath18 at @xmath19 , and an ` inversion ' of the two populations occurs just above @xmath123 @xmath20 .",
    "we have studied the cosmological evolution by applying the v@xmath21/v@xmath22 test ( avni & bachall , 1980 ) - see table 1 .",
    "the derived evolution rate for erl and fs is consistent with the total emss agn sample ( della ceca et al .",
    "ss require a slightly higher value for the evolution parameter .",
