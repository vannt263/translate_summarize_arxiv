    "consider an experiment in which alice can make one of several measurements on her part of a certain system and bob can make one of several measurements on his part of the system . each pair of measurements ( one by alice and one by bob ) leads to a pair of outcomes ( one for alice and one for bob ) .",
    "we keep track of the frequency distribution of the different pairs of outcomes that arise .",
    "this situation can be abstracted to an * empirical model * , which , for each pair of measurements , specifies a probability measure on pairs of outcomes .",
    "an associated * hidden - variable * ( henceforth * h.v . * )  * model * is obtained by starting with the empirical model and then appending to it extra variables that are assumed to be present in a more complete theory of how the data are generated .",
    "the uses of h.v .",
    "analysis include : ( i ) seeing if a deterministic account can be given of the observed data , and ( ii ) seeing if a common - cause account can be given of correlations in the observed data .",
    "perhaps , the best known context for h.v.analysis is quantum mechanics ( qm ) . starting with von neumann @xcite , and including , most famously , einstein , podolsky , and rosen @xcite , bell @xcite , and kochen and specker @xcite",
    ", a vast literature has grown up around the question of whether an h.v.formulation of qm is possible .",
    "the watershed no - go theorems of bell and kochen - specker give conditions under which the answer is no .",
    "h.v.s are variables above and beyond those which are part of the actual experiment , and are therefore unobserved .",
    "this poses a question : _ what can one assume about the structure of the space on which an h.v.lives?_ choosing a good empirical model includes choosing measurement and outcome spaces that incorporate appropriate physical features ( say , discreteness , connectedness , or other features ) .",
    "but , since it is unobserved , there is no such guide to choosing an h.v.space .",
    "this may or may not be a serious obstacle .",
    "the question often under study is whether or not an h.v.model exists that exhibits desired properties such as determinism or common - cause correlation . for a positive answer",
    ", we may be satisfied with showing that , at least for a certain choice of h.v.space , such a model exists .",
    "but , some of the most important results  including the bell and kochen - specker theorems  are negative answers , asserting that no h.v.model with certain properties exists . for a non - existence result to be definitive ,",
    "we need to search over all ( not just some ) h.v.spaces .",
    "our main result is that there is a * canonical h.v.model*. to be more specific , fix an empirical model .",
    "suppose there is an associated h.v.model that yields , for each pair of measurements , the same probability measure over joint outcomes .",
    "we will say that the h.v.model * realizes * the empirical model .",
    "we want to know if we can put this h.v.model into a canonical form .",
    "more than this , to be useful , such a canonical h.v.model must preserve properties  determinism , common - cause correlation , etc . ",
    "satisfied by the original h.v.model .",
    "we show that , under a measure - theoretic condition , such a canonical model exists : _ if the @xmath0-algebras on the measurement and outcome spaces are countably generated ( i.e. , the spaces are separable ) , then the h.v.space can always be taken to be the unit interval equipped with lebesgue measure .",
    "_ the key to our result is the classical theorem that any two countably generated atomless normalized measure algebras are isomorphic .",
    "this theorem can be found in carathodory @xcite and halmos and von neumann @xcite .",
    "it is also a special case of maharam s theorem @xcite .",
    "alice has a space of possible measurements , which is a measurable space @xmath1 , and a space of possible outcomes , which is a measurable space @xmath2 .",
    "likewise , bob has a space of possible measurements , which is a measurable space @xmath3 , and a space of possible outcomes , which is a measurable space @xmath4 .",
    "we will restrict attention to bipartite systems .",
    "( we comment later on the extension to more than two parts . )",
    "there is also an h.v.space , which is an unspecified measurable space @xmath5 .",
    "write @xmath6    an * empirical model * is a probability measure @xmath7 on @xmath8 .",

    "we use similar notation for ( finite ) products with factors to the left of @xmath32 or to the right of @xmath33 . note that if @xmath34 , then @xmath35=p[j||\\mathcal{z}]$ ] .",
    "we also use the analogous notation for expected values of random variables : given an integrable function @xmath21 , we write @xmath36 $ ] for the conditional expectation @xmath37 $ ] where @xmath38 is the projection from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
