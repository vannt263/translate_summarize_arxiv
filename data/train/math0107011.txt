    "we continue from @xcite the study of the cone @xmath8 , which is the set of triples of weakly decreasing @xmath9-tuples @xmath10 satisfying three conditions proved there to be equivalent :    1 .",
    "regarding @xmath1 as spectra of @xmath11 hermitian matrices , there exist three hermitian matrices with those spectra whose sum is the zero matrix ; 2 .",
    "( if @xmath1 are integral ) regarding @xmath1 as dominant weights of @xmath2 , the tensor product @xmath12 of the corresponding irreducible representations has an invariant vector ; 3 .   regarding @xmath1 as possible boundary data on a honeycomb ,",
    "there exist ways to complete it to a honeycomb .    in the present paper",
    "we determine the minimal set of inequalities defining this cone , along the way giving new proofs of the results in @xcite which gave a sufficient list of inequalities in terms of schubert calculus on grassmannians .",
    "we show that this list is in fact minimal ( establishing the converse of the result in @xcite ) . as in @xcite , our approach to this cone",
    "is in the honeycomb formulation .",
    "we also replace the use of schubert calculus by _ puzzles _ , defined below .",
    "most prior work was stated in terms of the sum - of - hermitian matrices problem .",
    "that was first proved to give a polyhedral cone in @xcite .",
    "many necessary inequalities were found ( see @xcite for a survey ) , culminating in the list of totaro @xcite , helmke - rosenthal @xcite , and klyachko @xcite ",
    "hereafter we call this the h - r / t / k result .",
    "klyachko proved also that this list is sufficient .",
    "a recursively defined list of inequalities had been already conjectured in @xcite ; this conjecture is true , and in fact gives the same list as klyachko s  see @xcite .",
    "one of us ( cw ) observed that this list is redundant  some of the inequalities given do not determine facets but only lower - dimensional faces of @xmath8  and proposed a criterion for shortening the list ( again in terms of schubert calculus ) .",
    "that this shorter list is already sufficient was proved by belkale @xcite .",
    "our primary impetus for the present work was to prove the converse : each of these inequalities is essential , i.e. determines a facet of @xmath8 .",
    "a puzzle will be a certain kind of diagram in the triangular lattice in the plane .",
    "there are three * * puzzle pieces :    1 .",
    "unit equilateral triangles with all edges labeled @xmath13 2 .   unit equilateral triangles with all edges labeled @xmath14 3 .",
    "unit rhombi ( two equilateral triangles joined together ) with the outer edges labeled @xmath14 if clockwise of an obtuse angle , @xmath13 if clockwise of an acute angle .    a * * puzzle of size @xmath15 is a decomposition of a lattice triangle of side - length @xmath9 into lattice polygons , all edges labeled @xmath13 or @xmath14 , such that each region is a puzzle piece .",
    "some examples are in figure [ fig : puzex ] .",
    "the main result about these puzzles ( theorem [ thm : puzcount ] , stated below , proved in section [ sec : puzresults ] ) is that they compute schubert calculus on grassmannians . while there are many other rules for such computations , e.g. the littlewood - richardson rule , this one has the greatest number of manifest symmetries .",
    "( a lengthy discussion of this will appear in @xcite . )",
    "readers only interested in a solution to the hermitian sum problem can skip the statement of this theorem and , in fact , quit after section [ sec : gentle ] .",
    "a central principle in the current paper is that in determining the facets of @xmath8 , the connection to schubert calculus is quite irrelevant , and it is more natural combinatorially to work with the puzzles directly , which we do until section [ sec : puzresults ] .",
    "this nicely complements the principle of @xcite , in which we worked not with triples of hermitian matrices but used honeycombs as their combinatorial replacement .",
    "we will not in general take space to repeat the honeycomb - related definitions from @xcite .",
    "we fix first our conventions to describe `` schubert calculus , '' which in modern terms is the ring structure on the cohomology of grassmannians . to an @xmath9-tuple @xmath16 like @xmath17 of @xmath18 ones and @xmath19 zeroes ,",

    "alternately , @xmath22 is the closure of the set of @xmath18-subspaces @xmath26 such that @xmath27 $ ] . the * * schubert class @xmath28 is the poincar dual of this cycle",
    ". these are well - known to give a basis for the cohomology ring .",
    "[ thm : puzcount ] let @xmath29 be three @xmath9-tuples of @xmath18 ones and @xmath19 zeroes , indexing schubert classes @xmath30 in @xmath31 .",
    "then the following ( equivalent ) statements hold :    1 .",
    "the intersection number @xmath32 is equal to the number of puzzles whose nw boundary edges are labeled @xmath33 , ne are labeled @xmath34 , and s are labeled @xmath16 , all read clockwise .",
    "@xmath35 where the sum is taken over puzzles with nw side labeled @xmath33 , ne side labeled @xmath34 , both from left to right .",
    "this first is the advertised @xmath36-invariant formulation .",
    "the second formulation is very suitable for computations ; an example is in figure [ fig : prodex ] .",
    "puzzles have another symmetry , which we call * * puzzle duality : the * * dualization of a puzzle is defined to be the left - right mirror reflection , with all @xmath13s exchanged for @xmath14s and vice versa .",
    "this realizes combinatorially another symmetry of schubert calculus , coming from the isomorphism of the @xmath18-grassmannian in an @xmath9-dimensional space @xmath37 with the @xmath38-grassmannian in @xmath39 .",
    "we will use puzzle duality to reduce the number of cases considered in some arguments .      in sections",
    "[ sec : hr]-[sec : gentle ] we classify the facets of @xmath8 in terms of puzzles . in sections [ sec : puzresults]-[sec : schub ] we prove and make use of the connection of puzzles to schubert calculus . to emphasize again : the reader who is only looking for the minimal list of inequalities determining @xmath8 may completely ignore this connection , and take puzzles as the more relevant concept than schubert calculus !    here is a slightly more detailed breakdown of the paper . in section [ sec : hr ]",
    "we prove the puzzle - theoretic analogue of the h - r / t / k result : each puzzle gives an inequality on @xmath8 .    in section [ sec : tco ]",
    "we essentially repeat horn s analysis of the facets of @xmath8 , but in the honeycomb framework ; the analogues of his direct sums turn out to be _ clockwise overlays_. using these we prove the puzzle - theoretic analogue of klyachko s sufficiency result ( a converse of h - r / t / k ) : every facet comes from a puzzle .",
    "easy properties of puzzles ( from section [ sec : puzresults ] ) then imply horn s results ( but not his conjecture ) .    in section [ sec :",
    "gentle ] we study `` gentle loops '' in puzzles , and show that the minimal list of inequalities is given by puzzles with no gentle loops .",
    "then comes the only particularly technical part of the paper : showing that puzzles without gentle loops are exactly the _ rigid _ ones , meaning those determined by their boundary conditions . that the rigid - puzzle inequalities are a sufficient list is the puzzle analogue of belkale s result @xcite ; conversely , that every rigid - puzzle inequality determines a facet , is the central new result of this paper .    in section [ sec : puzresults ]",
    "we describe the connection of puzzles to schubert calculus , and in section [ sec : schub ] give puzzle - free statements of our theorems .",
    "this section also serves as a summary of the old and new results in this paper .",
    "since schubert calculus is itself related to the tensor product problem ( in a lower dimension ) , this gives a combinatorial way to understand the still - mysterious horn recursion .",
    "we also give an application of the no - gentle - loop characterization of rigid puzzles to prove an unpublished conjecture of w. fulton .    in the last section we state the corresponding results for sums of @xmath40 hermitian matrices .",
    "the proofs extend almost without change to the @xmath41 case . in an appendix",
    "we give a quick proof of the equivalence between the three definitions of @xmath8 , replacing klyachko s argument by the kirwan / kempf - ness theorem , which allows for rather stronger results .",
    "since completing this work , we received the preprint @xcite , which studies representations of general quivers ; our results can be seen as concerning the very special case of the `` triple flag quiver '' . assuming fulton s conjecture as input ( see conjecture 30 of @xcite ) ,",
    "their results provide a ( completely different ) proof of the converse of belkale s result .",
    "we have been unable to find any generalization of our honeycomb and puzzle machinery to general quivers .",
    "we are most grateful to anda degeratu for suggesting the name `` puzzle '' , and the referee for many useful comments .",
    "the once - itinerant first author would like to thank rutgers , ucla , msri , and especially dave ben - zvi for their gracious hospitality while part of this work was being done .",
    "in this section we determine a list of inequalities satisfied by @xmath8 , which will eventually be seen to be the puzzle - theoretic version of the h - r / t / k result .",
    "recall from @xcite that @xmath8 is defined as the image of the `` constant coordinates of boundary edges '' map @xmath42 . in proposition 1 of @xcite",
    "we showed that the nondegenerate honeycombs ( those whose edges are all multiplicity 1 and vertices all trivalent ) are dense in @xmath43 .",
    "so in determining inequalities on @xmath8 one can safely restrict to boundaries of nondegenerate honeycombs .",
    "this reduction is not logically necessary for the rest of the section but may make it easier to visualize .",
    "let @xmath44 be a nondegenerate @xmath9-honeycomb , and let @xmath33 be a lattice equilateral triangle of side - length @xmath9 .",
    "there is an obvious correspondence between @xmath44 s vertices and the unit triangles in @xmath33 , as in figure [ fig : puzcor ] .",
    "more importantly for us , one can also correspond the bounded edges of @xmath44 ( connecting two vertices ) and the unit rhombi in @xmath33 ( the union of two triangles ) . finally , the semiinfinite edges in @xmath44 correspond to the boundary edges of @xmath33 ( to which they are perpendicular ) .    given a puzzle @xmath45 of side - length @xmath9 ,",
    "define a linear functional @xmath46 by @xmath47 ( this does not really use @xmath44 nondegenerate  in the degenerate case , some of these terms are @xmath13 . ) note that this functional is automatically nonnegative , as it is a sum of nonnegative terms .",
    "we define `` length '' relative to the triangular lattice , i.e. @xmath48 of the usual euclidean length .",
    "as defined above , the quantity @xmath49 seems to depend on the internal structure of @xmath45 and @xmath44 .",
    "however , there is a `` green s theorem '' which allows us to write @xmath49 purely in terms of the boundary labels on @xmath45 and @xmath44 :    [ thm : hrpuz ] let @xmath45 be an @xmath9-puzzle , and @xmath50 the corresponding functional on @xmath43",
    ". then @xmath51 and in particular descends to give a nonnegative functional on @xmath8 .",
    "put another way , the inequality @xmath52 is satisfied by @xmath8 .",
    "we compute what at first seems to be a different functional , in two different ways .",
    "call an edge on a puzzle piece * * right - side - up if its outward normal is parallel to an outward normal of the entire puzzle , * * upside - down if the outward normal is antiparallel .",
    "so on a right - side - up triangle , all three edges are right - side - up , and vice versa for an upside - down triangle . whereas on a rhombus , two of the edges are right - side - up , two upside - down .",
    "define the functional @xmath53 by @xmath54 where the sign is @xmath55 if @xmath56 right - side - up , @xmath57 if @xmath56 upside - down .",
    "we claim first that @xmath58 .",
    "consider the contribution a piece @xmath59 makes to the sum in @xmath60 : a @xmath61-triangle contributes nothing , a @xmath62-triangle contributes the three coordinates of a vertex ( which sum to zero ) , and we leave the reader to confirm that a rhombus contributes the length of the corresponding edge in @xmath44 .    to show that @xmath60 also matches the conclusion of the theorem , rewrite by switching the order of summation : @xmath63 @xmath64 for every edge @xmath56 internal to the puzzle , this latter sum is @xmath65 which cancels , whereas for every exterior @xmath13-edge it is @xmath14 .",
    "the claim follows .    and",
    "as stated before , this functional is a sum of honeycomb edge - lengths , so automatically nonnegative on @xmath43 .",
    "( as we will review in subsection [ ss : horn ] , these inequalities @xmath66 are automatically of the sort that horn predicted in @xcite  a sum of @xmath18 distinct elements from each of @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 . ) in figure [ fig : ineqex ] we repeat the puzzles from figure [ fig : puzex ] and give the corresponding inequalities .",
    "since the sum of _ all _ the boundary coordinates is zero , this inequality can be restated as coming from a nonpositive functional , @xmath70 as it does in some of the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) .    this theorem [ thm : hrpuz ] will in section",
    "[ sec : schub ] be seen to be the puzzle analogue of the necessary conditions of h - r / t / k . in the next section",
    "we show that every facet ( except for some easy , uninteresting ones ) does indeed come from a puzzle inequality @xmath66 , which will be the puzzle - theoretic analogue of klyachko s sufficiency theorem ( a converse of h - r / t / k ) .",
    "in this section we study the honeycombs that lie over facets of @xmath8 .",
    "we begin by recalling horn s results @xcite on triples of hermitian matrices which sum to zero , to help make intuitive the corresponding results we will find on honeycombs .",
    "horn considered the function `` take eigenvalues in decreasing order '' from zero - sum hermitian triples to @xmath71 . by definition , the image satisfies the * * chamber inequalities , i.e. that @xmath72 ( similarly @xmath73 ) .",
    "the remaining facets we call * * regular facets",
    ".    away from the chamber walls , the `` take eigenvalues '' map is differentiable , and one can use calculus to find its extrema : horn did this , and found that the critical points occur exactly when the zero - sum hermitian triple is a direct sum of two smaller ones .",
    "( this is nowadays a standard calculation in hamiltonian geometry ",
    "see @xcite for an exposition of this viewpoint . )",
    "since that implies that the traces of each subtriple sum to zero , one sees that the equation of the facet so determined says that the sum of a certain @xmath18 eigenvalues from @xmath67 , another @xmath18 from @xmath68 , and another @xmath18 from @xmath69 add to zero .    also , the hessian is definite at an extremal point , which gives another condition on these three @xmath18-element subsets @xmath74 of @xmath75 .",
    "define an * * inversion of such a subset @xmath76 as a pair @xmath77 such that @xmath78",
    ". then horn shows that definiteness of the hessian implies that the total number of inversions , over the three subsets @xmath79 is @xmath80 .",
    "( both of these conditions are automatic for puzzles , as shown later in proposition [ prop : puzstructure ] ; in particular this will give combinatorial proofs of horn s results . )",
    "we now undertake the same extremal analysis on honeycombs , rather than zero - sum hermitian triples .",
    "we will need the following lemma , whose proof is immediate , to recognize inequalities from individual boundary points . recall that a * * facet of a polyhedron is a codimension-1 face .",
    "[ lem : bdry ] let @xmath45 be a polyhedron ( convex , but not necessarily compact ) , @xmath59 a point on a facet @xmath81 of @xmath45 , and @xmath82 a nonzero affine - linear function vanishing at @xmath59 .",
    "if @xmath81 contains a neighborhood of @xmath59 in @xmath83 , then @xmath59 is an interior point of @xmath81 , the equation of @xmath81 is @xmath84 , and the inequality determining @xmath81 is either @xmath85 or @xmath86 .    to apply this to @xmath8 , we will need to know its dimension ; via the hermitian picture , this is well known to be @xmath87 ( it is cut down from @xmath88 by the fact that the sum of the traces must be zero ) .",
    "we give a honeycomb - theoretic proof in proposition [ prop : lrndim ] , mainly in order to introduce the construction by which we will vary the boundary of a honeycomb .",
    "define the * * natural sign of an oriented edge in a honeycomb to be @xmath55 if the edge points northwest , northeast , or south and @xmath57 if it points north , southwest , or southeast .",
    "( by these six compass directions we of course really mean directions that are at @xmath89 angles from one another , not @xmath90 and @xmath91 . )",
    "observe that a path in a nondegenerate honeycomb must alternate natural sign ( orienting the edges to follow the path ) .",
    "in particular , a path coming in from infinity on one boundary edge ( natural sign @xmath57 ) and going out on another ( natural sign @xmath55 ) must be of odd length .",
    "[ prop : lrndim ] the cone @xmath8 is @xmath92-dimensional .",
    "this is certainly an upper bound : by lemma 1 of @xcite , the sum of all the constant coordinates of boundary edges is zero .",
    "let @xmath44 be a nondegenerate honeycomb , @xmath93 a ( possibly negative ) real number such that @xmath94 is smaller than the length of any of @xmath44 s edges , and @xmath95 two boundary edges .",
    "then there exists a path @xmath96 in the honeycomb tinkertoy @xmath97 connecting @xmath56 and @xmath82 ( which we can ask be non - self - intersecting ) .",
    "we can add @xmath93 times the natural sign to the constant coordinates of @xmath44 s edges along @xmath96 and get a new honeycomb .",
    "this changes @xmath56 s coordinate by @xmath98 , and @xmath82 s by @xmath99 . by repeating this with other pairs",
    ", we can achieve arbitrary small perturbations of the boundary coordinates , subject to the sum staying zero .",
    "so @xmath8 contains a @xmath92-dimensional neighborhood of @xmath100 .",
    "call the construction in proposition [ prop : lrndim ] the * * trading construction .",
    "we will need it not only for the honeycomb tinkertoy @xmath97 , but ( connected ) tinkertoys constructed from @xmath97 by eliding simple degeneracies , as we did in the corollary to theorem 1 of @xcite .",
    "in particular if @xmath44 is a simply degenerate honeycomb , and @xmath97 stays connected after eliding @xmath44 s simple degeneracies , then @xmath100 is in the interior of @xmath8 .",
    "recall the overlay operation from @xcite ; it makes an @xmath9-honeycomb @xmath101 from an @xmath38-honeycomb @xmath102 and an @xmath18-honeycomb @xmath103 .",
    "if @xmath59 is a point common to @xmath102 and @xmath103 , call it a * * transverse point of intersection if it is a vertex of neither , and isolated in the intersection . call @xmath101 a * * transverse overlay if all intersection points are transverse . in this case",
    "every small perturbation of @xmath102 and @xmath103 is again a transverse overlay ; by proposition [ prop : lrndim ] this gives a @xmath104 dimensional family of boundaries .",

    "recall from @xcite that a simple degeneracy of a honeycomb is a vertex where two multiplicity - one edges cross in an x. we can deform a simple degeneracy to a pair of nondegenerate vertices connected by an edge .",

    "we first claim that @xmath114 is disconnected . for",

    "the the number of puzzles with @xmath204 on the nw and ne boundaries , and @xmath114 on the south boundary , all written left to right , is the structure constant @xmath205 .",
    "we prove the second statement : the first follows from the second , since @xmath206 is @xmath14 if @xmath33 is the reversal of @xmath114 , @xmath13 otherwise .",
    "the structure constants for multiplication of schubert classes are well known to also be the structure constants for tensor products of polynomial representations of @xmath2 ( the first to observe this seems to be ehresmann ; see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "the precise statement is as follows .",
    "let @xmath207 be the number of @xmath13s after the @xmath139th @xmath14 in @xmath33 , so @xmath208 , and @xmath67 is a partition of the number of inversions of @xmath33 .",

    "the honeycomb s vertices then come from the deflated @xmath14-regions , and the honeycomb s edges come from the deflated rhombus regions , with the multiplicity on the edge coming from the thickness of the original rhombus region .",
    "the resulting diagram obviously has finitely many vertices , all edges in triangular - coordinate directions , and semiinfinite edges only going nw / ne / s ( coming from the @xmath14-edges on the boundary of the original puzzle ) .",
    "the remaining condition for it to be the diagram of a honeycomb is that each vertex have zero total tension ; this is equivalent to the fact that the original @xmath14-region was a closed polygon .    to see that this is a bijection",

    "only half of these are manifest in the rule ; rotating the puzzles gives the even permutations of @xmath29 , and puzzle duality gives the composition of grassmann duality with the odd permutation @xmath220 .",
    "none of these are directly visible in the littlewood - richardson rule ( for a deeper discussion of this , see @xcite ) .",
    "this theorem makes possible a ( rather forced ) duality on honeycombs , as already observed in @xcite : pick a triangle containing the honeycomb , inflate to a puzzle , apply puzzle duality , and deflate back to a new honeycomb , the total effect being to exchange vertices for regions and vice versa .",
    "unfortunately this depends on the choice of triangle , and only works for integral honeycombs .",
    "this is quite different from the much more natural duality on honeycombs that comes from flipping them over , @xmath221 .",
    "\\3 . in @xcite",
    "we defined a way of locally modifying a honeycomb in the vicinity of a loop through nondegenerate vertices , which was also called breathing .",
    "it is easy to check that any breathing operation on honeycombs is , under the deflation correspondence above , the deflation of a gentle - loop breathing on a puzzle .",
    "( the reverse is not true : gentle - loop breathing of puzzles is a strict generalization . )",
    "note that this connection of puzzles and honeycombs is completely different from the one in theorem [ thm : klypuz ] , and serves as a combinatorial explanation of the recursive nature of horn s list of inequalities . to recapitulate",
    "the chain of reasoning involved : first one studies extremal @xmath9-honeycombs ( as we did in section [ sec : tco ] ) , and from an extremal honeycomb , which is necessarily an overlay of a @xmath18-honeycomb and an @xmath38-honeycomb , one constructs a puzzle encoding the pattern of overlay .",
    "that puzzle then deflates to a @xmath18-honeycomb , necessarily integral",
    ". therefore inequalities on @xmath9-honeycombs can be `` blamed '' on integral @xmath18-honeycombs .",
    "this is not recursive until one knows that honeycombs exist with given integral boundary conditions if and only if integral honeycombs exist with the same boundary ; this was ( the honeycomb version of ) the saturation conjecture , proved in @xcite .",
    "so far we have used puzzles to give inequalities on the boundaries of honeycombs . in this section",
    "we replace puzzles by schubert calculus , and honeycombs by zero - sum hermitian triples , to formulate puzzle- and honeycomb - free versions of most of our results .",
    "the only casualty is the characterization of rigid puzzles as those without gentle loops ; but this too has an application , in proving a conjecture of w. fulton .",
    "first we recall the connection of honeycombs to hermitian matrices : let @xmath10 be three weakly decreasing lists of real numbers .",
    "then there exists a honeycomb with boundary coordinates @xmath0 if and only if there exists a triple of hermitian matrices @xmath222 with spectra @xmath1 and adding to the zero matrix .",
    "this follows from @xcite and @xcite ; we make a more precise statement in the appendix , replacing klyachko s argument with more direct use of the relation between geometric invariant theory quotients and symplectic quotients .    avoiding direct mention of honeycombs and puzzles , we have    1 .",
    "@xcite if @xmath30 are three schubert classes on @xmath223 such that @xmath224 , then for any triple @xmath225 of @xmath11 hermitian matrices with zero sum and spectra @xmath1 ( written in decreasing order ) respectively , we have the inequality @xmath226 2 .",

    "5 .   if @xmath30 are three schubert classes on @xmath223 such that @xmath228 , then the corresponding h - r / t / k inequality is essential .",

    "if @xmath3 occurs exactly once as a constituent of @xmath231 , then @xmath232 , @xmath233 occurs exactly once as a constituent of @xmath7 .",
    "it is interesting to compare this to the saturation conjecture ( proven in @xcite ) .",
    "saturation says that if a polytope of honeycombs with fixed integral boundary is nonempty , the polytope contains at least one lattice honeycomb .",
    "the present conjecture is sort of a next step : its contrapositive says that if a polytope of honeycombs with fixed integral boundary is not only nonempty but positive - dimensional , the polytope contains at least _ two _ lattice honeycombs .",
    "we need one additional construction in order to prove this conjecture : the * * dual inflation of a puzzle by a factor @xmath234 , defined as dualizing the puzzle , @xmath234-inflating , then dualizing again .",
    "this amounts to thinking of the inflation of a puzzle in terms of the @xmath13-edges instead of the @xmath14-edges .",
    "let @xmath235 denote the high weight of the determinant representation , and @xmath236 denote the number of times @xmath3 appears in @xmath4 . then using the equality @xmath237 we can reduce to the case that @xmath67 and @xmath68 are nonnegative ( so , high weights of polynomial representations ) .",
    "therefore @xmath69 is also nonnegative , for otherwise @xmath238 would be zero for all @xmath5 .",
    "from there , we can use theorem [ thm : puzcount ] to convert to a schubert problem , i.e. counting puzzles rather than honeycombs .",
    "one then has to check that rescaling a honeycomb by the factor @xmath183 corresponds to dual - inflation on puzzles .    since the original honeycomb @xmath44 is rigid , so too is the corresponding puzzle @xmath45 , therefore by lemma [ lem : npuz ]",
    "so too is the dual inflation of @xmath45 by the factor @xmath183 , and therefore so is @xmath239 .",
    "define the @xmath240-inflation of a puzzle by @xmath183-inflating it , and then @xmath234-dual - inflating it ( these operations commute ) .",
    "note that this descends to a well - defined notion of the @xmath240-inflation of a _ boundary _ condition on a puzzle , and as such one can study the functions @xmath241 for fixed initial boundary conditions @xmath29 . because of the connections of puzzles to honeycombs and thereby to sections of a line bundle over @xmath242 ( see the appendix ) , one can show that @xmath243 is a polynomial function of one argument when the other is held fixed .",

    "the cone @xmath8 , whose facets we have now completely determined , has a generalization for any @xmath246 : the set of @xmath40-tuples of spectra @xmath247 such that there exist @xmath11 hermitian matrices with those spectra adding to the zero matrix .",
    "( again , this is equivalent to the corresponding @xmath40-fold tensor product problem . )",
    "then @xmath248 is just the cone @xmath8 we ve already determined , and @xmath249 are uninteresting .    to study this cone for @xmath250 by the techniques in @xcite and this paper , we need to determine the corresponding honeycomb extension problem .",
    "we do this by factoring the problem : sum the first @xmath251 matrices and call the eigenvalues of that @xmath68 , then see if @xmath68 goes with the last two spectra .",
    "@xmath252 ( here @xmath253 denotes @xmath254 , reversed so as to again be in decreasing order . ) repeat this factorization - connections on an @xmath40-punctured sphere with small holonomies around the punctures , this corresponds to taking a pants decomposition of the punctured surface . ] until everything is in terms of @xmath255 .",
    "then we can think of @xmath256 in terms of an @xmath257-tuple of honeycombs such that one boundary of each honeycomb anti - agrees with one boundary of the next .",
    "define an * * @xmath40-ary honeycomb as exactly such an @xmath257-tuple .",
    "graphically , the easiest way to think about these is to draw the honeycombs in the same plane , half of them upside down , and very far from one another , as in figure [ fig : multhoney ] . to get them far from one another",

    "tuple , because it does nt require one to choose this large - enough @xmath150 .",
    "if one insists on actually working with these single composite diagrams , one must use part 3 of lemma [ lem : blastradius ] bounding the size of a honeycomb in terms of two of its boundaries . ]",

    "all the same techniques developed for @xmath259 go through without change .",
    "define an * * @xmath40-ary puzzle as an @xmath257-tuple of puzzles ( every other one upside down ) that can be fitted together into a line , and call the individual puzzles the * * constituents of the @xmath40-ary puzzle .",
    "( careful : these are not merely arrangements of puzzle pieces into a trapezoid / parallelogram ; they satisfy the extra condition that no rhombus is allowed to cross from one constituent into the next . ) on the schubert calculus side , these count intersections of @xmath40 cycles in a grassmannian . in figure [ fig:4linestouch2 ]",
    "we give the famous count ( two ) of the number of lines touching four others in @xmath260 .",
    "a * * gentle path in an @xmath40-ary puzzle has essentially the same definition , with the only tricky point that it can not include one of the edges joining one constituent puzzle to the next . with these definitions we have the analogous results",
    ":    each @xmath40-ary puzzle gives a nonnegative functional on @xmath256 .",
    "the regular facets of @xmath256 come precisely from the @xmath40-ary puzzles with no gentle loops .",
    "these @xmath40-ary puzzles are exactly the rigid ones , corresponding to @xmath40 grassmannian schubert cycles intersecting in a unique point .",
    "all the proofs go through without modification , except for one : we need to check that when we breathe a gentle loop in an @xmath40-ary puzzle using the loop - breathing lemma [ lem : loopbreathing ] , we do nt introduce any rhombi that cross from one constituent puzzle to the next , for that would remove a boundary edge from a puzzle .",
    "but the edges separating constituents are obviously on normal lines to the gentle path , and the loop - breathing construction does not remove these edges .      in figure [ fig:4linestouch2 ] we exhibited two @xmath261-ary puzzles with the same boundary .",
    "by our theorems , we know that these have gentle loops , and determine the same true inequality @xmath262 on spectra of four hermitian matrices with zero sum , but that this inequality is inessential .",
    "all the arguments in this paper study @xmath8 purely in terms of its interpretation as the possible boundary conditions of honeycombs . in @xcite , these are related to invariants in tensor products of @xmath2-representations , which are turn related to hermitian matrices in @xcite .    we include here a stronger result ( which could already have been given in @xcite ) , replacing klyachko s argument by the kirwan / kempf - ness theorem , allowing for a more precise result .",
    "while this involves some somewhat formidable machinery , its application really is a routine matter , and so we label the following a corollary .",

    "the volume ( resp . real dimension ) of the polytope of honeycombs in @xmath263 with boundary coordinates @xmath0 is equal to the symplectic volume ( resp .",
    "complex dimension ) of the space of zero - sum hermitian triples with these spectra modulo the diagonal action of @xmath264 . in particular",
    ", there exists such a honeycomb if and only if there exists such a zero - sum hermitian triple .",
    "the machinery used here is geometric invariant theory , particularly the `` geometric invariant theory quotients are symplectic quotients '' theorem @xcite . to begin with ,",

    "it is symplectomorphic to the product of the @xmath264 coadjoint orbits through @xmath267 @xmath268 and @xmath69 .",
