    "the measurement of the top - quark pair production cross section provides an important test of perturbative qcd calculations and top - quark pair production constitutes a major background source to many new physics scenarios predicted to be accessible at the lhc .",
    "the @xmath0 production cross section is nowadays calculated at approximate nnlo and is @xmath4  pb for a top - quark mass of 172.5  gev at a centre - of - mass energy of @xmath2  tev @xcite .    in the fully hadronic final state , the two @xmath5 s decay hadronically and the experimental signature is characterized by a nominal six - jet topology with two jets stemming from the hadronization of @xmath3-quarks .",
    "the all - hadronic channel has the advantage of a large branching ratio , 46% , although it suffers from a huge background of multi - jet events .",
    "the present result @xcite is based on data recorded during the 2011 run with @xmath6 collisions at @xmath2  tev using the atlas detector @xcite .",
    "the total integrated luminosity is 4.7  fb@xmath1 with an uncertainty of 3.9@xmath7 after asking for stable beam conditions and all subsystems to be operational .",
    "this analysis is complementary to similar measurements in the single lepton and dilepton channels .",
    "the events considered in this analysis are triggered asking for at least five jets with @xmath8 and @xmath9  gev .",
    "the calibration constants to correct for the lower hadron response of the non - compensating calorimeters were not included in the trigger system and an offline cut of @xmath10  gev is introduced at the analysis level to operate nearby the plateau of the trigger selection .",
    "the 55  gev cut is obtained by studying the trigger dependence on the fifth leading jet and corresponds to a 90@xmath7 efficiency with respect to jets reconstructed offline .",
    "the efficiency plateaus at more than 99@xmath7 starting from 60  gev and 55  gev represents the best compromise between signal acceptance and contribution to the trigger systematic uncertainty . to select a sample enriched in top - quark pair events ,",
    "a preliminary set of cuts is applied on the triggered events : at least one reconstructed primary vertex with at least five associated tracks , no isolated leptons with @xmath11  gev , at least five jets with @xmath10  gev and @xmath12 and at least one more jet with @xmath9  gev and @xmath12 .",
    "at least two jets , out of the five leading jets , are required to be @xmath3-tagged combining the high - performance algorithms @xcite in a neural network .",
    "jets with an unlikely association to the hard scatter in the event , using the jet vertex fraction information @xcite , are not considered in the analysis .",
    "the preselection is completed requiring a minimum angular distance between the two @xmath3-tagged jets of @xmath13 and a minimum angular distance between any two reconstructed jet of @xmath14 .",
    "the former cut reduces the background contamination from gluon splitting without compromising the signal efficiency while the latter cut is needed to avoid relying on the trigger simulation in case of close - by jets .",
    "the modelling of the @xmath0 signal and its associated selection efficiency is derived from mc simulation .",
    "the mc@nlo generator with pdf set ct10 is used for the generation of the @xmath0 signal , assuming a top quark mass of 172.5  gev . due to the large uncertainty in the multi - jet cross - section prediction ,",
    "a data - driven technique is employed to estimate the background , while the mc simulation is only used to estimate the uncertainty on the mass shape distribution for the background .",
    "0.48     0.48",
    "a kinematic fit is performed on the selected events to optimize the top - quark mass reconstruction .",
    "the fit is based on a likelihood approach to find the correct association of jets with the final state partons of the fully - hadronic @xmath0 decays .",
    "the likelihood function @xmath15 includes breit - wigner functions used to constrain the di - jet and the tri - jet masses to the @xmath5-boson mass and the top - quark mass , respectively .",
    "the top - quark mass is treated as a free parameter but it is constrained to be identical for the top and anti - top quark candidates . the @xmath5-boson mass and width are fixed to the known values in literature .",
    "additional terms are added taking into account the @xmath3-tagging algorithm response biasing the likelihood to select permutations in which a @xmath3-tagged jet is matched to a @xmath3-quark .",
    "the fit is performed for all possible permutations of jets and quarks and for each permutation the function @xmath16 is minimized with respect to the six jet energies and the reconstructed top - quark mass .",
    "the sum of all permutations is computed and the relative weight , normalized to unity , of the best computation is referred to as the _ event probability_.    the method is tested on simulated events passing the selection cuts . figure [ fig : topmassdistribution1](a ) shows the mass distribution obtained for the events where all the jets are correctly matched to the corresponding quarks using the mc truth information .",
    "as expected , the mass resolution is improved when using the jet energies calculated during the kinematic fitting procedure compared to just using the reconstructed jet energies .",
    "the fraction of signal events fully matched by the kinematical fit is found to be 11% .",
    "for the events where at least one jet is wrongly matched there is no gain in the mass resolution by performing the kinematic fit , as shown in figure [ fig : topmassdistribution1](b ) .",
    "few additional cuts are imposed before measuring the @xmath0 production cross section .",
    "events are required to have @xmath17  gev and a jet multiplicity between 6 and 10 . to further improve the signal to background ratio",
    ", cuts are introduced requiring the _ event probability _ to be greater than @xmath18 and the minimal mass @xmath19 to be less than @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath19 is defined as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the reconstructed jets and @xmath3-jets and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are obtained by the mean and the half - width gaussian parametrization of the top - quark and @xmath5-boson mass distributions given by the all - hadronic @xmath0 mc simulation .",
    "the minimal mass @xmath19 is defined as the minimum @xmath19 obtained when computing its value for every permutation per event . with this final event selection , the fraction of signal events fully matched by the kinematical fit rises to 36% .",
    "an unbinned likelihood fit is performed on the final data sample , shown in figure [ fig : topmassdistribution2](a ) .",
    "the signal template distribution is derived from mc simulation and includes both the @xmath0 combinatorial background and the correct combinations while the background template distribution is derived from data events in the same signal region but without imposing any @xmath3-tagging requirement .",
    "the signal fraction is estimated by the fitting procedure to be @xmath26 and considering the inclusive @xmath0 selection efficiency , derived from mc simulation , the total cross section is measured to be @xmath27  pb .    0.48 -tagging requirement @xcite .",
    "this distribution is used as a template of the multi - jet background for the likelihood fit and it is also shown in figure [ fig : topmassdistribution2 ] ( a ) .",
    "additional distributions obtained applying different corrections derived from mc simulations are overlaid using dashed lines.,title=\"fig : \" ]    0.48 -tagging requirement @xcite .",
    "this distribution is used as a template of the multi - jet background for the likelihood fit and it is also shown in figure [ fig : topmassdistribution2 ] ( a ) .",
    "additional distributions obtained applying different corrections derived from mc simulations are overlaid using dashed lines.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the events passing all the cuts but dropping the @xmath3-tagging requirement are found to be dominated by multi - jet events , with a residual fraction of all - hadronic @xmath0 events estimated to be 4.6% .",
    "the top - quark mass distribution obtained with this methodology , referred as to the untagged sample , is shown in figure [ fig : topmassdistribution2](b ) and is used as a template for the background in the likelihood fit .",
    "any @xmath3-tagging technique biases the jet @xmath28 distribution and therefore most of the kinematic distributions , such as the top - quark mass spectrum , are affected by systematic uncertainties related to the @xmath3-tagging requirement . to estimate the uncertainty on the background modelling",
    ", the top - quark mass shape is studied using simulated events for both generic multi - jet and exclusive @xmath29jets events and compared with and without the @xmath3-tagging requirement .",
    "the ratio of the top - quark mass distributions between the tagged and untagged and between the multi - jet and @xmath29jets samples are computed and applied to the untagged data sample .",
    "the effect of these corrections on the data - driven background is shown in figure [ fig : topmassdistribution2](b ) and the maximum variation between the nominal and the corrected cross sections gives a systematic uncertainty on the background modelling of 4% .",
    "the highest contribution to the total systematic uncertainty of the cross section measurement is from the jet energy scale and is estimated to be + 20/-11% .",
    "other sources of uncertainty were estimated and are related to the @xmath3-tagging efficiency and mistag rate ( @xmath30% ) , the initial and final state radiation ( @xmath30% ) , the dependence on the generator and on the parton shower ( @xmath31% ) , the multi - jet trigger efficiency ( @xmath32% ) , the parton distribution function ( + 7/-5% ) , the luminosity ( @xmath33 ) and the jet energy resolution ( @xmath34% ) .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty is estimated to be + 36/-34% .",
    "the production cross section of @xmath0 events in the all - hadronic decay channel was measured at the lhc using 4.7  fb@xmath1 of @xmath6 collisions at the lhc with the atlas detector .",
    "the vastly dominant background consists of multi - jet events and its shape is modelled using a fully data - driven technique .",
    "a kinematic fit is employed to derive the top - quark mass distribution which is then used to extract the cross section measurement with an unbinned likelihood fit .",
