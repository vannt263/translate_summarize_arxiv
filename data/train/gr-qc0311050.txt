    "dissipative bulk viscous type thermodynamical processes are supposed to play a crucial role in the dynamics and evolution of the early universe .",
    "there are many processes capable of producing bulk viscous stresses in the early cosmological fluid , like interaction between matter and radiation , quark and gluon plasma viscosity , different components of dark matter , particle creation , strings and topological defects etc .",
    "traditionally , for the description of these phenomena the theories of eckart @xcite and landau and lifshitz @xcite were used .",
    "but hiscock and lindblom @xcite have shown that the eckart - type theories suffer from serious drawbacks concerning causality and stability .",
    "regardless of the choice of equation of state , all equilibrium states in these theories are unstable and in addition signals may be propagated through the fluid at velocities exceeding the speed of light .",
    "these problems arise due to the first order nature of the theory , i.e. , it considers only first - order deviations from the equilibrium .",
    "the neglected second - order terms are necessary to prevent non - causal and unstable behavior .",
    "a relativistic consistent second - order theory was found by israel @xcite and developed into what is called transient or extended irreversible thermodynamics @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "hiscock and lindblom @xcite have shown that these second order theories are free of the pathologies of the eckart - type theories .",
    "therefore , the best currently available theory for analyzing dissipative processes in the universe is the full israel - stewart - hiscock causal thermodynamics",
    ".    exact general solutions of the field equations for flat homogeneous universes filled with a full causal viscous fluid source for a power - law dependence of the bulk viscosity coefficient on the energy density have been obtained in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the evolution of a homogeneous and isotropic dissipative fluid in the truncated israel - stewart theory has been analyzed , by using dynamical systems methods , by di prisco , herrera and ibanez @xcite .",
    "they have found that almost all solutions inflate , and only a few of them can be considered physical , since they do not satisfy the dominant energy condition .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to obtain the general solution of the gravitational field equations for the case of a bulk viscous cosmological fluid in a flat friedmann - robertson - walker type geometry , obeying the zeldovich ( stiff ) equation of state , with the bulk viscosity coefficient @xmath0 proportional to the energy density @xmath1 to the power @xmath2 , @xmath3 . in this case",
    "the solution of the gravitational field equations can be represented in an exact parametric form , in terms of bessel functions .",
    "the behavior of the scale factor , deceleration parameter , viscous pressure , viscous pressure - thermodynamic pressure ratio , comoving entropy and ricci and kretschmann invariants is also considered .",
    "the solution describes a non - inflationary universe , which starts its evolution from a singular state .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "the basic equations describing the dynamics of the viscous friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe are written down in section ii .",
    "the general solution of the field equations is obtained in section iii . in section",
    "iv we discuss and conclude our results .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor for a bulk viscous cosmological fluid is given by @xmath4 where @xmath1 is the energy density , @xmath5 the thermodynamic pressure , @xmath6 the bulk viscous pressure and @xmath7 the four velocity satisfying the condition @xmath8 .",
    "we use units so that @xmath9 .    for a flat friedmann - robertson - walker universe with a line element given by @xmath10 , filled with a bulk viscous cosmological fluid , the gravitational field equations and the continuity equation @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 denoting the covariant derivative with respect to the metric ) imply @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the hubble parameter . the causal evolution equation for the bulk viscous pressure",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the temperature , @xmath0 the bulk viscosity coefficient and @xmath17 the relaxation time .",

    "specify @xmath16 , @xmath0 and @xmath17 . as usual , we assume the following phenomenological laws @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are constants .",
    "( [ csi ] ) are standard in cosmological models whereas the equation for @xmath17 is a simple procedure to ensure that the speed of viscous pulses does not exceed the speed of light .",
    "the requirement that the entropy is a state function imposes in the present model the constraint @xmath29 @xcite so that @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "the growth of the total comoving entropy @xmath32 over a proper time interval @xmath33 is given by @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the israel - stewart - hiscock theory is derived under the assumption that the thermodynamical state of the fluid is close to equilibrium , that is the non - equilibrium bulk viscous pressure should be small when compared to the local equilibrium pressure @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "if this condition is violated then one is effectively assuming that the linear theory holds also in the nonlinear regime far from equilibrium .",
    "for a fluid description of the matter , the condition ought to be satisfied .    to see if a cosmological model inflates or not it is convenient to introduce the deceleration parameter @xmath37 .",
    "the positive sign of the deceleration parameter corresponds to standard decelerating models , whereas the negative sign indicates inflation .    with these assumptions",
    "the evolution equation for the flat homogeneous causal bulk viscous cosmological models is @xmath38    by introducing a set of non - dimensional variables @xmath39 and @xmath40 by means of the transformations @xmath41 , with @xmath42 , and using the expression of @xmath43 as a function of @xmath44 , eq .",

    "we assume that the bulk viscosity coefficient @xmath0 is of the form @xmath52 , with @xmath49 .",
