    "efforts to detect transits by jovian - mass planets in tight orbits about sun - like stars began soon after the detection of 51 peg b @xcite , and have intensified to the point that there are now some 20 such transit searches underway @xcite .",
    "results from these transit searches have been disappointing , however .",
    "for example , the vulcan project @xcite searched 6000 stars , locating 7 that displayed the shallow and short - duration eclipses that would characterize a planet .",
    "but spectroscopic and photometric follow - up observations showed that all of these eclipses result from stellar , not planetary , systems .",
    "similar results from the stare instrument @xcite will be reported elsewhere . the ogle - iii survey ( udalski et al .",
    "2002 , 2002a ) imaged some @xmath0 stars , of which 52000 were selected as likely main - sequence dwarfs . of these , 59 candidates showed eclipses that appeared consistent with planetary transits .",
    "of the 59 transit candidates , 6 are too faint for follow - up observations , and 3 may be planets @xcite , although the evidence for these is not yet conclusive .",
    "why then do ground - based searches yield so many false alarms and so few planets ?",
    "more generally , can one understand the observed detection rates for planets and for stellar systems that masquerade as planets , given existing knowledge about stars , multiple - star systems , and extrasolar planets ?",
    "finally , what does this understanding imply for the ambitious spaceborne missions corot @xcite , kepler @xcite and eddington @xcite , which aim to use transits to detect earth - sized planets in earth - like orbits ?",
    "estimating transit detection rates is complicated because many different kinds of stellar systems can produce transits resembling those from planets , and each of these requires its own methods , assumptions , and approximations .",
    "i categorize these cases in a tree structure , defined by the answers to the following questions : ( 1 ) is the primary of the eclipsing system a main - sequence star ( m ) or a giant ( g ) ?",
    "( 2 ) is the secondary a main - sequence star ( s ) or a jovian planet ( p ) ? ( 3 ) is the light from the binary undiluted by a third star ( u ) , or diluted ( d ) ? ( 4 ) if diluted , is the third star a foreground object ( f ) or is the system a bound triple ( t ) ?",
    "this scheme yields 12 possibilities .",
    "these classes are by no means exhaustive , but they encompass the kinds of systems that are most commonly found in ground - based searches .    of the 12 classes ,",
    "i shall discuss only 5 .",
    "the targets of ground - based searches are denoted mpu , ie , the primary is a main - sequence star and the secondary is a giant planet .",
    "the principal sources of false alarms involve grazing transits in systems of 2 main - sequence stars ( msu ) , diluted instances of these ( msdf , msdt ) , and transits of giants by main - sequence stars ( gsu ) .",
    "the remaining categories are less important because they are less common , because their eclipses do not usually simulate planetary transits , or both .",
    "to estimate detection rates , one wishes to know the probability of finding objects of each class with photometric properties lying within ranges that are appropriate to planetary transits .",
    "these `` observable '' photometric properties are the transit repetition period @xmath1 ( days ) , the transit duration @xmath2 ( days ) , and the relative depth of the transit @xmath3 ( in the range @xmath4 ) .",
    "in addition , one can usually say something about the nature of the primary star ; for main - sequence stars one may think of this as the primary s mass @xmath5 ( solar units ) , while for giants it is more convenient to use the j - k color @xmath6 , measured in magnitudes . the joint probability density ( for instance , @xmath7 ) then describes the probability that a randomly - chosen target star in a photometric survey is a main - sequence eclipsing binary with properties near the given ones .",
    "to obtain an estimate of the number of detections to be expected in the target sample from this class of object , one integrates this density over the interesting ranges of observable parameters and multiplies by the number of target stars in the sample . marginal probability densities ( integrated over all parameters but one ) are also useful , and some of these will be displayed below .",
    "unfortunately , the joint probability density in terms of the observable parameters is not ordinarily available .",
    "instead , one has empirical estimates ( e.g. , @xcite , henceforth called dm ) of probability densities for `` physical '' parameters taken singly , such as @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the orbital inclination to the line of sight , and @xmath13 is the binary mass ratio . to make these useful , one must first assume independence among the various physical parameters , so that the joint density may be written as a product of the individual densities . one must then transform the density @xmath14 into a density on the observable parameters @xmath7 .",
    "details of this process for the various cases will be published elsewhere ; for current purposes , all that matters is that the transformations contain no essential singularities . more important",
    "are the empirical distributions , the relations among stellar properties , and the assumptions invoked to derive the initial joint distributions and the transformations .",
    "these are described below .",
    "i characterized main - sequence binaries ( type msu ) by the 4 physical parameters discussed above , viz .",
    ", @xmath15 .",
    "i estimated @xmath9 using the local main - sequence luminosity function @xmath16 giving the space density of stars as a function of their v absolute magnitude , the mass - luminosity relation @xmath17 , and color - color relations ( e.g. @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the absolute magnitude for r - band photometry ) .",
    "i obtained all of these relations from the tables in @xcite , except that i adjusted the luminosity function to provide better agreement with the observed histogram of j - k color , for a field lying on the galactic plane in cygnus , overlapping the proposed field for the kepler mission .",
    "because of interstellar extinction , calculating @xmath9 also requires knowledge of the photometric bandpass and limiting magnitude appropriate to the survey being modeled , and of @xmath20 , defined as the typical distance needed to accumulate 1 magnitude of interstellar extinction in the v band .",
    "i used @xmath21 pc , and assumed that all observations are in the galactic plane .",
    "i took @xmath8 and @xmath11 from dm , and assumed the fraction of spatially unresolved main - sequence stars having 2 or more components to be 0.49 , in accord with their estimate .",
    "i assumed orbital axes to be randomly oriented in space , giving @xmath22 .",
    "finally , i adopted several simplifications to facilitate the calculations .",
    "the most important of these were : ( 1 ) i ignored the luminosity of the secondary component , relative to that of the primary .",
    "( 2 ) i simplified the mass - radius relation on the main sequence , taking radius ( in solar units ) to be numerically equal to mass ( in solar units ) .",
    "( 3 ) i took the stellar limb - darkening coefficient to be @xmath23 , irrespective of wavelength or stellar mass .",
    "( 4 ) for purposes of computing the system s semimajor axis , i ignored the mass of the secondary component .",
    "( 5 ) i assumed all binary orbits are circular .",
    "these approximations limit the accuracy of the final result ; combined with the uncertainties in the input probability densities , they suggest that the final estimates of detection rates are likely to be inaccurate by factors of a few .    for binaries with one giant component ( type gsu )",
    ", i took the same distributions @xmath8 , @xmath10 as for main - sequence binaries , except that i set @xmath8 to zero for periods such that the secondary would lie within the surface of the primary .",
    "i parameterized the giant primaries in terms of their v - k colors , by inventing an analytic 3-component distribution @xmath24 .",
    "this , combined with the relation ( for giants ) between spectral type and v - k from @xcite , gave space densities for spectral types g , k , and m ; i chose parameters in the analytic distribution to make these consistent with those tabulated in @xcite .",
    "given the v - k color , i computed the giant radius and luminosity from relations given by @xcite .",
    "color - color relations from @xcite then allowed estimation of @xmath25 .",
    "i assumed the distribution of secondary masses to be the same as @xmath9 , the distribution of main - sequence primary masses .",
    "i assumed that main - sequence binaries that are diluted by foreground stars ( type msdf ) consist of a binary with properties drawn from the msu distribution , superposed on a foreground star whose r magnitude lies within the range of r magnitudes covered by the survey being modeled .",
    "i used the tabulation of number of stars @xmath26 per v magnitude per square degree of sky taken from @xcite , for a galactic latitude of 0@xmath27 ( scaled to match the counts for @xmath28 observed in cygnus by the stare telescopes ) to estimate the number of background stars in each interval of magnitude lying within a specified confusion radius ( in arcsec ) of the foreground star .",
    "i then computed the distribution of apparent transit depth from the distribution of relative brightnesses of the foreground and background stars , combined with the msu distribution of transit depth for the background system taken alone .",
    "i assumed that triples ( type msdt ) are composed of a main - sequence binary drawn from the msu distribution , combined with a third star drawn from the observed luminosity distribution .",
    "this ignores triples in which 2 or more members are giants .",
    "calculation of the relative depth distribution then proceeded in the same way as for msdf systems .",
    "the probability distribution for planets orbiting main - sequence stars ( type mpu ) may be calculated by methods exactly analogous to those for msu systems , except that the dm distributions for period and for secondary mass ( implying radius , in the stellar case ) are inapplicable .",
    "i estimated the distribution of jovian planetary periods @xmath29 using the tabulation by @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the normalized cumulative distribution of @xmath30 against @xmath31 for the 103 planets listed as of 4 april 2003 ; the derivative of this distribution is the probability density @xmath32 , for stars having at least one jovian planet .",
    "also shown is a piecewise linear fit to the distribution , corresponding to @xmath33 for the 3 period intervals bounded by @xmath34 .",
    "multiplying this by the probability that a given star has a jovian planet , which i took to be .05 @xcite , gives the probability density that i assumed for calculating the mpu distributions .",
    "the relative dearth of planets with periods between 5 and 200 days is a striking feature of this density .",
    "udry , mayor , & santos ( 2003 ) have remarked on it also , arguing that it carries information about the migration ( or , less likely , formation ) process that places massive planets in the orbits they now occupy .    in the interest of simplicity",
    ", i assumed that the distribution of planet radii is uniform between 0.08 and 0.15 solar radii ( 0.78 to 1.46 jupiter radii ) .",
    "this spans the range from objects slightly smaller than saturn to ones slightly larger than hd 209458b .",
    "i ignored the likely relation between a planet s equilibrium temperature and its radius .",
    "finally , one must consider the probability that transits with a particular period will be observed , given a realistic set of observing epochs .",
    "the observing window is a major concern for ground - based observations , but will presumably be less important for those from spacecraft . except in cases with unusually low noise ,",
    "detections of single transits are almost useless ( because many processes make false signals that look like isolated transits ) , and 2-transit detections are suspect .",
    "the most reliable cases are those with 3 or more transits . for a typical observing run using the stare telescope ( 211 hours of observation on 38 individual nights , spread over an interval of 91 days ) , even for periods as short as 3 days ,",
    "the probability of seeing 3 transits with the observations just described is only about 0.5 .",
    "for longer periods , the visibility drops sharply , accentuating the already strong bias towards short - period planets .",
    "based on the assumptions described in the previous sections , i computed detection rates for jovian planets and for the 4 false alarm categories , for a survey with properties similar to vulcan or stare . to do this , i integrated the probability densities over all stellar types , over periods in the range @xmath37d , over relative depths @xmath38 , and over transit durations @xmath39d .",
    "( the lower limit on @xmath2 comes from detectability considerations , but few additional transits would be counted if it were lowered to zero . )",
    "i assumed a confusion radius of 20 arcsec ( about 1.8 detector pixel widths , for these systems ) , and a limiting r magnitude of 12 .",
    "the leftmost 3 columns of table 1 show the estimated detection rates per @xmath40 stars ( this being approximately how many stars one can observe simultaneously with current facilities ) , for detection of at least 0 , 2 , and 3 transits , assuming the observing window function described in the previous section .",
    "the most important result from table 1 is the low rate of planet detection  only about 0.4 detection per @xmath40 stars , for 3-transit detections .",
    "naive estimates give detection rates about 5 times larger than this .",
    "nevertheless , the value from table 1 is probably an overestimate , since a proportion of main - sequence stars are members of close binaries in which small planetary orbits would be unstable , and since image crowding and other effects make it difficult to achieve 1% photometric precision for all target stars .",
    "there are two principal reasons for the small expected rate of planet detection .",
    "the first is the low efficiency of single - site observations , as already discussed .",
    "the second is best illustrated by using the luminosity function and color - color relations to construct a histogram showing the expected number of observed stars per square degree as a function of j - k color .",
    "figure 2 shows this histogram , as calculated from the various model relations and also as observed for the stare cygnus field , using the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) catalog as the source of j - k colors . in fig .",
    "2 , stars with j - k @xmath41 are almost exclusively dwarfs , while those with j - k @xmath42 are predominantly giants .",
    "the hatched area , containing only 14% of all stars , shows those stars with radii less than 1.3 @xmath43 , i.e. , those for which a central transit by a fairly large planet would have @xmath36 .",
    "thus , even among main - sequence stars , only about a third of the stars in the sample will have radii small enough for transits to be observed in a routine way .",
    "moreover , any failings in photometric precision cause a disproportionate decrease in the planet catch .",
    "figure 3 shows the expected distribution of @xmath3 for transits by planets , by main - sequence binaries , and by diluted binary and triple systems .",
    "only about a third of all planetary transits should have @xmath3 as large as .01 , and the fraction drops rapidly as the @xmath3 threshold is raised .",
    "the most common source of false alarms is main - sequence binaries ( type msu ) .",
    "these should occur at a rate of several per @xmath40 target stars , and should typically show relatively large depths and short periods . diluted",
    "main - sequence transits account for the rest of the false alarms , about equally distributed between types msdf and msdt .",
    "although they are intrinsically rare , the triple systems appear fairly commonly in transit searches because their @xmath3 distribution peaks near .01 , the canonical value for transits by jovian planets . integrating over the full ranges in all of the parameters \\ { @xmath5 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 , @xmath2 } shows that about 1.2% of all stars observed should reveal themselves as eclipsing binaries ( ignoring window function effects ) .",
    "although detailed comparisons with these predictions have not yet been made , these false alarm and eclipsing - binary rates seem to agree with experience from the stare and vulcan surveys , at least within a factor of 2 .",
    "space missions targeting earth - sized planets in earth - like orbits will search a different range of parameter space , seeking shallower transits by objects in longer - period orbits . for the purposes of these missions ,",
    "all of the signal categories so far considered represent possible false alarms .",
    "the rightmost column of table 1 shows their expected rates of occurrence per @xmath40 target stars , for a survey that is magnitude - limited at @xmath46 , and for transit parameters in the ranges @xmath47d , @xmath48 , and @xmath49d .",
    "the msdf value assumes a confusion radius of 6 arcsec ( about 3 pixels widths for the kepler instrument ) , and i assumed that the observing window function plays no role .",
    "note that the mpu entry in this column refers only to false alarms from grazing transits by jupiter - sized planets , not to true detections of earth - sized planets ; if all sun - like stars have solar systems similar to our own , the number of true detections should be @xmath50 per @xmath40 target stars .    by far",
    "the largest source of false alarms in this case is faint background main - sequence binaries . the number of such binaries per square degree of sky increases rapidly as the binaries grow fainter , so that the marginal distribution @xmath51 rises sharply for small @xmath3 .",
    "although false alarms of type msdf will be common in spaceborne surveys , they will be easy to identify and ignore .",
    "the easiest discriminant will be to compare the centroid of the target star image with the centroid of the transiting signal .",
    "displacements of a fraction of a pixel can be detected in this way , filtering out more than 99% of the background binaries .",
    "results from searches for transiting jovian planets can be understood in terms of our existing knowledge of binary star systems and of extrasolar planets . to make searches of this sort successful",
    ", it will be necessary to ( 1 ) improve the duty cycle and coverage of the observations over that possible from a single observing site , ( 2 ) attain the best possible precision in the photometric time series , and ( 3 ) plan to observe more stars , by factors of several , than has been undertaken to date .",
    "spaceborne missions searching for transits by earth - sized planets will need to take care in the selection of their target lists , so that resources are not wasted on unsuitable , large - radius stars .",
    "the problem of false alarms will be less serious for these missions , except for diluted transits arising from faint background eclipsing binary stars .",
    "for both ground- and space - based observations , it would be useful to extend the results of the present modeling effort to regions off the galactic plane .",
