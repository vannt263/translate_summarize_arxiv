    "neutrino flavor transformations are a fascinating problem that have provided many interesting avenues of research over the years .",
    "one such avenue is the effect different environments have on the evolution of neutrino flavor . in the case of a high neutrino density , such as in sn",
    ", the neutrinos will undergo collective oscillations due to interactions between the neutrinos themselves @xcite .",
    "also , neutrinos traveling through matter will undergo various msw - type transitions due to interactions with the surrounding matter @xcite . that matter profile may be very chaotic and there exists a rich history of study into the effect of fluctuations on the msw - type transitions of neutrinos in various environments .",
    "for example , the small fluctuations in the sun and earth have been investigated @xcite , as well as the large fluctuations in sn @xcite .",
    "recently , collective effects in sn have been studied in the presence of density fluctuations @xcite and the synthesis of collective , msw effects and turbulence was investigated in @xcite where it was shown that features in the neutrino spectrum indicating the effects of self - interactions and/or msw transitions may be partially or completely erased .",
    "most of these works explained the effect of turbulence in terms of msw - type transitions in the sense that density fluctuations increases the number of locations where a neutrino fulfills the msw resonance condition in a particular mixing channel .",
    "in addition to increased mixing between the given two states , three flavor effects start to appear as the turbulence amplitude increases @xcite and oscillation channels that show no transitions with small amplitude turbulence are affected when the amplitude becomes large . in certain cases , a phenomenon known as depolarization has been observed , in which all information about the neutrinos initial state is lost @xcite .",
    "depolarization allows one to describe the final state of the ensemble of neutrinos as a simple probability distribution unrelated to the initial state .",
    "it is not known for certain whether these conditions are met in sn . to determine if depolarization occurs in sn , it is necessary to study the histories of individual sn neutrinos . on the other hand ,",
    "if depolarization is found not to occur in sn , the individual histories will be needed since the final state of the ensemble will depend on the initial conditions .",
    "all of this research has produced important advances , but in order to get the full picture we must have a complete understanding of the scales of fluctuations that affect the neutrino transformations most .",
    "and then there are some neutrino transitions in fluctuating matter densities which can not be well explained by msw theory because they occur of over a distance scale that is much longer than the oscillation scale .",
    "instead , they fit into a category of transformations known as stimulated transitions , caused by parametric resonance .",
    "this effect is similar to msw - type transitions , in that it results from interactions with matter .",
    "however , whereas msw - type transitions occur when neutrinos pass through material at a resonant density , stimulated transitions are caused by matching the frequency of fluctuation to the eigenvalue splitting of the neutrino system @xcite .",
    "this frequency matching can happen at any density scale , allowing for the possibility of flavor transformations even far from the msw resonance .",
    "it has also been shown that harmonics of the eigenvalue splitting can cause a parametric resonance @xcite .",
    "parametric resonances in neutrinos are very similar to stimulating transitions between energy levels in an atom using a laser @xcite , and in fact many of the equations used to describe the two systems closely resemble one another . since any density profile , even a turbulent one , can be decomposed into fourier modes of different frequencies , the parametric resonance approach is a natural one to take .    in previous work @xcite",
    ", we have shown that the approach based upon the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) can be used to accurately predict the transition wavelength and amplitude for neutrinos traveling through turbulence with up to forty modes .",
    "this previous work was restricted to turbulence superimposed on a constant density profile and the purpose of this present work is to expand to tackling the issues associated with a changing profile . in section [ methods ] , we reiterate the rwa solution and the important scales of the problem and propose how one can apply these results to a non - constant density profile . in section [ predict ]",
    "we then test our proposal by applying it to a model sn profile and discover that it works well . based upon that success , section [ vary ]",
    "examines the effect of changing parameters of the power spectrum of the turbulence and then in section [ antinu ] we show how we are able to predict transition between antineutrino states , clearly illustrating the utility of the stimulated transition approach to explain those cases where msw transitions are not expected . in section [ application ]",
    "we use our method to explain the recent null result of turbulence upon neutrinos passing through a 2d simulation , and then finish with our conclusions .",
    "we are interested in calculating the probability that a neutrino starting in state @xmath0 at point @xmath1 is in state @xmath2 at some later point @xmath3 .",
    "these states are both at different locations and in different hilbert spaces .",
    "this can be accomplished by computing the @xmath4-matrix , which provides a connection between the initial and final states through the equation @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this @xmath4-matrix is the path ordered exponential of the hamiltonian and evolves via the equation @xmath6 in the flavor basis , the hamiltonian @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the vacuum mixing matrix , @xmath10 is a matrix containing the vacuum eigenvalues , and @xmath11 describes some potential through which the neutrino moves .",
    "we separate our potential into two pieces : a smooth base potential @xmath12 and the perturbation @xmath13 . with this separation",
    ", we now write our hamiltonian as @xmath14 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath15 and all other quantities denoted by a ` breve ' are unperturbed quantities , which includes the vacuum contribution and the smooth potential , but not the perturbation @xmath13 .",
    "we can define an unperturbed matter basis , which is related to the flavor basis through a unitary mixing matrix @xmath16 by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues of @xmath15 .    at this point",
    ", we will make the assumption that the potential @xmath19 has only one non - zero component , that of @xmath20 , making the potential ` msw'-like .",
    "we are interested in the effects of perturbations of the form @xmath21,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the number of modes , with each mode having wavenumber @xmath23 , amplitude @xmath24 , and phase shift @xmath25 .",
    "the phase shifts @xmath25 are randomly distributed between 0 and @xmath26 , while the amplitudes and wavenumbers follow a kolmogorov power spectrum , given by@xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the cutoff scale and sets the lowest allowed frequencies for the spectrum .",
    "the power spectrum @xmath30 is a measure of the power in the turbulence at each frequency and is related the amplitudes @xmath24 in equation ( [ eq : perturbation ] ) through the simple relationship @xmath31 . due to the inverse power law nature of the spectrum ,",
    "longer wavelength modes will have more power and thus larger amplitudes .",
    "the amplitudes and frequencies for the @xmath22 modes are chosen using the randomization method described in @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we investigate the effects of changing two parameters of the turbulent spectrum .",
    "the first is the root - mean - square ( rms ) amplitude , defined as @xmath32 .",
    "sn simulations have reported a wide range of rms amplitudes .",
    "the amount of turbulence in the sn progenitor has been reported as @xmath33 , providing a lower limit to the turbulence in the explosion @xcite .",
    "upper limits in sn turbulence reach up to @xmath34 , justified from the multidimensional physics required for a large star to actually explode in simulations @xcite . given",
    "the variety of values for @xmath35 reported , we study how these changes alter the neutrino propagation .",
    "the second parameter is the cutoff wavelength , defined as @xmath36 .",
    "the cutoff wavelengths used in previous work have varied from tens of kilometers @xcite to thousands or tens of thousands of kilometers @xcite . from the work in @xcite , we know that long wavelength modes can have a suppressive effect on the neutrino transformations , so a change in cutoff wavelength could make a drastic difference in the resulting transitions .",
    "once again , due to the large range of previously used cutoff wavelengths , we look into how varying this parameter affects the neutrino propagation .    in the case of a constant density ( @xmath37 ) ,",
    "the probability of transition between the unperturbed states 1 and 2 , the eigenstates of @xmath15 , is given by @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath40 .",
    "the oscillation wavelength @xmath41 is an important quantity for determining where transitions occur on a changing profile , as will be explained later .",
    "we further define @xmath42 and @xmath43 . here , @xmath44 , where the @xmath45 are the eigenvalues of @xmath15 .",
    "the full derivation of this rwa solution can be found in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath46 in the definition of @xmath47 are integers , chosen using a simplex with @xmath48 , or negative the amplitude , as the potential .",
    "the simplex locates the set of @xmath46 which best satisfy the parametric resonance condition @xmath49 while also minimizing the value of @xmath48 .",
    "this method was shown to produce predictions similar to brute force numerical results in @xcite .    using this analytic solution ,",
    "two important wavelength scales have been identified .",
    "the first is associated with the neutrino mass splitting and defined as    @xmath50^{-1/2}.\\ ] ]    density perturbations with wavelengths close to @xmath51 cause parametric resonances and have been discussed in works such as @xcite .",
    "this length scale corresponds to those modes with a non - zero contribution to the parametric resonance condition , @xmath49 , where then @xmath52 .",
    "the second wavelength is related to the amplitude of the density fluctuations , and can suppress the transitions caused by @xmath51 . a good physical analog this suppression is the stark effect .",
    "for a two - level atom , a laser tuned to the correct frequency can stimulate a transition between states . applying an external field to that atom",
    "will shift the wavefunctions and energies of the original states , such that the laser that once stimulated transitions can no longer do so .    in the neutrino system ,",
    "the `` laser '' consists of the modes which contribute to the parametric resonance .",
    "the `` external electric field '' is made up of the rest of the modes in the turbulence .",
    "these modes cause a distortion to the system which prevents the parametric resonance from causing a transition .",
    "we showed in @xcite that this distortion can be quantified , and that the modes which cause the largest distortion have wavelengths given by @xmath53 , given by    @xmath54    note that equation ( [ eq : fluctampl ] ) has been modified : here we have included mixing matrix elements that were approximated as being of order 1 previously .",
    "the values of @xmath55 correspond to those modes where the value of @xmath43 is close to a zero of the bessel function @xmath56 .",
    "when such a zero is encountered , the value of @xmath57 , and the amplitude of the transition , is heavily suppressed .",
    "the modes that contribute the @xmath56 to the induced wavelength and amplitude have @xmath58 and therefore are not the modes that trigger the parametric resonance condition .",
    "however , they distort the underlying density profile .",
    "these results are summarized in figures ( [ fig : lambdavsc ] ) and ( [ fig : lambdavsrho ] ) .",
    "figure ( [ fig : lambdavsc ] ) shows the amplitude as a function of perturbation wavelengths at a constant density of 941 g/@xmath59 , which is half of the msw density for neutrinos with an energy of 20 mev , @xmath60 = 3@xmath61 ev@xmath62 and a mixing angle of @xmath63 .",
    "the solid red line shows the value of @xmath51 , while the dashed blue line represents the second scale of @xmath55 .",
    "the shaded region above @xmath55 is the suppression region .",
    "fluctuations whose wavelength and amplitude places them in the suppression region are likely to cause a suppression of the stimulated transitions .",
    "the black points shown on this figure are the amplitude and wavelengths for a randomly generated kolmogorov spectrum with rms amplitude of 10% and a cutoff wavelength of @xmath64 km .",
    "this particular set of wavelengths and frequencies was shown to exhibit a dramatic suppression effect in figure ( 4 ) of @xcite , reducing the amplitude of the transitions from unity to @xmath65 .",
    "in fact , as we can see in figure ( [ fig : lambdavsc ] ) , some of the points in this spectrum fall very close to or within the suppression region .",
    "the solid red line indicates @xmath51 , while the dashed blue curve shows @xmath55 .",
    "the shaded blue area is the suppression region .",
    "black points indicate amplitudes and wavelengths for a kolmogorov power spectrum known to produce suppression .",
    "one of the modes in this spectrum does fall in the suppression region . ]",
    "we can also look at these scales in the plane of perturbation wavelength and density , shown in figure ( [ fig : lambdavsrho ] ) .",
    "as before , the solid red and dashed blue curve indicate @xmath51 and @xmath55 , respectively , and the shaded blue area is the suppression region . in this case ,",
    "multiple lines can be drawn for @xmath55 depending on the amplitude @xmath24 being considered . at a given density , any perturbation with an amplitude @xmath24 and a wavelength that places it above the @xmath55 curve for that @xmath24 will cause suppression .",
    "as an example , we have plotted the curve for @xmath66 , the amplitude of the first mode in the spectrum plotted in figure ( [ fig : lambdavsc ] ) .",
    "the single magenta point shows the wavelength and density for that mode in this example .",
    "we already know this particular spectrum displays suppression , and now we can confirm that this mode specifically is contributing to that suppression as it falls on the @xmath55 curve .",
    ", shows the value of @xmath51 while the dashed blue curves show the value of @xmath55 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the magenta point is the longest wavelength mode from the example spectrum used in figure ( [ fig : lambdavsc ] ) , which has amplitude @xmath66 .",
    "]      we want to now move to the case of a non - constant @xmath12 . as a first case we consider a smooth parameterized supernova model taken from fogli _ et al .",
    "_ , with the shock at the @xmath69s position @xcite .",
    "we use a two - flavor system for simplicity , with the energy of the neutrino set to 20 mev , a vacuum mass splitting of @xmath70 ev@xmath62 and a vacuum mixing angle of @xmath71 .",
    "this parametrized sn model includes a single shock and a 20 mev neutrino will pass through three msw resonances , one of which is the shock , for the mixing parameters and neutrino energy chosen .",
    "the turbulence in front of the shock at 4.22@xmath72 km is expected to be negligible , so our calculation ends at the shock in all cases discussed here .",

    "the small rises in the probability near @xmath74 cm and @xmath75 cm occur at the first two msw resonances .",
    "based on these results , we can conclude that any large transitions in probability that we see after inserting turbulence must be due to parametric resonances caused by the perturbations .",

    "_ profile with no perturbations .",
    "the msw resonance potential for neutrinos with an energy of 20 mev , @xmath70 ev@xmath62 , and @xmath76 is indicated in the top panel by the dotted black line .",
    "the very low probability indicates that any large transitions seen with perturbations are due to parametric resonances . ]    our proposal for how to apply the constant density method is to insert spatial dependence into previously constant quantities , such as @xmath16 and @xmath77 , and calculating the stimulated transition wavelength @xmath78 as a function of position .",
    "we then determine whether the transition wavelength is less than the density scale height , defined as @xmath79 , where the mass density @xmath80 is proportional to @xmath81 .",
    "the density scale height is a measure of how fast the potential changes with distance . in order to see a transition we require that the predicted transition wavelength , @xmath78 , must be smaller than @xmath82",
    "this indicates that the transition is occurring faster than the density is changing . in the following sections",
    ", we will use this method to make predictions of the locations of transitions .",
    "we will also use this method to study the effects of changing the turbulence parameters @xmath35 and @xmath83 , as well as predict transitions between antineutrino states .",
    "one of the major advantages of the rwa approach is the ability to predict where large transitions are likely to occur as neutrinos travel through a density profile .",
    "numerical calculations can be computationally expensive , but with the rwa approach , we can determine if a profile will prove interesting or not before using that valuable computing power . here , we will show the predictive power of the rwa solution",
    ".    we will start with a case of four modes ( @xmath84 ) with a rms amplitude of @xmath85 and a cutoff wavelength of @xmath86 km .",
    "frequencies , amplitudes and phases for the four modes are listed in table ( [ table:4modes ] ) .",
    "the small number of modes was chosen to make transitions very clear to the reader while the cutoff wavelength ensures that no suppressive effects will be present .",
    "the method also works with higher numbers of modes , and an example of this will be described later .",

    "the perturbation in this case has @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath87 km . ]    in the top panel , we can observe many points where the parametric resonance condition is met .",
    "however , nearly all of them are eliminated by the density scale height condition as can be seen in the middle panel .",
    "the bottom panel shows @xmath91 , where we see that the predicted locations for transitions line up well with actual features in the probability . in particular , a transition of @xmath92",
    "is seen near 2@xmath93 cm .",
    "the size of transitions for antineutrinos are typically of smaller amplitude even when @xmath35 is the same , as can be seen by a direct comparison of the bottom panels of figure ( [ fig : antinu ] ) and figures ( [ fig:4modes ] ) and ( [ fig:20modes ] ) .",
    "similar to the case of small @xmath35 discussed above and shown in the leftmost panel of figure ( [ fig : crmsvary ] ) , the resonances for the antineutrinos are very narrow .",
    "this causes the system to spend relatively little time on the resonance , resulting in incomplete transitions .",
    "the narrow resonances can be explained by the fact that the antineutrino system is far from the msw resonance . as mentioned in @xcite ,",
    "the width of the resonance is proportional to @xmath94 . from equation ( [ eq : kappa ] )",
    ", we see that @xmath95 .",
    "this product of mixing matrix elements is small when far from the msw resonance , resulting in a small value of @xmath94 and a correspondingly narrow resonance .",
    "this example clearly illustrates the difference between the msw and parametric resonance viewpoints . using strictly msw methods , no transitions of any size",
    "would be predicted for antineutrinos in the normal hierarchy . using the parametric resonance method with the rwa solution ,",
    "we are able to predict that in fact some transitions should occur as well as locate them as we did for the neutrinos .",
    "a recent paper by borriello _ et al . _",
    "@xcite performed a fourier analysis on the results of a 2d sn simulation from the garching group @xcite . in that work ,",
    "analysis was carried out for 768 radial directions .",
    "for each of these directions , average densities and complete power spectra were found for the section of the profile before the forward shock .",
    "neutrino crossing probabilities were then calculated for the entire profile , including the shocks .",
    "the authors concluded that the turbulence had no real effect on the neutrinos , and the most relevant piece of the density profile is in fact the shock .",
    "we have examined the results in order to determine whether it is possible to explain the results using the rwa approach .",
    "three specific cases from the 768 total radial directions were used by borriello _",
    "_ as examples , with the density profile and power spectra shown .",
    "using these three examples , we have determined the approximate average density , wavelengths and amplitudes for the the three radial directions used in that work . from this information",
    ", we can create a plot of wavelength and amplitude like figure ( [ fig : lambdavsc ] ) .",
    "this is shown in figure ( [ fig : borriello ] ) .        unlike in figure ( [ fig : lambdavsc ] ) which showed the relevant wavelengths for a single neutrino energy , here a red band",
    "is used to represent @xmath51 for a range of energies from 5 to 50 mev .",
    "the values of @xmath55 are also plotted for various energies in blue dashed lines , but the different energies are indistinguishable on the scale of these plots .",
    "black points represent the wavelengths and amplitudes found in the 2d sn analysis .",
    "the first thing to notice is that none of the points for wavelength and amplitude of these spectra fall within the parametric resonance region indicated by the red band . as such",
    ", we can already expect that these profiles will not produce large transitions due to parametric resonance for any energy of neutrino .",
    "in addition , many of these amplitudes and wavelengths fall within the suppression regions .",
    "these modes are likely further suppressing any small transitions that might have occurred . based on this analysis",
    ", we would also expect to see very little occurring in the region where turbulence is present , exactly as observed by borriello _",
    "_ @xcite .    in order to produce stimulated transitions ,",
    "these spectra could be modified in several ways .",
    "the first would be to reduce the length of the shortest wavelengths , pulling the lower edge of the spectrum into the parametric resonance region .",
    "the length is constrained by the resolution of this particular sn simulation , which in this case was on the order of 10 km , but the resolution of these type of simulations is constantly improving .",
    "in addition , strong stimulated transitions are being suppressed by the many modes falling in the suppression region . as such , even if the spectra are modified to include shorter wavelengths , the size of any transitions will be diminished .",
    "these modes must be removed to eliminate the suppression effect .",
    "this would obviously be an artificial process , as those long wavelength modes were observed in simulated sn data .",
    "our analysis using the rwa method and the knowledge of the important scales of the problem show that no stimulated transitions should be expected in the turbulence region of the sn simulation .",
    "this matches well with the conclusions of the authors .",
    "applying our method to simulation data and obtaining similar results shows the strength of the analytic solution we have presented here .",
    "we have extended the work of @xcite and @xcite to encompass a changing density profile . using the concept of parametric resonances ,",
    "we have developed a method to predict the locations of possible transitions in a model sn profile .    from the rwa solution , we locate points where the parametric resonance condition is fulfilled . if the predicted wavelength at these points is lower than the density scale height , a transition is expected .",
    "we have shown that this simple method can pinpoint the transitions that appear in the probability .",
    "we have shown that this method accurately predicts the locations of large transitions , both in an example with @xmath84 modes and one with @xmath89 modes .",
    "we have also shown the effects of changing the rms amplitude and cutoff scale of the turbulence . increasing the rms amplitude causes two effects : a higher number of parametric resonances and a decrease in the transition wavelengths .",
    "the resonance peaks are also broader , meaning that the system spends a longer amount of time at the shorter wavelength , allowing for complete transitions from one state to another .",
    "the increase in resonances , along with the shorter transition wavelengths , causes many overlapping transitions for higher rms amplitudes .",
    "the end result is increasingly chaotic looking probabilities as the rms amplitude increases .    increasing the cutoff scale of the turbulence also results in two simultaneous effects .",
    "first , the long wavelength modes cause a suppression , as described in @xcite .",
    "these modes cause a distortion to the system , to the point that a parametric resonance no longer causes a transition .",
    "this suppression reduces the amplitude of any transitions that do still occur .",
    "second , increasing the cutoff scale lowers the amplitudes of short wavelength modes , some of which cause the parametric resonance .",
    "this second effect causes longer transition wavelengths , so that the wavelength is much longer than the distance over which the transition occurs .",
    "these two effects , the suppression and the long transition wavelengths , cause transitions that are smaller in amplitude and lower in number .    the rwa method has been successfully applied to antineutrinos , demonstrating its usefulness in cases where msw transitions are not expected . using the same criteria described for locating stimulated transitions for neutrinos , we are able to predict where such events would occur in the antineutrinos as well .",
    "these predictions were verified upon inspection of the numerically calculated probabilities .    finally , we have applied our method to the analysis of a 2d sn simulation @xcite .",
    "the authors of that study found that the turbulence present had no effect on the flavor transformations of the neutrinos .",
    "we have shown that the wavelengths and amplitudes found in that analysis do not fall within the parametric resonance region , due to the resolution scale being longer than the wavelengths @xmath51 .",
    "in addition , many of the modes fall in the suppression region . from these two facts",
    "we conclude , as borriello _",
    "_ did , that the neutrinos would not undergo any transitions in the turbulence region . if this is true of all sn , that there are no fluctuations on the scale of @xmath51 and significant fluctuations on the scale of @xmath55 , then transitions in sn due to parametric resonance are no expected .",
    "future simulations must be carefully analyzed with an eye toward these important scales .",
    "we have described the important wavelength scales for neutrinos traveling through turbulence , both those that stimulate transitions and those that suppress them .",
    "we have shown that the rwa solution can be used in a problem with a changing density profile , and discussed the effects of changing certain parameters of the turbulence .",
    "we have also been able to apply our method to a separate sn simulation analysis and explain the results found by the original authors .",
    "these steps together show that the rwa solution is an important tool for the future study of neutrino oscillations in turbulence .",
