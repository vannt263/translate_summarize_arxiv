    "in the ultra - high - energy domain , the mechanism of inelastic hadronic collisions is dominated by the contribution from small-@xmath0 gluons .",
    "this is the basic reason why the total or inelastic proton - proton collision cross section increases as a function of the incident energy . a simple way to see",
    "this is to use the eikonal expression for the reaction cross section in the impact parameter representation as@xmath1 , \\label{inela}\\]]where the eikonal @xmath2 counts essentially the total number of possible scattering centers of the constituents inside the target seen  by the projectile passing through the target along a straight line with the impact parameter @xmath3 and with center - of - mass energy @xmath4 .",
    "if the target is thick enough , the eikonal function is much larger than unity ( @xmath5 ) in the central region , but it falls down to zero in the surface region .",
    "the integrand of eq.([inela ] ) keeps a value almost equal to unity while @xmath6 and falls down quickly to zero near the surface . from this",
    "we may determine an effective radius @xmath7 such that the integral ( [ inela ] ) is approximately given by @xmath8here @xmath7 might be estimated by fixing the value of @xmath9 , for example , as @xmath10so that the effective radius depends on the energy @xmath11 .",
    "let us assume that the eikonal function factorizes in the form    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the probability distribution of the scattering center ( e.g. , partons ) in the transverse plane and @xmath14 is the number of partons which can interact for a given @xmath4 .",
    "suppose that @xmath13 is a two - dimensional gaussian distribution of width @xmath15 @xmath16and that , for large @xmath4 , the number of partons increase with @xmath17 as @xmath18then , we have @xmath19 in such a situation , the reaction cross section increases as function of the incident energy for very large @xmath4 as @xmath20    if the edge of the distribution has an exponential tail instead of a gaussian distribution , a similar argument will show that the cross section would increase as @xmath21    the important point of this simple argument is that the rate of increase is related to the diffuseness @xmath22 of the probability distribution of the scattering center . the more diffuse the surface thickness is , the more quickly the reaction cross section increases as function of the incident energy .",
    "the possibility of such a mechanism , not only in the proton - proton but also in nucleus - nucleus cross section , was suggested many years ago  kodama , kodama1 .    in this paper",
    "we explore the idea of  @xcite in the language of the qcd gluon saturation mechanism for the proton - nucleus reaction .",
    "we show that , if the gluon distribution becomes saturated at some energy scale inside the nuclear surface region , then the reaction cross section of proton - nucleus collisions starts to increase very quickly and eventually overcomes the values estimated by the usual glauber type of calculation .    applying a simple effective dipole model for the reaction mechanism",
    ", we find that such an energy scale is of the order of @xmath23 above this energy scale , the behavior of the proton - nucleus cross section begins to change .",
    "we suggest that such an energy dependence of the proton - nucleus cross section may be observed in terms of the quantity called @xmath24 in the air showers of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays . using a very simple toy model estimate of @xmath25",
    ", we show that our calculated values of the proton - nucleus reaction cross section are consistent with the recently observed @xmath26 by the pierre auger observatory experiments  @xcite for incident protons at ultra - high energies .",
    "to explore the above idea , we need the total cross section of proton - proton as function of incident energy which permit to extrapolate to the ultra - high energy region . for this purpose , we introduce an extremely simplified version of the dipole saturation model for the purpose of illustrating our idea here .",
    "the original dipole model was first introduced by mueller  mueller and extended to the impact parameter representation by kowalski and teaney  @xcite .",
    "recently this model was applied to fit diffractive structure functions in electron - nucleus collisions  kowalskiea , kowalskiea2,bartels .",
    "an application to proton - proton processes can be found in  @xcite , where the incident proton is represented by dipoles associated with the valence quarks , having a probability distribution for different sizes specified by the proton wave function .    in this work , for simplicity , we assume that the proton is described by an effective dipole of a given size @xmath27 , where we fix the dipole size @xmath28 by the average dipole radius    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the proton dipole wave function @xcite in the transverse plane .    in this case , the gluon saturation model leads to a reaction cross section ,    @xmath31    where the eikonal for the proton - proton reaction can be written as @xmath32 in this expression , the quantity @xmath33 is the parton distribution function ( pdf ) , and represents the gluon density @xmath34distribution in the target at a scale @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the strong coupling defined at this scale . following the steps of",
    "@xcite we use    @xmath37    @xmath38    @xmath39    with @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    for the profile function @xmath42 of a proton , we consider the two different cases described in below .",
    "suppose that the transverse probability distribution of gluons ( profile function ) inside the proton is of a gaussian type : @xmath43writing eq.([sigma_inel ] ) as@xmath44where @xmath45@xmath46 is the euler constant , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are hyperbolic - cosine and hyperbolic - sine integral functions .",
    "the function@xmath49is a monotonic increasing function of @xmath50 from these expressions , we have @xmath51 and @xmath52 for very large @xmath53 so that the reaction cross section behaves at large incident energies as@xmath54as expected from the simple argument presented in the introduction .",
    "another important possibility is that the spatial gluon distribution has an exponential tail instead of a gaussian , such as in a woods - saxon distribution . in this case",
    ", the asymptotic increase of the cross section as function of energy is expected as @xmath55 and not @xmath56 as discussed in the introduction . however , since the woods - saxon distribution has 2 parameters ( half - density radius @xmath57 and surface thickness @xmath58 ) , we use the following profile function which has exponential tail , for simplicity .",
    "@xmath59where @xmath60 is the catalan number , @xmath61the width parameter @xmath62 is related to the mean - square of the impact parameter @xmath63 as@xmath64and consequently to the radius parameter of the gaussian case as @xmath65 where @xmath66then : @xmath67where we defined the integral @xmath68where @xmath69 is given in eq.([a ] ) .",
    "we can examine the asymptotic form of this integral for large @xmath69 as follows .",
    "changing variables , @xmath70 with @xmath71 the integral above can be rewritten as @xmath72we then separate the integral into two parts : @xmath73where @xmath74 is some finite constant but sufficiently larger than unity so that @xmath75 . for large @xmath76",
    "the dominant asymptotic contribution comes from the second integral . in this",
    "integral , the second term @xmath77 may be neglected when compared to unity , and we have@xmath78therefore , the total reaction cross section at large @xmath4 behaves as@xmath79as discussed above .    in fig.1",
    ", we show the behavior of the functions @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "notice that for @xmath82 the two functions almost coincide , but for @xmath83 they behave as @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively .",
    "naturally , our simple effective dipole description will not work well for the low - energy region .",
    "however , the objective of the present work is to show the effect of possible gluon saturation inside the nuclear surface region at high energies , we just readjust slightly the parameters determined in  kowalskiea , kowalskiea2 to fit the energy dependence of the proton - proton reaction cross section  avila:2002bp , abe:1993xy , amos:1991bp , honda:1992kv , baltrusaitis:1984ka only for @xmath86 . note",
    "that the cross sections for @xmath87 are from the cosmic ray data extracted from the proton - light nuclei interactions .",
    "we can obtain reasonable fits using both gaussian and hyperbolic - secant profile functions at higher energies , as seen in fig.2 .",
    "circles are experimental data , crosses represent the result of the gaussian profile function , and open squares are the result of the @xmath88 profile function . in this energy region , both curves are similar but , as expected , the cross section for the @xmath88 profile function shows a more rapid increase in energy at higher energies than the gaussian profile case . for these calculations",
    "we have used the pdf @xmath33 from the grv98 collaboration  @xcite .",
    "for a high energy proton - nucleus collision , we may calculate the reaction cross section @xmath89 as a superposition of independent nucleon - nucleon collisions in the glauber approach .",
    "hereafter , this picture is referred to as ingp . in this picture",
    ", we have the well - known formula @xmath90where @xmath91 is the total cross section of the proton - proton collision , and @xmath92 is the transverse probability distribution function of a nucleon inside the target nucleus",
    ".    the derivation of this formula can be found in many places . here ,",
    "for later comparison , we summarize it .",
    "first , assume that the partons are confined in each nucleon of the target nucleus and , for each collisional event , nucleons are independently distributed inside the target nucleus . in this vision , for a one collisional event the incident proton sees  the target nucleus as a collection of nucleons whose center - of - mass positions are specified as @xmath93 in the transverse plane . for this event , we have the eikonal expression of the total reaction cross section@xmath94where @xmath95 is the eikonal for proton - proton collisions of impact parameter @xmath96 .    to calculate the proton - nucleus reaction cross section",
    ", we should take the average over all events .",
    "assuming that the target nucleus is an ensemble of independent nucleons whose single particle distribution is @xmath97 we can write the average over events as @xmath98where @xmath99when @xmath100 is a slowly varying function compared to the nucleon size , we can write @xmath101we identify the term @xmath102so that @xmath103where @xmath104is the transverse distribution function of a nucleon inside the nucleus .    eq.([f_non_ikonal ] ) becomes negative for @xmath105 while in eq.([f(b ) ] ) it is defined as positive definite .",
    "considering the shadowing effect , we should replace eq.([f_non_ikonal ] ) by an eikonalized expression , @xmath106from this , we have @xmath107which is nothing but eq.([glauber1 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath108we conclude that the ingp leads to a very weak energy dependence of the cross section@xmath109for large @xmath53 and eq.([sig_gauber ] ) gives essentially the geometric cross section of order @xmath110    we must remind that , in  eq.([sig_gauber ] ) the effects of finite size of nucleon and of the fluctuation were not included .",
    "in contrast to the approach above , we may consider the proton - nucleus collision process in terms of the gluon saturation inside the whole nucleus .",
    "when we go to sufficiently large energies , gluons of bounded nucleons inside a nucleus should start to superimpose and eventually fill up the nucleus as a whole . in this regime , we should then use the dipole model with gluon saturation inside the nucleus to calculate the total cross section for proton - nucleus collision .",
    "hereafter , such a scenario is referred to as gsns .",
    "the proton nucleus cross section is then @xmath111where the eikonal for the proton - nucleus reaction can be written as @xmath112 in this regime , as we discussed before the total reaction cross section increases as @xmath113 or @xmath114 depending on the form of gluon profile function near the nuclear surface which is much quicker than @xmath115 of the independent nucleon picture .",
    "therefore , the total cross section for proton - nucleus is eventually dominated by the gluon saturation process inside the nucleus .",
    "it is interesting to investigate in what energy scale such phenomena will happen and what physical parameters determine such a scale . in the independent nucleon picture ,",
    "the energy dependence of the total cross section is very weak and stays more or less at the order of the geometrical cross section , @xmath110 therefore , we conclude that the crossover energy scale should happen when @xmath116 or @xmath117 @xmath118 from eqs.([sig_analytic],[i(a ) ] ) . from fig.1 , we find that this occurs at@xmath119where @xmath69 is given in eq.([a ] ) . for large @xmath4 ,",
    "we may approximate the pdf as @xmath120the above condition gives an estimate of the energy scale for the crossover : @xmath121 ^{-\\frac{1}{\\eta } } .\\]]from this expression , we conclude that the energy scale for the gluon saturation scenario inside the target nucleus is determined essentially by the ratio @xmath122 the smaller the ratio is , the smaller the energy scale becomes .",
    "to see in practice what is the crossover energy scale for the gluon saturation inside a nucleus , we compare the calculated total reaction cross sections using the ingp and the gnsn visions .",
    "we take typical air nuclei of average @xmath123where @xmath124 .",
    "we also calculate the proton - air nuclei cross sections for the following 3 cases of different nuclear profile functions :    * gaussian , eq.([gauss ] ) substituting @xmath125 by @xmath126 * hyperbolic secant , eq.([cosh ] ) substituting @xmath125 by @xmath127 * z - integrated woods - saxon @xmath128with @xmath129 fm and normalization factor @xmath130    in fig .",
    "3 we compare the energy dependences of proton - air collision cross sections calculated for various situations : one in the ingp @xmath131 and other 3 cases of the gnsn with gaussian nuclear profile @xmath132 , gnsn with hyperbolic secant profile @xmath133 and the @xmath134integrated woods - saxon profile @xmath135 .",
    "the ingp gives almost the same cross section for all the profile function so that only one line is shown .    in these calculations ,",
    "the parameters of the model ( @xmath136 ) are those fitted to the proton - proton cross section using the gaussian profile ( see table i ) . in order to calculate the cross section in the ultra - high - energy cosmic ray domain @xmath137",
    "we have to extrapolate the pdf for small @xmath0 values . for the gaussian profile we have @xmath138 and , consequently , we fit the pdf as @xmath139for the @xmath88 case we have @xmath140 and the corresponding pdf becomes @xmath141naturally , these extrapolations contain ambiguities . however , as we are interested in obtaining a schematic description of the proton - proton cross section , these ambiguities can be absorbed in the final fitting procedure of parameters of the effective dipole model so that they will not affect our general conclusion .",
    "as expected , the gnsn scenario gives a rapid increase of the proton - nucleus cross section as a function of the incident energy and eventually overcomes the value of the ingp .",
    "it is interesting to note that all of the cross sections for different profile functions of gnsn cross the ingp estimates at the energy scale of @xmath142 this is because , once the proton cross section is fitted , the values of @xmath69 defined in eq.([a ] ) are not much different .",
    "as mentioned before , the use of the @xmath88 profile function for the gluon distribution in a proton gives a more rapid increase of the p - p cross section at larger energies compared to the gaussian profile function .",
    "when we use this type of fit to the proton - proton cross section , it naturally leads to a larger proton - nucleus cross section for the ingp , as shown in fig .",
    "however , the proton - nucleus cross section calculated in the gsns scenario stays invariant .",
    "this is because , once the pdf and effective dipole parameter are determined , the proton - nucleus cross section in this scenario depends only on the gluon distribution inside the target nucleus .",
    "one direct consequence of such effects should reflect in the behavior of the observable @xmath143 essentially the normalized depth of the position of maximum luminosity of an air - shower in the atmosphere .",
    "this observable can be affected both by the proper increase of the p - p cross section at ultra - high energy ( as in the case of the 1/cosh profile ) and also by the increase of the p - a cross section , due to the gluon saturation inside the target nucleus .",
    "the first possibility was discussed recently in @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the p - p cross section fitted by the 1/cosh profile function is very close to the upper limit used in ulrich .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "4 , this mechanism is less effective than the gnsn scenario if the ingp description is applied .    to calculate a realistic value of @xmath26",
    "we need a sophisticated simulation of the air - shower processes  seneca1,seneca2,corsika involving all the exclusive cross sections . here , just to get an idea on how the above increase of the cross section affects @xmath143 we apply a simple toy model due to heitler  @xcite to estimate the deviation of @xmath25 from these calculations which are based on the glauber description . assuming such differences of @xmath25 can be identified with the sum of differences of mean free paths calculated from the ingp and the gsns scenario as    @xmath144    where @xmath145and @xmath146 is the average nuclear mass of the air , @xmath147 and @xmath148 are cross sections calculated by the gnsn scenario and the ingp , respectively .",
    "the summation is done over the cascading steps while the energy of the leading particle is larger than the crossing energy @xmath149 from which the gluon saturation scenario overcomes the nucleon - nucleon glauber cross picture . to compare with the experimental data , we use the above toy model estimate for @xmath150 subtracting from the sibyll collaboration results for proton - air @xmath151 @xcite:@xmath152    in fig.5",
    ", we show the estimated @xmath26 values for three different profile functions ( @xmath153 gaussian,@xmath154 1/cosh , @xmath155 woods - saxson ) together with the sibyll calculations for the proton - air and fe - air simulations ( dashed lines ) and also the observed values extracted from the pierre auger observatory experiment ( black circles ) .",
    "in this paper , we have explored the idea of gluon saturation inside a nucleus in the high - energy limit and its effect on the proton - nucleus cross section .",
    "we show that if gluon saturation occurs in the surface region of the target nucleus , the proton - nucleus cross section starts to increase very rapidly as a function of the incident energy .",
    "such a mechanism should eventually happen for an ultra - high energy scale , but the question is in which energy scale such a scenario starts to dominate .",
    "such energy scale is determined by the form of the distribution of gluons near the surface area .",
    "if we assume that the small @xmath0 gluon distribution in the nucleus follows that of the nucleon wave function inside the nucleus , the energy scale where the gluon saturation scenario starts to dominate the independent nucleon picture is around @xmath156 ev .",
    "we note that different profile functions give more or less the same energy scale once the proton - proton cross section is well fitted .",
    "it is very suggestive that the gluon saturation scenario inside the surface area seems consistent with the proton primary interpretation of the observed @xmath25 behavior in the pierre auger laboratory experiment .",
    "as we see , the difference between the two pictures , ingp and gsns , becomes very large at high energies .",
    "the reason for this is that , while in the ingp the effect of virtual gluons which bound the nucleon near the surface area is completely neglected , these gluons become dominant at high energies in the gsns scenario . in a simple - minded argument",
    ", one might think that such an effect of nuclear binding must be negligible at high energies , since the ratio of the binding energy of a nucleon to the incident energy tends to zero .",
    "however , the situation may not be so simple .",
    "in the gsns scenario , the density of virtual gluons , probably forming a kind of fractal fingers when penetrating into the vacuum among nucleons similar to the electric discharge pattern , becomes higher and higher at high energies , and eventually percolate everywhere even in the nuclear surface region . according to the color glass condensate picture  @xcite , such a scenario should happen at some energy scale , even at the lowest density region of the nuclear surface .",
    "naturally , the energy scale depends on the precise form of the geometric gluon distribution inside the nucleus .",
    "if the distribution does not follow the probability distribution of nucleons but more sharp surface distribution , then the energy scale may shift to higher energy . in the example of fig . 3 and fig .",
    "4 the surface thickness parameter of the woods - saxon distribution is taken a little bit smaller than the usual value fitted to the nuclear distribution in nucleus ( @xmath157 ) since this fit only applies for heavy nuclei ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "if we take @xmath159 the energy scale is lower by one order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , the energy scale depends crucially on how the gluons starts to saturate in the nuclear surface region . depending on this",
    ", the energy scale can be even lower than estimated here . to find",
    "a real energy scale where the gluon saturation occurs at the nuclear surface , further investigation on high - energy proton - nucleus or electron - nucleus collisions will be necessary .",
    "there exist ambiguities in the proton - proton cross section used in this paper ( those of the model and extrapolation of the pdf , as well as those of experimental data ) and these affect the precise value of the energy scale .",
    "however , the general conclusion of the present work does not change , as far as the energy dependence of the proton - proton cross section is fixed .",
    "this work has been supported by faperj , capes , cnpq and pronex .",
