    "the potential experienced by the brownian particle can not , in general , be regarded as static but rather , as influenced by random fluctuations whose characteristic time scale may be comparable with the duration of the diffusion over the barrier .",
    "random effects of the environment can thus be envisioned as barrier alternating processes @xcite that can modulate the escape kinetics in the system . if the barrier fluctuates extremely slowly , the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) to the top of the barrier is dominated by those realizations for which the barrier starts in a higher position and thus becomes very long .",
    "the barrier is then essentially quasistatic throughout the process . at the other extreme , in the case of rapidly fluctuating barrier , the mean first passage time",
    "is determined by the `` average barrier '' .",
    "for some particular correlation time of the barrier fluctuations , it can happen however , that the mean kinetic rate of the process exhibits an extremum @xcite that is a signature of resonant tuning of the system in response to the external noise .    in this communication we present numerical results for the mean first passage time over a fluctuating barrier for the model system with an _ arctan _ potential barrier subject to dichotomous fluctuations .",

    "a distinctive characteristics of this model is that part of the time the barrier is either switched off ( _ i.e. _ it becomes flat ) , or the switching is performed between the barrier and a well , so that the particle can essentially roll rather than climb during these times .",
    "our major goal was to examine variability of the mean first passage time in parameter space , that is , to determine the position of its minimum ( _ cf .",
