    "subluminous stars are considered to be core helium - burning objects with a thin hydrogen shell . in a hertzsprung - russell diagram these stars are situated on the extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) .",
    "the evolution of these stars is far from understood since the formation of an sdb requires extreme mass loss at the tip of the rgb .",
    "the mechanism leading to this mass loss is still under debate @xcite .",
    "formation scenarios can be roughly divided into single star and binary channels . about 50% of the known sdbs",
    "are found to be in close binaries with periods of few hours to several days consistent with the predictions of the common envelope ( ce ) ejection scenario @xcite .",
    "two main sequence stars evolve in a binary system .",
    "the more massive one becomes a red giant first and fills its roche lobe .",
    "unstable mass transfer leads to the formation of a ce .",
    "the core of the red giant and the immersed secondary experience a loss of orbital energy which is deposited in the ce causing a spiral - in towards the center of mass .",
    "as soon as enough energy has been deposited in the envelope , it is ejected .",
    "the inwards migration stops and the stars end up in a close binary .",
    "this scenario is well suited to explain the known population of close sdb binaries .",
    "but how are the apparently single sdbs formed ?",
    "@xcite suggested that substellar companions like planets or brown dwarfs may be able to trigger ce ejection as well . in order to survive the common envelope and avoid evaporation inside the envelope",
    "the secondary should have a minimum mass of more than @xmath0 .",
    "a similar scenario has been proposed for the formation undermassive single white dwarfs by @xcite .",
    "several substellar objects have recently been detected around hot subdwarfs in wide orbits , showing that planets can survive the red giant phase of their host star @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite discovered a candidate substellar companion in close orbit around the bright sdb hd  149382 , which perfectly fits into the pattern predicted by soker .",
    "systems like that may be quite common and could have remained unnoticed up to now .",
    "the goal of our project is to put constraints on the population of the lowest mass companions to sdb stars by measuring accurate radial velocities from multi - epoch high resolution spectra .",
    "up to now our survey consists of 23 bright sdb stars with visual magnitudes ranging from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "we used high resolution spectra obtained with the feros instrument mounted at the eso / mpg-2.2 m telescope .",
    "the spectra have a resolution of @xmath3 .",
    "spectra were reduced , calibrated and corrected for earth s orbital motion with the midas package using the feros reduction pipeline .",
    "all programme stars are single - lined objects without visible spectral features of a companion . furthermore , those binaries with high radial velocity variability have been excluded because their unseen companions must be quite massive .",
    "each star has been observed several times ( from 2 to 15 ) on timescales ranging from one day to some years . as an example we display a section of the feros spectrum of hd  205805 in fig [ fig : uebers ] .",
    "subdwarf b stars are hot ( @xmath4 ) and their atmospheres radiative .",
    "the dominant features in their spectra are the hydrogen balmer and several helium lines .",
    "but the spectra also show up to @xmath5 weak metal absorption lines which are very sharp .",
    "these features are best suited to measure radial velocities .",
    "the atmospheres of sdb stars are considered to be stable .",
    "the only known effect other than a close companion that may lead to rv variability are pulsations .",
    "pulsating sdb stars do indeed exist with periods between @xmath6 and @xmath7 and rv amplitudes of few km  s@xmath8 at most @xcite .",
    "for our analysis we chose a set of sharp , unblended metal lines situated between @xmath9 and @xmath10(see fig .",
    "[ fig : fitlines ] , left hand panel ) .",
    "accurate rest wavelengths were taken from the nist database .",
    "depending on the atmospheric parameters of the star and the quality of the data a subset was used .",
    "the rv measurement consisted of two steps .",
    "first , we fitted gaussian and lorentzian profiles to each line separately using the spas routine ( hirsch priv .",
    "the resulting mean rvs had standard deviations ranging from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "second , we used the fitsb2 routine @xcite to perform a simultaneous fit of all suitable lines .",
    "uncertainties were calculated using a bootstrapping algorithm and found to range from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , while both methods result in consistent mean rvs .",
    "the scatter of individual rv values measured with spas around the mean value was reviewed for possible systematic effects like correlations with certain elements .",
    "no such effects could be found . to check the wavelength calibration for systematic errors we used telluric features as well as night - sky emission lines ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fitlines ] , right hand panel ) .",
    "having their origin on earth these lines should have zero rv .",
    "the feros instrument turned out to be very stable .",
    "usually corrections of less than @xmath14 had to be applied .    in order to derive the degree of precision we can achieve with our method , we generated synthetic model spectra with realistic atmospheric parameters including poisson noise with @xmath15 and determined the rv in the way described above .",
    "the uncertainties turned out to range from @xmath13 to @xmath16 .",
    "the accuracy is limited by the resolution of the spectrograph , the number of features and the intrinsic thermal broadening of the lines .",
    "four stars were found to be significantly ( another two marginally ) rv variable .",
    "the shift in rv ranges from @xmath17 to @xmath18 ( see tab . [ tab : a ] ) . as an example we display two rv measurements for ec  20106@xmath195248 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bigshift ] .",
    "follow - up photometry and high resolution spectroscopy are necessary to exclude pulsational variability and derive the orbital parameters of these binaries .",
    "constraints can then be put on the companion masses . even if there are no low mass companions we would expect to find a certain fraction of systems with small rv shifts caused by more massive secondaries seen at low inclination .",
    "a larger sample is needed to exclude this case .",
    ".summary of rv results for our sample obtained using two different algorithms .",
    "rvs for each line were measured independently and averaged with spas ( left hand column ) whereas fitsb2 uses a simultaneous fit ( right hand column ) . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     no rv variations were found in the rest of the sample .",
    "nevertheless , the errors allow to derive upper limits for @xmath20 of undetected substellar companions in close orbits from the binary mass function ( eq . [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that these objects should be more massive than @xmath0 and should have orbital periods shorter than @xmath22 .",
    "adopting this maximum period and assuming a canonical mass of @xmath23 for the sdb , the errors of the rv measurements can be used as upper limits for the rv semi - amplitudes ( @xmath24 ) .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : const ] , tight constraints can be put on possible substellar companions , if the measurement error is smaller than @xmath25 .",
    "given data of perfect quality , close - in planets with masses as low as @xmath26 can be firmly excluded if our assumption about the orbital period is correct .    in conclusion @xmath27 of the apparently single stars in our sample show small rv variations .",
    "the true fraction is expected to be higher , because the accuracy is limited by the s / n in most cases .",
    "companions with masses higher than @xmath0 in close orbits ( @xmath28 ) can be excluded for @xmath29 of our sample .",
    "one possible explanation for the fractions found is that the assumed ce scenario is not the only channel for sdb formation .",
    "however , even with ce ejection being the only channel , the companion may be destroyed during the ce phase either by evaporation or a merger with the stellar core leaving behind a single sdb .",
    "better statistics and reliable predictions from theoretical calculations are required to solve this problem .",
