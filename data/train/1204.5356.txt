    "the vast amount of data collected at the relativistic heavy ion collider at brookhaven national laboratory along with those recently collected from the collision of lead nuclei at large hadron collider at cern have led to the momentous discovery of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "a large part of the effort in the coming years will be devoted to the determination of the precise values of the transport properties of the qgp . in this context , the energy loss suffered by quarks of different flavours and gluons as they traverse the qgp , undergoing collisions and radiating gluons , is a subject matter of considerable topical interest .",
    "it is most simply demonstrated by a suppressed production of hadrons having large transverse momenta in nucleus - nucleus collisions when compared to appropriately scaled productions in @xmath3 collisions at the same centre of mass energy per nucleon .",
    "it is often suggested that heavy quarks may lose a smaller amount of energy per unit length during their passage through qgp compared to light quarks , due to the dead cone effect  @xcite .",
    "the experimental results , however , show similar suppression for light and heavy mesons  @xcite . a recent calculation by abir et al  @xcite incorporating",
    "the generalized distribution of gluons in @xmath4 and @xmath5 processes with a proper accounting of mass of the heavy quarks , leads to a @xmath6 for charm quarks which is quite similar to those for light quarks at energies @xmath7 10 - 15 gev .",
    "the study of charm quark energy loss provides several unique advantages over those of light partons .",
    "the charm mesons easily stand out in the multitude of light mesons .",
    "most of the charm quarks are produced in initial fusion of quarks and anti - quarks ( @xmath8 ) and gluons ( @xmath9 ) , though a small additional production is expected  @xcite from multiple scattering between jets , jets and thermalized partons , and thermalized partons .",
    "it is not yet clearly established if the charm quarks thermalize in the qgp  @xcite , though it is expected that due to their small numbers their impact on the bulk properties of the qgp would be negligible .",
    "one also expects that due to their large mass , charm quarks will not change their direction as they traverse the plasma , though they will slow down , making them excellent probes of azimuthal dependence of the conditions of the interacting system . as charm quarks have large mass",
    ", pqcd remains reasonably valid down to lowest @xmath2 .",
    "there is one additional trait which should help us in getting flavour dependence of energy loss of heavy quarks . while a @xmath10 or a @xmath11 or a @xmath12 quark or a gluon can fragment into one of many mesons or baryons , a charm or a bottom quark would mostly fragment into only a @xmath13 or a @xmath14 meson or a charm or bottom baryon , respectively .",
    "thus a charm quark after losing energy will appear as a d - meson having lower energy .",
    "we shall see that this would lead to a characteristic enhancement of charm mesons or single electrons at low @xmath2 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "2 contains expressions for calculations of nuclear modification factor- @xmath15 , azimuthal anisotropy coefficient- @xmath16 , charm production , and our model prescription for energy loss .",
    "contains discussion of our results , followed by a summary in sec .",
    "the energy loss of quarks and gluons is most easily seen via the suppressed production of hadrons measured using nuclear modification factor , @xmath15 :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the hadron production for the nucleus - nucleus system at a given impact parameter , @xmath19 is the corresponding nuclear thickness , and @xmath20 is the cross - section for the production of hadrons at the corresponding centre of mass energy / nucleon in @xmath3 collisions",
    ".    one can now calculate @xmath21 /(1+\\delta_{ij})~",
    ", \\label{sigma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the momenta and rapidities of produced charm and anti - charm and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the fractions of the momenta carried by the partons from their interacting parent hadrons .",
    "these are given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the transverse mass , @xmath28 , of the produced heavy quark .",
    "the subscripts @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the interacting partons , and @xmath31 are the partonic distribution functions for the nucleons .",
    "the fundamental processes included for lo calculations are :    @xmath32    we recall that the above lo pqcd expression reproduces the nlo results  @xcite when supplemented with a @xmath33-factor @xmath34 2 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we have used @xmath19= 225 @xmath35 for 0 - 10@xmath36 centrality for au+au collisions at rhic , as calculated from glauber formalism . for",
    "pb+pb collisions at lhc , @xmath19 = 195 @xmath35 for 0 - 20@xmath36 centrality has been used .",
    "we use cteq5 m structure function along with eks98  @xcite shadowing function .",
    "the factorization , renormalization , and fragmentation scales are chosen as @xmath37 and the charm quark mass has been taken as 1.5 gev .",
    "we propose an empirical model for the energy loss for charm quarks which is inspired by a multiple scattering model used earlier by  @xcite supplemented with considerations of baier et al  @xcite for partonic energy loss  @xcite .",
    "a straight - forward empirical implementation of a similar energy loss procedure for light parton has been found to provide a satisfactory dependence of energy loss on the centralitiy of the collision  @xcite .",
    "we recall once again that the nuclear modification of heavy meson production is similar to those for light mesons .",
    "we perform a monte carlo implementation of our model calculations and estimate the momentum loss of charm quarks and nuclear modification of d - meson and single electron production .",
    "we assume that the energy loss of heavy quarks proceeds via multiple collisions and that the momentum loss per collision is given by , ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath38 so that one can write @xmath39 where @xmath1 and @xmath40 are parameters to be determined and @xmath41 is the mean free path of the charm quark , taken as 1 fm , in these initial studies . in what follows",
    ", we shall consider charm quarks at central rapidities and thus @xmath42 .",
    "thus the momentum of the charm quark after @xmath43 collisions will be given by @xmath44 the charm quark can continue to lose energy in collisions as long as the resulting momentum remains positive .",
    "we estimate the probability for the charm quark to have @xmath43 collisions , while covering the path length @xmath45 from a poisson distribution @xmath46    taking a value for the coefficient @xmath1 and the exponent @xmath40 , we estimate the largest number of collisions- @xmath47 , which the charm quark having momentum @xmath2 can undergo .",
    "next we sample the number of collisions @xmath43 , which the charm undergoes from the distribution @xmath48 to get the final momentum of the charm quark .",
    "finally we fragment the charm quarks into d - mesons .",
    "thus we have , @xmath49 where the fragmentation of the heavy quark @xmath50 into the heavy - meson @xmath51 is described by the fragmentation function @xmath13 .",
    "we have assumed that the shape of @xmath52 , where @xmath53 , is identical for all the @xmath13-mesons ,  @xcite and @xmath54 ^ 2}~ , \\label{frag}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the peterson parameter and @xmath56 we have kept it fixed at @xmath55=0.13 .",
    "here @xmath57 denotes semileptonic decay of @xmath13-mesons and the electron distribution is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "non - central collisions of identical nuclei will lead to an oval overlap zone , whose length in and out of the reaction plain would be different .",
    "thus , charm quarks traversing the qgp in and out of the plain will cover different path lengths and lose differing amount of energy .",
    "this would lead to an azimuthal dependence in the distribution of resulting charm mesons , whose azimuthal anisotropy could be measured in terms of the @xmath16 coefficient defined by @xmath58 we have approximated the colliding nuclei as having a uniform density with radius @xmath59 in these calculations and obtained average path - length for the charm quarks along a given @xmath60 using eq .",
    "9 of ref .",
    "let us now discuss our results for nuclear modification factor and azimuthal anisotropy .",
    "we consider three values for the exponent @xmath40 ; 0 , 0.5 , 1.0 appearing in eq .",
    "[ deltapt ] , inspired by the three energy loss mechanisms , namely those applicable in the so - called bethe - heitler regime , lpm regime , and complete coherence regimes considered by baier et al .",
    "@xcite which lead to energy loss per unit length as proportional to energy , square - root of the energy , and independent of the energy for light partons .",
    "kampfer et al  @xcite had earlier used this approach to study the effect of charm quark energy loss on the correlated charm decay .",
    "next we vary @xmath1 to get a description of the @xmath15 for single electrons at rhic ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and for @xmath13-mesons at lhc ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show our results for nuclear modification factor @xmath15 and azimuthal anisotropy @xmath16 for non photonic electrons at top rhic energy @xmath61 = 200 a gev  @xcite . comparing the results of figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we see that the model assuming momentum loss per collision as proportional to the momentum closely follows the shape of the experimentally determined @xmath15 for single electrons almost over the entire range of @xmath2 under consideration .",
    "we add that our theoretical calculations have not included the @xmath62 contribution which is contained in the experimental results which can modify the @xmath15 for larger @xmath2 by up to 10% as the produced @xmath63 quarks",
    "are much less in number and also lose much smaller energy  @xcite .",
    "the scenario , where @xmath64 , is only moderately successful in describing the data over a limited @xmath2 range of 24 gev/@xmath65 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "while the assumption of a constant momentum loss per collision may bracket the @xmath15 over the very limited range of 23 gev/@xmath65 , it does not follow the shape of the @xmath2 dependence ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the best values of the @xmath1 determined from the results in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are used to estimate @xmath16 for the single electrons .",
    "we see that our calculations provide a reasonable description of @xmath66 for @xmath67 2 gev/@xmath65 and overestimate the results for lower @xmath2 .",
    "a relaxation of our assumption of a static medium at a constant temperature and a uniform density of the nuclei may improve this agreement .",
    "similar results are obtained when we apply the model to the @xmath15 measured  @xcite for the @xmath13-mesons at the lhc ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we again see that the model using @xmath68 provides a good description of the data over the entire @xmath2 range , while that using @xmath64 seems to describe the data for @xmath67 4 gev/@xmath65 .",
    "the constant momentum transfer collision misses the shape of the @xmath2 distribution completely though it is able to bracket the numerical values over a very narrow @xmath2 range of 35 gev/@xmath65 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the predictions for @xmath16 are given for a ready reference .",
    "several factors could affect the value of the energy loss coefficient @xmath1 for a given mechanism .",
    "we have verified that increasing ( decreasing ) the mean free path , @xmath41 , by 0.5 fm results in a decrease ( increase ) of the coefficient , @xmath69 such that @xmath70 remains unaltered .",
    "we have kept @xmath71 fixed at 0.3 while estimating the initial charm distribution .",
    "taking the renormalization scale as @xmath72 , with @xmath73= 1 or 2 leads to a decrease in the value of @xmath15 by 7 - 10 % , which can then be offset by decreasing @xmath69 by about 12 % .",
    "it is interesting to recall that a focker - planck equation given by @xmath74~ , \\label{focker}\\ ] ] describes the evolution of the distribution @xmath75 , of charm quarks propagating in quark gluon plasma  @xcite and losing energy due to multiple soft scatterings with light quarks and gluons .",
    "this leads to a drag , @xmath76 , and a diffusion @xmath77 on the momentum of the charm quark . assuming that @xmath76 depends on momentum only , we have @xmath78 and the energy loss @xmath6 can be related to drag coefficient @xmath79 by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the energy of the charm quark , and @xmath82 its momentum . considering the average temperature of the plasma attained at rhic as @xmath34 220 mev  @xcite",
    ", we can read the drag coefficient from fig .",
    "3(a ) of ref .",
    "@xcite as @xmath34 0.02 @xmath83 for @xmath2 up to 5 gev/@xmath65 .",
    "we can re - write the above equation as @xmath84 comparing this with one of the ansatzes used for energy loss per collision in the present work , namely @xmath85 , we can write that @xmath86 thus the effective drag coefficient @xmath87 , can be written as @xmath88 which reduces to @xmath70 for large values of @xmath82    we thus note that the effective drag at rhic energies is about 0.04 @xmath83 compared to 0.02 @xmath83 estimated for soft multiple collisions by authors of ref .",
    "thus we conclude that at rhic energies only half of the energy loss could be due to collisions , while the other half could attributed to radiations of gluons . similarly estimating the average temperature at lhc as about 270 mev and using the results for drag due to collisions as @xmath340.04 @xmath83 from ref .",
    "@xcite at high momentum , we note that the collisions account for only one - third of energy loss at 2.76 tev / nucleon .",
    "it is of interest to compare our results with other studies on medium modification of charm propagation reported in the literature .",
    "thus moore and teaney  @xcite have calculated the diffusion @xmath13 and drag coefficient @xmath89 , ( denoted by @xmath90 here ) using lo pqcd as @xmath91 and @xmath92 taking @xmath930.3 , this provides @xmath940.06 @xmath83 at 220 mev and @xmath940.09 @xmath83 at 270 mev , which are larger than our values at rhic and smaller than those at 2.76 tev / nucleon at lhc .",
    "recall however , the results of bass et al .  @xcite that a description of medium modification as well as @xmath16 for single electrons at rhic brackets the diffusion coefficient @xmath13 between @xmath95 and @xmath96 , when flow and contributions of bottom electrons is included .",
    "this provides a large value for the drag coefficient between 0.17 and 0.68 @xmath83 . at first these large values",
    "may look surprising .",
    "however from eq .",
    "[ dmoore ] we see that these would correspond to values of @xmath71 between @xmath341.0 and @xmath340.5 , which are rather large and make the use of perturbative qcd questionable .    in this connection the studies of gossiaux",
    "et al  @xcite , are also of considerable interest which suggest that the collisional energy loss could be substantially larger if the debye mass is replaced by hard thermal loop calculation and a running coupling constant is used .",
    "we further recall the work of authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , which suggests that a considerable drag could be produced by the resonant heavy quark - light quark interaction , beyond that determined by lo pqcd interactions .",
    "we have already mentioned that @xmath65 quarks will materialize mostly as @xmath13-mesons .",
    "this can have an interesting consequence which is already apparent in the figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "the @xmath65 quarks after losing energy will pile up at lower energies and this would result in a characteristic increase in the production of @xmath13-mesons as well as single electrons having lower transverse momenta ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "we note that while there is suppression by almost a factor of 24 depending on the incident energy ( for single electrons ) at larger @xmath2 , there is essentially no suppression at lower @xmath2 at rhic and even an increase by a few percent at lhc where the energy loss is higher and the momentum spectra of @xmath65 quarks have less steeper slopes .",
    "the increase in the case of @xmath13-mesons at lhc is rather spectacular .",
    "this is different from the normal enhancement of mesons having low @xmath2 due to the so - called cronin effect , which is expected to be less important at higher incident energies and heavy mesons ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "we recall that a similar enhancement in d - meson production at low @xmath2 has been predicted by considering the drag suffered the heavy quarks in the plasma and during their hadronization  @xcite . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we shall show that this can lead to a slight increase in the production of low mass dileptons due to correlated charm decay  @xcite .    at the very minimum",
    "the present work describes a simple procedure to implement energy loss of heavy quarks in relativistic collision of heavy nuclei .",
    "it will be of interest to explore the energy and centrality dependence of the momentum loss coefficient @xmath1 .",
    "we have used a simple model where charm quarks traversing qgp lose energy in multiple collisions . exploring different parametric forms of energy loss we find that the form where the momentum loss per collision is proportional to the momentum gives a good description of nuclear modification of single electron production at rhic and d - meson production at lhc . comparing our results with drag coefficients due to collisional energy loss calculated earlier , we find that only a part of the energy loss could be due to collisions .",
    "we note a characteristic increase in production of single electrons and d - mesons having low momenta due to energy loss of charms having larger energy .",
