    "ever since the proposition of the `` demon '' by maxwell @xcite , numerous studies have been conducted on the consistency between the role of the demon and the second law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "bennett resolved the apparent contradiction by considering the logically irreversible initialization of the demon @xcite .",
    "the key observation here is the so - called landauer principle @xcite which states that , in erasing one bit of information from the demon s memory , at least @xmath0 of heat should , on average , be dissipated into the environment with the same amount of work being performed on the demon .",
    "piechocinska has proved this principle without invoking the second law in an isothermal process @xcite .",
    "the essence of consistency between the role of the demon and the second law of thermodynamics can be illustrated by the setup of the szilard engine @xcite .",
    "suppose that the entire state of the szilard engine and the demon is initially in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the demon gains one bit of information on the state of the szilard engine . the engine performs just @xmath0 of work by using this information , before returning to the initial state .",
    "the demon then erases the obtained information from its memory .",
    "consequently , the entire state returns to the initial equilibrium state .",
    "the sum of the work performed on the engine and the demon in a full cycle of the szilard engine is non - negative according to the landauer principle ; thus the szilard engine is consistent with the second law in this situation .",
    "however , the landauer principle stated above tells us nothing if the demon is far from equilibrium in the initial and/or final states .",
    "further discussions on maxwell s demon involve quantum - mechanical aspects of the demon @xcite , and general relationships between the entropy and action of the demon from a quantum information - theoretic point of view @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the relationship between the work ( or heat ) and action of the demon is not yet fully understood from this viewpoint .",
    "we stress that @xmath1 is not valid in a general thermodynamic process .",
    "jarzynski has proved an irreversible - thermodynamic equality which relates the work to the free energy difference in an arbitrary isothermal process @xcite : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the work done on the system , @xmath5 is the difference in the helmholtz free energy between the initial and final states , and @xmath6 is the statistical average over all microscopic paths .",
    "note that this equality is satisfied even when the external parameters are changed at a finite rate .",
    "it follows from this equality that the fundamental inequality @xmath7 holds . while the original jarzynski equality is classical , quantum - mechanical versions of the jarzynski equality",
    "have been studied @xcite .",
    "kim and qian have recently generalized the equality for a classical langevin system which is continuously controlled by a maxwell s demon @xcite .    in this paper , we establish a general relationship between the work performed on a thermodynamic system and the amount of information gained from it by the demon , and prove the relevant equality and several corollary inequalities which are generalizations of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) . with the present setup ,",
    "the demon performs a quantum measurement @xcite during an isothermal process , selects a sub - ensemble according to the outcome of the measurement , and performs unitary transformations on the system depending on the outcome .",
    "we follow the method of ref .",
    "@xcite to characterize the demon only in terms of its action on the system and do not make any assumption about the state of the demon itself .",
    "the subsequent results therefore hold true regardless of the state of the demon , be it in equilibrium or out of equilibrium .",
    "this paper is constituted as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we formulate a general setup of isothermal processes with maxwell s demon and illustrate the case of a generalized szilard engine . in sec .",
    "iii , we derive the generalized jarzynski equality , and new thermodynamic equalities generalizing inequality  ( [ 1 ] ) . in sec .",
    "iv a , we clarify the property of an effective information content obtained by the demon s measurement . in sec .",
    "iv b , we discuss a crucial assumption of the final state of thermodynamic processes , which sheds light on a fundamental aspect of the characterization of thermodynamic equilibrium states . finally , in sec .",
    "vii , we conclude this paper .",
    "we consider an isothermal process at temperature @xmath8 , in which a thermodynamic system is in contact with an environment at the same temperature , and in which the initial and final states of the entire system are in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "we do not , however , assume that the states in the course of the process are in thermodynamic equilibrium . we treat the isothermal process as the evolution of thermodynamic system s and sufficiently large heat bath b , which are as a whole isolated and",
    "only come into contact with some external mechanical systems and a demon . apart from the demon",
    ", the total hamiltonian can be written as @xmath9 where the time dependence of @xmath10 describes the mechanical operation on s through certain external parameters , such as an applied magnetic field or volume of the gas , and the time dependence of @xmath11 describes , for example , the attachment of an adiabatic wall to s. we consider a time evolution from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , assume @xmath14 , and write @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we consider the simplest isothermal process in the presence of the demon .",
    "this process can be divides into the following five stages :    _ stage 1._at time @xmath12 , the initial state of s+b is in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath17 .",
    "the density operator of the entire state is given by @xmath18 note that the partition function of s+b is the product of that of s and that of b : @xmath19 , and the helmholtz free energy of s+b is the sum @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , etc .",
    "_ stage 2._from @xmath12 to @xmath22 , system s+b evolves according to the unitary transformation represented by @xmath23    _ stage 3._from @xmath22 to @xmath24 , a demon performs a quantum measurement described by measurement operators @xmath25 on s and obtains each outcome @xmath26 with probability @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath28 be the set of all the outcomes @xmath26 satisfying @xmath29 .",
    "suppose that the number of elements in @xmath28 is finite .",
    "the process proceeds to _ stage 4 _ only if the outcome belongs to subset @xmath30 of @xmath28 , otherwise the demon discards the sample and the process restarts from _ stage 1 _ ; we calculate the statistical average over subensemble @xmath30 .",
    "_ stage 4._from @xmath24 to @xmath31 , the demon performs a mechanical operation on s depending on outcome @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath32 be the corresponding unitary operator on s+b .",
    "we assume that the state of the system becomes independent of @xmath26 at the end of this stage , this being a feature characterizing the action of the demon @xcite .",
    "this stage describes a feedback control by the demon .",
    "note that the action of the demon is characterized only by set @xmath33 .",
    "_ stage 5._from @xmath31 to @xmath13 , s+b evolves according to unitary operator @xmath34 which is independent of outcome @xmath26 .",
    "we assume that s+b has reached equilibrium at temperature @xmath17 by @xmath13 from the macroscopic point of view because the degrees of freedom of b is assumed to far exceed that of s. the partition function of the final hamiltonian is then given by @xmath35 as in _ stage 1 _ , it follows that @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 .",
    "we denote as @xmath39 the density operator of the final state .    after going through all the stages ,",
    "the state of the system changes from @xmath40 to @xmath41 where @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the sum of the probabilities of @xmath26 s belonging to @xmath30 as @xmath45 note that @xmath42 is a nonunitary operator because it involves the action of measurement by the demon .",
    "in contrast , in the original setup of jarzynski , there is no demon and hence @xmath42 is unitary .    in the case of a generalized szilard engine ,",
    "the foregoing general process can be illustrated as follows .",
    "we use a box containing a single molecule localized in a region that is sufficiently smaller than the box .",
    "this molecule interacts with a heat bath at temperature @xmath17 .     and @xmath46",
    ". the conventional szilard engine corresponds to @xmath47 .",
    "_ stage 1._the state of the engine and the heat bath is initially in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "_ stage 2._divide the box into 5 partitions .",
    "_ stage 3._a demon measures which partition the molecule is in .",
    "this measurement is described by measurement operators @xmath48 . _",
    "stage 4._the demon performs operation @xmath32 depending on measurement outcome @xmath26 . if @xmath49 , @xmath50 or @xmath51 , the demon moves the @xmath26th box to the leftmost position . if the outcome is 4 or 5 , the demon discards the sample and the process restarts from _",
    "stage 1_. _ stage 5._the box is expanded quasi - statically and isothermally so that the final state of the entire system returns to the initial state from a macroscopic point of view .",
    "this process is a unitary evolution of the entire system .",
    "see the text for details . ]    _ stage 1._a molecule is initially in equilibrium at temperature @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath40 be the density operator of the initial state of the engine and the heat bath .",
    "_ stage 2._we divide the box into @xmath52 partitions of equal volume .",
    "the state of the molecule then becomes @xmath53 , where @xmath54 represents the state of the molecule in the @xmath26th partition .",
    "we set @xmath55 .",
    "_ stage 3._a demon performs a measurement on the system to find out where the molecule is .",
    "the demon chooses subset @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) , and the process proceeds to _ stage 4 _ only if outcome @xmath26 belongs to @xmath30 .",
    "the state of the system is @xmath58 at the end of this stage .",
    "_ stage 4._when the outcome is @xmath26 ( @xmath59 ) , the demon removes all but the @xmath26th box , and then moves the @xmath26th box to the leftmost position .",
    "this operation is described by @xmath32 .",
    "the state of the molecule after this operation is @xmath60 .",
    "_ stage 5._we expand the box quasi - statically and isothermally so that the final state of the entire system returns to the initial state from a macroscopic point of view . here by the last sentence we mean that the expectation value of any macroscopic quantity in the final state is the same as that in the initial state , as will be discussed in detail in sec .",
    "iv b. this process is unitary in respect of the molecule and heat bath ; we can thus describe this process by unitary operator @xmath34 .",
    "figure [ figure1 ] illustrates these processes for the case of @xmath61 and @xmath46 .",
    "when @xmath47 , this process is equivalent to the conventional szilard engine .",
    "let us now prove the equality which constitutes the main result of this paper .",
    "let @xmath4 be the work performed on s+b during the entire process , @xmath62 and @xmath63 be the respective eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath64 , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 the respective eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath67 .",
    "we can then calculate the statistical average @xcite of @xmath68 over the subensemble specified by condition @xmath69 as @xmath70 where @xmath44 is given by eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) . making the polar decomposition of @xmath71 as @xmath72 , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is a unitary operator",
    ", we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the density operator of the canonical distribution of the final hamiltonian : @xmath77 let @xmath78 be the density operator just before the measurement , and @xmath79 be that immediately after the measurement with outcome @xmath26 .",
    "we obtain @xmath80 and @xmath81 ; therefore @xmath82 thus eq .  (",
    "[ 10 ] ) reduces to @xmath83 where we introduced the notation @xmath84 the parameter @xmath85 describes the measurement error of the demon s measurement , the precise meaning of which is discussed in sec . v. we now _ assume _ that the final state @xmath39 satisfies @xmath86 we discuss in detail the physical meaning and validity of this assumption in sec .",
    "iv b. note that if the density operator of the final state is the canonical distribution , i.e. @xmath87 , then the above assumption  ( [ assumption ] ) is trivially satisfied . under this assumption ,",
    "we finally obtain @xmath88 where @xmath89 .",
    "this is the main result of this paper .    in a special case in which @xmath90 s are projection operators for all @xmath26 , and @xmath91 , eq .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) reduces to @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the number of elements in @xmath28 .",
    "note that the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) is independent of the details of pre - measurement state @xmath78 .",
    "we can apply the generalized jarzynski equality to prove an inequality .",
    "it follows from the concavity of the exponential function that @xmath94 we therefore obtain @xmath95    consider the case in which the demon selects single outcome @xmath26 , that is @xmath96 .",
    "equation  ( [ 9 ] ) then reduces to @xmath97 , where @xmath98 , and inequality ( [ 16 ] ) becomes @xmath99 averaging inequality ( [ 18 ] ) over all @xmath100 , we obtain @xmath101 where @xmath102 describes an effective information content which the demon gains about the system . inequality ( [ 19 ] ) is a generalization of ( [ 1 ] ) and is stronger than ( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "it shows that we can extract work larger than @xmath103 from a single heat bath in the presence of the demon , but that we _ can not _",
    "extract work larger than @xmath104 .",
    "we discuss the physical meaning of @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "it can easily be shown that @xmath107 here @xmath108 for all @xmath78 if and only if @xmath90 is proportional to the identity operator , and @xmath109 for all @xmath78 if and only if @xmath90 is a projection operator . in the former case",
    ", the demon can gain no information about the system , while in the latter case , the measurement is error - free",
    ". let us consider the case of @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are projection operators and @xmath114 is a small positive number .",
    "then @xmath105 is given by @xmath115 we can therefore say that @xmath116 is a measure of distance between @xmath90 and the projection operator .",
    "it follows from ( [ 21 ] ) that @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the shannon information content that the demon obtains : @xmath119 .",
    "we now derive some special versions of inequality ( [ 19 ] ) .",
    "if the demon does not get information ( i.e. , @xmath120 ) , inequality ( [ 19 ] ) becomes @xmath121 , which is simply inequality ( [ 1 ] ) . on the other hand , in the case of a projection measurement , where @xmath122 , ( [ 19 ] ) becomes @xmath123 .",
    "an inequality similar ( but not equivalent ) to this inequality has been proved by kim and qian for a classical langevin system @xcite .",
    "we next show the physical validity of the assumption  ( [ assumption ] ) .    in general",
    ", the canonical distribution describes the properties of thermodynamic equilibrium states .",
    "however , the thermodynamic equilibrium is a macroscopic property characterized only by the expectation values of macroscopic quantities .",
    "in fact , to show that a heat bath is in thermodynamic equilibrium , we do not observe each molecule , but observe only macroscopic quantities of the heat bath , for example the center of mass of a `` small '' fraction involving a large number ( e.g. @xmath124 ) of molecules .",
    "thus a density operator corresponding to a thermodynamic equilibrium state is _ not _ necessarily the rigorous canonical distribution ; @xmath87 is too strong an assumption .",
    "note that no assumption has been made on the final state @xmath39 in the derivation of the original jarzynski equality without maxwell s demon  @xcite , so @xmath2 holds for any final state @xmath39 . under the condition that the final state of s+b is in thermodynamic equilibrium corresponding to the free energy @xmath125 from a macroscopic point of view",
    ", we can interpret inequality  ( [ 1 ] ) , which can be shown from the jarzynski equality , as the thermodynamic inequality for a transition between two thermodynamic equilibrium states , even if @xmath39 is not a rigorous canonical distribution .",
    "on the other hand , we have required the supplementary assumption  ( [ assumption ] ) for the final state @xmath39 to prove the generalized jarzynski equality with maxwell s demon .",
    "the assumption  ( [ assumption ] ) holds if @xmath126 for all @xmath26 in @xmath30 , where @xmath127 .",
    "we can say that under the assumption  ( [ assumption ] ) , @xmath39 is restricted not only in terms of macroscopic quantities , but also constrained so as to meet eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) .",
    "it appears that the latter constraint is connected with the fact that the system in state @xmath39 and that in state @xmath76 should not be distinguished by the demon .",
    "we stress that our assumption  ( [ assumption ] ) is extremely weak compared with the assumption @xmath87 . to see this , we denote as @xmath128 the degree of freedom of s+b ( e.g. @xmath129 ) , as @xmath130 the dimension of the hilbert space corresponding to s+b , and as @xmath131 the number of elements in @xmath30 .",
    "we can easily show that @xmath132 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath133 holds in a situation that the role of the demon is experimentally realizable . for example , suppose that s is a spin-1 system and b consists of harmonic oscillators , and the demon made up from optical devices performs a projection measurement on s. in this case , @xmath134 and @xmath135 . the rigorous equality @xmath87 holds , in general , if and only if all the matrix elements in @xmath39 coincides with that of @xmath76 , and note that the number of independent real valuables in the density operators is @xmath136 .",
    "on the other hand , only @xmath131 equalities in  ( [ a ] ) are required to meet the assumption @xmath137 .",
    "although it is a conjecture that the assumption  ( [ assumption ] ) is virtually realized in real physical situations , we believe that it is indeed realized in many situations . a more detailed analysis on the assumption  ( [ assumption ] ) is needed to understand the concept of thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "finally , we consider the case that the assumption  ( [ assumption ] ) is not satisfied and @xmath138 holds for all @xmath26 in @xmath30 .",
    "we can then estimate the value of @xmath139 as @xmath140 thus the deviation from the generalized jarzynski equation is bounded only by the difference on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have generalized the jarzynski equality to a situation involving maxwell s demon and derived several inequalities in thermodynamic systems .",
    "the demon in our formulation performs a quantum measurement and a unitary transformation depending on the outcome of the measurement .",
    "independent of the state of the demon , however , our equality  ( [ 17 ] ) establishes a close connection between the work and the information which can be extracted from a thermodynamic system , and our inequality  ( [ 19 ] ) shows that one can extract from a single heat bath work greater than @xmath103 due to an effective information content that the demon gains about the system . to analyze broader aspects of information",
