    "the primary goals of multiwavelength analyses are to understand the physical origin of prompt and afterglow emission , to challenge current theoretical models , to determine the nature of the expanding fireball and the role played by magnetic fields in driving the explosion .",
    "the combination of @xmath1-ray , x - ray , optical and ultraviolet data from _ swift _ instruments with deep , early - time optical imaging from rapid - response ground - based robotic telescopes , such as the faulkes and liverpool telescopes , as well as later - time observations with 4- and 8-m class telescopes has provided unprecedented datasets for the investigation of grb physics .    here",
    "we present a detailed analysis of a set of multiwavelength observations of _ swift _ grb  061126 comprising @xmath1-ray , x - ray , ultraviolet and optical observations from ground- and space - based telescopes that observed the initial prompt emission and early afterglow through to the late stages of the fading afterglow , 15@xmath520 days after the burst . following the detection of grb  061126 by _",
    "swift s _ burst alert telescope ( bat ) , several ground - based telescopes ( raptor - s , super - lotis , nmsu-1 m telescope , pairitel , faulkes telescope north , kait , and 0.3-m telescope at new mexico skies observatory ) reacted promptly to the bat trigger and detected a bright optical and nir afterglow , with detections being obtained in the first tens to hundreds of seconds after the burst .",
    "the _ swift _ satellite did not slew immediately to the burst location because of the earth limb constraint .",
    "therefore , observations with the narrow field instruments , the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) and the uv / optical telescope ( uvot ) , began 26 minutes after the trigger .",
    "an associated host galaxy was detected @xcite with a redshift @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the optical afterglow of grb  061126 shows a steep - to - flat transition at @xmath713  min after the trigger .",
    "similar flattening has been observed in optical afterglows of grb  990123 @xcite , grb  021211 @xcite , grb  060117 @xcite , and grb  080319b @xcite .",
    "particularly , the grb  021211 occurred at a similar redshift ( @xmath8 , * ? ? ? * ) and was linked with a possible supernova @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the early , steep afterglow was interpreted as due to emission from the reverse shock dominating the light curve , while the later , more slowly fading component as due to the forward shock @xcite .",
    "some of these bursts have also shed light on the issue of magnetization of the fireball .",
    "it is shown that at the deceleration of a fireball ejecta , the microscopic parameter @xmath9 in the ejecta should be much larger than in the forward shock in the case of grb  990123 and possibly grb  021211 @xcite .    with its steep - to - shallow optical light curve behavior , grb  061126",
    "offers a valuable opportunity to investigate the multiwavelength prompt and afterglow properties of a grb with a prominent reverse shock component , which is not always present in light curves of grbs with bright optical counterparts @xcite .",
    "observations and data reduction are presented in  2 ; the derived temporal and spectral characteristics of the burst are presented in  3 , and in  4 we present and discuss a reverse and forward shock model , implications for the standard model and the magnetization of the fireball .    throughout this paper",

    "bat triggered and localized grb  061126 ( bat trigger 240766 ) on 2006 nov 26 , at 08:47:56 ut @xcite .",
    "we refer to this time as @xmath16 throughout the paper .",
    "this was a 1.024 s rate - trigger on a long burst with @xmath0  s. the bat light curve in different energy bands is shown in figure  [ fig : gammalc ] .",
    "bat data were obtained in the burst mode , covering @xmath17  s to @xmath18  s @xcite and were processed using the heasoft software package , version 6.1.2 and version 2.6 of the calibration database , applying calibration , standard filtering and screening criteria .",
    "we extracted the mask - tagged light curves ( figures  [ fig : gammalc ] and [ fig : gammatail ] ) with a binning time of 64  ms in the four nominal energy bands adopting the ground - refined coordinates provided by the bat team @xcite .",
    "we applied the energy calibration using the closest - in - time gain / offset file through the tool bateconvert .",
    "the light curves are expressed as count rates : these are background - subtracted counts per second per fully illuminated detector for an equivalent on - axis source , as the default corrections are applied : ndets , pcode , maskwt , flatfield .",
    "we extracted the mask weighted spectrum from @xmath19  s to @xmath20  s using the tool batbinevt .",
    "all required corrections were applied : we updated it through batupdatephakw and generated the detector response matrix using batdrmgen .",
    "we then used batphasyserr to account for the bat systematics as a function of energy .",
    "finally we grouped the energy channels of the spectrum by imposing a 5-@xmath21 threshold on each grouped channel .",
    "the spectrum ( figure  [ fig : gammaour ] ) was fit with xspec11.3 .",
    "xrt began observing the burst at 09:14:31 ut , i.e. at @xmath22  s , and monitored the source until 2006 december 28 at 23:59:57 ut for a total of 29 observation sequences .",
    "xrt data were processed using the heasoft package .",
    "the xrt exposure times after all the cleaning procedures were 203 s in window timing mode ( wt ) and 271 ks in photon counting mode ( pc ) , distributed over a time interval of 32 days .",
    "pc data from the first sequence were corrected for pile - up , caused by the relatively high count rate of the source .",
    "the xrt light curve ( figure  [ fig : lc ] ) was extracted requiring a minimum signal - to - noise ratio of 3 .",

    "data in three time intervals : wt data from the first sequence ( from @xmath26  s to @xmath27  s ) , pc data from the first sequence ( from @xmath27  s to @xmath28  s ) and pc data from sequences 2 - 7 ( from @xmath28  s to @xmath23  ks ) , were fitted with an absorbed power - law model using xspec version 11.3 .",
    "instrumental energy channels below 0.3  kev and above 10  kev for pc and wt spectra were ignored .",
    "data were binned with a requirement of a minimum of 20 photons per bin .",
    "auxiliary response files and exposure maps were created using the heasoft software for each segment , and the appropriate response matrixes from the caldb were applied .",
    "the uvot began observing the field of the grb  061126 at @xmath29  s. observations started with a 9  s settling exposure in @xmath30-filter , followed by a 100  s exposure in white light filter .",
    "after this the automated sequence rotated six times through the uvot filters , taking a series of short exposures ( @xmath31 , white , @xmath32 ; 10  s for white filters and 20  s for the rest ) .",
    "observations continued with the rotating filter wheel and a combination of exposures of 200  s , 300  s or 900  s up to @xmath33  ks .",
    "details of the uvot observation log are in @xcite .    to improve the signal to noise ratio of the afterglow detection , consecutive images were coadded to create at least 40  s exposures .",
    "photometric measurements were obtained from the uvot data with the tool uvotsource ( version 2.2 ) using a circular source extraction region with a @xmath34 and @xmath35 radius for the optical and uv filters , respectively .",
    "an aperture correction was then applied to the photometry to maintain compatibility with the current uvot effective area calibration .",
    "the background was measured in a source - free region near the target using an extraction radius of @xmath36 .    to combine uvot data with ground based observations , we re - calibrated the uvot b and v values with respect to the 5 field stars detected also in ground based b- and v - band observations .",
    "due to similarity of calibration stars colors the color correction between uvot and standard filter magnitudes could not be applied .",
    "observations with ground - based telescopes started shortly after the trigger time : raptor - s at @xmath37  s @xcite , super - lotis at @xmath38  s @xcite , nmsu-1 m telescope at @xmath39  s @xcite , pairitel at @xmath40  s @xcite , faulkes telescope north ( ftn ) at @xmath41  s @xcite , kait at @xmath42  s @xcite and 0.3-m telescope at new mexico skies observatory at @xmath43  s @xcite .",
    "the ftn reacted robotically and using the automatic grb - pipeline lt - trap @xcite , independently detected the fading optical afterglow at the position in agreement with the position from uvot : r.a.(j2000)=05:46:24.46 , dec(j2000)=@xmath4464:12:38.5 ( @xmath45 ) @xcite .",
    "detection of the ir afterglow at a consistent position followed shortly by @xcite .",
    "observations continued with several telescopes , including the sara telescope @xcite , the mt abu ir observatory ( miro ) @xcite , the tautenburg schmidt telescope ( tls ) @xcite , the sampurnanand telescope ( st ) @xcite , the maidanak observatory ( mao ) @xcite , the himalayan chandra telescope ( hct ) , and the observatorio de sierra nevada ( osn ) 1.5 m telescope .",
    "late time observations ( @xmath46  day ) were performed by the liverpool telescope ( lt ) as part of the _ robonet-1.0 _ project@xcite , as well as with the tls , isaac newton telescope ( int ) and gemini north .",

    "magnitudes in @xmath47 bands have been calibrated using landolt standard field stars @xcite observed by the ftn on the same night as the grb .",
    "the night was photometric and the zero point of each optical filter was stable throughout the entire ftn observational sequence .",
    "photometry was performed using the starlink gaia photometry tool , carefully selecting the right parameters for each observation acquired with different instruments .",
    "data taken by other telescopes were then cross - calibrated with the ftn observations using several stars in the field to provide a consistent and well - calibrated multi - telescope light curve .",
    "data from the lt , int and gemini north , as well as ftn @xmath48-band observations , were calibrated using the sdss pre - burst ( revised ) photometry @xcite .",
    "finally , the data were corrected for the galactic extinction : @xmath49  mag derived from the extinction maps by @xcite and @xmath50  mag ( following @xcite we evaluate @xmath51  mag , @xmath52  mag , @xmath53  mag and @xmath54  mag ) .",
    "conversion from magnitudes to flux densities followed @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the prompt emission of grb  061126 shows in all bat energy bands two main peaks and two smaller ones ( figure  [ fig : gammalc ] ) .",
    "the mask - weighted light curves show emission above background level starting at @xmath19  s. the brightest peak occurs at @xmath55  s and the last peak , which is also second brightest ends at @xmath56  s. low level emission is ongoing to @xmath57  s resulting in @xmath58  kev@xmath59  s. this @xmath1-ray emission tail is more evident in the logarithmic scale ( figure  [ fig : gammatail ] ) and can be fitted with a power - law of the form @xmath60 . using data points at @xmath61  s ( after the last peak ) , we derive best fit parameters @xmath62 , @xmath63  s with @xmath64 .",
    "we fit the bat total spectrum with the band function @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : gammaour ] shows our best fit , which gives following parameters : low - energy photon index @xmath65 = @xmath66 , high energy photon index @xmath67 ( fixed ) and @xmath68  kev at @xmath69 and @xmath70  kev at 90% cl .",
    "we note that our first value is not consistent with the value of @xmath71  kev derived by @xcite , and our latter value is in rough agreement with it .",
    "the discrepancy is presumably due to the neglect of soft gamma tail at @xmath72  s by @xcite .",
    "we compared our estimate of @xmath73 and photon index @xmath74 derived from bat data with the empirical relation between @xmath13 and @xmath75 found by @xcite , their figure  2 .",
    "we find our values in excellent agreement with this relation .",
    "to test the amati relation , we assume the redshift of @xmath6 determined by @xcite from the host galaxy spectroscopy .",
    "we use standard cosmology ( @xmath76  km  s@xmath77  mpc@xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) , and derive @xmath80  kev and @xmath81  erg .",
    "we find that this burst lies inside , although close to the @xmath82 border , of the updated amati relation ( see figure  2 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .        .",
    "]      kev energy band , showing a single power - law decay with small fluctuations evident throughout .",
    "the best fit power - law index is @xmath2 .",
    "blue : bat light curve is shown for comparisson . ]     and white filters .",
    "symbols show detections and arrows upper limits in given filter .",
    "data shown in this plot are not corrected for galactic extinction . ]",
    "the temporal behavior of the x - ray afterglow , shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] , is well described by a single power - law with index @xmath2 ; however , we note that the large value of the @xmath83 , reflects the presence of statistically significant fluctuations around the best - fitting power law . a similar flux variability was observed also in other x - ray afterglows , such as for grb  060124 @xcite . in order to investigate the possibility of a hidden x - ray break @xcite , fits with a broken or a smoothly broken power - law were performed , but they did not give a significant statistical improvement with respect to the simple power - law fit .",
    "since the fit with a broken power law gives a slightly lower value of @xmath84 , we performed f - test which showed that there is 33% probability that this improvement is due to a chance .",
    "therefore , we conclude that there is no evidence for a break in the x - ray light curve up to @xmath85  s.    the three xrt spectra ( from wt , first pc and later pc sequence ) were fitted separately using a power - law with a two component absorption , the first fixed at the galactic value of @xmath86  @xmath87 @xcite , the second taking into account the intrinsic absorption , left free to vary .",
    "no substantial spectral evolution was found .",
    "therefore , a simultaneous fit of the three spectra was performed in order to improve the significance of the fit parameters ( see figure  [ fig : sp ] ) .",
    "the best fit gives a power - law index @xmath88 , and an intrinsic absorbing column density @xmath89  @xmath87 .",
    "uvot data are shown in figure  [ uvot ] .",
    "the late start of the uvot observations ( at @xmath90  min ) and the faintness of the afterglow at this time resulted in large uncertainties on the measured magnitudes .",
    "we therefore did not attempt to fit the uvot light curves separately .",
    "from the detection of the optical counterpart in white , @xmath91 and @xmath92 filters , a photometric upper limit of the redshift of grb  061126 could be estimated to be @xmath93 @xcite , which is in agreement with @xmath94 estimated spectroscopically by @xcite .",
    "uvot data in @xmath95 and @xmath30 bands were re - calibrated and combined with the ground - based observations .    the ground - based optical observations are summarized in table  [ observations ] .",
    "light curves of the optical afterglow of grb  061126 in @xmath96 bands are plotted in figure  [ fig_lc ] .",
    "they show a power law decay with the steep - to - shallow transition between @xmath97  s and @xmath98  s , which is apparent in all filters .",
    "the light curves in all four filters were fitted with the same broken power - law , using all data points .",
    "the resulting @xmath99 was high due to fluctuations in the time interval between @xmath100  s to @xmath101  s. assuming a systematic error of 0.05  mag and 0.1  mag ( added in quadrature ) significantly improves the fit , giving broken power law parameters : @xmath102 , @xmath4 and @xmath103  s with @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig_lc ] shows the residuals with respect to the fit , where some additional variability is still evident .",
    "as discussed in the literature , the flattening of the optical light curve suggests a reverse shock origin for the early steep decay .",
    "theoretical models @xcite predict that while the reverse shock component decays with@xmath106 , the forward shock emission initially rises as @xmath107 , reaches the peak at @xmath108 when the typical frequency crosses the observation band , and decays afterwards with @xmath109 .",
    "the total flux is then a sum of both components . at earlier times",
    ", the reverse shock emission dominates the optical band , and masks the forward shock peak .",
    "the superposition of two simple power law components is used to fit the observational data .",
    "the best fitting temporal indices are : @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the quality of the fit , as indicated by @xmath112 , does not appear to be very robust , but we believe this reflects the presence of additional fluctuations superimposed on the underlying light curve , as discussed earlier ; overall , a reverse - shock , forward - shock scenario provides an adequate explanation for the underlying light curve shape . in ",
    "[ lateaft ] , we develop this further by considering the effect of the late - time behavior and properly accounting for the contribution of host galaxy .      from figure  [ fig_lc ] it is evident that there is no sign of the steepening of the optical light curve up to @xmath113  s. we can therefore set a firm lower limit to the time of the possible late - time break to be @xmath114  s.    later data points obtained by the int and gemini north at @xmath115  s in @xmath116 and @xmath48 bands ( which were excluded from our earlier fits ) lie 3.4 and 5.0  @xmath117 below the best fit curves .",
    "this discrepancy could be due to the fluctuating nature of the afterglow or indicate the presence of late time steepening . to further investigate the latter possibility , we considered the last optical data point ( gemini north ) , at @xmath118  s. this point seems to agree well with our fits , however , the gemini image shows that the ot was already faint compared to the host galaxy .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to reliably separate the contributions of the afterglow and the host galaxy to the measured magnitude .",
    "nevertheless , we can conclude that , taking into account the host galaxy contribution , the afterglow is fainter than what is expected in the absence of a late - time break .",
    "it is therefore likely that there was a steepening of the light curve before @xmath119  s.    to further constrain the time of the possible late time break , we considered two scenarios for the last gemini north point : ( i ) it represents the magnitude of the host galaxy only , or ( ii ) the magnitude of the host galaxy and afterglow are comparable at this time .",
    "we corrected the afterglow @xmath120-band light curve for the host contribution and repeated the above reverse - and - forward shock fit , while allowing the forward component to have a late time break . in both cases the best fit parameters",
    "@xmath121 and @xmath122 agree with previously derived values , while for the late time break we obtain : @xmath123  s in both cases , and the decay index after the break @xmath124 and @xmath125 for cases ( i ) and ( ii ) respectively .",
    "the result for the case ( i ) is shown in figure  [ fig : rsfs ] . case ( i ) is favoured by @xcite measurement of the host galaxy magnitude @xmath126 at @xmath127  days .",
    "this is brighter than our gemini north data point at @xmath128  days ( discrepancy is persumably due to larger aperture used by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implying that the latter is predominantly host .    from the updated ghirlanda correlation , i.e. eq .",
    "( 5 ) in @xcite , we derive @xmath129  erg ( taking into account the dispersion of the correlation ) , @xmath130 and @xmath131  days ( assuming @xmath132 , @xmath133 ) .",
    "this value is consistent with our conservative estimate above : 1.5  days @xmath134 15  days and with our value of @xmath135  days , obtained by the fits .",
    "nevertheless , the interpretation of this break as due to collimation is questionable , because there is no evidence of a simultaneous break in the x - rays ( for more examples and discussion on optical / x - ray breaks see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "a jet break visible only in the optical band is allowed if the x - ray emission originates from a different emission process or an emitting region that is physically distinct from that responsible for the optical radiation .      to further quantify the multiwavelength properties of this burst , spectral energy distributions ( seds ) at different epochs were constructed .",
    "optical data points at particular epochs were calculated using the interpolation with the best broken power law fit derived in ",
    "[ optaft ] .",
    "seds are presented in the grb rest frame assuming redshift @xmath6 . in all fitting procedures we applied the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) extinction profile @xcite and resulting",
    "@xmath136 is the host galaxy , rest frame extinction .",
    "although the optical to x - ray sed at early time is useful for diagnosing the magnetization of a fireball , there are no early xrt observations .",
    "we therefore estimate the x - ray emission at early time from a simple back - extrapolation of the monotonic decay @xmath138 observed at later time .",
    "this comparison is made at two different epochs before the flattening in the optical light curve , i.e. at @xmath33  s and at @xmath137  s. we made use of the _ swift _ xrt data and ground based optical data obtained by the ftn . at both epochs",
    "we obtain acceptable fits with a broken power law with : @xmath139 , @xmath140  hz and @xmath141 mag .    in the case of a strongly magnetized fireball , an excess of optical emission is predicted ; no conclusive evidence for such an excess is detected in grb061126 . nevertheless , the lack of an excess is not strongly constrained by this comparison , because even if an excess were present , the data could be equally well fitted with a different broken power law with a lower @xmath142 . the use of an sed to determine the magnetization of the fireball is therefore weak in this case and we introduce a more robust parameter to investigate magnetization in  [ optem ] .",

    "the time of the last sed , @xmath160  h , is the time at which @xcite compare the x - ray and optical fluxes of grbs and define the slope of the spectral energy distribution between the optical and the x - ray band @xmath161 as dividing optically bright from optically dark bursts . in the case of grb  061126 , at early time @xmath162 is less than this value ( as also noted by * ? ? ?",
    "our data yield @xmath163 at @xmath164  s , which is in slight excess of @xmath165 , derived by @xcite .",

    ".    nevertheless , observations at early time give a stringent test , i.e. a value of @xmath162 below the theoretical limit of @xmath167 implies that we can not explain it in the standard fireball model .",

    "as discussed in these previous cases , the flattening behavior of light curves can be interpreted with a reverse and forward shock scenario .",
    "the light curve of grb  061126 is composed of two segments : an initial steep decline followed by a shallower decay with the typical decay index of afterglow @xmath171 . while this typical , shallower decay is due to the forward shock ( with @xmath172 ) , the most likely explanation for the early optical emission is that it is dominated by short - lived emission from a reverse shock @xcite ( with @xmath173 ) .",
    "the color change reported by @xcite also implies the presence of different emission components .",
    "the emission components of forward and reverse shocks were studied in a unified manner by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the optical light curve of grb  061126 ( and those of grb  990123 and grb  021211 ) is well described by the flattening type light curve in @xcite .",
    "the evolution of reverse shocks is classified into two cases ( sari & piran 1995 ) depending on the initial lorentz factor of a fireball shell @xmath13 .",

    "alternatively , if @xmath182 , the reverse shock emission should initially drop sharply with @xmath183 , as a rarefaction wave quickly transfers the shell s internal energy to the ambient matter @xcite . therefore , in the case of grb  061126 , the initial lorentz factor should be close to the critical value , @xmath184    for @xmath185 , the reverse shock does not heat the shell well",
    ". the thin shell model should be applicable to characterize the reverse shock light curve . after the shock crossing @xmath186 , reverse shock light curves at frequencies @xmath187 behave as @xmath188 , where @xmath189 and @xmath190 are the typical and cooling frequencies of the reverse shock emission , @xmath191 is the electron spectral index , and a simple approximation form is employed for the decay index @xcite .",
    "light curves at frequencies @xmath192 are shallower as @xmath193 , and there is essentially no emission above @xmath190 @xcite .",
    "the observed decay index @xmath194 suggests @xmath187 during the steep decay phase and electron distribution index @xmath195 . as also observed in other bursts ,",
    "there is a bump feature in the optical light curve around the break @xmath196 @xcite .",
    "a density variation in the ambient medium is often discussed as the origin of bump features ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the bump is subtracted from the light curve , the values of @xmath11 and @xmath191 could be larger .    at the shock crossing time @xmath197",

    "we have assumed that @xmath191 and the electron equipartition parameter @xmath201 are the same for both the forward and reverse shock regions , but with different magnetic equipartition parameter @xmath9 as parameterized by the magnetic energy ratio @xmath202 .",
    "note that the definition of the magnetization correction factor is different from that in @xcite .",
    "the reason we introduce the @xmath203 parameter is that a fireball may be endowed with primordial magnetic fields at the central engine , so that in principle @xmath203 could be larger than unity .",
    "as we will discuss in  [ disx ] , the optical light curve ( before and after the break @xmath168 ) is consistent with the assumption that @xmath191 is the same in the two shock regions .    assuming no or moderate primordial magnetization in the fireball",
    ", we obtain a relation @xmath204 at the shock crossing time .",

    "it is possible to show that equation ( [ eq : rb ] ) is still valid .",
    "this event is a marginal case with @xmath185 , and the reverse shock emission should peak around the end of the prompt gamma - ray emission at @xmath218  s. unfortunately the forward shock peak @xmath108 was not caught ( it means that @xmath219  s ) , because the reverse shock emission dominated at early times .",
    "first we consider the case with the upper limit @xmath220 , and estimate @xmath203 .",
    "the peak time ratio is @xmath221 .",
    "since the optical light curve flattens at @xmath222 , the reverse shock and forward shock components are comparable at that time : @xmath223 , and it follows that the peak flux ratio can be written as @xmath224 . substituting this relation into equation ( [ eq : rb ] ) we obtain @xmath225 where ambient matter density @xmath226  proton/@xmath227 is assumed , but the result is insensitive to @xmath177 as @xmath228 for @xmath229 .",
    "if the forward shock emission reaches the maximum earlier @xmath230 , the value of @xmath203 might be different . to evaluate how @xmath203 depends on @xmath108",
    ", we refer to scalings : @xmath231 and @xmath232 , where we took into account that the peak of the forward shock emission should be on the power law line with @xmath122 .",
    "using these scalings , one finds that the dependence is weak : @xmath233 for @xmath234 . in the earliest case @xmath235 s ,",
    "we obtain @xmath236 .",
    "these results imply that magnetic energy density in a fireball is much larger than in the forward shock .",
    "nevertheless , as a small value of @xmath237 is usually inferred from afterglow modeling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the above values of @xmath203 suggest that @xmath238 and the energy in the fireball is still likely to take the form of kinetic energy ( a baryonic fireball ) rather than poynting flux .",
    "recently the liverpool telescope obtained an early - time estimate of optical polarization of a grb afterglow shortly after the burst @xcite .",
    "polarization observations of an afterglow with a flattening light curve or at the time of a reverse shock peak would provide additional constraints on the presence of magnetized fireballs .",
    "the x - ray afterglow was observed from @xmath239  min to @xmath240  days by _ swift _ xrt .",
    "the x - ray light curve fades as a single power law with a decay index @xmath241 .",
    "since this is steeper than the optical light curve @xmath242 over the same period , the x - ray band should be in a different spectral domain than the optical , therefore : @xmath243 .",
    "the observed x - ray spectral index @xmath244 corresponds to @xmath245 . the optical emission from the reverse shock and forward shock should decay as @xmath246 and @xmath247 , respectively .",
    "these are in good agreement with the observed @xmath194 and @xmath248 .",
    "as we have discussed in the previous section , the bump feature in the early optical light curve might make the observed @xmath121 smaller and the observed @xmath122 larger .",
    "the observed emission in x - rays ( @xmath249 ) decays faster than that expected from the x - ray spectral index @xmath250 .",
    "this discrepancy might be due to the radiative loss .",
    "if the energy distribution of electrons is flat @xmath251 , each decade in the electron distribution contains the same amount of energy , and if @xmath252 , high energy electrons have most of the total electron energy . even in the slow cooling regime @xmath253 , the radiative loss might make the decay steeper @xmath254 @xcite .",
    "however , the radiation loss affects the optical emission also , and the expected ( steeper ) optical index is not consistent with the observations .",
    "more general discussion on the time dependent parameters can be given as follows .",
    "the ratio of x - ray to optical flux depends on parameters as @xmath255 where we have assumed the standard synchrotron spectrum ( @xmath256 ) and an adiabatic evolution of the blast wave .",
    "if the parameters are slowly changing in time ( e.g. radiation loss , late - time energy injection , time dependent microscopic parameters or a gradient in the ambient density ) , the difference of the decay indexes in the two bands could be larger than the standard value @xmath257 .",
    "the observed difference @xmath258 requires that the parameters should increase with time .",
    "this is a somewhat unphysical condition , and causes a large discrepancy between the theoretical and observed optical decay indices , because the optical flux is sensitive to the parameters as @xmath259 .",
    "inverse compton scattering can , in principle , affect the cooling frequency @xmath260 , and a correction factor to @xmath260 is time - dependent during the slow cooling phase .",
    "however , the presence of strong inverse compton cooling will make the difference @xmath261 even smaller @xcite .",
    "an alternative possibility for the production of the x - ray afterglow is a continued activity of the central engine ( e.g. late prompt emission , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or a two - component jet ( @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the optical light curve shows evidence of a late time break which is consistent with the value derived from the ghirlanda relation .",
    "the lack of a simultaneous ( jet ) break in the x - ray light curve might indicate that the x - rays originate from a different emission site .",
    "another indication is the low value of @xmath162 at early times ( see  [ dark ] ) , which might suggest the enhancement of the x - ray flux due to the additional emission @xcite .",
    "if the additional emission ( e.g. late - time prompt emission or narrow jet emission in the two - component jet model ) masks the forward shock emission in x - ray band , the decay rate is determined by the process related to the additional component . in principle",
    "the decay rate could be faster than that implied by the fireball model until the forward shock emission is eventually unmasked . to interpret the chromatic afterglow of grb  080319b ,",
    "@xcite suggest a two - component jet model in which the additional component ( emission from a spreading narrow jet ) decays faster than the underlying component ( wide jet emission ) responsible for the optical component . in the case of grb  061126 , the faster decay in x - ray",
    "could be explained if the electron distribution index @xmath191 is not universal and larger in the narrow jet , though we need to explain what causes the difference of @xmath191 in the two jets .",
    "furthermore , the x - ray ( narrow - jet emission ) light curve does not show a jet break before @xmath262  s , while the optical ( wide - jet emission ) light curve shows a possible steepening at @xmath263  s. the two - component jet model might be disfavored to explain grb  061126 .",
    "as @xcite have discussed , any additional component models might share a difficulty to explain how to avoid contaminating the blue end of the observed optical spectrum with emission from the low - energy tail of the additional emission ( a synchrotron - like spectrum ) peaking at x - ray wavelengths .",
    "this could require fine - tuning or tight constraints on the additional emission model ( e.g. the self absorption frequency of the additional emission is higher than the optical band ) .    as we noted in ",
    "[ sed ] , our fits suggest that @xmath142 is increasing with time .",
    "this could imply the presence of a wind environment .",
    "we have assumed a homogeneous ambient medium ( ism ) in the above discussion . even in a wind medium , the relations ( [ eq : relations ] ) are valid .",
    "the same relation @xmath264 should be satisfied to explain the steep optical decay in the context of the reverse shock emission . at late times",
    "@xmath265 , if the optical and x - ray afterglows are due to the forward shock , the x - ray decay rate should be the same as or slower than the optical decay rate , because the cooling frequency @xmath260 moves blue - ward in the wind model .",
    "this is inconsistent with the observations .",
    "therefore , the ism model is favored .",
    "one possible explanation for the increase of the break frequency would be related to the reverse shock emission component at early time . when the relation @xmath266 is satisfied , the forward shock emission spectrum ( optical to x - ray ) is fitted with a broken power law .",
    "even if reverse shock emission dominates the optical band , the spectrum could be still well fitted with a broken power law with a lower break frequency , because we observe only optical and x - ray fluxes and our samplings are spares in the frequency domain .",
    "the reverse shock component decays faster than the forward shock component , and it becomes less prominent at late times .",
    "the break frequency should increase and approaches the break frequency of the forward shock at late times .",
    "this might explain the observed behavior .",
    "however , at the time the x - ray observations started and onwards , the contribution of the reverse shock to the optical emission is already negligible and could not significantly influence the break frequency .",
    "another possibility is that of late - time prompt emission i.e. x - rays coming from an emission site other than that of the forward shock .",
    "the gamma - ray tail is described by a power law with @xmath267 .",
    "the similarity of @xmath268 with @xmath269 index leads to a speculation that the @xmath1 tail is due to the same forward shock and that the gamma - ray band at the early times @xmath270  s and the x - ray band at late times @xmath271  min are in the same spectral domain : @xmath272 .",
    "however , using @xmath273 , the extrapolated value in gamma - ray band at @xmath274  min gives a spectral index @xmath275 , which is much shallower than the observed x - ray spectrum @xmath276 .",
    "we therefore suspect that the same decay index @xmath277 happened by chance .",
    "the bright gamma - ray tail might be produced by the superposition of internal shock emission ( central engine activity ) or the propagation of the forward shock in a higher density ambient medium ( if so , the cooling frequency should be above the gamma - ray band at @xmath278  s ) .",
    "grb  061126 was a long burst with intriguing optical and x - ray afterglows .",
    "the optical light curve shows a steep - to - flat transition at about 13  min after the trigger .",
    "we showed that the early , steep component can be interpreted as due to the reverse shock ( @xmath194 ) , while the later slowly fading component as coming from the forward shock ( @xmath279 ) . from the afterglow properties we deduce that @xmath280 and",
    "estimate the magnetic energy ratio to be @xmath281 .",
    "this indicates that the magnetic energy density in the fireball is much larger than in the forward shock at the fireball deceleration , but that the fireball is still likely to be baryonic and not poynting flux dominated .",
    "the standard fireball model can explain the optical decay indices before and after the flattening , i.e. @xmath169 and @xmath170 , and the x - ray spectral index @xmath282 with a single value of electron index @xmath283 .",
    "however , the x - ray decay index @xmath2 deviates from the expected value @xmath284 .",
    "we investigated the generalized standard fireball model with time dependent parameters ( e.g. radiation loss , late time energy injection , time dependent microscopic parameters or a gradient in the ambient density ) , and we found that none of these modified models can explain the observed decay and spectral indices in a consistent manner .",
    "this could imply the presence of late - time prompt emission and a different origin of the x - ray afterglow , which would also be a possible explanation for the large ratio of x - ray to optical fluxes ( i.e. shallow spectral index from optical to x - ray band ) and for the possible chromatic jet break at @xmath285  days .",
    "although there are significant fluctuations in the observed x - ray light curve , the late time internal - shock model could require a fine tuning of the central engine to explain the power - law decay .",
