    "in collisionally ionized or x - ray photoionized plasmas , high - energy electrons or photons lead to the production of @xmath0-vacancy ionic states which then decay via sequential emission of single or multiple electrons and/or photons .",
    "the exact strengths of these competing processes determine fundamentally important quantities of the plasma such as the ionization balance and the observed spectra of emitted and/or absorbed photons .",
    "hence , interpreting the properties of these plasmas requires accurate atomic physics calculations for the various autoionization and radiative rates .",
    "here we are interested in assessing the accuracy of the available data base that provides such computed ( or inferred ) auger rates and fluorescence yields to the astrophysics community .",
    "the accuracy of these atomic data are crucial to the interpretation of the spectra of photoionized plasmas such as are found in x - ray binaries and active galactic nuclei .",
    "these data are also important for supernova remnants ( snrs ) under conditions of non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) .    two of the more widely used spectral codes for modeling photoionized plasmas are cloudy @xcite and xstar @xcite .",
    "a commonly used code for modeling nei in snrs is that of @xcite .",
    "these all in turn rely on the table of electron and photon emission probabilities compiled by .",
    "this comprehensive data base considers the sequential multiple electron and/or photon ejections for all stages of all @xmath0-vacancy ions in the periodic table up through zinc . in order to produce such a massive array of numbers ,",
    "however , certain approximations , questionable from a purely theoretical atomic physics standpoint , were invoked .",
    "first , the only rigorously computed atomic rates were taken from the early works of @xcite for _ singly - charged ions _ , which furthermore neglected configuration interaction ( ci ) and spin - orbit effects .",
    "due to the limited computational resources available at the time , and the approximations thus needed to perform such calculations , even these can not be considered as reliable as those that can be carried out with today s state - of - the - art capabilities .",
    "second , these singly - ionized results were then scaled along entire isoelectronic sequences , assuming constant autoionization rates and oscillator strengths ; this approximation is least valid for near - neutrals .",
    "a third approximation used by is that the electron and photon emission yields were computed using radiative and autoionization rates that were configuration averaged over possible terms , and the fluorescence yield was then given as a ratio of the averaged radiative rate to the sum of the averaged radiative and averaged auger rate .",
    "for modeling purposes , however , this is incorrect ; the actual required value is the average of the term - specific yields - an average of ratios rather than a ratio of averages . in other words ,",
    "the relative probability of producing each specific inner - shell - vacancy term , and its subsequent term - specific decay , needs to be considered , and this was not done correctly for the data compiled by ( see also @xcite for a further discussion of this importance ) .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the validity of the above three approximations in order to assess the accuracy of the resultant data base of . to this end",
    ", we first study the simplest @xmath0-vacancy system that can radiate via a @xmath2 dipole - allowed transition .",
    "this is the removal of a @xmath0 electron from the ground - state b - like sequence , or rather the @xmath3 be - like inner - shell excited sequence , which is investigated in the next section , and which is further simplified by the fact that only one electron , or one photon , can be emitted .",
    "we follow in section  [ sec : f ] with a study of the simplest closed-(outer)shell case of f - like ions , corresponding to @xmath0 vacancies from the ne - like sequence .",
    "a summary of our findings and concluding remarks are then given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "inner - shell @xmath0 vacancy of a be - like ion , whether by photoionization or electron - impact ionization of b - like ions ( or by photoexcitation or electron - impact excitation of be - like ions ) , results in either the @xmath4 state or the @xmath5 state . from an independent particle perspective ,",
    "in ls coupling , the following competing decay processes can then occur : @xmath6 that is , the @xmath0-vacancy state can either fluoresce , if it is in the @xmath7 state , with a radiative rate @xmath8 , or autoionize , from either state , with a total state - dependent rate @xmath9 , yielding free electrons denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "( if left in the @xmath11 state the ion does not fluoresce - we consider ci and spin - orbit effects in the next section ) .",
    "the radiative rate @xmath8 in atomic units ( 1 a.u .",
    "@xmath12 ) is related to the dimensionless emission oscillator strength @xmath13 by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the emitted photon energy in a.u .",
    "( 1 a.u . of energy",
    "@xmath16 ev ) and @xmath17 is the fine structure constant .",
    "here we define the emission oscillator strength as the absolute value of the oscillator strength from the upper @xmath18 term @xmath19 to the lower @xmath20 term @xmath21 : @xmath22 and can thus be related to the absorption oscillator strength @xmath23 from the lower term @xmath21 to the upper term @xmath19 via @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the statistical weights of the initial and final be - like terms , respectively .",
    "oscillator strengths are more convenient quantities to use along isoelectronic sequences because they exhibit certain bounds .",
    "since the absorption oscillator strength is bounded by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the number of @xmath0 electrons , the emission oscillator strength is bounded by @xmath29 ( for the present cases ) , and is a well - behaved function of the nuclear charge @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , if the hydrogenic approximation is valid , i.e. , if the nuclear potential dominates over the interelectronic repulsive potential , then the emission oscillator strength is _ independent _ of @xmath1 , and the same is true for the autoionization rate @xmath30 .",
    "such an approximation is valid for highly - charged ions but not for lower - charged species .",
    "the fluorescence yield @xmath31 , from a given inner - shell vacancy state , is a measure of the relative probabilities of the radiative and autoionization decay pathways and is defined as @xmath32}\\ \\ . \\label{eqfy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus it only depends on the squared transition energy @xmath33 and the ratio of the autoionization rate to the emission oscillator strength @xmath34 . in the hydrogenic approximation ,",
    "these scale respectively with nuclear charge as @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( i.e. , independent of @xmath37 ) , where @xmath38 is the asymptotic ionic charge seen by the outer - most electron of the be - like ion @xcite . with these scaling properties ,",
    "the expected behaviors at low-@xmath1 and high-@xmath1 are @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( provided @xmath41 ) , respectively .      as pointed in section  [ sec : be ] , both the @xmath7 and @xmath11 terms can be populated after @xmath0 photoionization or electron - impact ionization .",
    "following @xcite , and using the sudden approximation , we have determined that the probability of populating each term can be deduced by considering the squared recoupling coefficient @xmath422p\\left(^2p\\right)\\left\\vert \\left[\\left(1s2p\\right)\\left(^{\\left\\{2{\\cal s}+1\\right\\}}p\\right)\\right ] 1s\\left(^2p\\right)\\right\\rangle\\right\\vert\\right.^2 & = & \\left\\vert\\left(-1\\right)^{1+{\\cal s}}\\left(2{\\cal s}+1\\right)^\\frac{1}{2 } \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{ccc } { \\cal s } & \\frac{1}{2 } & \\frac{1}{2 } \\\\                                   0 & \\frac{1}{2 } & \\frac{1}{2 }   \\end{array}\\right\\}\\right\\vert^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{2{\\cal s}+1}{4}\\ , \\label{eqrecoup}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 for the @xmath7 state and @xmath44 for the @xmath11 state .",
    "this means that the states are populated according to their statistical weights , and the @xmath7 state is populated with a probability of @xmath45 .",
    "( in general , there also should be a recoupling coefficient involving the orbital angular momenta of the three electrons in eq .",
    "[ eqrecoup ] ; however , the @xmath46 values for two of the electrons orbital momenta reduces the coefficient to unity for the present case . )",
    "we have also verified this computationally by performing r - matrix photoionization calculations using the wigner - eisenbud r - matrix method @xcite . using both approaches",
    "we find that in intermediate coupling , the states are also populated according to their statistical weights ( a similar expression to eq .",
    "[ eqrecoup ] involving the total angular momentum values @xmath19 for each electron can be obtained ) .",
    "considering the relative populations of the @xmath3 @xmath0-vacancy states , the desired quantity for plasma modeling purposes is the configuration - average fluorescence yield .",
    "if ci and spin - orbit effects are neglected , this can be defined as an average over ls single - configuration ( sc ) terms as @xmath47 where fluorescence from the @xmath11 state is zero so that the asymptotic behavior at large @xmath1 is @xmath45 .",
    "ci and spin - orbit effects modify this behavior , however .",
    "the largest ci effect is the intrashell mixing @xmath48 , where the mixing fraction @xmath49 is essentially term independent and @xmath1 independent for nonrelativistic calculations - it varies between 0.067 for and 0.053 for .",
    "this mixing affects the computed emission oscillator strength @xmath13 and autoionization rate @xmath30 at the near neutral end of the sequence , but changes the high-@xmath1 fluorescence yield by less than 10% .",
    "the more important ci effect is that the admixture of the @xmath50 configuration in the @xmath11 term allows it to radiate to the @xmath51 state .",
    "this @xmath52 radiative rate is about a factor of 20 smaller than the @xmath53 rate , so it only increases the fluorescence yield by a few percent at low @xmath1 .",
    "as @xmath1 increases , however , eventually even this reduced radiative rate dominates the autoionization rate , giving @xmath54    the spin - orbit interaction also affects the computed fluorescence yield , primarily by mixing the @xmath55 and @xmath56 levels . the mixing fraction , while only about @xmath57 at @xmath58 , has a @xmath59 dependence , and eventually becomes quite significant , reaching @xmath60 at @xmath61 . as a result ,",
    "the `` @xmath56 '' level ( this is now just a label used to indicate the dominant term of a level ) has an increased fluorescence yield , and we get that the intermediate coupling ( ic ) , configuration - averaged fluorescence yield , including ci , behaves as @xmath62 thus we see that ci and the spin - orbit interaction each cause an increase in the computed fluorescence yield as @xmath1 is increased .",
    "the approach of for this particular be - like series was to neglect spin - orbit and ci effects , and to assume that the hydrogenic approximation is valid throughout the series .",
    "furthermore , they used configuration - averaged values for the autoionization rate and emission oscillator strength , which were computed by @xcite , and the experimental values of @xmath15 from @xcite , to obtain the ratio @xmath63 required for determining @xmath31 using eq .",
    "this is not the same as the desired configuration - averaged fluorescence yield @xmath64 in eq .",

    "fluorescence yields are presented in the last subsection , where the incorrect averaging and neglect of ci and spin - orbit effects by are addressed .      in order to calculate the transition matrix elements appearing in the expressions for the radiative and autoionization rates",
    "@xcite , it is first necessary to produce atomic wave functions .",
    "@xcite used the herman - skillman approximation in determining the ( single - configuration ) wave functions , whereby _ all _ electrons ( i.e. , the @xmath0 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and continuum ones ) are eigenfunctions of a common central potential ; as stated by @xcite , this `` neglect(s ) ... exchange and correlation effects . '' furthermore , this potential @xmath68 is approximated by `` a series of straight lines '' in order to yield piece - by - piece analytic whitakker functions .",

    "note that the partial rate @xmath82 in eq .",
    "[ eqaa1new ] is greatly suppressed relative to the @xmath83 rate due to a near cancellation of monopole and dipole slater integrals .",
    "( indeed , it was due to this near cancellation of slater integrals that @xcite explained why the inner - shell photoexcited @xmath18 resonance in preferentially decayed - by two orders of magnitude - to the @xmath84 channel , compared to the @xmath85 channel . )",
    "thus the configuration average partial rate @xmath86 will be larger than the partial rate @xmath82 , and hence the configuration average total rate @xmath87 will be larger than @xmath88 .",
    "since we are interested in computing @xmath89 , which requires @xmath90 and @xmath91 , we have converted the reported values from @xcite to the @xmath7 values ( the slater integrals were also given in that work ) .",
    "we get the following values @xmath92 which compare fairly well with our results obtained using autostructure : @xmath93    in summary , we find that the earlier results for of @xcite are consistent with ours . however , for the astrophysical plasma modeling purposes we have in mind , one really requires the configuration average fluorescence yield , not the ratio of the averaged radiative and total rates used by @xmath94 due to @xmath8 and @xmath30 scaling as @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively , in the hydrogenic approximation .",
    "equation  [ eqxikm ] differs from the correct @xmath64 given in eq .",
    "first , we have @xmath95 due to the near cancellation in the @xmath7 @xmath96 partial autoionization rate , so at low @xmath1 , where @xmath97 , we have @xmath98 .",
    "second , when ci and spin - orbit effects are ignored , as they were in , the fluorescence yields differ asymptotically by a factor of 4 , @xmath99 as can be seen by comparing eqs .",
    "[ eqca ] and [ eqxikm ] .",
    "of course , ci needs to be included for all @xmath1 , whereas spin - orbit mixing needs to be included at higher @xmath1 , and both @xmath100 and @xmath101 as @xmath102 .",
    "however , in the intermediate @xmath1 range , it can be shown that the results are still larger than the icci results .      in order to assess the validity of scaling the results along the isoelectronic series , we computed both the @xmath7 autoionization rate @xmath30 and emission oscillator strength @xmath13 for all be - like ions up through zinc , first neglecting spin - orbit effects . in fig .",
    "1 , it is seen that neither of the two is independent of the nuclear charge @xmath1 at the lowest stages of ionization - the emission oscillator strength increases by about @xmath103 in going toward the highly - ionized regime whereas the autoionization rate more than doubles .",
    "furthermore , by choosing the scale so that our two quantities coincide for , it is seen that the important ratio @xmath34 appearing in eq .",
    "[ eqfy ] increases by roughly 25% by the time is reached .",
    "thus the assumption of pure hydrogenic scaling by alone introduces an uncertainty at the highly - charged end of this series . due to the stronger @xmath1 dependence at the near - neutral end , together with the greater sensitivity to the atomic basis used in this region",
    ", we recommend that if scaling along an isoelectronic sequence is to be performed , the better starting point would be at the highest @xmath1 desired , extrapolating the rates to lower @xmath1 members .",
    "of course , given the ease of determining atomic rates with modern computing capabilities , the most reliable approach is to calculate the fluorescence yield directly rather than resort to questionable scaling methods .",
    "while the assumption of hydrogenic scaling introduces an @xmath104 inaccuracy in @xmath34 , the initial quantity being scaled in - the ratio of averages rather than the average of ratios - is really not the desired quantity to be scaled in the first place .",
    "together , these approximations lead to an uncertain prediction for the fluorescence yield . in fig .  2 ( and table  1 )",
    ", we compare various results for @xmath31 along the be - like sequence , where it can be seen that our single - configuration ls results differ greatly from those of , especially at higher @xmath1 ; here , especially , their results are expected to differ from the correct single - configuration values due to their incorrect asymptotic value given by eq .",
    "[ eqxikm ] .",
    "a more disturbing result was found when we tried to repeat their calculations , i.e. , when we used eq .",
    "[ eqfy ] , with the ratio of @xmath105 taken from @xcite , and the energies @xmath15 taken from @xcite .",
    "whereas these scaled results exhibit a smooth monotonic increase with nuclear charge @xmath1 , those of are somewhat irregular , showing unphysical dips , and do not agree with what we tried to reproduce , given their stated method .",
    "either way , the results of , or our scaled ones using the results of @xcite , initially underestimate our results at lower @xmath1 , and then overestimate our ( lssc ) results by almost a factor of 3 for the highest @xmath61 .    to our knowledge ,",
    "there have been two other calculations for the fluorescence yields of some members of the be - like sequence : those of @xcite using the hullac codes @xcite and those of @xcite using a multiconfiguration dirac - fock ( mcdf ) method . in both cases , ci and spin - orbit effects were included .",
    "here we do the same , first adding the important @xmath106 ci discussed earlier to the ls calculations in order to see that this effect increases the @xmath61 fluorescence yield by about 30% .",
    "then when spin - orbit effects ( and other higher - order , relativistic effects ) are included in our intermediate coupling calculation , there is a further increase in the fluorescence yield by about 20% more . in comparison with the other two calculations along this series",
    ", there is overall good agreement with these ic results .",
    "we turn now to the simplest closed-(outer)shell case of a @xmath0-vacancy in f - like ions , giving the @xmath107 state which decays as @xmath108 again , only one photon , or one electron , can be emitted , which simplifies the analysis considerably ( when spin - orbit effects are considered , the final ionic term in eq .  [ eqarf ] is fine structure split into the ground @xmath109 level and the metastable @xmath110 level ) .",
    "since this is a closed - shell system , the herman - skillman method for the important @xmath67 electrons is expected to be more accurate than for . indeed , as stated by @xcite , `` in stripping away electrons ( in reducing to a closed - shell system ) ,",
    "... we should be increasing the applicability of the common central - field approximation . ''",
    "furthermore , there is only one @xmath111 @xmath0-vacancy state , rather than the two we had for the be - like sequence , and no other intrashell configurations to ci mix with , so we do not need to consider population of non - fluorescing states by ci or spin - orbit mixing , nor do we have to consider configuration averaging issues .",
    "consequently , a single configuration ls coupling calculation is sufficient to determine accurate @xmath30 , @xmath13 , and @xmath31 values for the @xmath112 term .    as a result",
    ", the computed values of the autoionization rate and emission oscillator strength given by @xcite agree quite well with our values , as seen in fig .  3 and table  2 . however , both of these values depend on the internuclear charge @xmath1 , giving a ratio @xmath34 that increases by about a factor of @xmath113 in going from to .",
    "thus the scaled fluorescence yield @xmath31 , using eq .",
    "[ eqfy ] , the ratio @xmath34 from @xcite , and @xmath15 from @xcite , increases relative to the actual computed value , as is seen in fig .  4 and table  2 .",
    "the more troublesome news in this figure is the actual tabulated values of - their values do not follow our attempt at reproducing those results , but rather tend to follow our computed values , except for certain unphysical dips .",
    "nevertheless , the results reported by for f - like ions are not plagued by as many uncertainties as those for be - like ions .",
    "we also see in fig .  4 that the hullac results are in good agreement with our present ones ( the results reported earlier by @xcite only considered fluorescence into the @xmath109 level , which includes only 4 of all 6 magnetic sublevels of the @xmath114 configuration ; therefore , those values must be multiplied by about 3/2 to account for fluorescence into the two @xmath110 sublevels as well .",
    "furthermore , the earlier hullac result for f@xmath115 was erroneously listed incorrectly , and here we have given the actual computed value that should have appeared ) .",
    "the inaccuracies we have discovered in the reported results of for be - like ions are as follows :    1 .   the computed atomic data for are used in the form @xmath105 , that is",
    ", the radiative and autoionization rates have been averaged over the @xmath7 and @xmath11 configurations , whereas the desired quantity for plasma modeling applications is @xmath116 and is not the same thing , differing qualitatively and quantitatively , especially in the asymptotic high-@xmath1 limit .",
    "the hydrogenic scaling assumed is invalid .",
    "the autoionization rates , the emission oscillator strengths , and even the ratio @xmath34 are not independent of nuclear charge @xmath1 .",
    "3 .   the tabulated data of do not seem to follow the results we obtain when we try to reproduce their stated method using eq .",
    "[ eqfy ] , with @xmath105 from @xcite , and @xmath15 from @xcite .",
    "4 .   the calculations of neglected ci and spin - orbit effects as they scaled to higher @xmath1 .    for f - like ions , items 1 and 4 are not issues since there is only one inner - shell vacancy term .",
    "however , points 2 and 3 still apply for the f - like sequence . for plasma modeling purposes ,",
    "we recommend our @xmath116 for the be - like sequence and our @xmath31 for the f - like sequence .    in conclusion , we propose that , given the many uncertainties discovered , the entire data base of should be reevaluated . while we have focused on systems that can emit only one photon or one electron ,",
    "their comprehensive tabulation also includes data for ions with @xmath117 shells occupied ; these can emit multiple electrons and/or photons through numerous cascading channels , compounding the inaccuracies we have discovered .",
