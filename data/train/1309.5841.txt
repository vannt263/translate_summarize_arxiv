    "as it is well known under reasonable conditions the mixed partial derivatives of a real function coincide . this result has a long history and several distinguished scholars provided proofs including euler and clairaut .",
    "however , according to lindelf none of those proofs was free of errors or tacit assumptions , so that historians give credit for the first correct proof to h. a. schwarz , see @xcite for a nice historical account .",
    "actually , the first correct proof of the equality of mixed partial derivatives was obtained by cauchy who improved and amended a previous proof by lagrange .",
    "however , they assumed the existence and continuity of the derivatives @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "schwarz removed this assumption and showed also that the continuity of @xmath2 could be obtained from the other hypothesis .",
    "let @xmath3 .",
    "he proved @xcite :    * let @xmath4 and suppose that @xmath5 exists and belongs to @xmath6",
    ". then @xmath7 exists and @xmath8 .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the assumptions can be weakened .",
    "stronger versions can be found in the first published studies of this problem .",
    "for instance , dini in his `` lezioni di analisi infinitesimale '' @xcite does not assume @xmath9 , but demands just the existence of the partial derivatives and the continuity of @xmath10 in @xmath11 .",
    "means @xmath12 .",
    "we stress that in the terminology of this article a necessary condition for a limit , such as a partial derivative , to exist will be its finiteness .",
    "that is , we do not tacitly use the extended real line , as some other authors do .",
    "this convention allows us to write just `` exists '' in place of `` exists and is finite '' . ]",
    "the strongest result in this direction seems to have been obtained by peano who removed the assumption on the continuity of @xmath10 from dini s version @xcite .",
    "peano s version can be found in rudin @xcite .",
    "* let @xmath13 .",
    "suppose that @xmath14 , @xmath10 and @xmath12 exist on @xmath15 and that the latter is continuous at @xmath16",
    ". then @xmath17 .",
    "the continuity of @xmath18 is not assumed and there are indeed discontinuous functions which admit everywhere partial derivatives at any order @xcite .",
    "many authors tried to weaken the conditions of schwarz s theorem in other directions .",
    "young proved the following result ( see apostol ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theor.12.12 ) ) :    * let @xmath13 . if both partial derivatives @xmath14 and @xmath10 exist in neighborhood of @xmath19 and if both are differentiable at @xmath16 , then @xmath20 .    we observe that these assumptions imply that @xmath14 and @xmath10 being continuous at @xmath16 are bounded in a neighborhood of this point , thus @xmath18 is lipschitz and hence continuous in such neighborhood . as with lagrange - cauchy version , young s result assumes the existence of both @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we are now going to prove a results which improves peano s .",
    "it is based on the concept of strong differentiation also introduced by himself in @xcite .",
    "it seems that he did not realize the usefulness of strong differentiation for the problem of the equality of mixed derivatives , possibly because he investigated the latter problem before the introduction of this derivative .    recently",
    "the notion of strong differentiation has received renewed attention since it has been proved that the exponential map of lipschitz connections or sprays over @xmath23 manifolds is strongly differentiable at the origin @xcite .",
    "this fact implies that the exponential map is a lipeomorphism near the origin .",
    "thus this notion proves important to do differential geometry under weak differentiability conditions .",
    "a function @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , is said to be _ partially strongly differentiable _ with respect to @xmath27 at @xmath28 , with differential @xmath29 if for every @xmath30 , there is a @xmath31 such that for every @xmath32 such that @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 if @xmath18 does not depend on @xmath39 then @xmath14 is called _ differential _ and is denoted @xmath40 .    clearly , if a function is strongly differentiable then it is differentiable , and the strong differential coincides with the differential .",
    "some interesting properties are @xcite :    * if @xmath18 is strongly differentiable at @xmath41 then its satisfies a lipschitz condition in a neighborhood of @xmath41 . *",
    "if @xmath18 is differentiable in a neighborhood of @xmath41 and the differential is continuous at @xmath41 then it is strongly differentiable at @xmath41 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath18 is strongly differentiable at @xmath41 and the differential exists in a neighborhood of @xmath41 then the differential is continuous at @xmath42 a similar version for partial strong differentiation holds ( this point is an easy consequence of the mean value theorem ) . *",
    "if @xmath18 is strongly differentiable over a subset @xmath43 then the strong differential is continuous over @xmath44 with respect to the induced topology .",
    "in particular , a function is strongly differentiable in an open set @xmath15 if and only if it is continuously differentiable on @xmath15 .",
    "the concept of strong differentiation has some advantages over that of ordinary ( frechet ) differentiation .",
    "in particular , it allows us to obtain simpler and stronger results through shorter proofs .",
    "it serves better the intuition and at the elementary level could possibly replace the usual differentiation in elementary textbooks on analysis .",
    "indeed , it extends the the range of applicability of some key results in analysis by removing some continuity assumptions on derivatives .",
    "for instance :    * a function which is partially strongly differentiable with respect to all its variables at a point @xmath41 is also totally strongly differentiable at that point @xmath41 @xcite . *",
    "if a function @xmath45 has positive strong derivative at a point then it is increasing in a neighborhood of that point . more generally ,",
    "if a function @xmath46 has invertible strong differential at a point @xmath41 then it is injective in a neighborhood of @xmath41 and the inverse is strongly differentiable at @xmath47 with @xmath48 ( leach s inverse function theorem @xcite )    let us observe that the usual assumptions that make the corresponding results hold for ordinary differentiation imply that the differential is continuous in a neighborhood of @xmath41 . as observed above these assumptions",
    "serve essentially to assume strong differentiability in a neighborhood without naming it .",
    "the point of using strong differentiability is that strong differentiability at a point suffices .",
    "peano s theorem on the equality of mixed partial derivatives at @xmath16 demands the existence of @xmath12 in a neighborhood of @xmath16 and its continuity there . by ( ii ) above , @xmath14 is partially strongly differentiable with respect to @xmath11 at @xmath16 , thus one can ask whether the previous conditions can be replaced by partial strong differentiability .",
    "the answer is affirmative .",
    "the author reobtained the next theorem unaware of a previous result by mikusiski @xcite subsequently generalized to banach spaces by skrnik @xcite .",
    "mikusiski calls  full derivative \" the peano s strong derivative and does not give references so that it was quite hard to spot his important work @xcite .",
    "he reobtains first results due to peano and more advanced results such as leach s inverse function theorem , but he also obtain new results on the role of strong differentiation in integration theory . in ( * ? ? ?",
    "12 ) he provides the best and most complete introduction to strong derivatives up to date .",
    "the fact that he published those results in polish @xcite and in some sections in a book devoted to quite different problems did not help to spread knowledge of his important contributions .",
    "for completeness we include the next proof as it is different from mikuskinski s and has weaker assumptions .",
    "let @xmath13 .",
    "suppose that the partial derivative @xmath14 exists on @xmath15 and that it is partially strongly differentiable with respect to @xmath11 at @xmath16 .",
    "then , denoting with @xmath49 the subset where @xmath10 exists , provided @xmath50 , @xmath51 is partially strongly differentiable with respect to @xmath27 at @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we stress that while the assumptions are weaker than peano s , the conclusion is stronger . for instance",
    ", the previous theorem implies that if @xmath52 exists in a neighborhood of @xmath53 then it is continuous at @xmath53 .",
    "esser and shisha @xcite construct a simple function @xmath54 defined on an open set of @xmath55 which is not everywhere differentiable on any neighborhood of 0 but which is strongly differentiable at @xmath56 .",
    "then @xmath57 satisfies the assumptions of our theorem but not those of peano s .",
    "let @xmath58 .",
    "since @xmath14 is partially strongly differentiable with respect to @xmath11 at @xmath16 there is @xmath59 such that for every @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , we have @xmath65 given @xmath30 let @xmath59 be as above .",
    "let @xmath66 be such that @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and let @xmath69 be such that @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , let them be such that @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "let @xmath73 , @xmath74 , be arbitrary and such that @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "let @xmath77 , then by the existence of @xmath14 and by the mean value theorem there is @xmath78 , @xmath79 , such that @xmath80 equation ( [ ied ] ) holds for these values for @xmath81 , thus @xmath82 dividing by @xmath83 , setting @xmath84 and taking the limit @xmath85 we obtain @xmath86 which means that @xmath10 has partial strong differential with respect to @xmath27 at @xmath16 given by @xmath87 , that is @xmath17 .",
    "the concept of strong differentiation lead us to a satisfactory result which we can summarize as follows :    * if the strong derivative @xmath87 exists and it makes sense to consider the strong derivative @xmath88 ( that is , @xmath10 exists in a set which accumulates at @xmath16 ) then the latter exists and they coincide .",
    "we might also ask to what extent the equality of mixed partial derivatives holds for functions which admit those second derivatives almost everywhere .",
    "some important results have been obtained for convex functions .",
    "a well known result by alexandrov establishes that convex functions admit a generalized peano derivative of order 2 in the sense that for almost every @xmath27 @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a linear map and @xmath44 is a quadratic form .",
    "less clear is whether @xmath44 can be obtained from the differentiation of the generalized differential of @xmath18 and whether such double differentiation gives a symmetric hessian .",
    "the affirmative answer to this question has been established by rockafellar @xcite .",
    "the russian mathematician g.  p.  tolstov clarified several questions related to the equality of mixed derivatives in two papers published in 1949 .",
    "unfortunately , only one of those articles was translated into english @xcite , so that the interesting results contained in the other paper @xcite have been largely overlooked by the mathematical community .",
    "most space in those papers is devoted to the construction of counterexamples .",
    "in fact , he proved @xcite :    * there exists a function @xmath91 , the mixed second derivatives of which exist at every point of @xmath15 but such that @xmath92 on a set @xmath93 of positive measure .",
    "* there exists a function @xmath91 , the mixed second derivatives of which exist almost everywhere in @xmath15 and such that @xmath94 almost everywhere in @xmath15 .    on the positive direction he improved young s theorem as follows @xcite :    * if the function @xmath18 has all second derivatives everywhere in @xmath15 , then the equality of mixed derivatives holds in @xmath15 .    this theorem with _ existence _ replaced by _ existence almost everywhere _ in both the hypothesis and thesis had been already proved by currier @xcite .",
    "these type of results have still an undesirable feature , for they place conditions on the existence of the double derivatives @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "actually , tolstov obtained some results which do not place conditions on the homogeneous second derivatives . in the remainder of this work we shall review and develop them .",
    "in particular , we shall stress the importance for applications of the lipschitz conditions on the first derivatives .",
    "we start with an important lemma from tolstov s paper .",
    "since there are no published english translations , we provide the proof .",

    "thus @xmath275 from the arbitrariness of @xmath276 , @xmath277 and @xmath278 we obtain that @xmath247 is @xmath231-lipschitz for every chosen value of @xmath11 .",
    "the remaining claims follow trivially from theorem [ jun ] .",
    "we stress that if @xmath279 then the fact that @xmath238 is lipschitz in @xmath11 uniformly in @xmath27 , and that @xmath239 is lipschitz in @xmath27 uniformly in @xmath11 , does not guarantee that @xmath280 ; it is sufficient to consider the function @xmath281 . as a consequence ,",
    "the assumptions of this theorem are weaker than @xmath282 .    for the @xmath283 case the equality of mixed derivatives",
    "can also be obtained as a consequence of young s ( point 3 above ) and rademacher s theorems .",
    "we recall that the latter states that every lipschitz function is almost everywhere differentiable @xcite . indeed :    [ nde ] let @xmath284 , @xmath285 , then @xmath18 is twice differentiable almost everywhere and in such differentiability set @xmath286 .",
    "the differential @xmath287 is lipschitz thus differentiable almost everywhere ( rademacher s theorem ) .",
    "if @xmath41 belongs to the differentiability set then @xmath14 and @xmath10 , being components of the differential , are there differentiable . thus by young s theorem 3 .",
    "we have @xmath286 at @xmath41 .",
    "in this section we explore some applications that motivated our study .",
    "they are in the area of differential geometry but it is likely that many other applications can be found .",
    "a rather natural application of these results is in the study of lipschitz 1-forms , namely 1-forms with lipschitz coefficients , over differentiable manifolds ( at least @xmath235 ) .",
    "indeed , some related results have been already developed following paths independent of the above considerations .    if @xmath288 then by theorem [ nde ] @xmath289 almost everywhere in the lebesgue 2-dimensional measure of any 2-dimensional @xmath235 embedded manifold .",
    "thus the exterior differential satisfies @xmath290 in a well defined sense whenever 0-forms and 1-forms are taken with the correct degree of differentiability .",
    "in particular , if @xmath291 is a lipschitz 1-form then stokes theorem @xmath292 still holds true @xcite .",
    "one also expects that lipschitz distributions of hyperplanes should be integrable according to the usual rule for @xmath257 distributions .",
    "namely , let @xmath291 be a lipschitz 1-form , then the distribution @xmath293 should be integrable if and only if @xmath294",
    ". this result has indeed been proved @xcite .",
    "the nice behavior of locally lipschitz 1-forms suggests to study riemannian @xmath23 manifolds endowed with lipschitz connections @xmath295 and @xmath235 metrics .",
    "indeed , in cartan s approach the connection is regarded as a lie algebra - valued 1-form in the bundle of reference frames . in such framework the riemannian tensor would be a locally bounded element of @xmath296 and hence would be defined only almost everywhere in the lebesgue 2-dimensional measure . in particular , it could be discontinuous though locally bounded .",
    "this feature would be quite appreciated in the theory of einstein s general relativity . there",
    "the ricci tensor is proportional to the stress - energy tensor and so it is necessarily discontinuous for the typical mass distribution of a planet ; the reader may consider the discontinuity in density which takes place at the planet s boundary .",
    "as mentioned , the assumptions of theorem [ thr ] are weaker than the condition @xmath297 .",
    "we wish to describe shortly an example of application where those weaker conditions turn out to be important .    in einstein s",
    "general relativity the spacetime continuum is represented with a lorentzian manifold @xcite , namely a differentiable manifold endowed with a metric of signature @xmath298 .",
    "observers or massive particles are represented by @xmath257 curves @xmath299 which are timelike , namely such that @xmath300 .",
    "unfortunately , for various mathematical arguments it is necessary to consider limits of such curves , and those limits are rarely @xmath257 but are necessarily lipschitz .",
    "lipschitz mathematical objects arise quite naturally in general relativity , ultimately because the light cones on spacetime ( at @xmath301 the light cone is given by the subset of @xmath302 where @xmath303 vanishes ) place a bound on the local speed of massive objects .    a typical problem which is met in the discussion of the clock effect ( or twin paradox ) deals with curve variations @xmath304 of timelike geodesics @xmath305 parametrized by @xmath306 , where the transverse curves @xmath307 are just lipschitz .",
    "in this situation the properties of the exponential map allow one to prove that the tangent @xmath308 is lipschitz in @xmath306 uniformly in @xmath309 , exactly the assumptions of theorem [ thr ] ( the function need not be differentiable in @xmath306 ) . it turns out that in order to prove formulas such as the first variation formula for the energy functional of differential geometry , @xmath310=\\frac{1}{2 } \\int_0 ^ 1 g(\\dot x , \\dot x ) { { \\rm d}}t,\\ ] ] one needs to switch @xmath311 for @xmath312 an operation which is indeed allowed thanks to theorem [ thr ] .",
    "thus , this theorem can be used to operate with lipschitz curves in lorentzian ( or riemannian ) geometry much in the same way as it is usually done with @xmath257 curves @xcite .",
    "we have reviewed the notion of strong differentiation and mikusiski s result on the equality of mixed partial derivatives .",
    "the assumptions do not demand the existence and continuity of any second derivative in a neighborhood of the point .",
    "rather , the theorem assumes the weaker notion of strong differentiability of one first derivative at the point .",
    "this possibility was suggested by previous applications of the concept of strong differentiation where it proved to be particularly advantageous , e.g.  the inverse function theorem .",
    "we have then considered results which prove the existence and equality of mixed partial derivatives almost everywhere .",
    "we have presented and elaborated previous results by tolstov stressing the importance of the lipschitz condition on first partial derivatives for applications .",
    "the advantage of this approach over alternative distributional approaches becomes clear whenever one can not conclude that both mixed second partial derivatives are summable .",
    "we have ended this work giving a specific example of application where this classical approach is more effective and justified .",
