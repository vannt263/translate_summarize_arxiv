    "the study of synchronization in large oscillator networks has been a thriving field of research ever since the classic work by winfree in 1967 @xcite .",
    "even so , there are still basic questions that await satisfactory answers .",
    "one such question is when and how macroscopic synchronization occurs in lattices of non - identical oscillators .",
    "this is the subject of the present paper .",
    "part of the charm of the study of synchronization is that the applications are very diverse @xcite .",
    "rhythmic activities in living organisms are , in many cases , generated by the collective oscillation of a large , synchronized assembly of pacemaker cells .",
    "examples include the beating of the heart @xcite , locomotion @xcite , the circadian rhythm @xcite , and the peristaltis of the small intestine @xcite . there is also growing evidence that large - scale synchronization among neurons is crucial in the interpretation of sensory data and in conscious perception @xcite .",
    "epileptic seizures correspond to an abnormal degree of synchronization @xcite . on a larger scale",
    ", synchronization can be seen in groups of organisms .",
    "swarms of fireflies may flash in unison @xcite , the chirping of crickets in a field waxes and wanes in partial synchrony @xcite , an audience may spontaneously start to clap in unison @xcite , females living together synchronize their menstrual cycles @xcite . it has also been realized that synchronization is an essential concept in the dynamics of spatially extended animal populations @xcite .",
    "examples from outside biology include synchronization in power grids @xcite , among lasers @xcite , oscillatory chemical reactions @xcite and in arrays of josephson junctions @xcite .    in most applications , there will inevitably be some variation among the oscillators , for instance in the _ natural frequency _ with which they oscillate when isolated .",
    "in this situation , macroscopic synchronization means that the order parameter @xmath7 becomes non - zero , where @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is the size of the largest group of oscillators that attain the same mean frequency and @xmath10 is the total number of oscillators .",
    "if the network has spatial structure , the @xmath9 synchronized oscillators typically form a percolating cluster @xcite .",
    "the mean frequency @xmath11 of oscillator @xmath12 is defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the phase of @xmath12 .",
    "the existence of the above limits has to be assumed @xcite .    in theoretical work",
    ", the description of each oscillator must be simple to enable the study of large networks .",
    "kuramoto and others @xcite introduced the so called phase reduction technique , and showed that in the limits of small coupling between oscillators and small variation of natural frequencies , the phase @xmath14 is sufficient to describe the state of each oscillator @xmath12 , and the network dynamics is given by @xmath15 the constant @xmath16 is the natural frequency , @xmath1 is the coupling strength , and @xmath17 is a 1-periodic function .",
    "another situation where a phase description is sufficient is in the limits of short , pulse - like interactions and strong dissipation .",
    "the quick reduction of phase space volumes then ensures that after one perturbation from a nearby oscillator @xmath18 , oscillator @xmath12 returns close to its limit cycle before the next perturbation , and we may write @xmath19\\varphi_{lk}(\\phi_{k } ) , \\label{pulsemodel}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the dirac delta function .",
    "this is often a good description in biological applications , where the interactions , for instance , may consist of electric discharges or light flashes .",
    "if we define @xmath14 as a cyclic variable , @xmath21 , we can replace @xmath22 $ ] with @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath24-periodic function @xmath17 is often called the _ phase response curve_.    transitions to macroscopic synchronization are similar to phase transitions in equilibrium systems . the two main methods to analyze phase transitions are to make a mean - field description or to use a renormalization group .",
    "so far , most attempts to gain understanding of macroscopic synchronization among non - identical oscillators have assumed that the oscillators are coupled all - to - all .",
    "this is the mean - field description . to use a renormalization group , on the other hand ,",
    "is the natural way to gain understanding of phase transitions in lattices .",
    "this is the method used in this study .",
    "a real - space renormalization scheme is developed that is potentially exact .",
    "it is tested numerically on two structurally different models . at its present stage of development",

    "perfectly odd coupling must be regarded as a non - generic special case , except for particular problems that can be mapped onto kuramoto - like models , such as josephson junction arrays @xcite .",

    "the data presented in this paper should be seen as an initial overview of the behavior of some relevant quantities . a more detailed study of each quantity is needed .",
    "in particular , the number of realizations of natural periods has to be increased .    to put the theory to further test",
    ", it goes without saying that simulations of oscillator lattices with dimensions other than @xmath71 are called for .",
    "perhaps the quantities used in this paper can be used to find an answer to the long standing question whether there is a transition to macroscopic synchronization in the three - dimensional kuramoto model .",
    "it is worth noting that the relevance of the second critical coupling @xmath242 is established in this study .",
    "it was first described in ref .",
    "@xcite , but there a density function @xmath29 of natural frequencies with finite support was used . here , i find that it is present even if @xmath29 has tails .",
    "it is therefore a more generic transition than that to @xmath496 in the globally coupled kuramoto or winfree models @xcite , appearing when @xmath29 has no tails .",
    "the nature of the transition at @xmath242 is a subject for future work , and the question whether there is an additional non - trivial fixed point associated with this transition is left unanswered .",
    "theory and numerics taken together indicate that the renormalization flow goes towards increasing @xmath1 for @xmath282 ( fig .",
    "[ rfig20 ] ) .",
    "i judge that both phase 2 and phase 3 are supercritical , and in section [ rflow ] i give a technical argument why this is so . here , a qualitative argument is presented why an oscillator lattice can not be subcritical above @xmath187 , that is , why correlation functions can not have exponential tails , corresponding to finite correlation lenghts .",
    "correlation lengths relate to the typical distance a perturbation or fluctuation spreads .",
    "let us compare with the ising model , which is subcritical both above and below the critical temperature @xmath497 . in the ordered phase below @xmath497 , most spins are aligned .",
    "let us introduce a perturbation in the form of a spin with opposite direction .",
    "such a spin increases the probability that a neighbor spin will also flip .",
    "the perturbation tends to spread .",
    "however , the lower the temperature , the smaller the probability that the neighbor will flip , according to the boltzmann distribution .",
    "thus , a typical perturbation spreads shorter distances , and the correlation length drops .",
    "the situation is quite different in the ordered phase of an oscillator lattice , where i am thinking mainly of states with partial frequency synchronization ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "a perturbation in such a lattice corresponds to an oscillator @xmath12 that runs at a different frequency .",
    "this perturbation spreads to the rest of the lattice via the coupling functions , which will not vary with the entrained frequency . assume for simplicity that the coupling has the form @xmath498 .",
    "the peak magnitude of this perturbation can only increase with @xmath1 , since the argument takes on all values in the range @xmath499 because @xmath500 and @xmath11 are assumed to be different . thus ,",
    "if the correlation lengths are infinite at a critical coupling @xmath187 , they should stay infinite even if @xmath282 .    in conclusion ,",
    "i hope that this study will inspire further theoretical and numerical work on macroscopic synchronization in oscillator lattices .",
    "unfortunately , the understanding of these systems has fallen way behind the understanding of globally coupled oscillator networks",
    ". a better understanding of oscillator lattices should also promote the understanding of transitions to macroscopic synchronization in complex networks , since the topology of these often can be seen as lying in between the topologies of the lattice and the fully connected network .",
