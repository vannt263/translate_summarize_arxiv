    "for any number of minimally coupled scalar fields , the most general form of the no hair theorem , in asymptotically flat spacetimes , states that when the scalar field potential is everywhere non - negative then there are no non - trivial regular black hole spacetimes ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , to have an asymptotically flat hairy black hole with a minimally coupled scalar field a necessary condition is a scalar field potential with a negative region . in @xcite a family of static , spherically symmetric solution of the einstein field equations with a minimally coupled scalar field @xmath0 with a non - trivial potential @xmath1 was found and analyzed . for a whole range of the parameters this solution describes either asymptotically flat or ( anti ) de sitter black holes .",
    "the main subject of the present paper is to analyze the mode stability of the asymptotically flat black holes , whose properties are summarized in section i below . the scalar field potential in the asymptotically flat case is depicted in figure  [ fig : potandres ] .",
    "the question of mode stability is already non - trivial for vacuum solutions , which was settled in the static case by regge - wheeler and zerilli ( for references and an account of these results see @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown in these seminal works that the stability problem can be mapped to the analysis of the spectrum of a schrdinger operator .",
    "an everywhere positive spectrum implies there are no modes which exponentially grow in time .",
    "since , as can be seen from figure  fig : potandres , the potential @xmath1 is not bounded from below one would thus expect that something should go very wrong with the stability of the solution .",

    "we will see that the effective potential @xmath2 in which these modes @xmath3 propagate , @xmath4where @xmath5 is a tortoise \" radial coordinate sending the horizon at minus infinity , always exhibits a negative region .",
    "a sufficient condition for the existence of bound states with negative @xmath6 ( for bounded @xmath7 that fall - off faster than @xmath8 )  is the simon criteria @xcite , which states that whenever the integral    @xmath9    is negative there will always be at least one bound state with negative @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , we only study effective potentials with a positive simon integral . using standard shooting \" techniques to solve ( [ schroe ] ) ,",
    "we do indeed find unstable modes .",
    "what is remarkable however is that this instability is somehow marginal . indeed , as we shall comment upon in section  [ sec : savethephenomena ] , there is only a finite number of unstable modes and , moreover , as follows from the sharp lieb - thirring inequality in one dimension hundertmark:1998cz , their characteristic time of growth can be made arbitrarily large for certain values of the black holes parameters , as is the case if the size of the black hole is small enough .",

    "we therefore see that this condition is met if @xmath45 and @xmath47 $ ] in which case the mass and size of the black hole are related by @xmath166such black holes are therefore marginally stable , that is , long - lived \" .",
    "we studied in this paper the stability of the asymptotically flat black holes with minimally coupled scalar hair discovered in  @xcite .",
    "we limited ourselves to the analysis of the radial s - wave \" perturbations of the metric and the scalar field , which can be presumed to be the least stable ( since a stabilizing barrier in @xmath167 appears in the effective potential of @xmath168 modes ) .",
    "we found that , generically , some of these radial modes were spatially bounded but growing in time . strictly speaking the black holes are therefore unstable .",
    "however , if their mass @xmath164 and size @xmath67 are small compared with the scale @xmath163 of the model the characteristic time for the instability to develop is long compared to the scale set by @xmath164 .",
    "a final remark is in order .",
    "since the potential for the scalar field is unbounded from below , it is tempting to say that the instability could have been foreseen without any detailed analysis .",
    "however this would have been a hasty conclusion ( as the well - known example of anti - de sitter spacetime already teaches us  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , when a proper cosmological term is added to the potential , leaving it unbounded from below ( see  andrespapers1 , andrespapers2 , andrespapers3 for its expression ) , so that the black hole is asymptotically anti - de sitter , it is easy to see that the effective potential @xmath7 for the perturbations can be _ positive _ everywhere , so that the black hole is linearly stable against radial perturbations .",
    "we leave a thorough study of this promising case to further work .",
