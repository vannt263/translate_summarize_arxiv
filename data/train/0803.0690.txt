    "possibly inspired by the latter , c.  loewner started thinking about systolic questions on surfaces in the late forties , resulting in a  50 thesis by his student p.m. pu , published as @xcite .",
    "loewner himself did not publish his torus inequality  , apparently leaving it to pu to pursue this line of research .",
    "meanwhile , the latter was recalled to the mainland after the communists ousted chiang kai - shek in 49 .",
    "pu was henceforth confined to research in fuzzy topology in the service of the people .",
    "our guess is that pu may have otherwise obtained a geometric inequality with isosystolic defect , already half a century ago , placing it among the classics of the global geometry of surfaces .",
    "similarly to the isoperimetric inequality , loewner s torus inequality relates the total area , to a suitable  @xmath3-dimensional invariant , namely the systole , _",

    "there is no defect term in either @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the approach that has been used in the literature is via an integral identity expressing area in terms of energies of loops .",
    "somehow researchers in the field seem to have overlooked the fact that the computational formula for the variance yields an improvement , namely the defect term .",
    "there is thus a significant change of focus , from the integral geometric identity , to the application of the computational formula , elementary though it may be .",

    "then the inequality with the defect term can be written as follows : @xmath16 here the error term , or _ isosystolic defect _ , is given by the variance @xmath17 of the conformal factor  @xmath15 of the metric  @xmath18 on the torus , relative to the unit area flat metric  @xmath19 in the same conformal class . here",

    "when the flat metric is that of the unit square torus , loewner s inequality can be strengthened to the inequality @xmath34 . in this case , if the conformal factor depends only on one variable ( as , for example , in the case of surfaces of revolution ) , one can strengthen the inequality further by providing a second defect term as follows : @xmath35 where  @xmath36 , while  @xmath37 is the expected value of  @xmath15 , and @xmath38 is the  @xmath39-norm .",
