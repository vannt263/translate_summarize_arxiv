    "grs 1915 + 105 is a galactic black - hole binary with a number of highly interesting and unique properties .",
    "it is a long - lived transient , which outburst began in 1992 @xcite and is still lasting .",
    "it was the first galactic source discovered to show superluminal motion ( @xcite , hereafter mr94 ) .",
    "it is unusually highly variable in x - rays ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and it is one of the intrinsically brightest galactic x - ray binaries , occasionally radiating above the eddington limit @xcite . the minimum jet power in the superluminal ejection in 1994 was claimed to be highly super - eddington @xcite .    here , we reconsider the minimum kinetic jet power , the mass flow rate , and the total energy and mass of the major mass ejections of grs 1915 + 105 observed in 1994 ( mr94 ) and in 1997 ( @xcite , hereafter f99 ) .",
    "we use the method developed in @xcite ( hereafter z14 ) .",
    "it minimizes the kinetic jet power associated with both the jet internal energy content and the ion rest mass , correcting some earlier estimates .",
    "we note , in particular , that finding the minimum comoving energy , adding the associated ions and transforming to the observer frame does not give the minimum of the power ( z14 ) .",
    "the jet power becomes extremely high close to the maximum kinematically allowed distance for a given ejection , but it also decreases very fast with the decreasing distance .",
    "recently , the black - hole mass and distance to grs 1915 + 105 were measured by @xcite ( hereafter s13 ) .",
    "we use their results to derive a distance - dependent estimate of the black - hole mass .",
    "we also use their measurement of the donor radius to derive a constraint on the distance .",
    "the jet inclination , @xmath1 , and the velocity , @xmath2 , can be measured using the angular velocities of the approaching and receding condensations , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , under the assumption that the ejections were symmetric ( mr94 ) .",
    "we have the relationships , @xmath5^{1/2 } } , \\label{incl_gamma}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the source distance and @xmath7 is the jet lorentz factor .",
    "[ note that @xmath8 , which can be used in equations ( [ q_r2][mbh ] ) below for a given measurement of @xmath9 . ] from @xmath10 , we see there is the maximum possible distance , @xmath11 , corresponding to @xmath12 .",
    "the doppler factors , @xmath13 , of the approaching and receding ejecta are , @xmath14^{1/2}\\!,\\quad \\delta_{\\rm r}=\\delta_{\\rm a}{\\mu_{\\rm r}\\over \\mu_{\\rm a}}= \\left[{\\mu_{\\rm r}\\over \\mu_{\\rm a}}\\left(1-{d^2\\over c^2}\\mu_{\\rm a}\\mu_{\\rm r}\\right)\\right]^{1/2}\\ ! , \\label{delta}\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "we then calculate the source - frame spectral luminosity from the approaching blob at @xmath15 as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the measured flux of the approaching blob at @xmath18 .",
    "we note that mr94 and f99 found that the observed ratios between the fluxes of the approaching and receding ejecta are somewhat lower than the ratio , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the energy spectral index ( @xmath21 ) , implied by equation ( [ lum ] ) .",
    "then , based on the results of mr94 only , @xcite proposed that the ejections were not intrinsically symmetric , which could explain the lower observed flux ratio .",
    "this seems not confirmed by the results of f99 , who also found a lower flux ratio .",
    "the ratio could be lower if the emission were from continuous jet and counterjet @xcite .",
    "however , the radio images , showing individual blobs , of mr94 and f99 appear not to be compatible with that",
    ". we will use equation ( [ lum ] ) , bearing in mind this issue as a caveat .",
    "since the obtained values of @xmath22 are close to unity for the values of @xmath6 we determine , a possible error due to this assumption is insignificant .",
    "hereafter , we use the standard propagation of errors to calculate the uncertainties on the obtained quantities .     allowed by this criterion is @xmath23 kpc .",

    "( c ) the black - hole mass obtained using the mass function of s13 .",
    "the meaning of the curves is the same as in the panel ( a ) . , width=234 ]    we consider two major ejection events from grs 1915 + 105 which began on 1994 march 19 ( mr94 ) and 1997 october 29 ( f99 ) .",
    "their measured angular velocities were @xmath24 mas d@xmath25 ( as updated in @xcite ) , and @xmath26 mas d@xmath25 , and @xmath27 mas d@xmath25 , and @xmath28 mas d@xmath25 , respectively .",
    "in addition , three more events with both @xmath3 and @xmath4 measured are listed by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the implied values of the inclination are consistent with being the same for all five events , though the additional three have much larger uncertainties . in particular , the values implied by the radial velocities for 1994 march and 1997 october are @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , at @xmath32 , 10 and 9 kpc , respectively .",
    "note that the stated uncertainties on @xmath9 , and thus on @xmath33 , are significantly lower for the former event than for the latter .",
    "s13 argued , based on the results of @xcite ( who corrected a numerical error by a factor of 50 in the alignment time scale given by @xcite ) , that the axes of the jet and the binary plane in grs 1915 + 105 are likely aligned , which assumption is also commonly adopted in other estimates of the binary parameters of grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "still , the possibility of a misalignment should be kept in mind , given the lack of full understanding of the alignment process .",
    "assuming alignment , the jet is not precessing , and its inclination angle remains the same for all the observations .",
    "thus , we calculate the weighted average of the inclination and its standard error , though we note that it is strongly dominated by the two major events .",
    "[ binary](a ) shows the values of @xmath1 and its uncertainty for the two major events separately and for the average as a function of the distance .",
    "we then consider the implications for the binary parameters .",
    "we use the recent results of s13 , who obtained the orbital period of @xmath34 d , the velocity semi - amplitude of @xmath35 km s@xmath25 , and the rotational broadening of the donor of @xmath36 km s@xmath25 . assuming corotation and the donor filling the roche lobe",
    ", we have the standard formulae for the mass ratio , @xmath37 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the radius of the donor , @xmath38 , @xmath39 respectively , where the roche lobe radius ratio for @xmath40 of @xcite has been used . the equation for @xmath41 yields a cubic - polynomial solution , which gives @xmath42 ( s13 ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath38 is a function of @xmath1 , which we show in fig .",
    "[ binary](b ) .",
    "the black hole mass is @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "s13 used the inclination range of f99 .",
    "as we note above , it is significantly less accurate than that of mr94 .",
    "also , s13 gave their mass estimate including the entire distance - related inclination uncertainty of f99 .",
    "[ binary](c ) shows instead the range of @xmath45 as a function of the distance and using the weighted average of the inclination from the available mass - ejection events .",
    "we then consider the distance .",
    "the maximum kinematic distances for the 1994 and 1997 events are @xmath46 kpc , @xmath47 kpc , respectively , and thus the latter gives the current upper limit .",
    "the distance implied by the radial systemic velocity is @xmath48 kpc ( s13 ) . @xcite",
    "considered the distance implied by the theoretical k - star surface brightness compared to the observed magnitude , see their equation ( 1 ) .",
    "this yields the angular diameter of the secondary as @xmath490.0220 mas .",
    "the corresponding physical radius of the secondary is @xmath50 .",
    "the minimum @xmath38 as a function of @xmath6 allowed by the minimum @xmath51 above is plotted by the magenta dashed line in fig .",
    "[ binary](b ) .",
    "we see that the distance compatible with this constraint is @xmath0 kpc .",
    "finally , the new parallax distance from radio vlba measurements is @xmath52 kpc @xcite . combining the above determinations , we find the likely distance range as @xmath5310 kpc .",
    "this is somewhat less than the distance of 11 kpc preferred by @xcite because now both the current measurement of @xmath54 of s13 is lower than the previous one by @xcite and the determination of the systemic - velocity distance by s13 is lower than the previous one by @xcite .",
    "our current range of @xmath6 is still compatible with other observational constraints listed in @xcite .",
    "also , a value of @xmath6 significantly less than 11 kpc is implied by considering the jet kinetic power , as we show below .",
    "the values of @xmath45 for our preferred values of @xmath6 are then somewhat higher than @xmath55 given as the best estimate by s13 , see fig .  [ binary](c ) .",

    "also , our definition of the jet power is different , see z14 , and the method different , as they assumed a fixed frequency - integrated synchrotron luminosity . taking into account those differences , our results are fully consistent with those of @xcite .",
    "they claimed the 1994 flare had to be strongly super - eddington .",
    "however , as we discuss above , the current limit on @xmath6 is @xmath47 kpc ( f99 ) , and @xmath85 decreases rather fast with decreasing @xmath6 , which we show below . thus , their results are no longer applicable to grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "we then compare our results for the 1997 flare with those of f99 . at @xmath32 kpc ,",
    "we obtain @xmath90 erg s@xmath25 with the uniform model , which is a factor of @xmath91 higher than the corresponding estimate of f99 ( multiplying the power given in their table 3 by 2 , see their section 4.1.3 ) .",
    "one reason for the discrepancy is their method being incorrect , as discussed in z14 .",
    "furthermore , f99 divided the energy content in electrons by the flare rise time , which gives the power averaged over that time rather than the instantaneous power at the moment of the measurement of the peak synchrotron flux .",

    "we see that @xmath85 for the pair model is a factor of a few less than for the ionic one",
    ". however , as argued , e.g. , by @xcite and @xcite ( though , as a caveat , see @xcite ) , jets in x - ray binaries likely contain hadrons rather than pure pairs . the minimum jet+counterjet power and the corresponding magnetic field strength using the gaussian model ( used hereafter ) for the 1994 flare at 10 kpc are @xmath93 erg s@xmath25 , @xmath94 g for the cosmic abundances and @xmath95 erg s@xmath25 , @xmath96 g for e@xmath67 pairs . for the 1997 flare at 10 kpc",

    "we find the ratio of the jet power in electrons to that in ions of @xmath101 , 0.08 for the 1994 and 1997 flare , respectively .",
    "these estimates are thus insensitive to the assumed source radius , which is the case for the ionic power dominating ( z14 ) .",
    "indeed , the values of the critical radius below which the solution becomes independent of @xmath102 ( z14 ) are @xmath103 cm , @xmath104 cm for the 1994 and 1997 flares , respectively , which are @xmath105 our values of @xmath102 .",
    "we note that a possible clumpiness of the jet material , as quantified by the clump volume filling factor , @xmath106 , can reduce the minimum jet power by a factor of @xmath107 in the case of the dominant ionic power , and @xmath108 for the case of pair plasma ( z14 ) .",
    "if , e.g. , @xmath109 , the minimum power can be reduced by a factor of several .",
    "[ power1915 ] shows that the kinetic jet power critically depends on the actual distance to grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "we can compare it to the bolometric luminosity of grs 1915 + 105 , dominated by accretion .",
    "the results of @xcite and @xcite show that the jet kinetic power in agns is strongly correlated with both the accretion rate and the bolometric luminosity , @xmath110 .",
    "in particular , @xcite find the correlation of @xmath111 , where @xmath59 is the eddington luminosity .",
    "thus , we expect @xmath112 at @xmath113 .",
    "furthermore , results of @xcite and @xcite show that the same underlying relationship between jets and accretion flow is present in both agns and black - hole binaries .",
    "indeed , the jet power of cyg x-1 estimated by @xcite satisfies the correlation of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the jet power of cyg x-3 in its bright state has been estimated based on a model of its @xmath114-ray emission and found @xmath115 , consistent with the above correlation @xcite .",
    "the _ rxte_/asm monitoring shows the x - ray state during the 1997 event ( f99 ) was among the brightest ones observed from this source , which implies that its maximum bolometric luminosity was then moderately super - eddington , @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "thus , based on the above considerations , we may expect ( but not prove ) the jet kinetic power to be approximately sub - eddington .",
    "[ power1915 ] shows that the 1994 and 1997 jets are sub - eddington provided @xmath117 kpc and 8.8 kpc , respectively , using the ionic model with the gaussian density distribution . in the case of pair plasma ,",

    "( similar values are found for the 1997 flare . )",
    "the peak 8.6-ghz flux , corresponding to @xmath127 , was thus achieved earlier than on 1994 march 24 , and the minimum power at that time was higher . on the other hand ,",
    "the blob expanded after march 24 , which caused the electrons to cool adiabatically , and also reduced the magnetic field strength .",
    "the synchrotron luminosity should then decrease , and the fluxes in table 1 of mr94 are consistent with this .",
    "when we apply the minimum jet power method to those later stages , we find the minimum total power decreasing . on the other hand",
    ", there was no evidence for deceleration in those data ( mr94 ; see also @xcite ) , which implies that the power in ions ( dominating the power in particles in our case ) kept constant .",
    "thus , the further evolution of the source had to be characterized by a decrease of the jet equipartition parameter of @xmath128 ( @xmath129 for the minimum power at the initial observation ) .",
    "this shows that the actual jet power is likely to be higher than the minimum one .",
    "we have calculated the minimum jet power for the major mass ejection events of grs 1915 + 105 in 1994 and 1997 .",
    "we have taken into account the power component associated with the ion bulk motion , which we have found to dominate , and which was neglected in an earlier estimate .",
    "we have found the jet power becomes very high close to the maximum allowed kinematically for a given ejection event . on the other hand ,",
    "it becomes much lower and in agreement with the average relationship between the jet power and the bolometric luminosity for accreting black holes at a distance @xmath0 kpc .",
