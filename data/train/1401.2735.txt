    "within the framework of the non - relativistic qcd factorization theory ( nrqcd ) , the heavy quarkonium production or decay can be factorized into a sum of products of short - distance coefficients and the non - perturbative but universal long - distance matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "the short - distance coefficients are perturbatively calculable , which can be expanded in a combined power series of the strong coupling constant ( @xmath18 ) and the relative velocity of the constituent quarks in the quarkonium rest frame @xmath19 .",
    "the top quark is too heavy to form a steady bound state before it decays , thus , the bottomonium is the heaviest and most compact bound state of quark - antiquark system within the standard model .",
    "both its typical coupling constant and relative velocity are smaller than those of charmonium . in general",
    ", the perturbative results for bottomonium will be more convergent over the expansion of @xmath18 and @xmath20 than the charmonium cases .",
    "thus , if at an experimental platform enough bottomonium events could be generated , it shall provide a relatively more confidential test of nrqcd .    at the @xmath21 factory , the bottomonium production via the channel @xmath22 with one - loop qcd correction has been studied  @xcite , where @xmath1 equals to @xmath2 or @xmath5 @xmath23 that has the charge - conjugation parity @xmath24 .",
    "because the bottomonium mass is close to the threshold of the @xmath21 factories as belle and babar , the emitted photons could be soft ( this is caused by the @xmath25 phase - space constraint ) .",
    "thus , the pqcd estimations on the bottomonium production at the @xmath21 factories may be questionable and some extra treatments have to be introduced in order to achieve a reliable pqcd estimation .",
    "for example , in ref.@xcite , an extra artificial phase - space factor has been suggested to suppress the singular contributions from the phase - space end - point region , e.g. @xmath26 for @xmath2 production and @xmath27 for @xmath5 production have been introduced accordingly . on the other hand ,",
    "the super @xmath7 factory , which runs at a much higher collision energy and with a high luminosity up to @xmath28  @xcite , provides a more reliable platform for studying the bottomonium properties .",
    "the bottomonium production via semi - exclusive channels as @xmath29 with @xmath30 or @xmath31 , has shown one of such examples  @xcite . moreover , in refs.@xcite , the authors concluded that a large amount of charmonium events can be produced via the charmonium plus photon channel at the super @xmath7 factory .",
    "it is natural to assume that we shall also observe enough bottomonium events at this platform .",
    "one can treat the bottomonium in a similar way as that of charmonium , however , it has its own properties and specific points , deserving a separate discussion .    for the purpose , we shall calculate the production channel @xmath32 with one - loop qcd correction .",
    "different to previous treatment  @xcite , where only the @xmath10-channel diagrams have been calculated , we shall discuss both the @xmath10-channel and @xmath13-channel diagrams , including their cross terms , so as to achieve a sound estimation .",
    "we shall show that the @xmath13-channel diagrams ( or roughly , the initial state radiation diagrams  @xcite ) can also provide sizable contributions . due to angular momentum conservation and bose statistics ( known as the landau - pomeranchuk - yang theorem  @xcite ) , those channels via @xmath33 propagator are forbidden , i.e. the @xmath10-channels of @xmath34 and the @xmath13-channels of @xmath35 .",
    "the color - octet contributions shall be greatly suppressed in comparison to the color - singlet cases , which mainly come from the suppression of the color - octet matrix element to the color - singlet matrix element , i.e. about @xmath36 suppression to the corresponding color - singlet matrix element  @xcite with @xmath37 being the relative velocity between the constituent quarks in bottomonium .",
    "in addition , at the present one - loop level , only real corrections are non - zero for the color - octet channels , so there are also extra phase - space and color- suppression to the color - singlet cases . in the present paper , we shall not take the color - octet quarkonium states into consideration",
    ".    the remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows . in sec.ii ,",

    "<S> we make a detailed discussion on the one - loop qcd correction to the bottomonium production associated with a photon , i.e. via the channel @xmath0 , where @xmath1 stands for the color - singlet bottomonium state as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 or @xmath5 ( @xmath6=0 , 1 or 2 ) , respectively . at the super @xmath7 factory with the collision energy @xmath8 , by summing up the cross sections for all bottomonium states , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a large one - loop qcd correction , i.e. @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this ensures the necessity and importance of the one - loop qcd corrections for the present processes . </S>",
    "<S> further more , for the @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 production , their cross sections are dominated by the @xmath10-channel diagrams and are enhanced by the @xmath11 boson resonance effect when @xmath12 . while , for the @xmath3 production , such resonance effect shall be smeared by a large @xmath13-channel contribution that dominant over the @xmath10-channel one . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical uncertainties caused by slight change of @xmath14 , the @xmath15-quark mass , the renormalization scale and etc . have been presented . at the super @xmath7 factory with a high luminosity up to @xmath16 , </S>",
    "<S> the bottomonium plus one photon events are sizable , especially for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which have large signal significance . </S>",
    "<S> summing up all bottomonium states , we shall totally have @xmath17 bottomonium events in one operation year . </S>",
