    "the study of the quasiparticle spectrum in the mixed state of @xmath14-wave superconductors followed soon @xcite after the @xmath14-wave nature of pairing in the cuprate superconductors became apparent .",
    "a distinct character of the tunneling local density of states ( tldos ) in @xmath15-wave and @xmath14-wave superconductors near a vortex was proposed by wang and macdonald to serve as a test which would allow determination of the pairing symmetry in the cuprates @xcite . for @xmath14-wave pairing",
    ", they found that the tldos at the vortex location plotted as a function of energy , exhibits a prominent peak at zero applied bias voltage , while in an @xmath15-wave case , for otherwise similar parameters of the model , the thermally broadened tldos has a minimum at @xmath16 surrounded by two large sub - gap peaks .",
    "while their calculations apply to densely packed vortices and unrealistically high magnetic fields in real cuprates , a similar conclusion concerning this `` zero - bias peak '' is obtained also within a single vortex calculation of franz and teanovi @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the stm experiments in bscco@xcite and ybco @xcite  now unambiguously known to be of a @xmath14-wave type  reveal that the `` zero - bias peak '' is completely absent .",
    "instead , the tunneling conductance experiences a dip at zero bias , and new relatively small sub - gap peaks at energies @xmath13 mev .",
    "to explain this discrepancy  which at the moment is unresolved ",
    "one usually relies on additional order parameters in the vortex cores .",
    "this line of thought advocates that due to the suppression of the superconducting order parameter within vortex cores , a new competing ( local ) order emerges there , which ultimately is responsible for the deviations from refs . .",
    "several different order parameters were considered in the literature : @xmath17 superconducting order@xcite , antiferromagnetic order @xcite , pseudogap state @xcite , circulating currents @xcite , d - density - wave @xcite .",
    "other explanations of the absent zbcp include the anisotropy of the tunneling matrix elements @xcite , and , most recently , quantum zero - point motion of vortices@xcite .",
    "in addition to the above `` high - energy , short - distance '' features of a vortex core  an interesting problem in its own",
    "right  the quest for a description of nodal quasiparticles within some simple low - energy effective hamiltonian , which would facilitate theoretical analysis , was launched as a separate line of inquiry .",
    "an effective description is important in order to address more complicated problems such as the interactions of fluctuating vortices with nodal @xmath14-wave quasiparticles or the effects of disorder in a nodal superconductor .",
    "the initial steps in this direction were taken by simon and lee @xcite who proposed that , after extracting the rapid `` @xmath18 '' oscillations of the wavefunctions , the `` linearized '' effective version of the bogoliubov - degennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian suggests a simple scaling ( [ simonleescaling ] ) for the low energy ( @xmath19 ) sector of the quasiparticle spectrum in the mixed state of type ii - superconductors , and consequently for various other measurable quantities .",
    "the scaling function was then calculated by franz and teanovi@xcite , who employed a singular gauge transformation ( ft transformation ) and expansion of the wavefunctions in the plane wave basis to find that the spectrum at the very low energies @xmath20 is essentially the same as the original spectrum of the zero - field problem , but for the renormalization of the slopes of the anisotropic dirac cones at the nodes .",
    "the linearized ft hamiltonian was subsequently analyzed both numerically and theoretically , using its symmetry properties , in refs . .",
    "further study , however , revealed several new questions . quite separately from its origin , the linearized hamiltonian turned out to be somewhat challenging to analyze due to singularities at vortex positions which rendered it incomplete unless its proper self - adjoint extension is constructed by imposing an additional boundary condition at each vortex@xcite . such boundary conditions , which turned out to be necessary in performing the numerical and symmetry analysis of the linearized hamiltonian , are discussed at length in a companion paper@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the relation of the linearized description to the tight - binding model also turned out to be somewhat more complex than initially anticipated : the simon - lee scaling of the quasiparticles energy eigenstates according to ( [ simonleescaling ] ) demands that if the spectrum is gapless on the linearized level  as found in ref . ",
    "the gaps of the full non - linearized problem must decrease as @xmath21 as a function of @xmath4 or faster in the limit of small magnetic fields .",
    "however , exact diagonalization of the non - linearized problem at zero chemical potential @xmath22 , showed@xcite that the gap in the spectrum oscillates between @xmath23 and @xmath24 , depending on the commensuration of the magnetic length to the atomic lattice spacing .",
    "perhaps the most telling manifestation of the intricate relation between the linearized continuum and the tight - binding lattice models of the mixed state is the exact result@xcite for the spectrum of the latter when @xmath22 and @xmath25 : in this case the number of the zero energy states is doubled compared to the zero magnetic field result .",
    "clearly , such doubling is difficult to account for if one uses the non - perturbed plane wave basis as the departure point for a perturbation theory .    here , we explore further the non - perturbative effects of the tight - binding ( tb ) model of a @xmath14-wave superconductor in the presence of a vortex lattice . in section",
    "ii we present the results of a systematic study of the spectrum for large magnetic lengths @xmath4 ( low magnetic fields , corresponding to realistic values in cuprates ) , up to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the lattice spacing , and for general @xmath28 .",
    "we start by focusing on the _ low - energy properties of the spectrum _ and analyze the validity simon - lee scaling for this model .",
    "the dispersion is shown to obey the scaling on _ average _ , and in general to experience rapid oscillations of the energy levels as a function of both the magnetic field and @xmath28 .",
    "these anomalous oscillations , which can be unified within a new generalized form of simon - lee scaling , are described by an additional dependence of the energy levels on the commensuration of the inter - nodal distance and magnetic length @xmath4 .",
    "the inadequacy of the simon - lee scaling in its conventional form is shown to be the result of the singular nature of the bdg eigenfunctions combined with the inter - nodal interference , as conjectured in refs . .",
    "the linearized effective hamiltonian is argued to still accurately represent the low energy sector of the theory , but the necessary condition is stricter than anticipated earlier and demands also @xmath29 rather than only @xmath30 .    in section iii",
    "we describe the _ high - energy , short - distance features of the spectrum_. we find that although the tldos is indeed peaked at the four sites of the tight - binding lattice surrounding the vortex , in agreement with previous work , the four immediate neighbors are rather an exception than a rule : all sites in the proximity of the vortex  _ except _ the nearest neighbors  exhibit no zero - bias peak , and furthermore have additional peaks at sub - gap energies . in the concluding section ,",
    "we discuss how the on - site peak can be suppressed and argue that the @xmath31 mev peaks observed in stm experiments could in fact be due to regular @xmath14-wave vortices , but with a particular profile for the amplitude of @xmath14-wave gap function on those few bonds constituting the cores .",
    "the anomalous enhancement of the inter - nodal interference by singular potential due to vortices has also a prominent effect on a related single vortex problem , i.e. , an isolated superconducting grain of size @xmath10 in a commensurate magnetic field @xmath32 , where the elementary flux @xmath33 equals @xmath34 , pierced by a single vortex .",
    "this is discussed in detail in section iv , where we show that although the spectrum has oscillations of the low energy levels of magnitude proportional @xmath12 even in zero magnetic field due to finite - size effects , in the presence of the vortex the periodicity of these oscillations is doubled .",
    "we start from the bogoliubov - degennes(bdg ) hamiltonian @xmath35 of the model @xcite , which is defined by its action on a two - component bogoliubov - nambu wavefunction @xmath36 as @xmath37 in the simplest case , the hopping and pairing fields described by @xmath38 and @xmath39 are nonzero only on the nearest neighbor bonds , and in the presence of magnetic field @xmath40 , the hopping @xmath41 is modified by peierls factors @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the vector potential corresponding to magnetic field @xmath40 .",
    "the pairing field / gap function @xmath39 should in principle be determined from a self - consistent procedure stemming from the same microscopic hamiltonian that in the mean - field approximation yielded ( [ tb_ham_start ] ) . for example , in the simplest model that results in the @xmath14-wave order within the mean - field approximation for a wide range of parameters  the extended hubbard model with the nearest neighbors density - density attraction @xmath44  the self - consistency condition reads @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the temperature and @xmath47 are the eigenstates of the bdg hamiltonian of energy @xmath48 . while incorporating the self - consistency condition",
    "is not an impossible task , the results to a certain extent will depend on the microscopic model , from which the condition was derived .    in the context of the superconductivity in cuprates",
    ", however , such dependence is very weak : the amplitude of the order parameter @xmath49 recovers rapidly to its uniform state value @xmath50 , while the phase is subject to the condition of overall winding by @xmath8 along any lattice path enclosing a vortex .",
    "these two conditions suggest a useful simple ansatz for the starting point of the iterative self - consistency procedure : @xmath51 , where the bond phase @xmath52 is given in the appendix [ appendix_tightphases ] and the @xmath14-wave nature of the bond field @xmath39 enters through factors @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) if @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "one then proceeds to diagonalize @xmath35 from ( [ tb_ham_start ] ) , recomputes @xmath39 using the self - consistency condition ( [ tb_selfconsistency ] ) , and repeats the procedure until the convergence is achieved . in practice ,",
    "the starting ansatz is a very good approximation to the final solution in a sense that both have the same phase defects , the same symmetries , and the ratio of the fully self - consistent solution @xmath39 to the ansatz @xmath57 is merely a periodic smooth function close to unity at all bonds of the lattice , except possibly in a close proximity of vortices .",
    "consequently , we first concentrate on the ( non - selfconsistent ) bdg hamiltonian ( [ tb_ham_start ] ) with @xmath51 , which allows for an easier systematization of the results due to the reduced number of parameters and note that all possible microscopic hamiltonians leading to @xmath14-wave pairing are now encoded by a single bond variable @xmath50 . at the same time",
    ", this approach permits one to avoid a time - consuming search for the solution of the fully self - consistent problem . in the end",
    ", we will briefly discuss the effects of varying @xmath39 near vortices .",
    "@xmath58    where the summation indices @xmath59 denote the nearest neighbors of @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the pauli matrix . although we will be interested in a periodic inversion - symmetric lattice of vortices , hamiltonian @xmath35 does not explicitly possess the symmetries of the physical vortex lattice . in general",
    ", one has to accompany the translations by a vortex lattice vector with an additional gauge transformation restoring the hamiltonian to its original form . rather than working with representations of the resulting magnetic translations group",
    ", we perform a unitary transformation of a special form @xmath62 such that the transformed hamiltonian @xmath63 is explicitly periodic .",
    "it is easy to see that , regardless of the transformation used to bring the hamiltonian @xmath35 to a periodic form , the minimal unit cell must contain at least two vortices : after the transformation the diagonal hopping term contains modified peierls factors @xmath64 .",
    "suppose these factors are periodic , then consider a product @xmath65 over the oriented bonds along a closed path formed by the perimeter of the unit cell traversed counterclockwise . since @xmath66 and factors @xmath67 are to be periodic , such a product should be equal to @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath69 thus the flux of magnetic field through the unit cell must be an integer of @xmath70 , and therefore must contain at least two @xmath71 superconducting vortices .     left : magnetic unit cell containing two vortices labelled as @xmath72 and @xmath73 with magnetic length @xmath74 .",
    "right : the symmetry of dispersion @xmath75 within the brillouin zone ( bz ) , which follow from the symmetry operations of the hamiltonian @xmath76 , is shown .",
    "16 equivalent points are displayed as solid dots ; and it is sufficient to study only @xmath77-th portion of the bz drawn as a dashed triangle . ]    an explicit form of such a transformation can be realized by considering a simple family of the so - called symmetric transformations@xcite : @xmath78 with suitably chosen @xmath79 . in the continuum version of the theory",
    "this transformation forces branch - cuts and non - locality on the eigenfunctions of @xmath80 .",
    "although the tight - binding lattice version of it does not cause undue complications @xcite , here we utilize another common choice , the ft transformation@xcite , whose continuum analogue does not require branch - cuts : @xmath81 where site variables @xmath82 and @xmath83 are explicitly given in the appendix a of ref . .",
    "after defining periodic@xcite bond variables @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 according to @xmath87 the resulting periodic hamiltonian is given by @xmath88 with @xmath59 denoting the nearest neighbors of @xmath60 .      one can now attempt to describe the low energy portion of the quasiparticle spectrum using the linearized approximation , leading to simon - lee scaling for various properties .",
    "the derivation of the linearized version of @xmath35 has been performed in refs . by gradient expansion resulting in a continuum hamiltonian with dispersion , which is then linearized as usual @xcite .",
    "one might expect that the coefficients of the final model obtained in this way reproduce the spectrum of the full tb model for the values of chemical potential @xmath28 not too close to the half - filling  where the dispersion is not quadratic  and also for @xmath28 not too close to the bottom of the tight - binding band , otherwise the linearization procedure itself is not justified .",
    "below , we describe an alternative derivation which , while proceeding along similar lines as the standard procedure , does lift the first restriction and allows one to consider values of @xmath28 at and near half - filling . at the end of this section , we will revisit this derivation and show that it should be corrected to accommodate the curvature and the so - called `` interference '' effects .",
    "the linearization procedure is based on the assumption that wavefunctions can be represented as @xmath89 where @xmath90 labels the dirac - like nodes of a @xmath14-wave gap function located in momentum space at @xmath91 , and @xmath92 is slowly varying function on the scale of @xmath93 .",
    "variable @xmath3 introduced here for brevity of notation simply equals @xmath94 , where @xmath18 is the magnitude of the fermi momentum in a nodal direction . after substituting this form into the bdg eigenvalue problem for hamiltonian @xmath76 ( [ tb_ham_ft ] ) ,",
    "a typical term has the form of a sum over @xmath95 : @xmath96 where fourier transform of @xmath97 is assumed to be composed of wavevectors close to the four nodal momenta at the fermi surface and @xmath98 .",
    "note that the straightforward gradient expansion is valid only qualitatively since @xmath99 is not necessarily much smaller than one .",
    "the linearization , however , can be performed directly , without the preliminary `` continuization '' step , by first separating the rapidly oscillating part : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a function that changes slowly on the scale of few lattice spacings . to obtain the effective linearized description ,",
    "we now replace the lattice function @xmath101 by a slowly changing function @xmath102 defined in continuum , such that it coincides with @xmath101 when @xmath60 correspond to the lattice sites .",
    "thus , @xmath102 can be thought of as an interpolating function for a discrete set @xmath101 .",
    "the detailed form of the interpolation turns out unimportant for the leading order results derived below , as long as the characteristic scale on which @xmath101 varies is much larger than the lattice spacing @xmath27 .",

    "since the only length in this effective low - energy hamiltonian ( [ h_tb_lin ] ) is the magnetic length @xmath4 , it immediately follows @xmath126 and , consequently , the spectrum of this hamiltonian must satisfy the simon - lee scaling relation for the low energy eigenstates : @xmath127      let us briefly summarize the properties of the spectrum in the absence of a magnetic field , which is obtained from ( [ tb_ham_ft ] ) by setting the field - induced factors @xmath128 and @xmath129 to zero .",

    "let us first recall the results for a fully particle - hole symmetric system @xcite , corresponding to @xmath22 .",

    "this is quite unusual non - perturbative result , since it suggests that for arbitrarily small fields giving rise to a vortex lattice , the number of zero modes is doubled compared to the four nodes of the zero - field problem , provided the magnetic length has the correct commensuration with the tight - binding lattice spacing .    in the opposite case @xmath145",

    "this conclusion in turn would have required that in the expansion of the overall field - induced gap @xmath149 the leading @xmath150 term is absent , and only small gaps of order @xmath21 should generally appear from the terms that were left out in the process of linearization .",
    "the large gaps whose size scales as @xmath150 for weak magnetic fields in a particle - hole symmetric situations at commensuration factors @xmath151 , as was found in refs .",

    "these large gaps were interpreted as as the effect of the inter - nodal interference , and such effects for the deliberately distorted lattice were indeed found to be suppressed . it was argued that in realistic situations a weak disorder in vortex positions or the one due to impurities will suppresses these interference effects . yet , the following questions remain to be answered : first , is this situation specific only to a particle - hole symmetric system ( @xmath22 ) ?",
    "second , how could the scaling relation ( [ simonleescaling ] ) be explicitly violated , even for an ideal periodic lattice ?",

    "the parameters used in this figure are @xmath374 , @xmath375 , @xmath376 ; the main structure of the graph is robust under the change of parameters of the model : in particular , at all cites near the vortex , except the four nearest neighbors , the tldos has additional peaks at energy @xmath377 . ]",
    "we analyzed the properties of the mixed state in the tight - binding lattice @xmath14-wave superconductors by considering a quasiparticle spectrum of i ) a vortex lattice and , separately , of ii ) an isolated superconducting grain accommodating precisely a single vortex .",
    "to reduce the set of free parameters to a manageable number , we restricted ourselves to the simplest tight - binding model , described by only two parameters associated with the normal state @xmath378 , and additionally assume that the magnitude of the gap function @xmath50 is spatially uniform . within a set of simple mean - field microscopic theories , such as those arising from an extended hubbard or a @xmath379 model , this assumption",
    "is well justified since for the parameters suited for to the cuprates , with their short coherence lengths , the self - consistent calculations show that the amplitude of the order parameter recovers its bulk value at distances of only a few lattice spacings .",
    "we find that the low - energy properties of the spectrum are described by simon - lee scaling only on _ average _ , and that both the energy dispersion and the ( local ) density of states experience oscillations as a function of the chemical potential and a magnetic field .",
    "the magnitude of the oscillations in the energy levels behaves as @xmath5 as a function of magnetic length , and therefore it is of the same order as the average simon - lee part of the dependence of @xmath75 on @xmath4 .",
    "we find that in all cases , these oscillations can be well described by a modified simon - lee scaling ( [ modsimonlee ] ) , which includes _ additional _",
    "@xmath8-periodic dependence of the energy levels on @xmath304 .",
    "this modification is shown to be a consequence of the diverging solutions of the `` linearized '' hamiltonian .",
    "a careful treatment of these divergencies is needed@xcite , lest one underestimates the quantitative importance of the inter - nodal and formally subleading intra - nodal matrix elements of the hamiltonian . as a result ,",
    "the actual expansion parameters of the theory include @xmath247 , rather than only @xmath380 , and the scaling of the quasiparticle energy spectrum with respect to magnetic length @xmath4 is consequently modified .",
    "in addition , we analyzed the large - energy , short - distance features of the quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "we found that ",
    "apart from the four sites surrounding a vortex where the thermally broadened tldos exhibits zero bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) , in agreement with refs .  the tldos on all other sites in the vicinity of a vortex instead show peaks at sub - gap energies .",
    "the energy of these sub - gap peaks does not depend on magnetic field , and is determined only by the parameters of the band structure and @xmath50 .",
    "finally , we examined how the tldos is modified when the amplitude of the @xmath14-wave gap function is varied locally in the vicinity of the vortex core and found that the suppression of the zero - bias peak corresponds to the enhancement of the @xmath14-wave gap function , which could arise through the locally enhanced@xcite effective pairing interaction constant @xmath381 .",
    "such enhancement might result from the effect of the impurity atoms pinning the vortices or from a local distortion of atomic lattice by a vortex or fluctuations of @xmath14-wave order parameter .",

    "as mentioned in the main text , in principle the bond phase of the order parameter @xmath52 should be determined self - consistently .",
    "it is convenient , however , to adopt a synthetic approach and approximate @xmath52 by using the known solution @xmath382 of the _ continuum _ ginzburg - landau vortex - lattice problem , whose explicit form is given for example in appendix a of ref . .",
    "one may set @xmath383 $ ] or @xmath384 .",
    "the latter , which will be predominantly used by us in this article , requires explanation since @xmath385 must be defined modulo @xmath8 , while in the form above @xmath52 is defined only modulo @xmath124 .",
    "more accurate definition reads @xmath386 where the integral is over the bond connecting @xmath60 and @xmath59 .",
    "it is easy to show that this definition is consistent in the sense that @xmath387 , and provided that @xmath382 does not change by more than @xmath124 along a bond , the phase @xmath52 defined in this way is indeed the `` average '' of @xmath382 and @xmath388 in the sense that the `` average '' is understood as the closest to either @xmath382 ( or equivalently @xmath388 ) of the two possible choices .",
    "note that unlike @xmath52 , phases @xmath389 and @xmath390 are not determined by any self - consistent procedure , and merely serve as a technical device to recast the hamiltonian in a periodic form ; we are therefore free to assign their values according to our convenience . without lost of generality ,",
    "we choose them by simply evaluating continuous functions @xmath391 and @xmath392 from the previous section on sites of the tight - binding lattice .",
    "given definition ( [ definetheta ] ) , coefficients @xmath393 , @xmath394 , and @xmath395 can be easily found from ( [ definebondvars ] ) and explicit expressions for @xmath396 from appendix a of ref .",
    ": @xmath397 since @xmath398 and @xmath399 are periodic@xcite , clearly so are @xmath400 and @xmath395 .    the phase factors possess a number of discrete symmetries , which result in the symmetry of the dispersion shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ unitcell ] .",
    "the full set of the symmetry operations consists of operations @xmath381 shown in [ sympsi ] and eight additional transformations @xmath401 , where @xmath402 is an inversion operator around a midpoint between two ( arbitrary ) vortices @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "each transformation involves a point group operation @xmath403 shown in fig .",
    "[ sympsi ] , which may be followed by complex conjugation and multiplication by pauli matrix @xmath61 .",
    "thus , overall there are @xmath404 distinct points in the brillouin zone with identical set of energy eigenvalues .",
    "additionally , if @xmath405 is an eigenstate of energy @xmath278 , then @xmath406 is an eigenstate of energy @xmath407 and the same momentum @xmath142 .",
