    "a fundamental goal of qcd is to provide an accurate description of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) which contain the nonperturbative strong dynamics .",
    "while integrated pdfs can be defined in a gauge - invariant way that is compatible with factorization , ensuring multiplicative renormalizability and dglap evolution , the definition of unintegrated or , equivalently , transverse - momentum dependent ( tmd ) , parton distributions , poses severe problems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : ( a ) additional , so - called rapidity , divergences @xcite appear , related to lightlike wilson lines ( or the use of the light - cone gauge @xmath0 ) @xcite , that can not be taken care of by ordinary ultraviolet ( uv ) renormalization alone . in the integrated case",
    "these divergences also appear but they mutually cancel @xcite , allowing a probabilistic interpretation .",
    "( b ) moreover , in the light - cone gauge , the result depends on the applied pole prescription in the gluon propagator . only with the advanced boundary condition , which sets the transverse gauge link to unity , one recovers the results obtained in the feynman gauge @xcite .",
    "( c ) the reduction to the integrated case is at least not straightforward @xcite .",
    "( d ) universality is in general broken @xcite , an issue outside the scope of our analysis , given that we concentrate on unpolarized pdfs only .",
    "this point will be briefly addressed in the last section .",
    "let us discuss these issues in more detail .    the first issue ,",
    "i.e. , the treatment of the rapidity divergences , is on the focus of our investigation and will be discussed in detail below .",
    "the second question has been addressed by belitsky , ji , and yuan ( bjy ) @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) , where a transverse gauge link was introduced in order to exhaust the gauge freedom of the tmd pdf .",
    "the third problem becomes trivial in our approach because it is avoided ab initio by the proposed definition of the tmd pdf .",
    "in particular , one may note the    * collins - soper ( cs ) approach @xcite ( or cutoff method ) ( see also @xcite ) . + these authors were the first to address issue ( a ) and to propose a solution of the problem by adopting either a non - lightlike axial gauge or by shifting the integration contour slightly off the light cone .",
    "this , however , entails the introduction of an additional rapidity parameter @xmath1 ( with @xmath2 ) to encode the deviation from the light cone .",
    "to establish independence from this arbitrary variable , an additional evolution equation to the standard one has to be fulfilled causing the reduction to the integrated case questionable .",
    "besides , factorization off the light cone also becomes problematic .",
    "* collins - hautmann approach @xcite ( or subtractive method ) .",
    "+ these authors suggest another way to circumvent problem ( a ) : they restrict themselves to lightlike wilson lines and remove the rapidity divergences by redefining the tmd pdf .",
    "the principal element in their approach is the introduction of a soft counter term that compensates these divergences , shown explicitly at the one - loop order and working in the feynman gauge ; a fresh look was given by collins and metz @xcite .",
    "more recently , hautmann @xcite claimed that the reduction to the integrated case can also be performed within this method .",
    "in our work we will follow another strategy , based on the renormalization properties of tmd pdfs in terms of their anomalous dimensions .",
    "the reason is that anomalous dimensions ( within perturbative qcd ) encode the key characteristics of wilson lines in _ local _ form .",
    "in contrast , gauge contours are _ global _ objects and , hence , difficult to handle within a local - field theory framework .",
    "a properly defined tmd pdf should respect collinear factorization .",
    "but this turns out to be in conflict with the gauge link because the wilson line contains not only longitudinal gluons that could be eliminated by imposing the light - cone gauge , it also comprises transverse ones , with a distinct region of @xmath3 , that are accumulated after the quark has been struck by the hard current and changes its direction from @xmath4 to @xmath5 . as a result",
    ", one can not define a tmd pdf by introducing a straight lightlike line between the quarks ( i.e. , a `` connector '' @xcite ) .",
    "the reason is that the two quark fields have a separation also in the transverse coordinate space and hence the gluons originating from this are not collinear to the struck quark ( they mismatch in the gluon rapidity ) .",
    "the common assumption to avoid this problem is to use a combined contour which joins the quarks through light - cone infinity .",
    "our analysis shows that such a contour can not be a smooth one , as usually tacitly assumed , but it has to contain some obstruction in the transverse direction ( not specified yet ) which will inevitably contribute to the total anomalous dimension of the tmd pdf .",
    "therefore , in order to be able to reproduce the well - known result in the feynman gauge , one has to define the tmd pdf in such a way as to cancel this unwanted anomalous - dimension term . to this end , we seek to recast the wilson line in terms of the associated anomalous dimensions .",
    "we will show that this can be naturally achieved within a formalism which inherently respects gauge invariance by using manifestly gauge - invariant quark fields that account for the whole gauge `` history '' in the sense of mandelstam @xcite .",
    "details will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we first provide arguments for the necessity to insert a transverse gauge link .",
    "then we continue with the the calculation of the anomalous dimension of the tmd pdf and show that there is a contribution at light - cone infinity in the transverse direction that can be associated with a cusp . in the same section",
    "we will supply a modified definition of the tmd pdf that provides the same anomalous dimension as the one in the feynman gauge .",

    "+ iii ) we outlined how this new contribution can be included in the definition of the tmd pdf by means of a soft counter term , as proposed by collins @xcite .",
    "we found that this new term can be written as an `` intrinsic coulomb phase '' that keeps track of the full gauge history of the colored quarks @xcite .",
    "this phase may be given the following interpretation : before the quark is being struck it is escorted only by longitudinal gluons that can be formally eliminated by imposing the light - cone gauge .",
    "however , when it leaves the ( hard ) interaction region , it is not lying on the minus light - cone direction and exchanges soft transverse gluons with the quark spectator .",
    "hence , one can not trivialize the interaction of the struck quark with the gauge field by imposing a single gauge choice on a lightlike ray , because the struck quark enters and leaves the hard - interaction vertex with different four - velocities , as it becomes evident from eq .",
    "( [ eq : current ] ) .",
    "this complies with the interpretation given by belitsky , ji , and yuan @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in terms of final - state interactions of the struck quark with the gluon field of the target spectators .",
    "as long as one disregards polarization effects , the direction of the wilson line ( expressed by means of the @xmath74 prescription in the gluon propagator ) , appears only in intermediate steps of the calculation and cancels at the end because it is only a phase . in conclusion",
