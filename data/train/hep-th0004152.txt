    "rephrasing i.kant we can say that any physical theory should start from the first principles and assumptions based on intuition directly related to the existing physical phenomena , then proceed to the concepts , complete theory with a central idea , and crown it with the experimental verification and testable predictions .",
    "one of the best examples of this path is provided by the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics .",
    "their further development spurred by the need to unite gravity and quantum mechanics resulted in the birth of the string theory .    during 30 years of its development the string theory demonstrated remarkable achievements in all but one respect : there is no direct way to verify its theoretical results .",
    "in addition , there is at least one `` thorny '' question : why does the world we are living in appears to be @xmath6-dimensional ?",
    "up to now string theory could not produced a satisfactory answer .",
    "it seems that string theory ignored possible alternative basic assumptions which , as we will see later , could have produced a plausible answer : multi - fractality of spacetime , a possibility of spacetime dimensions ranging from negative dimensions to infinite ones , as in the @xmath7 cantorian theory of el naschie @xcite and the resolution - dependent character of physical laws as described for example by nottale s scale relativity @xcite .",
    "one of the basic problem facing future developments of a successful physical theory is a description of the quantum `` reality '' without introducing by hand _ a priori _ existing background .",
    "interestingly enough , as one of the first steps in formulating the theoretical foundations of physics newton disposed of this problem rather easily by simply introducing ( almost at the very beginning of `` principia '' ) the absolute space and time as entities `` which do not bear any relation to anything external '' .",
    "it is clear that without an attendant background ( either not changing or changing rather slowly as compared to developing phenomena ) any description of a physical theory looks impossible .    to formalize dynamics of physical phenomena we have to answer the following question : the dynamics with respect to what ?",
    "for example , the lagrangian of the string theory refers to the background of proper time ( which is rather a vague notion since we have to have a physical device attached to a string and measuring time intervals which in turn are not defined precisely ) and coordinates along the string .",
    "the very spacetime exists only to `` the extent that it can be reconstructed from the 2-d field theory''@xcite .",
    "n other words , there is no `` background spacetime '' @xmath8 .",
    "quantum spacetime is truly a `` process in the making '' @xcite which implies that gravity should be described by a * nonlinear * theory .",
    "we are dealing with a nonlinear complex dynamical system that is able of self - tuning in a fashion similar to biological systems in nature @xcite . to put it succinctly",
    ", we can say that the universe could be viewed as the `` organism '' , or using a more fashionable wording , the ultimate quantum machian computer . here",
    "we refer to the mach principle : a physical theory should contain only the _ relations _ between physical quantities .",
    "it is the relations ( reflected in algebraic operations ) among their representative elements ( monads ) that govern a system s evolution @xcite .",
    "therefore algebraic - categorical relations are the only meaningful relations which are applicable for a description of such an `` organism '' @xcite- @xcite .",
    "he problem of spacetime generation could be addressed with the help of what we call a new relativity @xcite-@xcite,@xcite , a theory which is based on a few postulates .",
    "one of these postulates is an old bootstrap idea by chew : a physical system in a process of its development simultaneously generates its own background .",
    "in particular , geometry ( initially nonexistent ) is produced by a recursive ( self - referential ) process starting from a `` hyperpoint '' @xcite endowed with infinite dimensions , or equivalently with an infinite amount of information @xcite,@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the latter implies a possibility of emergence of an ensemble of interacting universes having all possible dimensions ranging from negative values to infinity .",
    "the ensemble average yields the 3-dimensional world of our perception .",
    "thus an assumption about existence of such an ensemble ( emerging as a result of a bootstrapping process ) of the universes with all possible dimensions points in the direction where even string theory with its 10 , 11 , 26 dimensions does not go .",
    "implications of infinite dimensions which in the final run can be viewed as `` words '' constructed out of infinite information contained in a `` hyperpoint '' provides us with a source of a bootstrapping mechanism of spacetime generation .",
    "equally , the energy also emerges as a result of self - organization of the initial infinite amount of information ( number of bits ) .",
    "the inter - connectivity of energy , dimensions , information becomes especially visible if we consider the information contained in all possible @xmath9-loop histories .",
    "if we recall that @xmath10-loop corresponds to a point ( 0-d),@xmath11-loop corresponds to a line ( @xmath11-d ) , etc .",
    "then a total number of all the @xmath9-loop histories in @xmath12-dimensions is @xmath13 .",
    "as a result the respective shannon information @xmath14 is equivalent to the number of dimensions @xmath12 ( up to a non - essential constant factor ) .",
    "information in turn creates energy and is created by energy .",
    "this leads to a `` triad '' of equivalence generated by a recursive loop : dimensions @xmath15 information @xmath15 energy .",
    "the recursive loop could be viewed as some kind of a spiral of eternal creation and annihilation of energy , dimensions and by implication geometry .",
    "another basic postulate of a new relativity is nottale s scale relativity @xcite takes the planck scale @xmath16 m as the ultimate ( and absolute ) scale .",
    "this postulate allows one to unify the spaces of different dimensions similar to the unification of time and space in einstein s relativity ( on the basis of the absolute character of the speed of light ) .",
    "subsequently , a new relativity theory does not need to deal with compactification and decompactification of superstring theory .",
    "the latter pose a serious problem since it leads to a huge number of possible phenomenological theories of the world .",
    "a new relativity theory adopting the infinite - dimensional universe and the ultimate scale @xmath17 attainable in nature suggests that topological field theories are the most natural candidates for a `` theory of the world '' .",
    "indirectly this is confirmed by the assumption that below planck scale there is no such thing as a distance ( interval ) meaning that the topology becomes a decisive factor there .",
    "the third postulate of a new relativity is an extension of the ordinary spacetime to noncommutative c - spaces thus making a quantum mechanical loop equations fully covariant .",
    "this is done by extending the concepts of ordinary spacetime vectors and tensors to non - commutative clifford manifolds where all p - branes are unified with the help of clifford multivectors .",
    "there exists a one - to - one correspondence between a nested hierarchy of 0-loop,1-loop , ... , p - loop histories in @xmath12 dimensions coded in terms of hypermatrices and single lines in clifford manifolds .",
    "this is roughly equivalent to penrose twistor program .",
    "the respective non - commutative geometry is taken to be the transfinite continuum of cantorian fractal spacetime studied extensively by m.el naschie @xcite and g.ord @xcite .",
    "recently a new relativity theory claimed a few successes .",
    "one of those is especially interesting .",
    "a few years ago @xcite the leading figure in string theory e.witten remarked , probably with some disappointment , that `` a proper theoretical framework for the extra term in the uncertainty '' ( stringy ) `` relation has not emerged '' .",
    "it has turned that a full - blown stringy uncertainty relation ( and its truncated version ) could be straightforwardly derived within the framework of a new relativity with the help of its basic postulates @xcite .",
    "also , in appendix a we provide an elementary heuristic derivation of the stringy uncertainty relation based only on the postulate of the minimum attainable scale ( @xmath18 ) in nature .",
    "in addition , it was shown @xcite that a new relativity disposes of both epr and black hole information loss paradoxes .",
    "more recently , it allowed one of us @xcite to derive in an elementary fashion the black hole area - entropy relation valid for any number of dimensions . in appendix",
    "b we briefly review this derivation and demonstrate that bekenstein - hawking relation is a particular case of a more general relation .",
    "furthermore , we argue why the holographic principle is a direct result of a new relativity .",
    "a new relativity s most surprising prediction of group velocity exceeding speed of light ( without resorting to tachyons ) found its verification in recent experiments by ranfagni and collaborators @xcite who discovered the evidence for `` faster than light '' wave propagation to distances up to one meter .    in section",
    "* 2 * we consider an ensemble of dimensions ( including infinity ) of quantum spacetime and derive its distribution function .",
    "the subsequent calculation of the respective average dimension associated with this distribution is given in section * 3 * where we obtain the value for this average which is very close to @xmath0 + @xmath5 ( @xmath19 is the golden mean ) previously obtained on the basis of a cantorian fractal spacetime model .",
    "a perceived 4-dimensional world then follows as a result of a coarse - grained long range averaging effect of the underlying cantorian fractal geometry , as discussed by el naschie @xcite .",
    "in addition we present a brief discussion of a plausible chiral symmetry breaking mechanism in nature .    in section * 4",
    "* we show why the `` cosmological constant problem '' is never an issue within the framework of a new relativity .",
    "this follows from the idea of the automatic self - organization and self - tuning of the universe in accordance with the renormalization group flow with respect to a local scaling microscopic arrow of time @xcite ( see appendix c ) .",
    "we also propose a cosmological scenario as an alternative to the big bang , inflationary , brane - worlds and variable speed of light cosmologies . according to our model ,",
    "the world began as a result of a non - equilibrium process of self - organized critical phenomena launched by vacuum fluctuations in cantorian fractal spacetime .",
    "its future evolution proceeded in such a way that that determined our existence in a metastable vacuum with a a subsequent transition to the renormalization group fixed point of a dimension @xmath20 = @xmath0 + @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the above `` fixed critical point '' is not a true fixed point but rather a metastable one , which means that it does not represent a true vacuum . in section * 5 * we discuss how a new phase transition will eventually drive the universe to another ( quasi - crystal ) phase of a lower average dimension of @xmath21 representing the true vacuum .",
    "using one of the basic postulate of a new relativity ( nottale s scale relativity ) we arrive at two integral expressions which determine the upper limits imposed on a ) the hubble radius and b ) the size of the quasi - crystal phase .",
    "these expressions show that both limits depend on the value @xmath2 of the golden mean which is a recurrent feature of our analysis .",
    "finally , in the concluding section * 6 * we summarize our results and write down , for finite values of @xmath12 , the unique quantum master action functional for the world in * c*-space , ( outside spacetime ) .",
    "this action functional governs the full quantum dynamics for the creation of spacetime , gravity , and all the fundamental forces in nature .",
    "it appears that the quantum symmetry in such a world should be represented by a braided hopf quantum clifford algebra .",
    "the quantum field theory which follows from such an action is currently under investigation @xcite .",
    "to proceed with calculation of an average dimension of the observable world we make an assumption that there exists a certain ensemble of universes with dimensions ranging from some zero ( reference ) point ( to be determined ) to infinity .",
    "the above reference point is analogous for example to a zero point energy of a quantum oscillator . to simplify our analysis we choose a spherical symmetry and represent the introduced ensemble as a set of hyper - spheres whose radii are integer multiples of the fundamental quantum of length , the planck scale @xmath17 .",
    "if we would have chosen , say hyper - cubes instead of hyper - spheres then it would have changed the respective geometry of the ensemble but not its topology .",
    "however the latter is more fundamental than the former and therefore justifies a choice of the spheres as the basic constituents of the ensemble .    in what follows we pattern our derivation after planck s approach to the black body radiation .",
    "the ensemble of the universes is in contact with an information bath prepared by some `` universal observer '' existing ( we use the word @xmath22 at the wo nt of a more appropriate word ) @xmath23 of the ensemble .",
    "such a frame of reference associated with the `` universal observer '' can be associated with a hyperpoint of infinite dimensions having an infinite amount of information ( see appendix c ) which could undergo a self - ordering ( bootstrapping ) when perturbed ( even slightly ) .",
    "the members of the ensemble ( hyper - spheres , or p - branes ) can exchange energy ( and information ) with the `` walls '' of this bath at the planck temperature @xmath24 ( in units c=@xmath25=k = 1 ) which is proportional to the number of hyper - spheres , that is to the information content of the bath .",
    "we assume ( in the spirit of things quantum ) that the energy exchange occurs in integer `` chunks '' .",
    "equivalently , the hyper - spheres can absorb quanta ( from the bath ) emit quanta ( to the bath ) , and exchange quanta between themselves .",
    "these quanta represent background independent geometric bits ( see appendix b ) or the true quanta of spacetime and thus replace gravitons of the linearized gravity which are not background independent . the geometric bits form their own background where they continue to evolve further .",
    "this is in agreement with one of the postulates of a new relativity ( described earlier ) , namely the chew bootstrap idea .",
    "when the latter is applied to p - branes ( our hyper - spheres ) it states that all the p - branes are made of each other .",
    "ince geometric bits are quanta of fundamental excitations of spacetime we do not need to have @xmath26 an embedding target spacetime background where excitations of @xmath9-branes are to propagate .",
    "the above ensemble is self - supporting ( self - referential),i.e .",
    "it obeys the bootstrap conditions .",
    "this results in a background independent formulation of the emergence of spacetime in a sense that the target background spacetime is not fixed @xmath26 .",
    "the ensemble itself creates ( self - reproduces ) its own background in a process of the evolution .",
    "quite recently smolin and kauffman pointed that self - organized critical phenomena @xcite might play a role in the description of quantum gravity .",
    "in particular such processes would have allowed the emerging universe to self - tune its fundamental constants , e.g. , the cosmological constant .",
    "interestingly enough , there exists a connection between our ensemble of universes and p - adic topology . in p - adic topology",
    "all sets are simultaneously open and closed ( @xmath27 ) , and every point of the set is its center .",
    "this means that there is no preferred point which could be considered as a reference point ; the only meaningful statements which can be made is about relations between different points .",
    "if the introduced ensemble of universes is also simultaneously opened and closed then there is no preferred hyper - spheres in the ensemble : the only thing that counts is their relations which nicely fits into mach s principle .",
    "since there is no preferred `` point '' in the ensemble we are left with only one choice for the reference frame , namely the thermal bath prepared by the `` universal observer '' ( see above ) . within this frame of reference",
    "we can define the ground ( reference ) energy , an analog of the zero point energy of a quantum oscillator . to this end",
    "we assume that all the hyper - spheres in the ensemble have the same radius equal to the planck length , @xmath28 , that is the minimum attainable length in nature .",
    "the respective planck energy @xmath29 could be taken as the reference energy .",
    "the latter statement raises the following question .",
    "do all the hyper - spheres of the planck radius but of different dimensionality have the same value of reference energy ? if we assume that the respective energies are different we arrive at a contradiction , since we have chosen the reference point to be the same for any dimension",
    ". a choice of different values of the reference energy ( according to the dimensionality ) would violate the poly - dimensional covariance ( one of the postulates of a new relativity ) stating that all the dimensions must be treated on the same footing ( there is no preferred dimension)@xcite .",
    "hence all the unit hyper - spheres in any dimension have the same reference ( vacuum ) energy @xmath30 .",
    "we postulate the invariance of the bulk energy density for hyper - spheres of arbitrary radii @xmath31 in any dimension @xmath12 , that is @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 is a radial excitation energy of a hyper - sphere of a radius @xmath35 .",
    "the above postulate is based upon `` incompressiblity '' ( or volume - preserving diffeomorphism symmetry ) that appeared within the context of @xmath9-branes on many occasions .",
    "the hyper - spheres are quantized in integers of planck units .",
    "an increase in size of a @xmath12-dim hyper - sphere in a process of absorption of energy `` bits '' occurs in such a way as to maintain the energy density equal to the vacuum energy density , @xmath36    from eq.(2.1 ) follows that the energy @xmath37 is :    @xmath38    thus we arrive at the following picture : the ground state of the initial ensemble comprises a condensate of hyper - spheres ( at planck temperature @xmath39 ) of all possible dimensions , where each hyper - sphere has a unit radius ( in planck units ) and a constant energy @xmath40 . a pioneering concept of a vacuum state of quantum gravity as a condensate was originally introduced by g.chapline @xcite .",
    "a condensation at high temperatures was studied by rojas _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the condensation occurs in such a fashion that the hyper - spheres in the ensemble tends to distribute themselves so as to minimize the energy densities .",
    "for example , the spheres in the dimension range @xmath41 ( corresponding to the maximum volume of a unit sphere ) will have a higher statistical weight than those in the extreme values @xmath42 of the dimensions corresponding to a zero volume of a unit hypersphere .    using the principle of a minimum energy density",
    "we introduce the gamma distribution as the distribution function for the ensemble of hyper - spheres ( with the planck radius normalized to one ) :    @xmath43 here the values of @xmath44 are the statistical weights of the distribution . to account for thermal effects due to a decrease of the average temperature , from the planck temperature to about 3 kelvins",
    "we include into distribution ( 2.3 ) the energy dependence by using the bose - einstein distribution based on the hyper - sphere energy @xmath37 and its temperature @xmath45 .",
    "therefore the distribution density @xmath46 will take the following form @xmath47 = c_d/[e^{\\frac{{\\cal e }   ( r/\\lambda)^d } { kt}}-1]\\eqno(2.4)\\ ] ] where we use eq.(2.2 ) .",
    "at the beginning of this section we postulated that the introduced ensemble contains hyper - spheres of infinite dimensions .",
    "now we prove this statement ( at least for integer dimensions ) with the help of the fermat s last theorem .",
    "upon collision two hyper - spheres , @xmath48 and @xmath49 can produce a third hyper - sphere @xmath50 analogous either to a final product of a chemical reaction or to a * 3 * -point vertex in string field theory . let us assume for the moment that all the hyper - spheres have the same dimension @xmath12 .",
    "the above interaction then conserves energy .",
    "taking into account additivity of the energy we get    @xmath51 where , after a cancellation of a common factor @xmath52 we get the energies expressed as integers ( quanta ) @xmath53 .",
    "according to the fermat s last theorem , eq.(2.5 ) has no solution in nonnegative integers for integer dimensions greater than @xmath54 .",
    "since we live in the universe of the average dimension @xmath55 the fermat last theorem requires an energy balance different from ( 2.5 ) : @xmath56 where the dimensionalities @xmath57 can not be all equal .",
    "hence we have arrived at one of the most important results of our work . according to the fermat",
    "last theorem the equilibrium ( or quasi - equilibrium ) state of a thermalization process can be attained only if the dimensions of the colliding hyper - spheres must change in the process .",
    "since dimension is a topological invariant , such a collision represents a simple example of a topology changing process while geometry is restricted to spherical geometry . thus reducing the problem to the previous case .",
    "we also would like to point out that a phase transition might not only change topologies but also transform one geometry into another . ]",
    "let us consider an example of a simple dimension - changing process : @xmath58 , that is @xmath59 here 2 quanta ( geometric bits ) plus 25 quanta ( geometric bits ) yield 27 quanta ( geometric bits ) . since energy has been conserved in this process so does the information .",
    "the inverse process is also possible .",
    "state @xmath50 can decay into a sum @xmath60 .",
    "this would look like some dimensional `` compactification '' process .",
    "a @xmath61 sphere of radius @xmath62 in planck units has `` compactified '' into a sphere of @xmath63 , of radius @xmath54 in planck units , and another sphere of @xmath64 , of radius @xmath65 in planck units . using the analogous arguments we can consider more complicated collisions , like @xmath66 .",
    "since the dimensions fluctuations are not necessarily small one has to abandon a perturbative expansion used in string theory .",
    "for example , the perturbative string theory could not even reproduce a dimension change from @xmath67 to @xmath68 , let alone handle infinity of dimensions . on the other hand , by using all the dimensions ( including infinite ones ) on equal footing and employing the fermat last theorem we bypass the need to use perturbative methods and an unpleasant task of summation over all the topologies .",
    "the thermalization process of collisions ( described by the fermat theorem ) automatically performs summation over different topologies .",
    "thus , for example , @xmath69 does not have the same topology as @xmath70 simply because the respective dimensions are different , the fact taken into account by eq.(2.6 ) .",
    "using the distribution density @xmath46 for the ensemble of hyper - spheres we get the average dimension of the ensemble as follows : @xmath71 the lower limit of integration @xmath72 must be found on the physical grounds . in a new relativity dimensions ( as everything else ) are defined in relation to a reference point . from the dependence of either a volume or",
    "an area on dimensions follows that for any finite radius both the volume and the area tend to 0 at @xmath73 .",
    "we take this value as the reference point .",
    "another limiting value of @xmath12 resulting in zero volume and area is @xmath74 .",
    "these considerations determine the limits of integration in ( 3.1 ) .",
    "since a hyper- sphere energy is given by ( 2.2 ) we immediately obtain @xmath75 where @xmath17 ( in units of @xmath76 ) can be represented in terms of newton s gravitational constant @xmath77 in @xmath78 dimensions .",
    "@xmath79 in @xmath80 the planck scale is the familiar @xmath81 .",
    "when @xmath64 the einstein - hilbert action is a topological invariant and ( 3.2 ) results in singularity .",
    "we can avoid this by choosing @xmath82 .",
    "this means that we can also choose the value of the universal scale to be @xmath11 in the units of @xmath83 .    upon substitution of ( 2.4 ) in ( 3.1 ) we get    @xmath84^{-1 }   \\int^{(r_h/\\lambda ) } _ 1   d(r/\\lambda )   ~   ( r/\\lambda)^{d-1}~ [ e^ { { { \\cal e}(r/\\lambda)^d\\over kt } } -1 ] ^{-1   }                 \\over \\int^\\infty _ d dd~d    { \\sqrt \\pi}^d [   \\gamma ( { d+2 \\over 2 } ) ] ^{-1 }    \\int^{(r_h/\\lambda ) } _ 1   d(r/\\lambda)~   ( r/\\lambda)^{d-1 } ~ [ e^ { { { \\cal e }   ( r/\\lambda)^d\\over kt } }   -1 ] ^ { -1 } } .",

    "therefore we will evaluate it numerically .",
    "still we can extract some information directly from ( 3.5 ) before resorting to numerical integration .",
    "in fact , we can distinguish @xmath62 easily identifiable regions in terms of the parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 :    \\(i ) @xmath91 .",
    "this means that the thermal factor @xmath92 and thus does not influence the resulting value of @xmath93 leaving it as if it were no thermal factor .",
    "( ii)@xmath94 . in this case",
    "the thermal factor @xmath95 once again tends to zero and will be factored out of the expression for @xmath93 .",
    "the latter remains the same as without the thermal factor , with the only difference that the final temperature @xmath45 will be much lower than the planck temperature @xmath39 corresponding to the vacuum energy @xmath30 .",
    "\\(iii ) @xmath96 , @xmath97 . in this case",
    "we can not factor out the thermal factor @xmath95 , and as a result it contributes significantly to the value of @xmath93 .",
    "numerical simulations show that in this case the fluctuations in @xmath98 and @xmath45 will initially lead to an increase of @xmath93 and then , after reaching a maximum value , to its monotonic decrease approaching asymptotically the metastable fixed point @xmath99 of the renormalization group .",
    "this point corresponds to our world which emerged from chaos ( a multitude of dimensions ) as soon as the ensemble of the hyper - spheres began evolving ( generating the respective average temperature and dimensions ) towards the metastable fixed point of the renormalization group    as a next step we will provide the numerical value of @xmath93 and demonstrate an importance ( and ubiquitousness ) of the golden mean @xmath2 in evaluations of the average dimensions of the world . in particular , it will help us to understand why we live in four dimensions , why their signature is @xmath6 , and why there might exist a deep reason of chiral symmetry breaking in nature .      we have already mentioned that a new relativity requires that dimensions should be calculated with respect to the reference point ( zero point dimension)@xmath101 , that is any dimension @xmath12 is in fact @xmath102 . in the previous section we have already chosen this reference point @xmath103 introducing @xmath104 into eq.(3.5 )",
    "we get    @xmath105    here @xmath106 is the average dimension without quantum dissipative effects ( responsible for the initial chaotic phase ) .",
    "the latter will increase the average dimension as compared to @xmath106 and prevent the expanding hyper - spheres from cooling down below the planck temperature @xmath39 .",
    "as soon as the average dimension reaches a peak value , the continuing expansion of the hyper - spheres will gain the `` upper hand '' over the re - heating due to quantum - dissipative effects . as a result the hyper - spheres will begin to cool , and",
    "the average dimension will begin to decrease towards its initial value .",
    "this will signal an onset of the `` ordered '' phase emerging from the initial chaotic phase ( quantum dissipation ) .",
    "it is possible to demonstrate that the average dimension can not fall below the metastable fixed point @xmath107 ( metastable vacuum ) of renormalization group until the system will reach the phase transition point and move towards the quasi - crystal phase ( the true vacuum ) .",
    "evaluating expression ( 3.5 ) for cases ( i ) and ( ii)we easily find that @xmath108    this value represents the upper value of @xmath93 . the respective lower value can be evaluated as follows .",
    "assuming that the dimensions are integers we replace in ( 3.5 ) the integrals by the sums and obtain @xmath109 which is smaller ( as expected ) than the value given by ( 3.8 ) , that is @xmath110    the values of @xmath93 based on a discrete ( 3.9 ) and integral(3.8 ) averages are in a very good agreement with el naschie results obtained with the help of the transfinite @xmath111cantorian fractal spacetime models in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "these models give the following exact value of the average dimension :    @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 is the dimension of the middle segment cantor set .",
    "the golden mean @xmath2 provides us with the basic `` unit '' , or the elementary dimension building block from which all the sets of the transfinite cantorian fractal spacetime models are constructed .",
    "these spaces are the densest spaces obtained from infinite intersections of infinite unions .",
    "the value of @xmath115 is the fractal dimension of a physical structure living in a @xmath10 topological dimension .",
    "this can be interpreted as packing , compressing ( information , for example ) the fractal dust points of dimensionality equal to @xmath2 into a `` point '' .",
    "we put quotation marks around `` point '' to emphasize that since there exists the minimum attainable ( non - zero ) scale in nature ( planck scale ) there are no points in nature .",
    "a geometrical point is in fact smeared out into a `` fuzzy '' ball / sets of all possible topological dimensions , from @xmath116 to @xmath117 .",
    "for this reason the naive concept of a fixed and well defined dimension can not be used anymore .",
    "the set of @xmath116 dimensions @xmath118 is called the void virtual set and the set of @xmath119 dimensions @xmath120 is called the universal set .",
    "the void set has in fact the fractal dimension @xmath10 , i.e the void set comprises one single fractal dust point .",
    "the universal set , on the contrary , has an uncountable infinity of fractal dust points which means that its fractal cantorian dimension is @xmath121 .",
    "thus the respective dimensions are dual to each other : @xmath122 , @xmath123 .",
    "the virtual sets of negative topological dimensions can be endowed with a physical meaning if we would view them as carriers of negative information entropy , or anti - entropy @xcite .",
    "such an interpretation is very close to dirac s sea of negative energy where we substitute negative entropy for the negative energy .",
    "the true vacuum of the theory requires the sea of negative topological dimensions located below the topological value of a zero dimension @xmath73 to be filled up .",
    "this is necessary for keeping the quantum universe from `` cascading '' down and disappearing in a void set @xmath124 .",
    "thus we arrive at the following result : the average dimensions obtained with the help of the cantorian fractal spacetime model , discrete sums average , and the integral average respectively satisfy the following relation :    @xmath125 the difference between various averages is surprisingly small , taking into account that our model uses smooth spheres and that @xmath0+@xmath5 is the exact result obtained by el nashie on the basis of the densest packing allowed and which generalizes the maudlin - williams golden mean theorem .",
    "the spaces are filled - in totally with `` fractal dust points '' .",
    "another values for the average dimension @xmath126 ( based on the knot theory and jones polynomial @xcite,@xcite ) and @xmath127 ( based on the leech lattice packing ) are only an approximation to the exact value of @xmath93=@xmath0+@xmath5 .",
    "this is due to the fact that these models used packing different form the densest packing .",
    "we believe that connection of the exact average dimension of the world to the golden mean is not a simple numerical coincidence .",
    "in fact , this value @xmath128 = @xmath0+@xmath5 indicates the onset of quasi - ergodicity @xcite,@xcite , that is the topological dimension is of the same order as the fractal dimension .",
    "@xmath129 represents a stable region and @xmath130 represent ergodic case .",
    "we are living in a metastable quasi - ergodic state or `` vacuum '' , @xmath93 = @xmath0+@xmath5 .",
    "on the other hand , the true vacuum , as was argued earlier ( in connection with @xmath131 and @xmath132 ) corresponds to the dual inverse fractal dimension of @xmath133 equal to @xmath134 ; or @xmath135 relative to the zero point @xmath136 .",
    "still the major question remains unanswered : why do we live in a @xmath137 dimensions ? to answer we have to consider the long range coarse - grain averaging process of a fractal geometry underlying the perceived spacetime of our existence .",
    "such an averaging process results in a breakdown of poly - dimensional isotropy .",
    "this means that prior to the break - down there are ( on average ) four orthogonal dimensions which separately can deviate from their respective values by the same amount @xmath138 . as the result",
    "the emerging average dimension is    @xmath139    after the breakdown of isotropy @xmath140 spatial dimensions plus @xmath141 temporal dimensions emerge . here",
    "the fluctuations of the temporal dimension is 3 times greater then the fluctuation @xmath142 of each of the spatial dimensions.the long - range coarse - grain averaging process could be viewed as a process of `` projecting '' el naschie s effective average @xmath0+@xmath5-dimensions onto the four - dimensional @xmath143 outer surface , which we perceive as our reality . as a result of the projection",
    "the initially orthogonal spatial and temporal dimensions will become entangled .",
    "a good analogy could be a two - dimensional view of a three dimensional knot .",
    "this could explain a perception of the three - spatial dimensions , at any given fixed moment of clock time .",
    "one can slice ( at least locally ) the four - dimensional spacetime into @xmath62-dimensional sheets at any given fixed value of the clock time resulting in a possibility of measurements in extended space at a fixed moment of time @xcite .",
    "inversely , it is difficult ( if not impossible ) for a macroscopic observer to perceive an extended interval of time , within an extended region of @xmath62-space . paraphrasing wheeler",
    ", we can say , `` space exists to prevent everything from happening one point '' .    on the other hand , in our model of infinite dimensions at the scales approaching planck scale particles can move forward and backward in time simply because they have access to more dimensions than we do .",
    "in other words , particles are fully `` aware '' of the fractality of spacetime .",
    "for example , they do not `` see '' the two slits in the two - slit experiment as two separate points since from their perspective spacetime is a discrete , fractal - like cantor set .",
    "when one constructs the cantor set by removing the middle segment @xmath144 , one is literally `` removing '' the space between the fractal dust points thus eliminating a separation between the slits . since at this scale there is no separation between the fractal dust points , the cantor set has zero measure = zero length .",
    "it is our mind which fills the void creating the illusion that there is a separation between the points of a fractal dust .",
    "this leads to the apparent `` non - locality '' and other paradoxes of quantum mechanics .",
    "nature does not abhor the vacuum , it is our mind which does so by filling in the voids .",
    "in fact , nature is not only quantum and discrete , it is fractal .",
    "thus the entanglement and long range averaging of the perturbed spatial and temporal dimensions yield the observed @xmath0-dimensional world .",
    "this means that within the framework of cantorian fractal spacetime we have the following entangled dimensions yielding the perceived @xmath0 dimensions    @xmath145 as a result of this process the golden mean appears once again as an essential parameter of reality . on a surface",
    "this looks like a forced fit to the preconceived notion . and",
    "really , why does not @xmath146 appear as a result of some other splitting ,",
    "say @xmath147 ? .",
    "it is obvious that there are infinite number of solutions @xmath148 satisfying suac splitting .",
    "however , to require that dimensional perturbation @xmath149 must be the only solution indicating the emergence of @xmath62-dimensional entangled imposes a very stringent constraint . we must mention that the condition @xmath149 satisfies the symmetric split @xmath150 between @xmath54 spatial , @xmath54 temporal , and the universal fluctuation @xmath151 .",
    "is all this just a numerical coincidence or design ?",
    "we can explain this situation from the lattice point of view .",
    "if we consider a quasi - ergodic self - similar fractal grid / lattice , or topologically equivalent fractal sphere of dimensionality @xmath0+@xmath5 the coarse - grain averaging process will break down the `` translational '' symmetry from      it transpires that our perception ( which by the very definition amounts to averaging ) of @xmath62 dimensions is in fact the long range coarse - grain effect of co - existence of @xmath153 ( spatial ) and @xmath154 ( temporal ) dimensions .",
    "the set @xmath155 whose dimension is @xmath0+@xmath5 is `` packed '' inside a four - dimensional sphere .",
    "this reminds a picture of the grains of sand on a beach .",
    "the sand `` looks '' two - dimensional to us when in fact it is @xmath62-dimensional . due to a coarse - graining effect we as macroscopic observers can only perceive the `` skin '' , or a @xmath62-dimensional outer surface ( where space and time co - exist ) of the `` onion''-like world .",
    "in other words , we perceive only projections onto the `` four - dimensional external surface '' of the average @xmath0+@xmath5 dimensions of a truly infinite - dimensional world lying figuratively speaking underneath our `` feet '' and above `` our heads '' .",
    "the four - dimensional `` skin '' encloses the exact average value of @xmath93=@xmath0+@xmath5 where averaging is performed over all possible topological dimensions ( ranging from @xmath156 to @xmath121 ) of the sets @xmath157 of cantorian fractal spacetime .",
    "a similar mechanism may be responsible for the chiral - symmetry breakdown in nature without supersymmetry .",
    "if there will be enough energy to move `` inside '' the `` skin '' into the transfinite continuum of cantorian spacetime we will be able to discover the true fractal average dimension of spacetime , at each layer(ladder ) of the renormalization group flow . from the renormalization group treatment of quantum field theory one can infer that the universe , upon reaching the metastable fixed point @xmath107 of the renormalization group will signal the beginning of a dimensional phase transition , from @xmath0+@xmath1 to @xmath5 . at this fixed point a conformal invariance exists which means that the world will become self - similar at every scale .    from this perspective",
    "it seems that theories of gravity and all other fundamental forces in nature are effective theories since they emerge from a deeper theory , namely a new relativity in cantorian fractal spacetime .",
    "in fact , vacuum fluctuations in cantorian fractal spacetime generate the long range einstein s gravity theory and all other fundamental forces `` residing '' inside spacetime .",
    "it has turned out that a new relativity allows one to write down the quantum master action @xcite for the `` master '' field residing in * c*-space , ( outside spacetime ) whose vacuum fluctuations generate classical spacetime , gravity and all other fundamental forces .",
    "we believe , this is a reason why attempts to quantize einstein s gravity have been futile so far .",
    "it looks as if cantorian fractal geometry is the bridge connecting both worlds , quantum and classical .",
    "therefore noncommutative geometry together with the renormalization group approach @xcite are mathematical tools allowing us to probe this cantorian fractal world @xcite .",
    "thus if general relativity required four - dimensional riemannian geometry for its formulation a new relativity requires the transfinite continuum of the noncommutative von neumann s cantorian fractal spacetime @xmath158 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "what we perceive as a smooth four - dimensional topological space ( a sphere , for example ) is an illusion .",
    "there are no `` points '' in this new relativity , due to the fact that the planck scale is the minimum distance in nature . as we zoom in using a `` microscope '' of the renormalization group",
    ", we uncover that each point is also a four - sphere , and that each point within that sphere is also four - dimensional , and so on and so forth ... @xmath159 .",
    "here we will present a solution to the cosmological `` constant '' problem which parallels nottale s derivation based on his scale relativity as well as el naschie s @xmath3 cantorian spacetime theory . depending either on the values of the `` constants '' @xmath160 of the previous section or initial conditions",
    ", one will have several different cosmological scenarios .",

    "we set the initial scaling time to be @xmath163 , since @xmath164 and logarithmic dependencies play an important part in scale relativity .    using ( 3.6 ) and the scale relativity we get    @xmath165 \\over log~ [   { \\cal e } /kt_p ] } = ( t / t_o)^\\alpha.\\ ] ]    @xmath166   \\over log~ [ { \\cal r } / \\lambda   ] }   = ( t / t_o)^\\beta    \\eqno   ( 4.1))\\ ] ] since we introduce the time dependence of the parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 we have two different values of the vacuum energy : @xmath167 denotes the vacuum energy at a given time @xmath162 and @xmath30 denotes the initial vacuum energy .",
    "the average value of the dimension is respectively :    @xmath168    where @xmath169 and @xmath170 are the constants entering nottale s scale relativity @xcite , and @xmath171 is the universal scaling exponent . equation ( 4.2 ) mean that the average dimension changes monotonically with scaling time . on the other hand , eq.(4.1 )",
    "postulates a power - scaling law for the ratios of the fundamental constants in nature . according to nottale s scale relativity",
    "the scaling coefficient themselves are resolution - dependent .",
    "however for the simplicity sake we assume that they are universal constants .    in appendix",
    "b it is shown that the slope @xmath172 of entropy vs. area diverges between the values @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "this represents an onset of a dimensional phase transition , that is the universe has reached @xmath175 and begins its transition to the quasi - crystal phase characterized by @xmath176 ( or to @xmath177 if we take @xmath178 as zero reference point ) . to study this process in more details",
    "one needs to consider nottale s scale relativistic resolution - dependent coefficients @xmath169 and @xmath179 . at the critical point",
    "these three coefficients are connected by a certain relation which is typical for critical phenomena .",
    "for example if initially , at the planck era the vacuum energy @xmath180 was of the same order of magnitude as the thermal planck energy @xmath181 then generally speaking its value will subsequently change ( with the renormalization group flow ) to a much smaller value @xmath182 of today .",
    "however @xmath180 still will be large in comparison with today s background thermal energy of @xmath183 kelvins .",
    "we would like to reiterate that in a new relativity it makes sense to speak only about relations between quantities ( and by implication about the respective ratios ) . in this sense a concept of a very small is intrinsically connected with a concept of a very large .",
    "the quantities @xmath184 are respectively the vacuum energies and sizes of the original baby universes at the `` initial '' scaling time of @xmath163 , at the beginning of the `` count down '' .",
    "this means that the scaling `` clock '' starts ticking at the moment when the radius of the hyper - sphere is @xmath185 and the value of the vacuum energy is @xmath52 . after that moment",
    "infinitesimal perturbations of both , the radius and energy will begin to grow .",
    "this results in the following physical picture .    initially the vacuum fluctuations about the perfect balance conditions",
    "@xmath186 = @xmath187= @xmath11 were infinitesimally small . however , because the system has an infinite degrees of freedom these fluctuations could not have been damped , and this would have lead to a disruption of equilibrium .",
    "inversely , had the number of degrees of freedom be finite the infinitesimal perturbations would have been damped and equilibrium would have been restored .",
    "thus , as a result of infinite number of degrees of freedom the universe was driven out of balance , out of the metastable state of average dimension @xmath0+@xmath5 , to states of higher and higher average dimensions , until it reached a maximum average dimension which depends on initial perturbations and the non - linear dynamics of the system.after reaching the maximum average dimension , the universe began its `` descent '' from this maximum to the initial value of @xmath20 = @xmath0 + @xmath5 .    since the initial perturbations drove the average dimension to a value higher than @xmath0 + @xmath5 one might be inclined to think that the average temperature will also surpass the planck temperature @xmath39.however this is a wrong conclusion since according to a new relativity the effective values of the boltzamann constant @xmath188 and planck constant @xmath189 are energy dependent ( see e.g , appendix a ) .",
    "both constants increase in such a way as to keep the temperature below @xmath39 .",
    "for example , a very energetic photon of frequency @xmath190 being emitted by the walls of the reservoir can not exceed the upper temperature bound of @xmath191 .    as we discussed earlier , during the initial chaotic phase the quantum - dissipative effects re - heat the expanding universe in such a way as to keep @xmath39 constant .",
    "after the universe had reached its maximum average dimension , it began to `` roll down '' , in both dimensions and temperature : the ordered - phase began .",
    "the renormalization group local scaling arrow of time also appeared at the moment when the universe started its descent back to the metastable point .",
    "prior to that there was no arrow of time since when the universe was in perfect balance nothing changed , nothing `` happened '' .",
    "spacetime as we know it did not exist and emerged only afterwards .",
    "the universe began due to a non - equilibrium process of self - organization as was argued long ago by prigogine .",
    "as the universe moves from higher average dimensions and higher vacuum energies , to lower dimensions and lower vacuum energies , information is lost .",
    "since the total entropy of the universe plus reservoir can not decrease , this means that entropy flowed out of the universe into the reservoir which comprises the infinite family of hyper - spheres of all possible dimensions and radii .",
    "the quanta of spacetime create their own background in which all the @xmath9-branes live in ; this background is self - referential and self - supporting .    keeping in line with the second law of thermodynamics , the information entropy which flows out of a universe into the self - referential thermal background",
    "is recycled over and over again due to the bootstrap principle , i.e. , the quanta / hyper - spheres are made of each other .",
    "this recycling process of information - energy - dimensions bootstrapping , the creation of the fundamental particles in the universe and its life forms occurs in a hierarchical multi - fractal fashion . accordingly",
    "self - organization proceeds in discrete jumps from a smaller scale to a larger scale , to a larger scale , etc",
    ". therefore we subscribe to penrose s view that consciousness is a non - algorithmic process which is compatible with our idea that an uncountable infinity of dimensions implies existence of an uncountable infinity of information leading to the emergence of conscious life .",
    "as the emerging local scaling time begins its `` count '' the values of the `` universal constants '' begin change with `` time '' .",
    "this process is consistent with a modern theory of variable speed of light cosmologies which gains a certain support . choosing a simple situation characterized by @xmath192 and @xmath193 we get from ( 5.1 )    @xmath194   ^{(t / t_o)^\\alpha } = 1 .",
    "\\eqno ( 4.3)\\ ] ] from eq.(4.3 ) follows that in this simple case for all values of renormalization group scaling time the following is true    @xmath195    taking , for example , @xmath196 we find from ( 4.4 ) that according to this simple scenario the present - day value of the vacuum energy should be    @xmath197 this result means that the present vacuum energy would be huge as compared to the thermal energy @xmath198 .",
    "this might serve as a very straightforward explanation of the fact that today s universe is expanding much more rapidly than was predicted by the existing theories .",
    "the explanation follows as a natural result of a new relativity theory and cantorian fractal spacetime which in turn might be viewed as an indirect proof that the respective world view may be correct , or at least points in the right direction .",
    "let us look at the famous experiments @xmath199 .",
    "the @xmath200 value of @xmath183 kelvins was obtained by `` looking '' into the past of the universe .",
    "the photons we detect today were emitted in the past and were redshifted due to the expansion of the universe . since the speed of light in a new relativity changes with the renormalization group flow , calculation of the exact values of the redshifts is going to be a rather difficult task .",
    "the correct way to do this would be to carry out integration along the renormalization group trajectory backwards in scaling time ( cf .",
    "use of convective derivatives in fluid mechanics ) to find out the true frequency of the photons upon emission .    in the widely accepted theories `` past '' refers to the big bang . on the other hand",
    ", there was no big bang in our cosmological scenario .",
    "our model implies an ever expanding universe where expansion begins from the moment when the infinitesimal perturbations drove the universe out of balance . by expansion we mean a synchronous change of universe s radius with the renormalization group flow representing the true arrow of time .",
    "since the average dimension of the universe changes in the process it leads to a change of the respective volume even for a fixed radius . however to take the volume of the hyper - spheres as an indicator of temporal evolution is not a good idea .",
    "the radius is the more appropriate indicator of change .",
    "quite analogously to the radius being an indicator of the renormalization group flow , the cobe data s temperature @xmath201 may also serve as an appropriate `` thermometer '' of the evolving ensemble of an infinite number of bubbles / universes .",
    "for this reason , in this model , one could set @xmath202 and conclude that within the model the vacuum energy today would be of the order @xmath203 .",
    "another way to look at the cobe data is to look for deviations from the @xmath204 kelvin due to a greater redshifts caused by a greater expansion of a cooling universe .",
    "recent experimental work by de bernardis _ et al _ and the recent boomerang data indicates that this is the case @xcite .",
    "the renormalization group scaling time changes rather slowly as compared to the coordinate time of our clocks since the former is logarithmic and the latter is roughly linear . in turn",
    "the fundamental constants of nature change with respect to the renormalization group scaling time , and for this reason they change very slowly as compared to our daily experience .",
    "for example , the speed of light at the time of relativity formulation was essentially the same as today .",
    "however , this was not the case when the universe began its evolution at the planck era .",
    "at that period the fundamental constants changed more rapidly .",
    "we are living now in a metastable phase ( a slow , `` predictable '' ) and for this reason life was possible at this stage of evolution .",
    "it would be hard ( if not impossible ) for life forms to emerge during a phase where the fundamental constants changed rapidly relative to the renormalization group scaling time flow .",
    "such a rate of change corresponds to the situation where the information - entropy is no longer a linear function of the area which in turn is a result of taking into account the infinitely - dimensional picture of the universe ( appendix b ) . as for ourselves",
    ", we are living in a linear world where information - entropy transfer per unit area is constant .",
    "this is another reason why @xmath205 are the optimum dimensions conducive for the appearance of humans , which is consistent with the average dimension @xmath206 .",
    "let us look at the cosmological constant @xmath207 in today s @xmath0-dimensional world .",
    "it has units of a @xmath208 because it must have the dimensions of curvature appearing in einstein s equations .",
    "the units of @xmath209 are also the same as the units of a string tension , namely energy per unit length .",
    "let us now compare today s @xmath207 with the cosmological `` constant '' at the moment when the scaling renormalization group time was launched ( at the planck era ) by simply evaluating the ratios of energy / length .",
    "one can argue that at the very beginning the large scale structure of spacetime ( as we know it ) did not even exist .",
    "spacetime was barely born at that moment .",
    "therefore einstein s equations could not be applied and this period is a truly quantum gravity period .",
    "still we can compute the relevant numbers , at least crudely .    setting the vacuum energies to be of the same orders of magnitude as their compton energies , @xmath210 and @xmath211 and using eqs.(4.3 - 4.5 ) we arrive at the following ratios of the cosmological `` constants '' : @xmath212    let us assume for the sake of the argument that one could take the upper nottale scale to be @xmath213 @xmath214 @xmath215 @xmath216 . using this assumption in ( 4.6 )",
    "we obtain the following ratio of the cosmological `` constants '' :    @xmath217 this result implies that the cosmological `` constant '' ( when the world was of the planck radius - a mini - black hole ) was 122 orders of magnitude larger than the cosmological `` constant '' of the universe having the maximum radius of @xmath218 .",
    "once again we wish to emphasize that we are referring to the radius of the universe since in general dimensions change and therefore it is wrong to compare volumes at different epochs .    at another limit",
    "the universe would move to an extremely cold world of minimum @xmath219 which is close to zero but not zero .",
    "in fact if the minimum @xmath220 this would contradict the duality of nature requiring that maximum @xmath39 must be dual to a minimum @xmath10 temperature since in this case @xmath221 .",
    "the state corresponding to @xmath219 is the noncommutative quasi - crystal phase of the coldest world whose dimension @xmath222 .",
    "this means that as the universe reaches the renormalization group metastable point of @xmath223 it would begin to move very slowly towards another phase transition and not less slowly proceed to a very cold world whose lowest temperature @xmath219 will be 122 orders of magnitude smaller than the planck temperature @xmath39 that is @xmath224 kelvin .",
    "at a first glance it seems that the assumption about inverse proportionality of vacuum energy and the scale ( that is @xmath225 ) contradicts eq.(4.4 ) which states that the energy is proportional to the scale .",
    "however after performing the duality transformation @xmath226 in eq.(4.4 ) and leaving @xmath227 unchanged we obtain    @xmath228 it is immediately seen that eq.(4.8 ) is in full agreement with the statement that @xmath229 . moreover , combining eq.(4.4 ) and ( 4.8 ) we arrive at eq.(4.7 ) .",
    "interestingly enough , if we apply the duality transformation to a bubble of planck radius , and planck temperature @xmath39 , we find that the planck scale is `` self dual '' in the sense that the compton wavelength associated with the planck s mass @xmath230 is in excellent agreement with the value of its schwarzchild radius , @xmath231 .",
    "but this is precisely how one defines the planck scale from the very beginning .",
    "as we have already indicated , the universe will keep expanding until it will asymptotically approach the upper nottale scale @xmath232 , reaching the final quasi - crystal phase .",
    "the scale relativistic corrections prohibit scales exceeding @xmath232 .",
    "this restriction serves as the natural infrared regulator which is analogous to viewing the planck scale as the natural ultraviolet regulator .",
    "the relation between the two represents the duality of uv / ir . on the other hand",
    ", the ultimate scale @xmath232 corresponds to the lowest temperature @xmath219 dual to the maximum attainable temperature @xmath39 ( a postulate of thermal relativity ) .",
    "this means that the universe s evolution from the minimum planck scale @xmath233 to the nottale s maximum scale @xmath234 is accompanied by a change of the temperature from the maximum temperature @xmath235 to the minimum ( dual ) temperature @xmath236 .    between these 2 limits",
    "the universe can `` hover '' in the metastable state ( @xmath93 = @xmath0 + @xmath5 = @xmath237 ) long enough to favor an emergence of a conscious life .",
    "this will continue until the whole ensemble of infinite quanta ( bubbles , universes ) begins its collective slow evolution towards the lower ( true vacuum ) stable state of average dimension @xmath238 ( or @xmath239 if considered relative to the @xmath240 ) of extremely cold temperatures transforming itself into a quasi - crystal state .",
    "the phase transition to the lower dimensions could be viewed as the `` big crunch '' which transforms the universe into a `` pancake '' .",
    "the latter is consistent with the observational data @xcite .",
    "the disruption of the metastable state is caused by vacuum fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations can be arbitrarily large due to the fact that the ensemble of universes comprises an infinity of quanta ( bubbles of different dimensions and radii ) .",
    "an analogous situation arises in the field theory where quantum fluctuations can become large since the respective systems have an infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the quasi - crystal will eventually reach an enormous size while evolving towards the regime of the minimal energy density configuration .",
    "in fact this follows directly form eq.(4.7 ) which tells us that the final value of the cosmological `` constant '' will be dramatically smaller than it was at the birth of the universe .",
    "this regime ( if it will be reached in a final time interval ) will indicate the `` end '' of spacetime , matter , energy, ... and life .",
    "still we should not despair since it is quite possible that the cold quasi - crystallized ensemble will `` collide '' ( in c - space , outside spacetime ) with another ensemble of much higher vacuum energy , higher temperatures ( we are assuming a `` multi - verse '' ) , and the world will again begin to reheat and climb up the dimensional ladder , evolving towards the metastable state of @xmath241 . vacuum fluctuations will trigger another life cycle of the emerging universe ( in general different from the one that descended into quasi - crystal state ) , and the process will repeat itself time and time again . a more rigorous picture of this cyclical universes scenario requires the construction of the quantum field theory in noncommutative c - spaces @xcite .",
    "we can speculate that this `` cosmic dance '' has been going on forever , and it will continue on forever within a cyclical scaling time associated with the renormalization group flow .",
    "the cyclical renormalization group scaling time is the true universal arrow of time .",
    "its existence is predicated on the existence of negative dimensions ( a new relativity sea of negative dimensions ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the time measured by our clocks is just one of the coordinates which is interchangeable with any other coordinate , the fact following from the diffeomorphic invariance of general relativity .",
    "our arguments showing that there is `` no cosmological constant problem '' in a new relativity agree with nottale s arguments who explained in simple terms a huge discrepancy between the cosmological `` constant '' measured at the cosmological scales , with the cosmological `` constant '' measured at planck scales .",
    "it was necessary to formulate scale relativity to point out an existence of a dependence of measurements scales on a frame of reference . in a new relativity theory",
    ", there is no such thing as the cosmological `` constant problem '' because all the constants in nature are subject to renormalization group flow with scaling time .",
    "it is precisely because of a process of self - organization and self - tuning that all the constants in nature properly adjust themselves to the renormalization group scaling flow , or arrow of time .",
    "such arrow of time itself materialized only because the world emerged from a strongly non - equilibrium state .",
    "here we determine the exact value of the minimum non - zero temperature of the quasi - crystal phase .",
    "we will see that is directly related to the maximum upper scale in nature which ( as we already indicated ) is dual to the planck minimum scale .",
    "nottale already gave estimates of what this scale should be .",
    "however at that time he was not aware of the power of the duality principle provided by the string theory and therefore had no way of knowing how to calculate the maximum upper scale from the basic principles . on the other hand , we will utilize duality and provide such an evaluation .",
    "this duality between the large and the small is at the heart of the uv / ir entanglement of quantum field theory in noncommutative spaces .",
    "if the upper scale were infinity , and the lowest scale were zero , such an entanglement would nt be possible .",
    "the spacetime coordinates of a noncommutative space do not commute because the planck scale is not zero , i.e @xmath242 \\sim \\lambda^2 $ ] .",
    "this property represents one of natural consequences of a new relativity : ordinary `` point '' coordinates @xmath243 are to be replaced by clifford - algebra valued * x * multi - vectors ( matrices ) .",

    "<S> cantorian fractal spacetime , a family member of von neumann s noncommutative geometry , is introduced as a geometry underlying a new relativity theory which is similar to the relation between general relativity and riemannian geometry . </S>",
    "<S> based on this model and the new relativity theory an ensemble distribution of all the dimensions of quantum spacetime is derived with the help of fermat last theorem . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated average dimension is very close to the value of @xmath0+@xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the golden mean ) obtained by el naschie on the basis of a different approach . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that within the framework of the new relativity the cosmological constant problem is nonexistent , since the universe self - organizes and self - tunes according to the renormalization group ( rg ) flow with respect to a local scaling microscopic arrow of time . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the world emerged as a result of a non - equilibrium process of self - organized critical phenomena launched by vacuum fluctuations in cantorian fractal spacetime @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that we are living in a metastable vacuum and are moving towards a fixed point ( @xmath4 = @xmath0 + @xmath5 ) of the rg . after reaching this point </S>",
    "<S> , a new phase transition will drive the universe to a quasi - crystal phase of the lower average dimension of @xmath5 . </S>"
