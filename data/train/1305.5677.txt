    "the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the proton are of fundamental importance for modern particle physics .",
    "not only do they describe our current knowledge about the internal structure and symmetries of this basic building block of matter and represent an important baseline for nuclear structure and deconfinement studies , but they also enter in the theoretical description of all hadron collider experiments , precision determinations of standard model parameters and new physics searches , in particular those at the energy frontier of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , as only partonic , but not hadronic cross sections are calculable in perturbative qcd .",
    "consequently , a large part of the hera physics program at desy @xcite and many global analysis efforts @xcite have been devoted to improving on this knowledge over the last decades .",
    "deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) , now including a combination of h1 and zeus data from the hera-1 run @xcite and complemented at large values of bjorken @xmath3 by older fixed target data @xcite , still provides the most important single source of information .",
    "it constrains in particular the ( valence ) quark densities , as the gluon density enters only at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and can thus only be determined from scaling violations .",
    "the decomposition of the light quark flavours can then be constrained by neutrino structure function data @xcite and the strange quark density from dimuon production in neutrino dis @xcite , while the charm structure function @xmath4 , and to a lesser extent @xmath5 for the bottom quark , are directly accessible at hera @xcite .    traditionally , the gluon density has long been constrained with prompt photon data @xcite through the qcd compton process @xmath6 .",
    "however , photon isolation and fragmentation uncertainties have proven difficult to overcome ( the situation is only now improving with the advent of the lhc data @xcite ) , and long - standing disagreements in the low - transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) regime have given rise to speculations on the importance of an intrinsic @xmath1 of the partons in the proton @xcite .",
    "recent global analyses @xcite therefore abstain from the use of prompt - photon data , replacing it with better understood data ( e.g.  due to new jet algorithms ) on inclusive jet production from dis at hera @xcite ( but so far not from photoproduction @xcite due to the uncertainty on the photon structure function @xcite ) and from proton - antiproton collisions at the tevatron @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the drell - yan like production of electroweak @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath0 @xcite bosons through quark - antiquark fusion to charged leptons and neutrinos helps to constrain the up and down quark and antiquark densities with a different weighting than dis data . and",
    "@xmath8 production ratios at the lhc on the up and down quark pdfs see ref .",
    "@xcite . ]    in two previous publications that have received considerable attention @xcite , e.l .",
    "berger and one of us ( m.k . ) pointed out the possibility to use lepton pairs with relatively small invariant mass @xmath9 as a surrogate for prompt photons .",
    "we demonstrated that at intermediate values of @xmath1 of the lepton pair , its production begins to be dominated by a qcd `` compton '' process @xmath10 , with the real photon replaced by a virtual photon that transforms subsequently into a low - mass lepton pair .",
    "this would allow to use this process for the determination of the gluon density , also in fixed - target experiments and at large @xmath3 , where it is badly constrained , while @xmath9 and @xmath1 are still high enough to allow for the application of perturbative qcd .",
    "this was established by comparing a calculation with soft - gluon resummation at the next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) level to the pure nlo result @xcite . in a follow - up publication @xcite",
    ", we extended this idea to polarized scattering processes , pointing out the great sensitivity e.g.  of experiments at rhic to the largely unconstrained polarized gluon density .    with the much higher center - of - mass energies of @xmath2 and 8 tev that have become available at the lhc during the last three years and that will rise to 14 tev after the current shut - down",
    ", it is quite natural to ask if electroweak boson production can not play a similar role to virtual photons .",
    "the reason is that at such high energies , the @xmath7- and @xmath0-boson masses of about 80 and 91 gev will become more and more negligible , so that quark - gluon scattering should again quickly take over from quark - antiquark scattering .",
    "therefore , contrary to current practice , where @xmath7- and @xmath0-boson production are only used in the drell - yan mode at low @xmath1 to constrain the quark flavour decomposition and in particular the shape of the ratio @xmath11 ( down- over up - quark pdfs ) @xcite , it should soon become possible to also constrain better the gluon density , in particular at large @xmath3 .",
    "this is the goal of our present work . in sec .  2",
    ", we will first review the current status of parton densities in the proton on the basis of the uncertainty estimates provided by the three widely used global analyses ct10 @xcite , mstw08 @xcite and nnpdf2.1 @xcite .",
    "we will do this at two different scales , i.e.  at the scale of the electroweak boson and at a high scale corresponding to large transverse momenta , and emphasizing both the low-@xmath3 and high-@xmath3 regimes . in sec .  3",
    ", we will establish the reliability of our calculation by confronting it to @xmath2 tev lhc data on @xmath0 and @xmath7 production with transverse momenta up to 600 and 300 gev , published recently by the cms @xcite and atlas @xcite collaborations , respectively .",
    "we will in particular address the question up to which transverse momenta soft - gluon radiation must be resummed and at which @xmath1 the nlo perturbative calculation starts to be reliable .",
    "is devoted to an investigation of the different partonic contributions , i.e.  at which @xmath1 the quark - gluon process starts to take over from the drell - yan like quark - antiquark process , while in sec .",
    "5 we make concrete predictions in the perturbative regime for @xmath7 and @xmath0 production up to large transverse momenta , where the pdfs and in particular the gluon density can be constrained .",
    "for completeness , we also show the sensitivity in the low-@xmath1 regime .",
    "our conclusions and an outlook are given in sec .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the current status of parton density uncertainties in the low- and high-@xmath3 regimes and their evolution from small to large scales . as a baseline",
    ", we use the best ct10 nlo global fit @xmath12 @xcite , which we show together with its uncertainty band computed as ^+f&= & , + ^-f&= & , where @xmath13 are the pdfs for positive and negative variations of the pdf parameters along the @xmath14-th eigenvector direction in the 26-dimensional pdf parameter space . in order to estimate the bias coming , e.g. , from different parameterizations of the @xmath3-dependence at the starting scale",
    ", we also show the best fits of the mstw08 @xcite and nnpdf2.1 @xcite global analyses .",
    "as it is usually done , we plot in all cases @xmath3 times the pdf , i.e.  the momentum distribution of the partons in the proton .",
    "first , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] the gluon pdf ( reduced by a factor of 20 ) ,    the up - quark and the strange - quark pdfs at the factorization scale @xmath15 ( top ) , adequate for electroweak boson production at low transverse momenta , and at a higher scale of @xmath16 tev ( bottom ) , relevant for high-@xmath1 vector boson production . in this figure",
    ", a logarithmic @xmath3-axis has been chosen , which emphasizes the low-@xmath3 regime . in this region ,",
    "the sea - quark dominated up- and strange - quark pdfs largely overlap , so that for better visibility no central values , but only the uncertainty band is shown for the latter .",
    "as is well known , the uncertainty highly increases below values of @xmath17 , where only little information is available from pre - lhc experiments .",
    "the evolution from low ( top ) to high ( bottom ) scales resums multiple parton splitting , increasing the densities of gluons and sea quarks at small @xmath3 and at the same time reducing the ( mostly valence - quark ) pdfs at large @xmath3 .",
    "since the @xmath18-dependence is perturbatively calculable , the pdfs at high @xmath19 become less dependent on the non - perturbative input at the starting scale @xmath20 , so that their uncertainty , due to fit of the unknown @xmath3-dependence at @xmath21 to experimental data , is reduced .",
    "the shift of the up - quark , but also the gluon ( and induced strange - quark ) pdfs from larger to smaller @xmath3-values with the evolution from @xmath15 to @xmath16 tev is more clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] with its linear @xmath3-axis .    here , up",
    "quarks ( which have a valence - quark contribution ) and strange quarks ( which do not ) are well separated , so that we now also show the central values for the latter .",
    "it is obvious that the ct10 uncertainty band , induced by the experimental data , does not cover in all cases the central values of mstw08 and nnpdf2.1 , demonstrating the important influence of the theoretical bias on the @xmath3-parametrization at the starting scale @xmath20 .",
    "if we focus now on the gluon pdf at large @xmath3 , we can see that it is much less constrained than the up - quark pdf , directly probed at hera and in other dis experiments . at the lower scale @xmath15 , the gluon uncertainty parametrized by ct10 amounts at @xmath22 and @xmath23 to considerable + 21/-18 % and + 40/-30 % , respectively .",
    "the evolution to @xmath16 tev does not significantly change this uncertainty , amounting there to + 22/-17 % and + 43/-28 % , respectively .",
    "contrary to the strange - quark pdfs , the central mstw08 and nnpdf2.1 gluon pdf fits are covered by the ct10 uncertainty bands .    in the three global analyses discussed above ,",
    "lhc data have not yet been included .",
    "however , the new ct10 next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) pdfs @xcite have been compared with the total @xmath7 and @xmath0 cross sections at 7 and 8 tev with the result that they agree within the still substantial errors .",
    "also the @xmath7 and @xmath0 rapidity distributions as well as the @xmath7 charge asymmetry at 7 tev have been found to agree within errors .",
    "these data are obtained in a drell - yan situation at small @xmath1 and , when included in future global pdf analyses , will mostly influence the quark pdfs at small @xmath3 , in particular the in this region badly constrained valence quarks .",
    "this requires , however , the theoretical predictions for the partonic scattering cross sections including soft - gluon resummation to be under control @xcite .",
    "as our previous calculations for low - mass lepton - pair production in hadron collisions @xcite , our theoretical predictions for massive electroweak gauge - boson production at the lhc are based on a full nlo calculation matched to soft - gluon resummation at the nll level @xcite .",
    "this allows us to establish in this section the regions in @xmath1 where the perturbative results are reliable and where they have to be supplemented by a resummation procedure to all orders in the strong coupling constant @xmath24 .",
    "this @xmath1-resummation is based on the collins - soper - sterman formalism @xcite and is evaluated in impact parameter ( @xmath25 ) space .",
    "the differential cross section for the production of a vector boson @xmath26 from two hadrons @xmath27 and @xmath28 is thus written as = 1(2)^2(q^2-m_v^2 ) ^2be^i_t_j|k(b , q , x_1,x_2)+y(p_t , q , x_1,x_2 ) , where @xmath19 and @xmath29 are the invariant mass and rapidity of the vector boson and @xmath30 are the momentum fractions of the interacting partons @xmath31 and @xmath32 . the regular piece , denoted @xmath33 , is obtained by subtracting the terms , which are singular in @xmath1 , from the exact fixed - order result . the form factor @xmath34",

    "a renormalization group analysis @xcite exhibits a logarithmic dependence of the non - perturbative function @xmath40 on the starting scale @xmath20 of the pdfs , which turns , however , out to be negligible in practice .",
    "its @xmath25- and @xmath3-dependence must be fitted to experimental data .",
    "we use a gaussian parametrization by brock , landry , nadolsky and yuan ( blny ) ^np_j|k(b , q , q_0,x_1,x_2)&= & -g_1-g_2-g_1g_3(100x_1x_2)b^2 with the three parameters @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 and evolved from the starting scale @xmath44 gev , which has been shown to fit the tevatron run-1 data on @xmath0-boson production very well @xcite .",
    "our theoretical predictions computed in this way are compared in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] to cms data on @xmath0-boson production at @xmath2 tev    @xcite .",
    "the data were presented by the cms collaboration normalized to the total cross section and with combined statistical and systematic uncertainties , individually for decay electrons and muons with @xmath45 and as a combination .",
    "they extend to @xmath1 values of 600 gev for the @xmath0-boson .",
    "we only show the combination in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , where we have multiplied our @xmath0-boson cross section , computed with our baseline pdf set ct10 @xcite and integrated over @xmath46 , with the relevant branching fractions @xcite .",
    "as one can observe , the region , where resummation is needed to describe the data , extends to values of @xmath47 gev . below this point ,",
    "the perturbative calculation ( dotted ) diverges logarithmically due to multiple soft - gluon radiation and must be resummed ( dashed ) , while above the regular , non - logarithmic terms due to hard , non - collinear radiation can no longer be neglected as it is done in the resummation calculation",
    ". the failure of the soft - gluon approximation in the transition region is exhibited by the fact that the resummation prediction becomes negative there and must be matched to the perturbative result by re - expanding it , subtracting from it the divergent terms , and then adding the perturbative result to obtain a prediction valid in all regions ( full curve ) .",
    "the comparison of our theoretical predictions with the experimental data is excellent over the full region in @xmath1 .",
    "similarly good agreement has been found by the cms collaboration with predictions based on the powheg nlo monte carlo generator with parton showers , which effectively also resum the leading logarithms at small values of @xmath1 @xcite .    in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , we compare our theoretical predictions to atlas data on @xmath7-boson production at @xmath2 tev @xcite . similarly to cms , the atlas collaboration present their results normalized to the total cross section and for a combination of weak bosons decaying to electrons and muons , measured now with @xmath48 .",
    "the decay neutrinos of course escape detection .",
    "the @xmath1-spectrum of the @xmath7 boson is then obtained through a two - step unfolding procedure up to values of 300 gev .",
    "the theoretical behaviour is very similar to the one for @xmath0-boson production , except that the transition from the region dominated by large logarithms to the perturbative regime occurs at slightly smaller values of @xmath49 gev .",
    "this can be attributed to the other hard scale in the process , the mass of the @xmath7 boson , which is with 80.385 gev somewhat smaller than the @xmath0-boson mass of 91.188 gev @xcite .",
    "if we assume the rapidity region of the @xmath7-boson , not given explicitly by the atlas experiment , to be @xmath46 , we obtain again very good agreement with the experimental data , although the normalization to the total cross section renders the prediction almost insensitive to the exact value of this cut .",
    "the experimentalists obtain similarly good agreement when comparing to the resummation program resbos @xcite .",
    "an important question is how the resummation and perturbative regions change when moving from current lhc experiments with @xmath2 tev to those in the future , which will be conducted with collision energies up to 14 tev .",
    "we have investigated this question with the result ( not shown explicitly ) that for @xmath0 bosons the pure resummation result then starts to deviate strongly from the total prediction at values of @xmath50 gev , whereas for @xmath7 bosons this point is reached at @xmath51 gev . on the other hand ,",
    "our calculations indicate that the reach in @xmath1 , which was 600 ( 300 ) gev for @xmath0 ( @xmath7 ) bosons produced at @xmath2 tev with an integrated luminosity of 35.9 ( 31 ) pb@xmath38 , should increase to the multi - tev range , i.e.  at least 2 tev , at @xmath52 tev and an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath38 . at the end of 2012 ,",
    "already more than 23 fb@xmath38 had been recorded by atlas and cms each with @xmath53 tev .",
    "it would thus already be interesting to analyse these data for electroweak vector boson production with high @xmath1 .",
    "the next question that arises is then at which values of @xmath1 electroweak boson production starts to be dominated by the qcd `` compton '' processes @xmath54 and @xmath55 , just as low - mass lepton pairs ( with invariant mass below @xmath56 ) were dominated by virtual photon radiation through the process @xmath57 .",
    "+ the importance of the quark - gluon scattering process is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "in fact , at a proton - proton collision energy of    @xmath2 tev it is sufficient for the transverse momentum of the produced @xmath0 ( top ) or @xmath7 ( bottom ) boson to exceed 20 or 15 gev .",
    "the quark - gluon process then remains at a level of 75 - 80% almost up to the kinematic limit , more precisely up to 3 tev , before quark - antiquark fusion takes over again .",
    "note that in this figure we show only the subprocesses that exist already at leading order . at nlo and",
    "beyond , other processes like @xmath58 and @xmath59 with @xmath60 enter as well , but they remain at the level of a few percent .",
    "this statement depends of course on the factorization scheme and scale , which we choose to be the @xmath61 scheme and @xmath62 , identical to the renormalization scale @xmath63",
    ". this choice should in principle provide for an optimal stability of the perturbative calculation in the low- and high-@xmath1 regions .",
    "+ the dominance of the @xmath64 subprocess persists at higher collision energies of @xmath52 tev , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "the peak contribution is even a bit larger and reaches more than 85% at @xmath65 gev . a local minimum of about 70% exists at intermediate values of @xmath66 tev . in figs .",
    "[ fig:4 ] and [ fig:5 ] we have in addition introduced a second , upper @xmath3-axis .",
    "it shows an estimator for the values of bjorken-@xmath3 , more precisely @xmath67 , at which the parton distributions in the colliding protons are probed .",
    "it is clear that at the very large values of @xmath1 accessible with high lhc luminosities and energies of 14 ( and also 8) tev , it should be possible to probe and constrain the gluon density where it is not well known .",
    "having established the reliability of our calculations in the resummation and perturbative regimes as well as the dominance of the quark - antiquark and quark - gluon subprocesses at small and intermediate to large transverse momenta , we can now confront the current status of uncertainties on the quark and gluon pdfs in the proton with the prospects for improving on their determination with electroweak boson production at the lhc .    to this end",
    ", we compute in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ratios of transverse - momentum    spectra for @xmath0 ( top ) and @xmath7 ( bottom ) bosons using various pdfs to our baseline prediction with ct10 pdfs . while this figure shows results for the lhc with @xmath2 tev , fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] shows these ratios for    @xmath0-boson production at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath52 tev .",
    "if one accounts for a rescaling of transverse momenta by a factor of two , these figures are very similar .",
    "results for @xmath53 tev are therefore not shown , as they lie naturally in between , close to the results of @xmath2 tev . with a total luminosity of more than 23 fb@xmath38 collected by atlas and",
    "cms each at @xmath53 tev , a range in @xmath1 up to 1 tev or more can be expected .",
    "this corresponds to values of bjorken-@xmath3 or , more precisely @xmath68 ( upper @xmath3-axis ) , of about 0.3 or more .    in our discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we had observed that the gluon uncertainty at @xmath22 and @xmath23 parametrized by ct10 is quite large and reaches at the scale @xmath16 tev values of + 22/-17 % and + 43/-28 % , respectively .",
    "since the qcd `` compton '' process contributes here more than 75% to the total cross section , this uncertainty is directly reflected in figs .",
    "[ fig:6 ] and [ fig:7 ] through the yellow ct10 uncertainty bands .",
    "the quark pdfs are dominated in this region by the valence contribution and add only little to the total uncertainty .",
    "the alternative pdf determinations by mstw08 ( dashed ) and nnpdf2.1 ( dotted ) follow in this region the lower boundary of the ct10 uncertainty band , which is based on a hessian treatment of the experimental statistical error with fixed tolerance ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the mstw08 and nnpdf2.1 uncertainty bands are smaller than the one from the ct10 , in particular due to a dynamic and smaller tolerance ( @xmath70 ) and a different ( monte carlo ) sampling of the statistical error and cross validation , respectively , but also due to different input data , values of @xmath24 , treatments of heavy quarks and experimental systematic errors , parametrisations etc .",
    "the scale uncertainty ( red lines ) , estimated in the conventional way by varying the factorization and renormalization scales simultaneously by a factor of two up and down about the central scale @xmath71 , stays with @xmath72 to @xmath73 % considerably smaller than the ct10 pdf uncertainty alone and of course also the envelope of all three pdf uncertainties . with threshold resummation ,",
    "computed e.g.  with soft - collinear effective theory , the scale uncertainty reduces to about @xmath74 % at large @xmath1 @xcite . measurements of electroweak boson production with transverse momenta of 1 tev or beyond at @xmath75 7 , 8 or 14 tev will thus clearly help to improve on the determination of the gluon pdf in the large-@xmath3 regime .    at low @xmath1 ,",
    "corresponding to @xmath3-values of 0.01 to 0.1 , the situation is quite different .",
    "the quark - gluon process still dominates , but the gluon pdf is quite well determined here through the evolution with errors below 10% at the scale @xmath15 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] ) . at the same time , the up- and down - quark pdfs are still strongly influenced by the well - constrained valence contribution .",
    "in contrast , the uncertainty induced by the unphysical scales persists at the level of 10% and represents thus the dominant source of theoretical uncertainty .",
    "taken together , these observations leave little room for improvement of the gluon pdf through electroweak boson production at small transverse momenta .",
    "since the rapidity of the produced vector boson enters exponentially in the expressions for the partonic momentum fractions @xmath76 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] ) , it is clear that moving away from central to forward rapidity creates a more asymmetric situation where the partons of one incoming proton are probed at much larger , those of the other proton at much smaller values of @xmath3 .",
    "this is reflected in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] , where we show cross section ratios obtained with different pdfs to those obtained with ct10 for the production of electroweak bosons with rapidities of @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "these rapidities are still covered by the cms and atlas electromagnetic endcap calorimeters , while muons are only detected up to @xmath48 and 2.5 , respectively . as expected , the pdf uncertainties in the forward region are much larger and reach easily a factor of two . for the reasons mentioned above , the mstw08 uncertainty band is much smaller than the ct10 band , but has a very different shape , while the nnpdf2.1 band widens at the same @xmath1-values as the ct10 band , but can even lead to negative cross sections .",
    "the envelope of all error bands is thus even larger than the error band of ct10 alone .",
    "this demonstrates the potential of corresponding measurements to pin down the gluon pdfs , depending on the transverse momenta that can be reached there .    as a final point , it is also interesting to compare in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] in more detail our theoretical predictions to the experimental data from cms @xcite ( top ) and atlas @xcite ( bottom ) on @xmath0- and @xmath7-boson production in the low-@xmath1 regime , emphasized in this figure by the logarithmic @xmath3-axis .",
    "the reason is that in this region the theoretical prediction is also influenced by the parameters @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 of the non - perturbative function @xmath81 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] ) , which had been fitted only to tevatron run-1 data on @xmath0-boson production , but not yet to lhc data @xcite . as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] , this fit allows to describe also the normalized lhc data perfectly well , so that a newer fit does not seem necessary or lead to much improvement at this point .",
    "this may , however , change once absolute cross sections become available .",
    "in conclusion , we have in this paper investigated a possibility to better constrain the parton densities in the proton at large momentum fractions .",
    "these parton densities are of fundamental importance not only for our description of hadronic and nuclear structure , but also for reliable predictions for new heavy particle searches at colliders .    after establishing the current status of uncertainty from the ct10 , mstw08 and nnpdf2.1 parametrizations , we have computed perturbative and resummed cross sections for electroweak vector boson production at the lhc , finding good agreement with published cms and atlas data for @xmath0 and @xmath7 bosons at @xmath2 tev up to @xmath1 values of 600 and 300 gev , respectively .",
    "we found that at transverse momenta beyond about 20 gev , they were dominated by the qcd `` compton '' process , inducing a large sensitivity of the cross sections on the gluon pdfs .",
    "we have shown that with the luminosities reached in the 8 tev and future 14 tev runs , transverse momenta in the tev range should be measurable , thus providing access to the gluon pdf at large values of @xmath3 , where it is currently very badly constrained .",
    "the theoretical scale uncertainty has been shown to stay sufficiently small there .    at smaller transverse momenta",
    ", little improvement can be made on the determination of gluon and quark pdfs through the proposed process .",
    "however , the uncertainties coming from the resummation calculation and in particular its non - perturbative component have been shown to be under control , as new lhc data at @xmath2 tev can be described perfectly well with a fit made only to tevatron run-1 data on @xmath0-boson production .",
    "we therefore hope that the atlas and cms collaborations will soon make available analyses of electroweak boson production at large transverse momenta , so that they can be used in future global analyses of the parton distribution functions in the proton .",

    "<S> we demonstrate that this process is dominated by quark - gluon scattering , that theoretical predictions can be reliably made on the basis of next - to - leading order perturbation theory and its resummation , and that these data should thus be used in global fits . </S>",
