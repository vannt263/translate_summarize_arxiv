    "although thousands of supernovae ( sne ) have been discovered to date , only several dozen have been detected at either or radio wavelengths ( designated xsne or rsne , respectively ) .",
    "many of these xsne and rsne were originally detected simply as variable or radio sources , and only verified as true sne after careful examination of archival optical data or through optical follow - up ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this particular path to discovery has meant that only a handful of these sources have been well - studied during the first several hundred days , a period which is critical for identifying and characterizing the true nature of the sne .",
    "such sne typically turn out to be core - collapse sne of either type ibc , which have been associated with long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , or type  ii , whereby the intense and/or radio emission is thought to stem from the interaction between the expanding shock and a dense progenitor wind .",
    "when well - sampled , the additional multi - wavelength constraints from xsne and rsne can provide physical insights into the late evolutionary stages of massive stars that are otherwise impossible to obtain .",
    "for instance , while robust constraints on the overall time - averaged mass - loss in various phases of stellar evolution exist , there has been a long - standing debate over the number and sequence of various evolutionary stages for massive stars , and relatively few observational constraints on the actual evolution of mass - loss within many particular stages ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "because the sn blast wave travels orders of magnitude faster than the stellar wind , studying the interaction between the blast wave and the progenitor stellar wind allows us to probe tens of thousands of years of evolution in a matter of decades .",
    "sne progenitors are considered to provide the bulk of all processed stellar material additionally , and thus the characterization of these sources can likewise help further our understanding of overall galactic chemical enrichment .    here",

    "in particular , it demonstrated a factor of @xmath530 increase in flux between , a @xmath610  kev thermal spectrum with a strong , blended fe emission - line component at 6.85  kev , and spatial coincidence with a strong radio and h@xmath7-emitting point source .",
    "the proximity of this sn affords us a rare opportunity to study in detail a type  ii sn which is strongly interacting with its circumstellar medium .",

    "our analyses focus only on the spectrum from the first night , as the observations on the subsequent two nights suffer from significantly worse seeing ( @xmath01520 ) such that the co - addition of these frames failed to improve the signal - to - noise of the final spectrum .",

    "interior to the shell is the low density shocked and unshocked wind , for which we only have upper limits .",
    "exterior to the shell is the unshocked ambient medium , presumably also a wind , which we verify from our free - free absorption .",
    "if true , this picture again indicates that the stellar parameters changed significantly just a few years to a few thousand years before the death of the star , and that this region was formed by wind - wind interaction .",
    "although the shell is thin , it is extremely dense , and the shock colliding with this region could be slowed dramatically , and lead to an increase in radio and x - ray emission , as is observed .",

    "radio emission was again detected from the supernova after @xmath13  yr in quiescence , at first rising in a dramatic fashion for several hundred days and increasing more or less monotonically thereafter ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sn1996cr - lc ] ) . unlike the early absorption in ,",
    "however , the observed spectral index of has remained relatively constant between @xmath321 to @xmath322 , indicating unabsorbed synchrotron emission at all times during this re - emergence @xcite .",
    "the steady rise in is also much steeper than in and @xmath152 times fainter , indicating a markedly different csm - density distribution , and perhaps sharper density contrasts .",
    "the constant monitoring at radio , optical , and x - ray wavelengths has illuminated the density structure surrounding and directly confirmed multiple evolutionary stages of mass loss @xcite .",

    "clearly the csm distribution around appears to be much denser and more compact than , in addition to potentially showing a pile - up of material around @xmath323  cm .",
    "we note that more modest structure in the csm density , perhaps from the wind - wind interaction of multiple evolutionary stages or inhomogeneities within a particular stage , has been observed in many well - sampled rsne light curves now , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and demonstrates that perturbations from @xmath306 are probably commonplace . with finer sampling in the future",
    ", we should be able to place stronger constraints on the outlying density structure in .",
    "we turn next to the x - ray light curve of .",
    "the circinus galaxy was observed with a variety of instruments as shown in fig .",

    ", we find that exhibits strong , atypical temporal evolution .",
    "unlike most sne , is not detected at early times despite relatively frequent and sensitive observations . since thermal x - ray emission effectively traces the density of the csm , these early upper limits , especially when compared to the detections later on ,",
    "again indicate the presence of either strong early absorption ( @xmath324  @xmath13 ) or a low - density cavity immediately surrounding the progenitor .",
    "our radio constraints suggest in fact that both are present and likely to affect the x - ray emission : the mass associated with the ff absorption is already marginally enough to obscure an extrapolation of the detected x - ray slope , while the lower density implied by the radio luminosity jump would also result in decreased early x - ray emission . when finally detected on 2000 - 01 - 16 , the and fluxes are best - fitted as @xmath325 @xmath326 and @xmath327 , respectively .",
    "the slopes are consistent with each other to within the errors , suggesting that any apparent emerging soft component is marginal and that the detected portion of the rise is likely to be optically thin .",
    "this strong , continued rise is in stark contrast to the evolution of nearly all other sne detected to date , which are theoretically expected to decline as @xmath325  @xmath328@xmath329 ( e.g. , cf94 ) and observationally follow suit albeit with more scatter ( e.g. , see fig . 2 of * ?",
    "sustained increases in the have only been observed for @xcite , @xcite , and perhaps marginally for ( based upon a single early upper limit ; * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the forward and reverse shocks at a particular radius @xmath290 is given by    @xmath330    where the index @xmath331 refers to values for either the forward or reverse shock and @xmath332 is the temperature - dependent cooling rate @xcite .",
    "the detection of strong he - like fe and si emission lines in the x - ray spectra @xcite suggests the presence of heavy elements in the x - ray emitting material , and therefore that the x - ray emission stems from the shocked ejecta material found behind the reverse shock .",
    "because the progenitor csm distribution likely includes the presence of pre - existing shocks and density discontinuities associated with the wind - blown bubble ( see @xmath8[radio_ltcrv ] ) , the interaction of the sn blast wave with this medium is complex . due to the presence of various discontinuities , the standard model ( e.g *",
    "* ; cf94 ) of the interaction of a sn blast wave with a power - law ambient density medium is not applicable , and we must rely on detailed hydrodynamical models to infer the specific mass - loss properties of the progenitor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . furthermore the csm may be at least partially photoionized , as is thought to be the case for ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "as shown in the previous section for a wind - blown bubble , even if the progenitor star had a constant wind mass - loss rate and velocity ( which is not likely ) , the structure of the csm can vary substantially with radius .",
    "thus we can not assume that the csm density directly translates into the wind parameters .",
    "nonetheless , we can make some qualitative arguments based on equation  [ eq : lx ] .    between days 18004400 , we find that the intrinsic x - ray luminosity scales almost linearly with time",
    ". the radius over this time period should increase by a factor of @xmath01.6 , depending on the exact nature of the ejecta density profile and the csm .",
    "the width of the emitting region can be approximated to be about 0.1 times the radius ( e.g. , cf94 ) , resulting in an overall volume change by a factor of @xmath2975 . from the x - ray spectrum",
    ", we do not see any significant changes in the temperature or absorption , indicating that @xmath333 remains approximately constant .",
    "if the x - ray emission was arising in the shocked ambient medium , the density in equation  [ eq : lx ] must decrease by a factor of @xmath02.2 , or equivalently be @xmath334 to produce the observed dependence .",
    "this is significantly different from either a constant density or the @xmath335 dependence expected for a stellar wind with constant parameters .",
    "furthermore , for a density profile decreasing as @xmath336 the velocity would be expected to decrease with time , and therefore the temperature ( which is proportional to @xmath337 ) would drop accordingly .",
    "the fact that this is not seen makes it unlikely that the x - ray emission is arising from the shocked wind ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sn_diagram ] ) .",
    "we instead contend that the emission is arising from shocked ejecta behind ( in a lagrangian sense ) the reverse shock .",
    "this scenario is strengthened by the presence of heavy element emission lines in the x - ray spectrum ( cf .",
    "fig .  6 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since such elements are far more likely to reside in the processed ejecta than in the progenitor s stellar wind .",
    "if the sn ejecta did collide with a dense shell of csm from a pre - existing wind - blown bubble , then the forward shock would advance quite slowly , and the bulk of the x - ray emission would arise from the reverse - shocked material",
    ". the post - shock temperature just behind the reverse shock could be quite high ( @xmath2@xmath338  k ) if the density were low  technically the density could drop to zero for expansion in a constant - density medium . the electron temperature , however , might be an order of magnitude lower if the electrons and ions have not yet reached equilibrium .",
    "the temperature would not change appreciably over this period , consistent with our observational constraints .",
    "the velocity of @xmath03400  km  s@xmath21 inferred from the x - ray temperature in this case would refer to the electron temperature in the reverse shock , and thus the actual shock velocity , as traced by the ion temperature , could be considerably higher .",
    "note that a similar linearly increasing light curve profile was found for the hard x - ray emission from sn1987a @xcite .",
    "@xcite has carried out numerical simulations that suggest that this emission arises from the reverse shocked ejecta , as had been postulated by @xcite .",
    "one puzzle which remains , though , is how the strong the h@xmath7 and oxygen emission - line luminosities are powered .",
    "this discrepancy could be reconciled if there were holes in the cds , such that a small fraction of the x - ray emission could escape while the rest went into exciting the strong optical line emission .",
    "we can again gain some further insight by comparing to other sne . as stated above , has the most similarities .",
    "like , was undetected at x - ray wavelengths when it first went off , thereby excluding an explosion directly into a slow , dense wind that is characteristic of a red supergiant .",
    "notably , was detected 130 days after explosion @xcite , although the x - ray emission here was attributed solely to radioactivity and appeared to rise and fall over the following year .",
    "after this brief period , the x - ray emission went undetected for another @xmath0  3  yrs before resurfacing above the noise @xcite . since this time",
    ", the x - ray emission has continued to rise as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sn1996cr - lc ] , with its light curve well - modeled by a broken power law @xcite .",
    "the reappearance of the emission at about 3 years was postulated as due to the interaction of the sn blast wave with a region of ionized wind material from the progenitor @xcite .",
    "they suggested that this region is material photoionized from the dense circumstellar shell that surrounds , formed as a result of the interaction of the progenitor blue supergiant wind with a pre - existing red supergiant wind .",
    "although the evolution of the star may be different , a physical scenario broadly like that of , with a region formed by mass - loss from a progenitor star , certainly seems plausible for , although the contrasting light - curve slopes , luminosities , and radial distances clearly highlight the different csm density structure .",
    "the only other sn to exhibit a rise at x - ray wavelengths is , a peculiar typeib .",
    "the light curve of has been ascribed to the interaction of the blast wave with a dense shell of material left over from an lbv - like outburst of the sn progenitor @xmath12 years prior to the explosion @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectrum for , moreover , is modeled by a hot thermal plasma ( @xmath128  kev ) similar to the early phase of @xcite but substantially hotter than ( @xmath339  kev with an emerging @xmath340  kev component ) , and implies that the conditions within the x - ray - emitting region are somewhat different .",
    "the hotter temperature could indicate a higher shock velocity , or a larger level of equilibration between the electrons and ions .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of is additionally absorbed below @xmath12  kev .",
    "while some fraction of the substantial non - galactic column density could be due to self - absorption , we consider this to be minimal given that other point sources in the circinus galaxy have similar derived column densities @xcite .",
    "the rapid evolution we see here for has been noted in a few other objects , such as @xcite and @xcite . such an evolution has also been invoked to explain the enormous energy output from @xcite , although the lack of obvious csm - interaction measures at x - ray , h@xmath7 , and radio wavelengths here implies that perhaps something more extreme is going on ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , for many of the older , classic x - ray emitting sne such as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , early - time behavior of the x - ray emission remains completely unknown and thus the frequency and duration of sudden evolutionary changes in sne progenitors is still an open question .",
    "the x - ray evolution of may allow us to explain the relatively flat late - time x - ray light curves for objects like and , for instance .",
    "we have confirmed as one of the nearest , and subsequently x - ray and radio - brightest , sne to date .",
    "archival optical imaging data have constrained the explosion date to within @xmath01  yr prior to 1996 - 03 - 16 , while a new vlt spectrum has identified it as a type  iin sn .",
    "the multi - wavelength constraints detailed above point to a rich progenitor history .",
    "as is the case for most type  iin sne , appears to have originated from a massive star that shed its outer layers at some late evolutionary stage , which now act as the target for the outgoing sn shock .",
    "the optical light curve hints at a mild re - brightening at late times , possibly driven by line emission , or by x - ray photons being downscattered and being emitted as optical photons . from the recent optical spectrum , the strong narrow h emission points to a significant accumulation of mass in the csm prior to the sn .",
    "we are additionally able to resolve the complex o emission into a number of distinct high - velocity components with fwhm@xmath120003000  km  s@xmath21 .",
    "the origin of such distinct o complexes remains somewhat unclear , perhaps arising from one or more of the following : structural asymmetries , differential absorption , or multiple concentric shocks .",
    "the and radio emission allow us to quantify the csm density , tracing out two apparently distinct regions , which can not be reconciled with a single constant - wind model . from the radio and x - ray upper limits , we infer that the inner region ( @xmath341  cm ) is likely quite sparse .",
    "the outer region [ @xmath342@xmath343  cm ] , as traced by the early radio absorption , radio luminosity jump , and x - ray emission , is not well constrained , and is likely associated with the interaction region between two distinct progenitor winds , which culminates in a thin , dense wind - swept shell .",
    "this second region appears relatively dense ( @xmath344  @xmath249 ) , potentially consistent with a slow - velocity wr - like wind , although the csm density profile traced by the radio absorption ( @xmath345 ) naively seems at odds with the implied csm density profiles from the radio and x - ray luminosities ( @xmath346constant or @xmath336 , respectively ) .",
    "a more detailed understanding of the csm awaits sophisticated hydrodynamical models .",
    "the most plausible explanation is one where the progenitor changed evolutionary states just prior to explosion , likely transitioning from a wr - like wind to an even faster , less dense wind , resulting in portions of the previous csm being swept - up to form a wind - blown cavity surrounded by a dense shell .",
    "such a scenario has been recently proposed for the peculiar @xcite .",
    "the radio and x - ray emission are constant or still rising , demonstrating that the blast wave is still making its way through the dense , swept - up shell at the edge of the cavity .",
    "the collision of the blast wave with the shell would result in a transmitted shock expanding into the shell , and a reflected shock expanding back into the sn ejecta .",
    "this reflected shock should be distinguished initially from the reverse shock of the sn expanding into the ejecta , although it will eventually overtake the reverse shock .",
    "the overall effect could be one of several shocks and rarefaction waves travelling back and forth through the ejecta .",
    "a spectrum would reveal several different velocity structures , perhaps as we observe in the o lines .",
    "the reason why it is seen mainly in o is unclear , but it could indicate that this is an o - rich remnant , similar to casa for example ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . or perhaps it is just that the reverse shock has not penetrated very far into the ejecta , so that only the o - rich layers have been shocked .",
    "we note that if the shock is indeed progressing into shell of constant density , then the resulting density gradients would not lead to the formation of a cds at all ( e.g. , see fig .",
    "14 of * ? ? ?",
    "if so , then the observed o velocity components may instead arise from a disk or ring prehaps similar to sn1987a .",
    "once the blast wave makes its way through the dense shell , it will emerge from the other side , presumably as a weak shock .",
    "this should encounter a relatively pristine wind and start to decline in both the radio and x - ray bands .",
    "further regular monitoring of should reveal this .",
    "once this happens , we will be able to strengthen many of our current constraints and assumptions .",
    "we have compared to the late - time behavior of , which is the only other sn with a documented dramatic increase at and radio wavelengths",
    ". is likely propagating through its csm in a manner similar to expanding into its region and circumstellar ring ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the and radio luminosities of , however , are several orders of magnitude brighter and comparable to typical type  iin sne such as and .",
    "this is presumably because the swept - up csm is more compact , and perhaps , unlike , there is no intervening high - density material encountered which slows down the ejecta until they reach a dense shell , so the density jump is higher and subsequently more dramatic . as we follow over the next few decades , we anticipate that it will transition into an evolution similar to other sne .",
    "it is intriguing to think that might represent a sort of `` bridge '' object between the extremes of and these more luminous type  ii sne .",
    "although plagued by small number statistics , the fact that two ( although perhaps more if we count and ) of the @xmath1510 closest sne to have exploded in the past four decades show evidence for wind - blown bubbles implies that the phenomenon is common , and may indicate that current sne searches are somehow biased against them at larger distances .",
    "systematic constraints exist only for type  ibc sne @xcite , where late - time radio observations indicate that only @xmath12% of initially undetected targets show late - time detections , while @xmath140% of detections exhibit abrupt light - curve variations .",
    "the large mass associated with the pre - sn csm surrounding could have been the result of explosive mass loss thousands of years before the sn explosion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , qualitatively similar to @xcite , although the limited and radio data point to a relatively smooth density profile , which implies a more gradual process was at work .",
    "numerous other sne including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite all show signs of dense , enriched csm likely produced by giant mass - loss events just prior to their sne , implying that this form of mass - loss is relatively common .",
    "lbvs have often been invoked to account for such episodes of extreme mass - loss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed a giant outburst was seen in the case of just 2 years prior to core - collapse @xcite .",
    "again it is unclear whether the explosive nature of lbvs can be reconciled with the relatively smooth mass - loss / density gradients observed for .",
    "our analyses clearly demonstrate that is a unique and compelling target . its proximity and flux enable a wealth of observations that would be otherwise impractical for typical sne .",
    "we have reported on initial findings of a vlbi campaign underway to resolve spatially at several radio wavelengths , eventually enabling studies of its morphology and temporal expansion .",
    "this will provide a more coherent picture , allowing us to set strong limits on the expansion velocity from the resolved size and potentially confirm the implied asymmetries we infer from the optical spectrum .",
    "follow - up _ hst _ imaging will provide constraints on any potential light echoes in the vicinity of , possibly allowing refined estimates of its explosion date , distance , and outlying csm structure . likewise , follow - up observations will hopefully elucidate the nature of the strong continued rise in the band and better constrain properties of the reverse shock region . notably , is bright enough to be efficiently monitored using the _ chandra _ hetgs , enabling high - resolution studies of its numerous emission lines and their potential evolution ; an in - depth discussion of the current spectral constraints , including a composite _ chandra _ hetgs spectrum from the data presented here , are forthcoming ( f. bauer et al .",

    "infrared imaging and spectroscopy will help address the potential for dust formation ; notably sne are thought to contribute strongly to the overall dust content of galaxies .",
