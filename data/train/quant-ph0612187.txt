    "it is true that the quantum zeno effect describes the situation in which the decay of a particle can be prevented by observations on a sufficiently short time scale .",
    "however , the quantum zeno effect is much more general , since it describes the situation in which the time evolution of _ any _ quantum system can be slowed by sufficiently frequent `` observations . ''",
    "the references to observations and to wavefunction collapse tend to raise unnecessary questions related to the interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "actually , all that is required is that some interaction with an external system disturb the unitary evolution of the quantum system in a way that is effectively like a projection operator .",

    "applied to the case of an unstable particle whose trajectory is observed in a bubble chamber or film emulsion , this result seemed to imply that such a particle would not decay , in contradiction to experiment . in this case , the resolution to the apparent paradox lies in the fact that the interactions between the particle and its environment that lead to the observed track are not sufficiently frequent to modify the particle s lifetime .",

    ", the inhibition of the transition is accompanied by the _ absence _ of laser - induced fluorescence .",
    "recently , the quantum zeno effect was observed for an unstable quantum system by fischer _ et al _ @xcite . the quantum zeno effect for induced transitions and for unstable systems",

    "as can be seen by the history of citations ( fig .",
    "[ citesfig ] ) , the publication of the ihbw experiment @xcite generated considerable interest . initially , some of the responses were critical in one way or another . some ( e. g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) objected to the use of the term `` wavefunction collapse '' in describing the experiment .",
    "the authors responded that the concept of wavefunction collapse was not essential , and that any interpretation of quantum mechanics that yielded the same prediction of the experimental results should be regarded as valid @xcite .",
    "some objected to the fact that photons were not actually observed during the intermediate `` measurements , '' in the sense of having the scattered photons registered by a detector , so that the experiment did not actually demonstrate the quantum zeno effect @xcite .",
    "however , the results are predicted to be the same whether or not the intermediate measurements are made .",
    "it is enough that the measurements _ could _ have been made .",
    "as long as the laser interactions act effectively as projection operators , so that the algebra of eqs .",
    "( [ quadratic])([survival_n ] ) is followed , the experiment should be regarded as a demonstration of the quantum zeno effect .",
    "it should be noted that none of the criticisms were directed at the execution of the experiment itself , only at the interpretation . for the most part , the citations to ref .",
    "@xcite simply accept it as a demonstration of the quantum zeno effect .",
    "in fact , it is cited in quantum mechanics textbooks @xcite and popular science books @xcite .",
    "while misra and sudarshan originally used the term `` quantum zeno paradox , '' as did peres @xcite and others , the more recent work usually uses the term `` quantum zeno effect , '' perhaps because the effect no longer seems paradoxical .",
    "some authors distinguish between the quantum zeno _ paradox _ and the quantum zeno _ effect _ , but they do so in differing ways .",
    "pascazio and namiki @xcite call the situation in which the frequency of measurements is finite and the evolution is slowed the quantum zeno _ effect , _ and the limiting case in which the frequency of measurements is infinite and the evolution is frozen the quantum zeno _",
    "paradox_. block and berman @xcite call the inhibition of spontaneous decay the quantum zeno _ paradox _ and the inhibition of induced transitions ( as in the ihbw experiment ) the quantum zeno _ effect_. in ref .",
    "@xcite , home and whitaker reserve the term quantum zeno _ paradox _ for a negative - result experiment involving observations with a macroscopic apparatus .",
    "this definition of the quantum zeno paradox seems to exclude most , if not all , feasible experiments . in this context , the ihbw experiment is not regarded as an example of the quantum zeno paradox because a local interaction is present between the laser field and the atoms , and also because the electromagnetic field , containing zero or a few scattered photons , is not regarded as a macroscopic observation apparatus .",
    "they regard the type of experiments where the time evolution of a quantum system is affected by a direct interaction , for example with an external field , as examples of the quantum zeno _",
    "effect_. however , in a later publication @xcite the same authors treat the terms quantum zeno _ paradox _ and quantum zeno _ effect _ as synonymous and restrict both to nonlocal negative - result experiments involving a macroscopic observation apparatus . experiments that do not meet these criteria would not be examples of _ either _ the quantum zeno paradox _ or _ the quantum zeno effect , according to their later definition .",
    "several variations on the general theme of quantum zeno effects have been described .",
    "soon after the ihbw experiment was carried out , peres and ron @xcite showed that a partial quantum zeno effect results if the measurements are too weak to completely destroy the coherence of the state of the measured system .",
    "a modification of the ihbw experiment was proposed in which the measurement laser pulses are weakened .",
    "et al _ @xcite showed that a related effect , damped oscillations of the state populations , can occur if the duration of the experiment is extended , while weak measurements are made .    some , including kofman and kurizki @xcite and facchi _ et al _ @xcite have shown that the decay of an unstable quantum system can be accelerated by frequent observations",
    "this is called the quantum anti - zeno effect or the inverse quantum zeno effect . as is the case for the quantum zeno effect",
    ", the observations must take place before the decay becomes exponential . unlike the quantum zeno effect , which follows from rather general arguments , e. g. eqs .",
    "( [ quadratic])([survival_n ] ) , the possibility of observing a quantum anti - zeno effect depends on the details of the system .",
    "the experiment of fischer _",
    "et al _ @xcite demonstrated the quantum anti - zeno effect as well as the quantum zeno effect .",
    "an interesting generalization of the quantum zeno effect is the concept of quantum zeno dynamics @xcite .",
    "frequent measurements can confine the evolution of a quantum system to a subspace of the hilbert space rather than simply to the initial state . compared to the ordinary quantum zeno effect",
    ", the difference is that the measurements distinguish not between the initial _ state _ and all other states but between a _",
    "subspace _ and the rest of the hilbert space .",
    "this form of quantum zeno effect may find application in quantum information processing .",
    "as already noted , the recent increase in the rate of citations to the articles of misra and sudarshan @xcite and ihbw @xcite is partially related to increased interest in quantum information processing . in this context",
    ", there have been various proposals to use the quantum zeno effect to preserve quantum systems from decoherence .",
    "beige _ et al _ @xcite have proposed an arrangement of atoms inside an optical cavity capable of carrying out quantum logic operations with low error rates within a decoherence - free subspace of the hilbert space .",
    "states outside the decoherence - free subspace are coupled strongly to the environment .",
    "the quantum zeno effect then leads to effective confinement of the system to the decoherence - free subspace , which is an example of a quantum zeno subspace .",
    "franson _ et al _ @xcite have proposed use of the quantum zeno effect to suppress errors in a linear optics implementation of quantum computation . in this implementation , the presence of two photons in the same mode indicates an error .",
    "the presence of a strong two - photon absorber in an optical fiber takes the role of the `` observer '' and suppresses the errors .",
    "other proposed applications of the quantum zeno effect to error prevention in quantum computation are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "quantum `` bang - bang '' control and related dynamical decoupling techniques @xcite utilize frequent , pulsed interactions to effectively prevent decoherence of a quantum system by confining the dynamics to a subspace .",
    "this is not exactly the quantum zeno effect , since the interactions are unitary , but the results are mathematically similar to those for the quantum zeno effect .",
    "dhar _ et al _ @xcite have discussed the `` super - zeno effect , '' which preserves a state ( or more generally , keeps a quantum system within a subspace of the hilbert space ) with a set of pulsed interactions unequally spaced in time .",
    "the timing of these interactions can be arranged so as to be more efficient than can be done with the same number of equally spaced interactions ( ordinary quantum zeno effect ) .",
    "also , it should be noted that the pulsed interactions are unitary kicks , as in the so - called `` bang - bang control '' @xcite , and not observations in the usual sense .",
    "the 1977 publication of misra and sudarshan stimulated a great deal of theoretical and experimental work that has enhanced our understanding of the time development of quantum systems , such as the short - time nonexponential decay of unstable quantum systems .",
    "the results of the ihbw experiment , published in 1990 , was a clear confirmation of the existence of the quantum zeno effect for the case of the inhibition of an induced transition .",
    "interest in the quantum zeno effect continues to be high , partially due to the possibility of practical applications in quantum information processing ."
