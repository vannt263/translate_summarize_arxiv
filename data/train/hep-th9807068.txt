    "the inflation model is widely accepted as the standard cosmological model which describes the universe from @xmath1 seconds after its creation . however , standard cosmology presents many unresolved problems , including the origin of large scale structure of the universe , the origin of density fluctuations , which initiate galaxy formation , and the mechanism for baryon asymmetry , which leads to the production of more matter than antimatter",
    ". it has been conjectured that many of these problems can be resolved by incorporating topological defects with inflation @xcite .",
    "the most popular defect model exploits the presence of cosmic strings , which are predicted by modern grand unified theories ( guts ) to have formed as the early universe passed through successive phase transitions @xcite .    around @xmath2 seconds after the big bang",
    ", the universe passed through a phase transition corresponding to symmetry breaking of the gut force to distinct strong and electroweak forces . at this time",
    "an extensive gut cosmic string network is believed to have formed @xcite .",
    "the subsequent evolution of this network introduces density fluctuations into an otherwise homogeneous universe , which are conjectured to have lead to large scale structure in the observable universe @xcite .",
    "however , cosmic strings are not topologically stable in simple non - abelian models , and therefore are not an inevitable prediction of all gut models .",
    "cosmic strings are only stable in models which involve discrete symmetry breaking @xcite ( e.g. , @xmath3 ) , or when a @xmath4 generator is gauged to form semi - local strings @xcite .",
    "although cosmic strings provide a mechanism for introducing fluctuations , they also pose significant problems for cosmology .",
    "many gut models predict that a cosmic string has an internal structure , which allows it to become superconducting @xcite .",
    "superconducting cosmic string loops can stabilize to vortons @xcite , which would interfere with primordial nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "in addition to predicting the existence of cosmic strings , guts also predict large numbers of magnetic monopoles @xcite which are not observed @xcite .",
    "this is often referred to as the monopole problem . however , in models of @xmath5 symmetry breaking , sphalerons form instead of monopoles @xcite .",
    "sphalerons are of interest since they are capable of baryon and lepton number violating processes @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that it is possible to construct a cosmologically significant defect in @xmath0 models , that behaves locally like a string , but is a topologically stable network texture .",
    "the local stability is a consequence of the interactions between adjacent string defects .",
    "since this new defect is stabilized by the surrounding string network , we introduce the name homilia string to differentiate it from cosmic strings .",
    "sphalerons are identified with the intersection of two homilia strings , and the separation of the strings results in the annihilation of the sphaleron .",
    "furthermore , electroweak homilia string loops can not stabilize as bosonic or fermonic vortons , which circumvents the adverse cosmological problems of stable loops .",
    "homilia strings can be generalized to @xmath6 models of symmetry breaking .",

    "both nonsymmetric and cosmic strings are described by the homotopy group @xmath7 ( i.e. , a non - contractible @xmath8 circle ) . however , nonsymmetric strings @xcite differ from cosmic strings since they do not constitute a line of false vacuum . within the core of a nonsymmetric string the higgs field rotates in isospin space to reconcile an undefined phase . usually string defects in non - abelian models",

    "this implies that the non - simply connected region can be continuously deformed into a simply connected region , removing the topological defect .",

    "the stability of homilia strings is related to the topology of the string network , not to the topology of an individual string . since a homilia string network can not be deformed continuously to the vacuum , it is topologically stable even in non - abelian models",

    "the dots were then displayed on a three - dimensional plot . to verify that these objects are homilia strings we use the vortex solution and plots of the field magnitude , @xmath38 ; this shows deviations from the vacuum state that are characteristic of homilia strings .",

    "for an arbitrary direction there will be a @xmath45-string located near the @xmath39-string at some distance @xmath63 , whence @xmath65 is non - zero . because @xmath65 is non - zero at a distance @xmath63 from the @xmath39-string for all @xmath64 , the homilia @xmath39-string is a stable defect which can not unwind .",

    "however , the overscreening depends on the non - trivial phase winding of the two cosmic strings being described by the same generator ( i.e. , the phase fields are the same ) .",

    "consequently , the force between homilia strings of different types is always repulsive .    equation ( [ eq - cforce ] ) gives the angular force on a @xmath39-string segment due to an adjacent segment of @xmath45-string , i.e. , @xmath138 for @xmath139 , the two string segments are superposed to form a point of false vacuum , @xmath140 ( see sec .",

    "homilia strings of the same type interact rapidly , as they are unstable and locally unwind ( i.e. , @xmath146 between two strings ) .",

    "gut homilia strings retain the same useful cosmological properties as cosmic strings gut models which do not predict the formation of stable cosmic string defects can nevertheless accommodate large scale structure and density fluctuations induced by gut homilia strings .",
    "since homilia strings have a mass per unit length , cylindrical symmetry and are lorentz invariant along the string length , they will also exhibit a conical spacetime similar to cosmic strings @xcite .",

    ", an homilia string network is prevented from dominating the energy density of the universe . since homilia strings only intercommute with strings of the same type ( sec .",

    "equation ( [ eq - lensol ] ) indicates that the number density of a network of homilia strings will be greater than the corresponding value for a cosmic string network .",
    "the evolution of an homilia string network leaves characteristic fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , providing an experimental test for homilia strings .",
    "since homilia strings possess a conical metric , gut homilia strings will be capable of inducing non - gaussian fluctuations in the cmb in the same manner as cosmic strings @xcite .",

    "measurements of the anisotropy angular power spectrum may provide a means of differentiating fluctuations due to homilia strings from those induced by cosmic strings .",
    "however , to quantify the magnitude of these fluctuations will require a detailed simulation of an homilia string network .",

    "individual homilia strings are stabilized via their boundary conditions with adjacent defects .",
    "the topological stability of these string defects is a consequence of the surrounding homilia string network , which can be considered to be a texture .",
    "although some aspects of homilia string dynamics are similar to @xmath4 cosmic strings , homilia strings have additional properties which may have important consequences for cosmology . sphalerons in @xmath0 are identified with the intersection of two homilia strings . due to repulsive forces , homilia strings separate and induce sphaleron decay .",
