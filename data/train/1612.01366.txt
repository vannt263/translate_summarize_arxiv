    "low - mass dwarfs ( m @xmath5 0.6 m@xmath6 ) account for almost three quarters of the galactic stellar population , belong to various subsystems , and exhibit a considerable variety in the context of kinematics and physical parameters .",
    "evidence of magnetic activity has been found in the outer shells of late - type dwarfs : flare and spot activity .",
    "these factors have determined a considerable interest in investigating low - mass stars in the last decade .",
    "the luminosities of the stars under consideration are generally lower than the solar one by hundreds or thousands of times .",
    "therefore , our knowledge about these objects is based largely on the results of observations of dwarfs in the immediate solar neighborhood ( d @xmath5 50 pc ) .",
    "attempts to construct and interpret the mass function near the `` stars ",
    "brown dwarfs '' boundary ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) have shown the necessity of refining the fraction of binary and multiple objects among the dwarfs of various subsystems . when constructing present - day models of dwarf stars , researchers pay attention to the correspondence between the theoretical and observed mass  radius and mass  luminosity relations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , knowing accurate masses of dwarf stars plays an important role in testing such models .",
    "these problems motivate the observers to search for binary systems among the dwarf stars , to construct their orbits , and to determine their masses ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "positional observations of the motions of nearby dwarfs may play a significant role in these studies , because they allow astrometric binary stars within several tens of parsecs from the sun to be revealed .",
    "astrometric binaries are separated into a special group by the detection technique .",
    "usually we are dealing with a binary system for which the wobble of one of the components due to gravitational perturbations from the companion can be detected on the basis of astrometric observations .",
    "the second component is unobservable , for example , because of its very low luminosity . occasionally , such objects are called stars with invisible companions . at present",
    ", the stars whose images are not resolved into components , but periodic deviations in the motion of their photocenter are noticeable are often attributed to astrometric binaries .    as a rule",
    ", solar - neighborhood stars are distinguished by large proper motions ( @xmath7 0.1 arcsec@xmath8yr@xmath9 ) .",
    "such stars are being actively investigated within the pulkovo observational program ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "some of the program stars have turned out to exhibit evidence for nonlinearity of their motion over the celestial sphere ( astrometric binary candidates ; see @xcite ) .",
    "the most interesting objects have been selected to be tested for binarity through speckle observations with the bta sao ras telescope , with which binary stars are being continuously observed and great experience has been accumulated ( @xcite ) .",
    "this list includes a total of 12 stars . at present , the image of one of them , j1158 + 4239 ( gj 3697 or 2mass 11585947 + 4239395 , ra = 11@xmath10 58@xmath11 59.93@xmath12 , dec = + 42@xmath3 39@xmath13 38.1@xmath14 at the epoch j2000 ) , has been confidently separated into components , and the astrometric parameters of the pair and the magnitude difference between its components have been estimated .",
    "additional observations of j1158 + 4239 have been performed with a speckle polarimeter at the caucasus mountain observatory ( cmo ) of the sternberg astronomical institute of the moscow state university ( sai msu ) .",
    "the details of these studies are reflected in the subsequent sections of this paper .",
    "the study of the remaining program stars continues .",
    "for many of the binary systems consisting of low - mass stars , the angular separation between the components can be of the order of tenths of an arcsecond .",
    "such binaries appear as single objects during observations with the instruments used for photographic and ccd sky surveys in the last decades . by measuring the coordinate of such stars based on the scans of photographic plates or ccd frames",
    ", we actually determine the position of the binary photocenter for the spectral band specified by the filter being used .",
    "given a dense and long series of observations , a periodicity of the motion can be revealed by standard methods . in most cases , we do not have such series for nearby dwarfs .",
    "nevertheless , given several observations distributed nonuniformly in time , we can attempt to make estimates based on the proper motions . it is easy to see that the mean proper motion of the photocenter can differ significantly from the instantaneous one .",
    "a statistically significant difference between these proper motions compared to the errors of their determination can be revealed under certain conditions .",
    "this may be considered as evidence that the star in question is a binary system .",
    "this idea was applied by @xcite to bright stars from the fk6 catalog . when implementing the pulkovo program of research on stars with large proper motions",
    ", this technique was adapted to reveal astrometric binaries among the low - luminosity stars in the solar neighborhood ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    the quantity f defined as @xmath15 allows the significance of the difference @xmath16 to be estimated ( here , @xmath17 are the corresponding proper motion differences , @xmath18 are the corresponding proper motion errors ) .",
    "at @xmath19 a star may be considered an astrometric binary candidate ( or a @xmath17-binary candidate in wielen s terminology ) .",
    "the present - day astrometric catalogs of stars constructed from ccd observations contain the coordinates for tens or hundreds of millions of stars with an accuracy of 20@xmath20100 mas , depending on the magnitude .",
    "therefore , we decided to determine the proper motions of fast stars based on data from the cmc14 , 2mass , and sdss catalogs .",
    "however , the epoch difference for these catalogs is typically 2@xmath203 years , which is responsible for the low accuracy of the proper motions .",
    "therefore , we performed ccd observations of more than 400 stars with @xmath7 0.3@xmath21yr@xmath9 ) at the pulkovo normal astrograph ( d = 330 mm , f = 3500 mm ) . as a result , we determined the equatorial coordinates and proper motions of these stars at an epoch difference of 5@xmath2010 years with an accuracy of 4@xmath205 mas@xmath8yr@xmath9 in the declination zone 30@xmath2270@xmath3 .",
    "the derived proper motions may be considered with some confidence as `` quasi - instantaneous '' .",
    "the proper motions presented in the lspm catalog were determined at an epoch difference of 40@xmath2050 years and have the status of `` quasi - mean '' ones .",
    "the difference between the quasi - instantaneous and quasi - mean proper motions turned out to be significant for 70 stars .",
    "the data on this were published in @xcite and are accessible in electronic form in the pulkovo astrometric database system   .",
    "the described method of solving the problem has a number of problems .",
    "the stellar coordinates used in deriving the proper motions can be distorted by systematic errors , which are very difficult to reveal and to take into account .",
    "therefore , we decided to make an attempt at studying the motions of fast stars by analyzing the images of sky fields from the dss , 2mass , sdss dr12 , and wise digital surveys .",
    "the systematic errors of the stellar coordinates were investigated for each individual survey . to calculate the proper motions , we formed a unified system of reference stars ( i.e.",
    ", the reference stars were the same in all frames and plate scans ) .",
    "as a result of these studies , the proper motions were determined for 1308 stars in the declination zone 30@xmath2270@xmath3 with a mean accuracy of 4 mas@xmath8yr@xmath9 .",
    "evidence for nonlinearity of the motion over the celestial sphere is observed for 121 stars from this list ( @xcite ) .",
    "all the results of this study are accessible in the vizier   database .",
    "the investigated objects should be qualified as astrometric binary candidates .",
    "further studies are required to confirm their binarity . for 12 stars from the pulkovo program characterized by large f",
    ", we proposed to perform speckle observations with the bta sao ras and cmo sai msu telescopes .",

    "we used a speckle interferometer based on an andor ixon ultra 512@xmath23512-pixel emccd camera .",
    "the field size was 4.5@xmath234.5 arcsec .",
    "the scales were calibrated by recording the interference pattern from a two - hole mask located on the covers of the telescope s prime - focus cabin .",
    "the position was calibrated by measuring the position angles of the orion trapezium components ( @xmath24 ori ) .",
    "we used an interference filter with a central wavelength of 800 nm and a fwhm of 100 nm .    during the observations we recorded several series of 2000 short - exposure speckle images",
    "the exposure time was 20 ms , the total series accumulation time , including the expenditure on the frame reading and recording , was about 3 min .",
    "the data were reduced by a standard method ( balega et al .",

    "the observations of j1158 + 4239 were also performed with the speckle polarimeter ( @xcite )   of the 2.5-m cmo sai msu telescope . in its design ,",
    "the instrument is a camera in which two images corresponding to the horizontal and vertical polarizations are formed .",
    "the effective angular scale of the camera is small enough to provide a proper calculation of the object s spatial spectrum up to the cutoff frequency .",
    "the detector is an andor ixon+897 ccd with electronic amplification .    with this instrument we obtained a series with a length of @xmath259500 frames at a single - frame exposure time of 30 ms ,",

    "the filter was a standard bessel r filter .",
    "note that the transmission curve of this filter has a fairly large fwhm , which leads to an isotropic drop in the contrast of the speckle pattern .",
    "the image blurring due to atmospheric dispersion and beamsplitter dispersion also begins to play a significant role .",
    "both these effects lower the signal - to - noise ratio in the power spectrum but not fatally , and they were taken into account in the reduction .    to estimate the binary parameters , we applied the standard approach of speckle interferometry , i.e. , fitting the averaged power spectrum ( @xcite ) .",

    "3 . the fringes are evidence of the source s binarity .    to estimate the errors in the binary parameters , we divided the entire series into three equal parts and considered separately the images referring to two polarimeter beams .",
    "the parameters were sought separately for each of the six sets ; we provide the means of their values as the final result and the rms deviations are the estimates of their errors .",
    "the binary parameters in the detector s reference frame are as follows : the separation @xmath0 = 14.37 @xmath1 0.07 pixels , the position angle @xmath2 = 172.8@xmath3 @xmath1 0.4@xmath3 , and the contrast @xmath4 = 0.9@xmath11 @xmath1 0.1@xmath11 .",

    "4 ) .    one can not say that the models of low - mass stars are characterized by a high accuracy ( spada et al .",
    "this may explain the fact that the agreement for other colors is poorer than that for the infrared data and is hundredths ( and occasionally tenths ) of a magnitude .",
    "the magnitude differences obtained during speckle observations provide an additional possibility for testing these constructions .",
