    "the interpretation and theoretical description of measurements on quantum systems have been under intense debate since the birth of quantum mechanics  @xcite . in the last three decades",
    "the major role played by environment - induced decoherence in a measurement process has been fully acknowledged thanks to the works of zeh , zurek , and others  ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . a renewal of interest for quantum detection and decoherence came in the last decade with new developments in quantum information .",
    "it is desirable to better understand the relation between quantum and classical information and how one can convert one into another .",
    "moreover , good control over all sources of decoherence is required for quantum information processing . on the experimental side",
    ", measurements can be used either to extract information on quantum states or to monitor quantum systems ( quantum trajectories  @xcite , quantum zeno effect  @xcite ) .",
    "experimental data are now available for the decoherence time in microwave cavities  @xcite , in trapped ions  @xcite , in solid state devices like quantum dots  @xcite and superconducting tunnel junction nanocircuits  @xcite , for fullerene molecules decohered by collisions with a background gas  @xcite , and for beams of electrons decohered by coulomb interaction with a semiconducting plate  @xcite . these and other experiments call for studies of concrete models for quantum measurements .",
    "various models have been investigated so far ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and the interesting statistical physics models of refs .",
    "@xcite ) but a satisfactory treatment of decoherence resulting from the many - body interactions in the measurement apparatus is still lacking .",
    "a measurement on a quantum system consists in letting this system ( called `` object '' in the following ) interact with a measurement apparatus , in such a way that some information about the state of the object is transferred to the apparatus . as already recognized by bohr",
    ", even though the composite ( object and apparatus ) system has to be described by quantum theory , some part of the apparatus ( called the `` pointer '' in the following ) must be capable of classical behavior .",
    "the interaction builds up a one - to - one correspondence between the eigenvalues @xmath0 of the measured observable @xmath1 ( supposed here to have a discrete spectrum ) and macroscopically distinguishable pointer states ( characterized e.g. by sharply defined pointer positions separated by macroscopic distances ) .",
    "in addition to this object - apparatus coupling , the measurement must involve some `` superselection rules '' destroying the coherences between the pointer states  @xcite .",
    "most previous discussions in the literature consider these two processes separately : a first step ( `` premeasurement '' ) exclusively treats the unitary evolution entangling object and pointer . for an object",
    "initially uncorrelated to the apparatus and in a linear superposition @xmath2 of eigenstates of @xmath1 , this entanglement produces a superposition of macroscopically distinguishable object - pointer states @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the pointer state tied up with the eigenvalue @xmath0 ( for simplicity we provisionally assume that this state is pure ) . the `` schrdinger cat '' state @xmath5",
    "is taken as the initial state for a second dynamical process , decoherence , which leads to superselection rules ; there , the quantum correlations between object and apparatus are transformed into classical correlations , as the superposition of object - pointer states is degraded to a statistical mixture of the same states according to @xmath6 .",
    "for such a sequential treatment to make physical sense , the duration of the entanglement process must be short compared with the decoherence time @xmath7 associated with the latter transformation .",
    "however , it is known that @xmath7 is extremely short for macroscopic superpositions .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the more realistic situation where entanglement and decoherence proceed simultaneously .",
    "if the characteristic time for entanglement is larger than @xmath7 , macroscopic superpositions decohere to mixtures faster than entanglement can create them .",
    "the measurement process then yields the final mixture without involving a schrdinger cat state at any previous moment , the object - pointer initial product state being directly transformed as @xmath8 here @xmath2 , @xmath9 , and @xmath4 refer to the object initial state , the pointer initial state , and the pointer state tied up with @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "our model is a three - partite model and consists of the quantum object to be measured , a single `` pointer '' degree of freedom of the apparatus singled out by its strong coupling to the object and by affording a macroscopic range of `` read - out '' values , and a `` bath '' comprising all other degrees of freedom of the apparatus .",
    "a pointer - bath coupling is responsible for decoherence . overcoming limitations of many previous approaches , we ( i )",
    "allow for object - pointer entanglement and decoherence of distinct pointer readouts to proceed simultaneously , ( ii ) cope with initial correlations between pointer and bath by considering them initially in a metastable local thermal equilibrium , and ( iii ) go beyond the markovian treatment of decoherence .",
    "the physical relevance of point ( i ) has been discussed above .",
    "this simultaneity of entanglement and decoherence and the possibility of having decoherence much faster than entanglement have been considered in  @xcite .",
    "let us now comment on ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "most models studied so far ( in particular in  @xcite ) are based on the assumption that the pointer and bath are initially statistically independent .",
    "taking instead the whole apparatus to be initially in a local thermal equilibrium seems more realistic . the markov approximation mentioned in ( iii ) consists in neglecting memory effects for the ( reduced ) object - pointer dynamics .",
    "it assumes the decoherence time @xmath7 to be larger than the bath correlation time , a condition not satisfied in some experiments  @xcite .",
    "since decoherence for macroscopic and even mesoscopic superpositions is faster than bath relaxation  @xcite , this approximation is clearly unjustified if such superpositions arise during the object - pointer evolution .",
    "we shall assume a certain ordering of time scales .",
    "one of these , denoted by @xmath10 , is the characteristic time for the evolution of the measured observable @xmath1 under the hamiltonian of the object .",
    "a second ( classical ) time scale @xmath11 characterizes significant changes in position of the pointer under its proper hamiltonian ( i.e. , in the absence of coupling with the object ) .",
    "the initial temperature @xmath12 of the apparatus sets a time scale @xmath13 , referred to below as the thermal time ( @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant ) .",
    "finally , the object and pointer are put in contact during a time @xmath15 . for a macroscopic pointer ,",
    "the limit @xmath16 seems difficult to avoid .",
    "similarly , the decoherence and object - pointer interaction times @xmath7 and @xmath15 are small compared with @xmath11 . during an ideal measurement , the measured observable @xmath1 may change but weakly under the full ( object + apparatus ) hamiltonian @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath18 for @xmath19 . only under this condition",
    "can an eigenstate of the measured observable @xmath1 be left almost unchanged by the measurement .",
    "one has to require that ( i )  the object - pointer interaction hamiltonian producing the entanglement commutes with @xmath1 ( see  @xcite ) and ( ii )  @xmath10 be much larger than @xmath15 and @xmath7 .",
    "it is thus legitimate to assume @xmath20 as far as we are aware , this separation of time scales in ideal measurements has not been fully exploited in previous works except in ref .",
    "unlike in the latter reference , given ( [ timescales ] ) we shall not need a further hypothesis on the bath correlation time @xmath21 and its relation with @xmath15 and @xmath22 .",
    "a further key input in what follows is the quantum central limit theorem ( qclt )  @xcite which implies gaussian statistics ( wick theorem ) for the bath coupling agent in the pointer - bath interaction .",
    "this will allow us to study a broad class of pointers and baths , following the approach of ref .",
    "the harmonic oscillator bath linearly coupled to the pointer  @xcite is one member of this class , but more general ( non - harmonic ) baths as well as nonlinear couplings in the position @xmath23 of the pointer will be also considered .",
    "it turns out that the decoherence time @xmath7 may be considerably reduced by allowing such non - linear couplings .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model and its different time scales are introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec - model ] .",
    "we discuss the separation of the time scales ( [ timescales ] ) and the ensuing simplification of the object - pointer dynamics in sec .  [ sec - sep_time_scales ] .",
    "[ sec - entanglementvsdecoherence ] contains a separate study of the two dynamical processes producing the entanglement of the object with the pointer and the loss of coherences between well - separated pointer readings .",
    "that section is pedagogical in character and serves to fix the notation and to introduce the relevant time scales ; readers familiar with the theory of quantum measurement might want to skip the section save for secs .",

    "[ sec - conclusion ] .",
    "appendices  [ app - noninteracting_gas ] and [ app - total_equilibrium ] are devoted to an example for a measurement apparatus and to a technical derivation of an approximation for the pointer - bath thermal state .",
    "we review in appendix  [ app - correl_functions ] the general properties of two - point correlation functions used in secs .",
    "[ simul_results]-[sec_derivation ] .",
    "finally , we discuss the qclt and its consequences ( wick theorem for the bath correlation functions ) in appendix  [ app - characteristic - functional ] .",
    "let us point out that a short report of our results can be found in  @xcite .    before going on ,",
    "some remarks may be permitted to put our paper in perspective .",
    "remaining within the frame of quantum mechanics and its probabilistic interpretation , we are concerned with unitary evolution of the composite system object + apparatus .",
    "we discard information about the ( dynamics of ) the microscopic degrees of freedom of the apparatus ( `` bath '' ) and their entanglement with pointer and object by tracing out the bath ( see secs .  [ sec - decoherence ] and  @xcite ) .",
    "we so obtain a reduced object - pointer density operator with an irreversible evolution .",
    "pointer and object end up in the mixed state ( [ eq - simultaneous ] ) wherein the different pointer states @xmath24 correspond to macroscopically distinguishable positions .",
    "such states have quantum uncertainties in position and momentum much smaller than the scales of macroscopic readings .",
    "therefore , the irreversible process ( [ eq - simultaneous ] ) leaves a pointer position revealing an eigenvalue of the measured object variable . over many runs of the measurement ,",
    "the outcome @xmath25 arises with probability @xmath26 .",
    "similar behavior arises for all processes where initially microscopic fluctuations evolve towards macroscopically distinct outcomes .",
    "a nice example is provided by superfluorescence where light pulses with substantial shot - to - shot fluctuations grow from initial quantum uncertainties @xcite .",
    " let us also recall that quantum mechanics is not compatible with the idea that the specific outcome of a single run is predetermined by some unknown but `` real '' property of the object ( such a property being independent of the measurement apparatus )  @xcite .",
    "competing hidden - variable theories which indulge in such more `` intuitive '' notions of reality than quantum mechanics have been experimentally falsified @xcite in ever larger classes , most recently even in non - local variants @xcite , while the respective quantum predictions were invariably confirmed .",
    "as many authors  @xcite we consider a three - partite system : the object of measurement is some microscopic system ( @xmath27 ) ; a single - degree - of - freedom macroscopic pointer ( @xmath28 ) will allow readouts ; finally , a bath ( @xmath29 ) with many ( @xmath30 ) degrees of freedom serves to decohere distinct pointer readings .",
    "we shall have to deal with the following dynamical variables : for @xmath27 , the observable @xmath31 to be measured ; for @xmath28 the position @xmath32 and momentum @xmath33 ; and for @xmath29 , a certain coupling agent @xmath34 given by a sum of @xmath35 self - adjoint operators @xmath36 acting on single degrees of freedom of the bath .",
    "the pointer is coupled to @xmath27 and @xmath29 via the hamiltonians @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a coupling constant and @xmath39 a positive integer .",
    "the object - pointer coupling @xmath40 is chosen so as to ( i ) not change the measured observable @xmath1 ( i.e. , @xmath41=0 $ ] ) ; ( ii )  be capable of shifting the pointer position by an amount proportional to @xmath31 , in such a way that each eigenvalue @xmath0 of @xmath1 becomes tied up with a specific pointer reading ; ( iii )  be a strong coupling ( @xmath38 is large ) , so that different eigenvalues @xmath42 eventually become associated with pointer readings separated by large distances .",
    "the pointer - bath interaction @xmath43 is chosen for the most efficient decoherence of distinct pointer positions  @xcite . depending on the value of @xmath39 ,",
    "nonlinear ( @xmath44 ) as well as linear ( @xmath45 ) couplings will be considered  @xcite .",
    "the additivity of the bath coupling agent @xmath34 in single - degree - of - freedom contributions @xmath36 having zero mean and positive variance with respect to the bath thermal state will allow us to invoke the quantum central limit theorem when taking the limit @xmath46 .",
    "the factor @xmath47 in front of the sum in ( [ eq - int_hamiltonian ] ) is introduced for convergence purposes ( the same scaling with @xmath35 is familiar to the classical clt ) ; note that the pointer - bath coupling constants are incorporated within the operators @xmath36 .",
    "the free evolutions of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are generated by the respective hamiltonians @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "we do not have to specify @xmath48 .",
    "the pointer hamiltonian @xmath51 has a potential @xmath52 with a local minimum at @xmath53 , so that @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the bath hamiltonian @xmath50 is like @xmath34 a sum of hamiltonians acting on single degrees of freedom , @xmath56 .",
    "we thus disregard couplings between different degrees of freedom of the bath .",
    "the hamiltonian of the full system @xmath57 is @xmath58 .",
    "an example of a physical system realizing the apparatus @xmath59 is given in appendix  [ app - noninteracting_gas ] .",
    "we now proceed to describing the initial states allowed for .",
    "it is appropriate to require initial statistical independence between object and apparatus .",
    "the initial density operator @xmath60 of the object may represent a pure or a mixed state .",
    "two types of initial conditions for the apparatus will be considered .",
    "the first one , to be referred to as partial equilibrium , is a product state in which @xmath28 has some density operator @xmath61 and @xmath29 is at thermal equilibrium with the gibbs density operator @xmath62 , wherein @xmath63 is the inverse temperature .",
    "for this first initial state all three subsystems are statistically independent . in the second ( more realistic ) initial state ,",
    "the apparatus is in thermal equilibrium according to the density operator @xmath64 .",
    "the two initial states of @xmath57 are    [ eq - init_state ] @xmath65    we further specify the partial - equilibrium state ( [ parteqapp ] ) by requiring that the probability density @xmath66 to find the pointer at position @xmath67 has a single peak of width @xmath68 centered at @xmath53 .",
    "a momentum uncertainty @xmath69 defines a second length scale @xmath70 .",
    "a macroscopic pointer has both @xmath71 and @xmath70 negligibly small against any macroscopic read - out scale @xmath72 , @xmath73 where the first inequality is the uncertainty principle .",
    "we shall also require that @xmath74 which means that the state @xmath61 is not highly squeezed in momentum or in position . as a concrete example we may consider a gaussian pointer density matrix @xmath75 if @xmath28 is initially in a pure state then @xmath76 , which implies that this state has the minimum uncertainty product @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath78",
    ".    the gaussian density ( [ eq - rhop ] ) also arises if @xmath28 is in a gibbs state @xmath79 provided that the potential @xmath52 is confining and @xmath80 is small enough .",
    "to see this , we note that the pointer observables @xmath23 and @xmath81 evolve noticeably under the hamiltonian @xmath49 on a _ classical time scale _ @xmath11 , which is much larger than all other ( quantum ) time scales in the model .",
    "in particular , @xmath11 is much larger than the thermal time , @xmath82 . as a result ,",
    "the matrix elements @xmath83 of @xmath84 can be approximated by @xmath85 , wherein @xmath86 is the thermal de broglie wavelength .",
    "the reader may recognize in this expression the short - time behavior of the quantum propagator @xmath87 for @xmath88 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "since the potential @xmath52 has a local minimum at @xmath53 , it can be approximated near the origin by a quadratic potential , @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , for small @xmath67 and @xmath90 , @xmath91 has the gaussian form ( [ eq - rhop ] ) with @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "it is important to bear in mind the separation of length scales @xmath94 .",
    "inasmuch as the pointer classical time scale @xmath11 may be defined as @xmath95 , the fact that @xmath96 is much smaller than @xmath97 is equivalent to @xmath82 . to fix ideas , for @xmath98 1 s , @xmath99 1 g , @xmath100 cm , and a temperature of 1 k the above - mentioned length scales differ by more than eight orders of magnitude .",
    "hence ( [ eq - lenghtscales ] ) and ( [ eq - no_squeezing ] ) are well satisfied if @xmath101 .",
    "all of these illustrations , including the gaussian ( [ eq - rhop ] ) , are meant to give an intuitive picture .",
    "what we shall need in actual fact is the quasi - classical nature of the pointer initial state , as implied by ( [ eq - lenghtscales ] ) and ( [ eq - no_squeezing ] ) , together with the single - peak character of the initial density of pointer positions .",
    "let us point out an essential difference between our model and the interacting spin model of  @xcite .",
    "unlike in this reference , @xmath27 is strongly coupled to a single degree of freedom ( the pointer @xmath28 ) of the apparatus , e.g. with its total momentum @xmath81 in a given direction ( see appendix  [ app - noninteracting_gas ] ) .",
    "the coupling of @xmath27 with the other apparatus degrees of freedom ( the bath @xmath29 , for us ) is assumed to be much weaker and can therefore be neglected , as will be seen in sec .",
    "[ sec - markov ] . given the separation of time scales ( [ timescales ] ) and",
    "our choice of a quasi - classical pointer initial state , the pointer hamiltonian @xmath49 only plays a role in providing an amplification mechanism , as we shall see in secs .",
    "[ sec - simplified_dynamics ] and [ sec - unstable_v ] .",
    "hence allowing @xmath28 to have two or three degrees of freedom , instead of one , would make the notation more cumbersome without changing significantly the results .",
    "our results below should also remain valid if the bath consists of interacting degrees of freedom ( like in a spin chain ) provided that the ( spin - spin ) correlations @xmath102 in the bath thermal state decay more rapidly than @xmath103 as @xmath104 . in fact , the validity of the qclt can be extended in this context  @xcite .",
    "decoherence via coupling with a bath of interacting spins and random matrix models for the coupling and bath have been considered in @xcite .",
    "we shall study the dynamics of the reduced state of @xmath105 ( object and pointer ) .",
    "that state is defined by a density operator @xmath106 obtained by tracing out the bath degrees of freedom in the state of @xmath57 , @xmath107 here and in what follows , @xmath108 refers to the partial trace over the hilbert space of @xmath109 or @xmath29 . when tracing out the bath we admit the inability to acquire information about it  @xcite .",
    "let us denote by @xmath110 the time - evolved observable @xmath1 in the absence of the coupling @xmath40 , i.e. , for the dynamics implemented by the `` free hamiltonian '' @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , let @xmath111 and @xmath112 be the time - evolved observables @xmath23 and @xmath34 when both couplings @xmath40 and @xmath43 are turned off : namely , @xmath113 one may associate with the time evolution of @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath110 four distinct time scales .",
    "the time scale @xmath114 has been already introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec - model ] ; it is the time scale for significant evolution of @xmath115 ( or , equivalently , of @xmath116 ) when the pointer is in the initial state @xmath61 .",
    "the gaussian form ( [ eq - rhop ] ) for @xmath61 and the no - squeezing condition ( [ eq - no_squeezing ] ) make sure that @xmath11 is indeed a classical time .",
    "the _ bath correlation time _",
    "@xmath21 is defined with the help of the @xmath117-point correlation functions @xmath118 for simplicity we assume @xmath119 since the bath has infinitely many degrees of freedom , @xmath120 decays to zero as @xmath121 goes to infinity .",
    "we define @xmath21 ( respectively @xmath122 ) as the largest ( smallest ) time constant characterizing the variations of @xmath123 .",

    "this means that @xmath123 vanishes if @xmath117 is odd and is given if @xmath117 is even by sums of products of two - point functions , @xmath125 that manifestation of the qclt amounts to gaussian statistics for the bath correlation functions .",
    "it follows from ( [ eq - wick ] ) that @xmath21 ( @xmath122 ) can be defined more simply as the largest ( smallest ) time scale associated with the variations of @xmath126 as function of @xmath127 .",
