    "this is particularly interesting for transport properties of liquids , where , due to the complexity of the involved physical mechanisms , other theoretical approaches are often unsatisfactory .",
    "hence , molecular dynamics is a promising method for predicting transport properties of liquids .",
    "however , the number of publications regarding transport properties for technically relevant liquid systems that achieve quantitatively accurate results is still low . the majority of these publications deals with the self - diffusion coefficient , leaving aside the more demanding maxwell - stefan diffusion coefficient , shear viscosity and thermal conductivity .",

    "there are several works on transport properties of associating mixtures : typically , aqueous solutions of methanol @xcite or ethanol @xcite have been studied using molecular dynamics simulation . however , to our knowledge the mixture methanol + ethanol has not yet been regarded in that sense .    two fundamentally different methods for calculating transport properties by molecular dynamics simulation are available .",

    "these models have been optimized on the basis of experimental data of vapor pressure and saturated liquid density in the whole temperature range from the triple point to the critical point .",
    "no experimental data for transport properties was thereby taken into account .",
    "the most significant transport properties , i.e. self - diffusion coefficient , shear viscosity and thermal conductivity , were regarded here for the pure liquids using emd and nemd .",
    "furthermore , the two molecular models were tested regarding the prediction of self- and maxwell - stefan diffusion coefficients and shear viscosity of the binary mixture . additionally , binary vapor - liquid equilibria as well as excess volume and excess enthalpy were predicted .",
    "the goal of this study is to demonstrate the ability of rigid , non - polarizable molecular models , adjusted to pure substance vapor - liquid equilibria only , to accurately describe the transport properties of strongly polar and h - bonding liquids .",

    "the methanol model has two lj sites , i.e. one for the methyl group and one for the hydroxyl group . additionally , three point charges are superimposed , i.e. one at each of the lj site centers and one at the nucleus position of the hydroxyl hydrogen .",
    "ethanol was modeled by three lj sites , i.e. one for the methyl , the methylene and the hydroxyl group each .",
    "three point charges are located here as well on the methylene and hydroxyl lj site centers and on the nucleus position of the hydroxyl hydrogen .",
    "the parameter set of the methanol model was obtained using the optimization procedure of stoll @xcite on the basis of the geometry of the model from van leeuwen and smit @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the ethanol model was derived from ab initio quantum chemistry calculations .",
    "the aua4 parameters of ungerer et al .",
    "@xcite were applied for the methyl and methylene lj sites .",
    "the point charge , lj size and energy parameters as well as the offset of the hydroxyl lj site were fitted to experimental vapor pressure and saturated liquid density .",
    "it should be pointed out that no information on transport or mixture properties was included in the optimization procedures of any molecular model employed here so that the data presented below is strictly predictive .",

    "dynamic properties can be obtained from emd simulations by means of the green - kubo formalism @xcite .",
    "these equations are a direct relationship between a transport coefficient and the time integral of an autocorrelation function of a particular microscopic flux in a system in equilibrium .",

    "the collective character of the maxwell - stefan diffusion coefficient is evident .",
    "since the present simulations provide self- as well as the maxwell - stefan diffusion coefficients simultaneously , a comparison to the simple predictive approach suggested by darken @xcite is possible .",
    "the maxwell - stefan diffusion coefficient @xmath29 is estimated from the self - diffusion coefficients of the two components @xmath21 and @xmath33 in the binary mixture @xcite    @xmath34    this approach was found to be superior to the correlations by vignes @xcite and by caldwell and babb @xcite in prior work on three binary mixtures @xcite . however , it is of little practical use due to the fact that it relies on the self - diffusion coefficients in the mixture , which are rarely available .      the shear viscosity @xmath35 , as defined by newton s `` law '' of viscosity , is a measure of the resistance of a fluid to a shearing force @xcite .",
    "it is associated with momentum transport under the influence of velocity gradients .",
    "hence , the shear viscosity can be related to the time autocorrelation function of the off - diagonal elements of the stress tensor @xmath36 @xcite    @xmath37    where @xmath38 stands for the molar volume , @xmath39 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath40 denotes the temperature . averaging over all three independent elements of the stress tensor ,",

    "( [ shear_t ] ) is the kinetic energy contribution and the second term is the potential energy contribution to the shear viscosity .",
    "consequently , the green - kubo integral ( [ shear ] ) can be decomposed into three parts , i.e. the kinetic energy contribution , the potential energy contribution and the mixed kinetic - potential energy contribution @xcite .",

    "the thermal conductivity @xmath50 , as defined by fourier s `` law '' of heat conduction , characterizes the capability of a substance for molecular energy transport driven by temperature gradients . in bd - nemd simulation used in this work ,",
    "two slabs of a given thickness , large enough to contain a sufficiently large number of molecules on average but much smaller than the total length of the simulation volume in @xmath51 direction , are defined . in order to create a heat flux in @xmath51 direction ,",
    "the molecule with the highest kinetic energy in the cold slab is selected with a frequency @xmath52 to perform a hypothetical elastic collision with the molecule having the lowest kinetic energy in the hot slab @xcite .",
    "after such a virtual collision the two molecules have exchanged their momentum without changing their respective position in space .",
    "the new velocity of the molecule in the cold region is then    @xmath53    and , for the molecule in the hot region    @xmath54    where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the respective masses of the selected molecules in the cold and hot slabs . @xmath57 and @xmath58 stand , respectively , for the velocities of the molecules before and after the collision .    during the elastic collision the molecules exchange their momentum .",
    "thus , the total momentum and the total energy of the system remain constant .",
    "the kinetic energy exchanged by means of these elastic collisions determines the energy flux in the system . the heat flow density in the steady state is then given by    @xmath59    in this expression , @xmath60 is the cross sectional area in @xmath46 and @xmath47 direction , @xmath25 is the time interval of measure in the steady state during which a given number of momentum transfers have occurred .",
    "@xmath61 is the heat flux in @xmath51 direction , which can indistinctly be evaluated in the cold or the hot slab .",
    "it is required that the number of molecules in both slabs is sufficiently large so that the intermolecular interactions within the slabs will properly thermalize the velocity distribution before a new collision takes place .",

    "the mobility of the model molecules increases slightly more rapidly than that of real methanol molecules .",
    "hence , for temperatures above 300 k the self - diffusion coefficient was overestimated on average by @xmath688% .",

    "the present results cover the widest temperature range . the broadest available study by haughney et al .",
    "@xcite , using a modified jorgensen model , is comparable with present results near ambient temperature where average deviations are 9 % .",

    "the predicted data also correctly reproduces the temperature dependence over the whole temperature range from @xmath69 to @xmath70 k. contrary to previous simulation reports @xcite , where the self - diffusion coefficient of ethanol has mostly been significantly overestimated , deviations of the present data are negative and on average only @xmath71% .",

    "it should be pointed out that the highest deviation , being 20% , was found at the lowest regarded temperature 220 k. here , the high density in combination with strongly interacting molecules causes large simulation uncertainties due to the long - time behavior of the shear viscosity autocorrelation function .",

    "the velocity autocorrelation function provides an interesting insight into the liquid state .",
    "selected normalized velocity autocorrelation functions ( vacf ) of pure methanol and ethanol are shown in figure [ figvacf ] . in agreement with findings in the literature @xcite",
    ", vacf may have two minima at short times ( @xmath80 ) . at low temperatures and high densities , the vacf of both pure liquids decrease sharply and become negative .",
    "after this first minimum , they increase slightly to drop again into a lower minimum , for methanol , or to a higher minimum , for ethanol . beyond the second minimum ,",
    "the vacf converge to zero following a characteristic path .",
    "the observed negative values of the vacf are related to backscattering collisions , also known as cage - effect , which govern short time dynamics . here",
    ", the free movement of the molecules is hindered by surrounding molecules , which form a cage - like structure .",
    "michels and trappeniers @xcite attributed this phenomenon to the formation of `` bound states '' since this effect can only be observed for molecular models that include attractive forces .    for higher temperatures at ambient pressure , where the liquid density is lower , molecular collisions",
    "are less frequent and the depth of the minima is gradually reduced until they almost disappear , cf . figure [ figvacf ] . at short times , the vacf decay faster at lower temperatures . moreover , the initial decay of the vacf of methanol occurs earlier than in the corresponding vacf of ethanol .",
    "methanol vacf exhibit a more pronounced backscattering oscillations than those of ethanol , particularly at low temperatures near its melting temperature ( @xmath81 k ) @xcite .",

    "alder et al .",
    "@xcite were the first to suggest the existence of a long - time tail in the shear viscosity autocorrelation function ( sacf ) near the phase boundary to solidification due to the low compressibility of such liquid states .",
    "luo and hoheisel @xcite showed that the long - time behavior of the sacf is determined primarily by long - lived orientational correlations , occurring in liquids containing anisotropic molecules .",
    "this behavior causes convergence problems in the green - kubo integral , since the sacf must be calculated over a relatively long time interval .",
    "figure [ figsacf ] shows selected normalized sacf of pure methanol .",
    "the presence of a significant long - time tail can clearly be noticed in figure [ figintsacf ] where the integrals of the sacf of methanol are plotted for three temperatures .",
    "as expected , the behavior of the long - time tail of the sacf is highly dependent on molecule species and state point .",

    "k this contribution reaches @xmath87 . this difference can be explained by the higher molecular anisotropy of ethanol .",
    "the kinetic , potential and mixed kinetic - potential energy contributions to the sacf were also considered in this work . over the whole regarded range of state points , the behavior of the kinetic contribution is analogous to the monotonic chair - like decay of autocorrelation functions for non - attractive fluids .",

    "the potential energy contribution shows at short times oscillations similar to those of the vacf , cf .",

    "it was found that there are only minor differences in the liquid structure as revealed by the three radial distribution functions @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 . the position and height of the first peaks are almost identical for both models , with the exception of @xmath98 , where a more pronounced peak is observed for the rigid model , cf .",
    "figure [ figrdf ] .",
    "only small differences are noted around the second peak of @xmath95 and @xmath96 , mainly related to the molecules hydrogen bonded in the second solvation shell . in the latter case ,",
    "a more pronounced second peak was found for the rigid model . in general",
    ", it can be said that the inclusion of the flexibility does not strongly affect the structure of liquid ethanol around the first solvation shell .    in the next step ,",

    "this value is higher by a factor of @xmath104 compared to the self - diffusion coefficient obtained for the rigid model ( @xmath105 ) which is in excellent agreement with the experimental data ( @xmath106 ) @xcite .",
    "this comparison shows the impact of the internal degrees of freedom on the hydrogen bond dynamics and the self - diffusion coefficient .",
    "similar effects can be expected also for other transport properties .",
    "flexible and rigid models of h - bonding systems obviously show significant differences regarding transport properties .",
    "this should also be kept in mind when assessing the comparisons of different models shown throughout this work .",
    "vapor - liquid equilibria ( vle ) often serve as a benchmark to assess molecular models .",
    "this is a useful choice , due to the fact that vle represent the dominant feature in the region of fluid states .",
    "indeed , they are nowadays preferably being used in the development of molecular models by optimizing the model parameters to vle properties .",
    "this approach was also followed in the development of both regarded pure fluid models . in the next step ,",
    "molecular models can be assessed on how they perform in mixtures .",
    "based on experience for numerous binaries and ternaries , very good success can be expected , if the pure substance models are good .",
    "calculated vle data of pure methanol and ethanol using present potential models have been reported previously for a temperature range from 270 to 490 k @xcite .",
    "the average deviations found for methanol in vapor pressure , saturated liquid density and heat of vaporization are of 1.1 , 0.6 , and 5.5% , respectively @xcite .",
    "the corresponding reported average deviations for ethanol are of 3.7 , 0.3 and 0.9% , respectively @xcite .",
    "present simulation results for the binary vle are given in table [ resvle ] and compared in figures [ figvle ] and [ figvlexy ] to experimental data by butcher and robinson @xcite and to the peng - robinson equation of state @xcite .",
    "as in the molecular simulations no adjustment to binary data was carried out , also the peng - robinson equation was used without any adjustment to such data ( @xmath107  =  @xmath108 ) .",
    "figure [ figvle ] shows the almost `` ideal '' behavior of methanol + ethanol for two temperatures .",
    "in fact , these were the highest two isotherms for which experimental data were available to us . at the higher one ( 443.15 k ) ,",
    "however , it can be seen from the experimental data that the bubble line is not fully linear .",
    "the comparison of simulation and experiment is excellent throughout , both the pressure slope and the composition relation between vapor and liquid match good , only minor deviations are found in the ethanol - rich composition range where slightly too high vapor compositions are obtained .",
    "excess properties are basic mixing properties which contain real mixing behavior . in case of methanol + ethanol non - ideal mixing",
    "effects are very weak . at equimolar composition ,",
    "where the mixing influence is strongest , experimental data suggest a volume increase of 0.017% only .",
    "also for enthalpy , a tiny positive excess contribution of 0.011 % was found by experiment .",
    "this resolution is difficult to achieve by molecular simulation .    to determine excess properties , a straightforward approach was used here .",
    "three simulations at specified temperature and pressure were performed , two for the pure substances and one of the mixture at a given composition . a binary excess property given by    @xmath109    where @xmath110 represents the excess volume @xmath111 or the excess enthalpy @xmath112 .",
    "enthalpies or volumes of the pure liquids methanol and ethanol as well as of their binary mixture are denoted by @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "table [ resexcess ] contains present simulation data for ambient conditions which are compared to experimental results @xcite in figures [ figve ] and [ fighe ] . the excess volume , cf .",
    "figure [ figve ] , agrees with the experiment in all cases within its seemingly large error bars .",
    "however , it should be noted that the simulation uncertainty is only around 0.1% of the total volume of the mixture . a slight tendency of the simulation data towards higher excess volumes might be assumed . in figure",
    "[ fighe ] , the present excess enthalpy is shown together with experimental data .",
    "the maximal excess contribution from experiment is only 0.011% , which is well below the simulation uncertainty of around 0.1% . by inspection of the simulation data set as a whole ,",
    "an even better agreement with experiment can be assumed .",
    "transport and mixture properties for methanol and ethanol were predicted by molecular dynamics simulation on the basis of rigid , non - polarizable molecular models from preceding work .",
    "self- and maxwell - stefan diffusion coefficients as well as shear viscosity were calculated by emd and the green - kubo formalism .",
    "comparing to experimental data for the two pure alcohols , present self - diffusion coefficient and shear viscosity data are very good to excellent over a temperature range of about 100 k. slightly higher deviations were found for the shear viscosity at low temperatures , which are mainly due to the long - time behavior of the shear viscosity autocorrelation function . regarding the mixture methanol + ethanol at ambient conditions over the full composition range , both self - diffusion coefficients also excellently agree with experimental data .",
    "the same holds for shear viscosity , especially in the methanol - rich region .",
    "maxwell - stefan diffusion coefficient data is , to our knowledge , not available in the literature .",
    "present predictions correspond very well with the model of darken .",
    "the thermal conductivity was determined by bd reverse nemd . over a temperature range of about 100 k , an excellent agreement with the experiment",
    "was found as well for both pure fluids . furthermore , predicted vle data for the mixture methanol + ethanol along two isotherms correspond with experimental data practically throughout within the simulation uncertainty .",
    "the same holds for excess volume and excess enthalpy at ambient conditions in the full composition range .",
    "it has been demonstrated that present rigid , non - polarizable models for ethanol and methanol show a better performance to reproduce transport properties when compared to standard rigid and flexible models available in the literature .",
    "in this work , emd simulations for transport properties were made in two steps . in the first step ,",
    "a short simulation in the isobaric - isothermal ( @xmath115 ) ensemble was performed at ambient pressure to calculate the density at the desired temperature . in the second step ,",
    "a canonic ( @xmath116 ) ensemble simulation was performed at this temperature and density , to determine the transport properties .",
    "the simulations were carried out in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions containing @xmath117 molecules .",
    "newton s equations of motion were solved using a fifth - order gear predictor - corrector numerical integrator .",
    "the temperature was controlled by velocity scaling . in all emd simulations ,",
    "the integration time step was @xmath118 fs . the cut - off radius was set to @xmath119  .",
    "electrostatic long - range corrections were made using the reaction field technique with conducting boundary conditions @xmath120 .",
    "on the basis of a center of mass cut - off scheme , the lj long - range interactions were corrected using angle averaging @xcite .",

    "diffusion coefficients and shear viscosity were calculated using eqs .",
    "( [ self ] ) to ( [ shear ] ) with up to @xmath124 independent time origins of the autocorrelation functions .",
    "the sampling length of the autocorrelation functions varied between @xmath125 and @xmath126 ps .",
    "the separation between time origins was chosen so that all autocorrelation functions have decayed at least to @xmath127 of their normalized value to guarantee their time independence @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties of the predicted values were estimated using a block averaging method @xcite .    in the nemd simulations with the pex algorithm for the thermal conductivity ,",
    "800 molecules were placed in a parallelepiped box with @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the length of the simulation box in the different spatial directions .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were applied in all directions . the system was then equilibrated over 1 ns at the desired temperature and pressure by @xmath115 simulation using a weak coupling bath @xcite with long - range corrections @xcite for pressure and energy . the resulting density of the equilibration run was then employed to generate a new set of simulations in order to develop the thermal gradient in a run of 2 ns using the nemd scheme . in this case",
    "an exchange frequency @xmath130 ( i.e. every @xmath131 time steps ) for the energy flux was used .",
    "electrostatic interactions were treated with the reaction field with conducting boundary conditions .",
    "the thermal conductivity was then computed as the average of 4 different runs over 1 ns .",
    "the integration of the equations of motion was performed with a time step of 2 fs with a cut - off radius of 12  .",
    "a verlet neighbor list was employed to improve the performance of the simulations .",
    "the vle calculations of the mixture methanol + ethanol were performed using the grand equilibrium method @xcite in combination with the gradual insertion technique @xcite .",
    "the latter , a monte carlo based expanded ensemble method , was applied to determine the chemical potential in the liquid phase . in comparison to widom s test particle method @xcite , where a full molecule is inserted into the fluid , the gradual insertion method introduces a fluctuating molecule .",
    "this molecule undergoes changes in a set of discrete states of coupling with all other real molecules of the fluid .",
    "preferential sampling was performed in the vicinity of the fluctuating molecule to improve accuracy .",
    "the gradual insertion simulations were done with 500 molecules in the liquid phase .",
    "starting from a face - centered cubic lattice arrangement , the simulation runs were equilibrated over @xmath132 cycles in the @xmath115 ensemble .",
