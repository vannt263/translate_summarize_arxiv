    "the discovery @xcite of fluctuations or anisotropies , at the level of @xmath4 , associated with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has helped transformed the physics of the early universe into a main - stream research area in astronomy and in particle astrophysics , both theoretically and observationally @xcite .",
    "cmb anisotropies@xcite and polarizations@xcite , the latter even smaller and at the level of @xmath5 , either primary ( as imprinted on the last scattering surface just before the universe was @xmath6 years old ) or secondary ( as might be caused by the interactions of cmb photons with large - scale structures along the line of sight ) , are linked closely to the inhomogeneities produced in the early universe .    over the last three decades ,",
    "the standard model of particle physics has been well established to the precision level of @xmath4 or better in the electroweak sector , or to the level of @xmath7 for the strong interactions . in the theory , the electroweak ( ew ) phase transition , which endows masses to the various particles , and the qcd phase transition , which gives rise to confinement of quarks and gluons within hadrons in the true qcd vacuum , are two well - established phenomena . presumably , the ew and qcd phase transitions would have taken place in the early universe , respectively , at around @xmath8 and at a time between @xmath9 and @xmath1 , or at the temperature of about @xmath10 and of about @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "indeed , it has become imperative to formulate the ew and qcd phase transitions in the early universe if a quantitative theory of cosmology can ever be reached .",
    "the purpose of this work is to focus our attention on cosmological qcd phase transition and to assess whether its roles in the early universe can be synthesized in a more quantitative terms - a problem which has become one of the most challenging problems in the physics of the early universe .",
    "to simplify the situation , we use the bag - model language and try to model the degenerate @xmath3-vacua , the lower - temperature phase , as the minima of the spontaneously - broken complex scalar fields . in particular , we try to set up the strategy of tackling the problem by dividing it into problems in four different categories , viz . :",
    "( 1 ) how a bubble of different vacuum grows or shrinks ; ( 2 ) how two growing bubbles collide or squeeze , and merging , with each other ; ( 3 ) how the universe eventually stabilize itself later while keeping expanding for several orders of magnitude ; and ( 4 ) how specific objects , such as back holes or magnetic strings , get produced during the specific phase transition .",
    "questions related to part ( 4 ) , which are quite complicated , will not be addressed here ; see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite . in the framework which we consider",
    ", we could describe the intermediate solutions based on the so - called `` pasted '' or `` patched '' domain walls when the majority of the false vacua get first eliminated - but how it would evolve from there and how long it would evolve still uncertain .",
    "* the major result of this paper is that the latent heat ( or latent energy ) , which turns out to be identified as the `` bag constant '' , is huge compared to the radiation density at the cosmological qcd phase transition ( i.e. at about @xmath11 ) .",
    "as time evolved to the present , the percentage of this quantity becomes probably the majority of dark matter ( 25 % of the composition of the present universe ) . *",
    "a prevailing view regarding our universe is that it originates from the joint making of einstein s general relativity and the cosmological principle while the observed anisotropies associated with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , at the level of about one part in 100,000 , may stem , e.g. , from quantum fluctuations in the inflation era . in what follows ,",
    "we wish to first outline very briefly a few key points in the standard scenario so that we shall have a framework which we may employ to elucidate the roles of phase transitions in the early universe .",
    "based upon the cosmological principle which state that our universe is homogeneous and isotropic , we use the robertson - walker metric to describe our universe@xcite .",
    "@xmath12 here the parameter @xmath13 describes the spatial curvature with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 referring to an open , closed , and flat universe , respectively .",
    "the scale factor @xmath17 describes the size of the universe at time @xmath18 .    to a reasonable first approximation",
    ", the universe can be described by a perfect fluid , i.e. , a fluid with the energy - momentum tensor @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the energy density and @xmath21 the pressure .",
    "thus , the einstein equation , @xmath22 , gives rise to only two independent equations , i.e. , from @xmath23 and @xmath24 components ,    @xmath25    @xmath26    combining with the equation of state ( eos ) , i.e. the relation between the pressure @xmath21 and the energy density @xmath20 , we can solve the three functions @xmath17 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 from the three equations .",
    "further , the above two equations yields @xmath29 showing either that there is a positive cosmological constant or that @xmath30 must be somehow negative , if the major conclusion of the supernovae cosmology project is correct @xcite , i.e. the expansion of our universe still accelerating ( @xmath31 ) .    assuming a simple equation of state , @xmath32 , we obtain , from eqs . ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ,    @xmath33    which is applicable when a particular component dominates over the others - such as in the inflation era ( before the hot big bang era ) , the radiation - dominated universe ( e.g. the early stage of the hot big bang era ) , and the matter - dominated universe ( i.e. , the late stage of the hot big bang era , before the dark energy sets in to dominate everything else ) . _ in light of cosmological qcd phase transition , we would like to examine if the radiation - dominate universe and the matter - dominated universe could ever exist at all , since this has become a dogma in the thinking of our universe . _    for the * inflation era * , we could write @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( for simplicity ) , so that @xmath36 which has an exponentially growing , or decaying , solution @xmath37 , compatible with the so - called `` inflation '' or `` big inflation '' .",
    "in fact , considering the simplest case of a real scalar field @xmath38 , we have @xmath39 so that , when the `` kinetic '' term @xmath40 is negligible , we have an equation of state , @xmath41 .",
    "in addition to its possible role as the `` inflaton '' responsible for inflation , such field has also been invoked to explain the accelerating expansion of the present universe , as dubbed as `` quintessence '' or `` complex quintessence''@xcite .",
    "let s look at the standard textbook argument leading to the radiation - dominated universe and the matter - dominated universe :    for the * radiation - dominated universe * , we have @xmath42 . for simplicity , we assume that the curvature is zero ( @xmath35 ) and that the cosmological constant is negligible ( @xmath43 ) . in this case , we find from eq .",
    "( 5 ) @xmath44    another simple consequence of the homogeneous model is to derive the continuity equation from eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) : @xmath45 accordingly , we have @xmath46 for a radiation - dominated universe ( @xmath47 ) while @xmath48 for a matter - dominated universe ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the present universe is believed to have a matter content of about 5% , or of the density of about @xmath50 , much bigger than its radiation content @xmath51 , as estimated from the @xmath52 black - body radiation . however , as @xmath53 , we anticipate @xmath54 , extrapolated back to a very small universe as compared to the present one . therefore , the universe is necessarily dominated by the radiation during its early enough epochs .    for the radiation - dominated early epochs of the universe with @xmath35 and @xmath43",
    ", we could deduce , also from eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , @xmath55 these equations tell us a few important times in the early universe , such as @xmath56 when the temperature @xmath57 is around @xmath58 during which the electroweak ( ew ) phase transition is expected to occur , or somewhere between @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) and @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) during which quarks and gluons undergo the qcd confinement phase transition .    for the * matter - dominated universe * , we have @xmath63 , together with the assumption that @xmath35 and @xmath64 .",
    "( 5 ) yields @xmath65 as mentioned earlier , the matter density @xmath66 scales like @xmath67 , or @xmath68 , the latter similar in the radiation - dominated case .    when @xmath69 , we have @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which are close to each other and it is almost near the end of the radiation - dominated universe",
    ". the present age of the universe is 13.7 billion years - for a large part of it , it is matter - dominated although now we have plenty of dark energy ( 65% @xmath72 70% ) .",
    "however , it is generally believed that our present universe is already dominated by the dark energy ( the simplest form being of the cosmological constant ; about 70% ) and the dark matter ( about 25% ) . the question is when this was so - when the dark part became dominant .",
    "there is another basic point - trivial but important .",
    "for both the electroweak and qcd phase transitions in the early universe , if the phase transitions are described ( approximately ) by the complex fields @xmath73 , then the density of the system is given by @xmath74 before or after or during the phase transition is being taking place .",
    "for the electroweak or qcd phase transition , we know that @xmath75 , but the role played by @xmath76 is clearly of importance in our considerations .    * what would be missing in the standard textbook argument ?",
    "* we would come back in section 6 to this important point , after we set up the general framework and have gained enough of insights .",
    "the crucial point is whether cosmological qcd phase transition is the first - order phase transition - _ if it is , there is the latent `` heat '' or energy released in the transition ; the story would change dramatically if the amount of energy density turns out to be greater than either @xmath77 or @xmath66 in the previous radiation - dominated or matter - dominated era .",
    "_ we have to question what happened if @xmath77 would no longer be dominant in the radiation - dominated universe - the `` new '' dominant sector of the universe may not influence the `` old '' radiation - dominated piece but einstein equation in principle no longer guarantee its validity ( about the old , no - longer - dominant sector ) .",
    "let s try to focus on the qcd phase transition in the early universe , or on the cosmological qcd phase transition .    at the temperature @xmath78 ,",
    "i.e. , before the phase transition takes place , free quarks and gluons can roam anywhere .",
    "as the universe expands and cools , eventually passing the critical temperature @xmath79 , the bubbles nucleate here and there .",
    "these bubbles `` explode '' , as we call it `` exploding solitons '' .",
    "when it reaches the `` supercooling '' temperature , @xmath80 , or something similar , the previous bubbles become too many and in fact most of them become touched each other - now the false vacua or `` bubbles '' of different kind ( where quarks and gluons can move freely ) start to collapse - or we call it `` imploding solitons '' . when all these bubbles of different kind implode completely , the phase transition is now complete .",
    "there is some specialty regarding the qcd phase transition in the early universe .",
    "namely , the collapse of the false vacuum does depend on the inside quark - gluon content - e.g. , if we have a three - quark color - singlet combination inside , the collapse of the false vacuum would stop ( or stabilize ) at a certain radius ( we called the bag radius , like in the mit bag radius ) ; of course , there are meson configurations , glueballs , hybrids , six - quark or multi - quark configurations , etc .",
    "the qcd phase transition in the early universe does not eliminate all the false vacua ; rather , the end state of the transition could have at least lots of baryon or meson states , each of them has some false vacuum to stabilize the system .",
    "how big can a bubble grow ?",
    "it is with the fastest speed which the bubble can grow is through the speed of light or close to the speed of light .",
    "the bubble could sustain from the moment it creates , say , @xmath81 to the moment of supercooling , @xmath82 , or during the time span @xmath83 ( or @xmath84 ) .",
    "so , the bubble can at most grow into @xmath85 or @xmath86",
    ".    how big was the universe during the cosmological qcd phase transition ? compared to the size now , an estimate is the expansion of @xmath87 , a huge factor .",
    "( see the beginning of sect . 6 . ) in the simplest approximation ( when the scalar fields do nt couple to the other fields , such as gluons or quarks ) , the domain walls can not disappear - not only sometime because of the possible nontrivial topology but that there should be some qcd dynamics to annihilate the walls . in light of the huge expansion factor ,",
    "the domain wall structure can not survive , except the strict topology ( which we call `` domain - wall nuggets '' ) .    as a yardstick",
    ", we note that , at @xmath88 or @xmath89 , we have @xmath90 or , at @xmath91 or @xmath92 , we have @xmath93 slightly later when qcd phase transition has completed , at @xmath94 or @xmath95 , we have @xmath96    in what follows , we use the so - called `` bag models''@xcite to have the simplified version of quark confinement - i think it is important to use the simplified version in the complicated cosmological environment , in order to extract meaningful results .",
    "when the low - temperature bubbles start to show up ( i.e. to nucleate ) , it is about @xmath97 .",
    "this period is to be called `` exploding soliton era'',@xcite to be described in the next section ( sect .",
    "the supercooling temperature @xmath80 , presumably @xmath98 ( to be determined more reliably in the future ) , refers to the situation where the bubbles begin to saturate .",
    "we call it the `` colliding soliton era '' .",
    "this is to be described in section 5",
    ". presumably it would be over when @xmath99 or longer .",
    "so , the cosmological qcd phase transition would be over when the universe was @xmath61 old .",
    "the important things is that , because the phase transition is of the first order , it releases a huge amount of energy :    @xmath100    clearly much bigger than the radiation density ( cf .",
    "this quantity is in fact the same as `` the zero - point energy '' . *",
    "that is why we question the radiation - dominated universe .",
    "*    when the low - temperature bubbles fill up the space , the neighboring two bubbles would in general be labelled by different @xmath101 representing different but degenerate vacua - we assume that there are infinite many choices of @xmath3 ; they are degenerate but complete equivalent .",
    "the domain wall is used to separate the two regions .",
    "three different regions would meet in a line - which we call a vortex .",
    "we have to estimate the total energy associated with the domain walls and the vortices - particularly when these objects persist to live on for a `` long '' time - say , @xmath102 . these domain walls and vortices",
    "are governed , in the qcd phase transition in the early universe , by the qcd dynamics - this is an important point ; if not , what else ? it is a tough question to figure out how long the universe would stabilize itself through qcd dynamics and others ;",
    "my rough guess is from a few seconds to years , say @xmath103 .    for the moment",
    ", qcd enables us to make some estimates .",
    "let us focus on @xmath104 , where @xmath105 . or , considering a unit volume of @xmath106 , the amount of the matter would be @xmath107 or @xmath108 .",
    "one proton or neutron weighs about @xmath109 so , in a volume @xmath106 at @xmath110 , we had at least @xmath111 baryons or , in the mit bag model language , @xmath112 bags or @xmath113 false vacua associated with the system . to begin with ,",
    "all the excited baryons and mesons , including topological objects , and multi - baryons , all have equal opportunities .",
    "but , remembering @xmath114 , most space had to collapse into the true vacua with different @xmath115 .",
    "we begin our study by examining an isolated bubble - expanding , that is , inside the bubble , it is the true vacuum labelled by some @xmath3 ; outside the bubble , the false vacuum ; we are thinking of the universe cooling down and expand .",
    "that is , how the bubble nucleates in the false vacuum ( high - temperature ) .",
    "remember that this happened in the period of time when @xmath116 .",
    "consider a spherical wall of radius @xmath117 and thickness @xmath118 separating the true vacuum inside from the false vacuum outside .",
    "the energy density difference of the vacua is @xmath119 , the bag constant in the most simplified situation , and the energy @xmath103 per unit area associated with the surface tension on the separating wall is a quantity to be calculated but nevertheless is small compared to the latent heat .",
    "if the wall expands outward for a distance @xmath120 , then the energy budget arising from the vacuum change is @xmath121 where @xmath21 is the pressure and is so defined that a negative pressure would push the wall outward .",
    "( we use the notation @xmath103 here , since @xmath122 and @xmath20 are reserved for other purposes . )    when the surface tension energy required for making the wall bigger is much less than the latent heat required from the expansion of the bubble , the bubble of the stable vacuum inside will grow in an accelerating way , possibly resulting in explosive growth of the bubble . the scenario may be as follows : when the universe expands and cools , to a temperature slightly above the critical temperature @xmath79 , bubbles of lower vacua will nucleate at the spots where either the temperature is lower , and lower than @xmath79 , or the density is higher , and higher than the critical density @xmath123 . as the universe continues to expand and cool further , most places in the universe have the temperature slightly below @xmath79 ; that is , the destiny arising from eternal expansion of the universe is driving the average temperature of the entire universe toward below the critical temperature .",
    "the universe must find a way to convert itself entirely into another vacuum , the true vacuum at the lower temperature .",
    "therefore , we have a situation in which bubbles of true vacua pop up ( nucleate ) here and there , now and then , and each of them may grow explosively in the environment made of the false vacuum for now , but previously the true vacuum when the temperature was still near the critical temperature @xmath79 . in the expanding universe which cooled down relatively rapidly ,",
    "i.e. from @xmath79 to the supercooling temperature @xmath80 , the situation is awfully complicated .",
    "when the temperature becomes lower than @xmath80 , the problem can be modelled , in the simplest way , by characterizing the vacuum structure by a complex scalar field interacting via the potential @xmath124 : @xmath125 for @xmath126 , we have @xmath127 and @xmath128 , so it is between @xmath79 and @xmath80 when the situations are awfully complicated ( and we try to avoid in this paper ) .",
    "note also that , in the complex scalar field description , the true vacua have degeneracy described by a continuous real parameter @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath129 everywhere in the spacetime describes the false vacuum for the universe at a temperature below the critical temperature @xmath79 .",
    "consider the solution for a bubble of true vacuum in this environment .",
    "it is required that the field @xmath73 must satisfy the field equation everywhere in spacetime , including crossing the wall of thickness @xmath118 to connect smoothly the true vacuum inside and the false vacuum outside .",
    "this is why we may call the bubble solution `` a soliton '' , in the sense of a nontopological soliton of t.d .",
    "however , the soliton grows in an accelerating way , or the name `` exploding soliton '' .",
    "the situation must have changed so explosively that at a very short instant later the universe expands even further and cools to even a little more farther away from @xmath79 and most places in the universe must be in the true vacuum , making the previously false vacuum shrink and fractured into small regions of false vacua , presumably dominantly in spherical shape , which is shrinking in an accelerating way , or `` implosively '' . using again the complex scalar field as our language , we then have `` imploding solitons '' .",
    "in what follows , we attempt to solve the problem of an exploding soliton , assuming that the values of both the potential parameters @xmath130 and @xmath131 are fairly stable during the period of the soliton expansion .",
    "the scalar field must satisfy : @xmath132 the radius of the soliton is @xmath17 while the thickness of the wall is @xmath118 : @xmath133 with @xmath134 and @xmath135 the radial expansion velocity of the soliton .",
    "we may write @xmath136 so that the field equation becomes @xmath137 we will be looking for a solution of @xmath138 across the wall so that it connects smoothly the true - vacuum solution inside and the false vacuum solution outside .    introducing @xmath139",
    ", we find @xmath140 an equation which we may solve in exactly the same manner as the colliding - wall problem to be elucidated in the next section .",
    "when bubbles of true vacua grow explosively , the nearby pair of bubbles will soon squeeze or collide with each other , resulting in merging of the two bubbles while producing cosmological objects that have specific coupling to the system . the situation is again extremely complicated .",
    "remember that this happened when @xmath141 , not too long after .",
    "we try to disentangle the complexities by looking at between the two bubble walls that are almost ready to touch and for the initial attempt neglecting the coupling of the vacuum dynamics to the matter content . between the two bubble walls , especially between the centers of the two bubbles , it looks like a problem of plane walls in collision - and this is where we try to solve the problem to begin with .",
    "in fact , we have to consider one bubble first - the spherical situation as in the previous section but the bubble is `` very '' large we could look at the @xmath142-direction in the sufficiently good plane approximation ( i.e. all bubble surfaces are just like planes ) . at this point",
    ", we have one wall , with thickness @xmath118 , moving with velocity @xmath135 in the @xmath142 direction ; on the left of the wall is the false vacuum , and on the right the true vacuum .",
    "the wall , of thickness @xmath118 , separates the true vacuum on one side from the false vacuum on the other side of the wall . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", the wall is assumed parallel to the @xmath143plane and are infinite in both the @xmath144 and @xmath145 directions .",
    "in addition , at some instant the wall is defined between @xmath146 and @xmath147 with the instantaneous velocity @xmath148 .    for @xmath149 and all @xmath144 and @xmath145",
    ", the complex scalar field @xmath73 assumes @xmath150 , a value of the true vacuum ( the ground state ) . on the other hand , for @xmath151 and all @xmath144 and @xmath145",
    ", the complex scalar field @xmath73 assumes @xmath152 , the false vacuum . as indicated earlier",
    ", the field @xmath73 must satisfy the field equation everywhere in spacetime : @xmath153    we may write the wall on the right hand side but moving toward the left with the velocity @xmath135 : @xmath154 so that @xmath155    in fact , we are interested in the situation that the function in eq .",
    "( 20 ) is complex : @xmath156 so that , with @xmath157 , @xmath158 @xmath159 integrating the second equation , we find @xmath160 with @xmath161 an integration constant .",
    "the equation for @xmath162 is thus given by @xmath163 provided that the @xmath3 function is defined ( in the region of the true vacuum and the wall ) .",
    "let us try to focus on the last two basic equations - for @xmath162 and @xmath3 , say , as the functions of @xmath164 ( e.g. @xmath165 ) . for @xmath166 , we have @xmath167 ( the true vacuum ) and , for @xmath168 , we have @xmath169 ( the false vacuum ; with @xmath3 undetermined ) .",
    "we find , for @xmath170 , @xmath171 with @xmath172 a constant and @xmath173 regular near @xmath174 .",
    "therefore the @xmath175 function could be `` mildly singular '' or blow up near @xmath174 - this is in fact a very important point .",
    "of course , the equation for @xmath162 can be integrated out to obtain the result .",
    "for the `` wall '' region ( i.e. @xmath176 ) , the solution reads as follows : @xmath177 with @xmath178 here @xmath179 , and @xmath161 and @xmath180 parameters related to the integration constants .",
    "of course , the solution in true - vacuum region can be obtained by extension .    in the wall region",
    ", we could compute the surface energy per unit area ( i.e. surface tension mentioned earlier in eq .",
    "( 16 ) ) : @xmath181 some integral easy to calculate .",
    "there is an important note - that is , the solution for @xmath73 obtained so far applies for the true vacuum and the wall , and which is continuous in the region ; how about the false vacuum ? this is an important question because in the false vacuum we know that @xmath182 but @xmath3 is left undetermined .",
    "so , in first - order phase transitions we have certain function undefined in the false - vacuum region(s ) .",
    "this is a crucial point to keep in mind with .    as a parenthetical footnote",
    ", we note that the equation for the exploding or imploding spherical soliton , eq .",
    "( 22 ) , may be integrated and solved in an identical manner .",
    "now let us focus on the merge of the two bubbles - the growing of the two true - vacuum bubbles such that the false - vacuum region gets squeezed away .",
    "this is another difficult dynamical question .",
    "in fact , we can make the false - vacuum region approaching to zero , i.e. , the region with the solution @xmath183 gets squeezed away ; one true - vacuum region with @xmath184 and @xmath185 ( the latter for the wall ) is connected with the one with @xmath186 and @xmath187 - we could use @xmath188 to label the new boundary ; to be precise , we could call it `` the pasted domain wall '' or `` the patched domain wall '' .",
    "it is in fact two walls pasted together - if we look at the boundary condition in between , we realize that the structure would persist there for a while to go",
    ". the pasted domain wall could evolve further but this may not be relevant for counting the energies involved .",
    "the evolved forms of the pasted domain walls could be determined by the topology involved - for the purpose of this paper , we can ignore this fine aspect .",
    "suppose that the cosmological qcd phase transition was just completed - we have to caution that , not everywhere , the false vacua be replaced by the true vacua so that in between the walls be replaced ( approximately ) by the pasted domain walls .",
    "there are places for color - singlet objects ( i.e. hadrons ) which quarks and gluons tried to hide ; these places are still called by the `` false vacua '' with the volume energies . thus , the volume energy , i.e. @xmath119 in eq .",
    "( 16 ) or defined suitably via @xmath131 and @xmath130 ( in eq .",
    "( 17 ) ) , or at least some portion of it , may convert itself into the surface energy and others - @xmath189 using the so - called `` bag constant '' in the mit bag model @xcite or columbia bag model @xcite .",

    "some exercise indicates that this quantity of energy is exactly the latent `` heat '' or energy released in the first - order phase transition .",
    "the cosmological qcd phase transition should leave its qcd mark here - since the volume energy that stays with the `` false vacuum '' is simply reduced because the volumes with the `` false vacua '' are greatly reduced - but not eliminated because quarks and gluons , those objects with colors , still have some places to go ( or , to hide themselves ) .",
    "let us begin by making a simple estimate - the expansion factor since the qcd phase transition up to now .",

    ". remember that all these happened in a matter of a fraction of @xmath61 , as judging from the size of @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the next thing to happen is probably the following .",
    "we believe that the field @xmath73 , being effective , can not be lonely ; that is , there are higher - order interactions such as @xmath210 some maybe being absent because of the nature of @xmath73 . in other words , we may believe that the strong interactions are primarily responsible for the phase transition in question , such that the effective field @xmath73 couples to the gluon and quark fields ; the details of the coupling are subject to investigations .",
    "that is , when the field @xmath73 responsible for the pasted or patched domain walls is _ effective _ - the @xmath73 field couples , in the higher - order ( and thus weaker ) sense , to the gluon and quark fields .",
    "it is very difficult to estimate what time is needed for pasted domain walls to disappear , if there are no nontrivial topology involved .",
    "if there is some sort of nontrivial topology present , there should left some kind of topological domain nugget - however , energy conservation should tell us that it can not be expanded by too many orders ( but our universe did expand for many many orders of magnitude ) .",
    "i would guess that it takes about from a fraction of a second to several years ( from the strong interaction nature of the problem ) , but certainly before the last scattering surface ( i.e. @xmath211 years ) .",
    "to summarize , the energy associated with the cosmological qcd phase transition , mainly the vacuum energy associated with the false vacuum , disappeared in several ways , viz . :",
    "( 1 ) the bag energies associated with the baryons and all the other color - singlet objects , ( 2 ) the energies with all kinds of topological domain nuggets or other topological objects , and ( 3 ) the decay products from pasted or patched domain walls with trivial topology .",
    "let us begin with the critical temperature @xmath212 or @xmath213 .",
    "at this moment , we have @xmath214 here the first term is what we expect the system to release - the so - called `` latent heat '' ; i call it `` latent energy '' for obvious reasons",
    ". the identification of the latent `` heat '' with the bag constant is well - known in coulomb bag models @xcite .",
    "this can be considered just before the cosmological qcd phase transition which took place - at the moment the energy components which we should take into consideration .",
    "as time went on , the universe expanded and the temperature cooled further - from the critical temperature to the supercooling temperature ( @xmath215 with the fraction 0.95 in fact unknown ) and even lower , and then the cosmological qcd phase transition was complete .",
    "when the phase transition was complete , we should estimate how the energy @xmath216 is to be divided .",
    "let s assume that the qcd phase transition was completed at the point @xmath80 ( in fact maybe a little short after @xmath80 ) .",
    "let s take @xmath217 for simplicity .",
    "we would like to know how the energy @xmath216 is to be divided .",
    "first , we can estimate those remained with the baryons and other color - singlet objects - the lower limit is given by the estimate on the baryon number density ( noting that one baryon weighs about @xmath218 ) : @xmath219 so , in the volume @xmath220 or @xmath221 , we have at least @xmath222 baryons .",
    "one baryon has the volume energy ( i.e. the bag energy or the false vacuum energy ) @xmath223 ( which is @xmath224 ) .",
    "so , in the volume @xmath220 , we have at least @xmath225 or @xmath226 in baryon bag energy . or , in different units @xmath227 @xmath228 or @xmath229 .",
    "_ only a tiny fraction of @xmath216 is to be hidden in baryons or other color - singlet objects after the qcd phase transition in the early universe_.    so , where did the huge amount of the energy @xmath216 go ? in the beginning of the end of the phase transition , the pasted domain walls with the huge kinetic energies seem to be the main story .",
    "a pasted domain wall is forming by colliding two domain walls while eliminating the false vacuum in between .",
    "the kinetic energies associated with the previously head - on collision become vibration , center - of - mass motion , etc .",
    "of course , the pasted domain walls would evolve much further such as through the decaying interactions given earlier or forming the `` permanent '' structures . in any case , the total energy involved is known reasonably - a large fraction of @xmath216 , much larger than the radiation @xmath77 ( with @xmath66 negligible at this point ) .",
    "the story is relatively simple when the cosmological qcd phase transition was just completed and most `` pasted '' domain walls still have no time to evolve",
    ". we return to eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ( i.e. einstein equations ) for the master equations together with the equation of state with @xmath20 and @xmath21 determined by the energy - momentum tensor : @xmath230 further analysis indicates that the equation of state for the `` pasted '' or `` patched '' domain walls is nothing unusual - the reason is that we are working in the real four - dimensional space - time and all of the objects are of finite dimensions in all the directions .",
    "the `` domain walls '' discussed by us are for real and can not be stretched to infinity in a certain dimension .",
    "in fact , there is certain rule which one can not escape .",
    "let assume a simple equation of state , @xmath231 , for simplicity and come to look at eq .",
    "let s consider the situation in which there is no curvature @xmath35 and the cosmological constant @xmath131 is not yet important . @xmath232 which yields @xmath233 with @xmath234 .",
    "from the equation of continuity , @xmath235 , it is easy to obtain @xmath236 .",
    "thus , we deduce that , under very general situations , the density behaves like @xmath237 where the constant @xmath238 is related to @xmath239 in the simplified equation of state .",
    "it is clear that the limit to @xmath240 ( the cosmological constant ) is a discontinuity .",
    "of course , eq . ( 4 ) is still valid : @xmath241 this has an important consequence - the idea of the previous universe expansion usually based on the radiation alone from @xmath242 ( after the cosmological electroweak phase transition had taken place ) to @xmath243 ( when it was close that @xmath244 ) has to be modified because the latent energy @xmath216 was about @xmath245 times the radiation energy at the moment of the cosmological qcd phase transition .    shown in fig .",
    "1 is our main result - even though it is a qualitative figure but it tells us a lot . at @xmath246 , where did the latent energy @xmath247 evolve into",
    "? we should know that the curve for @xmath77 , for massless relativistical particles , is the steepest in slope .",
    "the other curve for @xmath66 is the other limit for matter ( which @xmath248 ) . in this way",
    ", the latent energy is connected naturally with the curve for @xmath249 - in fact , there seems to be no other choice .",
    "remember that @xmath250 except the slope for different types of `` matter '' .",
    "coming back to eq .",
    "( 43 ) or ( 4 ) , we could assume for simplicity that when the cosmological qcd just took place the system follows with the relativistical pace ( i.e. @xmath251 ) but when the system over - stretched enough and had evolved long enough it was diluted enough and became non - relativistic ( i.e. @xmath248 ) .",
    "it so happens that in both cases the density to the governing equation , eq .",
    "( 43 ) or ( 4 ) , looks like @xmath250 although it is @xmath252 followed by @xmath253 .",
    "it is so accidental that what we call `` the radiation - dominated universe '' is in fact dominated by the latent energy from the cosmological qcd phase transition in the form of `` pasted '' or `` patched '' domain walls and the various evolved objects . in our case , the transition into the `` matter - dominated universe '' , which happened at a time slightly different from @xmath254 , occurred when all the evolutions of the pasted domain walls ceased or stopped . in other words , it is not the transition into the `` matter - dominated universe '' , as we used to think of .",
    "in fact , the way of thinking of the `` dark matter '' , or the majority of it , turns out to be very natural . otherwise , where did the @xmath255 content of our universe come from ?",
    "of course , one could argue about the large amount of the cosmological qcd phase transition .",
    "we believe that the curves in fig .",
    "1 make a lot of sense .    of course",
    ", one should ask what would happen before the cosmological qcd phase transition .",
    "it might not be the radiation - dominated .",
    "i believe that it opens up a lot of important and basic questions .",
    "to sum up , we tried to illustrate how to describe the qcd phase transition in the early universe , or the cosmological qcd phase transition .",
    "the scenario that some first - order phase transitions may have taken place in the early universe offers us one of the most intriguing and fascinating questions in cosmology .",
    "in fact , the role played by the latent `` heat '' or energy released in the process is highly nontrivial .    in this paper ,",
    "i take the wisdom that the qcd phase transition , which happened at a time @xmath256 or at the temperature of about @xmath2 and accounts for confinement of quarks and gluons to within hadrons in the true qcd vacuum , would be of first order .",
    "thus , it is sufficient to approximate the true qcd vacuum as one of degenerate @xmath3-vacua and when necessary we try to model it effectively via a complex scalar field with spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "we examine how and how long `` pasted '' or `` patched '' domain walls were formed , how and how long such walls evolve further , and why the majority of dark matter might be accounted for in terms of these evolved objects .",
    "our central result could be summarized by fig .",
    "1 together with the explanations . mainly , we are afraid that the `` radiation - dominated '' epoch and the `` matter - dominated '' epoch , in the conventional sense , could not exist once the cosmological qcd phase transition took place",
    ". that also explains why there is the @xmath257 dark - matter content , larger than the baryon content , in our present universe .",
