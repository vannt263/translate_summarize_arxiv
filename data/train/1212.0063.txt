    "the wilsonian renormalization group approaches to the continuum quantum field theory have been formulated @xcite and developed in the past decades ( see reviews @xcite ) . in these approaches ,",
    "the renormalization group ( rg ) flow equation is defined by a functional differential equation , the solution of which gives the partition function defined by the functional integral . using this framework , we are able to obtain new approximation methods extracting the non - perturbative information of the partition function",
    ". therefore we call this type of the rg `` non - perturbative renormalization group '' ( nprg ) .    in order to solve the flow equation approximately ,",
    "we usually expand the equation in terms of the field operators and their derivatives .",
    "the derivative expansion has been applied to evaluation of the universal quantities such as critical exponents and anomalous dimensions .",
    "for example , in the three - dimensional scalar field theories , the expansion with respect to the field operator without the derivatives converges very well @xcite . although it is difficult to confirm the convergence with respect to the order of the derivatives , the result of the expansion up to the 4-th derivatives agrees well with the monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the nprg has been also applied to the analysis of the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( d@xmath0sb ) in the strong coupling gauge theories and its effective theory . as first noticed by nambu and jona - lasinio @xcite ,",
    "the scalar 4-fermi operators become the source of the d@xmath0sb . from the viewpoint of the nprg ,",
    "when we lower the renormalization scale of the effective action , the strong gauge interactions induce the effective 4-fermi operators , which bring about the d@xmath0sb at the low energy scale @xcite . unless there are explicit symmetry breaking terms such as mass terms",
    ", the running 4-fermi coupling constant diverges at a low energy scale .",
    "this explosive behavior is nothing but a signal of the d@xmath0sb  @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", the ( improved ) ladder schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation has been frequently used for the analysis of the d@xmath0sb  in the strong coupling gauge theories .",
    "this ladder approximation has the strong dependence on the gauge - fixing parameter .",
    "moreover it is difficult to improve the ladder approximation systematically .",
    "however the framework of nprg allows us to take account of the effects of the non - ladder diagrams in a systematic fashion @xcite .",
    "since the running 4-fermi coupling constants diverge at a critical scale as mentioned above , the rg flow can not go beyond the critical scale towards the infrared limit . in the simple framework of nprg which maintains the chirally symmetric structure of the effective action",
    ", we can not evaluate the physical quantities in the broken phase such as the dynamical mass of the fermion and the condensates of the fermion bilinear composite operator .    to overcome this problem",
    ", we introduce the bare mass term , which also works as a source term of the chiral condensates @xcite .",
    "we may expect that the bare mass prevents the divergent behavior of the 4-fermi coupling constants and might allow us to effectively evaluate the order parameter of the d@xmath0sb  at the infrared limit scale .",
    "the field operator expansion of the nprg equation , however , does not converge well at least in the region of the bare mass as small as the current masses of up and down quarks .",
    "consequently we will take another way of directly solving the nprg flow equation as a partial differential equation ( pde ) without relying on any field operator expansion .    by the way , another method like the hubbard ",
    "stratonovich transformation has been used in many works to avoid the divergent behavior @xcite . in this method , the composite operators of fermions are partially transformed to scalar fields , one of which obtains the nonzero expectation value as a chiral order parameter .",
    "introduction of those scalar fields has a merit that the meson physics can be argued simultaneously .",
    "however it is more complicated to evaluate the convergence of the physical quantities with respect to the operator expansion including the scalar fields .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .  2 we briefly review the flow equation for the effective average action .",
    "we introduce the basic truncation which projects the complete operator space onto the subspace relevant to the d@xmath0sb so as to solve the flow equation approximately . in sec .",
    "3 we examine the truncation method in detail and obtain two types of truncations : one corresponds to the ladder approximation , and the other contains the main parts of the non - ladder corrections . in sec .",
    "4 we explain how to evaluate the chiral order parameters . in sec .  5",
    ", we solve the flow equation by using the field operator expansion , and examine the convergence of chiral order parameters . in sec .  6 , we directly solve the partial differential equation and show the results of physical quantities . in sec .",
    "7 , we summarize our methods and results , and discuss further issues along the line of thought of this article .",
    "in order to evaluate non - perturbative effects of the quantum field theory , we introduce the so - called `` effective average action '' @xcite that interpolates between the bare action and the full quantum effective action . for this purpose , we define the generating function with the infrared cutoff supplied by the cutoff term @xmath1 $ ] as follows : @xmath2}&\\equiv z_\\lambda[j]:=   \\int\\ ! \\mathcal{d}\\omega   e^{-s_{\\rm bare}[\\omega]-\\delta s_\\lambda[\\omega ]   + \\int\\ ! j\\cdot \\omega},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 represents various fields generically and the functional integral is regularized by the ultraviolet ( uv ) momentum cutoff @xmath4 . the cutoff term @xmath5 is defined as the following mass term depending on the momentum : @xmath6&=\\int_p \\frac{1}{2}\\omega^t(-p)\\cdot r_\\lambda(p)\\cdot \\omega(p).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the regulator function @xmath7 suppresses the quantum fluctuations with the momentum lower than the infrared cutoff @xmath8 .",

    "this flow equation is firstly derived by wetterich @xcite .",
    "because of the boundary condition ( [ eq - boundary_cond . ] ) , the flow equation interpolates between the bare action @xmath17 and the full quantum effective action @xmath18 .",

    "this truncated subspace of the complete effective action is spanned by the operators of the bare qcd action and the fermion self - interaction operator @xmath26 , which we call the fermion potential .",
    "the discarded operators including higher derivatives or gluon fields may affect quantitative evaluation , but are not the essential sector to drive the d@xmath0sb .",
    "actually we will confirm that the operators of the bare qcd and the fermion potential bring about d@xmath0sb using the nprg flow equation @xcite .    here",
    "it should be noted that the flow equation induces operators breaking the gauge symmetry , such as the mass operator of the gauge boson , because the cutoff function explicitly breaks the gauge symmetry .",
    "however we do not discuss this issue because we truncate out such operators .",

    "therefore we have to take into account of the infinite number of the @xmath115-fermi operators , and encounter the infinite tower of the coupled rg equations .",

    "it also shows that the mass is dynamically generated by the d@xmath0sb since the infrared running mass is much larger than the corresponding bare mass . in the small bare mass region , however , the truncated solutions do not converge but diverge more badly for larger truncation order .",

    "note that the expansion around non - zero point means that the fermion potential @xmath133 is evaluated at the non - zero point , @xmath134 . in these methods , however , the field operator expansion does not converge in the small value region of the bare mass or the expansion point , and we can not obtain reliable chiral limit of the dynamical mass .",
    "obviously the poor convergence of the field operator expansion originates from the divergent behavior of the 4-fermi coupling constant , which corresponds to the second derivative of the fermion potential @xmath133 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the flow equation is solved as a partial differential equation ( pde ) , the fermion potential is expected to behave analytically at least except for the origin .",
    "therefore , we will directly solve the flow equation as a pde without the field operator expansion .    in the practical calculation",
    "we solve the flow equation in terms of the mass function , @xmath135 , because the numerical solution of the pde for the mass function is more stable than that for the fermion potential .",

    "it looks perfect and this is nothing but what we expected to get by adding the crossed gluon diagrams to go beyond the ladder . on the other hand , such great improvement by the non - ladder calculation is not seen for the dynamical mass .",

    "we have obtained the chiral order parameters successfully without any instability or extrapolation .    as for the chiral condensates , we have seen that the gauge dependence of the non - ladder extended result almost disappeared .",
    "therefore our non - ladder extended approximation almost respect the gauge invariance .",
    "a next step for further improvement of approximation would be to take into account of higher order operators including the first derivatives .",
    "this improvement is implemented by replacing the coefficient of the kinetic term @xmath159 with the function of @xmath57 , @xmath160 .",
    "consequently we need to solve coupled partial differential equations in terms of the fermion potential @xmath133 and the kinetic function @xmath160 .",
    "also we have seen that particularly in the landau gauge the gauge dependent ladder result of the chiral condensates coincides with the almost gauge independent non - ladder extended one .",
