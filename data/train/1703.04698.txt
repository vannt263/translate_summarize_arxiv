    "control of quantum conservative ( hamiltonian ) systems has been extensively studied in the last few decades from both theoretical and interdisciplinary points of view @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a growing interest in control of open ( dissipative , non - hamiltonian ) quantum systems because of their applications to physics , chemistry and quantum computing . for example",
    "there has been interest in the control of the rotation of a molecule in the gaseous phase by using laser fields in dissipative media @xcite . here",
    "the dissipation is due to molecular collisions and the dimension of the hilbert space describing the states of the system ( infinite - dimensional ) can be truncated to make the system finite - dimensional if the intensity of the laser field is sufficiently weak .",
    "other applications include control of the spin dynamics by magnetic fields in nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite and applications to the construction of quantum computers @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to study optimal control of two - level quantum systems in a dissipative environment , where we assume that the dissipation is markovian ( the dynamics depends only on the present state and not its history ) and time - independent . in this case",
    "the evolution for the density matrix of the system can by described by a quantum dynamical semi - group and the lindblad master equation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the state space for a _ closed quantum system _ is an @xmath0-dimensional projective hilbert space , @xmath1 , of a complex hilbert space @xmath2 .",
    "typically one drops the requirement of the space being projective , and instead , we work with unit vectors . to preserve the length of the vectors ,",
    "_ time evolution is unitary _ @xmath3 , and the evolution is described by the _ schrdinger equation _",
    "@xmath4 where @xmath5 is the hermitian hamiltonian . here",
    "the _ ket_-bracket describes the vector associated with an observable state .    the _ density operator _",
    ", @xmath6 , describes a probabilistic ensemble of states .",
    "it is given by a positive semi - definite hermitian operator @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the _ purity _ of a density operator describes how close @xmath6 is to a single state .",
    "it is usually defined as @xmath9}$ ] , where the unique operator that has a purity of @xmath10 is @xmath11 , called the _ completely mixed state . _ the dynamics for the purity operator",
    "is described by the _ von neumann equation _ @xmath12.\\ ] ] notice that this dynamical system preserves the purity of @xmath6 ( because the system is iso - spectral ) .",
    "a consequence is that if the quantum system is controlled by its hamiltonian , there is no controllability over its purity , since one can not directly alter the probabilities or achieve a purity of one .",
    "_ open quantum systems _ are quite different . for such systems dissipation occurs when we allow the system to interact with the environment .",
    "the full picture is an integro - differential equation called the nakajima - zwanzig ( nz ) equation . to make the dissipation purely of differential form ,",
    "one usually make two assumptions : the dissipation is markovian ( i.e. the dissipation only depends upon the current state , not past history ) and the dissipation is time - invariant .    under these assumptions , the dynamics of the density operator",
    "is given by the _ lindblad master equation _",
    "@xcite @xmath12+\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\left ( l_j\\rho l_j^{\\dagger } - \\frac{1}{2}\\left\\ { l_j^{\\dagger}l_j,\\rho\\right\\}\\right)\\ ] ] where the @xmath13 are called the lindblad operators , @xmath14 denotes the quantity of lindblad operators , and @xmath15 is the anti - commutator : @xmath16 .",
    "along the work we assume linblad operators are traceless .      in this paper",
    "we investigate the problem of minimum - time and minimum - energy global optimal control for dissipative open quantum systems whose dynamics is governed by the lindblad equation .",
    "our contributions here are two - fold",
    ". first we improve and extend the results for local optimality based on the steepest descent method studied in @xcite by obtaining global results on the bloch ball , which is the physical state space of the system .",
    "also we consider an energy - minimum optimal control problem , where the cost corresponds to the energy transfer between the control and the internal hamiltonian .",
    "the second contribution is related to work on generalizing the results given in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite with bounded controls to a class of control system with more general lindblad operators .",
    "the structure of the work is as follows : in section ii we introduce the lindblad equation and we interpret its dynamics as a control system in the bloch ball .",
    "section iii explains why the optimal control problem is singular and how to achieve maximum purity by suitable choice of initial conditions for the boundary value problem .",
    "sections iv and v are devoted to the study of time - minimum and energy - minimum controls for two- and three - dimensional systems .",
    "numerical results for time - minimum and energy - minimum controls in the previous two situations are explored in section vi .",
    "we conclude in section vii by outlining future research .",
    "an open quantum system is described by a density operator @xmath6 , which is a trace - one positive semi - definite hermitian operator on an @xmath0-dimensional complex hilbert space @xmath2 .",
    "if the dissipation is markovian and time independent , the density operator obeys the lindblad equation ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) @xmath17+\\mathcal{l}_d(\\rho),\\ ] ] with @xmath18 where @xmath14 denotes the quantity of lindblad operators , @xmath19 $ ] denotes commutator of matrices , @xmath5 is the hermitian hamiltonian , @xmath20 represents the hermitian transpose and @xmath21 are the lindblad operators .",
    "the purity of the system is defined as @xmath22 .",
    "the goal is to construct controls for the purity operator under lindblad dissipation . in most situations",
    "the controls appear in the hamiltonian @xmath5 , and not in the lindblad operator @xmath23 .",
    "this is the assumption we make here .    when @xmath24 , the density operator can be identified with a vector in the bloch ball ( the unitary sphere with its interior ) @xcite .",
    "under this special case , we can change the view from dynamics on operators to dynamics in the bloch ball by considering @xmath25 where @xmath26 ( i.e. , @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 is the @xmath29 identity matrix , and @xmath30 are the pauli matrices .    using this identification , we can reformulate the lindblad equation ( [ eq : master ] ) into a first - order dynamical system on the unit ball . using the derivation given in @xcite ( see appendix a therein ) , we have that is equivalent to @xmath31 where @xmath32 given that the bar represents the complex conjugate of matrices .",
    "the vectors @xmath33 , @xmath34 are the traceless parts of @xmath13 and @xmath5 respectively with @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the pauli matrices .",
    "notice that the matrix @xmath37 is positive semi - definite . from here on out , we will call the matrix @xmath38 to be @xmath39 .    here",
    "we would like to point out that the system reduces in special cases to those studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "setting one of the controls in our system to zero and identifying the parameters that appear in the system given in @xcite , @xcite with the elements of the matrix a , one obtains the system discussed in those papers .    as discussed above the control variables in the open quantum systems we discuss here",
    "appear in the hamiltonian operator as in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the controlled hamiltonian dynamics can not achieve a purity one @xcite and in general can not affect the purity of the state or transfer the states between unitary orbits . to control purity",
    "one must use the dissipative dynamics to move between orbits as in @xcite and @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider _ unbounded _ controls @xmath40 which may take any value in @xmath41 .    as long as @xmath42 is not at the origin , it can be shown that equation can be written in terms of the radial component ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that the purity @xmath44 is equal to @xmath45 , where @xmath43 .",
    "so , controlling the purity is synonymous with controlling the magnitude of the bloch vector .",
    "it is be helpful to extract the dynamics for @xmath46 .",
    "knowing that @xmath47 , we find that @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the unit vector associated with @xmath42 , @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , @xmath51",
    "so , we can control the purity by controlling the orientation of the corresponding unit vector .",
    "hereafter we refer to @xmath52 as _ the purity derivative_.    our goal is to find a control scheme that optimally transports the completely mixed state to a state of maximal purity .",
    "this raises two questions : what is the maximal achievable purity ? and , what do we mean by optimal ? . to answer these questions",
    "we will introduce in the next section the notion of _ apogee _ and _ escape chimney _ as in @xcite .",
    "the purity derivative ( [ eq : redial ] ) is independent of the controls used .",
    "it is illuminating to examine the regions in the bloch sphere where the purity derivative is positive . to do this , we examine the zeros of @xmath53 . define two sets , @xmath54 and the ellipsoid @xmath55 .",
    "to find @xmath56 , we define a new function @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "finding the roots of @xmath59 will let us solve for @xmath56 in spherical coordinates .",
    "@xmath60 so , the nonzero root is @xmath61 notice that @xmath62 is always defined since @xmath39 is negative - definite , and also note that the maximum of @xmath62 must be bounded by @xmath63 , so the bloch ball is invariant under ( [ eq : bloch ] )",
    ". + define @xmath64 to be _ the apogee _ of the ellipsoid @xmath56 .",
    "i.e. @xmath65 which can be found by maximizing on @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , the apogee of the ellipsoid @xmath56 will be the state with the maximal achievable purity .",
    "we call the interior of the ellipsoid @xmath67 the _ escape chimney_.    in figure 3 , in section vi - b , we show a picture of the escape chimney inside the bloch ball where the black square is the apogee and the trajectories represents energy minimum and time minimum control for initial conditions near the origin of the bloch ball and final conditions at the apogee .",
    "the optimal control problem consists of finding a trajectory of the state variables , starting at the completely mixed state ( i.e. , @xmath68 ) and ending at the apogee .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the dynamics ( [ eq : redial ] ) has a singularity at the origin since @xmath69 as well as the fact that the apogee can not be reached in finite time since it is not possible to reach equilibrium points in finite time .",
    "note that the purity derivative is independent of controls , so that , for a given path the purity derivative is an autonomous first order dynamical system that can not reach its fixed point .    to circumvent these problems , we take the following boundary conditions representing initial and final states @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 sufficiently small .    therefore , we can now state the optimal control problem studied in this work as follow : let @xmath73 be a cost functional dependent on the state as well as the controls .",
    "the optimal control problem consists of finding a control , @xmath74\\rightarrow u$ ] satisfying the dynamics ( [ eq : redial ] ) such that @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 in this work we study two different optimal control problems depending on the cost functional we choose : a _ time - minimal optimal control problem _ ( @xmath78 ) and an _ energy - minimal optimal control problem _ ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "in the special case when @xmath80 in ( [ eq : lindblad ] ) , that is , only one lindblad term ; @xmath81 becomes an eigenvector of @xmath39 .",
    "this fact lets us simultaneously diagonalize @xmath39 and rotate @xmath81 into the first coordinate . by additionally taking @xmath82 ,",
    "the third component of @xmath42 in equation becomes uncontrolled and exponentially decays to zero .",
    "dropping this coordinate , our system collapses to a two - dimensional underactuated bi - linear control system : @xmath83 where @xmath84 , @xmath85 are the coefficients of the matrix @xmath37 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "we want to find ( unbounded ) controls that steer ( [ eq : twodimenions ] ) with end points ( [ eq : startandend ] ) in the minimal amount of time possible .",
    "i.e. find a minimal solution to the functional @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 . to find @xmath91 ,",
    "see @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "so we wish to minimize a functional with integrand @xmath94 this lagrangian is not hyperregular , so the euler - lagrange equations will fail to yield meaningful results @xcite . to get around this problem , we implement the rayleigh - ritz numerical algorithm @xcite .",
    "we assume @xmath95 is a sum of linearly independent functions @xmath96 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",
    "specifically , we will take the following functions as a basis of polynomials for our approximation .",
    "@xmath100 with @xmath101 an arbitrary integer .",
    "then , a necessary condition for our guess to minimize the functional is for the following @xmath101 equations to hold @xmath102 this can be done by symbolically computing @xmath103 in matlab and numerically integrating using a @xmath104 order runge - kutta method . in order to find the optimal values to the @xmath105 s , we construct a new function @xmath106 which we use matlab s ` fminsearch ` function to find a root to @xmath107 .      for this , we want to minimize the following functional : @xmath108 to make independent of @xmath34 , we note the relation @xmath109 which , solving for @xmath34 , gives @xmath110 substituting into gives the integrand @xmath111 this problem can be solved by the rayleigh - ritz method as explained in the time - minimal section .",
    "next , instead of considering @xmath80 we allow an arbitrary number of lindblad operators @xmath14 .",
    "we want to find optimal controls for the system with boundary values given by where @xmath112^t$ ] is in the bloch ball , that is @xmath113 .",
    "this situation is similar to the two - dimensional case .",
    "all we need to do is modify to @xmath114which can be solved with the same algorithm to the two - dimensional case with the following form @xmath115 for @xmath116 , where we now have to solve for @xmath117 variables .",
    "we want to minimize the cost functional @xmath118 to solve this , we need to make independent of the @xmath119 s .",
    "this yields the following system of equations coming from equations : @xmath120 we consider @xmath121 and we drop the third equation in .",
    "one can alternatively choose @xmath122 or @xmath123 and the others two controls different to zero . denoting by @xmath124 , solving for @xmath125 and @xmath126 yields :    @xmath127    to minimize , we must use and ( along with @xmath121 ) , the guesses , and solve for the coefficients .",
    "we will work an example with parameter values @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "additionally , we will take @xmath132 .",
    "+ solving for the apogee in polar coordinates , we get @xmath133^t$ ] .",
    "figure @xmath63 shows a simulation of the trajectory for the @xmath134 order curve .",
    ".numerical results from time - minimal and energy - minimal controls with solutions of various orders .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , < , < , < , < \" , ]      order curves . the blue curve is the time - minimal curve and the red curve is the energy - minimal . additionally , the blue ellipsoid is the escape - chimney . ]",
    "[ figureball ]   order curves.,title=\"fig : \" ]    as before , we can also use and to determine what controls are required for the desired trajectory . since all the computations are done independent of time , we will report a plot of @xmath34 versus @xmath135 in figure [ fig:3d ] .",
    "order curves . ]",
    "an interesting feature of the 3-dimensional case is the graphical solutions are much closer than the results for the 2-dimensional case .",
    "another interesting observation is from fig .",
    "[ fig:2d ] where the controls approach different values as @xmath136 . in the time - minimal case ,",
    "if this value of @xmath34 is held constant and plugged into , then the ( stable ) fixed point of the system is precisely the apogee of the escape chimney .",
    "so under these controls , not only will we approach the apogee but we will also remain there .",
    "this also adds intuition to the time - minimal case : the optimal controls make the apogee the stable fixed point .",
    "now , for the three dimensional case , the controls do approach the same values at the endpoint as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:3d ] .",
    "these final controls , however , do not make the apogee the fixed point under i.e. @xmath138 and @xmath139 for both energy and time - minimal trajectories and @xmath140^t \\ne q_{apogee}$ ] .",
    "this situation will be studied in future work .",
    "we studied time - minimum and energy - minimum global optimal control problems for dissipative open quantum systems where the dynamics is described by the lindblad equation and controls are unbounded .",
    "we have transformed such a control system into a bi - linear singular control system in the bloch ball and have come up with the construction of a numerical algorithm to design optimal paths to achieve a desired point given initial states close to the origin of the bloch ball in both optimal control problems .",
    "all of the results presented are based on having fast control of the hamiltonian in , i.e. unbounded controls .",
    "it would be interesting to develop both time and energy - minimal control schemes where the control @xmath34 is bounded ( for example , @xmath141 .",
    "we are currently working on this problem building on the work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another problem in the bounded control setting is the fact that determining whether the apogee is asymptotically reachable is not clear .",
    "we hope to extend the results from @xcite to determine when the apogee is asymptotically reachable .",
    "extensions of our results to higher - order dimensional systems is another task to work based in this work .",
    "finally , it would also be interesting to determine the best basis of functions for the rayleigh - ritz methods as well as the best order of solutions to use ."
