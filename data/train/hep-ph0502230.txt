    "the intriguing phenomenon , the strong collinearity of cores in emulsion experiments  @xcite , closely related to coplanar scattering of secondary particles in the interaction , has been observed long time ago .",
    "so far there is no simple satisfactory explanation of these cosmic ray observations in spite of numerous attempts to find it ( see , for instance ,  @xcite and references therein ) . among them ,",
    "the jet - like mechanism  @xcite looks very attractive and gives the natural explanation of alignment of three spots along the straight line which results from momentum conservation in a simple parton picture of scattering .",
    "besides , the strong momentum correlation of particles inside a jet and correlation between jet axes due to singularity of qcd matrix elements allow us to suggest the high degree of alignment for more than 3 spots .",
    "this has been already demonstrated for the four cores in  @xcite but using a simplified picture of hadronization .",
    "with increasing energy of colliding hadrons ( nuclei ) hard and semi - hard jets begin to play an important role due to growth of their production cross sections .",
    "thus the jet activity is likely to be a feature of all events above certain threshold collision energy .",
    "one of the manifestations of this activity and the strict momentum ordering inside a hard enough jet can be the observed strong collinearity of spots in emulsion experiments .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is just to trace this relation in detail . in sect .",
    "2 we formulate the problem on the whole .",
    "section 3 describes the results of numerical simulation made under conditions close to emulsion experiments in the framework of pythia  @xcite , and some discussion .",
    "a summary can be found in sect .",
    "in the pamir experiment the observed events ( @xmath4-hadron families with the alignment ) are produced , mostly , by a proton with energy @xmath5 tev interacting at a height of several hundred metres to several kilometres in the atmosphere above the chamber  @xcite .",
    "the collision products are observed within a radial distance up to several centimetres in the emulsion where the spot separation is of the order of 1 mm .",
    "one can estimate the typical transverse momentum in the events under consideration using the ratio ( see also ( [ position ] ) ) : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the energy deposition in the spot , @xmath8 is its spacing in the @xmath9-ray film , @xmath10 is the height of interaction .",
    "so @xmath11 is of the order of 10 gev for @xmath12 mm , @xmath13 km , @xmath14 tev .",
    "the particles with such transverse momenta can be typically initiated by a jet with @xmath15 gev or larger , since the most probable value of a fraction of jet energy carried by leading particles is @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "such energetic jets are already enough collimated : their effective angular cone size @xmath17 due to the strict ordering of transverse and longitudinal particle momenta in the leading logarithm approximation of perturbative qcd  @xcite .",
    "qcd  teaches \" us also that this effective size decreases with the growth of the  jet hardness \" ( transverse momentum ) as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the dimensional qcd parameter .",
    "the main conjecture is that the particle distribution from the hard enough jets in the @xmath9-ray film plane can lead to the alignment of the emulsion spots due to the strong collimation of such particles and dynamical correlation between jet axis directions .",
    "let us consider the kinematics in detail .",
    "for our analysis it is convenient to parametrize 4-momentum of each produced particle @xmath20 under consideration with its transverse momentum @xmath21 ( relative to the collision axis @xmath22 ) , azimuthal angle @xmath23 and rapidity @xmath24 in the center - of - mass system : @xmath25.\\ ] ] in this case the transformation from the center - of - mass system to the laboratory one reduces to a simple rapidity shift : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 are the rapidities of particle @xmath20 and the center - of - mass system correspondingly in the laboratory reference frame . if we neglect the further interactions of particles propagating through the atmosphere ( this gives the maximum estimation of the alignment effect ) , then their position in the transverse @xmath29-plane is easily calculated @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the radial and longitudinal components of particle velocity respectively ( @xmath33 is the particle energy in the laboratory frame ) .",
    "since the size of the observation region is of the order of several centimetres , these radial distances must obey the following restriction : @xmath34 @xmath35 we set @xmath36 mm ,   @xmath37 mm .",
    "the restriction ( [ mini ] ) simply means that spots are not mixed with the central one formed by the particles which fly close to the collision axis ( mainly from the fragmentation region of an incident proton ) .",
    "the separation of spots in the @xmath9-ray film gives another restriction on the distance between particles @xmath38 it must be larger than 1 mm : @xmath39 in the opposite case the particles must be combined in one particle - cluster until there remain only particles and/or particle - clusters with the mutual distances larger than @xmath40 , each such particle - cluster being considered as a single particle with coordinates defined in the same way as center - of - mass coordinates of two bodies : @xmath41 then we select @xmath42 clusters / particles which are most energetic and obey the restrictions ( [ mini ] , [ max ] , [ dijres ] ) and calculate the alignment @xmath43 using the conventional definition  @xcite : @xmath44 and taking into account the central cluster , i.e. @xmath45 . here @xmath46 is the angle between two vectors ( @xmath47 ) and ( @xmath48 ) ( for the central spot @xmath49 ) .",
    "this parameter characterizes the location of @xmath50 points just along the straight line and varies from @xmath51 to @xmath52 .",
    "for instance , in the case of the symmetrical and close to most probable random configuration of three points in a plane ( the equilateral triangle ) @xmath53 .",
    "the ultimate case of perfect alignment is @xmath54 when all points lie exactly along the straight line , while for an isotropic distribution @xmath55 .",
    "the alignment degree @xmath56 is defined as a fraction of events with @xmath57  @xcite with the number of cores not less than @xmath50 .",
    "if the hypothesis about the relation of alignment to the prevailing jet character of events at super high energies is valid , then this must manifest itself first of all in nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "therefore , to be specific we consider a collision of two protons and fix a primary energy in the laboratory system @xmath58 tev , that is equivalent to @xmath59 tev  just the energy attainable at lhc ( the rapidity shift being @xmath60 after the transformation from the center - of - mass system to the laboratory one ) . to simulate a collision of two protons with such energies we use the monte carlo generator pythia  @xcite , which basically well describes jet events in hadron - hadron interactions and is tuned using the available experimental accelerator data .",
    "the results of numerical simulation which follows the consideration in the previous section are presented in fig .",
    "1 ( solid curve ) with the parameters @xmath61 mm , @xmath62 mm , @xmath63 m , which are close to the conditions of emulsion experiments , with the additional restriction on the energy threshold of particle registration in the emulsion : @xmath64 tev .",
    "the estimated alignment degree @xmath56 for @xmath50 cores is considerably larger than that for randomly selected chaoticly located spots in the @xmath9-ray film , but is still too small ( by a factor of 34 ) to describe the experimental data  @xcite even taking into account their large errors .",
    "this can mean that the jet activity is not sufficient at such energies or the jet mechanism can not , in principle , give the large experimentally observable alignment .    in order to try to answer this question",
    "let us consider the influence of the applied restrictions ( [ mini ] , [ max ] ) ( the laboratory acceptance criterion ) on the spectrum of particles selected to calculate the alignment . for particles with high enough transverse momenta @xmath21 relative to their masses",
    "@xmath65 these conditions ( [ mini ] , [ max ] ) reduce , mainly , to the restriction on the available particle rapidities in the center - of - mass system : @xmath66 @xmath67 since in this case @xmath68 for @xmath69 , where @xmath70 due to the kinematical restriction  @xcite , @xmath71 a production of harder jets with larger rapidities becomes possible with the growth of @xmath72 .",
    "the rapidity region ( [ mini1 ] , [ max1 ] ) just corresponds to the transition from soft to hard qcd physics , where the jet activity _ could _ manifest itself .    here",
    "one should note that ultrarelativistic particles ( @xmath73 ) are detected in the @xmath9-ray film from the restricted rapidity region ( [ mini1 ] , [ max1 ] ) which excludes such configurations as back - to - back hard jets with rapidities close to zero in the center - of - mass system .",
    "but just such configurations with scattering of hard partons at angles close to @xmath74 in the considered hadronic center - of - mass system ( which in this case practically coincides with the partonic center - of - mass system ) can be expected to be responsible for the alignment phenomenon .",
    "the point is that leading particles from both these hard jets have quantitatively comparable energies in the laboratory frame together with the `` strong memory '' of scattering plane .",
    "meanwhile leading particles from any other back - to - back hard jets with the relatively large modulo rapidities @xmath75 in the partonic center - of - mass system have essentially different laboratory energies due to lorentz boost . and the energy distinction is mainly determined by the value of @xmath76 . in the latter case particles from a forward",
    "hard jet produce as a rule the most energetic clusters ( apart from the central one ) in the laboratory frame , even if the particles from a backward ( in the partonic center - of - mass system ) jet hit the detection region .",
    "however such most energetic clusters from one jet are less correlated with the primary scattering plane and therefore will not be much aligned as clusters from both hard jets .",
    "this argumentation is confirmed by our simulation .    in this connection",
    "it is necessary to comment on the work  @xcite in which the jet hypothesis has been suggested for the first time for the explanation of alignment phenomenon .",
    "there the high degree of alignment has been demonstrated for the four cores only , using a simplified picture of fragmentation process .",
    "in fact , an axis distribution has been calculated in the partonic center - of - mass system in the first order of perturbative qcd theory at the partonic level , considering three partons in the final state only .",
    "then the lorentz transformation has been done in order to find their directions and localizations with respect to the central spot in the laboratory frame , considering each parton - jet as one long - living system ( the fragmentation time is of the order of flight time ) with some effective mass and aggregate group velocity .",
    "the velocity has been fixed ( @xmath77 in  @xcite ) so as to be able to include the events giving the high degree of alignment and corresponding to the two final - state parton - jets in the backward hemisphere and one in the forward hemisphere in the partonic center - of - mass system . in our variables",
    "this means that a mass factor @xmath78 must be very small for a such massive system ( @xmath79 ) so that it hits the detection region even with negative rapidities ( i.e. corresponds to the backward hemisphere in the partonic center - of - mass system ) , if one uses the same boost parameters as for the hadronic center - of - mass system without taking into account the possible additional boost due to the distinction between these partonic and hadronic frames .",
    "note that for real particles , e.g. @xmath80-mesons which mainly contribute to the multiplicity , this mass factor becomes significant for very small transverse momenta , @xmath81 gev , only .",
    "however , as our investigation shows , falling of appropriately correlated particles into the observation region is still not sufficient to obtain the high degree of alignment because of the energy selection procedure , if the total number of particles is large and they generate many distinctly separated spots .    for completeness one should also mention that high transverse momentum jet production has a connection to the double - core configuration of cosmic - ray events as it has been pointed out in  @xcite . under certain conditions a hard forward ( in the partonic center - of - mass system )",
    "jet together with a central bunch gives two relatively far separated clusters with large energies .",
    "the detailed studies of double - core ( or binocular ) phenomena with estimations of event rates and average lateral spread of the @xmath4-family using a pqcd based monte carlo can be found , for instance , in  @xcite .",
    "ultrarelativistic particles from the central rapidity region in the hadronic center - of - mass system ( as possible sources of appropriately correlated spots ) can hit the observation region owing to the decrease of @xmath82 _ only _ , i.e. the decrease of the height @xmath10 of primary interaction or the increase of the rapidity @xmath28 of the center - of - mass system due to the growth of energy @xmath72 , as it follows from ( [ r0 ] ) .",
    "the energy growth seems preferable , if we intend to be closer to emulsion experiments and increase the jet activity .",
    "however this demands the extrapolation of pythia parameters and their special tuning to the experimentally untested energy domain .",
    "updating can be done appropriately after the lhc operation starts .",
    "moreover at present this generator already uses the extrapolation of experimentally tested cross sections and structure functions to the lhc energy region @xmath59 tev in order to estimate the effects expected at such energies .    for illustration",
    "we utilize the first `` less dangerous '' alternative  decrease the interaction height by a factor of @xmath83 rather than increase the energy @xmath72 by the same factor of @xmath83 at the initial height so that particles from both hard jets ( with back - to - back structure ) , hitting the registration region , come from some rapidity range near @xmath84 including adjoint positive and negative values . in this case",
    "the alignment degree becomes strongly dependent on the minimum transverse momentum of hard process , @xmath85 , which is a parameter of pythia . at the height @xmath13 km",
    "such dependence was not visible , although we might catch some marginal tendency of the alignment degree to grow with the increase of @xmath85 at that height .",
    "however without the restriction on @xmath85 from below ( minimum bias ) the result coincides practically with one obtained earlier ( solid curve in fig .",
    "1 ) that shows some general characteristics of jet structure of events . if @xmath86 tev , particles from these hard jets together with particles flying close to @xmath22-axis ( within the transverse radius @xmath87 mm ) result in the alignment degree ( dashed curve ) comparable with the experimentally observed one  @xcite .",
    "thus the jet - like mechanism can , in principle , attempt to explain the results of emulsion experiments .",
    "for such an explanation it is necessary ( but not sufficient ) that particles from both hard jets ( with rapidities near @xmath84 in the center - of - mass system ) hit the observation region .",
    "this is possible at the relatively small height @xmath88 m and @xmath59 tev ; or at the height @xmath63 m , but the considerably higher energy @xmath89 tev ; or at some reasonable and acceptable intermediate combination of @xmath10 , @xmath72 and @xmath90 which meets the following condition : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the proton mass .",
    "@xmath93 is needed in order to have particles with @xmath94 that hit the detection region ( see ( [ max1 ] ) ) .",
    "we verified the decisive significance of condition ( [ r00 ] ) to allow the observation of large degree of alignment and its dependence on the process hardness for the smaller energy @xmath95 tev ( where the prediction of pythia is quite adequate ) and the height @xmath96 m ( in accordance with ( [ r00 ] ) ) thereby confirming this peculiar kinematic `` scaling '' .    at @xmath97 tev jets carry away about half of the energy of colliding protons in the center - of - mass system due to the relationship in a parton picture @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is a fraction of proton energy carried by each interacting parton ( quark or gluon ) .",
    "the striking feature of such configurations in the @xmath9-ray film is approximate equality of energy deposition in the central and the rest most energetic clusters , that can be one of the physical guideline to select the events with very hard jets not only at the generator level ( simulation ) .",
    "if we simply apply the additional threshold on the minimum energy of detected clusters needed in the alignment analysis , then we still obtain neither the desirable selection of jet hardness nor the increase of the alignment degree .",
    "the small variation of resolution parameter @xmath40 does not provide the desirable effect also .",
    "however , introduction of another threshold on the total energy of all @xmath100 selected clusters @xmath101 ( without taking into account the energy deposition in the central cluster around @xmath102 ) , @xmath103 allows us to select the events with hard jets only in a `` natural '' physical way and to reduce the hypothesis to the really active mechanism .",
    "figure 2 shows that the alignment degree increases with the growth of @xmath104 ( the restriction on @xmath85 is absent at all ! ) , and it becomes large enough ( dashed curve ) and comparable with the experimentally observed one  @xcite above the threshold @xmath105 pev . though one should note that our estimations give still too steep dependence on @xmath50 as one can see in figs .",
    "1b , 2b from comparison of slopes of straight lines with the experimental behaviour .    to give the reader a feeling for the various measures of alignment we present in figs .",
    "3 and 4 the spatial distributions of most energetic clusters in the @xmath29-plane for a few generated events along with the corresponding values of @xmath43 .",
    "some spots are hardly visible because of their small sizes which are proportional to the cluster energies ( especially in the case @xmath106 ) or because they are outside a square @xmath107 mm@xmath108 mm ( but inside a circle @xmath12 mm ) as it sometimes happens in the case @xmath109 . besides for @xmath106 we can distinctly see three relatively large spots resulted from two hard jets and a central bunch .    here",
    "one should note that there was slightly other criterion for the selection of families for the analysis in the works of pamir collaboration : the families with the total energy of @xmath4-quanta larger than a certain threshold and at least one hadron present were selected and analyzed .",
    "the alignment becomes apparent considerably at @xmath110 pev ( the families being produced , mostly , by a proton with energy @xmath111 pev ) . since the adequate comparison of our estimations with experimental data is impossible without a full simulation of particle propagation through the atmosphere , taking into account the energy distribution of primary cosmic particles , etc .",
    ", then in order to demonstrate the possibility of appearance of high alignment degree due to the jet mechanism we restrict ourself to the simpler ( but as concerns physics essentially close to experiment ) criterion of selection over the total energy of all particles .",
    "these particles are mostly @xmath80-mesons , the neutrals among them being the main source of the detected @xmath4-quanta .",
    "it is natural that the threshold on the total energy of all particles must be larger than the similar threshold on the total energy of @xmath4-quanta at the same collision energy . for comparison",
    "we estimate also the alignment degree selecting only the most energetic @xmath4-quanta with their total energy larger than certain threshold @xmath112 ( fig .",
    "5 ) : @xmath113 the result is close to that obtained previously with the threshold imposed on the total energy of all particles .    besides for jet events @xmath114 with a high accuracy ( see figs .",
    "1b , 2b , 5b , which present the dependence of alignment degree on the number of considered cores at the different values of hardness parameter ( 1b ) and threshold total energy ( 2b , 5b ) in the logarithmic scale ) .",
    "this constant depends on @xmath85 , @xmath104 , @xmath112 , decreasing with their growth , and could in principle be determined by the kernels of the gribov ",
    "altarelli  parisi ",
    "dokshitzer equations  @xcite which describe the process of radiation of quarks and gluons in the initial and final states . and",
    ", in fact , this process is implemented in the pythia generator together with the subsequent hadronization of quarks and gluons .",
    "if nevertheless particles from the central rapidity region @xmath84 and the jet - like mechanism are insufficient to describe the observed alignment and there is another mechanism of its appearance at the energy @xmath115 tev and the height @xmath116 m ( mostly used in emulsion experiment estimations ) , then in any case some sort of alignment should arise at lhc too in the rapidity region ( [ mini1 ] , [ max1 ] ) .",
    "this region must be investigated more carefully on the purpose to study the azimuthal anisotropy of energy flux in accordance with the procedure applied in the emulsion and other experiments , i.e. one should analyze the energy deposition in the cells of @xmath117-space in the rapidity interval ( [ mini1 ] , [ max1 ] ) ( the equivalent threshold minimum particle energy being @xmath118 gev in the center - of - mass system ) .",
    "note that the absolute rapidity interval can be shifted : it is necessary only that the difference ( @xmath119 is equal to @xmath120 in accordance with the variation of radial distance by a factor of 15 ( @xmath121 ) due to the relationship @xmath122 ( independently of @xmath82 ) . in other words , since we use particle momenta in the center - of - mass system , then future data should be treated in accordance with the algorithm described earlier in sects . 2 , 3 introducing the corresponding laboratory observables .",
    "our analysis shows that for @xmath123-collision at a fixed height of primary interaction above the energy @xmath72 , when the condition ( [ r00 ] ) is fulfilled  that is ultrarelativistic particles from the rapidity interval near @xmath84 in the center - of - mass system fall into the observation region inside the radius @xmath90 in the laboratory frame due to the large lorentz factor  the alignment of spots arises ( this , in principle , explains the existence of the experimental energy threshold of this effect ) and the alignment degree becomes strongly dependent on the process hardness .",
    "if the process hardness is close to maximum for the given energy @xmath72 , the estimated degree of alignment is already comparable with the experimentally observed one . introducing another additional threshold (",
    "the scale of which is determined by the energy of an incident proton ) on the total energy of all @xmath100 selected most energetic clusters ( without taking into account the energy deposition in the central cluster ) allows us to select the events with high hardness in a ",
    "natural  physical way and thereby support the jet - like hypothesis , which later on may be accepted ( or refuted ) in further investigations of , for instance , the energy cluster distribution and their particle composition with regard for interactions in the atmosphere , etc .    meanwhile we suggest the more careful investigation of the rapidity region ( [ mini1 ] , [ max1 ] ) at lhc in order to reveal the new still unknown mechanisms of alignment if they exist . for this purpose one should perform the analysis of energy deposition in calorimeters of cms and atlas experiments in accordance with the procedure described in sects . 2 , 3 ( i.e. calculating the appropriate observables in the laboratory frame ) .",
    "such investigation can clarify the origin of the alignment , test the alternative hypotheses and give the new restrictions on the values of height and energy .",
