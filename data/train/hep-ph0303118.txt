    "it is well known that the correct degrees of freedom at high energy are not quarks or gluon but colour dipoles @xcite which have transverse sizes @xmath8 and the fraction of energy @xmath9 .",

    "comparison of the result of this paper with the dipole - dipole interaction in , so called , double log approximation @xcite shows that the bfkl dynamics does not change physics at large @xmath1 .",
    "the non - linear evolution equation at fixed @xmath1 was solved @xcite in the case when the bfkl kernel was replaced by the double log one .",
    "the solution leads to the answer in the saturation region with geometrical scale@xcite [ gescale ] n(x , r_1,t , r_2,t;b_t)= f(=r^2_1,tq^2_sat(x)e^-4m_b_t ) .",
    "therefore , we believe that for the bfkl dynamics will hold . this belief is based on the similarity between double log and bfkl approximation for @xmath0 processes .",

    "this research was supported in part by the gif grant @xmath190 i-620 - 22.14/1999 and by israeli science foundation , founded by the israeli academy of science and humanities .",
    "the integration over @xmath63 in can be taken explicitly @xcite and can be reduced to [ a1 ] d^2r_1v(r_1,t , r_1 ; ) v(r_1,t,|_1 -_t| ; -)= @xmath191    where @xmath192 is the hypergeometrical function ( see ref .",

    "@xcite ) , namely , [ a6 ] v(r_1,t , q ; ) = d^2r_1e^ i v(r_1,t , r_1 ; ) . it turns out @xcite that @xmath200    at small @xmath201 leads to the following behavior of vertex @xmath202 : [ a8 ] v(r-1,t , q ; ) | _",
    "q^2 0()^-i ( 1-(q^2)^2 i()^i 2 ) as have been discussed the matching with the born approximation occurs at @xmath203 . in this limit [ a9 ] v(r_1,t , q ; ) ( 1 - q^2 ) , which has correct analytical behavior",
    "actually this behavior dictates the choice of the coefficients @xmath195 and @xmath196 in and",
    ".    however , at @xmath204 the low @xmath201 behavior has a singularity @xmath205",
    ". therefore the symmetry of with respect to sign of @xmath76 is broken .",
    "mueller and tang @xcite pointed out that this problem can be cured by adding to the expression of @xmath206 of , namely , @xmath207 as was found@xcite such terms can be added due to gauge invariance of qcd . in momentum representation ( see ) @xmath208 can be written as a sum of three terms as it is shown in .",
    "the mueller - tang vertex leads to the born approximation amplitude in the form of .",
    "however , as was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , it has not been proven that this vertex will satisfy the bfkl equation .",
    "the solution in the form of has a different form of the born amplitude , namely , [ a10 ] n^ba ( ) ( ) .",
    "however , these two expressions for the born amplitude are equivalent due to gauge invariance of qcd @xcite .",
    "using we can calculate the dipole - dipole amplitude at @xmath209 and , therefore , the saturation scale with better accuracy than within . on the other hand the saturation momentum increases for @xmath210 .",
    "such an increase guarantees that approaches the amplitude given by in the region of low @xmath7 .",
