    "the idea of the electron - acoustic wave ( eaw ) has been conceived by fried and gould @xcite during numerical solutions of the linear electrostatic vlasov dispersion equation in a uniform unmagnetized plasma .",
    "it is basically an acoustic - type waves @xcite , in which inertia is provided by the cold electron mass , and the restoring force comes from the hot electron thermal pressure .",
    "the ions play the role of a neutralizing background only .",
    "the spectrum of the linear ea waves , unlike that of the well - known langmuir waves , extends only up to the cold electron plasma frequency @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the unperturbed cold electron number density , @xmath2 magnitude of the electron charge , and @xmath3 the mass of the electron .",
    "this upper wave frequency limit @xmath4 corresponds to a short - wavelength eaw and depends on the unperturbed cold electron number density @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the dispersion relation of the linear eaws in the long - wavelength limit [ in comparison with the hot electron debye radius @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the hot electron temperature , @xmath7 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath8 the unperturbed hot electron number density ] is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the wave number and @xmath11 the ea speed @xcite .",
    "besides the well - known langmuir and ion - acoustic waves , they noticed the existence of a heavily damped acoustic - like solution of the dispersion equation .",
    "it was later shown that in the presence of two distinct groups ( cold and hot ) of electrons and immobile ions , one indeed obtains a weakly damped eaw @xcite , the properties of which significantly differ from those of the langmuir waves .",
    "gary and tokar @xcite performed a parameter survey and found conditions for the existence of the eaws .",
    "the most important condition is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 @xmath14 is the temperature of cold ( hot ) electrons .",
    "the propagation characteristics of the eaws has also been studied by yu and shukla @xcite , mace and hellberg @xcite and mace _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "two - electron - temperature plasmas are known to occur both in laboratory experiments @xcite and in space environments @xcite .",
    "the propagation of the eaws has received a great deal of renewed interest not only because the two - electron - temperature plasma is very common in laboratory experiments and in space , but also because of the potential importance of the eaws in interpreting electrostatic component of the broadband electrostatic noise ( ben ) observed in the cusp of the terrestrial magnetosphere @xcite , in the geomagnetic tail @xcite , in auroral region @xcite , etc .",
    "the eaws have been used to explain various wave emissions in different regions of the earth s magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "it was first applied to interpret hiss - emissions observed in the polar cusp region in association with low - energy @xmath15 upward moving electron beams @xcite .",
    "the eaws were also utilized to interpret the generation of the ben emissions detected in the plasma sheath @xcite , as well as in the dayside auroral zone @xcite .",
    "@xcite rigorously studied the ben observed in the dayside auroral zone and showed that because of the very high electric field amplitudes @xmath16 involved , the nonlinear effects must play a significant role in the generation of the ben in the dayside auroral zone .",
    "_ @xcite also explained the short - duration @xmath17 burst of the ben in terms of electron acoustic solitary waves ( ea - sws ) : such ea - sws passing the satellite would generate electric field spectra . to study the properties of ea solitary structures ,",
    "dubouloz _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered a one - dimensional , unmagnetized collisionless plasma consisting of cold electrons , maxwellian hot electrons , and stationary ions . el - shewy @xcite has investigated the propagation of linear and nonlinear ea - sws in a plasma containing cold electrons , nonthermal hot electrons , and stationary ions .",
    "the effects of arbitrary amplitude ea - sws and electron - acoustic double layers ( ea - dls ) in a plasma consisting of cold electrons , superthermal hot electrons , and stationary ions has been considered by sahu @xcite .",
    "the ea - sws in a two - electrons - temperature plasma where ions form stationary charge neutral background has been observed by dutta @xcite .",
    "el - wakil _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered cold electrons , nonthermal hot electrons , and stationary ions , and studied the nonlinear properties of ea - sws by using time - fractional korteweg - de vries ( k - dv ) equation . on the other hand ,",
    "there are some space , where the energetic ions are observed , and ion - temperature can very high , even higher than electron - temperature @xcite .",
    "the energetic ions are described by a nonthermal or cairns _ et al .",
    "_ distribution @xcite , and are referred to as nonthermal ions .",
    "the latter is now being common feature of the geospace plasmas , and in general it is turning out to be a characteristic feature of space plasmas @xcite . for examples ,",
    "nonthermal ions are observed in the earth s bow - shock region by the vela satellite @xcite ; aspera on the phobos 2 satellite has observed the loss of energetic ions from the upper ionosphere of mars ; in solar active region @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the effect of non - thermal ( energetic or fast ) ions on small and large amplitude ea solitary pulses ( easps ) and ea - dls in a multi - component plasma .",
    "it is found that the presence of non - isothermal ions greatly affect the features of both easps and ea - dls .",
    "the latter can be identified as localized electrostatic excitations in observational data from space and laboratory plasmas .",
    "we consider the nonlinear propagation of the eaws in one - dimensional , collisionless , unmagnetized plasmas composed of cold electrons , hot electrons obeying a boltzmann distribution , and nonthermal ions following nonthermal distribution .",
    "thus , at equilibrium , we have @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the nonthermal ion number density at equilibrium",
    ". the nonlinear dynamics of the eaws propagating in such a plasma system is governed by    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the cold electron number density normalized by its equilibrium value @xmath1 , @xmath22 the cold electron speed normalized by @xmath23 , @xmath24 the wave potential normalized by @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 the ion temperature , and @xmath29 , in which @xmath30 is the nonthermal parameter @xcite .",
    "the time variable @xmath31 is in units of @xmath32 , and the space variable @xmath33 is normalized by @xmath34 .",
    "our three - component plasma model is valid for electrostatic disturbances with the eaw phase speed much larger ( smaller ) than the thermal speed of the cold electrons ( hot electrons and hot ions ) .",
    "the non - isothermal ion density distribution is associated with an ion distribution function that departs from the maxwell - boltzmann law on account of the ea wave amplitude dependent of the ion energy in the nonlinear regime .",
    "to derive an energy integral @xcite from eqs .",
    "( [ c])-([p ] ) , we first make all the dependent variables to depend only on a single variable @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the nonlinear wave speed normalized by @xmath23 . we note that @xmath36 is not the mach number , since it is normalized by @xmath23 , which is not the eaw phase speed .",
    "now , using the steady - state condition and imposing the appropriate boundary conditions ( namely , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 at @xmath40 , one can express @xmath21 as    @xmath41    now , substituting eq .",

    "the latter for our purposes reads    @xmath47    which is valid for the arbitrary amplitude easps and ea - dls in our plasma .",
    "we first investigate the properties of small amplitude easps and ea - dls by using a pseudo - potential approach @xcite .",

    "in this paper , we have considered a plasma composed of cold inertial electrons , hot boltzmann distributed electrons , and non - isothermal hot ions , and have investigated properties of small but finite , as well as arbitrary amplitudes easps and ea - dls .",
    "we have used the pseudo - potential approach , which is valid for arbitrary amplitudes easps and ea - dls .",
    "it has been found for the small amplitude limit that ( i ) the non - thermal plasma system under consideration is found to support easps and ea - dls , whose salient features ( the amplitude , the width , the speed , etc . )",
    "are significantly modified by the non - thermal parameter @xmath60 ; ( ii ) the amplitude ( width ) of the easps decreases ( increases ) with @xmath60 ; ( iii ) the amplitude ( width ) of the ea - dls decreases ( increases ) with @xmath60 . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been found for the arbitrary amplitude that ( i ) ea - dls are formed at @xmath69 ; ( ii ) positive easps are formed at @xmath70 ; ( iii ) no positive easps are formed at @xmath71 ; ( iv ) the negative easps are formed at @xmath63 ; ( v ) at @xmath83 the negative easps and positive easps or ea - dls coexist ; ( vi ) when ion temperature is greater than hot ion temperature i.e. @xmath81 then we get only negative easps .",
    "the ranges of different plasma parameters used in our investigation are very wide ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 ) , are relevant to both space @xcite and laboratory plasmas @xcite .",
    "thus , the results of the present investigation should help us to explain salient features of localized ea perturbations propagating in space and laboratory plasmas that have two distinct groups of electrons and a component of non - isothermal hot ions .",
