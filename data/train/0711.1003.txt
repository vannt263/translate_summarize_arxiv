    "the baryon - baryon interactions are basic issues in nuclear physics . in the past years",
    ", there has been a lot of work on the nucleon - nucleon interactions ( @xmath4 ) , for there exists much experimental information from nucleon - nucleon scattering .",
    "however , the interactions of hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath5 ) are much less known than these of @xmath4 due to the difficulties in performing scattering experiments with the unstable hyperons . in these @xmath5 interactions ,",
    "only the @xmath6 interaction is known for us by studying the hyper - nuclei .",
    "the hyperon - hyperon ( @xmath7 ) interactions are the least known ones in baryon - baryon interactions for the very scarce information in experiments .",
    "more studies of @xmath5 , @xmath7 interactions are needed not only by the development of the nuclear physics , but also by the application in the other fields , such as in astrophysics .",
    "there have been some typical models for the study of @xmath5 and @xmath7 interactions . such as the @xmath8 quark model @xcite , the @xmath9 chiral quark model @xcite , the chiral effective field theory @xcite , the lattice qcd @xcite , the chiral unitary approach @xcite , the meson - exchange model @xcite and the qcdsr @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will study the @xmath1 interactions with finite - density qcdsr , which had been developed in the series papers @xcite . with this approach ,",
    "the properties of nucleons , @xmath10- and @xmath0-hyperons in nucleonic nuclear matter have been reasonably described .",
    "based on the sum rules for @xmath11 interactions @xcite , the @xmath1 interactions can be described by substituting the in - medium condensates in nucleonic nuclear matter with pure @xmath0 matter , this approach has been adopted in our previous work , in which the @xmath10@xmath10 interactions were discussed @xcite .",
    "the finite - density qcdsr approach focuses on a correlation function of interpolating fields , made up of quark fields , which carry the quantum numbers of the hadron of interest .",
    "unlike usual ones , the correlation function is evaluated in the ground state of the nuclear matter rather than in vacuum .",
    "the correlation function can represent in a simple phenomenological ansatz for these spectral densities on the one hand . on the other hand ,",
    "the correlation function can be evaluated at large space - like momenta using an operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "finally , one can deduce the sum - rules by equating these two different representations using appropriately weighted integrals .",
    "the baryon self - energies in medium matter can be related to qcd lagrangian parameters and finite - density condensates .    for simplicity ,",
    "only the leading order of the in - medium condensates are taken into account in this work , which is a reasonable approximation at low nuclear densities @xcite . in the ope for @xmath0 correlation function",
    ", we consider all condensates up to dimension 4 , and the terms up to the first order in the strange quark mass @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , the contributions from the dimension-6 four - quark condensate are included for their importance . and",
    "the leading order in - medium gluon condensates , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are derived from the chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) . following the ref .",
    "@xcite , to deal with the determined scalar - scalar four - quark condensate @xmath18 , we introduce a arbitrary parameter @xmath19 to describe its density dependence .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the subsequent section ,",
    "the sum rules and the condensates are given .",
    "the calculations and analysis are presented in sec .",
    "[ result ] .",
    "section [ summary ] is a summary .",
    "the finite - density qcdsr approach has been well devolved in the series lectures @xcite .",
    "as done in @xcite , we can easily extent the @xmath0 sum rules in nuclear matter @xcite to describe the @xmath20 interactions in the pure @xmath0 matter by changing the quark and gluon condensates in nuclear matter to those in pure @xmath0 matter ( the sum rules are listed in appendix a ) . using the obtained sum rules , the baryon scalar self - energy @xmath21 and the vector self - energy @xmath22 and the effective mass @xmath23",
    "can be related to the in - medium quark and gluon condensates at finite - density .",
    "then , the @xmath1 nuclear potential @xmath2 can be valued by the formula @xmath24 .",
    "the essential quark and gluon condensates are calculated in the subsequent section .      to obtain the predictions for the @xmath1 interactions in pure @xmath0 matter from the sum rules described above , we need to know the condensates in pure @xmath0 matter .",
    "the first order of the condensates in the nuclear matter can be written as @xmath25 where the ellipsis denote the corrections of higher order density , and @xmath26 is the spin averaged @xmath0 matrix element .    as we know ,",
    "in the qcd hamiltonian density @xmath27 , chiral symmetry is explicitly broken by the current quark mass terms . neglecting the isospin breaking effects ,",
    "one has the hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath12 and @xmath29 are the strange and light @xmath30 current quark masses , respectively ; @xmath31 and @xmath32 stand for the @xmath30 quark and strange quark fields , respectively . taking the hamiltonian @xmath33 as a function of @xmath29 ,",
    "in the hellmann - feyman theorem , one obtains @xmath34 in the above equation , we consider the cases of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath36 denotes the ground state of @xmath0 matter with @xmath0 density @xmath37 and @xmath35 denotes the vacuum state .",
    "taking the difference of these two cases , and taking into account the uniformity of the system yields @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the energy density of the @xmath0 matter , which is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is of the higher order term .",
    "recently , the in - medium condensates are studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , from their analysis it is found that the contributions of the higher order term @xmath42 to the in - medium condensates are small at low density @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the contributions of the higher order term @xmath41 are neglected in the calculations . in the chiral perturbation theory ( see the appendix b of @xcite ) , the @xmath0 mass is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are real parameters in the chiral lagrangian , which can be seen in many references for example @xcite .",
    "then , from the eq .",

    "the other parameters , such as the vacuum condensates and the current quark masses , are adopted the same as those in our previous work @xcite .",
    "finally , the in - medium four - quark condensate , @xmath61 , should be considered justly , because they are numerically important in the finite density sum rules . as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , the in - medium four - quark condensates in the @xmath0 sum rules are their factorized forms , which may not be justified in nuclear matter because the four - quark condensates are sensitive to the nuclear density , one might suspect that this is an artifact of the factorization .",
    "thus , as done in refs .",
    "@xcite we choose to parameterize the scalar - scalar four quark condensates so that they interpolate between their factorized form in free space and their factorized form in @xmath0 matter .",
    "that is , in the calculations we need replace @xmath62 in eqs .",
    "( [ a1 ] , [ a2 ] ) by modified form @xmath63 : @xmath64 where @xmath19 is the real parameter . the predictions in refs .",
    "@xcite suggest that the four - quark condensate , @xmath62 , should depend weakly on the nuclear density .",
    "that is , the artificial parameter @xmath19 is most possibly in the range of @xmath65 .",
    "in the calculations , to quantify the fit of the left- and right- sides of the @xmath0 sum rules , we use the logarithmic measure @xcite    @xmath66.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 denote the right - hand sides of the eqs.([a1][a3 ] ) , respectively . in principle , this three terms are equal to @xmath70 .",
    "the predictions for @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath22 are obtained by minimizing the measure @xmath74 . in the zero - density density",
    ", we can obtain the @xmath0 mass in vacuum applying the same procedure to the sum rules .",
    "firstly , we should choose a proper borel mass @xmath75 in the calculation . in principle",
    "the predictions should be independent of the borel mass @xmath75 .",
    "however , in practice one has to truncate the operator product expansion and use a simple phenomenological ansatz for the spectral density , which cause the sum rules to overlap only in some limited range of @xmath75 .",
    "the previous studies for the octet baryons show that the sum rules do not provide a particulary convincing plateau .",
    "nevertheless , we can assume that the sum rules actually has a region of overlap , although it is imperfect . in order to compensate for at least some of the limitations of the truncated sum rules ,",
    "we normalize the finite - density predictions for all self - energies to the zero - density prediction for the mass . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the optimization region of @xmath75 is suggested as @xmath76 gev@xmath77 , thus , in this work we choose the proper borel mass @xmath75 around this region .    to find an optimization region for @xmath75 ( in this region the predictions should be less sensitive to @xmath75 than those in other regions ) , we plot the @xmath0 masses in vacuum and in nuclear medium as a function of borel mass @xmath75 in its possible range @xmath78 in fig .  [ pic - vac ] and fig .",
    "[ pic - m20.5 ] , respectively .",
    "it is found that by normalizing the finite - density predictions in the calculation , a good plateau appears in the range of @xmath79 .",
    "this optimal borel mass predicted by us consists with the previous predictions in refs .",
    "@xcite . in our later calculations ,",
    "we choose the medium value @xmath80 .",
    "then , the sensitivity of the predictions to the @xmath19 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ picf0.5 ] , where @xmath49 , @xmath82 and @xmath81 are fixed at 56 mev , 0.5 and 270 mev , respectively , as done in @xcite .",
    "the fig .",
    "[ picq0.5 ] is about the optimum results as a function of the momentum @xmath81 at the normal nuclear density @xmath83 with three different values of @xmath19 . from the figures",
    ", it is seen that the predictions for @xmath84 and @xmath85 are sensitive to @xmath19 ( i.e. the four - quark condensate ) but slightly dependent on @xmath81 , they monotonously increase with the increment of the @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath86 is insensitive to both the @xmath19 and @xmath81 .",
    "there are large uncertainties of the @xmath50 sigma term @xmath49 and the strangeness content of the nucleon @xmath82 .",
    "the recent determinations suggest large values for @xmath87 mev , and hence a large strangeness content of the nucleon , i.e. , @xmath88 are obtained .",
    "the @xmath11 sum rule study suggests large strangeness content @xmath88 , which is also in agreement with our recent predictions @xmath88 and @xmath8956 mev in the study of the @xmath90 interaction with qcdsr . while the usual adopted values of @xmath49 and @xmath82 is @xmath91 mev and @xmath92 . to study the effect of the parameters @xmath82 and @xmath49 , we plot @xmath84 and @xmath93 as functions of @xmath82 and @xmath49 , respectively , in fig .",
    "[ pic - y ] and fig .",
    "[ pic - sigma ] .    from the two figures",
    ", it can be seen that @xmath93 is insensitive to both y and @xmath49 .",
    "however , the scalar self - energy is sensitive to the strange quark content @xmath82 , and slightly depends on the @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath84 increases with the increment of the @xmath19 , however , decreases with the increment of the @xmath82 .",
    "finally , to study the in - medium properties of the @xmath0-hyperon , the effective mass @xmath84 , the vector self - energy @xmath94 and the potential @xmath86 as functions of densities @xmath37 are plotted . for the uncertainties of the @xmath49 and @xmath82 , two sets of the @xmath49 and @xmath82",
    "are adopted in this work .",
    "one set is the new determinations @xmath95 mev and @xmath88 ; and the other set is the usual values @xmath91 mev and @xmath96 .    from the figures [ aa ] and [ bb ] , we see the effective mass @xmath84 decreases , whereas the vector self - energy @xmath94 increases monotonously with the increment of the @xmath0 density . the differences of the effective mass @xmath84 between the parameter @xmath97 and @xmath98 are more and more obvious with the increment of the density @xmath37 , while the vector self - energy @xmath94 is insensitive to the parameter @xmath19 at different densities .    from the figure",
    ", we also find that the potential @xmath2 has strong parameter dependence in the whole density region @xmath99 .",
    "the differences between the two sets @xmath97 and @xmath98 become more and more obvious with the increment of the density .",
    "when we set @xmath95 mev , @xmath88 , and @xmath100 , the effective mass and vector self - energy at @xmath101 are @xmath102 in the range @xmath65 ( see fig . [ aa ] ) ; and the potential @xmath2 is strongly attractive , the strength increases monotonously with the increment of the @xmath0 density @xmath37 . at @xmath103 , the potential can reach to @xmath104 which is much stronger than the nuclear potential of nucleon at normal density . similarly , the attractive @xmath1 potential is also predicted in @xcite , which is even stronger than the @xmath4 one .    if we set @xmath91 mev , @xmath96 ( see fig .",
    "[ bb ] ) , it is seen that the effective mass @xmath84 , the vector self - energy @xmath94 at @xmath101 are @xmath105 and the potential is @xmath106 in this case , the medium value of the potential @xmath107 mev is also strongly attractive . comparing with the predictions of the two parameter sets , we find the vector self - energies of them are almost equal , however , the nuclear potential with @xmath108 mev are much weaker than that with @xmath109 mev .",
    "although the sum - rule predictions for the scalar self - energy are quite sensitive to the four - quark condensates in nuclear medium and parameter @xmath82 , according to the analysis of the four - quark condensates in the series papers , we could predict that the @xmath1 potential is most likely strongly attractive .",
    "this potential is much stronger than the @xmath90 potential @xcite in the same conditions .",
    "thus , when we deal with the strange nuclear matter , if many @xmath0 hyperons appear , the interactions between @xmath0 hyperons should play crucial roles . according to our predictions ,",
    "the bound state of double-@xmath0 maybe exist .",
    "in this paper , the @xmath1 interactions are analyzed carefully with the finite - density qcdsr approach .",
    "the sum - rule analysis indicates that the vector self - energy @xmath22 is insensitive to the sum rule parameters .",
    "however , the potential @xmath2 and the scalar self - energy @xmath21 have strong parameter dependence , especially , they are very sensitive to the four quark condensates .",
    "although the predictions strongly depend on the undetermined parameters @xmath19 and @xmath82 , it can predict that the @xmath1 potential @xmath2 is most likely strongly attractive , which could be @xmath3 mev or even more attractive at normal nuclear density .",
    "if this prediction is the case , the interactions between @xmath0 hyperons should play crucial roles in the strange nuclear matter , when there are multi-@xmath0 hyperons .",
    "the bound state of double-@xmath0 maybe exist .",
    "this is a preliminary attempt to study the @xmath1 interactions in finite @xmath0 density .",
    "more studies are needed to describe the details of the potential .",
