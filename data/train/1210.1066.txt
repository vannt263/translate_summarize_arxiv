    "the first step of the standard solution to bayesian testing of the point - null ( or sharp , or precise ) hypothesis @xmath2 is to assign a prior probability to the hypothesis .",
    "this is necessary if one wishes to use e.g. tests based on bayes factors , as an absolutely continuous prior for @xmath3 would yield @xmath4 regardless of the data @xmath5 .",
    "we shall refer to this procedure , described in detail e.g. by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.2.4 ) , as the standard test or the standard solution in the following .",
    "a continuous prior can however be utilized in a simpler alternative strategy , in which the evidence against @xmath6 is evaluated indirectly by using inverted credible sets for testing . in this procedure a credible set @xmath7 , such that @xmath8 , is computed and the null hypothesis is rejected if @xmath9 . using credible sets for testing avoids the additional complication of imposing explicit probabilities on the hypotheses , avoids lindley s paradox and allows for the use of non - informative priors .    while it has been argued that tests of point - null hypotheses are unnatural from a bayesian point of view , they are undeniably of considerable practical interest ( berger & delampady , 1987 ; ghosh et al . , 2006 ,",
    "section 2.7.2 ; robert , 2007 , section 5.2.4 ) .",
    "inverting credible sets is arguably the simplest way to test such hypotheses .",
    "for this reason , inverting credible sets as a means to test hypotheses has long been , and continues to be , a part of bayesian statistics .",
    "tests of this type have been studied by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , among many others .",
    "* section 10.2 ) credited this procedure to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.6 ) , who in turn credited it to @xcite .",
    "lindley suggested that it may be useful when the prior information is vague or diffuse , with the caveat that the distribution of @xmath3 must be resonably smooth around @xmath1 for the inversion to be sensible .",
    "* section 3.4 ) motivated this procedure by its resemblance to frequentist methods .",
    "* section 2.7 ) described the inversion of credible sets as `` a very informal way of testing '' .",
    "zellner remarked that `` no decision theoretic justification appears available for this procedure '' .",
    "the purpose of this short note is to discuss such justifications and to put inverted credible sets on a decision - theoretic footing , making them formal bayesian tests .",
    "these justifications shed light on when tests based on credible sets should be used . throughout the text",
    "we assume that the parameter space @xmath10 and that the posterior distribution of @xmath3 is proper and absolutely continuous .",
    "we will study three types of credible sets .",
    "a _ highest posterior density ( hpd ) set _ contains all @xmath3 for which the posterior density is greater than some @xmath11 .",
    "its appeal lies in the fact that among all @xmath12 credible sets , the hpd set has the shortest length .    with @xmath13 denoting the posterior quantile function of @xmath3 , such that @xmath14 , the interval @xmath15 is called a @xmath12 _ central interval _",
    "( also known as an equal - tailed , symmetric or probability centred interval ) .",
    "central intervals are often used due to the fact that they are computationally simpler than hpd sets , especially when the hpd set is not connected .",
    "they are also more in line with frequentist practice .",
    "a credible set is a _ credible bound _ ( or a one - sided credible interval ) if it is of the form @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "such sets are of interest when a lower or upper bound for the unknown parameter @xmath3 is desired .",
    "first , we consider tests of the point - null hypothesis @xmath18 .",
    "we begin by comparing test based on credible sets compared to the standard solution with point - mass priors in section [ criticism ] , arguing that the former have many advantages .",
    "we then review a decision - theoretic justification of inverted hpd sets proposed by @xcite in section [ pereira ] .",
    "this justification involves a loss function that is non - standard in that it depends on the sample @xmath5 . in section [ central ]",
    "we propose a justification of inverted central intervals by recasting the problem of testing @xmath6 in a three - decision setting .",
    "this allows us to use a weighted 01 loss to justify tests based on central intervals , avoiding losses that depend on @xmath5 . in section",
    "[ which ] we argue that test using central intervals are preferable to tests using hpd sets .",
    "we then turn our attention to tests of composite hypotheses in section [ composite ] and show that inverting credible sets lead to standard tests in this setting .",
    "consider tests of the point - null hypothesis @xmath18 against @xmath19 .",
    "we will discuss two problems associated with the standard solution to point - null hypothesis testing ; the use of mixture priors and its poor frequentist properties ; that are overcome by using inverted credible sets instead .",
    "we then discuss the main drawback of tests based on credible sets , namely the lack of direct measures of evidence . in the below",
    ", @xmath20 denotes the prior probability of @xmath6 in the standard solution , with @xmath21 being the prior probability of @xmath22 .    _",
    "1 . the use of mixture priors in the standard test . _ one could argue , as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) , that when using the standard solution it is in general reasonable to have @xmath23 so that @xmath6 is not rejected because of its low prior probability .",
    "this is common in practice .",
    "it is however much more sensible to adjust the loss function if stronger evidence is required before @xmath6 is rejected .",
    "the prior distribution should reflect the prior beliefs ( or lack of them ) and not the severity of rejecting @xmath6 . choosing a large @xmath24 corresponds to using a prior with a sharp spike close to @xmath1 .",
    "such priors are only reasonable if there is a very strong prior belief in the null hypothesis , and can not be used in an analysis where at least some degree of objectivity is desired .",
    "when lacking prior information or striving for complete objectivity , it is common practice to use a prior that in some sense is non - informative or objective .",
    "the point - null hypothesis is often a simplification of the hypothesis that @xmath25 for some small @xmath26 , in which case @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath28 is computed under an objective prior on @xmath3 , @xmath24 will invariably be extremely small .",
    "the `` objective '' prior @xmath29 is in fact heavily biased towards @xmath6 .",
    "* section 2 ) claim that a point - null test only makes sense to a bayesian if the prior actually has a sharp spike near @xmath1 .",
    "but it is perfectly reasonable to formulate a hypothesis before constructing an informative prior or to require that an objective prior is used when no prior information is available .",
    "it is furthermore reasonable to require that the prior distribution can be used for more than one type of statistical decision , e.g. both estimation and hypothesis testing ; the prior should reflect prior beliefs and not the type of decision that one is interested in .",
    "_ 2 . the poor frequentist performance of the standard test .",
    "_ there are many situations in which it is reasonable to require that a statistical procedure works well from both a bayesian and a frequentist perspective , particularly when an objective analysis is desirable .",
    "a well - known complication with the standard solution to testing point - null hypotheses is the asymptotic discrepancy between bayesian and frequentist analysis that is known as lindley s paradox @xcite , in which , for any fixed prior , @xmath30 goes to 1 as the sample size increases for values of a test statistic that correspond to a fixed ( small ) @xmath31-value .",
    "thus a frequentist and a bayesian will reach different conclusions as more and more data is collected .",
    "this is another example of how the standard bayesian test favours the null hypothesis .",
    "there is no such discrepancy for tests based on credible sets . on the contrary , when based on non - informative priors , credible sets tend to have favourable properties when treated as frequentist confidence intervals",
    "; see e.g. @xcite ; and hypothesis testing using a credible set is often a valid frequentist procedure .    _ 3 . measures of evidence . _",
    "the main argument against the use of credible sets for testing is that they do not utilize @xmath30 , and so does not really measure the amount of evidence for and against @xmath6 . alas ,",
    "the first part of this argument seems weak , considering the contradictions and paradoxes that the standard tests utilizing @xmath30 give rise to .",
    "it should also be noted that a test can be fully bayesian without being based on @xmath30 as long at it depends only on the posterior distribution .",
    "tests based on inverted credible sets have this property .    while credible sets do not measure the evidence against @xmath6 directly , there are indirect measures associated with such tests . with @xmath32 being the largest hpd set not containing @xmath1 , @xcite proposed @xmath33 , i.e. the smallest @xmath34 for which @xmath1 is not contained in the @xmath12 hpd set , as a measure of evidence against @xmath6 , with values close to @xmath35 indicating that @xmath6 is false .",
    "similar in spirit to the frequentist @xmath31-value , this is a measure of how far out in the tails of the posterior distribution @xmath1 is . with @xmath36 being the largest central interval not containing @xmath1 , one can similarly use @xmath37 as a measure of evidence .",
    "when @xmath32 and @xmath36 are viewed as frequentist confidence intervals , these measures of evidence coincide with the @xmath31-values of the corresponding two - sided tests .",
    "this stands in sharp contrast to the evidence measure @xmath30 utilized in the standard solution , which is irreconcilable with @xmath31-values @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed , along with the @xmath31-value - like measure of evidence mentioned above , a test of @xmath18 that is equivalent to inverting hpd sets , dubbing it the full bayesian significance test .",
    "see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "none of the aforementioned papers discuss the historical background of this test , briefly outlined in section [ intro ] of the present paper .",
    "let @xmath38 denote the _ a priori _ density function of @xmath3 and define @xmath39 @xmath32 is the most credible hpd set not containing @xmath1 .",
    "the pereira  stern test rejects @xmath6 when @xmath33 is `` small '' ( @xmath40 , say ) . in other words",
    ", @xmath6 is rejected at the @xmath41 level if and only if it is not contained in the @xmath42 hpd set .",
    "madruga , esteves and wechsler ( 2001 ) provided a decision - theoretic justification for the pereira - stern test , that is non - standard in that the loss function depends on @xmath5 .",
    "let the test function @xmath43 be @xmath35 if @xmath6 is accepted and @xmath44 if @xmath6 is rejected .",
    "the madruga - esteves - wechsler loss is : @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "minimization of the expected posterior loss leads to the pereira  stern test , where @xmath6 is rejected if @xmath47 . as an example , the test resulting from the choice @xmath48 and @xmath49 is equivalent to inverting the 95 % hpd set .",
    "the controversial part of this decision - theoretic justification of inverting hpd sets is that the loss function depends on @xmath5 . while such loss functions have appeared in the literature a few times ; @xcite give @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.1.4 ) as examples ; they do not appear to be widely accepted .",
    "indeed , choosing the loss function after @xmath5 has been observed is arguably not entirely in line with classic decision theory .",
    "@xcite argue that an advantage with this type of loss is that it allows the statistician to include his or her embarrassment over accepting @xmath6 when @xmath1 is not in a particular hpd set .",
    "such loss functions seems applicable in highly subjective analyses , but should be avoided when objectivity is desirable .",
    "as we will show next , tests based on central intervals can , in contrast , be justified using a standard loss functions .",
    "when testing @xmath6 , credible ( and confidence ) intervals are in practice often used for directional conclusions . if @xmath1 is above ( or below ) the credible interval , it is common practice to reject @xmath6 and to conclude that @xmath3 is larger ( or smaller ) than @xmath1 .",
    "next , we provide a decision - theoretic justification of the inversion of central intervals that uses a standard loss function not involving @xmath5 , and for which the directional conclusions are fully valid .",
    "a justification for the use of hpd sets is obtained in a special case as a corollary .",
    "we formally reformulate the problem of testing the point - null hypothesis @xmath18 as a three - decision problem with directional conclusions .",
    "@xmath6 is then tested against both @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "such problems have previously been studied by for instance @xcite and @xcite in the frequentist setting and @xcite and @xcite in the bayesian setting .",
    "[ centthm ] let @xmath18 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath43 be a decision function that takes values in @xmath52 , such that we accept @xmath53 if @xmath54 . under an absolutely continuous prior for @xmath3 and the loss function @xmath55 with @xmath56 ,",
    "the bayes test is to reject @xmath6 if @xmath1 is not contained in the central @xmath12 credible set .",
    "the expected posterior loss is @xmath57 since @xmath58 because of the absolute continuity of @xmath3 .",
    "the posterior expected losses are therefore @xmath59 and @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "it follows that the bayes decision rule is to accept @xmath6 if @xmath62 , or , equivalently , if @xmath63 . but @xmath64 if and only if the upper bound @xmath65 , in which case @xmath1 is not contained in the central interval . similarly , @xmath66 if and only if the lower bound @xmath67 . thus @xmath6 is accepted if and only if @xmath3 is contained in the @xmath12 central interval .",
    "it is not uncommon that the posterior density is unimodal and symmetric , typical cases of this being normal and student s @xmath68 posteriors . in this case",
    ", the central interval coincides with the hpd set .",
    "the following corollary is therefore immediate .",
    "if @xmath69 is absolutely continuous , symmetric and unimodal , the bayes test under @xmath70 is to reject @xmath6 if @xmath1 is not contained in the @xmath12 hpd set .",
    "typically @xmath71 in @xmath70 , in which case the evidence for either @xmath72 or @xmath22 has to be quite large before @xmath6 is rejected .",
    "this is a conservative type of analysis , where the statistician is somewhat reluctant to reject @xmath6 .",
    "examples of situations where such a loss is applicable include many investigations of hypotheses in science , circumstances where falsely rejecting @xmath6 leads to considerable economical losses and legal and forensic questions ( this loss is in line with the classic _ in dubio pro reo _ principle ) .",
    "the posterior probability of the null hypothesis is not evaluated in this test ( it is always 0 ) , but the probabilities of the two alternative hypotheses are . by the process of elimination , @xmath6 is accepted if neither @xmath72 nor @xmath22 has a high enough posterior probability .",
    "@xmath6 is rejected if @xmath1 is far out in the tails of the posterior distribution , making these tests quite similar to frequentist hypothesis testing .      for historical reasons , test based on hpd sets",
    "are much more common in the literature than tests using central intervals ; confer the references given in section [ intro ] for examples .",
    "however , from a decision - theoretic perspective , the somewhat tautological use of the hpd set @xmath32 in the loss function @xmath73 seems artifical in comparison to the easy - to - interpret loss function @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath73justification of tests using hpd sets involves a good deal more subjectivity than does the justification of tests using central intervals . in most situations ,",
    "the latter test seems to be preferable when a test with a decision - theoretic justification is desirable .",
    "a further argument for prefering inverted central intervals is given by studying _",
    "how _ the two types of tests rejects the null hypothesis .    , where @xmath74 is the variance of the normal distribution with known mean , based on 95 % credible sets using the jeffreys prior .",
    "]    for @xmath75 , when @xmath18 is rejected , there is always an implicit directional aspect to this decision : the null hypothesis is rejected because it seems more likely that @xmath3 belongs to either @xmath50 or @xmath51 .",
    "when the posterior is skewed , hpd sets are , by construction , biased towards one of these sub - alternatives .",
    "such directional rejection biases can be avoided by using inverted central intervals for testing .",
    "when the frequentist properties of test based on hpd and central intervals are evaluated in some common point - null testing problems for scale or rate parameters , it is seen that this rejection bias causes the hpd set test to have worse power properties than the central interval test . for inference about the scale / rate parameters in the normal , gamma , inverse gamma and weibull distributions using the corresponding jeffreys priors , the two tests have comparable power for @xmath76 , while the test using the central interval has higher power for @xmath77 ; sometimes substantially so .",
    "examples are given in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ; the power functions for the other cases are similar . in general",
    ", the central interval test also seems to come closer to attaining the nominal size in this setting .",
    "a similar issue occurs when the posterior density is monotone , as is for instance the case when using the conjugate pareto prior for @xmath3 in @xmath78 . in this setting the hpd set",
    "is an upper or lower confidence bound , meaning that it only is possible to reject @xmath6 in one direction , so that the resulting test in fact is one - sided .    , where @xmath79 is the rate parameter of the exponential distribution , based on 95 % credible sets using the jeffreys prior . ]",
    "when performing tests of composite hypotheses , there is typically no discrepancy between tests based on credible set and the standard bayesian tests .",
    "this will be illustrated with two examples below . for @xmath6 and @xmath22",
    "being uncountable subsets of @xmath80 , both with positive probabilities under an absolutely continuous prior , we will consider the weighted 01 loss function        [ thm3 ] for the hypotheses @xmath82 and @xmath83 , with @xmath84 , let @xmath43 be a test function , such that @xmath6 is rejected if @xmath85 and accepted if @xmath86 . under an absolutely continuous prior for @xmath3 and the loss function @xmath87 with @xmath88 and @xmath89 , @xmath56",
    ", the bayes test is to reject @xmath6 if and only if @xmath1 is not contained in the lower - bound credible set @xmath17 , or , equivalently , if and only if @xmath90 .",
    "this is a standard one - sided test and the credible set test is thus in agreement with the standard methods .",
    "the corresponding justification for upper - bound credible sets is given by considering testing the hypothesis @xmath91 against @xmath92 instead .",
    "for a general composite hypothesis @xmath93 with the alternative @xmath94 , a correspondence between hypothesis testing and credible test can be established using a loss function where falsely accepting the null hypothesis is considered to be much worse than falsely rejecting it .",
    "such a loss can be of considerable use in situations where false acceptance of the null hypothesis can be costly , for instance when screening for diseases , malicious web pages or signs of terrorist activity .",
    "[ allthm ] for the hypotheses @xmath6 and @xmath95 , with @xmath84 , let @xmath43 be a test function , such that @xmath6 is rejected if @xmath85 and accepted if @xmath86 .",
