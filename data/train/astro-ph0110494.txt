    "the structure of the solar corona and solar wind is governed by the interaction between outward streaming coronal plasma and the existing strong magnetic fields .",
    "it is believed that the fast solar wind is associated with coronal holes within which the magnetic field is unipolar , open and probably has further fine structuring .",
    "the slow wind is believed to originate above and at the boundaries of the coronal streamers where the magnetic fields are bipolar , which forces the plasma to flow around regions where the field strength is sufficient to slow down the flow .",
    "the importance of alfvn waves for the energetics of the corona and solar wind has been realized since their discovery @xcite .",
    "the interest in wave phenomena in the solar wind is especially timely now , in the context of interpretation of the cluster observations .",
    "the ulysses observations already revealed a sharp boundary between fast and slow wind .",
    "besides , there are indications that there is a further fine structuring of plumes in the coronal holes , so called spaghetti",
    ". therefore , it is of prime importance to the study interactions of the alfvn waves with these and possibly other structures .",
    "the weakly non - linear regime , relevant to lower coronal applications , has been studied in great detail in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the relevance of this study is prompted by the observations of large amplitude alfvn waves in the solar wind . in this work",
    "we simulate numerically the interaction of a _ strongly non - linear _ alfvnic pulse with a one - dimensional , perpendicular to the magnetic field , plasma inhomogeneity .",
    "we use the equations of ideal mhd @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the magnetic field , @xmath7 is plasma velocity , @xmath8 is plasma mass density , and @xmath9 is plasma thermal pressure for which the adiabatic variation law is assumed .",
    "we solve equations ( 1)-(4 ) in cartesian coordinates ( @xmath10 ) and for simplicity assume that there is no variation in the @xmath11-direction , i.e. ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the equilibrium state is taken to be an inhomogeneous plasma of density @xmath13 and a uniform magnetic field @xmath14 in the @xmath15-direction .",
    "we consider the physical situation when _ initially _ longitudinal ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) and transverse ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) compressive perturbations are absent and the initial amplitude of the linearly polarized alfvn wave ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) is essentially non - linear ( relative amplitude normalized to the unperturbed value @xmath22 ) . in this case , if the alfvn wave is initially a plane wave , the subsequent evolution of the wave , due to the difference in local alfvn speed across the @xmath23-coordinate , leads to the distortion of the wave front ( phase mixing ) .",
    "hence the appearance of transverse ( with respect to the applied magnetic field ) gradients , which grow in time as a power - law .",
    "this transverse gradient is the only source of the transverse compressive perturbations , while longitudinal compressive perturbations are also generated due to non - linear coupling to the alfvn wave .",
    "as in @xcite , @xcite , we have used the following background density profile @xmath24 here , @xmath25 is a free parameter which controls the steepness of the density profile gradient . in our normalization , which is the same as that of @xcite , @xcite , the local alfvn speed is @xmath26 .     at @xmath27 .",
    "here @xmath22 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 . ]",
    "full numerical calculation of the non - linear set of mhd equations ( 1)-(4 ) , in the above mentioned geometry , has been performed using _",
    "_ lare2d _ is a numerical code which operates by taking a lagrangian predictor - corrector time step and after each lagrangian step all variables are conservatively re - mapped back onto the original eulerian grid using van leer gradient limiters . this code was also used to produce the results in @xcite , @xcite .     at @xmath27 .",
    "here @xmath22 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 . ]",
    "we set up the code in such a way that initially longitudinal and transverse compressive perturbations as well as density perturbation are absent and the initial amplitude of the alfvn pulse is sufficiently non - linear , i.e. a=0.5 . in the numerical simulations the alfvn perturbation is initially a plane ( with respect to @xmath23-coordinate ) pulse , which has a gaussian structure in the @xmath15-coordinate , and is moving at the local alfvn speed @xmath30 : @xmath31 here , @xmath32 is a dimensionless free parameter which controls the width of the initial gaussian alfvn pulse and it was fixed at 0.1 in our numerical runs .",
    "initially , @xmath20 is non - zero too , and in our normalization it is related to @xmath21 as @xmath33 , while all other quantities are set equal to zero .",
    "the simulation box size is set by the limits @xmath34 and @xmath35 and the pulse starts to move from point @xmath36 towards the positive @xmath15 s .",
    "when @xmath25-parameter was fixed at 0.125 we had to increase our simulation box 1.5 times in order to accommodate fully the density inhomogeneity . in this case",
    "we increased the number of grid point by 1.5 in each direction in order to preserve the same simulation resolution .     at @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath22 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 . ]",
    "1 presents a snapshot of @xmath21 at time @xmath37 .",
    "it can be seen from the graph that because of the difference in local alfvn speeds ( note , that for @xmath38 @xmath39 and for @xmath40 @xmath41 ) the initially flat ( with respect to @xmath23-coordinate ) gaussian pulse has been distorted along @xmath42 axis .",
    "this distortion of the pulse front creates a transverse gradient ( @xmath43 ) which is a driving force for the generation of the transverse compressive wave ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "interesting observation is that leftmost ( @xmath44 ) and rightmost ( @xmath45 ) wings of the alfvn pulse decay due to shock formation at different rates .",
    "namely , the rightmost wing where local alfvn velocity is larger dissipates at a larger rate .",
    "this can be roughly explained by the fact that in the scalar cohen - kursrud equation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which describes the evolution of a weakly non - linear alfvn wave until the shock formation , the non - linear term is proportional to @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the speed of sound .     at @xmath48 .",
    "here @xmath22 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 . ]",
    "therefore it is expected that the shock formation would be reached quicker where the local alfvn velocity is greater ( in this case rightmost wing ) .",
    "yet another interesting feature can be seen form this graph which is appearance of a small bump in the solution at @xmath42 ( phase - mixing region ) .",
    "this could be explained by an energy exchange of the alfvn wave with the transverse and longitudinal compressive waves .",
    "the latter is expected to happen exactly along the @xmath42 line where coupling between all three modes is strongest .",
    "we present solution of eqs.(1)-(4 ) with the above described equilibrium and the initial conditions for the case when plasma-@xmath0 is 2 .",
    "the @xmath25-parameter was fixed at 0.3125 which corresponds to the rather smooth maximum in the dependence of @xmath49 versus @xmath25 for this value of @xmath0 ( cf .",
    "fig . 5 and pertaining discussion below ) .     versus @xmath25 for @xmath29 ( solid curve ) and @xmath1 ( dashed curve ) . here , @xmath22 .",
    "]    at time @xmath50 transverse and longitudinal compressive waves as well as density perturbation were absent from the system , while at time @xmath37 as we see from figs . 2 and 3",
    ", these physical quantities grew up to a substantial fraction of the initial alfvn wave amplitude .",
    "the transverse compressive wave , @xmath18 , is generated by the @xmath51 driving term see for details @xcite . in the homogeneous plasma ( @xmath52 ) for a plane wave this term is identically zero , thus , in the numerical runs with @xmath52 we have seen no generation of @xmath18 at all .",
    "this is the plasma inhomogeneity that leads to the generation of the transverse compressive wave in this case .",
    "the situation with the longitudinal compressive wave , @xmath16 , is different : even in the absence of the plasma density inhomogeneity the efficient generation of @xmath16 still occurs due to the @xmath53 term . by looking at fig .",
    "3 we gather that the solution consists of two parts : first , two positive and negative spikes , which dominate the the solution by absolute value , which indeed come from the phase - mixing region , i.e. part of the solution which is caused by density inhomogeneity and the second , relatively plane wave front with a substantial deep in the middle which is caused by the non - linear coupling to the alfvn wave . it can be also gathered that the second part is moving at about twice of the local alfvn speed because @xmath29 .     versus @xmath0 . here , @xmath54 and @xmath22 .",
    "]    the relative density perturbation presented in fig .",
    "4 has similar structure as @xmath16 , but it is enhanced in the region of interaction .",
    "@xmath55 in this case , i.e. 30 % of the amplitude of initial alfvn perturbation .",
    "next , we explore parametric space of the problem . in particular , we investigate how the maximal value of the generated transverse compressive wave depends on the plasma density inhomogeneity parameter , @xmath25 , plasma @xmath0 , and initial amplitude of the alfvn wave , @xmath56 . in fig .",
    "5 we plot dependence of @xmath49 versus @xmath25 for @xmath29 ( solid curve ) and @xmath1 ( dashed curve ) .",
    "there are two noteworthy features in this graph .",
    "first , the maximal value of the generated transverse compressive wave depends on the plasma density inhomogeneity parameter rather weakly , and second , the efficiency of the generation of @xmath18 is somewhat larger in the @xmath1 case than in the case of @xmath29 . in order to explore the latter feature",
    "further , we made 4 runs of _",
    "lare2d _ code for the different values of @xmath0 , while @xmath25 was fixed at 0.5 .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "we gather from the graph that there is a given value of @xmath0 for which a maximal value of @xmath49 is observed .     versus @xmath56 . here , @xmath54 and @xmath57 . ]",
    "yet another valuable insight can be obtained by studying the dependence of the maximal value of generated transverse compressive wave on the initial amplitude of the alfvn wave as our problem is essentially non - linear . in fig .",
    "7 we plot results of 4 numerical runs for different values of @xmath56 , while @xmath25 and @xmath0 where fixed at 0.5 and 1.25 respectively .",
    "we gather from fig .",
    "7 that quite unexpectedly the ratio @xmath58 is rather insensitive to the variation of the initial amplitude of the alfvn wave , and it varies around about 0.27 . in other words ,",
    "irrespective of @xmath56 , the generated transverse compressive wave attains about 27 % of the initial amplitude of the alfvn wave for this value of @xmath0 . answering the question what determines the observed saturation level of maximal value of the generated transverse compressive wave , we conjecture that , based on the fact that the saturation level is rather insensitive to the variation of @xmath25 ( see fig .",
    "5 ) and it somewhat stronger depends of the variation of @xmath0 ( see figs . 5 and 6 ) , it is mostly dictated by the given value of @xmath0 .",
    "based on the information provided by fig .",
    "6 we conclude that _ the most efficient generation of the transverse compressive wave occurs when @xmath1 and , irrespective of @xmath25 and @xmath56 parameters , transverse compressive wave attains about 32 % of the initial amplitude of the alfvn wave_.",
    "our numerical study of the full mhd equations revealed the following : ( a ) plasma density inhomogeneity is a source of non - linear generation of transverse compressive waves by a plane alfvn wave , and it substantially enhances ( by about a factor of 2 ) the generation of the longitudinal compressive waves .",
    "( b ) attained maximal values of the generated transverse compressive waves are insensitive to the strength of the plasma density inhomogeneity and the initial amplitude of the alfvn wave .",
    "( c ) efficiency of the generation depends weakly upon the plasma @xmath0 parameter .",
    "the maximum generated amplitude of transverse compressive wave , up to 32 % of the initial alfvn wave amplitude , is reached for about @xmath1 .",
    "( d ) inhomogeneity of the medium is essential for the generation of weakly compressible mhd turbulence .",
    "the results obtained demonstrate that plasma inhomogeneities enhance the efficiency of the non - linear wave coupling .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that in this work we neglected variation in the @xmath11-direction , i.e. we set @xmath12 .",
    "this , in turn , prevents linear coupling of the alfvn waves to the compressive waves .",
    "however , validity of this assumption can not be tested observationally so far .",
    "yet another interesting possibility of the generation of compressive waves exists even in the homogeneous plasma when either alfvn wave front is not _ initially flat _ with respect to @xmath23-coordinate or initially flat alfvn wave travels over a _ spatially confined _ plasma density inhomogeneity . in both cases we should observe effective generation of the the compressive waves which possibly do not experience suppression caused by the fact that @xmath59 as in the case considered here and in @xcite .",
