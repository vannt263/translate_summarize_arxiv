    "the major theoretical models of atmospheric structure of exoplanets consider the planet only into two conditions :    * either the flux received by the planet coming from the star is averaged over an hemisphere of the planet in a static case ; * or some sort of redistribution day to night of the incoming flux is included .    in none of this cases",
    "the fact that the flux actually varies with time is taken into account . even in the case of the less eccentric planet , wasp-10 b , with a low eccentricity of 0.057 ( (",
    "* christian et al . 2008 ) ) this represents a variation @xmath0  25% in the received flux between periastron and apoastron    we focused our study to two planets : hd  17156b , the most eccentric transiting planet , and even if hd  80606b is not transiting , we choose this planet with the largest eccentricity to show the extreme case .",

    "in order to model the planets atmosphere , we use a line - by - line radiative transfer code which is described in details in @xcite .",
    "the equation we have to solve is : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the temperature , @xmath3 time and we divided the flux @xmath4 into 2 quantities : the thermal flux emitted by the planet ( upward - downward ) @xmath5 and the stellar net flux ( downward - upward)@xmath6 , so that we have @xmath7 .",
    "we take advantage of the fact that the time is explicitly included in the equation by introducing a variation of the insolation at each time step .",
    "this variation can be due to the non - constant planet - to - star distance during the eccentric orbit and/or to the rotation of the atmosphere since the eccentric planets have a remnant spin .",
    "they are indeed supposed to be in pseudo - rotation .",
    "we calculated the rotation period using the prescription of @xcite ( see tab .  1 ) .",
    "here is the scheme of our calculations :      the first thing we do is calculate the thermal structure of a planet with the planet characteristics located at the semi major axis .",
    "we do so iteratively .",
    "that means that    1 .   for an initial thermal profile",
    "we calculate the heating and cooling rates 2",
    ".   then make them converge by modifying the thermal profile according to eq .",

    "if the profile is different by the end of process ( _ b _ ) ; we begin process ( _ a _ ) with the new profile ; if it is the same that means that we have reached the static solution .",
    "we then calculate for each time the actual planet - star distance and take the distance factor into account to correct for the right insolation .",
    "this is a modified version of point ( _ b _ ) from above .",
    "we obtain a thermal profile as well as the spectra for each time step .",
    "the results of this step is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : res1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : res2 ] for the thermal structures and in fig .",
    "[ fig : res3 ] for the fluxes .",
    "eventually we add the rotation of the planet .",
    "these eccentric planets are indeed supposed to not be completely synchronized .",
    "but we choose to implement the rotation along with a multi - latitude / multi - longitude approach ( and a parallelization of the code ) .",
    "this step is still on the way ( see the perspectives section for further details ) .",
    "here is some simplifications that we have done :    * the chemical composition is not changed as the thermal profile does .",
    "the species are calculated at the semi major axis distance . * in the same way , the heating rates and cooling rates are for now only calculated at the semi major axis .",
    "then only the varying * stellar heating * is accounted for .",
    "* we have not included any clouds due to the uncertainties on the formation processes .",
    "[ fig : res3 ] compares the ratio of the planet flux over the star flux as a function of wavelength .",
    "we want to draw your attention on the fact that before comparing directly with _ spitzer _",
    "observations , we have to take into account the phase effects . here",
    ", we have an average over the planet . during secondary",
    "eclipses we observe the illuminated hemisphere , this leads to very different values of the flux  in the next development of the code ( see the perspective section ) , this will be investigated .",
    "* we have benefited the parallelization capabilities of our code to include a different heating pattern depending on the longitude and latitude . by adding also the planet rotation with the samemethod as in @xcite",
    ", we will be able to construct a thermal map of the planet as a function of time . by integrating the view corresponding to the observation",
    ", we will also be able to calculate a full light curve in any wavelength band .",
    "* we then will also include a calculation of the heating rates and cooling rates for each planet point as well as the corresponding thermal profiles and chemical composition .",
    "* finally , we will also calculate the above quantity as a function of time .",
    "this will require a huge increase of the calculation speed .",
    "the use of the correlated k - coefficient method ( opposed to line - by - line ) will probably be necessary .",
    "we presented a still under development time - dependent radiative model for the atmosphere of the transiting planets .",
    "this model takes into account the eccentricity of their orbit and in its next version will be able to completely map the planet , including the rotation effects on the insolation .",
    "the preliminary results shows already that an eccentric planet in under heating conditions is very different that if it were sitting at its semi major axis , even for a low eccentricity even if several steps need to be completed before reaching a fully self - consistent model .",
