    "<S> rev . lett . 89 , 220404 ( 2002 ) ] for detecting the vacuum - induced berry phases with two - mode jaynes - cummings models ( jcms ) , </S>",
    "<S> we show here that , for a parameter - dependent single - mode jcm , certain atom - field states also acquire the photon - number - dependent berry phases after the parameter slowly changed and eventually returned to its initial value . </S>",
    "<S> this geometric effect related to the field quantization still exists , even the filed is kept in its vacuum state . specifically , a feasible ramsey interference experiment with cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) system is designed to detect the vacuum - induced berry phase .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers : 42.50.ct , 03.65.vf    gbksong    in 1984 , berry showed that the state of a quantum system can acquire a purely geometric phase ( called now as berry phase ) , in addition to the usual dynamical phase , after slowly changed and eventually returned to its initial form  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> basically , berry phase does not depend on the dynamical properties of the system , but just depends on the topological feature of the parameter space of the evolved system . </S>",
    "<S> up to now , berry phase has been found in various systems , such as spins , polarized lights , atoms and so on  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , recent studies have shown that the geometric phases can be utilized to implement quantum logic gates for realizing quantum computation  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> quantized optical fields , as well as their interactions with atoms , are the main objects in quantum optics . </S>",
    "<S> originally , the famous jaynes - cummings model ( jcm )  @xcite is introduced to describe the interaction between an undamped two - level atom and a non - decaying single - mode quantized field , under the rotating - wave approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this model has been widely generalized to treat various interactions between atoms and photons . </S>",
    "<S> these include , e.g. , multilevel atoms interact with multimode quantized fields , and various multiphoton processes in quantum optics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the basic phenomena in quantum optics is that , the vacuum of a quantized field can behave as a physical reality with certain observable effects . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in terms of vacuum fluctuations of the quantized electromagnetic field  @xcite certain important quantum effects , such as lamb shifts and spontaneous emissions can be well explained . </S>",
    "<S> recent works  @xcite indicated that , the vacuum of quantized optical field could also induce the observable berry phases . in order to observe these vacuum - induced geometric effects , two filed modes were introduced  @xcite to interact with a two - level atom . as a consequence , the experimental tests are relatively complicated .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we show that only one field mode interacting with a two - level atom could be utilized to detect the vacuum - induced berry phase . beginning with a generic model , i.e. , the @xmath0-quantum jcm </S>",
    "<S> , we show how the desirable berry phase can be acquired by an evolved quantum state in a parameter - dependent single - mode jcm . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we design a ramsey interference device involved with only one filed mode to detect such a geometric effect related to the field quantization .    </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of a @xmath0-quantum jcm  @xcite , i.e. , a two - level system coupled to a quantized mode via a @xmath0-photon process , can be expressed as ( under the rotating - wave approximation ) @xmath1 here , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the creation and annihilation operators of the cavity field with frequency @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the pauli operators of the atom . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 is the transition frequency of the atom between the excited state @xmath9 and ground state @xmath10 , and @xmath11 the coupling coefficient between the atom and cavity mode . under a time - dependent unitary transformation @xmath12 , </S>",
    "<S> the above hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the detuning . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenstates of such a hamiltonian read @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively . above , @xmath17 are the number states the quantized bonsic field , and @xmath18 $ ] .    following fuentes - guridi _ et . </S>",
    "<S> al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we introduce a phase - shift operation @xmath19=\\exp[-i\\phi(t)a^{\\dag}a]$ ] to change the hamiltonian ( 2 ) to the following parameter - dependent form @xmath20 obviously , such a @xmath21-dependent hamiltonian describes a two - level atom interacting ( via a @xmath0-photon process ) with a quantized field mode . here , the phase parameter @xmath22 changes with the time @xmath23 and can be changed slowly from @xmath24 to @xmath25 generating a cyclic path in the parameter space during the evolution . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> if the system begins with one of its eigenstates , @xmath26 or @xmath27 , then it returns to such state but acquires a geometric phase ( besides the dynamical one not shown here ) @xmath28 or @xmath29    it is seen that the geometric phase acquired here depends on the photon number @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> physically , this nontrivial quantum effect can be measured by using an interference procedure between the eigenstate @xmath31 ( or @xmath31 ) and the ground state @xmath32 , for which no geometric phase is acquired . </S>",
    "<S> typically , if the system begins with the state @xmath33 , i.e. , the field is in a vacuum state , the above adiabatic operation performed on the degrees of freedom of the field still yields a berry phase @xmath34    , respectively.,width=453,height=249 ]    with the solid angle @xmath35 $ ] . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows how the above vacuum - induced berry phase varies with the parameter @xmath36 . through adiabatic evolution , </S>",
    "<S> the initial state @xmath37 coupling to vacuum mode in cavity acquires a geometric phase . in this case , the atom - field entanglement in the eigenstates ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) can not be neglected  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the expression ( 8) can not only be interpreted as a geometric phase of the two level system , as the origin of the geometric phase is related to the vacuum fluctuation of the field . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , for a common @xmath38 the more quantum @xmath0 corresponds to the greater vacuum - induced berry phase . basically , the photon - dependent berry phase shown in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 6 - 7 ) is due to the performance of the field quantization . thus , even the photon number of the field is @xmath24 , the geometric phase is still nontrivially induced . </S>",
    "<S> any classical correspondence of such a phenomenon does not exist .    </S>",
    "<S> berry phases related to field quantization could be measured with the usual one - photon jcms , which had been experimentally demonstrated in the well - known cavity qed systems . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , various quantum natures  @xcite of the radiation field interacting with atoms have been successfully demonstrated with these systems . </S>",
    "<S> typically , a cavity qed experiment  @xcite involved with _ two _ quantized bosonic modes was proposed to test the geometric phases generated in a two - mode jcm . </S>",
    "<S> below , we show that a cavity qed system involved only one quantized bosonic mode could also be utilized to test the above vacuum - induced berry phase . </S>",
    "<S> our proposed setup for such a test is shown in fig .  2 , wherein an atom is emitted from the source @xmath39 and then flies sequentially across @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and is finally detected in @xmath43 .    , and flies sequentially across the first ramsey zone @xmath40 , high - q quantized cavity @xmath41 ( wherein the cavity is kept in the vacuum state and the desirable vacuum - induced berry phase is generated by a classical driving from @xmath44 ) , the second ramsey zone @xmath42 , and then is finally detected in @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the information of the vacuum - induced berry phase is extracted by the measured atomic probability.,width=585,height=226 ]    initially , the atom is assumed to be prepared in the upper level @xmath37 in the source @xmath39 and then emitted . </S>",
    "<S> after the first ramsey zone @xmath40 , the state of the atom reads @xmath45 being the time spent by the atom inside the zone @xmath46 .    during the atom flies across the high - q quantized cavity @xmath41 , the parameter - dependent hamiltonian ( 5 ) can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a raman configuration shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 is utilized to achieve the @xmath21-dependent one - photon jcm . here , an auxiliary external classical laser beam @xmath47 is applied to drive the transition @xmath48 with the rabi frequency @xmath49 , while the quantized cavity mode ( @xmath50 ) couples to the transition @xmath51 with the strength @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian describing such a configuration in the interaction picture reads ( @xmath53 ) ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) @xmath54 with @xmath55 being the detuning . </S>",
    "<S> generally , the corresponding time - evolution operator can be formally expressed as @xmath56    under the so - called large - detuning limit , i.e. , @xmath57 , the second - order contribution to @xmath58 is significantly important than the first order one . </S>",
    "<S> this is because that the former involves terms linear in time , whereas the latter involves the terms that are just oscillatory or constant in time . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can only retain the above second - order terms and rewrite the above time - evolution operator ( 14 ) as @xmath59\\right\\}t=1-ih_{\\rm eff}t,\\ ] ] with an effective hamiltonian @xmath60,\\,\\lambda_1=\\frac{\\omega _ { 0}g}{\\delta}.\\ ] ] obviously , this effective hamiltonian is equivalent ( apart from the unimportant stark shifts ) to the above @xmath21-dependent hamiltonian ( 5 ) with @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , after passing the cavity vacuum wherein the driving parameter @xmath21 changes from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , the atom undergoes the following evolution @xmath62 with rabi frequency @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a classical laser field driving the transition @xmath63 ( with rabi frequency @xmath64 ) is applied to produce the desirable @xmath21-dependent single - mode jcm.,width=340,height=249 ]    , the probability of the atom being detected in the state @xmath37 . this probability is a function of the controllable parameter @xmath65 related to the atom interacting with the cavity . here </S>",
    "<S> , the blue curve corresponds to the ramsey interferometry without berry phase , while the red curve shows the situation in which a geometric phase shift ( @xmath66 ) is induced . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the black ( dashed ) curve shows that in the presence of the cavity decay @xmath67 khz , the @xmath68 is little influenced.,width=510,height=325 ]    here , @xmath69 is the vacuum - induced berry phase acquired in the pass of the cavity , and @xmath70 with @xmath71 being the duration of the atom stayed in the cavity .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , after passed the second ramsey zone @xmath42 , the atom evolves to the state @xmath72 with @xmath73 if the two ramsey zones are properly set such that the condition @xmath74 is exactly satisfied , then the probability of detecting the atom in its upper level @xmath37 in @xmath43 is @xmath75 if @xmath76 is set inside the cavity , the above probability can be further simplified to @xmath77 which is directly related to the berry phase acquired by the atom flying across the high - q quantized cavity @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , berry phase generated in the one - photon jcm could be observed by the above ramsey interference method .    experimentally , the above one - photon rabi frequency is set as @xmath78khz  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that , if the solid angle is required as @xmath79 , then the parameter @xmath80 should be set to satisfy the condition @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> since the parameter @xmath80 is determined above by @xmath82 $ ] , with @xmath83 , the rabi frequency of the applied classical driving should be designed as @xmath84 . on the other hands , in order to satisfy the large detuning condition required above , i.e. , @xmath85 , we may typically set @xmath86 yielding @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the atom - field interaction cam perform @xmath88 complete rabi cycle during an effective atom - cavity interaction time of @xmath89 ms  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction time is manifestly shorter than the decaying time ( @xmath90ms ) of the cavity ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss how the dissipation of the cavity influence on the observable effect of the vacuum - induced geometric phase . following the ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the effective hamiltonian of the atom - cavity system becomes : @xmath91 . with the same procedure we can prove that , through a cyclic and adiabatic evolution the acquired geometric phase reads @xmath92 </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath93 should be a perturbation quantity , we can expand the above geometric to the second order in @xmath94 and then obtain @xmath95 consequently , the probability of the atom being detected in the state @xmath37 is changed to be @xmath96/2 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> notice that in the case of low decoherence , the lowest order correction of the expected geometric phase is only quadratic in @xmath93 , suggesting that the field decoherence may not play such an important role in the proposed experiment . </S>",
    "<S> this can be numerically verified from the comparison in the fig .  4 : after considering the presence of a typical cavity dissipation @xmath97  @xcite , the probability of the atom being detected in the state @xmath37 ( the black line ) is almost unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the experimental detection of the vacuum - induced berry phase in jcm with the above ramsey interference is feasible , even in presence of the cavity losses .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have calculated the berry phase of @xmath0-quantum jcm and proposed an experimental setup to observe and measure such a geometric phase induced by the vacuum field in an one - photon single - mode jcm . basically , geometric phases acquired by the atom - field system are dependent of the number of photons in the field . </S>",
    "<S> this is different from those attained in semi - classical counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> our results show also that , for a common @xmath38 , the more quantum @xmath0 corresponds to the larger vacuum - induced berry phase . </S>",
    "<S> a ramsey interference experiment with cavity qed is designed to detect the vacuum - induced berry phase . </S>"
