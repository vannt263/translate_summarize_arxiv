    "stars form from cold gas .",
    "disk galaxies like the milky way or the magellanic clouds have significant quantities of cold gas in their disks , and this gas has sustained star formation through most or all of the galaxies lifetimes .",
    "elliptical galaxies lack cold gas , and for at least several gigayears these systems have not formed significant numbers of stars .",
    "photometry of galaxies observed in the sloan digital sky survey shows that in a colour - magnitude diagram galaxies predominantly lie in either a `` blue cloud '' or a `` red sequence '' , with a smaller number of galaxies in a `` green valley '' between these features @xcite .",
    "blue - cloud galaxies are forming stars , while red - sequence galaxies are not .",
    "both populations extend to faint magnitudes , but the red sequence extends to significantly brighter magnitudes than the blue cloud .    within the luminous elliptical galaxies of the red sequence two sub - populations can be distinguished . at very bright magnitudes",
    "there are objects with slightly boxy isophotes and luminosity profiles that become shallow at small radii , while at fainter magnitudes the galaxies mostly have disky isophotes and power - law inner surface - brightness profiles @xcite .",
    "in this paper we argue that all these phenomena are reflections of the way gas at a galaxy s virial temperature interacts with the cold gas required for star formation .    during an episode of star formation , only a part of the gas reservoir that drives the episode is converted into stars ; some of the residual gas is heated by supernovae to a temperature @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "dark halos with masses @xmath2 have potential wells that are too shallow to contain supernova - heated gas , so it flows out into intergalactic space .",
    "more massive halos do confine the hot gas gravitationally , with the result that once the halo s mass exceeds @xmath3 , the density of hot gas in a halo builds up . as the density rises , the central cooling time of the gas shortens , and the rate at which gas accretes onto the central black hole ( bh ) increases .",
    "studies of cooling flows suggest that the temperature sensitivity of the accretion rate onto the bh leads to an unsteady equilibrium , in which jets powered by accretion onto the bh replenish energy radiated by the gas @xcite .",
    "hence halos with @xmath4 are filled with gas at the virial temperature , and the density of this gas steadily increases .",
    "we argue that such trapped hot gas eliminates cold gas by a combination thermal conduction and ablation . in the more massive galaxies of the red sequence",
    ", cold gas is eliminated within a dynamical time , with the result that when an object that contains cold gas falls into such a galaxy , the infalling gas has negligible chance of reaching the galaxy s core before being heated to near the virial temperature .",
    "hence , once a core develops in the luminosity profile of a massive galaxy of the red sequence , it can not be be filled in by a central burst of star formation .",
    "a corollary is that these systems do not contain embedded disks , so their isophotes are more likely to be boxy than disky .    in less luminous galaxies of the red sequence ,",
    "the time required for cold gas to be heated is likely to be longer than a dynamical time , so when one of these galaxies encounters a gas - rich system , there is a central burst of star formation that fills in the core in the luminosity profile that is produced by dissipationless dynamics .",
    "moreover such central starbursts naturally account for the fact that elliptical galaxies with power - law inner luminosity profiles have younger central stellar populations ( see section  [ secobs ] ) .",
    "the galaxies of the blue cloud are expected to contain hot gas  in the case of the milky way , @xcite already made this inference  but such gas is typically not detected in x - ray observations , suggesting that its density is lower than in red - sequence galaxies of similar mass .",
    "thus , evaporation of cold gas is not a significant process in blue - cloud galaxies .",
    "however , in the last decade it has become clear that star - forming disk galaxies cycle their interstellar media through their halos several times over the hubble time ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "consequently , once a potential well becomes so deep that it confines supernova - heated gas , and gas accumulates at the virial temperature , the cycling of the interstellar gas through the halo makes the interstellar gas vulnerable to evaporation .",
    "star formation ceases and the galaxy quickly moves from the blue cloud to the red sequence .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ seceva ] defines the relevant parameters and presents formulae from which they can be calculated .",
    "numerical values for representative galaxy models are presented in section  [ secmod ] .",
    "when considering accretion events one has to add the effects of encounters with systems that vary widely in mass ; section  [ secspec ] provides a treatment of this problem .",
    "sections  [ secegal ] and [ secblue ] discuss the implications for elliptical galaxies and galaxies of the blue cloud , respectively .",
    "our conclusions are in section  [ seccon ] .",
    "we want to determine the fate of a cloud of cool ( @xmath5 ) gas that falls through gas at the virial temperature @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , we ask whether a spheroidal cloud with semi - major axis length @xmath7 that is on a sufficiently low angular - momentum orbit can reach the galaxy centre and form stars there .",
    "the motion of a cold cloud through a hot plasma is a complex dynamical process , involving heat conduction , radiative cooling , ram - pressure drag and ablation through the kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "we crudely simplify the treatment of this process by assuming that the cloud experiences only two opposed physical mechanisms : evaporation by thermal conduction from the hot interstellar medium ( ism ) and condensation by radiative cooling .",
    "the rate at which hot gas will ablate a cold cloud must depend on the speed of the cloud s motion through the ambient gas , and will be slowest for a stationary cloud ; in this case a sheath of warm gas builds up around the cloud , partially insulating it from the hot ambient medium . in this paper",
    "we evaluate this minimum rate of ablation .",
    "we neglect the cloud s self - gravity , thus limiting ourselves to the case of clouds much smaller than the host galaxy .    depending on the physical properties of the ism and on the size ( and geometry ) of the cloud , the heat flux from the ism to the cloud",
    "is either classical @xcite or saturated @xcite .",
    "for given temperature and density of the ism , we define the ` saturation size ' @xmath8 such that the heat flux saturates for @xmath9 , and a ` critical size ' @xmath10 at which radiative cooling balances heat conduction : clouds bigger than @xmath10 condense the ambient medium , while smaller clouds evaporate ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . for clouds of size",
    "@xmath11 we have to compare the evaporation time @xmath12 with the dynamical time @xmath13",

    "we checked these results by evaluating the parameters of the gas rich galaxies ngc  4472 and ngc  4649 @xcite , and the gas - poor galaxies ngc  3377 and ngc  3245 @xcite , finding results similar to those of the models lm and hm , respectively .",
    "[ figrm ] and [ figepsm ] yield the following conclusions :",
    "figures  [ figepsm ] and [ figmacc ] show that in an x - ray luminous galaxy a cold cloud has to be @xmath79 times more massive to reach the centre than in an elliptical with weak x - ray emission , and aggregate gas in infall available for central star formation is more important in the latter than in the former .",
    "thus we expect cold gas and its associated star formation to have a much bigger impact on the centres of x - ray weak ellipticals than on the centres of their x - ray luminous brethren . in this section",
    "we discuss the nature of this impact and relate it to a dichotomy in the observed properties of elliptical galaxies .      on the basis of their central surface brightness ( sb ) profiles ,",
    "luminous elliptical galaxies fall into two distinct classes : power - law ( or sersic ) galaxies ( plgs ) , with sb profiles well represented by the @xcite law down to the centre , and core ( or core - sersic ) galaxies ( cgs ) , with sb profiles deviating from the sersic law in the central regions because of the presence of a flat core @xcite .",
    "quantitatively , the corresponding intrinsic stellar density profiles have inner logarithmic slope @xmath80 in plgs , and @xmath81 in cgs , with few `` intermediate '' galaxies , having @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "it is useful to summarise the main observed properties of plgs and cgs .    1 .   _",
    "global galaxy properties : _ 1 .",
    "cgs are typically more luminous than plgs , with a dividing luminosity @xmath83 .",
    "in particular , all galaxies brighter than @xmath84 are cgs , while all galaxies fainter than @xmath85 are plgs . at intermediate luminosities",
    "both types coexist @xcite .",
    "cgs have boxy isophotes and rotate slowly , plgs have disky isophotes and rotate rapidly @xcite .",
    "3 .   almost all the brightest cluster galaxies are cgs @xcite .",
    "4 .   all galaxies with high x - ray emission from hot gas ( high @xmath86 ) are cgs , while ellipticals with lower @xmath86 include both cgs and plgs @xcite .",
    "properties of the central regions : _ 1 .",
    "all ellipticals have central colour gradients , becoming redder towards the centre .",
    "cgs have weaker central colour gradients than do plgs , though the difference is small and there is large scatter @xcite .",
    "cgs are rounder than plgs at small radii .",
    "plgs typically have central stellar disks , while cgs do not @xcite .",
    "3 .   nuclei ( typically bluer than the surrounding galaxy ) are more frequent in plgs than in cgs @xcite . in the virgo cluster",
    "no galaxies brighter than @xmath87 have nuclei @xcite .",
    "lower - velocity dispersion ellipticals have significantly younger central stellar populations than higher - velocity dispersion ellipticals ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this should imply a correlation between the stellar age of the inner regions of ellipticals and the central slope @xmath88 of the sb profile . combining information on the central age from @xcite and on @xmath88 from @xcite",
    ", we considered a sample of 20 elliptical and lenticular galaxies , which turn out to be nicely segregated in a diagram plotting central age versus @xmath88 ( fig .",
    "[ figage ] ) , with cgs and plgs having median central ages @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively ) with an estimated central age @xmath91 .",
    "we note that ngc  4382 has relatively low @xmath86 @xcite and is characterised by atypical central sb profile and inner colour gradient @xcite . ] .",
    "activity of the central black hole : _ 1 .",
    "the mean ratio @xmath92 of the optical nuclear emission and the eddington luminosity of the central bh is higher by two orders of magnitude in plgs than in cgs @xcite .",
    "2 .   if @xmath93 is the global power of both core and extended emission at @xmath94ghz cgs cover the full range ( @xmath95 ) , while plgs show no significant radio activity @xcite .",
    "3 .   with @xmath96",
    "the ratio of the radio to b - band luminosities of the nucleus and @xmath97 the ratio of radio and @xmath98kev x - ray luminosities , cgs are radio - loud ( @xmath99 ; @xmath100 ) , while plgs are radio - quiet ( @xmath101 ; @xmath102 ) @xcite .      during hierarchical galaxy formation luminous galaxies arise from mergers of lower - luminosity systems .",
    "lower - luminosity galaxies tend to be plgs , so the natural starting point for discussing the origin of the cg / plg dichotomy is the morphology of plgs .",
    "that is , we assume that at early enough times any elliptical galaxy is a plg , and our task is to explain why some systems became cgs . in this spirit one",
    "associates with each cg a mass deficit @xmath103 equal to the mass that would have to be added to the core to make the sb profile that of a plg : typically @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the central bh mass @xcite .",
    "this observation suggests the following popular `` core - scouring '' scenario , which has been validated by n - body simulations @xcite : during dissipationless merging , the orbiting bhs reduce the central star density by scattering stars out of the most tightly bound orbits @xcite .",
    "thus in the core - scouring scenario the central slope @xmath88 is determined by the merging history of the galaxy , and the mass deficit @xmath103 is naturally of the order of the masses of the participating bhs .",
    "the core - scouring scenario is successful in reproducing some of the observations , but it can not be a complete explanation because no purely stellar - dynamical mechanism can introduce a characteristic mass scale and thus explain why plgs are never luminous , while cgs often are .",
    "moreover , core scouring alone does not explain the origin of the correlation between the presence of cores and strong diffuse x - ray emission @xcite , nor does it explain why flat cores have not formed in plgs , given that low - luminosity ellipticals such as m32 also harbour bhs @xcite .",
    "the discussion above suggests that a plausible working hypothesis is that all ellipticals at some stage in their evolution have central cores .",
    "the results of sections  [ secmod ] and [ secspec ] and the relative youth of the central regions of plgs ( fig .",
    "[ figage ] ) suggest that in plgs the core created by dissipationless dynamics has been filled in by star formation from cold gas that fell in during or after a merger .",
    "the aggregate mass of new stars formed will be proportional to the quantity @xmath106 introduced in section  [ secspec ] .",
    "the proposal requires that @xmath107 in plgs and @xmath108 in cgs .",
    "we know that @xmath104 , and @xmath105 is proportional to the total stellar mass of the galaxy @xcite , so it is reasonable to assume @xmath109 .",
    "so @xmath110 , and our finding that @xmath74 is higher in hot - gas poor than in hot - gas rich ellipticals ( fig .  [ figmacc ] ) implies that the former are more likely to fill any central core .",
    "quantitatively , this result will depend on the properties of the cloud mass spectrum . in section  [ secspec ]",
    "we concluded that when the power - law slope @xmath66 of the mass function of clouds is similar to the faint - end slope of the galaxy luminosity function , the mass of gas that can reach the centre , normalised to the galaxy mass @xmath47 is at least a factor of 3 higher in lower - mass ellipticals than in higher - mass ellipticals .",
    "this difference rises to at least a factor of 15 if @xmath111 , as it would be if the cloud mass spectrum were the same as that of cdm halos .",
    "for very massive galaxies for which @xmath31 could be almost as high as @xmath112 very little cold gas can reach the galaxy centre ( see section  [ secspec ] ) .",
    "so , we expect fainter galaxies to accumulate cold gas that supports central star formation , while the more massive galaxies can at most partially fill in the core created by dissipationless dynamics .",
    "the hypothesis that since its last major merger or accretion event every plg has experienced an episode of central star formation from cold , rapidly rotating gas naturally explains all the observations listed in section [ secobs ] under the headings ( i ) and ( ii ) :    * it is possible for a faint , gas - poor elliptical to be a cg galaxy simply because it has not encountered a source of cold gas since its last major merger .",
    "the brightest ellipticals have dense virial - temperature atmospheres , so no luminous galaxy should be a plg . * the boxiness and slow rotation of cgs follows from the dominant role played by dissipationless dynamics in their formation . * if a prerequisite for being a cg is the ability to confine hot gas , these galaxies will be , or have been , the central galaxies of groups and clusters .",
    "when two groups merge , their central galaxies will merge , thus ensuring that the central galaxy of the new group is also a cg .",
    "* we have seen that all x - ray luminous galaxies should be the central galaxies of groups or clusters .",
    "such a galaxy can be a plg only if its dense atmosphere built up _",
    "after _ its last major merger .",
    "this is in principle possible but unlikely .",
    "when a small group falls into a rich cluster , it is possible that the central galaxy will be stripped of its dark halo before it is eaten by the central galaxy of the cluster . in this case we will observe a cg that is not x - ray luminous .",
    "there should be plgs in all environments . *",
    "the late burst of star formation that filled in the post - merger core of a plg can be expected to be metal - rich and enhance the galaxy s metallicity gradient . *",
    "the dynamical importance of rotation will increase as cold gas streams in , facilitating the formation of a central disk and/or a rapidly rotating kinematically decoupled core . *",
    "if infall continues long after the merger @xcite and cold gas can reach the centre , a blue nuclear cluster can form .",
    "* if stars can not now form at the centres of cgs , the relative youth of the central stellar populations of plgs is explained .",
    "we now show that our picture also explains the connections between galaxy morphology and active galactic nucleus ( agn ) listed in section [ secobs ] under the heading ( iii ) .",
    "there are two very different modes of bh accretion and feedback , usually referred to as `` cold mode '' ( or qso mode ) and `` hot mode '' ( or radio - mode ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in short , these are the main properties of the two modes :    1 .",
    "_ cold mode _ : the bh feeds from cold gas with @xmath113 , with most of the energy released going into photons ( optical , uv , x - ray ) .",
    "the bh grows significantly in mass , and there is important attendant star formation .",
    "this mode is dominant at high redshift and leads to the correlation between bh and spheroid mass .",
    "the most extreme manifestations of cold mode accretion are luminous qsos .",
    "hot mode _ : the bh feeds from hot gas at @xmath114 , and most of the energy released is mechanical , being associated with bipolar flows , which generate significant radio emission .",
    "the bh mass does not increase significantly , and star formation is inhibited .",
    "the classic hot - mode accretor is @xmath115 @xcite , but fri radio sources probably all belong to this class .",
    "cold - mode accretors can be either radio - loud or radio - quiet , while hot - mode accretors are invariably radio - loud .",
    "in our picture all cgs must be hot - mode accretors , while plgs can be either hot- or cold - mode accretors , depending on whether they happen to have encountered some cold gas recently .",
    "items ( iiia ) , ( iiib ) and ( iiic ) of section [ secobs ] are consistent with this expectation , and taken together suggest that most plgs are in fact accreting cold gas .",
    "a possible explanation of the radio - loudness of cgs is the suggestion of @xcite that a galaxy s merging history determines both the presence of the core and the spin of the bh , and that the latter controls radio - loudness ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . if bh spin were the only factor determining radio - loudness , the radio - loudness of a bh could only change slowly with time .",
    "observations of micro - quasars show that a single source regardless of whether it is powered by a bh or by a neutron star often alternates short bursts of radio - loudness with longer periods of radio quiescence @xcite .",
    "in addition , the long - term time variability of central radio sources in galaxy clusters ( once properly scaled for the bh mass ) is consistent with that of microquasars @xcite .",
    "these two pieces of evidence suggest that radio - loudness is more likely to be controlled by the accretion mode than by bh spin .",
    "the results of the present paper show that the observed radio properties of plgs and cgs fit consistently in this scenario .",
    "thus a considerable body of observational evidence points to a scenario in which the ability of cold gas to survive evaporation from the hot ism is responsible for determining both the inner stellar profiles of elliptical galaxies and the radio emission from their central supermassive bhs .",
    "as outlined in the introduction , a robust bimodality is observed in the properties of galaxies , which in colour - magnitude diagrams are nicely segregated into a red sequence ( extending to the brightest magnitudes ) and a blue cloud ( truncated at @xmath116 ) .",
    "these features , together with the shape of bright - end of the galaxy luminosity function , are hard to reproduce in standard galaxy formation models based on the proposal by @xcite and @xcite that galaxies form by cooling virial - temperature gas .    until recently it has been widely assumed that during virialization of a dark - matter halo gas is heated to the virial temperature and that galaxies form through the cooling of this hot gas . however , both analytic and numerical results suggest that during virialization only a fraction of the gas is heated to the virial temperature , and that this fraction is negligible in halos less massive than a critical mass @xmath117 @xcite . moreover , as @xcite first pointed out , observations of cooling flows suggest that heating by agn - powered jets ensures that gas trapped at the virial temperature never cools .",
    "hence this gas is not available for star formation , and galaxies can only go on forming stars and remain in the blue cloud to the extent that they can acquire cool gas . hence the process studied above , of thermal evaporation of cold gas by hot , bears on the origin of the entire hubble sequence as well as the morphological dichotomy of elliptical galaxies .    while there is now a wide measure of agreement",
    "that in very massive galaxies star formation is `` quenched '' through lack of cold gas , the mechanism responsible for cutting off the supply of cold gas is controversial .",
    "@xcite argue that gravitational heating alone suffices ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "while the efficiency of gravitational heating undoubtedly rises with the clustering mass scale , several observations indicate that non - gravitational heating is important .",
    "indeed studies of the temperature - luminosity correlation of diffuse x - ray sources has long provided strong evidence for powerful non - gravitational heating @xcite .",
    "other indications are the small fraction of baryons contained in galaxies , both in groups like the mw and in rich clusters , the significant fraction of the products of nucleosynthesis that are in intracluster media @xcite , and the direct observation of massive outflows from star - forming galaxies at both small and high redshift @xcite .",
    "the availability of non - gravitational heating is crucial because gravity alone will never drive gas _ out _ of dark matter halos , and the fact that at faint magnitudes the galaxy luminosity function falls further and further below the mass function of dark halos has long been attributed to the ability of non - gravitational heating to drive gas out of low - mass halos @xcite .",
    "so it seems clear that energy released during star ( and possibly black - hole ) formation prevents virial temperature gas accumulating in low - mass halos .",
    "when cool gas falls into these systems it is not heated to the virial temperature , so star formation can continue in them .",
    "it has been suggested that quasars are responsible for terminating star formation in their hosts @xcite .",
    "we feel this proposal is implausible for two reasons : ( i ) the abundant evidence for ( a ) an association between the masses of black holes and their host bulges , ( b ) the coincidence between the peaks in the cosmic star - formation rate and the quasar luminosity density , and ( c ) the rapidity of bulge formation , indicates that quasars are associated with rapid star formation , rather than quenching of star formation .",
    "( ii ) observations of disk galaxies imply that cold infall is a sustained process , while quasars flare up and then die .",
    "so while a quasar may clear its host of cold gas , it can not be responsible for keeping the host clean after its death  which is the great majority of the host s life .",
    "in our view black holes have a vital role to play in quenching star formation , but their role is an indirect one : acting as thermostats for virial - temperature gas , which bears direct responsibility for quenching star formation . the connections between quasars and bulges arise because when cold gas is available on non - circular orbits ( for example during a merger ) , bulge stars form rapidly on non - circular orbits and black holes accrete rapidly in an environment that causes energy released by accretion to be rapidly degraded into low - energy photons that produce only weak feedback on the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "when a halo reaches the critical mass @xmath3 two things happen almost simultaneously : ( i ) the fraction of infalling gas that stays below the virial temperature starts to dwindle , and ( ii ) the virial temperature rises above the temperature to which star and black - hole formation heat gas , so a hot atmosphere begins to accumulate  the temperature of this atmosphere is subsequently adjusted to the virial temperature by hot - mode accretion onto the black hole .",
    "we do not yet know how precise is the coincidence of the mass scales associated with the apparently independent processes ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "however , it is does seem likely that this mass scale accounts for the upper limit to the luminosities of objects in the blue cloud , and that thermal evaporation plays a significant role in setting this limit .",
    "semi - analytic models show that several features of the distribution of galaxies in colour , magnitude and redshift can be accounted for if there is a critical halo mass above which star - formation is quenched ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    a key object , that seems to be on the cusp of the transition across @xmath3 is the edge - on spiral galaxy ngc 5746 .",
    "observation shows that this galaxy is enveloped by a nearly spherical halo of x - ray emitting gas @xcite .",
    "the authors suggest that star formation in the disk is sustained by cooling of this halo in the manner envisaged by @xcite , but it is hard to understand why cooling and star formation is not concentrated at the centre of the bulge , where the halo is densest and the cooling time shortest , rather than further out in the disk , nor how such a nearly spherical cloud could give rise to a disk in circular motion .",
    "it seems much more likely that in ngc 5746 we see the first stages in the growth of the body of trapped virial - temperature gas that will shortly quench star formation , causing the galaxy to move onto the red sequence .",
    "the red sequence extends to faint magnitudes because galaxies hosted by halos that are much less massive than @xmath3 fall into halos of mass @xmath118 and then quickly become red because ( i ) their own cold gas is stripped out of them by a combination of ablation , thermal conduction and supernova - driven flows , and ( ii ) their prospects of accreting fresh cold gas are small given that they are now orbiting inside a halo of mass @xmath118 and moving too fast to merge with other galaxies , which anyway have little cold gas to offer .",
    "@xcite showed that the density - morphology relation is driven by the growth with density in the number of s0 galaxies at the expense of spirals , and @xcite and @xcite have recently proven beyond reasonable doubt that spiral galaxies passively fade into s0 galaxies , presumably as a result of gas - starvation .",
    "another indication that many red - sequence galaxies orbit in more massive halos is the fact that they are preferentially found in dense environments , while blue - cloud galaxies typically reside in lower - density environments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in summary",
    ", a galaxy will move from the blue cloud to the red sequence _ either _ because it sits in a primary halo and the mass of this has just surpassed @xmath3 , _ or _ because it starts to orbit sufficiently deeply in the potential of a primary halo with mass @xmath119 . from this hypothesis",
    "it should be possible to predict the luminosity functions of the blue cloud and the red sequence as functions of redshift , and the clustering properties of red - sequence galaxies . however , to make these predictions one needs both a detailed picture of the clustering of dark halos and the distribution of virial - temperature gas .",
    "the former could be taken from the halo model @xcite , but there is currently no obvious source , either theoretical or observational , from which to draw the latter : determining the distribution of hot gas observationally is hard because extended , low - density virial - temperature gas is a weak x - ray emitter and current x - ray detectors do not have useful velocity resolution . building a model of the hot gas from cosmological simulations that include baryons",
    "is problematic because of the importance for gas of feedback from stars and agn .",
    "cool gas is a fundamental ingredient for galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "naturally , the study of cool gas in galaxies has been mainly focused on late - type galaxies , in which cool gas is most abundant .",
    "early - type galaxies are rather poor in cool gas , but thanks to recent surveys , in co @xcite , hi @xcite and optical lines @xcite , we now have a detailed picture of the properties of the cool gas also in these systems . in elliptical galaxies such cool gas",
    "is immersed in a sea of plasma at the galaxy s virial temperature , and a long - standing question is how these two phases coexist and interact . in previous works evaporation of cool gas by thermal conduction from gas in the hot phase",
    "has been invoked in order to explain the shutdown of star formation in massive galaxies @xcite and the observed ionised - gas kinematics relative to that of the stars in early - type galaxies @xcite , but quantitative estimates of the importance of this process were lacking .",
    "this paper gives a quantitative study of the evaporation of cold gas clouds by thermal conduction from the hot ism .",
    "we focused on two classes of luminous elliptical galaxies , the low - mass ( lm ) and high - mass ( hm ) systems , both of which probably have potential wells deep enough to trap gas heated by star formation , but which differ in the densities of their virial - temperature atmospheres .",
    "we have shown that in the lm systems accreted cold gas is much more likely to feed central star formation than in the hm systems .",
    "this fact naturally explains the observed dichotomy between plgs and cgs in central surface brightness profiles , x - ray luminosity , and activity of the central supermassive bh .",
    "our exploration is based on a rather simplified analytical model of the interaction between cold and hot gas , in which we account in detail only for thermal conduction and radiative cooling because we expect these to be the dominant physical processes .",
    "ideally , the next step would be to explore the problem of cold - gas accretion and evaporation by the hot ism using self - consistent three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "however , due to resolution limits , it appears difficult to describe numerically such a multi - phase gas , even with state - of - the - art hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "another useful step would be to add the results obtained here to semi - analytic models of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "of course , a semi - analytic model is only as good as its input physics and such models are no substitute for ab - initio modelling from elementary physical principles .    stripping and ablation of cold gas from galaxies that are orbiting in the potential well of a system that has",
    "abundant virial - temperature gas undoubtedly plays a large role in determining the morphology of galaxies and the extension of the red sequence to faint magnitudes .",
    "this process is closely related to the one quantified in this paper .",
    "it now seems very likely that the central factor in dividing galaxies into the red sequence and the blue cloud is the existence of a critical halo mass above which gas accumulates at the virial temperature .",
    "what is still unclear is whether the supply of cold gas cuts off in galaxies associated with massive halos because infalling gas is then shock heated to the virial temperature @xcite , or because cold gas is evaporated and ablated by the hot gas @xcite .",
    "this paper shows that thermal evaporation is certainly a non - negligible process .",
