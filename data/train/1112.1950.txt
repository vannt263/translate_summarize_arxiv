    "a majorana fermion is a hypothetical particle which is its own antiparticle .",
    "the search for majorana fermions goes back to the early days of relativistic quantum mechanics .",

    "the positive - energy solutions describe electrons , and the negative - energy solutions correspond to particles with the same mass and spin but opposite charge .",
    "the electron and its antiparticle , the positron , are related by a symmetry operation which takes the complex conjugate of the wave function .",
    "particle and antiparticle can annihilate , producing a pair of photons .",
    "while the photon ( described by a real bosonic field ) is its own antiparticle , dirac fermions are described by complex fields with distinct particle and antiparticle .    in a paper published in 1937 , shortly before his disappearance ,",
    "ettore majorana questioned the need to introduce a distinct antiparticle for each particle @xcite .",
    "the complex dirac equation can be separated into a pair of real wave equations , each of which describes a real fermionic field @xcite .",
    "majorana suggested that neutral particles might be represented by a single real field , and concluded that `` there is now no need to assume the existence of antineutrons or antineutrinos '' .",
    "we since know that the neutron and antineutron are distinct particles , but the neutrino and antineutrino could well be the same particle observed in different states of motion @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen whether or not the majorana fermion will go the way of the magnetic monopole , as a mathematical possibility that is not realized by nature in an elementary particle .",
    "in condensed matter we can build on what nature offers , by constructing quasiparticle excitations with exotic properties out of simpler building blocks .",
    "this happened for magnetic monopoles and it may happen for majorana fermions . the strategy to use midgap excitations of a chiral _ p_-wave superconductor goes back two decades @xcite ( with even earlier traces in the particle physics literature @xcite ) .",

    "that the midgap excitations of a superconductor are majorana fermions follows from electron - hole symmetry : the creation and annihilation operators @xmath5 , @xmath6 for an excitation at energy @xmath1 are related by @xmath7 at the fermi level @xmath8 , so particle and antiparticle coincide .",

    "two interchanges return the majoranas to their starting position , but the final state @xmath44 is in general not equivalent to the initial state @xmath39 .",
    "an operation of the form is called _ topological _ , because it is fully determined by the topology of the braiding ; in particular , the coefficient in the exponent is precisely @xmath45",
    ". this could be useful for a quantum computer , even though not all unitary operations can be performed by the braiding of majoranas @xcite .    before closing this section , we emphasise that the object exhibiting non - abelian statistics is not the majorana fermion by itself , but the majorana fermion bound to a topological defect ( a vortex in fig .  [ fig_vortices ] , the si interface in fig .  [ fig_qshedge ] , or an @xmath46 quasiparticle in the fractional quantum hall effect ) .",
    "the combined object is referred to as an ising anyon in the literature on topological quantum computation @xcite . a free majorana fermion ( such as",
