    "undergraduate texts on quantum mechanics generally emphasize analytical solutions to the schrdinger equation .",
    "but they almost always include a section on hilbert space , and basis states , and the formal solution of a problem through matrix mechanics . in a number of recent papers ,",
    "@xcite we have illustrated , with familiar examples ( harmonic oscillator , coulomb , etc . ) , the determination of bound state energies and eigenfunctions through a matrix formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "all of these examples have used the familiar basis states which are the eigenstates for the infinite square well . in all the cases considered ,",
    "we have truncated the hilbert space to a manageable size , so that the low - lying eigenvalues and their accompanying eigenfunctions are determined to high accuracy .    at the same time , while not really emphasized in textbooks , students are generally made aware that a proper hilbert space needs to complete , to be useful as a basis set .",
    "this message was driven home recently in a study of the helium electronic ground state , utilizing a basis set consisting of two - electron product states of hydrogenic bound state eigenfunctions .",
    "@xcite while this is the natural basis set to use to understand helium ( and , indeed , any multi - electron atom of the periodic table ) , hutchinson et al .",
    "@xcite emphasized that these product states constitute an incomplete basis set , and an accurate description requires the continuum states as well .",
    "quantum chemists learned this lesson long ago,@xcite and therefore never use such a ( technically ) poor basis set .",
    "as argued in ref . - ",
    "@xcite , however , for state - of - the - art research problems on correlated electron systems , sometimes one does not have a choice .",
    "the case of the helium electronic ground state is sufficiently complicated that the lesson in ref . -  @xcite may be beyond the reach of undergraduates .",
    "our purpose is to present a much simpler case , that of the one electron hydrogen - like atom with central charge @xmath1 , which we call ` @xmath2 ' .",
    "here of course the energies and states are a trivial extension to hydrogen itself , where the bohr radius @xmath3 is simply changed to @xmath4 .",
    "we start first by supposing that we do not know this answer , but instead decided to formulate the problem as a matrix problem , using as a basis the familiar bound states of the hydrogen atom .",
    "there are an infinite number of these bound states , so we must necessarily truncate .",
    "as shown in the next section the result converges very rapidly , and no more than ten or so hydrogen bound states are required to attain a converged result , but it is the wrong result ! the reason is explained , also in physical terms , and in the ensuing section we make use of the known exact ground state for this problem to project out the contributions from each hydrogenic state , including the continuum ones .",
    "these coefficients now sum to unity , as should be the case , for a proper description of @xmath2 .",
    "we also illustrate how the continuum wave functions with increasing momentum contribute to the final ( correct ) wave function .",
    "we are interested in the ground state solution for the problem of a single electron interacting with a fixed nucleus of charge @xmath1 .",
    "this has a hamiltonian given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is planck s constant , @xmath8 is the mass of the electron , @xmath9 is the charge of the electron , @xmath10 is the charge of the nucleus , @xmath11 is the permittivity of free space , and @xmath12 is the radial coordinate .",
    "the exact eigensolutions to this problem acquire the usual three quantum numbers , @xmath13 , and as for the case of hydrogen , the ground state has @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and has energy @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the bohr radius .",
    "we have assumed the nucleus to be infinitely heavy so the same mass appears in eq .",
    "( [ z0_ham ] ) as appears in the definition of the bohr radius .",
    "the exact ground state is given by@xcite @xmath19 where the @xmath20 is the contribution from the angular part of the wave function for all @xmath21-states .",
    "now if we proceed as described in the introduction , pretending not to have knowledge of this result , we would first expand the ( unknown ) ground state wave function in terms of a ` handy ' set of basis states , which we denote as @xmath22 , with the index in principle representing multiple quantum numbers . since we are using a central potential ,",
    "and we anticipate the ground state to have s - wave symmetry , then all the basis states have this symmetry as well . thus ,",
    "if we use the hydrogen bound states as a basis set , then the label ` @xmath23 ' will denote the principal quantum number @xmath23 , and @xmath15 .",
    "writing @xmath24 and taking inner products with each ( orthonormal ) basis state and the schrdinger equation written in this basis results in@xcite the matrix equation @xmath25 this represents an infinite dimensional matrix equation , so to make progress we truncate at @xmath26 , vary this maximum number , and monitor the convergence of the ground state energy , for example .",
    "the required matrix elements are @xmath27 the simplest way to proceed is to rewrite the hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ z0_ham ] ) , as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the actual hamiltonian for hydrogen ( first two terms in second line ) and @xmath30 is the remaining term .",
    "we begin with the diagonal terms , @xmath31 . because @xmath32 is an eigenstate of the hydrogen hamiltonian ,",
    "these terms simplify drastically : @xmath33 here we have used the results for the energy levels of hydrogen ( @xmath34 ) , and the well known result@xcite @xmath35 .",
    "because the individual @xmath32 are orthonormal eigenstates of @xmath29 , the off - diagonal terms reduce to a simple inner product , @xmath36    knowing the eigenstates for hydrogen , these integrals are individually straightforward .",
    "a general formulation requires the wavefunctions of hydrogen:@xcite @xmath37 ^ 3 } } e^{-\\frac{r}{na_0}}\\biggl(\\frac{2r}{na_0}\\biggr)^l\\biggl[l^{2l+1}_{n - l-1}\\biggl(\\frac{2r}{na_0}\\biggr)\\biggr]y^m_l(\\theta,\\phi ) \\\\",

    "these are then substituted into the inner product in eq .",
    "( [ off_diag ] ) .",
    "the angular integral can be done immediately , as there is no angular dependence , and this eliminates the @xmath38 ; furthermore , note that hereafter the letter ` m ' denotes a principal quantum number ( not the azimuthal quantum number which is now always zero ) : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is simply a number .",
    "this integral can be done numerically . alternatively",
    ", an analytic solution to the integral is achieved@xcite by writing out the associated laguerre polynomials as a ( finite ) power series.@xcite using this series makes the required integral elementary , so we end up with @xmath41 which is simply a number .",
    "thus , the off - diagonal results for the hamiltonian are : @xmath42    following the philosophy of ref . - ",
    "@xcite , we can simply determine the hamiltonian matrix up to some maximum cutoff , @xmath26 , and diagonalize it to determine the ground state energy .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in fig .",
    "( [ fig1]a ) we see that as we increase the size of the matrix for different values of @xmath1 , the ground state energy does converge ( almost immediately ) .",

    "as already mentioned in the introduction , the bound state eigenstates for hydrogen , while infinite in number , do not actually form a complete basis set .",
    "we should not have expected to get the correct result . on the other hand , truncating the hilbert space has worked in previous studies of one and three dimensional problems.@xcite the problem here is that as we increase @xmath1 , we are trying to describe an atom whose electron is more tightly bound than in hydrogen ( note that @xmath52 . but utilizing the bound excited states attempts to make use of states that are _ more extended _ , not less extended . note that for @xmath48 the calculation is more accurate . however , in fig .",
    "( [ fig1]c ) we show an expanded view of the result for @xmath49 , and even here the matrix result disagrees with the exact result by a small but definite amount . a closer examination of the entire low @xmath1 region is provided in fig .  ( [ fig1]d )",
    "and we see that the error has a maximum about halfway between @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the relative success in this region is because physically we are trying to construct a state that is more extended compared to hydrogen , and the excited states are helpful in producing this .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath55 we require the continuum states as well , as they are perfectly capable of describing a more closely bound state ( recall that an infinite set of plane waves can describe a @xmath56-function ) .",
    "we demonstrate this in the next section .    it should be noted that for the sake of pedagogy a different tact could have been followed .",
    "one could imagine wanting to solve for the ground state of @xmath2 , not in terms of the bound eigenstates of hydrogen , but in terms of hydrogenic states with nuclear charge @xmath57 , where the subscript ` ref ' is short for ` reference ' .",
    "this is more artificial then the problem already considered , but it is instructive to consider anyways , and we do so in the appendix .",
    "once we recognize the need to include the continuum states in the correct description , it immediately becomes difficult to formulate this problem as a finite - sized matrix diagonalization problem . here",
    ", however , we know the exact solution , so it is still possible to determine the degree to which each basis state contributes to the overall solution ; this will clearly vary with @xmath1 . with the radial part of the wave function denoted by @xmath58",
    "( [ z0_groundstate ] ) ] , the correct spectral decomposition is given by @xmath59 where the @xmath60 and @xmath61 coefficients can be determined by overlap integrals ( assuming the left - hand - side is known ) , and these refer to the discrete ( @xmath23 ) and continuum ( @xmath62 ) components , respectively .",
    "note that in both cases symmetry considerations require only @xmath63",
    ".    the procedure will be most familiar for the discrete coefficients , so we begin with these .",
    "we take overlap integrals of hydrogenic wave functions ( with @xmath0 ) with the exact wave function , i.e. @xmath64 the radial wave function @xmath65 can be written in terms of an associated laguerre polynomial , which has a known finite polynomial expansion;@xcite then the integral in eq .",
    "( [ abound ] ) can be readily done , and what remains are finite sums which one can recognize as binomial expansions .",
    "the final result is @xmath66 note the explicit factor of @xmath67 in front of the second term ; for @xmath53 , the only non - zero coefficient is the @xmath14 term , with coefficient unity , as must be the case . for @xmath68 ,",
    "all other @xmath21-states contribute with diminishing amplitude as @xmath23 increases .",
    "a numerical summation of the probabilities @xmath69 over all values of @xmath23 reveals that these do not sum to unity ( when @xmath68 ) , i.e. a finite contribution must come from the continuum states .",
    "the continuum states for @xmath63 are denoted @xmath70 , where @xmath62 is a continuum momentum .",
    "these eigenstates for the hydrogen atom are less familiar to students , but they are given in standard undergraduate texts:@xcite @xmath71 where we have written this for general @xmath72 but require only @xmath0 , and @xmath73 is the so - called kummer function,@xcite and @xmath74 is the so - called pochhammer symbol . note that @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , for example .",
    "equation ( [ cont_radial ] ) is a general solution , and is connected to the laguerre polynomials that describe the radial bound state wave functions.@xcite    the standard@xcite normalization condition for the continuum states , @xmath77 determines the coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ cont_radial ] ) . by utilizing the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ kummer ] ) we can evaluate the overlap integral required to obtain the coefficient @xmath61 , for @xmath0 , @xmath78 ^ 2}\\sqrt{2 \\pi pa_0 \\over 1 - e^{-{2 \\pi \\over pa_0 } } } \\exp{\\biggl[-{2 \\over pa_0 } { \\rm tan}^{-1}\\bigl ( { pa_0 \\over z_0 }   \\bigr)\\biggr]}. \\label{ap}\\ ] ] these coefficients , when squared , show a distribution peaked around @xmath79 , as expected .",
    "since these enter linearly in the wave function expansion given in eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) , we show in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) the amplitudes , @xmath80 vs. @xmath81 for a variety of values of @xmath1 , showing how contributions from the continuum peak near @xmath82 .",
    "the larger @xmath1 , the larger is the contribution from the continuum states .    to sum the continuum contributions one requires a factor of @xmath83 to account for the enumeration of continuum states ; then the contribution from the all the continuum states is @xmath84    the contributions from the various states to the ground state are displayed in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "we have checked that for all @xmath1 the contributions sum to unity .",
    "note that for @xmath85 the continuum states play an increasingly important role .",
    "let us repeat the reason , now that we fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) . in this regime",
    "the actual wave function , given by eq .",
    "( [ z0_groundstate ] ) , varies on a scale of @xmath4 . for @xmath85 none of the bound states can provide structure on such a scale",
    "; as @xmath23 increases the hydrogenic basis states become more extended , not less .",
    "the only source of variation on this scale is the spectrum of continuum states , and these are readily utilized .",
    "the degree to which different continuum momentum eigenstates contribute is illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) , where we show the wave function given by eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) for a particular example , @xmath86 , but with the momentum integration cut off at increasing values of momentum .",
    "as compared with the exact wave function it is clear that initial components ( near @xmath87 ) first fix the large @xmath88 behavior ( the bound states produced a value that was too high for @xmath89 ) and components with larger value of momentum then begin to produce larger amplitude near the origin .",
    "this figure demonstrates explicitly what we were just explaining , that finer scale contributions were necessarily produced by the continuum states .",
    "this example serves to show how a ` poor ' basis choice ( i.e. using the hydrogenic set for @xmath0 rather than for @xmath90 ) can require the use of the continuum states . for the case of a single electron bound to a positive charge , a ` poor ' choice can obviously be avoided .",
    "however , in the case of many electron problems where locally one can have either a single electron or two electrons , it is very difficult to devise a basis set that diagonalizes both scenarios.@xcite",
    "we have used one of the simplest yet realistic quantum systems , the electron configuration in a hydrogen - like atom , to demonstrate a principle with which most students are familiar , but likely few have encountered in practice : the need for a complete basis set to describe properly a quantum mechanical system .",
    "the hydrogen - like atom serves as a good system to show this , since we know the exact solution , and hence know in advance the correct answers .",
    "we can also do most of the required integrals , both for the matrix formulation , and for the spectral decomposition .",
    "the matrix formulation did _ not _ work , perhaps counter to what some might expect .",
    "the implication of this failure , that continuum states are necessary , was reinforced by carrying out a spectal decomposition .",
    "this result , portrayed in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) , perhaps runs counter to our intuition , that bound states require a partial amplitude ( that can be substantial ! ) corresponding to continuum states , i.e. states in which the particle is free to roam through all space",
    ". we also provided a physical understanding of why these states were especially required when we attempt to construct states that are _ more tightly _ bound than provided by the bound basis functions , as demonstrated explicitly in fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "we thank don page and bob teshima for helpful discussions concerning the treatment of the continuum states .",
    "this work was supported in part by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada ( nserc ) , by the alberta icinano program , and by a university of alberta teaching and learning enhancement fund ( tlef ) grant .",
    "as in section [ ii ] we wish to solve for the hamiltonian @xmath92 but we now rewrite this using a slightly different decomposition : @xmath93 the motivation is that we need more tightly bound wave functions to describe ultimately the ground state for @xmath2 .",
    "but if @xmath94 then many of the bound states will actually be more ` compact ' compared to the ground state we are seeking to find . therefore ,",
    "proceeding as before , we begin with the diagonal terms , @xmath31 , to obtain @xmath95 here we have used the results for the energy levels of a hydrogenic state with nuclear charge @xmath57 : @xmath96 , and the generalization of the well known result@xcite @xmath97",
    ".     system with @xmath98 , vs. @xmath57 .",
    "this calculation was performed by diagonalizing a @xmath99 matrix , and shows that using larger values of @xmath57 is effective to a degree .",
    "results are definitely more accurate than using @xmath100 for example , but the convergence to very accurate results is very slow . ]      now we can simply diagonalize an @xmath103 matrix for some @xmath57 . in fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) we show the ground state energy obtained in this way for a targeted system with @xmath98 .",
    "use of the usual hydrogen states with @xmath100 produces a very poor result , @xmath104 , compared to the exact result , @xmath105 .",
    "as we increase @xmath57 the result becomes more accurate , and of course exact as @xmath106 . for larger values of @xmath57 the result first deteriorates before steadily improving as @xmath57 continues to increase towards @xmath107 , as shown .",
    "while the convergence is quite slow , nonetheless this exercise demonstrates that using large values of @xmath57 allows one to get reasonably accurate results for the reason that the bound state basis set now contains quite a number of wave functions that describe a particle confined to the origin .",
    "nonetheless , the lack of better accuracy is an indication that a continuous set of continuum states in the end offers more flexibility than a discrete set of bound states .",
    "note that we did not require values of @xmath108 in excess of about @xmath109 to achieve converged results for all values of @xmath57 shown .",
