    "photoproduction of the hypertriton can provide new information on the @xmath2 interaction , which up to now is only poorly known from the available @xmath2 scattering data .",
    "being the lightest hypernucleus , the hypertriton is obviously the first system in which the @xmath2 potential , including the interesting @xmath3-@xmath4 conversion potential , can be tested in the nuclear environment .",
    "this is also supported by the fact that neither the @xmath5 nor the @xmath6 interactions are sufficiently strong to produce a bound two - body system .",
    "therefore the hypertriton will play an important role in hypernuclear physics , similar to the deuteron in nuclear physics .",
    "although hypernuclear systems have been extensively studied for a wide range of nuclei by means of hadronic processes such as stopped and low momentum kaon induced reactions , @xmath7 , as well as @xmath8 reactions , electromagnetic productions will , at some point , be required for a complete understanding of hypernuclear spectra .    in this work",
    "we investigate the reaction @xmath9 , i.e. the incoming real photon interacts with a nucleon ( proton ) in @xmath1he creating a lambda which combines with the other two nucleons to form the bound hypertriton and a positively charged kaon which exits the nucleus . to our knowledge , no analysis has been made and no experimental data are available for this reaction .",
    "the only related work is due to komarov _",
    "@xcite , who investigated the complementary reaction , @xmath10h , and estimated that at an incident proton energy @xmath11 = 1.13 - 3.0 gev , the maximum differential cross section is well below 1 nb / sr .",
    "in our formalism , the @xmath1he wave functions are expanded in orbital momentum , spin , and isospin of the pair ( 2,3 ) and the spectator ( 1 ) with the notation @xmath12 where @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) denotes the momentum of the pair ( spectator ) and @xmath15 stands for numerical solutions of faddeev equations using the realistic nucleon - nucleon potential @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hewf ] ) we have introduced @xmath16 to shorten the notation , where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the total angular momentum , spin , and isospin of the pair ( 2,3 ) , while for the spectator ( 1 ) the corresponding observables are labelled by @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath21 , respectively .    for the hypertriton",
    "we choose the simple model developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which should be reliable enough to obtain a first estimate for the photoproduction of the hypertriton . using the same notation as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hewf ] ) the wave function may be written as @xmath22 where @xmath15 is given by the two separable wave functions of the deuteron and the lambda , @xmath23 , with the lambda part of the wave functions obtained by solving the schrdinger equation for a particle moving in the @xmath3-@xmath24 effective potential .    while using this simple wave function for most calculations , we also compared with the results for the correlated faddeev wave function of ref .",
    "@xcite in order to probe the sensitivity of the cross section to different descriptions of the hypertriton . in spite of a more complicated structure , the wave function may still be written in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hewf ] ) .",
    "in the lab system the cross section for kaon photoproduction off @xmath1he is @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 represent the momentum of kaon , photon , and the total energy in the c.m .",
    "system , respectively .",
    "since both initial and final states of the nucleus are unpolarized , the sums over the spin projections can be performed by means of @xmath29 , with @xmath30^{(\\lambda)}_{m_{\\lambda } } \\biggr ] , ~ \\label{eq : tfi3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 , i.e. the spin - independent and spin - dependent elementary amplitudes @xcite . since the tensor @xmath33 contains complicated functions of the integration variables @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tfi3 ] ) has to be performed numerically .",
    "the tensor operators , @xmath36^{(\\lambda ) } _ { m_{\\lambda}}$ ] , which determine the specific nuclear transitions in the reaction , are given in ref .",
    "in contrast to the case of pion production off @xmath1he @xcite , the tensor operators in our case are simplified by the approximation that the hypertriton wave function only contains the partial wave with @xmath37 .",
    "however , for future studies involving all partial waves of the advanced hypertriton model @xcite , the complete operator will be needed . for this purpose ,",
    "we have also derived the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tfi3 ] ) for the more general case @xcite .",
    "as a check of our calculations and computer codes , we compare the full result with two simple approximations .",
    "first , we reduce the cross section by allowing only @xmath18waves to contribute to the amplitudes in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tfi3 ] ) . in this approximation",
    "we obtain @xmath38 where the tilde denotes the integration over the internal momenta @xmath13 and @xmath34 weighted by the two wave functions . at @xmath39 gev the elementary reaction model of ref .",
    "@xcite yields a maximum cross section of about 500 nb / sr .",
    "hence , the corresponding cross section on @xmath1he will be about 1 nb / sr at most .    as a second approximation ,",
    "we consider the struck nucleon inside @xmath1he as having a fixed momentum . therefore",
    ", the @xmath17 and @xmath40 amplitudes can be factored out of the integral and the cross section off @xmath1he may be written in terms of the nuclear form factor @xmath41 and the elementary differential cross section , @xmath42 where @xmath43 represents the kinematical factor given , i.e. , in ref .",
    "the result is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffq2 ] . the nuclear cross section at forward angles is smaller than in the case of elementary kaon production by two orders of magnitude . as @xmath44 increases",
    ", the cross section drops quickly , because the momentum transfer to the nucleus increases as function of @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the cross section is very small .",
    "the underlying reason is the lack of high momentum components in the @xmath45 wave function . since the momentum transfers are high , the lambda momentum is high as well , which inhibits hypernuclear formation .",
    "figure [ fig : ffq2 ] also shows the significant difference between the cross sections calculated with the approximation of eq .",
    "( [ msabit ] ) and the full result obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : cssimple ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the _ factorization _ approximation .",
    "it can be seen that in the full calculation the integrations of both spin - independent and spin - dependent amplitudes over the internal momenta lead to destructive interferences and a further reduction of the cross section .",
    "in contrast to our previous conjecture , fig .  [",
    "fig : varwave ] shows the significance of the higher partial waves which reduce the cross section by a factor of more than three .",
    "the reason can be traced back to eq .",
    "( [ eq : tfi3 ] ) . in spite of its small amplitude , the transition from @xmath46 to @xmath47 may not be neglected , since @xmath48 is the most likely state in the hypertriton .",
    "we also note that the angular momentum part of the tensor amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tfi3 ] ) yields a considerably large contribution for this transition . in comparison ,",
    "the higher partial waves in pion photo- and electroproduction decrease the cross section by at most 15% and 20% , respectively .",
    "since the @xmath49 process is a high momentum transfer process and the simple analytical hypertriton wave function used until now contains no short - range correlations , we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig : varwave ] a comparison with the correlated three - body wave function of ref .",
    "@xcite that includes a proper short - range behavior . while the cross section obtained with the faddeev wave function shows more structures , the differences are only of order 10 - 20@xmath50 .",
    "the absence of short - range correlations in the simple hypertriton model does only become obvious for much larger momentum transfers .",
    "the small size of the cross section obtained raises the question of a possible significance of two - step processes , such as @xmath51 .",
    "two - step processes were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite for pion photoproduction on @xmath1he and found to be significant only at @xmath52 much larger than in our case .",
    "@xcite also included these processes in @xmath53 photoproduction on the deuteron and found small effects .",
    "we have investigated the contribution of non - localities generated by fermi motion in the initial and final nuclei . as in former studies",
    "@xcite , an exact treatment of fermi motion is included in the integrations over the wave functions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tfi3 ] ) , while a local approximation can be carried out by freezing the operator at an average nucleon momentum @xmath54 , where @xmath55 in this case .",
    "a value of @xmath56 corresponds to the _ frozen nucleon _",
    "approximation , whereas @xmath57 yields the average momentum approximation .",
    "the latter case has been shown to yield satisfactory results for pion photoproduction in the @xmath58- and @xmath59-shells @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : varfm ] compares the cross sections calculated in the two approximations with the exact calculation .",
    "there appears a systematic discrepancy between the calculation with fermi motion and the one with the average momentum approximation at all energies .",
    "unlike in pion photoproduction , the average momentum approximation can not simulate fermi motion in kaon photoproduction , and the discrepancies between the different methods , especially near forward angles , are too significant to be neglected .    finally , we show the effect of different off - shell assumptions on the cross section in fig .  [",
    "fig : varos ] .",
    "the nucleons in the initial and final states are clearly off - shell .",
    "however , the elementary amplitudes are constructed for on - shell nucleons in the initial and final states .",
    "for this reason , we test the prescriptions given in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. we assume that ( 1 ) the initial nucleon is on - shell and the final hyperon off - shell , and ( 2 ) the final hyperon is on - shell and the initial nucleon off - shell .",
    "both assumptions are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : varos ] , where we see that the difference is not too significant .",
    "the largest discrepancy of 10% occurs at @xmath60 mev in the forward direction as was also observed in the case of pion photoproduction .    in conclusion , we find that the hypertriton photoproduction could provide a sensitive test of the hypertriton wave functions .",
    "the small cross sections and the required high resolution measurements would become a new challenge to experimentalists .",
