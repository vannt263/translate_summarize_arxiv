    "< , < , < , < \" , ]      in the present framework , we first pick up a stable initial density distribution for a concerned nucleus , e.g. , @xmath52sn , as is done for most qmd model studies .",
    "this density distribution is generally not the ground state for the nuclear interaction used , so the nucleus suffers from collective oscillation in its excited state  @xcite , among them is the gmr mode . as gmr is a compression mode in radial direction , we take the root - mean - square ( rms ) radius of the nucleus as its monopole moment @xmath53 at each time step  @xcite , as is shown by the solid line in fig .",
    "one sees that the rms radius shows good oscillation structure , i.e. , the gmr mode .",
    "however , the oscillation damps quickly due to the dissipation effect from both the mean - field potential and the nucleon - nucleon scatterings  @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the period and the decay of the gmr oscillation leads respectively to the peak energy and the width of the gmr spectrum , which can still be hardly reproduced simultaneously  @xcite . in the present study ,",
    "we use @xmath3pb as a target and the concerned nucleus as the projectile . in this way ,",
    "the strength , period , and damping of the gmr oscillation are thus modified by the coulomb interaction between the projectile and the target , as shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that with coulomb interaction , the rms radii have a larger amplitude and a little longer oscillation period with the increasing of the beam energy and become larger on average in the later stage .",
    "overall , a good oscillation behavior of the rms radius in relative long time scale is the key to form a gmr mode .",
    "of course , considering the stability of time evolution of the rms radius in the present model , we calculate the gmr spectra by 200 fm / c .    by applying the fourier transformation to the second - order derivative of @xmath53 with respect to time @xmath54",
    "one can get the spectrum of probability for energy @xmath55 as follows @xmath56 as mentioned above , we set the stopping time of the monopole moment ( @xmath57 ) as 200 fm / c in the present calculation . from a gaussian fit to the spectrum of gmr , one can get the peak energy @xmath58 , the fwhm @xmath59 , and the strength @xmath60 of gmr .",

    "@xcite in fig .",
    "[ sn - exp - cal ] .",
    "note that there are one major different point which we should mention in this comparison between our calculation and the data . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the gmr data are taken from the excited sn nucleus by inelastic scattering of 400-mev @xmath35 particles at extremely forward angles . however , in our calculation , the gmr comes from the excited oscillation of sn nucleus as the initial density distribution is not the ground state of the nuclear interaction used .",
    "the reason is based on the following consideration : ( 1 ) it is not an easy task to treat inelastic scattering of @xmath35-particles in our iqmd model even though the data is available ; ( 2 ) the peak energy and the fwhm are determined by the intrinsic properties of the nucleus and independent of how the gmr mode is excited . consequently , we have to take a compromise for the comparison , i.e. , taking the gmr for the same excited nucleus but with different reaction mechanism , with the strength @xmath60 of gmr from our calculation scaled by that from the experimental data . in this background",
    ", we introduce the parameters used in our calculations as follows : incident energy @xmath62 mev / nucleon , impact parameter @xmath63 fm , the soft eos with mdi , @xmath64 mev , and @xmath65 .",
    "although the condition of our calculation is different from that of the experiment in ref .  @xcite as mentioned above , one can see that our results from the oscillation of excited nuclei modified by the coulomb interaction show a reasonable agreement with the inelastic @xmath35 scattering experimental data , i.e. , giving a similar peak energy but a slightly larger fwhm .",
    "the calculated result of @xmath52sn shows a better agreement with the experimental data than that of @xmath61sn .",
    "the results indicate that the iqmd model is suitable for the study of gmr by considering the rms radius as its monopole moment .",
    "the sensitivities of the peak energy , the fwhm , and the strength obtained by a gaussian fit to the gmr spectrum have been explored .",
    "the sensitivity of these quantities to the impact parameter for @xmath52sn is given in fig .",
    "[ b - dep ] .",
    "it shows that the gmr results do not change much with the increasing impact parameter .",
    "this is understandable as the effect of coulomb interaction is not affected by much when the impact parameter changes from 25 fm to 40 fm .",
    "figure  [ e - dep ] shows the incident energy dependence of gmr results for @xmath52sn . with the increase of the incident energy , the peak energy of gmr decreases , while the fwhm and the strength of gmr increase .",
    "this behavior can be understood by the oscillation of rms radii at different beam energies as shown in fig .",
    ". as we know , the longer oscillation period corresponds to the lower frequency , i.e. lower energy , while the higher amplitude corresponds to the larger strength .",
    "[ rms ] tells us that with the increasing of beam energy , gmr monopole moment has a little longer period but a larger amplitude , which results in a decreasing peak energy and an increasing strength of gmr as shown in fig .",
    "[ e - dep ] . from the above discussions",
    ", it is seen that although the gmr oscillation is already there for a nucleus alone , it can be slightly modified by the coulomb interaction with different incident energies and impact parameters .",
    "many previous works indicated that the eos associated with the nuclear incompressibility @xmath66 has an important influence on gmr , i.e. , the peak energy of gmr can be used to constrain @xmath66 . by adjusting the parameters of eos in table .",
    "[ table1 ] used in the iqmd model , the eos dependence of gmr parameters for @xmath52sn can be explored .",
    "the sensitivity of the gmr results to the eos are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ eos - dep ] , where a significant dependence of the gmr peak energy on the eos can be seen .",
    "in general , the hard eos gives a higher peak energy than the soft one , and so does the eos with mdi . in this sense ,",
    "a soft eos with mdi can reproduce the results from a hard eos without mdi .",
    "similar results on giant or pygmy dipole resonance are seen within the same model @xcite . by comparing the calculated results with the experimental data  @xcite",
    ", one can see that the soft eos with mdi shows the best agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the gmr results may also be affected by the nuclear symmetry energy which is important in understanding the structure of neutron- or proton - rich nuclei and the reaction dynamics of heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "again we use the extreme values of @xmath47 and @xmath46 to illustrate the sensitivity of the gmr results to the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "the dependence of the gmr results on the parameter @xmath47 is shown in fig .",
    "[ csym - dep ] .",
    "when @xmath47 changes from 16 mev to 64 mev , the peak energy of gmr shows a decreasing behavior , the fwhm of gmr increases , and the strength of gmr slightly decreases .    the @xmath46 dependence of the gmr results is shown in fig .",

    "[ csym - dep ] and [ gamma - dep ] can be understood from the above formulae .    the gaussian wave - packet width @xmath0 ( in eq .",

    "actually , in some models like an extended quantum molecular dynamics ( eqmd ) model  @xcite and a fermionic molecular dynamics ( fmd ) model  @xcite , @xmath0 is treated as a dynamical variable . in our iqmd model ,",
    "we use a similar mass - number dependence of @xmath0 as in ref .",

    "@xcite , where the projectile and target have their own @xmath0 before they contact in the heavy - ion reaction process , and after the contact , the projectile and the target gradually melt into one system , and consequently all the particles have a universal @xmath0 .",

    "one can see that the mass - number dependent @xmath0 gives a larger peak energy and shows a stronger mass number dependence of the gmr peak energy than the constant @xmath0 .",

    "[ del - com ] .",

    "one can see that they overestimate the peak energies of gmr by about @xmath90 mev in sn isotopes , and the mass - number dependence of the gmr peak energy seems also weaker than the experimental data .      from the above discussions",
    ", it is seen that introducing only the mass - number dependence to the width of the gaussian wave packet for nucleons in the iqmd model is not sufficient to reproduce the experimental results of the gmr peak energies for sn isotopes . however , considering the correlation between @xmath0 and the peak energy of gmr , we can fit the values of @xmath0 with the experimental data for different sn isotopes .",

    "<S> the isoscalar giant monopole resonance ( isgmr ) in sn isotopes and other nuclei is investigated in the framework of the isospin - dependent quantum molecular dynamics ( iqmd ) model . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of gmr is calculated by taking the root - mean - square ( rms ) radius of a nucleus as its monopole moment . </S>",
    "<S> the peak energy , the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , and the strength of gmr extracted by a gaussian fit to the spectrum have been studied . </S>",
    "<S> the gmr peak energies for sn isotopes from the calculations using a mass - number dependent gaussian wave - packet width @xmath0 for nucleons are found to be overestimated and show a weak dependence on the mass number compared with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is found that experimental data of the gmr peak energies for @xmath1ni , @xmath2zr , and @xmath3pb as well as sn isotopes can be nicely reproduced after taking into account the isospin dependence in isotope chains in addition to the mass number dependence of @xmath0 for nucleons in the iqmd model calculation . </S>"
