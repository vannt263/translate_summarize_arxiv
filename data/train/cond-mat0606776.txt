    "frustration can drive the low - energy physics of bidimensional heisenberg quantum antiferromagnets very far from conventional semi - classical nel - like phases .",

    "however , inside this general frame , the nature of the srvb ground state ( gs ) can be very different from one system to another . in the simplest scenario the spatial symmetry of the hamiltonian",
    "can still be broken , leading to a valence bond crystal phase ( vbc ) characterized by long range order in the dimer - dimer correlation function@xcite .",
    "alternatively , all symmetries can be restored in a flat superposition of srvb states to form a so - called spin liquid ( sl ) .    far from being purely academic",
    ", the precise determination of the gs nature is a crucial question in the context of quantum phase transitions@xcite .",
    "for example , the `` deconfined critical point '' ( dcp ) scenario has been proposed as a new class of criticality to describe the nel to vbc transition@xcite .",
    "more importantly , the nature of the magnetic background dramatically affects the holon / spinon ( de)confinement properties of the corresponding doped systems .",
    "it is therefore believed to be a key ingredient to understand exotic metallic states .    in practice , it is often hard to fully characterize the type , from crystal to liquid , of a srvb phase . in this respect ,",
    "one of the most archetypal example of such a situation is the @xmath3 heisenberg @xmath4 antiferromagnet on the square lattice , where frustration is controlled by the next nearest neighbor interaction @xmath5 . despite many years of numerical and analytical efforts , no definitive picture emerged around the maximally frustrated point @xmath6 , where the magnetic order disappears .",
    "the main point of this article is to introduce a general framework to study this kind of highly frustrated antiferromagnet ( the srvb method ) and to revisit the question on this specific model within an extended version of the hamiltonian including a third neighbor @xmath7 interaction  :    @xmath8     ( color online ) classical phase diagram of the @xmath9 model : * i * nel @xmath10 , * ii * collinear @xmath11 and @xmath12 , * iii * helicoidal @xmath13 , * iv * helicoidal @xmath14 .",

    "the effect of quantum fluctuations on this classical phase diagram is still an open question . in the past 15 years",

    "the situation is much more involved . beside the fact that many approaches ( including spin - wave theory  @xcite , exact diagonalizations  @xcite , series - expansion  @xcite and large-@xmath24 expansions  @xcite ) have now firmly established that quantum fluctuations destabilize the classical ordered ground state and lead to a quantum disordered singlet ground state with a gap to the first magnetic excitation , its precise nature is still controversial  : a columnar valence bond crystal with both translational and rotational broken symmetries  @xcite , a plaquette state with no broken rotational symmetry  @xcite or even a spin - liquid with no broken symmetry  @xcite have been proposed",
    "( see figure [ fig : phases ] ) .    for the @xmath25 case ,",
    "as remarked by ferrer  @xcite , the end point of the classical critical line @xmath26 on the @xmath7 axis is substantially shifted to larger values of @xmath7 when quantum fluctuations are switched on . for the pure @xmath27 model , in this region of large frustration",

    "the complete phase diagram of the @xmath9 quantum antiferromagnet is expected to be even richer . indeed , preliminary calculations  @xcite pointed towards an extended region with a quantum disordered state .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the maximally frustrated region of this phase diagram @xmath29 ( dashed line in figure [ fig : phases ] ) using both exact diagonalizations and a srvb method which consists in diagonalizing the hamiltonian in a subset of singlets states that can be written in term of srvb states . in the first section ,",

    ", we show numerical evidences for an extended non - magnetic phase around @xmath29 . in a third part we present calculations and finite size analysis of dimer - dimer correlation functions and dimer structure factors that establishes the existence of a _ s - wave plaquette ordered phase breaking only translational symmetry when @xmath30 and @xmath29 .",

    "from a numerical point of view , investigating the low energy physics of 2d frustrated quantum antiferromagnets is a difficult problem . among the three well known high precision and controlled methods ,",
    "two of them can not be applied , at least for the moment  : density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) is only efficient in one dimension and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) suffers from a severe sign problem on these systems . the third method , namely exact diagonalizations ( ed ) , consists in a complete enumeration of the hilbert space followed by an iterative solving of the eigenproblem .",
    "the main advantages of this approach are ( i ) it is numerically exact , ( ii ) any observable is accessible ( iii ) spatial symmetries can be fully taken into account thus providing momentum resolved results .",
    "unfortunately , the first step of the method faces the exponential growth of the hilbert space with system size for finite available computing resources .",
    "nevertheless , this method is still widely and successfully used and is the source of many firmly established results .    however",
    ", if one compares highly frustrated quantum antiferromagnets to more conventional unfrustrated ones ( typically nel like ) , a phenomenological review of known results shows that    1 .",
    "the role of the singlet sector is overwhelming at low energy due to the opening of a singlet - triplet gap , 2 .",
    "the breakdown of antiferromagnetic long range order favors the emergence of local singlet patterns .    in this respect , it is tempting to build a more specific approach taking into account these two points in order to systematically reduce the hilbert space to a relevant subset adapted to describe magnetically disordered singlet states .",
    "( a ) arbitrary range vb state .",
    "( b ) nearest neighbor vb state ( nnvb ) .",
    "the oriented bond between two sites @xmath31 and @xmath32 stands for @xmath33 = ( 1/\\sqrt{2 } ) ( \\vert\\uparrow_i \\downarrow_j \\rangle - \\vert \\downarrow_i \\uparrow_j \\rangle)$ ] . ]    following point 1 , a first systematic reduction of the hilbert space could be obtained by directly working in the singlet sector @xmath34 .",
    "unfortunately , ed are not adapted to an explicit implementation of the su(2 ) symmetry of the heisenberg hamiltonian because , from a numerical point of view , eigenvectors of the total spin @xmath35 turn to be very complex objects for large systems . in practice ,",
    "the hilbert space used in ed is a set of @xmath36 eigenvectors .",
    "the expected benefit of such a reduction would be  @xcite of order @xmath37 .",
    "in fact , a natural framework for fixed @xmath35 states has been developed years ago@xcite .",
    "indeed , the whole singlet subspace can be generated using arbitrary range coverings of the lattice with vb states ( see figure [ fig : srrvb ] * ( a ) * )  : @xmath38,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 = ( 1/\\sqrt{2 } ) ( \\vert \\uparrow_i \\downarrow_j \\rangle -   \\vert \\downarrow_i \\uparrow_j \\rangle)$ ] .",
    "however , the practical relevance of these states is very limited because the number of dimer coverings for the complete graph is @xmath39 which is much larger than the size of the singlet subspace . as a direct consequence ,",
    "this family of states is overcomplete .",
    "furthermore it is certainly not specifically adapted to the description of non - magnetic ( quantum disordered ) phases since any kind of singlet state , including the finite - size nel state , could be constructed by an appropriate linear combination of arbitrary range vb states .",
    "let us now examine point 2 .",
    "a simple way to reduce the number of coverings while keeping only short range correlations is to restrict the range of the dimers to short - range , for example nearest neighbor valence bond states ( nnvb ) ( see figure [ fig : srrvb ] * ( b ) * ) .",
    "a general solution to the question of enumerating these states has been given by fisher@xcite .",
    "it is exponential @xmath40 for large @xmath24 , with @xmath41 ( square lattice ) , @xmath42 ( triangular lattice ) and @xmath43 ( kagome lattice ) .",
    "as expected , these numbers are much smaller than the total number of singlets thus providing the desired selection inside the singlet sector .",
    "nevertheless , two important questions deserve attention : ( i ) are these states linearly independent ?",
    "( ii ) which class of singlet states can be obtained by linear combinations of nnvb states ?",
    "the first question has not been addressed analytically but numerical calculations@xcite show that , unless for very small systems on the triangular lattice , these states are linearly independent for the square , triangular and kagome lattices . concerning the second question ,",
    "it is clear that any state involving only short range spin - spin correlations , from vbc to sl , can be captured by srvb states . on the contrary ,",
    "_ showed@xcite that magnetic long range order can not be obtained from linear combinations of such configurations .    as a partial conclusion ,",
    "selecting a subset of srvb states in the singlet space provides a convenient framework to study the low - energy singlet sector of highly frustrated antiferromagnets .",
    "if the physics of a given problem can be captured in this restricted basis , this kind of approach not only makes larger systems accessible to computation but also gives some insights about the nature of the gs ruling out any magnetic long range order . for technical details and illustrations of the method",
    "the reader can refer to previous publications@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , let us recall one of the most salient characteristic of the calculation : one crucial property of srvb states is their non - orthogonality ( see appendix ) .",
    "at a numerical level , the problem of diagonalizing the hamiltonian is then shifted to the so called generalized eigenvalue problem ( gep ) : @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the overlap matrix .",
    "the gep , especially when @xmath46 and @xmath47 are non - sparse matrices , can not be efficiently solved iteratively .",
    "a rather time consuming complete diagonalization has to be performed , which makes use of spatial symmetries necessary for large clusters .",
    "finally , let us remark that the gs computed with this method can be seen as the best variational approximation of the exact gs using the restricted nnvb subset of states .",
    "however , even for a magnetically disordered exact ground state , the wave function almost certainly involves still finite range but more than only nearest neighbor vb states . as a consequence",
    ", this approach is not designed to provide the state - of - the - art variational approximation of the exact gs , but rather to capture in a small subset of physically suggestive states , the main part of the absolute ground state wave function neglecting finite range correlations refinements whose sole effect would be to slightly renormalize energies . in this respect , solving ( [ eq : generalized ] ) is exactly equivalent to diagonalize a sophisticated effective hamiltonian , namely the exact projection of the heisenberg hamiltonian on the chosen srvb subspace .",
    "one of the main drawbacks of the srvb method is its lack of built - in control  : solving ( [ eq : generalized ] ) is always possible even if the selected srvb subspace is irrelevant to describe the low - energy sector of @xmath46 .",
    "it is therefore necessary to make systematic comparisons between srvb results and exact ones .",
    "systematic comparison of ed and nnvb ground state energy for @xmath48 .",
    "the radius of the circles is proportional to the nnvb ground state accuracy @xmath49 .",
    "typical values of the energies are given in table [ tab : energies ] . ]    to do so , let us consider an intermediate size cluster , namely @xmath48 , and compute the gs energy both by ed and nnvb diagonalizations , respectively @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",

    "furthermore , the results of the appendix suggest that the key criterion to discriminate between a pure columnar and a pure _ s - wave _ plaquette vbc , on the basis of dimer - dimer correlations , is the ratio between ( i ) perpendicular bond correlations ( with respect to the reference bond ) and ( ii ) parallel bond correlations in odd columns ( defining the reference bond column as even ) . in the first case it is expected to be equal to 1 while it should vanish in the latter case .    for the data shown in figures [ fig : dimerj2 ] and [ fig : dimerj3 ] , if one considers the most distant bonds from the reference one , the typical value of this ratio is of order @xmath111 and @xmath112 respectively .",

    "in contrast , due to large error bars and the slight concavity of the @xmath129 extrapolation , a vanishing @xmath148 can not be ruled out from our data for @xmath52 larger than 0.3 and therefore the existence of a crystalline long range order for @xmath99 is not proven by the present calculation .",
    "let us now turn to @xmath116 .",
    "the size dependence of @xmath149 does not allow a confident extrapolation to obtain @xmath150 with enough accuracy .",
    "nevertheless , for all clusters @xmath116 is always a very small fraction of @xmath115 as can be seen by comparing figures [ fig : cut ] * ( a ) * and [ fig : col_plaq ] for @xmath48 and @xmath97 .",
    "typically the ratio @xmath151 is of order @xmath111 for @xmath152 and @xmath153 for @xmath154 .",
    "the expected values of this ratio for the pure columnar and _ s - wave _ plaquette state ( see table [ tab : correlationsresult ] ) are respectively 1 and 0 .",
    "we can not draw definitive conclusions from our data in the regime where @xmath155 and @xmath156 since our scaling does not exclude a scenario where @xmath132 and @xmath150 would vanish .",
    "in contrast , on the @xmath157 line for small @xmath5 and up to @xmath158 , the fact that @xmath116 is much weaker than @xmath115 is very much in favor of the _ s - wave _ plaquette scenario with an _ absence of rotational symmetry breaking _ and seems to rule out a simple long range columnar order for which @xmath159 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "note that a small spatial anisotropy of the plaquette phase is still possible .",
    "this scenario where the vertical and horizontal bond amplitudes within the resonating plaquettes are slightly different would indeed lead to a small value of the columnar structure factor in the thermodynamic limit and a gs degeneracy of 8 ( instead of 4 )  @xcite .",
    "comparison between @xmath126 and @xmath149 as a function of @xmath17 along the @xmath160 line .",
    "thin lines with circles  : finite size data for @xmath161 for @xmath48 and @xmath97 .",
    "thick dashed lines are the expectations values of the structure factors @xmath132 and @xmath150 at thermodynamic limit for the pure columnar ( short dashed line ) state @xmath107 and the pure _ s - wave _ plaquette state @xmath108 .",
    "note that @xmath162 in the _ s - wave _ plaquette state .",
    "the thick line with errors bars is the same as in figure  [ fig : cut ] . ]",
    "a careful analysis of the difference in dimer - dimer correlations in a columnar dimer versus an _ s - wave _ plaquette ordered singlet state performed in the previous section yielded strong support for a plaquette phase . in order to directly image the plaquettes in real space",
    "we calculate the following 8-spin correlation function using ed : @xmath163 where @xmath164 and @xmath165 denote two different plaquettes and @xmath166 denotes the cyclic exchange operator of the four spins on a given plaquette .",
    "this correlation function has also been used in a recent study of plaquette order in the checkerboard antiferromagnet  @xcite . if we want to discriminate between a columnar dimer state and a plaquette ordered state in the following , it is useful to note that in a columnar dimer state one has _",
    "two _ distinct expectation values of @xmath167 ( either covering two singlet bonds or none ) , whereas in a plaquette ordered state we expect _ three _ distinct expectation values ( on a singlet plaquette , between two adjacent singlet plaquettes , or sharing the corners of four distinct singlet plaquettes ) .",
    "this number is expected to translate into the number of different values in the correlation function eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : plaquette ] ) .",
    "we present the results obtained by ed on a @xmath48 sample in fig .",
    "[ fig : plaquetteed ] , both along a line with @xmath2 ( upper row ) and along the pure @xmath7 line ( lower row ) . in the cases where strong correlations are seen ,",
    "we basically detect _ three _ different types correlation function values , in agreement with the expectations of the plaquette phase , as pointed out above .",
    "furthermore the spatial structure coincides with the plaquette picture , i.e both the positively and the negatively correlated plaquettes form a distinct @xmath168 superlattice , shifted by the vector ( 1,1 ) with respect to each other .",
    "the evolution of the correlations as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath7 shows that the strength of the correlations both decreases as one moves away from the point @xmath169 either along the pure @xmath7 line or along the line with fixed @xmath2 , in agreement with the results of the preceding section based on dimer - dimer correlations .",
    "interestingly the correlations at the much debated point @xmath170 are rather weak , but still carry some remnants of the plaquette phase , at least for this @xmath48 sample .",
    "an extensive numerical study of the heisenberg @xmath171 antiferromagnet using both exact diagonalizations and a short range valence bond method shows that , in the most frustrated part of the phase diagram ( around @xmath172 ) , the ground state can be captured using only nearest neighbor valence bond coverings of the square lattice .",
    "the emergence at low energy of short range valence bond singlet physics for these parameters and thus the breakdown of magnetic long range order is a direct consequence of the strong frustration of the model .",
    "moreover , we characterize the ground state by an analysis of dimer - dimer correlations , dimer structure factors and plaquette - plaquette correlations and show numerical evidences for an extended valence bond crystal phase around @xmath173 and @xmath174 where the ground state is a _ s - wave _ plaquette state only breaking translational symmetry . as a consequence",
    ", the @xmath27 model provides an example of frustration - driven nel to vbc quantum phase transition .",
    "note that the srvb framework can be readily extended to include singlet pairs beyond nearest neighbors .",
    "however , we believe that this will modify only slightly the results in the maximally frustrated region where the magnetic correlation length is very small . such an approach could nevertheless be useful to investigate properties close to the critical point where the spin correlation length is expected to grow . in that respect",
    "such a transition can be probed by introducing static ( non magnetic ) impurities  @xcite .",
    "again , our framework could be extended to that case  @xcite .    for @xmath175 , including the much debated frustrated phase of the pure @xmath15 model",
    ", the nnvb description of the ground state remains relatively robust . while our results are not able to resolve the controversy around @xmath176 , the inclusion of an additional @xmath7 coupling allows us to put this region into a broader perspective .",
    "we show that an antiferromagnetic @xmath7 is useful in pushing the magnetically ordered phases further apart , therefore leaving more room for the disordered phases , and enabling us to reveal a robust plaquette singlet ordered phase . on the contrary ,",
    "a ferromagnetic @xmath7 interaction will probably lead to a direct first order transition between the @xmath10 and the @xmath12 nel order phases as function of @xmath5 , similar to the classical analysis and numerical results on the related bcc lattice @xcite .",
    "the closeness of the magnetically order phases and the related phase transitions are probably responsible for the enormous difficulty in settling the controversy on the nature of the magnetically disordered phase(s ) of the pure @xmath15 model on the square lattice .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with f.  becca , s.  capponi and f.  assaad .",
    "we thank idris ( orsay , france ) and cscs ( manno , switzerland ) for allocation of cpu - time on the ibm - sp4 supercomputers .",
    "this work was supported by the swiss national fund , manep and the agence nationale de la recherche ( france ) .",
    "in this appendix , we recall some basic overlap properties of vb states and compute dimer - dimer correlations expectation values for columnar and plaquette states .    _ overlaps . _",
    "two vb states @xmath177 and @xmath178 have an non vanishing overlap @xmath179 . to compute this quantity",
    "it is convenient to consider the loop diagram obtained by superimposing both configurations ( see .",
    "figure [ fig : overlap ] ) . because loops are decoupled , @xmath179 is the product of each loop contribution .",
    "since there is only two ways to describe any loop with antiparallel spins , @xmath180 and @xmath181 , the overlap is @xmath182 ( up to a normalization constant ) with @xmath183 the total number of loops .",
    "the normalization is fixed by @xmath184 which diagram contains @xmath185 trivial loops .",
    "the result is then @xmath186 where the sign @xmath187 is due to the relative orientations of dimers in @xmath177 and @xmath178 . in the case of nearest neighbor vb on a bipartite lattice this sign",
    "can be fixed to 1 by convention , but in general this sign can not be considered as constant .      _ orthogonal states in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "_ let us consider two vb states such that the loop diagram contains at least one large loop , namely a loop involving @xmath188 sites with @xmath189 .",
    "the number of remaining sites is @xmath190 so the maximal total number of loops is @xmath191 .",
    "hence , @xmath192 and the overlap goes to zero when @xmath24 goes to infinity .",
    "another class of orthogonal states at thermodynamic limit is formed by states whose loop diagram contains an extensive number of loops @xmath193 ( note that @xmath194 ) .",
    "if @xmath195 , then @xmath196 and the two states are orthogonal when @xmath24 goes to infinity .",
    "_ columnar state and plaquette states .",
    "_ we define the columnar state ( resp .",
    "plaquette state ) as the equal weight linear combination of the four states ( see figure [ fig : trialstates ] ) obtained by translation of the columnar ( resp .",
    "plaquette ) covering of the lattice .",
    "the resulting state has a @xmath110 momentum , thus allowing direct comparisons with the finite size @xmath110 gs discussed in the article .",
    "note that two different plaquette states can be defined on four sites  : one is symmetric upon rotation of the plaquette ( see figure [ fig : annexe ] * a * ) and the second is antisymmetric ( see figure [ fig : annexe ] * b * ) .",
    "we refer to these states respectively as @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the columnar state is denoted by @xmath107 .      using the results of the previous paragraph",
    "we can show that the four components of @xmath107 are mutually orthogonal in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it is easy to check ( see figure [ fig : trialstates ] , top row ) that the overlap diagram have either at least one large loop ( in fact @xmath197 ) or an extensive number of loops .",
    "the case of @xmath108 deserve more attention .",
    "let us define an operator @xmath202 that change the orientation of all the dimers on half of the vertical ( or horizontal ) lines in an alternating pattern .",
    "this operator is trivially self - adjoin and @xmath203 , so @xmath202 is a unitary transform and thus conserves scalar product  : @xmath204 with @xmath205 and @xmath206 . since the action of @xmath207 on a plaquette covering simply exchange @xmath208-plaquettes and @xmath198-plaquettes ( see figures [ fig : annexe ] * a * and * b * )",
    ", the orthogonality of the four components of @xmath108 is shown .",
    "the absence of interference between components of @xmath209 or @xmath109 also occurs in the computation of @xmath210 or @xmath211 where @xmath212 denotes the operator that permutes the two sites of bond @xmath213 and @xmath214 ( see figure [ fig : annexe ] * b * ) .",
    "indeed , the permutation of two or four sites on one component does not affect the existence of either @xmath197 large loops nor an extensive number of loops when overlapping with another component .",
    "_ dimer - dimer correlations . _",
