    "fundamental information for quantifying the strength of correlation effects and their role in magnetic and superconducting ( sc ) properties comes from the determination of the magnitude of quasiparticle renormalization , and its intriguing relationship with the quasiparticle line - shape . in conventional superconductors ,",
    "the most convincing demonstration that electron - phonon coupling is responsible for both dispersion anomalies and superconductivity was obtained from the quantitative correspondence between features in the electronic tunnelling conductance and the phonon spectrum measured by inelastic neutron scattering.@xcite if unconventional superconductivity is mediated by exotic bosons a similar correspondence should hold , even though details of the coupling between these excitations and the quasiparticle state may vary . in cuprates ,",
    "pnictide and heavy - fermion superconductors , the emergence of the sc state near the end - point of static antiferromagnetic ( afm ) nel order makes these materials among the most promising contenders to realize spin - fluctuation mediated pairing.@xcite in heavy fermion systems , coupling of the spin fluctuations to the quasi - localized rare - earth @xmath1-electrons washes out signatures of the dispersion anomaly and complicates the analysis .",
    "similarly , in iron - based superconductors , the presence of multiple bands , multiple gaps and possibly multiple ` hot - spots'@xcite makes such comparative study difficult and ambiguous .    on the other hand ,",
    "single band cuprates should provide a clean system for understanding the microscopic origin of characteristic quasiparticle anomalies in their two - particle spectra .",
    "in particular , the experimental observation of sudden changes or ` kinks ' in the quasiparticle dispersion near @xmath2mev in cuprate superconductors@xcite has raised the hope that the bosonic excitations responsible for these kinks might also mediate electron pairing in these materials",
    ". however , the kink appears at an energy scale where phonons,@xcite polarons,@xcite plasmons,@xcite and spin - fluctuations@xcite can all contribute to its origin .",
    "in fact , significant isotope effects,@xcite lattice coupling,@xcite and charge and spin fluctuations@xcite have all been reported in the kink energy range .",
    "furthermore , poorly understood phenomena associated with underdoping , such as the normal state pseudogap , competition of superconductivity with incommensurate stripe physics , and nematic order which opens a gap over this energy scale make this problem more complex .",
    "the fundamental problem underlying this complexity comes from a lack of consistency between various spectroscopies which are sensitive to different aspects of the ground state , which has hitherto precluded the development of a commonly accepted theory .    here",
    "we go beyond these earlier postulates by performing realistic calculations of the electronic excitation spectra including all channels of spin and charge degrees of freedom in the coexisting spin - density wave ( sdw ) and superconducting ( sc ) ground state.@xcite the calculations reproduce the typical hourglass shape of the magnetic susceptibility , as revealed by inelastic neutron scattering.@xcite we find a new interpretation for this form , with the lower branch associated with scattering of the bogolyubov quasiparticles and the upper branch corresponding to a gapped spin wave spectrum .",
    "these two branches meet to form a magnetic resonance peak at a material specific energy . in turn",
    "this peak interacts with the electronic dispersion via the gw self energy , causing an abrupt break in the dispersion known as the ` low - energy kink ' ( lek ) .",
    "these low - energy bosons are qualitatively distinct from the strongly - correlated paramagnons responsible for the ` high - energy kink'.@xcite we present the doping , temperature , and momentum dependences of the lek for bi@xmath3sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath4 ( bi2212 ) , la@xmath5sr@xmath6cuo@xmath7 ( lsco ) and nd@xmath5ce@xmath6cuo@xmath7 ( ncco ) .",
    "significantly , the present results are consistent with the bosonic spectra found earlier in neutron scattering , resonant inelastic x - ray spectroscopy ( rixs ) , raman scattering , and studies of the optical ` glue ' function , as well as with the excitations responsible for the high - energy kink seen in angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",

    "<S> we present gw based self - energy calculations for the state of coexisting spin - density wave and @xmath0-wave superconductivity in a series of cuprate superconductors . in these systems , the spin resonance spectrum exhibits the typical ` hour - glass ' form , whose upward and downward dispersion branches come from the gapped spin - wave and magnetic scattering of cooper pairs , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the crossover between these two different dispersion features leads to an abrupt change in slope in the quasiparticle self - energy , and hence the low - energy kink commences in the single - particle quasiparticle spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated electron - bosonic coupling strength agrees well with experimental data as a function of temperature , doping and material . </S>",
    "<S> the results demonstrate that the electronic correlations dominate the quasiparticle spectra of cuprates near the low - energy kink , suggesting a relatively smaller role for phonons in this energy range . </S>"
