    "<S> we discuss and present search strategies for finding new thermoelectric compositions based on first principles electronic structure and transport calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate them by application to a search for potential n - type oxide thermoelectric materials . </S>",
    "<S> this includes a screen based on visualization of electronic energy isosurfaces . </S>",
    "<S> we report compounds that show potential as thermoelectric materials along with detailed properties , including srtio@xmath0 , which is a known thermoelectric , and appropriately doped knbo@xmath0 and rutile tio@xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> thermoelectrics are an energy conversion technology that is used in spacecraft power generation , portable coolers and other areas . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the direct thermal to electrical energy conversion provided by this technology and its scalability to low size and power suggests numerous potential applications . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , this is limited by the low efficiency of existing devices , in turn limited by the performance of known thermoelectric materials . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum efficiency is governed by a dimensionless , but temperature dependent figure of merit , @xmath2=@xmath3 , where @xmath4 is absolute temperature , @xmath5 is electrical conductivity , @xmath6 is thermopower ( also known as the seebeck coefficient ) and @xmath7 is the thermal conductivity , usually written as a sum of electronic and lattice contributions , @xmath7=@xmath8+@xmath9 , which is typically a good approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> thermoelectric materials pose a particular challenge to materials genome approaches . </S>",
    "<S> this is because thermoelectric performance , characterized by a figure of merit , @xmath2 , is a contraindicated property of matter . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , standard common models , such as the isotropic parabolic band model , with normal assumptions predict that high @xmath2 will not occur . </S>",
    "<S> this means that very high performance thermoelectric materials have unusual electronic features , a number of which have been proposed and identified as important in various cases . </S>",
    "<S> these include reduced dimensionality , either in artificial structures @xcite or due to details of band formation , and other complex electronic structure characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    most good thermoelectric materials , such as ( bi , sb)@xmath0te@xmath1 , pbte , si - ge , skutterudites and mg@xmath1(si , sn ) are narrow to moderate gap semiconductors . </S>",
    "<S> several papers reporting searches for new semiconductors with thermoelectric potential have been reported . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , there are several thermoelectric materials that do not fit in the category of moderate band gap semiconductors , including some oxides . </S>",
    "<S> oxides can potentially offer a number of advantages for application including perhaps low cost ceramic materials processing . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the high @xmath2 oxide thermoelectrics are na@xmath10coo@xmath1 and closely related p - type layered co and rh oxides , with figures of merit approaching @xmath2@xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the best @xmath12-type oxide thermoelectrics are very different , and the best @xmath12-type @xmath2 values barely exceed 0.5 . </S>",
    "<S> this is found in zno ceramics at very high temperature . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this is an oxide semiconductor with a substantial gap .    </S>",
    "<S> a particular challenge in finding new oxide thermoelectrics is that @xmath2 depends strongly on doping level , among other material parameters , and therefore assessing the potential of a given material requires detailed doping studies . </S>",
    "<S> here we demonstrate some simple measures that can be readily calculated from first principles and used in searching for new oxide thermoelectrics . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose , we use a set of early transition metal and simple oxides , selected with a view to having oxides that are at least potentially dopable n - type , based on the criterion that they either are known to be dopable or that they have the same transition element and similar coordination to a dopable material . </S>",
    "<S> the list includes two known transparent conductors , in@xmath1o@xmath0 and basno@xmath0 , several niobates and titanates as well as bazro@xmath0 for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on high temperature because the thermoelectric performance generally increases with temperature for wide band gap materials , and so if there are any high @xmath2 n - type oxide thermoelectrics in this class , they are likely to have their best performance at high temperatures </S>",
    "<S> . we note that several of these materials have complex heavy valence band structures , which might suggest p - type thermoelectricity . </S>",
    "<S> however , these compounds are all naturally n - type , and p - type doping is unlikely to be feasible ; we do not pursue this further .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculations were performed consistently for all compounds . </S>",
    "<S> the first principles calculations used the general potential linearized augmented planewave ( lapw ) method , @xcite as implemented in the wien2k code , @xcite with well converged lapw basis sets , including local orbitals for semicore states . </S>",
    "<S> experimental lattice parameters were used , while atomic coordinates were determined by energy minimization , subject to the experimental space group symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this was done with the generalized gradient approximation functional of perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe - gga ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite electronic structures were then calculated using the modified becke - johnson potential of tran and blaha ( mbj ) , @xcite which improves band gaps of these materials relative to pbe . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite transport coefficients were obtained from the electronic structures using the constant scattering time approximation and the boltztrap code . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the seebeck coefficients presented are all ceramic averages , defined by @xmath13 , where @xmath5 is the electrical conductivity .    </S>",
    "<S> in order to develop screens for thermoelectric oxides , it is useful to begin with a parabolic band model . for a degenerate doped single parabolic band ( spb ) , effective mass , @xmath14 , </S>",
    "<S> the seebeck coefficient at low temperature ( @xmath15 ) in the constant scattering time approximation is given by    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is measured from the band edge ( note @xmath18 is negative ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath19 increases linearly with effective mass and temperature , and decreases as the 2/3 power of carrier concentration . </S>",
    "<S> the expression in terms of @xmath17 holds more generally for a degenerate doped single parabolic band , regardless of the anisotropy of the effective mass tensor and importantly , when written in terms of the energy , @xmath6 is independent of @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the volumetric density of states is @xmath20 .    </S>",
    "<S> the conductivity for a doped spb under the same conditions is given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is an effective inverse scattering rate . </S>",
    "<S> for an anisotropic parabolic band @xmath23 is replaced by an inverse effective mass tensor and the conductivity tensor takes the anisotropy of this tensor . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath24 , which is in the numerator of @xmath2 varies as @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 generally decreases with both @xmath14 and @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> thus this formula does not mean that high effective mass by itself is sufficient to get high @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> these formulas imply that if one considers different semiconducting compounds one should expect a wide range of doping dependent thermopowers . </S>",
    "<S> this is seen in the left panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - see ] , which shows the doping dependent @xmath6(1000 k ) for the compounds investigated here . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the various compounds appear more similar at fixed energy . </S>",
    "<S> this is seen in the right panel of the figure , which shows the @xmath6(1000 k ) as a function of fermi energy , @xmath17 relative to the conduction band minimum , and also in table [ tab - compounds ] . </S>",
    "<S> the thermopower at fixed fermi level and temperature is relatively constant between the different phases , and in particular there is no correlation with the density of states , @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the outlier compounds in right panel of fig . [ fig - see ] are na@xmath1ti@xmath0o@xmath27 and znnb@xmath1o@xmath28 , for low @xmath6 and orthorhombic nanbo@xmath0 for high @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> orthorhombic nanbo@xmath0 is the polar phase that exists at room temperature but becomes cubic , similar to knbo@xmath0 at high temperature . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the electronic structures of cubic nanbo@xmath0 and cubic knbo@xmath0 are very similar .    </S>",

    "<S> also , as mentioned , most good thermoelectrics have band structures that differ markedly from the single isotropic parabolic band . a computational screen for potential thermoelectrics may then begin by looking for band structures that deviate from the isotropic spb in ways that favor thermoelectric performance . </S>",
    "<S> to understand what kinds of band structures these are , we write the boltzmann transport formulas for the conductivity and thermopower starting with the transport function , @xmath45 where summation over bands is implied , @xmath46 is the band energy and @xmath47 is the band velocity . </S>",
    "<S> then the conductivity and seebeck tensors are @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 is its energy derivative of the fermi function at temperature @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath5 and @xmath6 involve different integrals over the electronic structure . </S>",
    "<S> there are two important aspects that we use here : ( 1 ) at low temperature , eqns . </S>",
    "<S> [ eqn - sig ] and [ eqn - s ] have different integrals over the fermi surface , i.e. the energy isosurface for @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the integrals are such that regions of high @xmath52 are highly weighted in @xmath53 . for a closed isosurface </S>",
    "<S> these are the parts where the span across the surface is small . from this point of view , low dimensional and complex shapes are much superior to simple shapes , such as the spherical isosurface of the isotropic spb . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a cylindrical isosurface is much more favorable than a sphere enclosing the same volume ( number of carriers ) for conduction across the cylinder . as discussed for pbte and related thermoelectrics , @xcite isosurfaces with cylindrical sections in different directions can yield isotropic properties that are far superior to those that would be obtained in an spb with the same carrier concentration . more generally , complex , </S>",
    "<S> corrugated isosurface shapes lead to better thermoelectric performance than the spheres that occur with an spb . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( 2 ) at finite @xmath4 , the factor @xmath54 makes @xmath6 sensitive to the electronic structure over a wider energy range than @xmath5 . as a result , features in the electronic structure such as the onset of a heavy band near @xmath17 can enhance @xmath6 while affecting @xmath5 to a lesser extent . </S>",
    "<S> examples of thermoelectrics with a light band extremum followed by onset of heavy band(s ) include p - type filled skutterudites @xcite and n - type lanthanum telluride . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite polar orthorhombic nanbo@xmath0 is an example of such a case , and this is the reason why it is the outlier with high @xmath6 in fig . [ fig - see ] . </S>",
    "<S> its band structure and density of states ( dos ) in comparison with some other niobates is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - niobate ] . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the dos is similar to p - type pbte , @xcite in contrast to the sharp onsets characteristic of the low dimensional electronic features of the cubic and rhombohedral perovskite niobates ( see below ) . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , as mentioned , nanbo@xmath0 is not in the orthorhombic polar phase at high temperature , and the particular characteristic of a heavy band onset above a light mass cbm is a result of the polar distortion . as such , while it is an interesting illustration of this effect , we do not discuss this compound further .    </S>",
    "<S> most high @xmath2 thermoelectrics have @xmath55 200  300 @xmath56v / k at the temperatures where they are used . </S>",
    "<S> this is readily understood if one applies the wiedemann - franz relation to the electronic part of the the thermal conductivity to obtain @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the lorentz number . </S>",
    "<S> the standard value of @xmath59 yields @xmath2=1 for @xmath60=1 and @xmath6=157 @xmath56v / k , or for a typical @xmath610.5 with @xmath55220 @xmath56v / k . </S>",
    "<S> considering the results shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - see ] , this suggests a rough estimate of @xmath62 0.1 ev for 1000 k. isosurfaces 0.1 ev above the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - fermi ] . </S>",
    "<S> examination of these isosurfaces provides a very simple and fast screen since they are based on the band structure alone . for example </S>",
    "<S> , znnb@xmath1o@xmath28 shows a large complex isosurface . </S>",
    "<S> this is characteristic of a metal , and this is why @xmath6 at fixed @xmath17 is low . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , having a large complex fermi surface at @xmath17=0.1 ev means that the conduction bands are extremely flat in this compound , as is also evident from the high @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> na@xmath1ti@xmath0o@xmath27 shows a near one dimensional metallic structure , while the cylinder for tetragonal pbtio@xmath0 is a two dimensional electronic feature . </S>",
    "<S> these materials will therefore be highly anisotropic , which is not favorable for making a ceramic thermoelectric . </S>",
    "<S> anatase tio@xmath1 has an elongated ellipsoidal shape , which again leads to large conductivity anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the transparent conductors , in@xmath1o@xmath0 and basno@xmath0 have small simple isosurfaces , which according to the arguments above are unfavorable , and this is also the case for pyrochlore y@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath27 .    </S>",
    "<S> the remaining materials have complex isosurfaces anticipated to be favorable for thermoelectric performance . the @xmath63 cubic perovskites and some distorted perovskites , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. rhombohedral knbo@xmath0 and nanbo@xmath0 and @xmath39 catio@xmath0 , have these complex shapes because of the degeneracy of the @xmath64 orbitals in an octahedral crystal field , as was discussed previously for srtio@xmath0 and ktao@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite of the compounds investigated here , cubic knbo@xmath0 , which is the high temperature phase , shows the most perfect low dimensional character in its band structure . </S>",
    "<S> this is seen in isosurfaces consisting of intersecting nearly perfect cylinders for the lowest conduction band ( note that the isosurfaces are a large section consisting of three cylinders joined at the center around @xmath65 and two small sections inside formed by the crossings of the three cylinders ; in general cubic @xmath63 perovskites have a large jack shaped section , as seen in srtio@xmath0 with two small section inside the center of the jack ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , rutile tio@xmath1 also shows a low dimensional character , favorable for thermoelectric performance , with isosurfaces consisting of two intersecting cylinders ( note that two intersecting two dimensional , cylindrical sheets , mean that the conductivity will be three dimensional , and in tio@xmath1 the calculated conductivity anisotropy is weak , as shown in table [ tab - compounds ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the top panels of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - out ] show transport properties for the compounds identified based on the above screen . additionally , in the case of knbo@xmath0 , which contains the 4@xmath66 element nb , we show results of calculations including spin - orbit </S>",
    "<S> . as seen , these are very similar to the scalar relativistic results . the doping range of interest for developing these materials as thermoelectrics at 1000 k ranges from @xmath1110@xmath67 @xmath68 for bazro@xmath0 and cubic knbo@xmath0 to @xmath112x10@xmath69 for tio@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this will shift to lower values for optimization at lower @xmath4 , but as mentioned for these wide gap materials the best performance is likely to be close to the highest temperature at which the material can be used . </S>",
    "<S> the transport function @xmath70 plotted in the top right panel is @xmath71 , where @xmath30 is the volumetric density of states . </S>",
    "<S> the rational for using this particular function is that it is readily computed from the band structure , that the 2/3 power of the dos cancels the mass dependence in the numerator for a spb , and that while scattering depends strongly on the details of a material , the 2/3 power law dependence of the scattering rate on @xmath30 is a reasonable choice for a degenerate doped semiconductor at high temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly a crude measure of the potential electronic behavior of a thermoelectric , since it makes no attempt to incorporate detailed material specific scattering mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> however , it does suggest that knbo@xmath0 may be the best of the materials studied if it can be doped . </S>",
    "<S> also , interestingly , the non - perovskite , rutile tio@xmath1 is within a factor of two of this  best \" material . </S>",
    "<S> anatase on the other hand is not favorable . </S>",
    "<S> the bottom left panel shows the dos for rutile and anatase as compared with srtio@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> as seen , srtio@xmath0 and rutile have a similar sharp 2d - like onset at the cbm , while anatase has a lower , more 3d shape ( for a 2d band , @xmath72 has a step function shape , while for a 3d parabolic band @xmath73 ) . </S>",
    "<S> bayerl and kioupakis have reported theoretical investigation by a somewhat different approach of different tio@xmath1 polymorphs as potential n - type thermoelectrics and also find that rutile is exceptional . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the band structure of tio@xmath1 ( bottom , right ) has a double degenerate bottom conduction band at @xmath74 , with a very flat cbm along the @xmath65-@xmath74 directions . </S>",
    "<S> this underlies the favorable behavior .    from an experimental point of view </S>",
    "<S> , srtio@xmath0 is known to be dopable using nb , and @xmath75 has been reported at 1000 k with 20% nb , @xcite this corresponds to a very high carrier concentration , @xmath113x10@xmath69 , assuming one electron per nb . </S>",
    "<S> the bands at the cbm are ti @xmath66 bands , specifically from the @xmath64 level , which suggests exploration of alternate doping strategies involving the o or sr sites . </S>",
    "<S> srtio@xmath0 , like other perovskites near ferroelectricity , has a low thermal conductivity , which is favorable for a thermoelectric . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the thermal conductivity of nanbo@xmath0 is particularly low at @xmath111 w / mk at 300 k , while knbo@xmath0 has @xmath7610 w / mk at this temperature . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite meanwhile the thermal conductivity of single crystal tio@xmath1 at 300 k is @xmath118 w / mk and falls with temperature to below 5 w / mk at 1000 k. @xcite furthermore it is known that tio@xmath1 can be doped n - type by nb similar to srtio@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    bazro@xmath0 is an insulating material , with a higher band gap than srtio@xmath0 and it is not known whether it can be effectively doped . </S>",
    "<S> cubic pbtio@xmath0 has a ferroelectric transition to the tetragonal form at @xmath11800 k , accompanied by a large @xmath116% lattice strain , which makes it unlikely that practical thermoelectric modules could be made based on this material . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , heavy n - type doping of pbtio@xmath0 may be particularly challenging because of the presence of pb@xmath77 , which might lead to low energy compensating defects associated with availability of the pb@xmath78 valence state .    </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest that in addition to srtio@xmath0 , knbo@xmath0 , and perhaps its alloys such as ( k , na)nbo@xmath0 may be particularly good candidate materials . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that rutile tio@xmath1 is a good candidate and is remarkable in that it is a binary , non - perovskite based compound .    </S>",
    "<S> the key challenge in developing any of these oxides into high performance thermoelectrics will be doping . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned , in srtio@xmath0 and tio@xmath1 doping can be done by nb alloying on the ti site . however , the cbm s have ti @xmath66 character , which means that other doping strategies should be explored . both ytio@xmath0 and latio@xmath0 form in perovskite structure and </S>",
    "<S> so exploration of the solid solutions with srtio@xmath0 would be one avenue . </S>",
    "<S> another would be doping on the o site , perhaps with f.    in the case of tio@xmath1 , the possibilities other than nb doping are more limited , but again it may be possible to use the o site . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with transport measurements on titania doped by oxygen deficiency . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite tiof can be formed in a tetragonal rutile structure , @xcite suggesting that there could be a high solubility of f in rutile tio@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> one issue with tio@xmath1 is the tendency of the binary oxide to oxygen deficiency when processed at high temperature under reducing conditions . </S>",
    "<S> this o deficiency , if large , can lead to ordered phases , ti@xmath79o@xmath80 , known as magneli phases . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite these conducting phases are generally made by reduction of tio@xmath1 at temperatures above 1300 k. @xcite while these phases have several desirable properties for thermoelectrics , so far the thermopowers obtained are too low to obtain high @xmath2 . @xcite it would be important to avoid the formation of magneli phases in assessing doped rutile tio@xmath1 as a thermoelectric . </S>",
    "<S> f doping and avoidance of high temperature anneals in reducing environments may be useful for this . </S>",
    "<S> doping of knbo@xmath0 , or ( k , na)nbo@xmath0 is also expected to be a challenge , although the required doping level is lower than for the other compounds studied . </S>",
    "<S> some possibilities could be divalent substitutions on the k site , such as ba or again f on the o site . in this regard </S>",
    "<S> , it is known that banbo@xmath0 forms in a perovskite structure and is metallic . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    in summary , we present simple screens that can be readily applied in searching for new oxide thermoelectrics and demonstrate them by application to a set of oxides . </S>",
    "<S> this includes a simple screen based on energy isosurface structure . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a visual search strategy . </S>",
    "<S> we find that knbo@xmath0 and rutile tio@xmath1 are interesting compounds to investigate further as potential thermoelectrics in addition to the known thermoelectric compound srtio@xmath0 .    </S>",
