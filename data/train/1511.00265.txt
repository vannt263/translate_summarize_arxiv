    "the dynamic programming approach to the solution of optimal control problems driven by dynamical systems in @xmath0 offers a nice framework for the approximation of feedback laws and optimal trajectories .",
    "it suffers from the bottleneck of the computation of the value function since this requires the approximation of a nonlinear partial differential equation in dimension @xmath1 .",
    "this is a very challenging problem in high dimension due to the huge amount of memory allocations necessary to work on a grid and to the low regularity properties of the value function ( which is typically only lipschitz continuous even for regular dynamics and running costs ) . despite the number of theoretical results established for many classical control problems via the dynamic programming approach",
    "( see e.g. the monographies by bardi and capuzzo - dolcetta @xcite on deterministic control problems and by fleming and soner @xcite on stochastic control problems ) this has always been the main obstacle to apply this nowadays rather complete theory to real applications .",
    "the `` curse of dimensionality '' has been mitigated via domain decomposition techniques and the development of rather efficient numerical methods but it is still a big obstacle .",
    "although a detailed description of these contributions goes beyond the scopes of this paper , we want to mention @xcite for a domain decomposition method with overlapping between the subdomains and @xcite for similar results without overlapping .",
    "it is important to note that in these papers the method is applied to subdomains with a rather simple geometry ( see the book by quarteroni and valli @xcite for a general introduction to this technique ) in order to apply transmission conditions at the boundaries .",
    "more recently another way to decompose the problem has been proposed by krener and navasca @xcite who have used a patchy decomposition based on albrekht method . later in the paper",
    "@xcite the patchy idea has been implemented taking into account an approximation of the underlying optimal dynamics to obtain subdomains which are almost invariant with respect to the optimal dynamics , clearly in this case the geometry of the subdomains can be rather complex but the transmission conditions at the internal boundaries can be eliminated saving on the overall complexity of the algorithm . in general ,",
    "domain decomposition methods reduce a huge problem into subproblems of manageable size and allows to mitigate the storage limitation distributing the computation over several processors . however , the approximation schemes used in every subdomain are rather standard .",
    "another improvement can be obtained using efficient acceleration methods for the computation of the value function in every subdomain . to this end",
    "one can use fast marching methods @xcite and fast sweeping methods @xcite for specific classes of hamilton - jacobi equations . in the framework of optimal control problems",
    "an efficient acceleration technique based on the coupling between value and policy iterations has been recently proposed and studied by alla , falcone and kalise in @xcite .",
    "finally , we should mention that the interested reader can find in @xcite a number of successful applications to optimal control problems and games in rather low dimension .    in parallel to these results",
    "several model reduction techniques have been developed to deal with high dimensional dynamics in a rather economic way .",
    "these techniques are really necessary when dealing with optimal control problems governed by partial differential equations . despite the vast literature concerning the analysis and numerical approximation of optimal control problems for pdes ,",
    "the amount of works devoted to the synthesis of feedback controllers is rather small . in this direction ,",
    "the application of the dynamic programming principle ( dpp ) is a powerful technique which has been applied mainly to linear dynamics , quadratic cost functions and unbounded control space , the so - called linear quadratic regulator ( lqr ) control problem . for this problem",
    "an explicit feedback controller can be computed by means of the solution of an algebraic riccati equation .",
    "however if the underlying structural assumptions are removed , the feedback control has to be obtained via the approximation of a hamilton - jacobi - bellman equation defined over the state space of the system dynamics .",
    "as we mentioned , this is a major bottleneck for the application of dpp - based techniques in the optimal control of pdes , as the natural approach for this class of control problems is to consider a semi - discretization ( in space ) via finite elements or finite differences of the abstract governing equations , leading to an inherently high - dimensional state space .",
    "however , in the last years several steps have been made to obtain reduced - order models for complicated dynamics and by the application of these techniques it is now possible to have a reasonable approximation of large - scale dynamics using a rather small number of basis functions .",
    "this can open the way to the dpp approach in high - dimensional systems .",
    "reduced - order models are used in pde - constrained optimization in various ways ; see , e.g. , @xcite for a survey .",
    "however , the main stream for the optimal control of pdes is still related to open - loop controls based on the pontryagin maximum principle ( an extensive presentation of this classical approach can be found in the monograph @xcite ) .",
    "let us refer to @xcite , where it has been observed that models of reduced order can play an important and very useful role in the implementation of feedback laws .",
    "more recently , the proper orthogonal decomposition ( pod ) has been proposed for pde control problems in order to reduce the dynamics to a small number of state variable via a careful selection of the snapshots .",
    "this technique , coupled with the dynamic programming approach , has been developed mainly for linear equations starting from the heat equation where one can take advantage of the regularity of the solutions to reduce the dimension @xcite and then attacking more difficult problems as the advection - diffusion equation @xcite , burgers s equation @xcite and navier - stokes @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the interplay between reduced - order dynamics , the associated dynamic programming equation , the resulting feedback controller and its performance over the high - dimensional system . in our analysis",
    "we will derive some a - priori error estimates which take into account the time and space discretization parameter @xmath2 and @xmath3 as well as the dimension @xmath4 of the pod basis functions used for the reduced model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ section2 ] we recall some basic facts about the approximation of the infinite horizon problem via the dynamic programming approach .",
    "section  [ section3 ] is devoted to present in short the pod technique and the basic ideas behind the construction of the reduced model . in section  [ section4 ]",
    "we present the main results and our a - priori estimates for the numerical approximation of the reduced model .",
    "these a - priori estimates have been also used in the construction of the algorithm which is described in detail in section  [ section5 ] .",
    "some numerical tests are presented and analyzed in section  [ section6 ] and finally we draw some conclusions in section  [ section7 ] .",
    "in this section we will recall the dynamic programming approach and its numerical approximation for the solution of infinite horizon control problem .      for given nonlinear mapping @xmath5 and initial condition @xmath6",
    "let us consider the following controlled nonlinear dynamical systems @xmath7 together with the infinite horizon cost functional @xmath8 in we assume that @xmath9 is a given weighting parameter and @xmath10 maps @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
