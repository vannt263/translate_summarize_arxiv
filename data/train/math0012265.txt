    "a _ quadriculated surface _ is a juxtaposition of squares along sides forming a surface ( usually with boundary ) such that vertices of squares which lie in the interior of the surface belong to precisely four squares and vertices in the boundary belong to finitely many squares .",
    "a simple example of a quadriculated surface is the _ quadriculated plane _ , @xmath6 divided into unit squares with vertices in @xmath7 .",
    "compact quadriculated surfaces have finitely many squares and will usually be _ bicolored _ and _ balanced _ , i.e. , the forming squares are black and white in such a way that squares with a common side have opposite colors , and the number of black squares equals the number of white squares .",

    "we assume @xmath0 to be a subset of the plane , allowing free use of an orientation of @xmath0 and of its inner and outer boundaries .    let @xmath9 be the set of domino tilings of @xmath0 . for @xmath10 , we draw inside each domino a _ domino arrow _ from the center of the black square to the center of the white square . given @xmath11 , juxtapose the domino arrows from @xmath12 to the reversed domino arrows from @xmath13 : this produces a finite number of oriented simple closed curves .",
    "the _ flux _",
    "@xmath14 of @xmath12 relative to @xmath13 counts such curves with weights @xmath15 , 0 or 1 given by the winding of each curve in the annulus @xmath0 .",
    "flux _ has been chosen for its ( co)homological connotations ; unfortunately , this use of the term is unrelated to that of lieb and loss ( @xcite ) .",
    "the _ flux polynomial _ of @xmath0 is @xmath16 this is a laurent polynomial in @xmath2 which is independent of base tiling @xmath13 , up to multiplication by an integer power of @xmath2 .",
    "[ theo : plus ] all non - zero roots of the flux polynomial @xmath17 are real negative numbers .",
    "furthermore , they are either all equal to @xmath15 or all distinct .    when the roots of @xmath17 are distinct , @xmath15 may or may not be a root .",
    "a tiling @xmath18 induces a bijection @xmath19 from black to white squares . again fixing an arbitrary base tiling @xmath20 ,",
    "let the _ sign _ @xmath21 of a tiling @xmath18 relative to @xmath13 be the sign of the permutation @xmath22 on the set of white squares .",
    "deift and tomei ( @xcite ) pointed out that @xmath15-counting of tilings on disks can only yield very few values .",
    "[ theo : dt ] let @xmath23 be a quadriculated disk with a base tiling @xmath13 .",
    "then @xmath24 equals @xmath25 , @xmath26 or @xmath15 .",
    "the _ signed flux polynomial _ of an annulus @xmath0 is @xmath27 an expression independent of base tiling up to sign and multiplication by a power of @xmath2 .",
    "on quadriculated annuli , @xmath15-counting is also severely restricted .",
    "[ theo : minus ] all non - zero roots of the signed flux polynomial @xmath28 are roots of unity .",
    "actually , we study a more general polynomial , the _ @xmath1-flux polynomial _ of @xmath0 , @xmath29 which enumerates tilings of @xmath0 according to _ volume _ @xmath30 and flux . counting according to volume ( defined in section 4 ) , i.e. , @xmath1-counting of domino tilings , has been considered previously : in @xcite ,",
    "for example , elkies , kuperberg , larsen and propp @xmath1-count tilings by dominoes of the _ aztec diamond _ and macmahon ( @xcite ) already @xmath1-counted lozenge tilings .",
    "the flux polynomials are special cases of the @xmath1-flux polynomial : @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the main ingredient in the proofs is the fact that @xmath3 has two distinct algebraic interpretations .",
    "the first one is rather familiar : @xmath3 is the determinant of a kasteleyn - type matrix @xmath33 ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the second interpretation requires the construction of another matrix : for each flux @xmath34 , the coefficient of @xmath35 in @xmath3 ( a laurent polynomial in @xmath1 ) is the trace of a _ connection matrix _ obtained as follows ( see section 6 ) .",
    "tear @xmath0 along a _",
    "cut _ formed by sides of squares ( as in figure [ fig : tracks ] ) giving rise to a _ periodic track segment _ : a ( topological ) quadriculated rectangle @xmath36 with a marked pair of opposite sides , the left and right _ attachments _ ( see figures [ fig : segtile ] and [ fig : nilpot ] ) .",
    "now , a tiling of @xmath0 almost induces a tiling on @xmath36 : the complication is that the dominoes of the tiling , when drawn so as to fill @xmath36 completely , may trespass the attachments .",
    "our definition of tiling of a track segment shall allow dominoes to trespass attachments ( again as in figure [ fig : segtile ] ) .",
    "we list , for a given value of the flux @xmath34 , all possible ways in which dominoes can trespass the attachment ( the _ indices _ of an attachment ) .",
    "say there are @xmath37 such ways : the @xmath38 connection matrix @xmath39 has for @xmath40-entry the @xmath1-counting of tilings of @xmath36 trespassing left and right attachments in the way prescribed by indices @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "rather unsurprisingly , the connection matrix depends in an irrelevant fashion on the choice of cut .",
    "both kasteleyn and connection matrices are well behaved with respect to taking the quadriculated @xmath43-cover @xmath44 of an annulus @xmath0 .",
    "as we shall see in section 5 , the kasteleyn matrix associated to @xmath44 has for determinant a polynomial @xmath45 whose roots , for fixed @xmath1 , are , up to sign , the @xmath43-th power of the roots of @xmath3 for the same fixed @xmath1 .",
    "thus , we may study the roots of @xmath3 by considering different @xmath43-covers of @xmath0 . for connection matrices ,",
    "the relationship is even simpler : @xmath46 ( section 6 ) . here , @xmath36 is a periodic track segment obtained from @xmath0 by a cut and @xmath47 is the _ juxtaposition _ of @xmath43 copies of @xmath36 , i.e. , the periodic track segment obtained by cutting @xmath44 .",
    "the connection matrix @xmath48 has two useful features .",
    "first , the computation of each entry is a counting of tilings on a disk : indeed , the indices associated to left and right attachments , obtained by the row and column of an entry , indicate how to _ prune _ @xmath36 at the attachments yielding a disk @xmath23 so that tilings of @xmath36 with prescribed indices are tilings of the disk @xmath23 , which are then @xmath1-counted",
    ". we may then apply theorem [ theo : dt ] to infer that , in the case of @xmath49-counting , connection matrices can have very few values for their entries . by finiteness",
    ", there must be different integers @xmath50 and @xmath51 for which , for all possible values of the flux @xmath34 , we must have @xmath52 and hence @xmath53 .",
    "since the roots of @xmath54 are , up to sign , @xmath43-th powers of the roots of @xmath55 , this essentially proves that the non - zero roots of @xmath55 are roots of unity  this is theorem [ theo : minus ] .",
    "the second feature of the connection matrix is the simple fact that , by definition , it has only non - negative entries when @xmath56 .",
    "this permits the study of its eigenvalues ( and thus , its trace ) by making use of the perron theorem for non - negative matrices .    in section 2 , we introduce _ wall - free annuli _ , essentially irreducible quadriculated annuli with respect to the set of tilings . for annuli admitting walls ,",
    "the theorems have more stringent statements , with simple proofs . in this section",
    ", we introduce most of the notation used in the paper and a convenient discrete version of the gauss - bonnet theorem .    in section 3 , we review the basic facts about _ height functions _ ,",
    "algebraic descriptions of tilings of a simply connected quadriculated region ( @xcite ) .",
    "tilings of an annulus @xmath0 give rise to _ periodic _ tilings on @xmath57 , which are then studied as height functions in the _ band _ @xmath57 .    in section 4 , we define _ kasteleyn weights _ on @xmath0 .",
    "this is a modification of kasteleyn s construction ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in more detail ,",
    "cut @xmath0 to obtain a periodic track segment @xmath36 and a _ kasteleyn triple _ of matrices : one accounting for interaction between black and white squares whose common side is not in the cut , and two others which account for interaction of squares across the cut .",
    "the triple is convenient when studying the effect of _ juxtaposition _ and _ closing _ of track segments .",
    "the @xmath1-flux polynomial @xmath3 is the determinant of a matrix obtained in a simple fashion from the kasteleyn triple .",
    "we build up from three simple homomorphisms_flux _ , _ volume _ and _ sign_on the ( additive ) group of 1-cycles on @xmath0 . the homomorphisms have simple combinatorial interpretations and incorporate well the properties required for obtaining @xmath58-counting of tilings out of a determinant . in section 5 , we show how kasteleyn triples and the @xmath1-flux polynomial behave with respect to @xmath43-covers of the annulus @xmath0 .",
    "section 6 describes the connection matrix @xmath59 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ theo : minus ] ends the section .",
    "most of section 7 is dedicated to the positivity of certain matrix entries which is needed to use perron s theorem .",
    "we finally prove the following generalization of theorem [ theo : plus ] .",
    "[ theo : qplus ] let @xmath0 be a wall - free annulus .",
    "let @xmath56 be fixed .",
    "then all non - zero roots of the @xmath1-flux polynomial @xmath3 are distinct , negative numbers .",
    "there is a natural symbolic dynamical context for the results in this paper which shall not be explored in detail ( see @xcite for terminology and basic results ) . for the band @xmath57 ,",
    "let @xmath60 be the set of tilings of @xmath57 with flux @xmath34 ; @xmath60 is a cantor set under a natural sequence space topology . _",
    "translation _ of tilings by one period corresponds to the shift in sequence space and is a homeomorphism from @xmath60 to itself . with this structure ,",
    "@xmath60 is a topological markov chain with transitive matrix and therefore topologically mixing and with a dense set of periodic tilings .",
    "furthermore , translation preserves a certain class of measures constructed taking into account the combinatorics of tilings .",
    "it seems natural to ask if similar results can be obtained for tilings by _ lozenges _ of _ triangulated annuli _",
    "( a lozenge is a juxtaposition of two equilateral triangles along a common side of length 1 ) .",
    "we indicate two significant difficulties .",
    "first , there is no obvious counterpart to theorem [ theo : dt ] . besides",
    ", the technical requirements to prove eventual compatibility , indeed , the very concept of wall , have not , to our knowledge , been sufficiently studied .",
    "another related problem is the study of other surfaces such as tori and surfaces of higher genus with boundary .",
    "this must involve polynomials in more variables to account for the value of the flux across independent cuts .",
    "in the introduction we already presented the concepts of bicolored and balanced quadriculated surfaces . we always consider disks and annuli embedded in @xmath6 but not necessarily in the quadriculated plane .",
    "let @xmath61 be the set of domino tilings of a quadriculated surface @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath63 in @xmath62 is a sequence of adjacent vertices .",
    "a path @xmath64 _ turns left _",

    "right ) of both edges @xmath68 and @xmath69 ; otherwise , if @xmath65 is an interior point in @xmath62 , the path _ follows straight _ at @xmath65 .",
    "more generally , the _ curvature _ of the path @xmath70 at @xmath65 is 1 , 0 or @xmath15 if @xmath65 is in the interior of @xmath62 and the path turns left , follows straight or turns right at @xmath65 , respectively ; if @xmath65 is a boundary vertex , let @xmath43 be the number of squares in the angle @xmath71 : the curvature at @xmath65 is @xmath72 , with the sign depending on the orientation of the angle .",
    "clearly , the definition of curvature at interior vertices can be considered a special case of the more complicated definition for boundary vertices .",
    "a path is _ simple _ if its vertices are distinct and _ closed _",
    "if @xmath73 , and in this case we write @xmath74 .",
    "a _ cut _ is a simple path in a quadriculated annulus joining outer to inner boundary and having exactly one vertex in each boundary component .",
    "we consider an annulus as a circular juxtaposition of quadriculated disks with specified _ attachments_. we draw cuts and call the disks between consecutive cuts _ track segments _ since we imagine the annulus to be a circular track for a toy train .",
    "more precisely , a _ track segment _",
