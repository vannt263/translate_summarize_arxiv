    "recent studies of the role of trans - planckian physics in the hawking effect and in inflationary cosmology have exploited scalar fields with high frequency dispersion as a model of how short distance physics might affect the behavior of quantum fields in such settings .",
    "these models involve a preferred frame in which the distinction between high and low frequency is made .",
    "if such a matter field is to be coupled to the spacetime metric in a generally covariant theory of gravity , the preferred frame must be treated as a dynamical quantity rather than as a fixed background structure .",
    "one way of doing this was formulated by us in a previous paper@xcite , in which the preferred frame is determined by a dynamical unit timelike vector field @xmath0 . using this formulation we obtained an expression for the stress tensor of a scalar field with dispersion .    in the present paper",
    "we use this stress tensor to evaluate the equation of state in flat spacetime for a thermal state of the field . this equation of state",
    "is then used in a fluid description of the matter field in a cosmological model , and the implications for a hot big bang cosmology are examined .",
    "we also investigate under what circumstances superluminal equilibration associated with high frequency dispersion can solve the cosmological horizon problem .    in considering only the flat space thermal state of the matter field",
    "we are adopting an adiabatic approximation which precludes effects related to out of equilibrium phenomena including particle creation in the dynamical background of a cosmological metric such as were considered recently for fields with high frequency dispersion in the context of inflation@xcite .",
    "this is a good approximation for frequencies larger than the expansion rate @xmath1 .",
    "it can therefore be used to study the effects of dispersion for frequencies of order @xmath2 provided @xmath3 .",
    "various possibilities exist for the kinetic terms in the action for @xmath0 . for the purposes of illustration in this paper we choose",

    "for the matter content we are interested in a scalar field with high frequency dispersion @xmath5 $ ] , where @xmath6 is a function that vanishes at zero , and @xmath2 is a constant with the dimensions of inverse length which sets the scale for deviations from lorentz invariance .",
    "it has been suggested that such a modified dispersion relation might arise in loop quantum gravity@xcite , or in string theory or other approaches to quantum gravity , or more generally from an unspecified modification of the short distance structure of spacetime ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "possible observational consequences have been the subject of recent study ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) , and the role of such dispersion in the hawking process@xcite and in the generation of inflationary primordial density fluctuations@xcite have been examined .    absent a reliable theory of such modifications , it makes sense simply to expand in @xmath7 .",
    "we consider here the lowest order modification for a scalar field that is invariant under rotations and analytic in @xmath8 , which is given by (k)^2=||^2 -||^4/k_0 ^ 2 , [ dr ] where @xmath2 is a dimensionful parameter . with @xmath9",
    "this yields a subluminal group velocity , and with @xmath10 it is superluminal .",
    "the pathology at @xmath11 in the subluminal case is irrelevant since ( [ dr ] ) is only regarded as the first terms in an expansion .",
    "when we evaluate the equation of state , we shall impose a cutoff that avoids this pathology .    the dispersion relation ( [ dr ] )",
    "can be produced by adding a term to the action with four spatial derivatives .",
    "previously this has been done in 1 + 1 dimensional models ( for a review see @xcite ) , and recently such models have been generalized to field theory in a background 3 + 1 dimensional robertson - walker spacetime@xcite . here",
    "we extend these models to a general 3 + 1 dimensional spacetime .",

    "the expectation value of ( the hermitian part of ) the operator @xmath25 vanishes , since the operator is odd under time reversal while a thermal state is invariant . using ( [ l ] ) and ( [ udsdurw ] ) this implies that , in the minimal model , @xmath26 .",
    "( if other terms are included in the action for @xmath0 then @xmath27 would not vanish , although it would still not receive contributions from this matter field . ) therefore in this model @xmath28 , so the only contribution to the cosmological stress tensor comes from the scalar field .",
    "consider now the expectation value @xmath29 of the stress tensor ( [ tdisp])or more precisely of its hermitian part  in a thermal state .",
    "note first that time reversal invariance of the thermal state requires an even number of time derivatives of @xmath19 , and spatial isotropy requires an even number of spatial derivatives of @xmath19 , in order for the thermal expectation value not to vanish .",
    "thus terms with an odd number of derivatives of @xmath19 do not contribute .",
    "let us call this the  odd derivative rule \" .",
    "we can use this rule to see that the expectation value @xmath30 vanishes .",
    "integrating by parts , @xmath31 can be expressed as a term that vanishes since @xmath19 satisfies its equation of motion , plus the total derivative of an expression involving only terms with an odd number of derivatives of @xmath19 .",
    "the total derivative can be taken out of the expectation value , hence that term vanishes .",
    "the part of ( [ tdisp ] ) multipled by @xmath32 has three terms .",
    "the expectation value of the first term has a single time derivative , hence vanishes by time reversal symmetry .",
    "the expectation value of the third term is the gradient of an expression with three spatial derivatives which vanishes by the odd derivative rule .",
    "the second term can be integrated by parts , and the resulting total derivative piece has vanishing expectation value by the odd derivative rule , which leaves only @xmath33 . in a thermal state",
    "this must have the form @xmath34 , where @xmath0 is the rest frame defined by the thermal bath . to find @xmath35 we contract with @xmath36 , which yields @xmath37 due to the factor @xmath38 . to find @xmath39 we contract with @xmath40 and divide by 3",
    ", hence this term contributes @xmath41 .",
    "the expectation value of the stress tensor thus takes the form t_ab= u_a u_b + p q_ab , with energy density @xmath42 and pressure @xmath43 given by & = & ^2 [ rho ] + p & = & ( d)^2 -k_0 ^ -2 ( d^2)^2.[p ]    to evaluate the density and pressure we expand the field in fourier components using the dispersion relation ( [ dr ] ) and sum the contributions from the modes , weighting each by the thermal expectation value of the number operator @xmath44 , which yields = , [ rint ] p= .",
    "[ pint ] for low temperatures @xmath45 , only modes with @xmath46 contribute significantly , hence we recover the standard result for massless radiation , @xmath47 , and the energy density scales as @xmath48 .    before looking at the exact temperature dependence ,",
    "let us consider the high temperature limit .",
    "the nature of this limit depends on whether the dispersion is sub- or super - luminal . in the superluminal case @xmath10",
    ", we can sensibly use the dispersion relation ( [ dr ] ) out to arbitrarily large @xmath8 , so in the high temperature limit only wave vectors @xmath49 are relevant . for such wave vectors we have @xmath50 ,",
    "hence the energy density scales as @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . this should be taken only as a qualitative indication of what might occur , since one would expect that for @xmath53 further terms in the @xmath8-expansion of the dispersion relation become important .    in the subluminal case",
    "@xmath9 we must impose a cutoff so as not to enter the unphysical region where the dispersion relation would yield @xmath54 .",
    "we choose to impose the cutoff at @xmath55 , where @xmath56 attains its maximum value .",
    "this is similar to a lattice cutoff for which , in one dimension , the dispersion relation is @xmath57 , and for which @xmath58 exhausts all the independent modes . with this cutoff in place ,",
    "@xmath59 for all modes in the high temperature limit , hence the expectation value of the number operator tends toward @xmath60 .",
    "thus the energy density scales as @xmath61 in this limit . as for the equation of state , the ratio of the integrals yields @xmath62 .",
    "the interpolation between the low and high temperature limits can be determined by a numerical calculation of the integrals . in fig .",
    "[ eos ] we plot @xmath63 vs. @xmath64 .",
    "it is seen that the equation of state smoothly connects the low and high temperature limits . for the subluminal case most of the interpolation takes place over the range of temperatures @xmath65 , while in the superluminal case most of the interpolation takes place over the somewhat higher range @xmath66 .",
    "the modified equation of state derived here can be used in a cosmological model where thermal matter with non - lorentz - invariant dispersion acts as a source of gravity .",
    "the bianchi identity implies the energy - momentum tensor is divergence - free , which for a perfect fluid implies @xmath67 .",
    "together with the equation of state this determines the evolution of the temperature . in the superluminal case",
    "local energy - momentum conservation is also independently implied by the matter field equations as usual , however in the subluminal case the dynamics is not self - contained because of the high wave vector cutoff .",
    "if the cutoff is imposed at a fixed proper wave vector , new modes are added as the universe expands , and the field dynamics does not specify into which state these modes are born .",
    "the assumptions of a thermal stress tensor and of energy - momentum conservation require that , whatever their birth state , they rapidly equilibrate with the rest of the modes .",
    "this is reasonable under the assumption that the system is in the adiabatic regime .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether high frequency dispersion could have any impact on the cosmological problems that led to the invention of the inflationary scenario . in particular",
    ", could it provide a solution of these problems not requiring inflation ?",
    "the modification of the equation of state caused by the dispersion would affect the quantitative details of the evolution of the scale factor at times when the typical wavevectors are of order @xmath2 or greater , which is presumably only in the very early universe .",
    "however , as we have seen , the equation of state only changes from @xmath68 to @xmath69 in the superluminal case and to @xmath70 in the subluminal case .",
    "neither are significant enough to qualitatively change the dynamics or horizon size .      in the superluminal case ,",
    "the fact that influences travel faster than light at wavevectors @xmath71 opens up the possibility of solving the horizon problem via superluminal equilibration .",
    "the coordinate distance covered by a wavepacket with proper group velocity @xmath72 is @xmath73 . for a dispersion relation that goes as @xmath74 at large wave vectors",
    "the group velocity goes as @xmath75 .",
    "it is easy to show that the typical wavevector at the peak of a thermal distribution scales as @xmath76 ( as long as the dispersion relation is homogeneous ) , hence the typical group velocity scales as @xmath77 , so we have @xmath78 . if this diverges then the horizon problem is solved assuming the framework of this model .    with the above dispersion relation ,",
    "the equation of state is @xmath79 , which according to the einstein equation yields the evolution of the scale factor @xmath80 .",
    "thus @xmath81 , which diverges at the lower limit for any @xmath82 .",
    "unfortunately it does not make much sense to view this as a solution to the horizon problem , because most of the @xmath83 is traversed during a regime in which the typical wavevector and energy density are so much larger than the planck scale that we have no reason to trust the semiclassical model at all .",
    "in particular , we have checked that in order for @xmath83 to surpass the horizon size , the evolution must be extrapolated all the way back to a time at which the typical wavevector is roughly @xmath2 times @xmath84^{1/(n-3)}$ ] . presuming that @xmath2 is within a few orders of magnitude of the planck scale , this typical wave vector exceeds the planck scale unless @xmath85 .",
    "since we have no theory that would determine the maximum exponent @xmath86 appearing in a superluminal dispersion relation , it would seem artificial at this stage to adjust @xmath86 in order to achieve a sub - planckian resolution of the horizon problem .",
