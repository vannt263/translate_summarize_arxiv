    "rare decays induced by flavor changing neutral currents can be used as tests of the standard model ( sm ) , and are sensitive to new physics .",
    "it is expected that at future b factories and fixed target machines , other rare decay channels of the bottom quark @xcite will be discovered in addition to the observed @xmath8 transition@xcite .",
    "these processes also offer useful information for extracting the fundamental parameters of the sm , such as @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "rare decays can also serve as alternative channels to measure some elementary hadronic parameters .",
    "for instance , the decay constants @xmath10 , @xmath11 can be extracted from @xmath12 @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the possibility of using the channel , @xmath13 to determine the decay constants .",
    "pure leptonic decays of heavy pseudoscalar mesons into light lepton pairs are helicity suppressed , their branching ratios are of the order of @xmath14 for @xmath15 , and @xmath16 for @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "this makes it difficult to determine @xmath18 from these processes . for @xmath7",
    "the situation is even worse due to the smaller ckm angle .",
    "if a photon is emitted in addition to the lepton pair , then the mechanism of helicity suppression will not hold any longer and larger branching ratios are expected .",
    "although the process @xmath19 is free from helicity suppression and its branching ratio is around @xmath20 in the sm @xcite , it is likely to be compatible with the decays into lepton pairs only when its efficiency is better than @xmath21 .    in section 2",
    "the relevant effective hamiltonian will be given in the sm , and the constituent quark model will be used to give the numerical predictions .",
    "finally , we make some comments in section 3 .",
    "the most important contributions to @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) stem from the effective hamiltonian which induces the pure leptonic processes @xmath24 .",
    "let us start with the short distance contributions to the latter one , which include box , @xmath25 and photon penguin diagrams .",
    "the feynman diagrams are displayed in fig.1 .",
    "the qcd corrected effective hamiltonian in the sm is @xcite : @xmath26,\\label{1}\\ ] ] with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the momentum of the lepton pair .",
    "the qcd corrected wilson coefficients @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are given by misiak @xcite .",
    "because of the lightness of the leptons @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the pure leptonic processes @xmath35 are suppressed by helicity .",
    "if a photon line is attached to any of the charged lines in fig.1 , the situation will be different : helicity suppression is overcome .",
    "when the photon is attached to internal lines , there will be a suppression factor of @xmath36 in the wilson coefficient , since the resulting operators(dimension-8 ) are two orders higher in dimensions than the usual ones(dimension-6 ) .",
    "one may expect that the additional two diagrams displayed in fig.2 ( a ) and ( b ) might also contribute to the decay @xmath37 .",
    "however , our calculation shows that the contribution of fig.2(b ) is quite small and its influence can be neglected in the numerical results .",
    "fig.2(a ) involves a singularity , since the intermediate @xmath38 quark can be on its mass shell .",
    "the influence of this singularity is an artifact of the constituent quark model employed here . if we calculate the contribution of fig .",
    "2(a ) to the differential decay rate anywhere except near the singularity we find it to be negligible ( at most a few percent ) .",
    "therefore we neglect it altogether .",
    "there are also long distance contributions to @xmath39 .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath6 decay , there are cascade processes at the hadronic level : @xmath40 these involve the on - shell @xmath41 and are similar to @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "they are estimated to be of order of @xmath14 , which is about the same order of the short distance contribution .",
    "all these long distance effects , which are shown as sharp peaks in the invariant mass spectrum of the lepton pair , will not be included in the following .    now using a simple constituent quark model ( see , for example , @xcite )",
    ", we calculate the amplitude for diagrams with photon emitted from external fermion lines .",
    "first , for diagrams with photon attached to external lepton lines , we get the amplitude proportional to : @xmath43 l.\\label{4}\\ ] ] using the decay constant definition : @xmath44 we can easily calculate the results of eqn.([4 ] ) .",
    "note that , there is no contribution from the operator @xmath45 in this circumstance , since the definition of the decay constant shows that : @xmath46    for the other two diagrams with photon emitted from the external quark lines ( @xmath47 or @xmath48 ) , the amplitude is proportional to : @xmath49 b \\left [ c_9^{eff } \\bar l \\gamma_\\mu l   + c_{10 } \\bar l \\gamma_\\mu \\gamma_5 l ) \\right]\\ ] ] @xmath50 b \\;(\\bar l \\gamma_\\mu l ) .",
    "\\label{4.1}\\ ] ] in the constituent quark model , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "then applying eqn.([dd ] ) , neglecting terms suppressed by @xmath53 , @xmath54 , we get : @xmath55 \\left[\\left(c_9^{eff}-\\frac{2c_7 m_{b_q}^2}{p^2 } \\right)\\bar l   \\gamma ^\\mu l+c_{10 } \\bar l\\gamma^\\mu \\gamma_5 l \\right],\\label{5}\\ ] ] with @xmath56 after squaring the total decay amplitude , we find that the contribution of diagrams with photon attached to the lepton lines ( eqn.([4 ] ) ) is proportional to @xmath57 , which is negligible in numerical calculations . the main contribution to @xmath58 is thus from the square of eqn.([5 ] ) . performing the phase space integration over one of the two dalitz variables , we get the differential decay width versus @xmath59 : @xmath60 we see that the differential rate is proportional to @xmath61 . using @xmath62 , @xmath63 gev , @xmath64 gev and @xmath65",
    ", the differential decay rate as a function of @xmath66 is displayed in fig.3 , which shows that the contribution from soft photons , corresponding to large @xmath66 region , is negligibly small .",
    "after integration , we also get : @xmath67 for @xmath7 meson decay , we take @xmath68 and @xmath69 gev .",
    "the decay widths are then : @xmath70 if the lifetimes are taken as @xmath71 , @xmath72 @xcite , and if @xmath73mev is used , they correspond to the branching ratios : @xmath74    note that the branching ratios we get for radiative decays are just the same order of the pure leptonic decay @xmath75 .",
    "the decay rates for pure leptonic decays are : @xmath76 using the same parameters as in the radiative decay , the numerical results are : @xmath77 so for the @xmath78 channel , the radiative decay dominates over the dileptonic one , while for the @xmath79 channel , the branching ratio of the radiative decay is a little larger than that for the pure leptonic decay .",
    "we predict the branching ratios in the sm for @xmath80 to be around @xmath1 for @xmath2 and around @xmath3 for @xmath4 , with slightly larger values for @xmath5 . with these predictions",
    ", they will hopefully be detected at lhc - b .",
    "thus provide alternative channels for measuring @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) . in lhc - b ,",
    "approximately @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) @xmath7 ( @xmath6 ) mesons are expected per year , therefore there is a good chance of observing the decays considered here .",
    "we conclude with comments on the experimental extractions of the decay constants . in the measurements of the pure leptonic decays ,",
    "processes with additional soft photons emitted ( say , photons with energy less than 50 mev ) might contribute due to the inability of the detector to separate them . from our calculation , we find that these soft photon processes are not important in the radiative dileptonic decays , see fig.3",
    ". since the efficiency of detecting photons may be low , it will be useful for experiments to have the sum of the radiative decay and the pure leptonic processes : @xmath85 the total @xmath86 branching ratios for @xmath87 and @xmath7 decay are almost the same as that of the @xmath88 case .",
