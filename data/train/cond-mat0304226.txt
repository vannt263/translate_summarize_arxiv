    "the kosterlitz - thouless(kt ) transition has attracted a steady interest since its discovery .",
    "@xcite this is both because its unusual characteristic properties and its applicability to many systems with two - dimensional ( 2d ) character , like , e.g. , superfluid / superconducting films .  @xcite the critical properties are given by kosterlitz s renormalization equations ( kre).@xcite a key characteristic feature is the discontinuous universal superfluid jump to zero at the transition .",
    "@xcite the generic model for the kt transition is the two - dimensional _ xy _ model and in this case the discontinuous jump is associated with the helicity modulus .",
    "@xcite the 2d _ xy _ model has been the subject of very many computer simulations directed at verifying or disproving the various characteristics of the kt transition as given by kre .  @xcite although the general consensus is that the 2d _ xy _ model does indeed undergo a kt transition , there have also been claims from simulations that the predictions from kre may not be entirely correct .",
    "@xcite in particular , these earlier works have been focused on the question whether or not the divergence of the correlation length ( when the transition is approached from above ) , is governed by an essential singularity , as predicted by kre , or by a conventional power - law singularity .",
    "some evidence for the latter possibility was found in refs .  .",
    "alternatively , in ref .   it was argued that the divergence is given by an essential singularity which is not entirely consistent with kre .",
    "all this reflects the difficulty of verifying the precise nature of the transition through computer simulations .",
    "@xcite    similarly , it is difficult to directly verify from simulations that there is a discontinuous jump in the helicity modulus as predicted by kre .",
    "the reason for this is illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : hel ] : simulations can only be performed on a finite systems , resulting in the helicity modulus as a continuous function without any singularity . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : hel ] the drop at the transition gets steeper and steeper as the system size is increased .",
    "however , the size dependence is shown to be rather weak . consequently , although numerical results like those presented in fig .  [ fig : hel ] for the helicity modulus are consistent with a discontinuous jump for an infinite system size , one can not on this evidence alone , exclude the possibility that the helicity modulus remains continuous in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the correctness of the discontinuous character of the jump has in practice only been verified from simulations in more indirect ways which make use of additional kre - predictions for the kt transition like e.g. that the leading size dependence of the helicity modulus at the critical temperature is logarithmic .",
    "@xcite    thus one may ask if there exists a more direct way of inferring from simulations that there is a discontinuous jump , without resorting to more indirect methods which use additional kre predictions . in this paper",
    "we show that such a more direct way does indeed exist .",
    "our approach is based on the calculation of a higher order correlation function .",
    "this correlation function appears to give an additional and somewhat unexpected characteristic feature of the kt transition .",
    "we speculate that this feature might be associated with a universal number akin to the universal value of the helicity modulus at the critical temperature .",
    "the 2d _ xy _ model on a square lattice of the size @xmath0 is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the coupling strength ( set to unity from now on ) , the sum is over nearest neighbor pairs separated by the displacement @xmath3 or @xmath4 ( we set the lattice spacing @xmath5 ) , and the phase angle @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) at the lattice point @xmath8 satisfies the periodicity @xmath9 . for generality , we have also included an externally imposed global twist across the sample , @xmath10 , defined by that the summation of the phase difference @xmath11 along the @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) direction equals @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the partition function @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 and the free energy by @xmath18 .",
    "the ground state corresponds to the configuration where all spins point in the same direction ( i.e. , all @xmath19 ) which means that the minimum of the free energy corresponds to @xmath20 . from the symmetry in the hamiltonian , all odd - order derivatives such as @xmath21 and @xmath22 vanish .",
    "accordingly , in the following we will from standard monte carlo simulations obtain the two first nonvanishing derivatives of the free energy with respect to @xmath23 at @xmath20 , i.e. , the second order modulus , usually called the helicity modulus , @xmath24 , and the 4th order modulus @xmath25 , where @xmath26 denotes the thermal average .",
    "the former ( the helicity modulus ) can be expressed as @xmath27 where @xmath28 @xmath29 and the sum is over all links in one direction .",
    "this means that @xmath30 is the energy per link and @xmath31 is the average current per link in one direction ( here taken to be the @xmath12 direction ) .",
    "note that @xmath32 by symmetry , in contrast to the current - current correlation @xmath33 which measures the current fluctuation .",
    "the fourth - order modulus can be expressed as @xmath34 + \\frac{2l^6}{t^3}\\langle s^4\\rangle\\ ] ] in the following , we will measure these two correlation functions , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , in standard mc simulations to demonstrate the existence of a discontinuous jump of the helicity modulus to zero at the phase transition .",
    "since the global minimum of the free energy @xmath37 corresponds to zero twist , it follows that @xmath38 .",
    "to lowest orders in the @xmath39 expansion we have @xmath40 this means that @xmath41 since the lowest order nonvanishing derivative of the free energy will always dominate for small enough @xmath39 .",
    "however , it also implies that the next order derivative @xmath42 likewise has to be @xmath43 at any @xmath44 where @xmath45 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "our argument is then the simple observation that @xmath46 can not go continuously to zero at the transition temperature @xmath47 if @xmath42 at the same time approaches a nonzero negative value at @xmath47 .",
    "but , since @xmath46 is indeed zero in the high - temperature phase , this means that if @xmath42 approaches a negative value at @xmath47 then the jump has to be discontinuous .",
    "the point is , as we will show below , that the conclusion that @xmath42 is nonzero and negative at @xmath47 can be convincingly drawn from standard mc simulations .",
    "our simulation of the helicity modulus for 2d _ xy _ model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hel ] up to sizes @xmath48 . the conclusions which can safely be drawn by analyzing the finite size dependence of @xmath35",
    "is that it is finite in the low temperature phase and is zero in the high temperature phase .",
    "since this is well established we will not discuss it further here . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , the difficult part from a simulation aspect is to determine _ how _ the helicity modulus approaches zero at @xmath47 in the thermodynamic limit .    .",
    "[ fig : hel4 ]    to this end we will use the stability argument given above and instead focus on the size dependence of the correlation function @xmath49 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hel4 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : hel4](a ) shows that @xmath50 vanishes in the high - temperature phase and goes to a nonzero negative value in the low temperature phase as the system size becomes larger .",
    "the interesting features is the divergent dip .",
    "this occurs in the region where the helicity modulus for finite @xmath51 goes rapidly towards zero .",
    "thus this singularity in @xmath52 can safely be associated with @xmath47 .",
    "the conclusion from fig .",
    "[ fig : hel4](a ) is that @xmath52 diverges at @xmath47 for @xmath53 , goes to zero above , and goes to a negative nonzero value below .",
    "this conclusion is further supported by the fact that the half - width of the divergent dip decreases towards zero for @xmath54 as illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : hel4](a ) .",
    "the crucial point is now what this divergence in the correlation function @xmath52 implies for @xmath42 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hel4](b ) , which gives the result for @xmath55 .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : hel4](b ) gives the depth of the dip as a function of size .",
    "as is apparent from the inset , the depth goes to a finite value in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "linear extrapolation in @xmath56 to @xmath57 gives the value @xmath58 .",
    "thus we conclude that @xmath59 is indeed negative and nonzero precisely at @xmath47 . using the stability argument in sec .",
    "[ sec : stability ] this means that the helicity modulus has to be positive and nonzero precisely at @xmath47 .",
    "however , above @xmath47 the helicity modulus is zero from which follows that the helicity modulus has to be discontinuous at @xmath47 .",
    "one may also note from fig .",
    "[ fig : hel4](b ) that the position of the minimum of the dip decreases towards lower @xmath44 with increasing @xmath51",
    ". however , the approach towards the known value of @xmath47 ( @xmath60 ) is rather slow making a precise determination of @xmath47 based on @xmath42-data less advantageous .",
    "we have shown that the discontinuous character of the jump of the helicity modulus at the transition for the 2d _ xy _ model can be established from mc simulations of the 4th order modulus given by eq.([ups_4 ] ) .",
    "it seems very likely that the singularity found here for the 4th order modulus in case of the 2d _ xy _ model is part of the general kt transition scenario .",
    "thus we suggest that it sometimes may be advantageous to study the singularity of this 4th order modulus in simulations , when trying to determine if a transition for a particular model is of kt type .",
    "it is also tempting to speculate that the finite value of @xmath61 at @xmath47 is associated with a universal number , akin to the universal value of of the helicity modulus @xmath62 .",
