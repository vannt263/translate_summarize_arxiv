    "in this work we are interested in the linear stability of solutions of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) euler equations which are steady in the appropriate frame of reference and feature compact regions with constant vorticity embedded in an otherwise potential flow .",
    "such solutions arise as inviscid limits of actual viscous flows , and therefore find numerous applications in different areas of fluid mechanics .",
    "the first linear stability analysis of such a flow is attributed to kelvin @xcite , see also @xcite , who identified the dispersion relation of neutrally - stable travelling waves with @xmath0-fold symmetry moving along the perimeter of a circular vortex .",
    "this problem was revisited by baker @xcite who used a contour dynamics approach involving integrals with singular kernels defined on the vortex boundary .",
    "the stability of a rotating ellipse , the so - called kirchhoff vortex @xcite , was analyzed in the seminal study by love @xcite .",
    "the effect of an ambient strain field was investigated by moore & saffman @xcite , whereas mitchell & rossi @xcite explored the relation between the linear instabilities and the long - term nonlinear evolution of elliptic vortices . in this context",
    "we also mention the analytical study of guo et al .",
    "@xcite where an integro - differential perturbation equation similar to ours is proposed for the case of the elliptic vortex .",
    "the linear stability of more complex vortex configurations , such as polygonal arrays of corotating vortices and translating vortex pairs , was investigated by dritschel @xcite , see also dritschel & legras @xcite . a noteworthy feature of their approach is that they also used a _ continuous _ perturbation equation independent of a particular discretization employed to obtain the equilibrium solution .",
    "problems related to the stability of polygonal vortex arrays were also studied by dhanak @xcite .",
    "the linear stability of the so - called v - states @xcite , corotating vortex patches and infinite periodic arrays of vortices was investigated in detail by kamm @xcite , see as well @xcite .",
    "this approach was based on the representation of the solution in terms of the schwarz function , and required discretization and numerical differentiation in order to obtain the perturbation equation .",
    "a discrete form of the perturbation equation was also used by elcrat et al .",
    "@xcite in their investigation of the linear stability of vortices in a symmetric equilibrium with a circular cylinder and a free stream at infinity .",
    "there have also been a number of analytical investigations concerning the stability , both in the linear and nonlinear setting , of flows obtained as perturbations of the rankine vortex @xcite .",
    "another family of approaches is based on variational energy arguments going back to kelvin .",
    "they were initially investigated in @xcite , and were more recently pursued by luzzatto - fegiz & williamson @xcite .",
    "they rely on global properties of the excess energy vs.  velocity impulse diagrams and provide partial information about the linear stability properties without the need to actually perform a full linear stability analysis .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there is no complete derivation and validation of the stability equations for two - dimensional ( 2d ) vortex patches available in the literature .",
    "the main goal of this paper is thus to fill this gap by proposing a systematic approach to the study of the linear stability of vortices which is quite general in the sense that it is based on the continuous , rather than discrete , formulation of the governing equations and a rigorous treatment of boundary deformations .",
    "this aspect , namely , that linearization of differential and integral expressions with respect to perturbations of the shape of the domain requires special treatment with methods other than the traditional calculus of variations does not seem to have received much attention in the vortex dynamics literature . therefore , the proposed approach may serve as a template for studying more complicated problems such as the stability of vortex equilibria in three dimensions ( 3d ) . recognizing the euler equation describing finite - area vortices as a _ free - boundary _ problem , we apply methods of the shape - differential calculus to derive a perturbation equation in the form of an integro - differential equation defined on the vortex boundary . we emphasize that , in contrast to @xcite , numerical differentiation is not required at any stage of the derivation , but only in the evaluation of the coefficients of the perturbation equation . in this sense ,",
    "the formulation we propose is a contour - dynamics analogue of the orr - sommerfeld equation used to study the stability of viscous parallel flows @xcite . in this work",
    "we also demonstrate using analytical calculations how one can reproduce the dispersion relations obtained by kelvin in the stability analysis of the rankine vortex @xcite and by love in the stability analysis of the elliptic vortex @xcite from our general perturbation equation .",
    "generalization of our approach to the stability analysis of more complicated vortex flows , including 3d axisymmetric configurations , is deferred to future research .",
    "we are interested in developing a general approach to analyzing the linear stability of 2d steady - state solutions of the euler equation which is usually written in the following form @xcite    [ eq : euler ] @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the streamfunction , @xmath3 is the flow domain , whereas @xmath4 represents the boundary condition for the streamfunction .",
    "the function @xmath5 is a priori undetermined and any choice of @xmath6 will yield a steady solution of the 2d euler equation .",
    "one choice of the function @xmath6 , motivated by the flow models arising from the prandtl - batchelor theory @xcite , is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the heaviside function , whereas @xmath9 are , respectively , the vorticity inside the vortex and the value of the streamfunction at its boundary .",
    "the profile given in corresponds to finite - area vortices with constant vorticity @xmath10 embedded in an otherwise potential flow .",
    "this formulation can be made more general by including in a term proportional to dirac delta function representing a vortex sheet on the vortex boundary @xcite , but we do not consider this in the present study .",
    "a salient feature of problem  is that the shape of the vortex region , which we will denote @xmath11 , is a priori unknown and therefore must be determined as a part of the solution to the problem .",
    "system  is thus a _ free - boundary _ problem , and in order to emphasize this fact which will play a central role in our analysis , we rewrite it in the following form which makes the free - boundary property more evident    [ eq : eulerfb ] @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the restrictions of the streamfunction @xmath2 to , respectively , the rotational and irrotational part of the flow domain and @xmath15 is the unit vector normal to the vortex boundary ( `` @xmath16 '' means `` equal to by definition '' )",
    ". solutions of system depend on two parameters @xmath10 and @xmath17 or , equivalently , the vortex area @xmath18 and its circulation @xmath19 .",
    "there is evidence that by continuing the solutions of corresponding to different flow configurations such that @xmath20 and @xmath21 one can obtain the corresponding point - vortex equilibria @xcite . in agreement with earlier studies",
    "@xcite , we will assume in this investigation that both parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 are fixed , so that the perturbations will be allowed to modify the shape of the vortex region @xmath11 leaving its area and circulation unchanged .",
    "in other words , no vorticity is created by the perturbations .",
    "derivation of the jacobian , needed for the linear stability analysis of a given problem , requires differentiation of the governing equation with respect to the state variables . in the present problem , since governing system is of the free - boundary type , this is a rather delicate issue , because the shape of the vortex @xmath11 can be regarded as a `` state variable '' .",
    "a proper way to deal with this problem is therefore to use the _ shape - differential calculus _",
    "@xcite which is a suite of mathematical techniques for differentiation of various objects such as differential equations , integrals , etc . , defined on variable domains .",
    "application of the shape - differentiation methods makes it possible to derive a continuous perturbation equation for vortices with very general shapes in a rigorous and systematic manner which is the main contribution of this work .",
    "a key element is a proper linearization of the contour dynamics equations with respect to arbitrary boundary perturbations . as regards derivations of the different shape - differentiation identities we use in this study ,",
    "the reader is referred to monographs @xcite , and to the review paper @xcite for a survey of applications of the shape calculus to different problems in computational fluid dynamics .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in the next section we derive a general form of the perturbation equation , in sections [ sec : circular ] and [ sec : elliptic ] we use this perturbation equation to obtain the dispersion relations for the circular and elliptic vortices , comments about an accurate numerical technique for the solution of the perturbation equation are presented in section [ sec : numer ] together with some computational results , whereas conclusions are deferred to section [ sec : final ] .",
    "some technical results are collected in appendix .",
    "in this section we develop a systematic approach to derivation of the perturbation equation characterizing the stability of steady vortex configurations . for brevity of notation , in what follows",
    "we will use the complex number representation of vector quantities .",
    "this is indicated by using ordinary letters for vector quantities ( e.g. , @xmath24 for @xmath25 and similarly for other vector quantities ) .",
    "juxtaposition ( i.e. , @xmath26 for some @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) indicates complex multiplication of @xmath27 and @xmath29 .",
    "however , when we need equations written in the vector form , as we will in referencing results from shape calculus , we will denote vector quantities in bold face and inner products of vectors using the usual dot notation .",
    "thus , for @xmath30 vectors and @xmath31 the corresponding complex numbers , we have the following identity @xmath32 $ ] , where the overbar denotes complex conjugation . to fix attention , we will focus on the simplest , yet generic , case of a single vortex region @xmath11 in equilibrium with an external velocity field @xmath33 which may represent a free stream",
    ", the influence of other vortices , or may result from transformation of the problem to a moving ( i.e. , translating or rotating ) coordinate system in which a relative equilibrium exists .",
    "we will consider a point @xmath34 on the vortex boundary @xmath35 , see figure [ fig : patch ] , which is assumed to have counterclockwise orientation .",
    "using techniques of vortex dynamics @xcite , the velocity of a particle located at the point @xmath36 can be expressed in the fixed frame of reference as follows @xmath37 where the integral on the right - hand side ( rhs ) has a removable singularity ( @xmath38 is a complex integration variable ) .",
    "starting from relation , one can pursue our objective with one of the two alternative approaches , namely ( figure [ fig : patch ] ) :    * _ lagrangian _ approach in which one follows the trajectory of a fluid particle on the vortex boundary ; we note that displacement of a material particle in general also involves a component tangential to the vortex boundary which does not lead to deformations of the contour @xcite , * _ geometric _ approach in which one considers displacements of the points on the boundary in the direction normal to the boundary only @xcite .",
    "since the lagrangian approach involves additional ( tangential ) degrees of freedom , the stability results obtained with the geometric approach represent a subset of the results obtained with the lagrangian approach .",
    "while both approaches can be pursued using methods of shape - differentiation , in this work we will focus on the geometric approach as it leads to somewhat simpler calculations .",
    "and ( dashed line ) its perturbation . the points @xmath39 and @xmath40 represent the images of the point @xmath36 under , respectively , the lagrangian and `` geometric '' displacement.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    as a first step , we transform relation to a suitable moving ( i.e. , rotating or translating ) coordinate system , characterized by the rigid - body velocity @xmath41 , in which a relative equilibrium is attained . denoting @xmath42 the position of the point @xmath43 in this moving coordinate system , the left - hand side ( lhs ) of becomes @xmath44 , so that relation can rewritten as @xmath45 in equation and hereafter we use both @xmath43 and @xmath42 , and note that , since @xmath46 , either coordinate can be used on the rhs of to derive the perturbation equation .",
    "let @xmath47 be the unit vector normal to the boundary @xmath35 and pointing outside of @xmath11 .",
