    "an intermediate polar tv columbae was first discovered as a hard x - ray source 2a 0526 - 328 by @xcite .",
    "the subsequent photometries and spectroscopies detected five periods of 32 min , 5.2 hr , 5.5 hr , 6.3 hr and @xmath34 day , which corresponding to the spin modulation in x - ray @xcite , the beat period between 5.5 hr and 4 day @xcite , the binary orbital period @xcite , the permanent positive superhump period @xcite and the nodal precession of the accretion disc period @xcite , respectively .",
    "no until @xcite was the eclipse in tv columbae reported . except for the 32 min detected in x - ray observation",
    ", the other four periods presented in optical regime give rise to the high variabilities in eclipse light curves of tv columbae @xcite .",
    "although the eclipse light curves of tv columbae show cycle - to - cycle variations , a shallow eclipse of part of the accretion disc is established .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have pointed out that the eclipse of tv columbae in a certain case ( maybe outburst ) is clearly modulated by a broader quasi - sinusoidal modulation .",
    "moreover , @xcite found a peculiar phenomenon in tv columbae that its eclipse can totally disappear in the light curve observed in january 1st , 1986 .    since plenty of investigators focused on the variations of 5.2 hr and 4 day periods , few analyses in its orbital period were made in the past .",
    "however , many 5.2 hr period analyses indicate that this period is not stable and can change non - monotonically with time @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is difficult to detect the variations of 4-d modulation because of the short observation time in most case . thus , the stable and distinct photometric period of 5.5 hr in tv columbae can provide a best opportunity to probe the possible evolutional state and inner interaction between two components .",
    "the first orbital period analysis @xcite suggested that the quadratic term in the o - c diagram was suspected .",
    "then @xcite and @xcite never detected the changes in its orbital period .",
    "a time span of about 17 years , from the last eclipse timing @xcite to now , implies that an updated and available orbital period analysis is expected to detect the possible variations in orbital period of tv columbae .    in this paper ,",
    "the two light curves near the mid - eclipse by ccd photometries and two new eclipse timings of tv columbae with high precision are presented in sect .",
    "2 . then sect . 3 deals with the details of the updated o - c analysis in the orbital period of 5.5 hr .",
    "finally , the probable discussions for the observed orbital period changes are made in sect .",
    "4 and our principal conclusions in sect .",
    "two new times of light minimum are obtained from our ccd photometric observations with the versarray 1300b ccd camera attached to the 2.15-m jorge sahade telescope at complejo astronomico el leoncito ( casleo ) , san juan , argentina . both photometries of tv columbae in v - filter",
    "were carried out on november 18 and 20 , 2009 .",
    "two nearby stars which have the similar brightness in the same viewing field of telescope are chosen as the comparison star and the check star , respectively .",
    "all images were reduced by using phot ( measure magnitudes for a list of stars ) of the aperture photometry package of iraf .",
    "two partial eclipse light curves shown in fig .",
    "1 indicate obviously night - to - night variations , which present different eclipse depth ( @xmath4 ) at the different cycle .",
    "a nearly flat - toped maximum with a phase range @xmath5 is detected in the eclipse light curve observed in november 18 , 2009 , which is never found in the previous photometries @xcite .",
    "moreover , we obtained a distinct eclipse profile with a long egress in the other observation in november 20 , 2009 .",
    "the orbital light curves of tv columbae in outburst are similar as the sinusoidal curves ( see the photometries in 1987 , 1988 and 1991 outbursts ) , which are totally different with those observed in quiescence . thus , considering the extreme changes in the eclipse profiles at different epochs , the eclipse timings with high precision are important for the investigation of variations in orbital period of tv columbae .",
    "two accurate times of mid - eclipse were derived by using a parabolic fitting method to the very deepest part of the eclipse . including the previous 43 times of light minimum for tv columbae @xcite , we listed all 45 available times of light minimum covering near 30 yr in table 1 .",
    "values of tv columbae are calculated by eq .",
    "the best fit linear and sinusoidal curves are plotted by dash line and solid line , respectively .",
    "the two @xmath6 values at the same cycles as our data points , which are predicted by the quadratic ephemeris @xcite denoted by the dotted line , are plotted by the solid upper triangles .",
    "the open circles represent the data points from @xcite , the filled diamonds and circles the two data points we obtained and the data from the other papers , respectively . after removing the linear element from the @xmath6 diagram and the data from @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath7 values shown in the middle panel suggest a significant cyclical period change .",
    "the residuals and their linear fitted solid line are presented in the bottom panel .",
    "the ordinates of all three panels are in day units.,width=340 ]    .,width=340 ]     are plotted in the left and right panels , respectively.,width=340 ]",
    "the data from aavso an international database ( http://www.aavso.org/data/download/ ) suggest that tv columbae is not in outburst during our observations , and from fig .",
    "1 it can not be seen that a dip around orbital phase @xmath8 , which is different from the light curves in 1987 i and 1988 obtained by @xcite .",
    "a recent orbital ephemeris @xcite , @xmath9 is used to check whether the updated two eclipse timings obey the regular 5.5 hr orbital modulation . the two cycles 35007.226 and 35015.214 corresponding to the observed mid - eclipse times hjd 2455153.843579(76 ) and hjd 2455155.669797(71 ) , respectively , are calculated , which means that both observed orbital eclipse minima are about @xmath10 in phase later than the predicted times .",
    "this large discrepancy implies that tv columbae should seriously expand its orbit in an extreme short timescale ( @xmath11 ) , which is obviously not supported by observations .",
    "this means that either the two derived eclipse timings or the orbital ephemeris eq .",
    "1 are wrong .",
    "however , the orbital ephemeris derived by @xcite , @xmath12 can accurately predict the mid - eclipse times are hjd 2455153.846142 and hjd 2455155.674945 , which corresponds to the o - c values @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . therefore , although both light curves we obtained are not complete and the multi - periodic modulations badly affect the profiles of orbital light curves , we can ensure that the derived mid - eclipse times are correct . in order to find the error in eq . 1",
    ", we carefully compared both ephemerides , and then found that the small discrepancy @xmath15 in the average orbital period between eq . 1 and eq .",
    "2 is accumulated to @xmath16 ( i.e. @xmath17 in phase ) over 30 years .",
    "moreover , the error in average orbital period may explain the deviations and phase shifts of eclipse times in @xcite .",
    "the o - c values of 45 eclipse timings for tv columbae listed in column 6 of table 1 are calculated by using eq .",
    "2 . the new o - c diagram shown in fig . 2 suggests a possible cyclical variation instead of the secular decrease derived by @xcite , because hellier s quadratic ephemeris predicted the o - c values at the same cycles as our data are about @xmath18 shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "2 , which are clearly distinct with our observations . therefore , we attempted to use a linear - plus - sinusoidal ephemeris to fit the o - c values .",
    "since the large scatters from @xmath19 cycles to @xmath20 cycles obviously exceed the errors of the mid - eclipse times , the probable weights should be reconsidered instead of those calculated from the uncertainties of the mid - eclipse times .",
    "the incorrect orbital ephemeris and the possible deviations in eclipse times derived by @xcite imply that the weights of their data should be lower than the others .",
    "therefore , a least - square solution for the o - c values of tv columbae leads to @xmath21 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although the early data present large scatters , all the high - precision data except for the two data points with large error bars @xmath22 @xcite well support a possible cyclical variation trend in o - c diagram after removing the data from @xcite and the linear element , which is clearly shown in the middle panel of fig .",
    "moreover , the fitting @xmath23 suggests that a cyclical period variation with a period of @xmath24 is significant .",
    "the radial velocity measurements @xcite and the spectroscopic analyses @xcite never obtained the consistent system parameters of tv columbae . according to the classification of tv columbae as a permanent superhump system @xcite",
    ", tv columbae may be an extreme system with a mass ratio @xmath25 , which is in contradiction with that calculated by the relation between the orbital period and the secondary mass in cvs @xcite .",
    "moreover , assuming that the white dwarf in tv columbae has a typical mass of @xmath26 , the secondary mass can be estimated to be @xmath27 , which may be agree with the estimated spectra type of the secondary late k or early m type @xcite .",
    "thus , we adopted a combined mass of @xmath28 for the eclipsing pair of tv columbae .",
    "considering that the eclipse of the intermediate polar tv columbae may be of a partial accretion disc caused by the magnetic of the white dwarf , the changes in the partial disc may produce the changes in the o - c diagram shown in fig .",
    "moreover , a cyclical period variation can be interpreted by two plausible mechanisms , which are applegate s mechanism @xcite and light travel - time effect . as for the former",
    ", a careful calculation for the variation of quadrupole momentum suggests that @xmath29 . considering the secondary in tv columbae",
    "is known little , the energies required to cause the observed o - c oscillation corresponding to different assumed shell masses are calculated .",
    "the lowest required energy @xmath30 at @xmath31 , is larger than the total radiant energy of a m0 type star over a complete variation period @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , a solar - type magnetic cycle may have difficulty explaining the observed cyclical period variation in tv columbae as the previous analysis for other cvs @xcite .",
    "another plausible mechanism for explaining the cyclical period variation in o - c diagram is the light travel - time effect caused by a perturbations from a tertiary component .",
    "if the two data points at cycles -3193 and 26 with large error bars can be omitted , then the cyclical period changes shown in the middle panel of fig .",
    "2 would well support an excellent sinusoidal fit . by using the amplitude of sinusoidal curve and the third kepler law , the projected distance @xmath34 from binary to the mass center of the triple system and the mass function of the third component @xmath35",
    "can be calculated to be @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively . according to the both relationships described in fig .",
    "4 , the mass of the third star in tv columbae is very close to the mass lower limit of a star with stable hydrogen burning ( @xmath2 ) when the inclination of the third star is higher enough . in addition",
    ", the distance from the third body to the mass center of system is @xmath38 , which is over two orders of magnitude larger than the separation of binary .",
    "thus , this third star can survive the previous common envelope evolution of the parent binary .",
    "two new light curves near mid - eclipse with obviously night - to - night variations are obtained . moreover , a near flat - top shape maximum in the light curve observed in november 18 , 2009 with a phase range @xmath5 is first detected . both updated eclipse timings with high precision for intermediate polar tv columbae we observed , which indicate a phase shift of @xmath17 by using eq .",
    "1 , can be accurately predicted by eq .",
    "a compare between the two orbital ephemerides indicates that the average orbital period derived by @xcite is incorrect and the errors are accumulated to @xmath16 ( i.e. @xmath17 in phase ) over the 30 years .",
    "this means the augusteijn s orbital ephemeris is not appropriate for calculating the orbital phase of tv columbae .",
    "based on the probable linear ephemeris , a detailed orbital period analysis suggests a significant cyclical period variation with a period of @xmath24 in its o - c diagram , which can not be explained by applegate s mechanism .",
    "accordingly , a light travel - time effect is applied to interpret the cyclical period change .",
    "the third body in tv columbae may be a low mass dwarf as long as the orbital inclination of tertiary component high enough . since tv columbae is a complex system and the explanations for its updated o - c diagram",
    "is only based on the two new mid - eclipse timings , the cyclical period change shown in fig .",
    "2 should be checked by the more data in the future .",
    "although the system parameters of tv columbae are ambiguous , which means that any conclusive result can not be obtained , the discussions based on some plausible assumptions are still important to the further understanding for tv columbae . therefore , the more observations including ccd photometries with a longer base line and spectroscopies with high resolution are needed to probe such multi - periodic system .",
