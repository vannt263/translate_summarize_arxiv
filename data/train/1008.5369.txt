    "tidal breakup of binary stars by the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) at the galactic center ( gc ) has been invoked to explain a number of otherwise puzzling discoveries , including the hypervelocity stars ( hvss ) that are observed in the halo of the milky way @xcite , and the s - stars , apparently young , main - sequence stars in tight eccentric orbits around the smbh @xcite .",
    "as first pointed out by j. hills , close passage of a binary star near a smbh can result in an exchange interaction , such that one component of the binary is ejected with greater than escape velocity while the other star is scattered onto a tightly - bound orbit @xcite .",
    "the predictions of this model are broadly consistent with the observed properties of both the hvss @xcite and the s - stars @xcite .",
    "the origin of the binary progenitors of the hvss is not clear .",
    "one possibility is that the binaries originated at distances of a few parsecs from the gc and were subsequently scattered inward by `` massive - perturbers '' @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "most of the binaries will lie on either unbound or weakly - bound orbits with respect to the smbh , and they will encounter it only once before being scattered onto different orbits . alternatively , the binaries may form closer to the smbh , perhaps in the young ( or an older ) stellar disk that is observed between @xmath3 pc and @xmath4 pc from the smbh @xcite . also , @xcite suggested that binaries could be left near the gc through a triple disruption by the smbh . in these latter cases ,",
    "the binaries would be bound to the smbh and would encounter it many times before being disrupted .",
    "if the finite sizes of stars are taken into account , a number of outcomes are possible in addition to simple binary disruption .",
    "the two stars can collide , resulting in a merger if the relative velocity is less than stellar escape velocities @xcite . since the radius of tidal disruption of single stars by the smbh is comparable to the binary disruption radius , stars can also be tidally disrupted by the smbh , either before or after their close interaction with each other .",
    "in paper i @xcite we presented the results of a large number of @xmath5-body integrations of point - mass binary stars on eccentric orbits around the gc smbh . in many cases ,",
    "the trajectories of the two stars were found to imply a physical collision , assuming that the unperturbed stars had radii similar to those of normal main - sequence stars of the same mass .",
    "the probability of physical encounters was found to increase significantly if the binaries were allowed to complete many orbits about the smbh . in some cases , one or both stars also passed close enough to the smbh that gravitational tides would be expected to significantly affect their internal structure .    in this paper , we use smoothed - particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations to study the binaries from paper i that approached closely enough to physically interact",
    ". the @xmath5-body simulations of paper i were first used to identify initial conditions that resulted in close interactions between the two stars .",
    "the point - mass stars were then realized as macroscopic , fluid - dynamical models and integrated forward in the gravitational field of the smbh using an sph algorithm . as in paper",
    "i , we followed the trajectories for multiple orbits around the smbh , allowing us , for the first time , to investigate the consequences of repeated tidal interactions with the smbh .    in  2",
    "we briefly discuss time scales for binary disruption at the gc .",
    "our initial conditions and numerical methods are described in  3 and the results in  4 .",
    "some observable consequences are presented in  5 .",
    " 6 sums up .",
    "in a dense environment , binaries may evaporate due to dynamical interactions with field stars if @xmath6 with @xmath7 the internal orbital energy of the binary , @xmath8 the binary mass , and @xmath9 the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of the stellar background . in principle , because most of the binaries at the gc are expected to be `` soft '' , @xmath10 , and because the binary evaporation time @xmath11 is a function of the distance from the smbh , the variation of @xmath11 with galactocentric radius can be used to constrain the origin of the hvss @xcite .",
    "if the evaporation time at some radius is shorter than the lifetime of a typical main - sequence star , the stellar population in this region would be dominated by isolated ( i.e. single ) stars .",
    "here we show that the survival time of binaries at galactocentric distances @xmath12pc is likely to be comparable to the typical main - sequence lifetimes of most stars in this region .",

    "the figure also shows that , at any radius , for @xmath54 , this time is larger than the typical lifetime of the the s - stars .",
    "therefore , it can not be excluded that the s - stars were initially part of binary systems originating at galactocentric distances of few tens of milliparsecs .",
    "we finally note that , in the context of this paper , it might be more appropriate to compare @xmath11 with the time scale required to drive the eccentricities of the stars away from their initial values to produce quasi - radial orbits . at the gc",
    "this time can be of the order of few myr @xcite , which is much shorter than the typical evaporation time scale of binaries with @xmath55 .",
    "in paper i we used the high - accuracy numerical integrator archain @xcite to study the dynamics of main - sequence binary stars on highly elliptical orbits whose periapsides lay close to the smbh .",
    "we determined the final orbital properties of both ejected and bound stars .",
    "initial conditions consisted of equal - mass binaries on circular relative orbits with random orientations , initial separations @xmath30 in the range @xmath56 - @xmath57 , and individual stellar masses @xmath29 of @xmath58 .",
    "the binaries were given a tangential initial velocity in the range @xmath59 km s@xmath60 - @xmath61 km s@xmath60 and initial distances of @xmath62 pc from the smbh .",
    "using the mass - radius relation @xmath63 @xcite , we could assign a physical dimension to the particles and investigate the probability of stellar collisions and mergers . in detail , we defined the minimum impact parameter for a collision as 2@xmath64 , and the two stars were assumed to coalesce when their relative velocity upon collision was lower than the escape velocity from their surface .",
    "the binary separations adopted in this work were close to the extremes of the interval within which hvss can be produced : small semimajor - axes , @xmath65 , result in contact binaries , while for @xmath66 few stars would be ejected with velocities sufficient to escape the galaxy @xcite .    in order to treat also the case of unequal - mass binaries , we extended the work of paper i to include an additional set of @xmath67 integrations of binaries with component masses @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "initial conditions and results of these new runs are summarized in appendix a. in the following , for the case of unequal mass binaries , we distinguish between the primary and secondary stars quantities using the subscripts @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively .    the orbital initial conditions that we adopt in the sph simulations correspond to binaries that enter well within their tidal disruption radius @xmath72 , approximated by the expression @xcite : @xmath73 with @xmath74 the total mass of the binary .",
    "therefore , the binaries in all of our simulations are strongly perturbed at the first periapse passage .",
    "moreover , we focus on cases where the tidal perturbations from the smbh on the single stars are expected to be significant .",
    "this corresponds to binaries with periapsides that lie close to the tidal disruption radius of a single star , or @xmath75    we selected three types of initial condition that can be classified according to the final outcome of the sph simulations .",

    "if the relative velocity at collision is sufficiently high , the stars can survive the interaction and avoid a merger . soon after the collision , one star can be ejected at high velocity .",
    "_ stellar merger_. if the two stars collide with a relative velocity at impact smaller than approximately the escape velocity from their surfaces , coalescence occurs , resulting in the formation of a new , more massive star .",
    "the merger remnant will remain bound to the smbh unless extreme mass loss occurs during coalescence .",

    "( clean ) ejection of a hvs_. the tidal breakup of the binary by the smbh results in the ejection of a star at very high velocity .",
    "the former companion of the ejected star loses energy in the process and is deposited onto a tight orbit around the smbh . here",
    ", `` clean '' means that the member stars of the binary do not collide with each other during the process of ejection .    for the sake of simplicity , in all the sph simulations we chose the initial apoapsis of the external binary orbit to be @xmath77 @xmath78 pc ( except for case h8 which has @xmath79 ;",
    "see table 1 ) .",
    "however , starting the sph simulations from this distance would greatly increase the required computational time .",
    "the stars were therefore initially placed at a point of the orbit corresponding to a much smaller distance from the smbh : @xmath80 .",
    "this choice for @xmath81 was motivated by the fact that at these distances , the tidal forces from the smbh are still too weak to significantly influence the internal structure of the stars .",

    "these oscillations are damped by the drag force , which does negative work on the system and decreases the total energy @xmath7 toward that of a minimum energy equilibrium state . at a time of 1.84 days ( @xmath105 )",

    "we conclude that thermal adjustment over an orbital period is small and often completely negligible , and we therefore do not attempt to model the thermal relaxation here .",
    "although the orbital period is small compared to the thermal timescale , it is large compared to the hydrodynamical timescale , which is about an hour . following the full hydrodynamics of a multiple orbit encounter would therefore not be practical .",
    "what we do instead is wait for the star(s ) to move sufficiently far away from the black hole and then advance any bound star around most of its kepler two body orbit .",

    "<S> stars that are initially too small to be tidally disrupted by the smbh can be puffed up by close encounters or collisions , with the result that tidal stripping occurs in subsequent periapse passages . in these cases , </S>",
    "<S> mass loss occurs episodically , sometimes for hundreds of orbits before the star is completely disrupted . </S>",
    "<S> repeated tidal flares , of either increasing or decreasing intensity , are a predicted consequence . in collisions involving a low - mass and a high - mass star , the merger product acquires a high core hydrogen abundance from the smaller star , effectively resetting the nuclear evolution `` clock '' to a younger age . </S>",
    "<S> elements like li , be and b that can exist only in the outermost envelope of a star are severely depleted due to envelope ejection during collisions and due to tidal forces from the smbh . </S>",
    "<S> tidal spin - up can occur due to either a collision or tidal torque by the smbh at periapsis . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the absence of collisions , tidal spin - up of stars is only important in a narrow range of periapse distances , @xmath1 with @xmath2 the tidal disruption radius . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of these results for the formation of the s - stars and the hypervelocity stars . </S>"
