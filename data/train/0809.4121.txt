    "the purpose of the present paper is an in - depth discussion of the operational physical meanings of the symbols in the galilean equation of motion of a physical object : @xmath0 relating space intervals , @xmath1 , time intervals , @xmath2 , and velocity , @xmath3 . the general case , for small values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is time - dependent , as well as uniform motion where @xmath4 will be considered .",
    "the specific question that is addressed is the attribution of the symbols @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 to one or more discrete physical objects a , b , ... .",
    "the symbol c is used to denote a clock , which , as discussed below , is the class of self - age - recording objects .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "the following two sections discuss the definitions of physical time intervals and space intervals respectively , and how they may be measured . in section 4",
    "the different concepts of frame velocity and relative velocity are defined .",
    "section 5 considers the initial configuration of the ` twin paradox ' thought experiment , and shows by application of the principle of sufficient reason ( or alternatively , by _ reductio ad absurdum _ ) the invariance of a length interval measured in two different inertial frames . after recalling the important concepts of ` primary ' and ` reciprocal ' space - time experiments and ` base ' and ` travelling ' frames , as introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite , section 6 analyses the different time dilatation effects in primary and reciprocal experiments .",
    "the formulae obtained demonstrate the spurious nature of the ` relativity of simultaneity ' effect of standard special relativity theory ( ssrt ) . in section 7 ,",
    "transformation formulae , between two inertial frames , of the relative velocity of two objects are obtained . in the concluding section 8",
    ", the conclusions of the paper are summarised in seven laws of space - time physics , five of which are not respected by the predictions of ssrt .",
    "the crucial point to be noticed here is that , in general , a time interval ( unlike a space interval ) is _ an attribute of a single physical object_. this concept is a commonsense one familiar in the guise of the age of any living creature or plant , which is the time interval between the present and the birth date of any animal or the germination date of any plant .    in order to make quantitative physical statements concerning age or time intervals ,",
    "it is necessary to introduce the concept of a clock , which is defined as _ a physical object that records an interval of its own age_. in order to do this the object must furnish , at any instant , 1 , a number @xmath5 , conventionally termed the _ epoch _ of the instant .",
    "the time interval between instants 1 and 2 , is then defined as the difference of the epochs of 1 and 2 : @xmath6 a good example of a self - age - recording object is a radioactive clock , as suggested by langevin  @xcite .",
    "this is a ponderable object ( a radioactive ` source ' ) that is doped at epoch @xmath7 with @xmath8 atoms of a radioactive substance of known mean decay time @xmath9 . in virtue of the radioactive decay law ,",
    "the age , @xmath10 , of the source at epoch @xmath5 when @xmath11 atoms remain undecayed is : @xmath12 as pointed out by langevin , a practical way to measure @xmath10 ( since it is evidently not possible to count @xmath11 , even if the value of @xmath8 is experimentally controllable by chemical means ) is to place the source in the same detector at the different epochs @xmath7 and @xmath5 and measure the corresponding activities @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( the numbers of disintegrations per unit of time recorded ) .",
    "the age of the source is then given by the relation @xmath15 evidently , because of the statistical nature of the decay process , the age determined by ( 2.3 ) is subject to a statistical uncertainty that depends on the value of @xmath8 and the efficiency of the detector .",
    "the ` true ' value , still , however , dependent of the experimental uncertainty in @xmath9 , is given by ( 2.2 ) or ( 2.3 ) in the limit @xmath16 .",
    "consideration of such radioactive clocks makes quite transparent the absurdity of certain predictions of ssrt  @xcite .",
    "more conventional clocks are based on periodic physical processes such as the orbital period of a planet , the oscillation period of a pendulum , balance wheel or quartz crystal , or the frequency , @xmath17 , associated via the planck - einstein relation @xmath18 with the energy of a photon @xmath19 emitted in a transition between two well - defined atomic energy levels .",
    "there is therefore an irreducible connection between the concept of a physical time interval and the time dependence or frequency ( exponential decay law , repeated periodic motion , or the proportionality of the energy and frequency of photons in quantum mechanics ) of definite physical processes .",
    "this means that there is no conceptual ambiguity in the operational definition of a physical time interval .",
    "although time , as specified by the epoch number @xmath20 of a clock c , is a fundamental attribute of c , it can be extended to every member of an array of clocks c@xmath21,c@xmath22 , .. which are at rest relative to each other , by introducing the further concepts of a _ reference frame _ f , and _ frame time _ @xmath23 .",
    "the frame f contains a system of spatial coordinates that specifies the relative spatial positions of c@xmath21,c@xmath22 , .. , and is the the common proper frame of any of the clocks , which may be in arbitary ( uniform or accelerated ) motion relative to an inertial observer .",
    "if , at any instant in the frame f , the epochs recorded by c@xmath21,c@xmath22 , .. are the same : @xmath24 the array of clocks is said to be _",
    "synchronised_. in the case that f is an inertial frame , the clocks may be mutually synchronised using einstein s well known light - signal procedure  @xcite that relies on the assumption of the isotropy of the speed of light .",
    "more general synchronisation procedures , not using light signals in free space , and applicable also to accelerated frames , are described in ref .",
    "@xcite .    of great importance for",
    "the following discussion is the concept of a _ corresponding epoch _ in two different reference frames f and f. this is defined as follows :    _ a corresponding epoch of two frames _ f _ and _ f _ in relative motion is one for which one or more objects at rest in f are seen to be spatially contiguous with one or more objects in at rest in f by observers in both frames _ .    in the notation for space intervals to be introduced in the following section , if @xmath25 then @xmath23 and @xmath26 are _ corresponding epochs_. if it happens that @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( 2.5 ) then _ clocks in the frames _ f _ and _ f _ are said to be synchronised_. in the case that f and f are inertial frames s and s and a and aare placed at the origins of spatial coordinates in s and s respectively , the condition ( 2.5 ) is identical to einstein s definition of local clock synchronisation between two inertial frames  @xcite .",
    "( 2.5 ) also corresponds to the ` system external ' synchronisation of clocks in different reference frames of mansouri and sexl  @xcite .",
    "in the following , only one - dimensional spatial separations and motion are considered .",
    "because of the assumed isotropy of three - dimensional space no loss of generality is occasioned for the problems considered in the present paper .",
    "in contrast to a time interval , a spatial interval is _ an attribute of two distinct physical objects_. it follows from this that a spatial interval at a given epoch @xmath23 in a frame f requires two labels a and b corresponding to the related physical objects in its definition : @xmath28 , where the spatial coordinate @xmath29 is defined in the frame f , in contrast to a time interval which requires only one label to specify it : @xmath30 , for a particular object , a , or @xmath23 for a particular frame , f. it is this difference of the attribution of temporal and spatial intervals to physical objects that breaks the mathematical space - time exchange symmetry  @xcite of the lorentz transformation equations according to @xmath31 , the space - time lorentz transformation equations are written as @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "this pair of equations is invariant under exchange of space - time coordinates : @xmath34 , @xmath35 . ] in their application to actual physical problems involving the description of synchronised clocks .    for a particular spatial coordinate , @xmath29 , in the frame f , the definition of the spatial separation of a and b is @xmath36",
    "the interval @xmath37 is invariant with respect to different choices of coordinate origin , equivalent to the coordinate transformation : @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is an arbitary constant .",
    "the measured spatial separation of two objects in arbitary motion in a reference frame f is defined as follows :    _ if two objects _",
    "_ b _ in arbitary motion in a reference frame _ f _ are spatially contiguous with the objects _ a _ and _ b _ at rest in _",
    "f _ at epoch _ @xmath23 , _ the spatial separation of _ a _ and _ b _ at this epoch is the same as that of _ a _ and _ b.    this is just a statement of the methodology of ` ruler measurement ' of the separation of two objects at a given epoch , as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "the expression ` spatially contiguous ' in the above definition is equivalent , in the present context , to ` have the same @xmath29-coordinate ' . as must be the case for non - colliding physical objects of non - vanishing lateral dimensions ,",
    "the @xmath40 and/or @xmath41 coordinates of the objects may be different .",
    "the _ frame velocity _ , @xmath43 is an attribute of a single physical object , a , and depends on the frame of reference , f , in which it is defined .",
    "if the frame f is understood in the symbol @xmath3 ( so that , for example , the frame velocity in the frame f is denoted by @xmath44 ) @xmath43 depends only on the label a @xmath45 .",
    "other objects b,c , ... at rest in the proper frame f of a , but at different spatial locations , have the same frame velocity as a in f at any epoch : @xmath46 if a is an object at rest at an arbitary position in f , the definition of @xmath47 in terms if the epoch @xmath23 and the spatial interval @xmath1 introduced above is : @xmath48}{d { t_{\\rm f } } } = \\frac{d[x({{\\rm a}}',{t_{\\rm f}})-x({{\\rm a}},{t_{\\rm f } } ) ] } { d { t_{\\rm f } } }         =   \\frac{dx({{\\rm a}}',{t_{\\rm f}})}{d { t_{\\rm f } } } = \\frac{dx({{\\rm b}}',{t_{\\rm f}})}{d { t_{\\rm f } } } = ... \\ ] ] since @xmath49 .",

    "note that , although the frame velocity of a ponderable physical object has , in ssrt , the upper limit of @xmath54 , the velocity of light in free space , the upper limit on @xmath42 in the frame f , given by ( 4.5 ) , is @xmath55 .",
