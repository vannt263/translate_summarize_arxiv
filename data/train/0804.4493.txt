    "in heavy - ion collisions electromagnetic probes , i.e. , photons and lepton pairs ( `` virtual photons '' ) provide one of the most valuable possibilities to study the interior of the hot and dense medium created in the interaction over its whole history since their spectra are nearly unaffected by final - state interactions  @xcite .",
    "this paper will be restricted to invariant - mass ( @xmath0 ) and transverse - momentum ( @xmath1 ) spectra of dileptons whose rate is given by  @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the fine - structure constant , @xmath4 the invariant mass of the lepton pair of energy , @xmath5 , and three - momentum , @xmath6 , @xmath7 the temperature , @xmath8 the baryon chemical potential , @xmath9 the bose distribution , and @xmath10 the lepton - phase space factor . as is known from @xmath11 , in the vacuum the retarded hadronic electromagnetic ( em . ) current correlator , @xmath12 , at low invariant masses , @xmath13 is well described by the vector - meson dominance ( vmd ) model for the light vector mesons @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 and by the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) continuum at higher masses ( @xmath17 ) , where @xmath18 denotes a `` duality scale '' .",
    "the hadronic `` resonance part '' is dominated by the isovector channel ( @xmath14 meson ) .    for a theoretical description of dilepton production in relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( hics )",
    "thus the first goal must be an understanding of the in - medium spectral properties of the light vector mesons in the hadronic and the qgp in the partonic phase of the fireball evolution .",
    "this review of recent progress in this field is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sect.emcc ] first the constraints on the em .",
    "current correlator in strongly interacting matter from qcd as the underlying fundamental theory of strong interactions will be discussed , followed by a brief summary on effective hadronic models . in sect .",
    "[ sect.phen ] these models are confronted with data from ultrarelativistic hics . sect .",
    "[ sect.concl ] contains brief conclusions and an outlook .",
    "* ab - initio constraints . * in the vacuum and at low temperatures and densities the light - quark sector of qcd is governed by ( approximate ) _ chiral symmetry _ which is spontaneously broken by the formation of a quarks condensate , @xmath19 , in the qcd vacuum which manifests itself in the mass splitting of chiral partners in the hadron spectrum , as can be seen , e.g. , in the experimental determination of the isovector - vector and -axialvector current correlator through @xmath20 decays  @xcite . from ( lattice ) qcd at finite temperature one expects a decrease of the quark condensate at high temperatures and/or densities and restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "thus the mass spectra of hadrons are expected to soften and to degenerate with their pertinent chiral partners above a critical temperature , @xmath21 .",
    "one indication of the interrelation of chiral symmetry and confinement is that in lattice - qcd ( lqcd ) calculations the critical temperature , @xmath22-@xmath23 , for the chiral and the deconfinement ( cross - over ) transitions coincide  @xcite .    from hadronic modeling two microscopic mechanisms for chiral symmetry restoration ( csr ) have emerged : on the one hand it has been conjectured that the hadron masses drop to zero at the critical point due to the melting of the quark condensate )  @xcite . on the other hand within phenomenological hadronic many - body models",
    "the hadron spectra show a significant broadening with little mass shifts ( `` melting - resonance scenario '' )  @xcite",
    ". a direct relation between in - medium spectral properties of hadrons , in our context particularly vector mesons , to qcd is provided by qcd sum rules which relate moments of the ( in - medium ) spectral functions for various currents in different isospin channels in the space - like region to the pertinent quark and four - quark condensates .",
    "detailed studies  @xcite show that ( in cold nuclear matter ) both the `` dropping - mass '' and the `` melting - resonance '' scenarios for csr are compatible with qcd sum rules .",
    "one objective for the investigation of dileptons in high - energy heavy - ion collisions is thus to gain insight in the in - medium spectral properties of the light vector mesons through the em .",
    "current correlator to constrain the mechanism leading to the softening of the spectral functions . due to the experimental problems to assess the spectral properties of the axial - vector channel",
    ", an indirect theoretical approach may be to connect chiral hadronic models , describing successfully the measured dilepton observables , with csr via finite - temperature weinberg - sum rules  @xcite which relate moments of the _ difference of vector- and axial - vector - current correlators _ to quark and four - quark condensates , i.e. , order parameters of chiral symmetry , providing constraints on these models from lqcd .",
    "* hadronic many - body theory . * a ( model - independent ) approach to assess medium modifications of vector ( and axial - vector ) mesons is based on the chiral reduction formalism , providing a low - density expansion of the in - medium vector- and axial - vector current correlators in terms of the corresponding vacuum quantities which are taken from experimental data such as @xmath24 .",
    "the most intriguing feature of these kind of models is the `` in - medium mixing '' of the vector- with the axial - vector current correlator due to pions in the medium  @xcite which may provide a mechanism for the onset of csr .",
    "however , the applicability of the low - density approximation is restricted to very low temperatures and densities .",
    "another ansatz is to use chiral models in various realizations of chiral symmetry .",
    "one possibility is to describe vector- ( and axial - vector ) mesons as gauge bosons within the _ ( generalized ) hidden - local symmetry models _  @xcite . here a particular realization of chiral symmetry , the _ vector manifestation",
    "_ , becomes possible , where the chiral partner of the longitudinal @xmath14 meson is the pion , thus providing a definite chiral model for the `` dropping - mass scenario '' .",
    "a detailed renormalization - group analysis shows that such a model together with wilson - matching of the effective model to qcd ( leading to an `` intrinsic '' temperature / density dependence of the effective - model parameters ) , inevitably leads to a vanishing @xmath14 mass at the critical point and a violation of vmd  @xcite .    in the hadronic",
    "many - body theory ( hmbt ) approach , starting from a phenomenological lagrangian to describe the vacuum properties of the vector mesons , the in - medium modifications of their spectral properties are evaluated within finite - temperature / density quantum - field theory , involving non - perturbative techniques such as the dressing of , e.g. , the pion propagator to account for the modification of the @xmath14-meson s pion cloud and implementation of interactions of the @xmath14-meson with mesons and baryons in the medium ( for a review , see  @xcite ) .",
    "it is characteristic for such models that the various excitations result in a _ substantial broadening of the vector mesons and small mass shifts _",
    ", i.e. , a realization of the `` melting - resonance scenario '' of csr .",
    "an intriguing property in connection with the model proposed in  @xcite is that the resulting dilepton - emission rates , cf .",
    "( [ mt ] ) , match that of the hard - thermal - loop improved pqcd rate , when both are extrapolated to the expected chiral - phase transition temperature @xmath22-@xmath25 , i.e. , a kind of `` quark - hadron duality ''  @xcite .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the smoothness of quark - number susceptibilities in the corresponding isovector channel across the phase transition in recent lqcd calculations  @xcite .",
    "another approach to assess in - medium properties of vector mesons is the use of empirical scattering amplitudes and dispersion - integral techniques to assess the in - medium @xmath14-meson propagator via the @xmath26 approximation  @xcite .",
    "in this section we compare theoretical models of the in - medium em .",
    "current correlator to experimental results from ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "for such a comparison , not only detailed models for the in - medium behavior of the correlation function itself in both partonic ( qgp ) and hadronic states of the medium are required , but also a description of its entire `` thermal evolution '' over which the rate  ( [ mt ] ) has to be integrated to compare to the experimental observables .",
    "the bulk of hot and dense matter created in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions at the cern sps and rhic can be successfully described by ideal hydrodynamics  @xcite , which implies local thermal equilibrium .",
    "thus the medium is characterized by a temperature- and collective - flow field . in @xcite",
    "a simple thermal model has been used , which after a `` plasma - formation time '' describes the medium by an ideal - gas equation of state of quarks and gluons which according to recent lqcd calculations  @xcite undergoes a phase transition at @xmath22-@xmath27 to a hadron - resonance gas .",
    "thermal models  @xcite for the yields of various hadron species indicate that at a temperature close to the phase transition of @xmath28-@xmath29 , inelastic reactions within the medium cease , and the corresponding particle ratios are fixed ( _ chemical freeze - out _ ) , before the particles decouple and freely stream to the detector .",
    "thermal freeze - out _ occurs at temperatures around @xmath30-@xmath31 ( depending on the system size ) .",
    "this evolution of the medium is implemented through a cylindrical homogeneous fireball model , including radial flow and longitudinal expansion  @xcite .",
    "the temperature is inferred from the equation of state ( massless gluons and @xmath32 effective quark flavors in the qgp and a hadron - resonance gas model in the hadronic phase ) and the assumption of an isentropic expansion in accordance with ideal - fluid dynamics . between the pure qgp and hadronic phases a standard volume partition for a mixed phase",
    "is employed .",
    "the hadronic phase is characterized by the build - up of hadron - chemical potentials to keep the particle - number ratios fixed at the observed values .",
    "the largest uncertainty is the total fireball lifetime which has been adjusted to the total experimental yield .     in semicentral @xmath33 in - in collisions compared to data by the na60 collaboration  @xcite ;",

    "* while earlier dilepton measurements at the sps have shown an enhancement of the dilepton yield at invariant masses in the low - mass region ( lmr ) , @xmath38 , a definite conclusion concerning the nature of the expected csr could not be reached since models for in - medium modifications of the @xmath14 meson based on either the `` dropping - mass '' or the `` melting - resonance '' scenario could describe the data within the experimental mass resolution and errors . only recently with the precision reached in the measurement of dimuon - invariant - mass ( @xmath0 ) spectra by the na60 collaboration  @xcite in @xmath39 in - in collisions , it could be shown that models predicting a broadening of the vector mesons with small mass shifts ( cf . left panel of fig .  [ fig.1 ] ) seem to be favored compared to those implementing the `` dropping - mass scenario '' . as can be seen in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] the same model is also consistent with a recent analysis of @xmath33 pb - au data on the dielectron-@xmath0 spectrum by the ceres / na45  @xcite collaboration . as shown by the comparison with the model only implementing mesonic medium effects , baryonic processes are the prevalent effect leading to the massive broadening of the @xmath14 meson necessary to explain the observed dilepton enhancement in the lmr ( including the related enhancement below the two - pion threshold ) .",
    "while in the lmr the observed access yield over the standard hadronic cocktail is mostly due to the emission from the medium - modified light vector mesons , in the intermediate - mass region ( imr ) , @xmath40@xmath41@xmath42@xmath41@xmath43 , it is either dominated by hadronic `` multi - pion processes '' ( estimated using chiral - mixing formulas ) or @xmath44-annihilation in the qgp phase ( given by hard - thermal loop resummed @xmath45 annihilation )  @xcite , depending on the equation of state ( @xmath21 ) as will be described below . as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] , despite small deviations in the overall yield ( which can be adjusted by slight variations of the fireball lifetime ) , the spectra are robust against details of the equation of state within the boundaries of @xmath21 from lqcd calculations and @xmath46 from thermal - model analyses .",

    "* transverse - momentum spectra . * the dimuon transverse - momentum ( @xmath1 ) spectra and pertinent effective - slope fits by the na60 collaboration  @xcite provide information which is sensitive to the temperature and collective flow of the medium due to the _ blue shift _ of the dileptons radiated from a moving thermal source . while the model in  @xcite describes the @xmath1 spectra for @xmath52 reasonably well",
    "( which is consistent with the agreement in the inclusive @xmath0 spectra ) they were underpredicted at @xmath53 although the fireball parameterization of the temperature and flow agrees well with results from a hydrodynamic calculation  @xcite .",

    "it is important to note that the @xmath1 spectrum for emission from a thermal source cf .",
    "( [ mt ] ) is softer by a lorentz factor @xmath54 compared to that from a freely streaming @xmath14 meson due to the dilation of its lifetime . in former calculations the standard description for dileptons from freeze - out @xmath14 decays has been to prolong the fire - ball lifetime for this contribution by @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "in addition decays of hard `` primordial '' @xmath14 mesons , produced in the initial hard @xmath56 collisions which are subject to jet quenching through the medium but leaving the fireball without equilibrating , have been taken into account .",
    "another source of hard dileptons is drell - yan annihilation in primordial @xmath56 collisions which has been extrapolated to small invariant masses by imposing constraints from the real - photon point .",
    "finally , @xmath57-channel - meson ( e.g. , @xmath15 ) exchange contributions to the yield of thermal dileptons have been studied . although the latter show the hardest @xmath1 spectra among all thermal sources , their absolute magnitude is insufficient to resolve the discrepancies in comparison to the data at high @xmath1 , which however has improved through the above described more detailed implementation of the hard ( non - thermal ) dilepton sources ( cf . fig .

    ", @xmath21 has been varied within the boundaries of @xmath59-@xmath60 given by different lqcd calculations  @xcite ( eos - b : @xmath36 , eos - c : @xmath61 ) , using a chemical freeze - out temperature of @xmath62 to cover the range of thermal - model fits to hadron - number ratios in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "for eos - c a chemically equilibrated hadronic phase between @xmath61 and @xmath37 has been assumed .",
    "the agreement of the model with the measured @xmath0 spectra is robust .",
    "variations in the absolute yield can be adjusted by slight changes in the fireball lifetime .",
    "it is important to note that in the imr the partition of the dilepton yield in hadronic and partonic contributions depends sensitively on the equation of state : a scenario like eos - b with a low critical temperature results in a long qgp+mixed phase , leading to a parton - dominated regime in the imr , while eos - c with a high critical temperature describes a hadron - dominated source since the qgp and mixed phase become shorter .",
    "thus , contrary to suggestions in the literature  @xcite , a definite conclusion whether the dilepton yield in the imr is originating from partonic or hadronic sources can not be drawn at present . in the right panel of fig .",

    "an enhancement of the transverse acceleration of the fireball ( from @xmath66 to @xmath67 ) , leading to larger blue shifts in the spectra , is necessary .",
    "the slopes in the imr are not so sensitive to the radial flow since the emission in this region is dominated by radiation from ( either partonic or hadronic , depending on @xmath21 ) sources at earlier times where the flow is smaller .",

    "current correlator , predicting a strong broadening of the light - vector - meson spectrum with small mass shifts , are favored by the data compared to models implementing a dropping - mass scenario ( as , e.g. , implied by the intrinsic temperature dependencies of the model parameters of the generalized hidden - local symmetry model due to `` wilsonian matching '' with qcd close to @xmath21  @xcite although a final confrontation of this particular realization of chiral symmetry with dilepton data in hics has to be completed by an implementation of baryonic interactions ) .",
