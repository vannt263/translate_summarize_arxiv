    "the kogut - susskind ( ks ) quark action has the well - known feature that su(4 ) flavor symmetry is broken down to u(1 ) subgroup at finite lattice spacing .",
    "the restoration of full flavor symmetry toward the continuum limit has been previously examined for pion mass@xcite . here",
    "we extend the examination to the pion decay constant by comparing results for various ks flavors to that in the u(1 ) channel for which the renormalization constant equals unity .",
    "this comparison is made both for perturbative@xcite and non - perturbative renormalization factors , the latter evaluated@xcite with the method of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "numerical simulations are carried out in quenched qcd at @xmath1 and 6.2 employing @xmath3 and @xmath4 lattices .",
    "other lattice parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : parameter ] .",
    ".lattice parameters of simulation . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the hypercubic notation for the ks fermion fields , the axial vector current in the ks flavor channel @xmath5 has the form @xmath6 the fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 in ( [ eq : axial ] ) are generally separated over a 4-dimensional hypercube .",
    "we use both gauge - invariant and non - invariant operators , inserting the product of link variables between @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the former , and employing the landau gauge fixing to deal with the latter .",
    "the one - loop perturbative results for the renormalization constants @xmath9 have been worked out in ref .",
    "we use tadpole - improved values employing the tadpole - improved @xmath10 coupling with @xmath11 ; they will be denoted as @xmath12 . for non - perturbative renormalization constants",

    "quark propagators are calculated for 16 wall sources , each corresponding to a corner of a hypercube .",
    "these propagators are combined to form the correlator @xmath15 for each flavor @xmath5 , where @xmath16 is the pion field for the wall source , thereby enhancing signals@xcite .",
    "we find the quark mass dependence of @xmath17 , @xmath18 and vector meson masses to be well described by a linear function .",
    "hence a linear fit is employed for the chiral extrapolation in the quark mass @xmath19 .",
    "the scale is set by the @xmath20 meson mass in the spin - flavor channel @xmath21 .",
    "errors are estimated by the single elimination jackknife procedure .",
    "we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : pmass5 ] values of @xmath17 at @xmath22 as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "the 16 ks flavors are grouped into 8 irreducible representations ( irreps ) given by@xcite @xmath24 ( 1-d irreps ) and @xmath25 ( 3-d irreps ) .",
    "we observe that the 8 irreps form a degeneracy pattern @xmath26 at finite lattice spacing .",
    "this feature was initially observed numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite , and recently theoretically explained in ref .",
    "we also see that non - zero values of @xmath17 for the channels other than @xmath27 vanish quadratically in @xmath28 toward the continuum limit as expected .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : fpi1 ] we illustrate how the bare values of @xmath18 change under renormalization , taking results for gauge invariant current at @xmath29 .",
    "the bare values for the 8 irreps again form a degeneracy pattern .",
    "the pattern reflects the distance of @xmath7 and @xmath8 in ( [ eq : axial ] ) , and is different from that of @xmath30 .",
    "the perturbative renormalization constants ( middle frame in fig .",
    "[ fig : fpi1 ] ) help to reduce the discrepancy among the bare values of @xmath18 .",
    "it is clear , however , that the discrepancy is much more reduced with the non - perturbative renormalization constants ( bottom frame ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fpi5-inv ] we plot the continuum extrapolation of the pion decay constants obtained with gauge - invariant currents .",
    "the top figure shows results with perturbative renormalization factors , and the bottom figure with non - perturbative factors .",
    "lines are quadratic fits in @xmath23 following the @xmath31 scaling violation expected for the ks quark action .",
    "similar figures for the decay constants obtained with the gauge non - invariant currents are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fpi5-non ] .    the gauge - invariant current for the flavor @xmath27 does not require renormalization , from which we obtain @xmath2 mev in the continuum limit .",
    "this result is consistent with the experimental value of 92.4(3 ) mev@xcite ; possible deviations due to quenching is not visible within our 7% error .",
    "we observe in figs .",
    "[ fig : fpi5-inv ] and [ fig : fpi5-non ] that the perturbative renormalization factors at one - loop order are not sufficient to ensure restoration of flavor symmetry in the continuum limit .",
    "in contrast , the decay constants evaluated with the non - perturbative renormalization factors agree much better already at finite lattice spacings , and their continuum limits are well convergent , the central values coinciding with each other well within the errors .",
