    "even before the discovery in 1971 of the singularity exhibited by the rotational band at a certain critical value of the nuclear spin @xmath5 , it was gradually becoming clear that we are actually dealing with a situation where the moment of inertia @xmath6 of a nonspherical nucleus varies most significantly . in choosing a reasonable definition of this concept",
    "it is desirable to keep in mind the following considerations , in addition to purely aesthetic ones .",
    "first of all , for completeness and internal consistency of the theory it is important that both definitions of the moment of inertia , that via the lagrangian and that via the hamiltonian , be equivalent .",
    "in addition , in accordance with general physical considerations it is natural to expect that precisely at negative values of the correctly defined moment of inertia the rotation becomes unstable ; this is discussed in more detail in the appendix .",
    "the following definition meets all these requirements : @xmath7 ( the notation is the same as in ref .  1 ) .",
    "we emphasize that these prerequisites do not create any practical difficulties in a concrete comparison with experiment since in formulas like ( 1 ) it is possible to replace the derivatives with respect to @xmath8 by the corresponding directly observable finite differences .",
    "in fact , the widely known bohr - mottelson formula @xmath9 has the property that the finite differences calculated with it agree with the result of the formal differentiation according to ( 1 ) . on the other hand , for @xmath10",
    "the replacement of the derivatives by finite differences suggests itself automatically and no special problems appear .    in our earlier study",
    "[ 1 ] this phenomenon was viewed as a smooth , continuous rearrangement of the angular momentum coupling scheme in the nucleus . for adiabatically slow rotation , @xmath11 , the internal state of the system",
    "is formed mainly by a  nucleon - nuclear symmetry axis \" type of interaction , which is due to the axially symmetric deformation of a nucleus  at rest \" . however , in reality the nucleus is rotating , so that the nucleon - rotation axis interaction ( which here emerges as a certain non - adiabatic correction ) is always effective to some degree . in the entire region @xmath12",
    "there is a complicated  nucleon - nuclear symmetry axis \" plus  nucleon - rotation axis \" coupling scheme of relatively low symmetry and the two interactions , generally speaking , are comparable . however , in a sufficiently strong rotation  field \" the mechanical angular momenta of the individual quasiparticles are aligned parallel to the @xmath13 direction and cease to be oriented along the vector @xmath14 .",
    "it can be said that this corresponds to the simplest , most symmetric nucleon - rotation axis coupling scheme , not directly affecting the direction @xmath14 of the nuclear axis .",
    "then the vector n remains  free , \" that is , it is actually distributed isotropically for @xmath15 .",
    "as a consequence of the increased symmetry of the rotational state at the point @xmath16 the angular velocity of the rotation falls abruptly by some amount @xmath17 and in the isotropic upper phase the moment of inertia displays the seemingly paradoxical limiting behavior @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is some coefficient depending on the particular nucleus and @xmath20 is the rigid body moment of inertia ) .",
    "the theory that we developed earlier [ 1 ] does not claim to be able to calculate the specific values of such parameters as @xmath3 , the discontinuity @xmath17 , or the coefficient @xmath19 for individual nuclei . in relation to this",
    "it should also be noted that the less symmetric lower phase is considerably more difficult to study theoretically .",
    "the main result here is the square - root law @xmath21 according to which the static quadrupole moment vanishes near the curie point .",
    "it seems almost certain that it is not possible to quantitatively determine the value of the critical angular velocity @xmath22 , for example , from only deductive considerations .",
    "however , it is remarkable that for a given @xmath3 the value of @xmath23 to which the rotational velocity falls after its discontinuous decrease , can be calculated in a closed form .",
    "after reaching the rigid body value of the moment of inertia @xmath24 the rotational motion of the two components of nuclear matter can be assumed to be fully concurrent .",
    "let us analyze this rotation in detail , appealing to a physical manifestation of the proton component like the magnetic moment .",
    "it is obvious that here @xmath25 is valid for the gyromagnetic factor . ; see , e.g.  [ 2 ] .",
    "this physical non - equivalence of protons and neutrons must disappear in the solid state limit of rotation .",
    "it is not necessary to take into account spin magnetism of separate nucleons in our macroscopic approach . ]",
    "however , the nuclear magnetic moment can be calculated in a somewhat different way , using the larmor theorem ( see ref .",
    "[ 3 ] , for example ) in , so to speak , its differential form .",
    "if it is favorable for a spherical nucleus to rotate in the above manner , then in an applied magnetic field @xmath26 it can be viewed as rotating , but with an angular velocity decreased by the larmor value @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the proton mass ) .",
    "therefore , the rotational properties of the system that we are interested in here are described by the function @xmath29 , while the change of energy is @xmath30 . according to the usual point of view , the nucleus at a level @xmath8 is a particle having magnetic moment @xmath31 and additional energy @xmath32 in the field ( both the angular momentum vector and the magnetic field vector are assumed to be directed along the @xmath33 axis ) .",
    "let us equate the two expressions for the additional energy of the system in the magnetic field : @xmath34 furthermore , transforming the derivatives according to ( 1 ) and substituting formula ( 7 ) , we also take into account the fact that according to the conventional definition of the nuclear @xmath35 factor , the nuclear magneton @xmath36 must serve as the unit of measurement of the magnetic moment : @xmath37 finally , substituting here the values ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , we find @xmath38    this seemingly natural recovery of the simple proportionality between the angular momentum and the angular velocity sheds additional light on the physical nature of the upper phase . for @xmath39 its characteristics can not depend on such non - universal parameters as the coefficient @xmath19 , for example .",
    "roughly speaking , here we have a fairly clear interpretation of the ordinary rotation of a rigid body .",
    "however , if we move down the band in the negative direction of the @xmath8 axis the stability of this regime deteriorates . in close relation to this the moment of inertia",
    "undergoes an odd , non - monotonic change .",
    "first it falls off , then passes through a minimum , and then approaches the pole according to ( 3 ) . in the region near the transition point @xmath40 of the variable moment of inertia the rotation , of course , can no longer be viewed as simply rigid body rotation .",
    "let us return for a while to the region where the moment of inertia is constant @xmath41 . in our earlier study",
    "[ 1 ] in a somewhat formal manner we found @xmath42 for the rotational velocity .",
    "now , comparing this to formula ( 10 ) , we have @xmath43    therefore , in reaching the pole @xmath0 the effect of the above - mentioned non - monotonic change of the moment of inertia on the rotational velocity is cancelled .",
    "it is easy to find an integral relation expressing this cancellation in a quantitative form . for this according to the second formula in ( 1 ) we integrate the inverse value of the moment of inertia from @xmath3 up to some large @xmath8 ; then , performing an even more trivial integration of the analogous expression with the rigid body moment of inertia @xmath20 , we take into account relation ( 12 ) and the fact that for @xmath44 equation ( 10 ) is valid . as a result",
    "we easily find @xmath45 for practical purposes it is convenient to write this relation in a dimensionless form : @xmath46    in addition to the existing means of determining the location of the phase transition point , formula ( 12 ) permits @xmath3 to be calculated according to the observed velocities @xmath23 . in table",
    "i we compare the results of processing the experimental data by different methods for the twenty - eight rotational bands of nonspherical even - even nuclei that we studied .",
    "the @xmath47-vibrational bands of gadolinium and dysprosium are starred . in column 2",
    "we indicate , of necessity tentatively , the location of the discontinuous decrease of the angular velocity of rotation .",
    "the value @xmath48 is the result of extrapolation according to formula ( 3 ) ( see ref .  1 for more details ) .",
    "the last column gives the value of the critical spin calculated according to ( 12 ) . in calculating the rigid body moment of inertia @xmath20 we used the value of the nuclear radius obtained in ref .",
    "1 @xmath49 cm , which is also in agreement with the data on electron scattering .",

    "it should , however , be noted that the nearness of the magic number @xmath112 can sometimes manifest itself in very unexpected ways .",
    "it can be supposed that the second singularity @xmath113 found experimentally in the ground state rotational band of er@xmath114 ( ref .",
    "4 ) is due to this ; see also table i. in our opinion the construction of more detailed hypotheses on the nature of the  intermediate phase \" @xmath115 is still somewhat premature .",
    "intuition suggests that as the magic nucleus is approached the probability of similar surprises increases .",
    "in fact , for er@xmath116 we already have circumstantial evidence of this supposition . according to the data of ref .",
    "5 , after the first phase transition the moment of inertia , as usual , passes through a minimum , but then rises very steeply , reaching @xmath117 for @xmath118 .",
    "the available information indicates that er@xmath116 will also have a second backbending region .    as an illustration of the agreement between the different methods of finding @xmath3 it is worth noting that the rotational velocity @xmath119 varies within a fairly wide range : from 216 kev for w@xmath4 to 340 kev in the ground state rotational band of ba@xmath120 .",
    "the rigid body moment of inertia @xmath20 increases by roughly a factor of two throughout the entire table .    for nonspherical nuclei sufficiently far from the possible effect of the magic numbers ( see above ) , experimental data on the upper phase are far from abundant .",
    "therefore , the possibilities of directly verifying the integral relation ( 13 ) or ( 14 ) at the present time are very limited . only for w@xmath4",
    "does the moment of inertia , after passing through the minimum , approach the rigid body value with an accuracy of about 4% . in fig .",
    "1 we give the graph of the function @xmath121 in this case .",
    "the accuracy with which the integral of this function becomes zero can be considered satisfactory .",
    "the reason that for tungsten there are few experimental points on a large part of the moment of inertia curve in the upper phase is the following : the ratio @xmath122 is not large , amounting only to 1.88 .",
    "however , there are nuclei for which the value of this parameter is much larger . for dy@xmath114 , for example ,",
    "the number of neutrons @xmath123 is sufficiently far from the magic number and @xmath124 . here",
    "further study of the upper phase makes it possible to construct a more accurate moment of inertia curve using a considerably larger number of experimental points .",
    "beginning , for a rough estimate , from the assumption of similarity to the curve in fig .  1",
    ", we conclude that in the ground state band of dy@xmath114 it is of interest to measure the location of the rotational levels up to @xmath125 , beyond which the moment of inertia becomes practically the rigid body value .",
    "in addition to the data of ref .  6 cited in ref",
    ".  1 on the radiation of ce@xmath126 , for ce@xmath127 and ce@xmath128 . ] verification of the  area theorem \" ( 13 ) for different nuclei , including cases with @xmath129 , would give interesting new material for judging the validity of the theory treating backbending as a macroscopic quantum phenomenon .",
    "we are grateful to i.m .",
    "pavlichenkov for discussing the results of this study .",
    "the considerations discussed below apply equally to either phase @xmath130 .",
    "let us view the level @xmath131 of the ground state rotational band as minimizing the total energy of the nucleus for a given value of the conserved angular momentum of the entire system : @xmath132 using the lagrange multiplier method , we shall drop the auxiliary condition and unconditionally require that @xmath133 this can be rewritten as @xmath134 moving now from the minimum along the actually realized rotational band @xmath135 , let us calculate the energy change @xmath136 with accuracy to second - order terms inclusive : @xmath137    the value @xmath138 of the lagrange multiplier ensures the correct location of the extremum and is a minimum for @xmath139 here we have taken into account the fact that the point @xmath140 was chosen arbitrarily .",
    "comparison with formula ( 1 ) gives @xmath141 therefore , the requirement that the moment of inertia be positive emerges here as the stability condition .",
    "the question of the rotational stability of a nonspherical nucleus can also be approached from a somewhat different viewpoint .",
    "let us as usual denote the spherical angles giving the orientation of the vector @xmath14 ( if convenient it plays the role of the rotational variable , but no separate  rotational hamiltonian \" corresponds to it ) in the stationary space by @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "the state of motion in the angle @xmath142 is , in general , not  pure . \"",
    "the situation with the motion in the azimuthal angle @xmath143 is different : because of the conservation of the @xmath33 component of the total angular momentum it corresponds to the separate wave function @xmath144 for @xmath145 the angular momentum is directed along the @xmath33 axis and the situation is semiclassical : the fully described state ( a.8 ) of regular precession can in this limit be viewed as changing into classical motion in a cyclic trajectory , corresponding to the variation of the azimuthal angle @xmath143 .    in order to remove possible doubts about the validity of using a purely mechanical approach here , we recall that the free rotation of a body in thermodynamic equilibrium is not accompanied by friction ( see ref . 8 , for example ) .",
    "we shall proceed directly from the principle of least action @xmath146 ( see ref .",
    "9 , for example ) .",
    "the extreme values of the angles @xmath147 and @xmath148 are viewed as constants which are not varied : @xmath149 however , let us first consider how the moment of inertia is expressed in terms of the lagrangian @xmath150 .",
    "we have and use from now on usual units . ]",
    "@xmath151 let us now express the hamiltonian @xmath152 in terms of the lagrangian : @xmath153 differentiating ( a.10 ) once with respect to @xmath154 and cancelling @xmath155 from both sides , after some elementary manipulations we easily find @xmath156 comparing this to formula ( 1 ) , we finally find @xmath157 this is precisely the relation between the moment of inertia and the lagrangian that we would naturally expect ; see also the preliminary discussion at the beginning of this article .",
    "let us now return to the principle ( a.9 ) , rewriting it in the form @xmath158 free rotation can occur only as uniform rotation , that is , when the angular velocity is constant : @xmath159 the deviation @xmath160 from this simple law of motion gives rise to a time - dependent variation of the velocity @xmath161 let us find the corresponding variation of the action with accuracy to second - order terms inclusive : @xmath162 ^ 2dt>0.\\ ] ] it is obvious that @xmath163 ^ 2dt>0.\\ ] ] therefore @xmath164 comparing this with formula ( a.ll ) , we find the stability condition ( a.7 ) . states with a negative moment of inertia as violating the principle of least action are unstable and can not be realized as stationary rotational energy levels of a nonspherical nucleus .    in conclusion",
    "let us clarify the nature of the limiting behavior of the lagrangian of the upper phase .",
    "it can be found explicitly in the region near the transition point , where the moment of inertia has a pole behavior ( 3 ) . substituting this formula into ( a.ll ) , using formula ( 30 ) from ref .",
    "1 we can express the angular momentum in terms of the angular velocity and then integrate twice with respect to @xmath155 : @xmath165 the constants of integration are here chosen such that the first derivative gives the angular momentum @xmath166 and the energy ( a.10 ) coincides for @xmath167 with the nuclear excitation energy @xmath168 at the curie point .",
