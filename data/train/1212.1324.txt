    "in few more years the scientific community will be celebrating the centennial year of the two great pillars of modern theoretical physics , quantum mechanics and general relativity , without being able to make them compatible , harmonize them into a single scheme .",
    "quantum mechanics carries the idea of interaction discreteness realized through exchanges of a quantum interaction , a packet of energy and momentum , while general relativity associates the gravitational interaction to the smooth geometry of a curved spacetime .",
    "this incompatibility is a serious problem because they are both unbeatable on fitting the experimental data with high accuracy on their respective domain of validity and applicability .",
    "general relativity overseeds the old newtonian scheme reproducing its dynamics in its newtonian limit , a non - relativistic weak field limit .",
    "there are great challenges facing general relativity @xcite .",
    "the observed accelerated expansion of the universe is an indication that somehow , in some conditions , gravity may become a repulsive interaction .",
    "the old question of the flat rotation curves of stars and galaxies is still unsettled .",
    "these questions have in common very large scales of distances which lead to the above mentioned weak field newtonian limit . which , by the way , is of the same order of the pioneer anomaly @xcite .",
    "this may not be a mere coincidence . ] in the newtonian scheme there were no room for a repulsive gravity but general relativity , assuming its validity on such scales of distance , can handle it in various ways but none without controversy .",
    "the einstein field equations are the equality between , in one side , the geometric one representing the observational data , the field , the test mass acceleration , and , in the other side , the sources , the matter content represented by the stress - energy tensor .",
    "feeding this scheme with the observed data for finding the matter content , an exotic fluid that fulfill this data , may be an easy but certainly dangerous procedure as it raises the popper s falsifiability question if there is no pre - established criteria on the acceptability of what is found . the same observations are valid for the galactic flat rotation curves .",
    "then we have the dark matter and the dark energy controversies .",
    "inflation in cosmology , its nature , what powers it and what smoothly disconnects it is another controversy , or unsettled question in gravitation theory .",
    "these are certainly among the greatest riddles for the modern researcher in gravitation theory .",
    "the objective of this letter is to point to a new remarkable fact that they can altogether be enlightened with just very simple ideas on discrete interactions and no further else assumption . for discrete interaction",
    "it is meant the instantaneous emission / absorption of a quantum of interaction triggered by the instantaneous absorption / emission of a quantum of interaction , with free , straight - line propagation between any two consecutive interactions , in a flat spacetime background . as an illustration we present here the simplest discrete interaction model for gravity between two point - like masses in a non - relativistic relative radial motion ; it can easily be associated to a cosmological model of a spherically symmetric distribution of dust . such kind of naive models , with no free parameters and great variety of levels of complexity , are useful laboratories of ideas in the search for a better understanding of field interactions and quantum to classical transitions .",
    "the resulting dynamics , strongly dependent on the distance scales and on the initial conditions , oscillates between repulsive and attractive phases .",
    "it starts with a repulsive exponential expansion that smoothly changes into a newtonian phase to return later , again to a repulsive expansion .",
    "this rich scenario needs no extra input to develop besides the two point - like masses and discrete interactions .",
    "the well known success of general relativity on high accurately fitting some experimental data does not stand against gravity being a discrete interaction since the very general relativity @xcite , like classical electrodynamics , can be seen as an effective theory of averaged interactions in a discrete interaction context @xcite .",
    "they are both finite discrete interaction theories ; singularities and other well known problems are shown to be consequences of the averaging process in the field definition .",
    "let us consider two point - like masses , m and m , in relative non - relativistic radial motion under a discrete gravitational interaction .",
    "@xmath0 is a test mass ( @xmath1 ) and its momentum and position ( relative to @xmath2 ) are given by @xmath3 as the momentum only changes at discrete points when there is the emission / absorption of an interaction quantum , a graviton , and @xmath4 as there is free straight - line propagation between any two consecutive interactions .",
    "the label @xmath5 counts the number of discrete interactions starting from @xmath6 at the initial position @xmath7 with the initial momentum @xmath8 with such discrete interactions a trajectory is piecewise - linear with vertices at the interaction events , where velocity , as the trajectory tangent vector , is not defined because the discrete interaction causes a sudden change of velocity .",
    "so the notion of acceleration , if not as an approximation , is meaningless since it is null in the free propagation period between two consecutive discrete interaction and is not defined at the vertices .      among many other alternatives ,",
    "we take for our model of classical discrete interaction @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the kinematic coefficient that describes the system free propagation between any two consecutive interactions .",
    "this choice is justified assuming that , let us say , the graviton , propagates with the speed of light @xmath12 and , crudely , that the emission of an interaction quantum is triggered without delay by the absorption of an interaction quantum .",
    "then , in the non - relativistic approximation @xmath13      the dynamics for our model will be chosen with an eye on the above mentioned non - relativistic weak field limit , which , after ( [ dtn ] ) , implies on @xmath14 as the most immediate choice , since @xmath15 requires @xmath16 which fixes the dynamic coefficient @xmath17 as    @xmath18    there is no free - to - be - adjusted constant in this toy model of discrete classical interactions between two point - like masses .",
    "however , we strongly remark that ( [ dpn ] ) is not the unique possible choice , even after ( [ dtn ] ) , and neither the most appropriate considering that the newton s equation is just an approximation to a correct formulation of the problem .",
    "it is , nonetheless , interesting to see that discrete interaction can produce repulsive gravity even in such a quasi - newtonian simple context .    on the other hand , ( [ deltaed ] ) has a price as it requires an approximate continuity on @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( grossly @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) which , with ( [ dtn ] ) and ( [ dpn ] ) , leads to @xmath23 that , for dimensional reasons , must be seen just as a qualitative indication of the existence of such a range of validity for the newtons law of gravity .      a word of caution , with respect to ( [ alpha ] )",
    ", is however necessary .",
    "we are dealing here with the gravitational interaction between two point - like mass . in practice",
    "this would imply on something like the gravitational interaction between two electrons , or neutrinos or some other elementary particle . for a long time still to come this would be a purely academic business ! if @xmath2 is due to a number @xmath24 of point - like masses distributed on a region of radius @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , and uncorrelatedly interacting with @xmath0 , then @xmath27 must be replaced by @xmath28 just for an order of magnitude , we remind that light takes about 8 minutes to reach earth from the sun which can not , obviously , be the order of the @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath24 for the sun is such a huge number that most certainly we will never be able to measure such a tiny lapse of time @xmath29 . on the other hand , in this non - relativistic approach @xmath11",
    "is the only place where @xmath12 , the speed of light , will appear .",
    "we will keep @xmath30 everywhere and in the case we need to consider a real physical observation involving a composed object we just have to replace @xmath12 by @xmath31 : @xmath32 in general we do not know @xmath24 but we can assume , in a gross approximation , that @xmath33 a similar reasoning @xcite must be considered at the moment that @xmath0 absorbs an interaction quantum and if @xmath0 is composed of @xmath34 point - like objects then the dynamic coefficient @xmath17 ( or the probability that this absorption occurs ) is proportional to @xmath34 and then to @xmath0 .",
    "this justifies part of the newton s statement on the gravitational force ( being proportional to the product of the masses ) .",
    "after ( [ dtn ] ) ) and ( [ dpn ] ) , with @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( [ rn ] ) may be written as @xmath37 which can be solved by re - iterations but it is more convenient to use an expansion in series powers of @xmath11 @xmath38 where @xmath39 are coefficients to be determined in terms of the initial conditions @xmath40 @xmath41 and of @xmath5 .",
    "we find @xcite    @xmath42\\ ] ] and for @xmath43 $ ] : @xmath44 @xmath45 where the dots indicate decreasing sequences of @xmath5-binomial numbers .",
    "we have introduced , for convenience , the two constants @xmath46 and @xmath47 , defined as @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are , respectively , the velocity and the escape velocity at the initial position @xmath7 in the standard newtonian potential ; @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath46 is clearly related to the system initial energy .",
    "if we consider in each @xmath39 only the contributions from the term with the highest power in @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) , @xmath55 we have @xmath56    @xmath57    and then , from ( [ xps ] ) , assuming @xmath58 , @xmath59}\\alpha^{2k } a^{k-1}b\\frac{n^{2k}}{(2k)!}+\\sum_{k\\ge0}^{[n/2]}\\alpha^{2k + 1}aa^k\\frac{n^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!}=\\ ] ]    @xmath60}\\frac{b}{a } \\frac{x_{n}^{2k}}{(2k)!}+\\sum_{k\\ge0}^{[n/2]}\\frac{a}{\\sqrt a}\\frac{x_{n}^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!},\\ ] ] with @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 it is a good approximation to replace the partial sums by their respective asymptotic series ,    @xmath64    @xmath65    with @xmath66 and @xmath67 replacing in ( [ pnd ] ) the sum by an integral , which is proved to be valid @xcite at this order of approximation , leads to @xmath68 @xmath69 , which has the physical dimension of linear momentum , is a conserved quantity as it does not change with @xmath5 .",
    "it would be kind of peculiar to have linear momentum conservation under gravitational interaction",
    "but actually it boils down @xcite to energy conservation @xmath70 the dominant - order contributions reproduce the usual newtonian picture of continuous interactions with its known interaction potential .",
    "+      the  potential energy \" , retrieved from the @xmath69 conservation @xmath71 ,    can be seen from a new perspective : we can be interested on knowing the zeroes of the potential , @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in this dominant order contribution approximation",
    "each condition equally leads , with ( [ q ] ) , to the same point at infinity @xmath74 as expected once the potential is the old newtonian one , @xmath75 but it is remarkable the possibility of having two distinct zeroes ( this can happen with the inclusion of sub - dominant contributions ) and then there is a place for a repulsive gravity too , as we will see next .",
    "it is convenient now , for @xmath76 , to combine the initial condition parameters @xmath77 , @xmath50 ( @xmath78 ) and @xmath7 ( or @xmath51 ) into a single one @xmath79 , @xmath80 @xmath81 as @xmath82 is finite with the equality to 1 being only asymptotically reached for @xmath83 we will be assuming from now on @xmath84 except when the opposite is explicitly stated .",
    "including now the next @xmath5-order contributions i.e. the terms with the second highest power of @xmath5 in each @xmath39 , @xmath85 we have , instead of ( [ x2k ] ) and ( [ x2kp1 ] ) , @xmath86 @xmath87 and @xmath88    @xmath89 and they lead , with ( [ xps ] ) , to @xmath90 where @xmath91    @xmath92 @xmath93    @xmath94    @xmath95 the term @xmath96 marks the sub dominant contributions ; being proportional to @xmath97 it shows the importance of the velocity of propagation of the signal ( quanta ) and suggests that the next order of interaction may require a proper relativistic approach . on the other hand @xmath98 does not assure @xmath99 , as long as there is no a priori constraint on the size of @xmath79 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 carry contributions from both the dominant and the sub dominant @xmath5-orders and they will receive contributions from any other lower @xmath5-order that may be added . considering the possibility of including the @xmath103 first @xmath5-orders , ( [ xna2 ] ) can be generalized to    @xmath104    every new @xmath5-order added adds contributions to every @xmath105-coefficient , including the @xmath100 one .",
    "it is a peculiar aspect of these @xmath5-order expansions that the relevance of lower @xmath5-order terms increases as @xmath5 grows in contraposition to the usual approximation expansions in terms of small coupling constants where each order of contribution is fixed .",
    "this is unexpected as in general the gravitational effects decrease with the distance ; these non - newtonian effects increase .",
    "as the distance keeps increasing , contributions from lower @xmath5-orders become more and more relevant .",
    "probably there is a closed form , still to be found , for each @xmath105-coefficient as well as for the entire equation of which the expansion ( [ xnak ] ) would be just a partial sum .",
    "on the other hand there is no point on adding new contributions if they only become relevant with distances that go beyond our observation horizon .",
    "let us compare ( [ xnh1 ] ) and ( [ xna2 ] ) .",
    "they represent two distinct perspectives , two different approaches to the dynamics of gravity .",
    "( [ xnh1 ] ) stands for the non - relativistic weak - field limit of general relativity , for the vision of an interaction field as continuous as a smooth surface while ( [ xna2 ] ) shows additional consequences of accumulated effects of successive discrete interactions .",
    "let us now point to some striking differences between them .    while ( [ xnh1 ] ) describes just one phase evolution , ( [ xna2 ] )",
    "describes a multi - phase one .",
    "the dynamics is very sensitive to the initial conditions .",
    "@xmath106 reduces ( [ xna2 ] ) to ( [ xnh1 ] ) as it turns the sub dominant @xmath5-order contributions negligible . on the other hand as @xmath5 ( or equivalently the distance or the time ) increases , the last two terms on the right - hand side of ( [ xna2 ] ) , proportional to @xmath107 , and that we are calling the sub dominant contributions , increases ( @xmath107 times)faster and",
    "may compete or even dominate , radically changing the dynamics .",
    "let @xmath108 mark the point where these two contributions grow even ; for @xmath109 the non - newtonian effects increase faster than the newtonian ones but for @xmath110 ( [ xna2 ] ) reduces to @xmath111 which is just ( [ xnh1 ] ) with different constants .",
    "the dynamics is strongly dependent on the initial conditions and , even after this simplification , it still encompass a great variety of physical situations of which we mention here some few .",
    "the same procedure applied to ( [ xnh1 ] ) leads @xcite now to a distinct conservation law @xmath112 with @xmath113 and leads to a dominant logarithmic contribution to the potential    @xmath114      the interesting result comes from the other extreme condition @xmath116 whose gradient produces an effective  acceleration \" @xmath117 an @xmath118-dependence like that could explain the flat rotation curves of galaxies . besides , considering the conservative potential we can imagine , just to simplify , that a given star was carried to its actual state from an energetically equivalent initial position @xmath119 and an initial velocity @xmath120 , then the condition ( [ wb1 ] ) reduces to    @xmath121 or@xmath122 where @xmath123 is the newtonian value for the star acceleration at @xmath118 which must be bigger than a reference value in a kind of twisted milgron s condition @xcite , in reference to an empirically found condition satisfied by most of flat rotation curves of galaxies .",
    "the nagging point is that plugging back the @xmath24 factor of ( [ cnm ] ) turns the condition ( [ wb1 ] ) into @xmath124 which can be realized only with few - components objects like elementary particles as they have small values of @xmath24 ( @xmath30 ) , @xmath125 , excluding any macroscopic object , not to mention a star or galaxy .",
    "it is saying that the gravitational interaction between two elementary particles could , in principle ( it depends on @xmath79 , the initial conditions as the dynamics is very sensitive to them ) radically differ from the one we know between macroscopic objects in usual conditions ! had we only a dream technology capable of measuring such discrepancies !",
    "the discrete interaction toy model considered in this paper can easily be associated to a newtonian cosmological model of a spherically symmetrical distribution of dust of which @xmath0 is the mass of the point dust at @xmath118 and @xmath2 is the total mass of the dust spherically distributed inside the sphere of radius @xmath118 .",
    "it is mostly a consensus that inflation , an early exponential expansion of the universe , is a necessary ingredient of big - bang cosmologies despite the many questions lingering on , waiting for consistent answers .",
    "questions like , how did inflation started ?",
    "powered by what ?",
    "and how did it smoothly ended into the present known state of the universe ?",
    "similar questions can also be made with respect to the observed accelerated expansion of the universe , that seems to require an evolution system with a repulsive gravitation phase .",
    "discrete interaction , we believe , have something to add on these issues .      in the dynamics described by ( [ xna2 ] )",
    "there are two main exponential expansion phases , an early and a late one .",
    "let us start re - writing it as @xmath126 @xmath127 from which we can see that it describes an exponential expansion as long as @xmath128 or    @xmath129    and also when @xmath130    as @xmath131 and @xmath132 it is natural that if we want to use this discrete interaction model for pursuing a more comprehensive understanding of gravity we must consider the whole ( [ xna2 ] ) and not just ( [ xna3 ] ) . to repeat with ( [ xna2 ] )",
    "the same treatment given to ( [ xnh1 ] ) and to ( [ xna3 ] ) is not as easy but we can do , for now , with numerical computation for a glance on its dynamics .",
    "see the figures below where we have used the command    @xmath133 , \\{h ,     h_{min } , h_{max}\\}]\\ ] ] of the software mathematica 8.0 which is very useful as it allows the observation of the dynamics dependence on the initial conditions through the explicit variation of @xmath79 . for the figure 1 , showing the repulsive , attractive and again repulsive sequence of phases , we have plotted the `` acceleration  @xmath134 against @xmath135 for ( [ xna2 ] ) with @xmath136 and with the initial conditions partially fixed by taking @xmath137 and leaving @xmath7 free , hidden in the parameter @xmath79 which was allowed to vary in the range from @xmath138 to @xmath139 and @xmath140 ( that stands here for @xmath135 ) from 0 to @xmath141 .",
    "increasing the range of @xmath140 would mean including distances beyond , perhaps , our observation horizon ; for consistency this would require including more @xmath5-order contributions .",
    "a smaller @xmath79 implies , for a fixed initial velocity , a larger escape velocity which means , for a fixed @xmath2 , a smaller initial position , while a larger @xmath79 implies @xmath51 closer to @xmath50 . for comparison , using ( [ xnh1 ] ) instead of ( [ xna2 ] ) , for the same initial conditions , produces figure 2 and an always negative newtonian ' ' acceleration ",
    "@xmath142 @xmath143 in its unique attractive phase .        ,",
    "width=474,height=457 ]    we should observe that in both figures the scales of @xmath135 in the horizontal axis are not linear with the scale of distance @xmath144 ; they are related by ( [ xnh1 ] ) and ( [ xna2 ] ) , respectively . in the notation of mathematica , with the chosen initial condition",
    ", we write ( [ xna2 ] ) as @xmath145@xmath146 + \\]]@xmath147.\\ ] ] changing @xmath79 changes the overall aspect of the plot but not the existence of changes of sign in the  acceleration \" as it is naturally dependent on the initial conditions .",
    "the choice of the snapshot taken at @xmath148 just reflects the author s esthetic bias without any further deep physical concern .",
    "the objective of this paper of pointing to the relevance of discrete interaction models as laboratory of ideas in the search for a better comprehension of field interaction and of its discrete to continuous or quantum to classical transitions has been accomplished .",
    "although being based on a very simple classical model of discrete interactions for gravity and being mirrored on the non - relativistic weak field limit of general relativity which is just an approximation to a correct formulation of the problem it makes contact with actual major issues in the physics of gravity .",
    "most remarkable , of course , is the natural appearing of repulsive gravity in a simple quasi - newtonian context . the next question is how far can it go .",
