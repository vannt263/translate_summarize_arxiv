    "one of the most significant results from recent x - ray studies of nearby galaxies is the discovery of a number of non - nuclear point sources ( ultraluminous x - ray sources - ulx ) with apparent ( isotropic ) x - ray luminosities of 10@xmath210@xmath3 erg / s , a factor of 101000 times brighter than typical luminous x - ray binaries in our galaxy .    from x - ray timing and spectral studies",
    "it is clear that ulxs are accreting compact objects .",
    "therefore , their luminosity should not exceed the eddington limit @xmath4  m / m@xmath0  erg / s .",
    "one possible explanation is that the accreting object powering an ulx is an intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ) , with m @xmath5 10@xmath6 - 10@xmath7 m@xmath0 ( ( * ? ? ? *",

    "* makishima  2000 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* miller , fabian & miller 2004 ) ) .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the emission is beamed along the observer s line of sight , either by geometrical effects ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* king  2001 ) ) , or due to relativistic jets like in microquasars ( ( * ? ? ? * fabrika & mesheryakov 2001 ) ) , so that the true total luminosity does not exceed the eddington limit of a stellar - mass black hole . yet another possibility is that the accretor is a stellar bh genuinely emitting above the classical eddington limit ( ( * ? ? ? *",
    "begelman 2002 ) ) .",
    "at the same time , one has to explain the high accretion rate ( up to @xmath5 10@xmath8 m@xmath0/yr ) required by the inferred luminosities .",
    "wind accretion ( typical for high - mass x - ray binaries ) or bondi - hoyle type accretion from the interstellar medium are clearly too inefficient .",
    "it is more likely that the mass transfer occurs via roche - lobe overflow from a donor star to the black hole .",
    "stable , high mass transfer can proceed on a nuclear time scale ( @xmath9 several 10@xmath10 yr ) , if the mass donor is massive - but not much more massive than the black hole ( cf .",
    "* rappaport , podsiadlowski & pfahl 2005 ) ) .",
    "an important piece of information for our understanding of ulx comes from the discovery of huge ionised bubble nebul  around a significant fraction of unobscured ulx in nearby galaxies ( pakull & mirioni 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "it is even likely that all ulx sources are surrounded by such structures .",
    "close to the x - ray source , we sometimes observe x - ray ionisation effects which in the case of holmberg  ii x-1 has allowed to independently measure the ( ionising ) x - ray luminosity ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pakull & mirioni 2002 ) ) .",
    "the presence in the outer regions of strong [ s  ii ] and [ o  i ] emission lines and of supersonic expansion speeds of 80 - 250 km / s derived from the width of h@xmath11  emission show that ( at least the outer parts of ) the bubbles are shock - excited rather then photoionised .    among the best - studied large ulx bubbles",
    "are mh  9 - 11 around holmberg  ix x-1 ( cf .",
    "gris , this symposium ) and ngc  1313 x-2 which both have diameters of about 500 pc , i.e. they are much larger than supernova remnants .",
    "one of the many interesting aspects of ulx bubbles is that we might estimate the kinetic energy involved in the ulx phenomenon .",
    "two possibilities for bubble formation have been discussed : either they were formed in an explosive event with kinetic energy @xmath12 ( possibly the sn explosion that created the compact component in the ulx ) , or they are being inflated by ulx stellar wind / jet activity with mechanical energy @xmath13 .",
    "assuming for simplicity that energy is largely conserved ( sedov - taylor solution ) , we have for the snr case @xmath14 and for the wind / jet case @xmath15 here r@xmath16 is the radius in units of 100 pc , and v@xmath16 is the expansion velocity in units of 100 km / s of a bubble having an age of 10@xmath17 t@xmath18 yrs . the interstellar particle density , n , into which the bubble expands can be estimated from comparing the observed h@xmath11  emission with the intensity i@xmath19 10@xmath8 i@xmath20  erg  @xmath21 s@xmath22 sr@xmath22 of a fully radiative shock ( ( * ? ? ? * dopita & sutherland 1996 ) ) : @xmath23    straightforward application of these equations to ulx bubbles yields typical ages of 10@xmath17 yrs and densities in the range of 0.11.0 @xmath24 .",
    "this results in very large energy / power requirements of @xmath5 10@xmath25 erg for the snr case , and @xmath5 10@xmath26 erg s@xmath22 for continuous inflation .",
    "however , a snr is likely to expand into a region of very low density that has previously been excavated by the stellar winds from an evolving cluster ( see below ) before hitting the walls of that superbubble. in this way , energy requirements could well be ten times lower , and more akin to typical sn energies of 10@xmath27 erg .",
    "another complication arises from the clumpiness of the interstellar medium which results in smaller shock velocities in the dense optically emitting clouds as compared to a higher velocity of the main shock in the intercloud medium . taking into account this effect ,",
    "@xcite estimated the kinetic of snr to be : @xmath28 where n(sii ) is the density in the recombination zone behind the shock , as measured by the well - known forbidden [ sii ] line ratio . however , this method is not without severe problems either , as the energy calculated in this way appears to be positively correlated with the remnant diameter , an effect that may be related to the magnetic pressure in the dense clouds .",
    "as outlined below , we favour the possibility of ongoing inflation by stellar winds / jets which would require for reasonable mass loss rates @xmath910@xmath8 m@xmath0/yr mildly relativistic ejection velocities akin to the famous v=0.26c jets in ss  433",
    ". however , inflation into a cloudy medium would also lower the power requirements somewhat .",
    "most massive stars are born in clusters or associations .",
    "searching for such birthplaces of ulx thus opens the possibility to learn more about their ages and possible formation scenarios .",
    "for the relatively isolated ulx in holmberg  ix and in ngc  1313 x-2 we have been able to identify small faint clusters of stars that in each case are clearly associated with the ulx ( cf .",
    "gris , this symposium ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     multicolour photometry and isochrone fitting yield ages of some 40 - 70 myrs and total cluster masses of some 10@xmath29 m@xmath0 .",
    "thus , all ionising o stars have already exploded a long time ago , implying again that the nebul  can not possibly be photoionized by stellar euv continua .",
    "this has an important consequence for the mass donor component in the ulx : it can not be more massive then about 8 m@xmath0 . furthermore ,",
    "if the bubble nebul  indeed represent the remnants of the formation process of the ulx black holes , then these explosions ( which took place about 1 myr ago ) have taken place in an advanced stage of cluster evolution , i.e. the progenitor stars of the ulx accretors would not have been much more massive then the current donors ( i.e. @xmath9 10 m@xmath0 ) .",
    "such stars are of course not likely to become massive black holes .",
    "we are therefore left with the hypothesis that the ulx nebulae represent @xcite beambags of jet inflation like the ears in the ( radio ) nebula w  50 around ss  433 .",
    "the optical counterparts of ulxs holmberg  ix and ngc  1313 x-2 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) have visual magnitudes of 22.9 and 23.4 , respectively , and blue optical colors ; at a distance of 34 mpc this translates into . optical spectra taken with the eso vlt and with the subaru telescope",
    "reveal the presence of stellar he  ii @xmath14686  emission with equivalent width of 10 and 18  , respectively .",
    "this high excitation line can be considered a hallmark of x - ray binaries , being formed in the x - ray heated disk around the compact component . in galactic high mass x - ray binaries ( such as the l@xmath30=10@xmath31 erg / s systems cen x-3 , smc x-1 , lmc x-4 , etc ) the corresponding ews are more than an order of magnitude smaller , attesting to their much smaller x - ray luminosities .",
    "therefore , the presence of strong he  ii @xmath14686  emission in ulx might also be taken as strong evidence against the x - ray beaming scenarios mentioned earlier .",
    "we note by the way that a he  ii @xmath14686  emitting wolf - rayet star interpretation can be ruled out given the advanced age of the cluster .",
    "strong support for an accretion disk interpretation comes also from its position in the famous @xmath32 ",
    "m@xmath33 diagram of low mass x - ray binaries ( i.e. of x - ray ionised disks ) , at the very high - luminosity end of this relation . here",
    ", @xmath32 is proportional to the optical light expected from an accretion disk that is heated by a given x - ray luminosity ; note that we have assumed a semi - detached binary of some 20 m@xmath0  total mass and an orbital period of a few days .",
    "the rhs of fig .",
    "1 illustrates two observations of the ngc  1313 x-2 counterpart separated by about three weeks .",
    "it appears that the he  ii @xmath14686  emission has varied in radial velocity ( rv ) by about @xmath5 300 km / s around the velocity of the local h  i gas in the galaxy ( dotted line ) .",
    "_ if _ this variation reflects real rv changes ( as opposed to possible profile changes of the line having intrinsic fwhm @xmath5600 km / s ) , then the object in the center of the accretion disk can not be very massive , i.e. one could rule out the presence of an imbh .",
    "we finally mention variations by @xmath50.2 mag amplitude over 9 nights in our b band photometry of the optical counterpart of ngc  1313 x-2 .",
    "however , no stricly periodic signal is seen , such as expected from ellipsoidal variations , and we ascribe these changes to variable x - ray heating of the accretion disk ."
