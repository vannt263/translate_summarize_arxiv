    "the two best known black hole binary states are the low / hard and high / soft states .",
    "the low / hard state is dominated by hard ( photon index @xmath1 ) comptonised emission from a hot , optically thin flow whereas the high / soft state is instead dominated by soft , blackbody emission from a cool , optically thick disc .",
    "the transition between these two states is generally interpreted in terms of the truncated disc model , where in the low / hard state the inner thin , cool , radiatively efficient disc evaporates into a geometrically thick , hot , advection dominated flow ( e.g. , esin , mcclintock , & narayan 1997 ) .",
    "spectra around the transition are rather rare since the transitions are fast , but these ( hard and soft ) intermediate states ( hims / sims ) show both a strong disc and strong but soft ( @xmath2 ) comptonised tail . there is also a distinct branch , the very high state ( vhs ) , on the hardness - intensity diagram at the highest luminosity where the spectral shape is similarly a composite of a strong disc and strong , steep comptonised spectrum  @xcite .",
    "these transition spectra are of especial importance as they are associated with dramatic changes in the radio emission from the jet . the steady compact jet seen in the low / hard state ( gallo , fender & pooley 2003 ; or corbel",
    "et al 2013a for an up to date version ) collapses as the source makes a transition to the disc dominated states .",
    "this collapse takes place via discrete plasma ejection events which can impact into the previous jet material , producing optically thin synchrotron emission from internal shocks @xcite .",
    "extrapolating back from the observed proper motion of the shocked radio plasma indicates that the initial ejection takes place around the time where the fast x - ray variability properties change dramatically ( e.g. miller - jones et al 2012 ) .",
    "the ubiquitous broad band noise seen in the x - ray variability in the low / hard state suddenly collapses , correlated with a more subtle change in the low frequency quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) from type c to b , and an even more subtle spectral softening ( from hims to sims ) .",
    "it is very tempting to associate this very obvious change in timing signature with the ejection event ( jet line , fender et al .",
    "2004 ) , but this is probably not a causal connection as some objects with good monitoring campaigns show that the radio collapses before the change in timing ( gx  @xmath0 : fender 2009 ; maxi  j@xmath3 : van der horst et al 2013 ) .    nonetheless , the steady compact jet is normally seen together with the type c qpo .",
    "the current best model for this qpo involves lense - thirring ( vertical ) precession of the entire hot inner flow region within the truncated disc ( ingram , done & fragile 2009 ) , so this associates the steady jet with a geometrically thick , hot inner flow .",
    "however , testing whether this truncated disc / hot inner flow geometry really does apply in the hims / vhs spectra is not easy .",
    "the inner edge of the thin disc can be tracked in the disc dominated states , and is consistent with extending down to a fixed inner radius despite large changes in mass accretion rate @xcite .",
    "however , the hims / vhs are characterised by strong soft comptonisation of the disc emission , which can distort the observed disc emission in two ways .",
    "firstly , strong comptonisation implies that not all of the accretion energy is dissipated in the disc . in a disc - corona geometry",
    ", this means that the underlying disc is cooler and less luminous than expected @xcite .",
    "secondly , the comptonisation process itself removes photons from the disc spectrum to scatter them into the compton spectrum .",
    "thus there is coupling of both energy and photon number between the disc and comptonisation region . in the studies of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite",
    "( hereafter t12 ) , we assumed that this coupling was between a disc and thermal compton component .",
    "however , the strong compton tail in the vhs / hims is often seen to have a composite shape , requiring a non - thermal electron distribution as well as thermal electrons @xcite . in our previous work",
    ", we assumed that this non - thermal emission had negligible impact on the energy and photon coupling between the disc and corona .",
    "this is not necessarily true .    in this paper , we build a new model ` diskeq ' to explore the geometry and energetics of these complex hims / vhs .",
    "we use the novikov - thorne thin disc emissivity to specify the local energy release . at large radii",
    "we assume that this emission is dissipated as a ( colour temperature corrected ) blackbody as in a standard disc .",
    "we allow this to make a transition in the inner region to an energetically coupled disc - corona , where the coronal electrons can have a hybrid ( thermal and non - thermal ) electron distribution , modeled using the eqpair code @xcite .",
    "we then allow the disc - corona to make a further transition to a hot inner flow , where again the electrons can have a hybrid electron distribution .",
    "we use this to fit the vhs / hims spectrum of a black hole binary gx  @xmath0 observed with suzaku , and compare this with a disc dominated spectrum seen from the same object three days later with xmm - newton and rxte in order to get the best possible constraints on any change in geometry and energetics between these two states .    in section  2 ,",
    "we describe observations of the vhs with suzaku and the high / soft state with xmm and rxte .",
    "details of the new model are given in section  3 .",
    "the high / soft state spectrum is fit in section  4 .",
    "this is disc dominated , so it constrains black hole spin .",
    "this is rather low for our assumed system parameters , in conflict with the very high black hole spin derived from a recent re - evaluation of the iron line profile in multiple datasets , including the vhs suzaku data studied here @xcite .",
    "we fit the vhs spectra firstly with simple models in section  5 and show that the high spin / high reflected fraction derived by ludlam et",
    "al ( 2015 ) is degenerate with the continuum complexity which comes from allowing a hybrid ( rather than purely power law ) electron distribution .",
    "we then fit the vhs spectra with our new disc model , to show that it requires an inner flow which is underluminous compared to the mass accretion rate inferred through the outer disc .",
    "while this might signal that a substantial fraction of the accretion luminosity is used to power the jet , the absence of strong radio emission during this observation makes this unlikely .",
    "we conclude that either the flow has not yet reached steady state from the rapid rise to outburst and/or that the novikov - thorne accretion emissivity derived for a thin disc is not appropriate for the more complex accretion flow geometry considered here .",
    "as described in t12 , the 2006/2007 outburst of gx  @xmath0 was its brightest outburst since the launch of rxte in 1995 .",
    "the light curves and hardness ratio of this outburst ( figure 1 of t12 ) showed that the state transition occurred around mjd@xmath45414054150 , and that the suzaku observation was performed just before the peak of the rxte count rate ( mjd 54143.254146.2 ; 2007 february 12th 05:33:31 to 15th 04:48:26 ) .",
    "both the qpo ( type c , increasing from 4.3 - 5.5  hz ) and spectral properties ( @xmath5 increasing from 2.6 - 2.7 ) characterize the source as being in the vhs during the suzaku observation ( t12 ) .    data reduction is described in t12 , but we redo this by aepipeline ( version 1.1.0 ) implemented in heasoft  6.16 using the same selection but with the latest calibration files released on 2014 june 24th .",
    "as before , we mitigate pileup in the xis by using only xis0 data , and extract events from a circular annulus from 7@xmath63@xmath6 , to exclude the core @xcite . further excluding events with telemetry saturation gave an exposure time of 2.83  ks out of the total 12.4  ks observation .",
    "we use the xis0 data from 0.71.5  kev and 2.310  kev , including 1% systematic error on each energy bin .",
    "we similarly reprocessed the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; @xcite ) data from both pin and gso data with aepipeline with their standard criteria .",
    "following t12 , both the non x - ray background ( nxb ) and the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) were subtracted from the pin spectrum , and only nxb was subtracted from the gso spectrum . for the spectral analyses",
    ", we used 1270  kev pin data with the response matrix of ae_hxd_pinxinome3_20080129.rsp , and used 50200  kev gso data with the response matrixes of ae_hxd_gsoxinom_20100524.rsp and ae_hxd_gsoxinom_crab_20100526.arf @xcite .",
    "systematic errors of 1% were added to each energy bin for the pin spectrum .",
    "we also added 0.5% to the gso background spectrum to consider the effect of a systematic uncertainty of up to 3% in the gso background .",
    "the cross normalization of pin and gso to xis0 are fixed at 1.16 , since the observation was performed at the xis nominal position .",
    "we use the high / soft state data from xmm and rxte taken at the peak of the rxte / asm count rate ( mjd 54150.0154150.20 ; 2007 february 19th 00:20:54 to 04:43:28 ) .",
    "the xmm - newton data are in burst mode , with net exposure of 448  s , while the contemporaneous rxte data have net exposure of 3.23  ks ( see kolehmainen , done , & daz trigo 2011 ) .",
    "we use the energy range 0.62.0  kev and 2.410  kev for the xmm / pn , 730  kev for the rxte / pca , and 30150 kev for the rxte / hexte .",
    "we use systematic errors of 1% to the each energy bin for the xmm / pn spectrum .",
    "this is lower than the 2% used by kolehmainen et al .",
    "( 2011 ) as we do not include the rxte data in the energy range of 3 - 7  kev where the cross - calibration errors are large ( kolehmainen et al .",
    "the energetically coupled disc and corona model , dkbbfth @xcite , used to fit these data in t12 is based on the diskbb @xcite emissivity i.e. assumes that the local energy release is proportional to @xmath7 in the disc over all radii from @xmath8 down to @xmath9 .",
    "this gives a temperature distribution @xmath10 if it thermalises to a blackbody , so it is parameterised by an inner disc temperature , @xmath11 , and radius @xmath9 .",
    "we upgrade this to use the fully general relativistic novikov - thorne emissivity @xcite , which includes the full stress - free inner boundary condition .",
    "the free parameters are then the three physical parameters of mass , mass accretion rate and black hole spin .    as in dkbbfth , the model assumes that this energy is dissipated as an optically thick blackbody from @xmath8 to @xmath12 .",
    "however , the optically thick disc emission is now explicitly corrected for electron scattering in the disc via a self consistently calculated colour temperature correction @xcite , rather than having this as an additional free parameter .",
    "we calculate the colour tempearture corrected blackbody flux on a radial grid with at least 20 points per decade .",
    "we then use the eqpair code ( e.g.,coppi  1992 ) to describe the comptonisation , so that the electron distribution can be a mix of thermal and non - thermal ( hybrid ) .",
    "the spectral shape of eqpair is parameterised using the ratio of power injected into the electrons ( hard power , @xmath13 ) to the luminosity of seed photons intercepted by the source ( seed photon luminosity , @xmath14 ) .",
    "both these are parameterised as a compactness i.e. a dimensionless luminosity to size ratio i.e. @xmath15 , and the ratio @xmath16 .",
    "a further parameter sets the fraction of non - thermal acceleration compared to the total ( non - thermal plus thermal ) electron power @xmath17 .",
    "any non - thermal electrons are assumed to be injected with a power law spectrum , @xmath18 , between @xmath19 and @xmath20 while the thermal ones have a maxwellian distribution . both thermal and non - thermal electrons cool via compton and coulomb collisions to form a self - consistent hybrid electron distribution , @xmath21 .",
    "even completely non - thermal acceleration gives a steady state distribution which is thermal at low energies due to the effect of coulomb collisions .",
    "we fix the minimum and maximum electron lorentz factors @xmath19 and @xmath22 at 1.3 and 1000 , respectively , leaving only @xmath23 as the free parameter of the non - thermal electron injection .",
    "the code includes the effects of photon - photon pair production , so the self - consistent electron optical depth @xmath24 .",
    "we consider several geometries for the electrons in the vhs , as shown schematically in figure 1 .",
    "firstly ( fig 1a ) we assume the comptonising corona overlies the inner portion of an untruncated inner disc as in the dkbbfth model but with the more flexible eqpair model to describe the comptonised emission , allowing the electrons to be non - thermal as well as thermal . we assume that all the electron parameters remain constant with radius in the coupled disc - corona region , and that the accretion power dissipated in radii between @xmath12 to @xmath25 is split between the disc and corona , with a fraction @xmath26 powering the corona , and the remaining @xmath27 powering the underlying disc @xcite . hence the underlying disc emission is both less luminous and cooler than a pure disc without a corona . however , there is also reprocessing of the hard x - rays in the disc , which adds to the seed photons , so the ratio of coronal power to seed photon luminosity , @xmath28 , which is the major determinant of the shape of the spectrum is not simply @xmath29 .",
    "instead , we use @xmath30 derived from the shape of the spectrum to define a new parameter @xmath31 which includes the contribution of reprocessed / reflected flux .",
    "the relation of @xmath32 to @xmath26 is described in appendix b , but they are equal only if the albedo @xmath33 in the coupled disc - corona region , so that all the flux is reflected rather than reprocessed .",
    "we calculate comptonisation locally , splitting the coupled disc - corona region up into multiple regions , again using a radial grid with at least 20 points per decade . the soft compactness in each annulus of width",
    "@xmath34 is @xmath35\\times ( \\sigma_{\\rm t}/ m_e c^3)$ ] , while the intrinsic hard compactness is @xmath36\\times ( \\sigma_{\\rm t}/ m_e c^3)$ ] .",
    "the eqpair code returns both transmitted ( unscattered ) seed photons and comptonised photons together , but the transmitted seed photons can be separately calculated with a second call to eqpair using the sign of the seed photon compactness as a switch@xmath37 .",
    "we use this to separate out the comptonised and unscattered seed photons , at each radius , and then add together the comptonised seed photons from all anuuli to form a single comptonised spectrum for plotting purposes , and for convolution with the rfxconv and kdblur models to produce the self - consistent ionised reflected emission from this region . similarly we add together all the unscattered seed photons from all radii in the coupled disc - corona region , again so that we can show these as a single component for plotting .",
    "we also consider the case where the innermost radius of the coupled disc corona is truncated before the isco , where the remaining power is dissipated in a hot inner flow .",
    "this geometry allows a smooth transition between the truncated disc models used for the low / hard state and the vhs geometry .",
    "this inner flow region is also required by the lense - thirring precession models for the low - frequency qpo as a vertical oscillation is suppressed if there is a disc in the midplane ( ingram , done & fragile 2009 ) .",
    "we again use eqpair to model this comptonised emission so that this can also be non - thermal / hybrid , and set @xmath38 from the remaining accretion power between where the disc truncates , @xmath39 , and @xmath25 i.e. we assume @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a factor to allow the flow to be radiatively inefficient as might be the case if it powers a strong jet .",
    "this sets @xmath42 .    in this inner region , we only calculate a single eqpair model as we assume a single seed photon temperature which is set by that of the innermost edge of the disc i.e. that they are a blackbody with temperature equal to that of the disc in the coupled disc - corona region ( or the standard outer disc if @xmath43 when the coupled coronal region does not exist ) .",
    "these seed photons for the inner region are produced in at different radius , so their energy adds to that released in the inner region .",
    "it is not removed from the region where the seed photons are generated as these photons are intercepted by the corona along a different line of sight than is observed .",
    "hence only the comptonised photons are seen , as any seed photons which are transmitted rather than scattered are not in the observers direction . the fraction of seed photons which intercept the flow depends on the detailed structure of the corona ( scale height , and radial electron emissivity ) . since these are unknown , we set @xmath38 as above , then have @xmath28 as a free parameter and then determine after the fit whether the required @xmath14 is physically reasonable e.g. a spherical source within a truncated disc can intercept at most @xmath44 of the photons from the disc@xcite .",
    "again we separate out the comptonised photons ( using the sign of @xmath39 as a switch ) so as to be able to compute the self - consistent reflected emission .     spectrum and residuals between the data and the best fit models of gx@xmath0 in the high / soft state .",

    "allowing the disc ionisation to be free switches the fit to being reflection dominated , which does not then conserve energy since most of the continuum which produces the observed enhanced reflection is not included in the energy budget . since none of these fits are acceptable , we do not give detailed parameters .",

    "however , this could also indicate instead that the stresses are as expected for the black hole spin , but that the accretion flow makes a transition from the coupled disc - corona to a hot inner flow at radii @xmath121 , as required for the qpo models .",
    "also , this would require that this flow is strongly radiatively inefficient so as to compensate for the additional energy released between a stress - free truncation at @xmath120 as expected from novikov - thorne , and the stress - free truncation at @xmath122 which fits the data above .",
    "we fix @xmath123 , and @xmath107 but now allow the disc - corona region to be truncated , with additional inverse compton emission from the innermost region between the disc truncation radius and the isco ( see the schematic geometry in figure 1b ) .",
    "we assume that the inner region also has completely non - thermal electron acceleration , with @xmath107 , again with fixed reflection ionisation and smearing ( now tied to the inner edge of the disc - corona , i.e. @xmath39 ) .",

    "detailed fits to the variability power spectrum of a vhs of similar qpo frequency in xte  j1550564 gives @xmath136 for the transition between the disc and inner flow ( obs 5 in ingram & done 2012 ) .",
    "however , these qpo models also rely on the misaligned flow not extending down to the isco but being truncated at the bending wave radius , where the torques become so strong as to truncate the flow .",
    "this is @xmath137 in the matching observation of xte  j1550 - 564 , so the inner flow in their picture is a narrow ring from @xmath138 ( ingram & done 2012 ) .",
    "this picture is somewhat different to that modelled above , where the hot flow which extends down to the isco but can be radiatively inefficient .",
    "it is not at all clear what should happen to the accretion torques in the inner part of a misaligned flow below the bending wave radius .",
    "there are additional stresses at the bending wave radius , and then below this the flow free streams into the black hole @xcite .",
    "thus it seems possible that the stresses might be more like a stress - free inner boundary at the bending wave radius , or it may be that the additional stresses at the bending wave radius release all the remaining energy ( fragile , private communication ) .",

    "one of the scenarios to explain this inefficient inner flow is that a fraction of the accretion power is used instead to power the jet .",
    "the energy loss inferred from the central flow is of order the radiated luminosity .",
    "thus we need to determine the coronal power to better than a factor of 2 to constrain this energy loss .",
    "however , reflection can contribute to the hard x - rays with luminosity of the same order as the accretion power , so treating reflection correctly is important .",

    "we checked our results on the coupled disc - corona model with inefficient / efficient hot inner flow ( section 5.3 , 5.4 ) . in the case of the inefficient untruncated inner flow ( see section 5.3 and column ( 3 ) in table  [ tab : vhs ] ) , the radiative efficiency of the inner flow is found to be larger , but still significantly below unity , with @xmath147 with @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) under the similar disc - corona geometry with @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "similarly , in the case of the efficient truncated inner flow ( section 5.4 , column ( 4 ) in table  [ tab : vhs ] ) , the inner radius of the efficient hot inner flow is estimated to be @xmath152 with @xmath153 ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "the larger radiated power required by removing reflection means that @xmath9 becomes smaller , but it is still strongly required to be truncated . thus even allowing no contribution from reflection ,",
    "the radiated power inferred is still significantly less than that required by the nt emissivity .",
    "conversely , the maximum reflection will give the minimum radiated power , and hence the maximum decrease in efficiency from nt .",
    "we neglected reflection from the overlap coupled disc - corona region which is acceptable only if the reflector has such high ionisation parameter that it is completely reflective ( as assumed ) or that the optical depth of the corona is large .",
    "given that the optical depth of our corona is not large , at @xmath155 ( see column ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) in table  [ tab : vhs ] ) , we explore whether we can increase the contribution of reflection by incorporating reflection from the coupled disc - corona region .",
    "hence we refit the data based on the model described in section 5.3 and 5.4 by changing the inner radius of the smeared reflection from @xmath156 to @xmath12 .",
    "slightly worse fits are obtained as @xmath157 and @xmath158 for the inefficient and efficient inner flow , respectively .",
    "however , the values of the efficiency and the truncated radius are obtained as @xmath159 and @xmath160 , respectively , the values which are the same as previous fits within 90% uncertainties ( see column ( 3)(4 ) in table  [ tab : vhs ] ) .",
    "fitting physical models for the complex spectra seen in the vhs offers new insight into the properties of this complex state . our model offers two main improvements on earlier attempts : firstly it models the comptonised emission with the eqpair code , which self consistently calculates the electron distribution from non - thermal acceleration .",
    "this is not a power law , as assumed in simpl comptonisation , but is hybrid as the low energy electrons thermalise by coulomb rather than compton cooling .",
    "this has a profound impact on the derived reflection parameters . rather than requiring that the source be reflection dominated , and that the reflection is strongly smeared",
    ", the eqpair models ( which fit the data better than the simpl models ) have @xmath161 and only moderate smearing which does not constrain black hole spin .",
    "we caution that spin determinations from reflection parameters are not always robust to changes in the continuum model .",
    "the second improvement in our code is that it specifically sets the available energy in terms of the physical black hole parameters , assuming a novikov - thorne emissivity .",
    "this is clearly appropriate for the high / soft state taken a few days after our vhs observation .",
    "a comparison of these two spectra using the same physical black hole parameters is especially compelling as they have similar luminosities .",
    "the high / soft state is disc dominated , so the emissivity is dissipated as ( colour temperature corrected ) blackbody emission at each radius .",
    "a blackbody is the most efficient radiator so a spectrum with the same luminosity can not have a mean photon energy which is lower than this .",
    "since the vhs spectrum is steep , this means that the similar luminosity vhs spectrum can not peak at a lower energy if the dissipation as a function of radius remains unaltered . the observed drop in energy at which",
    "the vhs spectrum peaks compared that of the thermal high / soft state at a similar luminosity then clearly shows that the energy dissipated in the accretion flow as a function of radius has changed dramatically from that of novikov - thorne . simply growing a corona , even one",
    "whose energy and seed photons are coupled to the underlying disc emission , will produce a spectrum which peaks at higher energy than that of the multi - blackbody disc seen in the high / soft state . even making a transition from the coupled disc - corona to a hot inner flow",
    "still can not fit the data unless the dissipation changes , fundamentally because a blackbody is the most efficient radiator , so any other radiation mechanism will only increase the peak spectral energy for the same luminosity .",
    "there are three possible ways to match what is observed .",
    "firstly the total dissipation could still be novikov - thorne if most of the power released in the innermost radii does not go to heating the accretion flow but is instead dark , e.g. lost as kinetic energy in a jet / wind .",
    "secondly , the dissipation could be changed from novikov - thorne in the inner regions e.g. if the flow is misaligned and truncation at the bending wave radius sets an effective stress - free inner boundary to the flow at @xmath139 .",
    "both these require that the radiated efficiency has dropped compared to novikov - thorne , so the same luminosity as the high / soft state can only be produced with a higher mass accretion rate through the outer ( standard ) disc .",
    "the third possibility is that the flow is not in steady state , so that the mass accretion rate in outer disc is larger than that in the inner disc .",
    "we discuss each of these in turn below .",
    "the most obvious solution to the observed discrepancy in luminosity between the inner and outer flow is that the additional power is lost up the jet .",
    "the kinetic power of the jet is poorly constrained , but may be of order the accretion power ( fender et al .",
    "this would imply that the jet is accretion powered , rather than tapping the spin energy of the black hole ( blandford - znajek ) .",
    "the source here is still showing type c qpos , so has not made a hims / sims transition which is ( loosely ) associated with the collapse of the radio jet , so on timing signatures alone the source could still be powering a steady , compact jet . however , there are simultaneous radio observations which show that the jet is already strongly suppressed by this point ( corbel : private communication ) .",
    "the 39  kev observed x - ray flux of @xmath162 predicts a 9  ghz radio flux of 15  mjy from the fundamental plane @xcite . removing the disc component",
    "so as to include only the comptonised power still gives a 39  kev flux of @xmath163 , so this does not make a significant difference to the predicted radio flux .",
    "yet the observed 9  ghz flux on 15th february ( simultaneous with the end of the suzaku observation ) is 1.4  mjy ( corbel , private communication ) , so it appears that the radio is already strongly suppressed below the fundamental plane at this point .",
    "thus our missing luminosity is not powering the steady , compact jet .",
    "we note that a similar drop in radio without being accompanied by any change in x - ray variability power and qpo type is also seen in maxi  j@xmath3@xcite .    instead",
    ", the timing transition may be associated with the launching of the discrete ejection events @xcite , which gives another potential energy / mass loss process .",
    "however , our vhs observation is still in the hard intermediate state , with strong x - ray variability and type c qpo .",
    "the transition to the sims happens up to a day after our vhs observation @xcite , and indeed , the radio data just before and just after the high / soft state on the 19th february show an optically thin radio flare ( 16 and 12  mjy at 9  ghz on 18 and 20th february ) .",
    "thus if the hims / sims transition marks the ejection , our data are not losing energy via this route as the transition has not yet taken place .",
    "however , we note that radio behaviour around the transition is complex , and that there are time lags between various components of the jet which can make it difficult to establish causal connections ( corbel et al 2013a ; miller - jones et al 2012 ; curran et al 2015 ; brocksopp et al 2013 ; miller - jones et al 2012 ; hannikainen et al 2009 ) .",
    "nonetheless , it seems that the power is not being dissipated in a steady jet , nor in a discrete ejection .",
    "our suzaku data are taken over a timescale of 3 days without much change in spectral or timing properties ( t12 ; motta et al 2011 ) , so it seems unlikely that there was a missed transition and then recovery back to the hard intermediate state .",
    "there do not appear to be any other obvious energy loss channels .",
    "the inferred mass accretion rate ( modulo the uncertainties in system parameters ) does not seem to be at or above eddington , so optically thick advection ( abramowicz et al 1989 ) , or mass loss through radiatively driven winds ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) are not likely to make much of a difference to the radiated power , though magnetic winds from the inner disc are always a possibility . conversely , the system luminosity is high enough that substantial losses through optically thin advection are not likely either ( narayan & yi 1996 ; yuan et al 2004 ) .",
    "thus a magnetically driven outflow / jet appears to be the only candidate , and this needs to carry away around as much energy as is radiated .",
    "the novikov - thorne emissivity is specifically derived for a thin disc , where the stresses which give rise to viscosity are in a plane .",
    "a geometrically thick flow can have very different stresses e.g. a large scale height flow can have magnetic connections across the horizon , so the stress - free inner boundary condition is no longer appropriate @xcite .",
    "however , this leads to additional dissipation , rather than to less dissipation , as required here .",
    "our preferred flow model is complex , with a thin disc , transitioning to a coupled disc - corona region .",
    "the thin disc then disappears completely in the inner region , leaving only corona plasma between @xmath39 and @xmath139 .",
    "it is not at all clear what happens to the dissipation at the edge of the thin disc @xmath39 .",
    "the hotter plasma may support stresses like the novikov - thorne stresses across the boundary between them , or it may be rarified enough that a stress - free inner boundary condition at the truncation radius is more appropriate . in the latter case ,",
    "the accretion power on the inner edge of the disc - corona and the outer part of the hot flow is lower than expected from novikov - thorne , though this might not be a large enough effect to produce the required marked deficit in power .    instead , the mismatch between mass accretion rate and luminosity in the inner flow could be produced in the three zone models as an additional signature of a lense - thirring origin of the qpo . a flow which is misaligned to the black hole spin experiences a torque , which propagates at the local sound speed .",
    "a thin disc is cool , so the bending waves can not propagate fast enough to make the disc precess , so it forms a stable warp ( bardeen - petterson ) .",
    "conversely , for a thick disc , the hotter material means a faster sound speed , so the torque can communicate across the flow on timescales fast enough for it to precess as a solid body ( fragile et al 2007 ; ingram et al 2009 ) .",
    "the misalignment torques are so strong at small radii that they effectively truncate the flow at a bending wave radius , of order 812@xmath128 ( fragile et al 2007 ; 2009 ; ingram et al 2009 ; dexter & fragile 2011 ; ingram & done 2012 ) .",
    "the accretion flow is laminar rather than turbulent after this point , so it may lead to an effective stress ",
    "free inner boundary condition at a radius larger than @xmath25 , giving less accretion power .",
    "however , the torques could also simply transfer the accretion power from below to above the bending wave radius , so that the total dissipation in the flow remained similar to that expected from novikov - thorne ( fragile , private communication ) .",
    "the two possibilities discussed above both require that the overall efficiency is lower than novikov - thorne .",
    "fundamentally this conclusion is driven by the observation that the vhs spectrum peaks at lower energy than that seen in the similar luminosity high / soft state . the observed continuum below 1",
    "kev is sensitive to the mass accretion rate through the outer ( standard disc ) .",
    "the novikov - thorne emissivity should be appropriate here , yet fits constrain the mass accretion rate through the outer disc to be @xmath164 higher than that required to power the high / soft state ( see tables  [ tab : hs ] and [ tab : vhs ] ) .",
    "since the observed luminosity of the vhs is only @xmath165 that of the high / soft state , then this requires that the radiative efficiency is lower in the inner disc",
    ".    however , a decreasing mass accretion rate from the vhs to the high / soft state while the bolometric luminosity stays almost the same appears somewhat fine - tuned . instead",
    ", since our data are taken on the fast rise to outburst , the flow could simply be out of steady state , while novikov - thorne explicitly assumes constant @xmath166 at all radii .",
    "simulations of the viscous evolution of the disc during an outburst show that the surface density takes days to settle into this configuration after the the hydrogen ionisation instability is triggered at large radii @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , our vhs data are taken over a 3 day time period with little evolution in spectra or timing properties , so it seems more likely that the flow is in some sort of steady state .",
    "the vhs is a rather rare spectral state .",
    "more observations would clearly show whether the difference in emissivity seen here is only associated with fast changes in mass accretion rate , as is required in section 6.4 .",
    "similarly , more simultaneous radio observations would tie down the associated jet and/or plasma ejections required in section 6.2 , though the magnetic wind is much harder to constrain .",
    "a stress - free inner boundary due to bending wave radius from a misaligned precessing hot flow ( section 6.3 ) should also be present in any qpo observation of the low / hard state .",
    "comptonisation in the vhs is complex , with a high energy tail pointing to the importance of non - thermal electrons .",
    "however , purely non - thermal acceleration does not result in a purely power law electron distribution when both compton and coulomb collisions are included .",
    "the self - consistent ( pure power law acceleration balancing cooling ) steady state electron distribution is thermal at low energies , resulting in a compton continuum with complex curvature , as calculated in the eqpair code by coppi .",
    "this completely removes the requirement for high black hole spin and high reflected fraction in the suzaku vhs data .",
    "we develop a new model for the accretion flow , diskeq which tracks energy across the flow but allows this to be dissipated either in a standard disc , or in a coupled disc - corona geometry where the comptonisation is based on the eqpair code or in a hot inner flow , where again the comptonisation is described by eqpair . using this",
    ", we demonstrate for the first time that the vhs is not well described by novikov - thorne emissivity . the spectrum below 1  kev constrains the outer ( standard ) disc emission , requiring a mass accretion rate which is @xmath167 higher than that seen in a disc dominated high / soft state , but the total vhs spectrum is only a factor @xmath168 brighter .",
    "the most obvious solution is that the excess novikov - thorne emissivity in the inner disc is not translated into radiation , but is instead used to power of the jet .",
    "however , simultaneous observations show that the radio is strongly suppressed . instead",
    ", it could show that the novikov - thorne prescription is not appropriate , perhaps due to the flow being misaligned as required to produce the qpo from lense - thirring precession .",
    "we urge the use of more physical models to fit the complex intermediate states in order to distinguish between these possibilities , and are releasing the code within the xspec spectral fitting package to enable this .",
    "we allow the distance @xmath169 to be an additional free parameter in order for it to act as a proxy for the truncation radius of a flow / disc with stress free inner boundary at @xmath170 , for the fixed spin parameter @xmath113 .",
    "the scaling factor in table  [ tab : vhs ] is defined as @xmath171 , and the proper radii are approximately estimated by multiplying the scaling factor to the derived radii with diskeq .",
    "the ratio @xmath173 is the major parameter determines the spectral shape from comptonisation . in the overlap region ,",
    "reflection and reprocessing mean that this is not simply related to the fraction @xmath26 of the intrinsic power which is dissipated in the corona . at the disc surface ,",
    "the outgoing flux @xmath174 is the sum of the intrinsic disc dissipation , @xmath175 , and the reflected / reprocessed response of the disc to the irradiating flux from the corona , @xmath176 , and reflected component , @xmath177 . hence @xmath178 as the total soft flux is the sum of the seed and reprocessed emission . by using disc irradiation from the corona , @xmath179 ,",
    "@xmath177 can be written as @xmath180 for an albedo @xmath181 , and @xmath179 is the sum of downwards flux from intrinsic dissipation , plus the energy of the seed photons backscattered from the disc . hence , considering the fraction of disc and reflection luminosity scattered in the corona , @xmath182 , the irradiation from the corona is written as following .",
    "@xmath183 recasting this as an explicit equation gives @xmath184 defining @xmath185 , similar to the equation @xmath186 for the intrinsic dissipation . since @xmath187 then @xmath188 . substituting from above for @xmath189 gives @xmath190 ( j. malzac , private communication ) .",
    "the power emitted from the top of the corona , @xmath191 , is now the sum of the coronal power plus the seed photons travelling upwards , @xmath192 , together with the disc emission crossing the corona without any interaction , @xmath193 .",
    "the total disc emission is caused by internal dissipation and irradiation so @xmath194 .",
    "substituting for @xmath179 from above gives @xmath195 so that @xmath196 .",
    "hence energy is still conserved in this region , as assumed in the code ( j. malzac , private communication ) . however",
    ", our code does not explicitly distinguish the internally reflected emission , @xmath197 , from @xmath198 , and we caution that full radiative transfer is probably required in this region",
