    "in this paper , i demonstrate a local resolution to the problem of time ( pot ) @xcite that is machian in character @xcite .",
    "see sec 2 for explanations of the facets that constitute the pot facets , strategies resolving them , and for the precise meaning given here to the terms ` machian ' and ` a local resolution ' to be clear , this resolution applies in semiclassical regimes . whilst this is a theoretical limitation ,",
    "the semiclassical quantum cosmology regime is of more immediate observational relevance than more fully quantum regimes .",
    "i previously demonstrated such a machian local resolution of the pot for relational particle models ( rpm s ) @xcite .",
    "the minisuperspace @xcite ( alias homogeneous gr ) case is in many ways more straightforward ( no nontrivial linear constraints ) .",
    "it is relevant both as an approximate model for our universe and as the zeroth order of more accurate such models along the lines of halliwell  hawking @xcite .",
    "the latter are the next step in the present program ; the extent to which our local resolution to the pot extends to this is the subject of work in progress ( see the conclusion for more ) .",
    "the halliwell  hawking model is of inhomogeneous perturbations about homogeneous cosmology .",
    "it is already a realistic model for the possible quantum - cosmological origin of large - scale structures such as galaxies and cmb hot - spots ( via amplification by some inflationary mechanism @xcite ) .",
    "this model is like rpm s in possessing nontrivial linear constraints , albeit now with further nontrivial diffeomorphism connotations .",
    "additionally in both cases the linear constraints are algebraically solvable @xcite . thus working with a model along the lines of halliwell  hawking s",
    "@xcite is jointly the natural successor of the present paper s minisuperspace work and previous papers rpm work .",
    "i am drawn to working with specifically the spatially-@xmath0 friedmann  lematre  robertson  walker ( flrw ) cosmology by the following .",
    "i ) a combination of machian considerations and simplicity .",
    "ii ) i am moving toward working with a model along the lines of halliwell  hawking s more realistically cosmological model .",
    "additionally i am drawn to include scalar field matter in this work by the following .",
    "a ) standard practise in cosmology .",
    "b ) the specifics of the halliwell  hawking model .",
    "c ) that models with one degree of freedom are relationally trivial ( see also sec 2 for what i mean by ` relational ' in this paper . ) a cosmological constant term is needed to support the spatially-@xmath0 flrw cosmology with scalar field matter in the case in which matter effects are presumed small @xcite .",
    "there are then two different sets of modelling assumptions to consider .",
    "1 ) the matter physics is light and fast ( l ) as compared to the gravitational physics being heavy and slow ( h : not to be confused with the spatial 3-metric @xmath1 ) .",
    "2 ) both are h and only further entities introduced in further papers ( anisotropy in @xcite or inhomogeneity in @xcite ) are l. this use of h and l terminology is standard in semiclassical approaches , as detailed in sec 3 .",
    "secs 2 and 3 explain pot facets alongside their machian resolution , using the isotropic minisuperspace model as an example in each case .",
    "with justification of the semiclassical approach s crucial wkb ansatz and approximation being tenuous , sec 3 considers the combined machian semiclassical  histories  records scheme .",
    "this rests on i ) a small expansion upon anastopoulos and savvidou s work @xcite on histories theory for isotropic minisuperspace with scalar field .",
    "ii ) halliwell s work @xcite on not explicitly machian versions of such combinations .",
    "i conclude in sec 4",
    ". a further paper will contain detailed perturbative equations both for this paper s case and for the more complicated and generic case of bianchi ix minisuperspace too @xcite .",
    "temporal relationalism is the leibnizian idea that ` there is no time for the universe as a whole ' @xcite .",
    "this is desirable as regards background independence and the modelling of closed universes .",
    "the well - known quantum - level frozen formalism problem facet of the problem of time  that gr s quantum wave equation is timeless  then turns out to be a _ consequence _ of temporal relationalism , as we shall see below .",
    "moreover , the rest of this ssec makes it clear that temporal relationalism is already present at the classical level ; this rather less well - known point is in fact the essential content of barbour s @xcite .",
    "note that in the temporal relationalism idea , no details of what is meant by ` universe ' are required other than it being a whole system rather than a subsystem .",
    "( thus how our conception of universe has changed since leibniz s day due to gr and modern observational cosmology does not affect use of this idea . )",
    "the precise meaning of temporal relationalism comes , rather , from adopting the following sharp mathematical implementation .",
    "\\1 ) the action is not to contain any extraneous time or time - like variables .",
    "\\2 ) the action is to be reparametrization - invariant .",
    "the usual role of time in actions has been replaced by a mere label time that is physically meaningless ; this is the parameter in question .",
    "it then makes more sense for primary - level conceptualization to not be centred about physically meaningless entities .",
    "so instead of writing the action in terms of a meaningless parameter , one writes it down without resorting to making a parametrization , i.e. a parametrization - irrelevant action . finally , it is still better not to name such an action after an absent irrelevant entity , and one can do so because the actions in question happen to be , dually , geometrical arc elements .",
    "thus what i actually postulate is a geometrical arc element action ( of the jacobi  synge type as detailed in the next paragraph ) .",
    "this then implies , dually , parametrization - irrelevance , which in turn implies reparametrization - invariance upon introduction of a parameter .",
    "this parameter is then identified as a label - time that has supplanted the primary - level role played by absolute time in non - relational physics , so that the stated postulate indeed succeeds in making contact with a change in how time is modelled in physical theories .",
    "example 1 ) the jacobi action for the mechanics of configurations @xmath2 ( e.g. positions of @xmath3 particles ) is @xmath4 = 2 : = 2 .",
    "[ s - jac ] the first form is in terms of the physical line element @xmath5 , and obviously constitutes a _",
    "geodesic principle_. the second form is in terms of the kinetic line element @xmath6 , which is conformally - related to the preceding by a conformal factor @xmath7 .",
    "thus this is a geodesic principle up to a conformal factor , which is termed a parageodesic principle .",
    "the third form defines @xmath6 ; @xmath8 is the kinetic metric .",
    "the fourth form then demonstrate the insertion of a parameter by which the first form is parametrization - irrelevant and the second form is reparametrization - invariant .",
    "the fifth form recasts the arc element as a kinetic energy term whose velocities are held to be more primary than these velocities through not involving the label time . ]",
    "are built out of label - time derivatives , producing a form more familiar to some readers .",
    "thus it is clear that the jacobi action corresponds to theories whose kinetic terms are purely quadratic in their velocities .",
    "example 2 ) synge subsequently considered more general geometrical arc elements that are not subjected to this purely quadratic restriction @xcite .",
    "example 3 ) full gr with a minimally - coupled scalar field then has a similar relational action ( along the lines of @xcite ) is taken to be compact without boundary .",
    "this is to avoid undue influence of boundary or asymptotic physics , and is a criterion also argued for by einstein .",
    "it is also a simpler case to handle mathematically .",

    "the appearance of the quantum - level frozen formalism problem .",
    "moreover , the above timelessness at the primary level can in the classical case be resolved at a secondary , emergent level by _",
    "mach s time principle _ : ` time is to be abstracted from change ' .",
    "three distinct specifications of which involve ` any change ' ( rovelli @xcite ) , ` all change ' ( barbour @xcite ) and my ` sufficient totality of locally relevant change ' ( stlrc ) @xcite .",
    "this emergent time represents a local generalization of the astronomers ephemeris time @xcite ; this is particularly manifest in the case of mechanics . to fulfil the true content of the stlrc approach",
    ", all change is given opportunity to contribute to the timestandard .",
    "however only changes that do so in practise to within the desired accuracy are actually kept .",
    "all three of these specifications have some sense in which they are ` democratic ' . the senses in which ` any change ' and ` all change ' are democratic are clear . for stlrc ,",
    "the democracy is in all change having _ the opportunity _ to contribute .",
    "however , then only those changes whose contributions lead to effects above the desired accuracy are actually kept in practise . additionally , only ` all change ' and stlrc take into consideration that ` some clocks / timestandards are better than others ' is an essential part of accurate timekeeping .",
    "( @xcite explains how sidereal time gives more accurate predictions than ( apparent ) solar time as an example of this . ) finally , only ` any change ' and stlrc are operationally realizable .",
    "[ ` all change ' fails in this regard since some of the universe s contents are inaccurately or completely unknown , so one can not include ` all change ' in accurate practical calculations . ]",
    "thus overall , stlrc wins out .",
    "emergent jacobi time is an implementation of mach s time principle . at first sight",
    "it is an ` all change ' implementation , but , in practice it is a stlrc one ( for operational reasons : not all changes in the universe are kept in practise in forming the expression for @xmath28 ) . for isotropic minisuperspace , this emergent time takes the form ^ ( ) = s/ . .",
    "[ plain - tem ] the oversized notation @xmath29 is used to incorporate selection of ` calendar year zero ' , @xmath30 . from inspecting how this timestandard features in the equations of motion of the system , it represents a relational recovery of the well - known notion of cosmic time .",
    "thus the current machian time program specifically selects cosmic time as the timestandard to use in classical cosmology .",
    "moreover it provides a formula for it which , at least in detail , has further dependence on anisotropies and inhomogeneities . [ at this point in the argument , the mechanics counterpart amounts to a relational recovery of newtonian absolute time , whilst in the more general gr context picks up the local proper time . ]",
    "we make an h ",
    "l split is between heavy degrees of freedom and light degrees of freedom .",
    "this is a classical parallel of 1 ) the procedure in molecular physics by which one solves for the electronic structure under the approximation that the much heavier nuclei stay fixed .",
    "2 ) a technically similar approximation procedure from semiclassical quantum cosmology .",
    "the new idea is that the h degrees of freedom provide an approximate timestandard with respect to which the l degrees of freedom evolve .",
    "here the relational action is s_^ = ( 3 ) . we have used here the approximations @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "i.e. the scale contributions to the change / kinetic term and to the potential term dominate over the matter scalar field contributions to each of these respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint is then ^ : = - ( -3 ) _",
    "^2 + ( 3)\\{2- ( -2 ) } = 0 .",
    "the emergent jacobi time is ^()_(0 ) = / = 2 ^ -1/2 ( ) . however , pure - h expressions of this general form  @xmath33 $ ]  are unsatisfactory from a machian perspective since they do not give l - change an opportunity to contribute .",
    "this deficiency is to be resolved by treating them as zeroth - order approximations in an expansion involving the l - physics too . expanding ( [ plain - tem ] ) ,",
    "one obtains a novel expression of the bona fide machian form @xmath34 $ ] : ^()_(1 ) = ^()_(0 ) + \\ { v ( ) - \\ { } ^2 } + o(\\{}^4 ) + o(\\{}^2 ) .",
    "[ cl - expansion ] here the leading corrections are , firstly a @xmath17-potential term , the integral in the expression of which comes out as -1/2 + \\{1/2 } ( ) / , secondly , there is also an l - change term that renders the scheme machian in the above sense .",
    "a more full analysis involves expanding h , l , @xmath28 as functions of an n - tuple of small ` @xmath35 ' quantities .",
    "see @xcite for this in full ( or @xcite for the already - available rpm counterpart ) , but in outline these small quantities are l - to - h kinetic term ratios and potential term ratios , interaction term to h ratio and ratios of derivatives of such terms .",
    "a key feature here is that what is conventionally an ` independent variable ' @xmath36 , is here a @xmath28 that is a priori a _",
    "highly - dependent _ variable .",
    "as such it is clear that this itself is to be subjected to perturbations , whereas the conventional ` independent variable ' use of @xmath36 itself is not .",
    "see @xcite for details of the equations that this produces in this minisuperspace case .    by the problem of time ,",
    "however , i do not merely mean the frozen formalism problem , but rather the totality of qm  gr incompatibilities for which and isham list the frozen formalism problem as but one of eight facets .",
    "the remaining facets are outlined below .      in the context of gr ,",
    "the second pot facet is most usually termed the thin sandwich problem @xcite .",
    "the sandwich name is specific to gr as geometrodynamics [ see fig 1 a ) and b ) ] .",
    "the thin sandwich problem consists of solving the lagrangian variables ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) form of the gr momentum constraint for the 3-diffeomorphism auxiliary variable ( usually the shift ) .",
    "however , in the case of an arbitrary physical theory , the thin sandwich problem is generalized by barbour s best matching problem @xcite [ fig 1 c ) and d ) ] .",
    "this consists of solving the lagrangian variables form of those of the theory s first - class constraints that are linear in the momenta for the corresponding auxiliary variables .",
    "such theories have a group @xmath39 of continuous motions that are taken to be physically irrelevant ( this is what is meant by configurational relationalism ) . in best",
    "matching , then , the classical action is built to contains auxiliary variables corresponding to @xmath39 .",
    "these are then to be removed by i ) solving the constraints that arise from variation with respect to the @xmath39-auxiliaries ( which are the aforementioned linear constraints ) for the @xmath39-auxiliaries themselves .",
    "ii ) one then substitutes these solutions back into the action itself to obtain an action that is @xmath39-invariant directly ( i.e. without involving any @xmath39-auxiliaries ) .",
    "note that to render best matching compatible with temporal relationalism @xcite , multiplier coordinate auxiliaries such as the shift to be replaced by cyclic differentials ( as in cyclic velocities with @xmath40 s deleted from their denominators ) .",
    "one then also has to consider the constraints in ` jacobian ' ( @xmath37 , @xmath41 ) variables rather than lagrangian ones .",
    "configurational relationalism usually interferes with the frozen formalism problem since it needs to be tackled prior to it for the above resolution s machian emergent time to be free of reference to the @xmath39-auxiliaries .",
    "this is manifest in the next formula below . since it is in this context that barbour ",
    "bertotti s work @xcite is further necessary , i denote this timefunction by @xmath42 .",
    "e.g. for gr , @xmath39 = diff(@xmath9 )  the 3-diffeomorphisms of the constant - topology spatial manifold  as encoded by the auxiliary ` frame variable ' @xmath18 in ( [ s - jac ] ) .",
    "then @xmath18 then enters the expression for the emergent time , from where it has to be cancelled out with the following extremization : ^ ( ) = ( .||_f(h , ) ||_/ ) .",
    "thus such expressions are only explicit if one succeeds in solving the linear @xmath39-constraints for the auxiliary @xmath39-auxiliaries themselves .",
    "let us comment further on the form of this expression .",
    "it says that one has to extremize _ one _ functional in order to use the extremal value from that in a _",
    "second _ functional .",
    "this is more complicated than the usual variational problem that involves extremizing a single functional .",
    "one might wonder what happens if one simply extremizes the time functional itself .",
    "in simple examples such as relational mechanics , this makes no difference @xcite , but in the general case it produces an answer that a ) different and b ) inconsistent with the outcome of reordering the reducing and time - forming maps .",
    "the presently given 2-functional extremization , on the other hand , is compatible with such reorderings of the maps involved @xcite .    finally , best matching generalizes further in the map - ordering sense to configurational relationalism . by ` map - ordering sense ' ,",
    "i mean that the reduction can be performed at _ any _ level ( e.g. hamiltonian or quantum - mechanical ) rather than just specifically a lagrangian- or jacobian - level reduction as just described .",
    "on the one hand , it should be said that the present paper s minisuperspace model straightforwardly avoids configurational relationalism by its assumption of homogeneity . on the other hand ,",
    "the present program s pot resolving strategy has the virtue of succeeding in dealing with configurational relationalism . in particular",
    ", this facet is both present and resolvable for the more realistic and hence important halliwell  hawking model that is the objective of the _ next _ papers of this program .      the word ` relational ' is used rather differently by e.g. barbour , gryb and i @xcite on the one hand , and by e.g. crane and rovelli @xcite on the other hand .",
    "there are further distinctions within each of these two groupings ( see figure [ bacr ] ) .",
    "a third pot facet is the problem of beables .",
    "observables , or beables  following john bell @xcite : a more cosmologically and quantum - mechanically appropriate notion than observables  are hard to come by in classical and quantum gr .",
    "models with trivial configurational relationalism ( or resolved best matching ) readily possess an explicit full set of classical _",
    "beables_. i.e. quantities that poisson - brackets - commute with the classical linear constraints . for the present paper , these are .",
    "i.e. the beables are functionals of the scale variable , the scalar matter field and the conjugate momenta of each . in the case of trivial configurational relationalism ,",
    "halliwell furthermore provided @xcite a prescription for dirac beables  commuting with the quadratic constraint also  which i promoted to the case of models with resolved best matching too @xcite .",
    "the other three facets to overcome in order to have a local resolution of the pot are as follows .",
    "a fourth facet is the constraint closure problem : that the quadratic constraint following from temporal relationalism and the linear constraints following from configurational relationalism are all the constraints .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the dirac procedure @xcite gives back further constraints , including the possibility of inconsistency .",
    "a fifth facet is the foliation dependence problem : such dependence would be regarded as contrary to gr s capacity to include the perspectives of all observers .",
    "a sixth facet is the spacetime reconstruction problem .",
    "this is from the assumption of just space or from dropping the assumption of the continuum .",
    "it has further quantum - level motivation @xcite , from configurations fluctuating quantum - mechanically and deformed geometries generally not all being embeddable within a common spacetime .",
    "see @xcite for a more full account of these three facets . in any case , at the classical level , these three facets are avoided for full gr .",
    "this is by three results about the algebraic structure of the constraints ( see @xcite for details and @xcite for the original references ) . in particular ,",
    "the dirac algebroid of the gr constraints closes and foliation dependence is resolved by demonstrating refoliation invariance [ figure 1d ) ] .",
    "however , for minisuperspace in general , there is a simpler triple of results resolution based on homogeneity @xcite .",
    "homogeneity implies no momentum constraint , so the hamiltonian constraint stands alone , giving closure .",
    "homogeneity implies a foliation privileged by the surfaces of homogeneity , and the spacetime to be reconstructed in this case is simpler due to this structure too .",
    "the bracket of two hamiltonian constraints has a momentum constraint - factor that is zero by homogeneity , thus one has a bona fide algebra of constraints ( rather than the constraint algebroid of full gr ) .",
    "furthermore , the obstruction term to classical spacetime reconstruction @xcite contains a spatial derivative factor , so it is also trivial for homogeneous models .",
    "[ the fourth to sixth facets are mostly mentioned due to their nontrivial nature in applying the present program to the halliwell  hawking model . ]",
    "i next explain what i mean in this article by ` a local ' resolution of the pot .",
    "the pot is taken to have 8 facets . `",
    "a local ' is then a conceptually well - defined subset of six of these , i.e. to the exclusion of the multiple choice problem facet by use of ` a ' , and of the global pot facet by use of ` local ' .",
    "the multiple choice problem is a purely quantum - mechanical problem following from classical equivalence under canonical transformations in general not implying quantum - mechanical equivalence under unitary transformations .",
    "[ i take ` multiple choice problem ' in the specific sense of kucha and isham @xcite ; this means from a technical perspective that it is chiefly based on the groenewold ",
    "van hove phenomenon @xcite . ]",
    "consequently a single classical theory can lead to multiple inequivalent quantum theories .",
    "this is a time issue through different classical choices of time variables being capable of leading to quantum inequivalence , and also via this problem occurring in one s choice of beables / observables .",
    "the global pot itself has many subfacets .",
    "it can refer to both non - globality over space or in one s notion of time itself .",
    "also it can refer to the difference between infinitesimal and extended regions , or to topological effects . in the pot context , whichever of these types of globality can apply to timefunctions , frames , foliations , transformations , validity of solutions of equations , beables / observables and more . a detailed treatment of global issues and their classification would be an article - length account itself , and is indeed one i am preparing to write an article on in 2014 .",
    "a few pertinent comments as regards this paper s model are that the action and the emergent time notions are in general only intended to hold locally , as are the h - l split and the notions of beables employed . some of these issues can be furtherly subjected to ` patching together ' of regions ( a concept more fully laid out in e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "finally , note that this use of ` local ' in the present paper is not to be confused with ` local degrees of freedom ' in the field - theoretic sense , since in particular minisuperspace models do not possess any such .",
    "kinematical quantization for this system involves what is to be expected for a system whose isometry group is the 2-@xmath22 poincar group .",
    "i.e. a boost @xmath43 and a 2-vector @xmath44 = ( @xmath45 ) that form this isometry group and another 2-vector @xmath46 upon which this group acts .",
    "this is the indefinite counterpart of the familiar heisenberg group ( here 2-@xmath22 ) .",
    "dynamical quantization is based on the relationally - motivated @xcite conformal ordering @xcite .",
    "moreover , either the 2-@xmath22ness or the flatness of the configuration space suffices to ensure that the conformal ordering is equal to the laplacian ordering .",
    "thus the wave equation is the toy model wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation of the form ^2 _",
    "2:= ^2_^2= ^2\\{_^2 - ^2_}= ( 6)\\{(-2 ) - 2- v ( ) } .",
    "this is elementary to solve for @xmath47 , and then one can treat exp@xmath48 as an interaction term to which one can apply a standard form of time - independent perturbation theory .",
    "moreover , frozen formalism problem resolutions by @xmath28 fails at the quantum level since the quantum wave equation remains in the form @xmath49 .",
    "my answer to that is to machianize semiclassical approach .",
    "the timestandard this produces is indeed similar to @xmath28 from a machian perspective .",
    "furthermore these two timestandards are indeed expected to differ on machian grounds also , as explained in the next ssec .      here",
    "@xcite one again has a h ",
    "moreover now the h carry additional connotation of ` slow ' to l s ` fast ' due to the double nature of the wavefunction ansatz and associated approximations in use .",

    "the semiclassical correction terms , however , are distinct from the classical ones ; both are machian and the difference between them is for machian reasons too : now it is _ quantum _ change that needs to be given the opportunity to contribute .",

    "back - reaction terms involving higher derivatives were kept in kiefer and singh @xcite , which work was more recently followed up by kiefer and kramer @xcite ; back - reaction terms were also considered in @xcite .",
    "diabatic terms were kept instead in work of massar and parentani @xcite .",
    "non - minimally coupled scalar fields were considered by the bologna group @xcite , who followed this up by considering a minimally - coupled scalar inflaton alongside a conformally - coupled scalar field @xcite .",
    "the above scalar field models were briefly reviewed in zeh s book @xcite and more extensively in kiefer s @xcite ; see also the recent @xcite for bo - approximated quantum gravity corrections to inflationary cosmology .",
    "ultimately , however , in cosmology one is more interested in modelling small anisotropies and even more so in modelling small inhomogeneities .",
    "semiclassical quantum cosmology with small anisotropies in the l - role were considered in vacuo by e.g. marolf @xcite ; @xcite will consider these in the presence of a scalar field also ( now treated as h jointly with the scalefactor ) .",
    "semiclassical quantum cosmology with small inhomogeneities is well - known to have started with halliwell and hawking s paper @xcite ; this was followed up by halliwell s paper on correlations @xcite and kiefer s on decoherence @xcite .    as regards emergent semiclassical time , this was first widely brought to attention by banks @xcite and halliwell  hawking @xcite , through it can be traced back to dewitt s much earlier work @xcite .",

    "@xcite s correlations exemplify a timeless approach . via decoherence in some such approaches @xcite one instead can take a histories - theoretic ( see sec 5 ) attitude to the issue of time in quantum cosmology .",
    "finally , the above three perspectives on time can be combined @xcite ( and sec 5 ) ; moreover this combination can continue to be considered from a machian perspective @xcite .",
    "next , note that a rectified time given by ( 3)/t^ ( ) = /t^ ( ) simplifies the l - equation to the _ emergent rectified - tdse _ i _",
    "^2 |+ v ( ) | .",
    "moreover , because the h and l equations for a coupled set of equations that in general have to be treated together as a system to solve for the unknowns @xmath57 and @xmath58 ,",

    "the zeroth approximation here coincides with the classical zeroth approximation , which was already declared to be non - machian .",
    "i then use the binomial expansion and expansion in powers of @xmath59 and of the number of qm averaged / expectation terms to isolate what will often serve as first correction terms : ^ ( ) ^()_(0 ) - - i + o(^2 , ^2 ) .",

    "the first of these contains an integral factor that can be evaluated without knowledge of the l - subsystem .",
    "this gives explicitly + ( ) . for computation of its co - factor , or the other term , we need to address the l - subsystem too .",
    "i then consider 1 ) the free approximation to the emergent rectified - tdse and 2 ) emergent rectified - time - dependent perturbations about this .",

    "@xcite in particular does so for this paper s minisuperspace example and its bianchi ix counterpart .",
    "the present paper s approach involves a complex notion of time .",
    "another approach that has recently given a complex notion of time is bojowald et al s approach @xcite .",
    "there is therefore some common interest in what a complex notion of time means conceptually , though in greater detail these two approaches are distinct .",
    "complex time can carry connotations of nonunitarity @xcite .",
    "@xcite s complex time is related to that approach s choice of inner product and time variable ; this also happens in the klein - gordon counterpart of this approach so it is not necessarily related to non - unitarity .",
    "however , in this case complex time does show up in tandem with non - unitarity of the dynamics setting in .",
    "on the other hand , in my approach to semiclassical models the complex time is tied to the approximate nature of the wave equations considered .",
    "this arises from the semiclassical h - equation being a quantum - corrected version of the quadratic constraint .",
    "then since quantum equations are in general complex , rearranging one to form a candidate timefunction is capable of producing a timefunction with complex corrections .",
    "more generally in semiclassical approaches , the presence of non - unitarity is not related to the semiclassical approximation itself , but rather to the choice of the time variable @xcite .",
    "n.b . that the working leading to such a tdwe ( time - dependent wave equation ) ceases to work in the absence of making the wkb ansatz and approximation . additionally , in quantum cosmology",
    ", this is not known to be a particularly strongly supported ansatz and approximation to make @xcite .",
    "this is crucial as regards the present article and program , since propping this up requires considering one or two further pot strategies from the classical level upwards .",
    "why is it not strongly supported in quantum cosmology ?",
    "firstly discount the applicability of the circumstances under which a wkb ansatz is used in ordinary qm .",
    "1 ) in ordinary qm , one often assumes @xcite the wkb ansatz as a consequence of the pre - existence of a surrounding classical large system , which is no longer applicable for the whole universe .",
    "2 ) in ordinary qm , the wkb ansatz can be justified by the lab set - up being a  pure incoming wave \" .",
    "but if one assumes a pure wave in the quantum cosmological context , its wavefronts orthogonally pick out a direction which serves as timefunction .",
    "thus this amounts to ` supposing time ' rather than a ` bona fide emergence of time ' as required to resolve the pot .    secondly , the wkb ansatz is not general or a priori natural .",
    "the @xmath50-function arises from solving an h - equation that is ( at least approximately ) a hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation .",
    "however , hamilton ",
    "jacobi equations have 2 solutions @xmath61 .",
    "thus in general one would expect not @xmath62",
    "= exp(i@xmath63 ) but @xcite a superposition @xmath64 moreover , the semiclassical approach s trick by which the chroniferous cross - term becomes the time - derivative part of a tdse is exclusive to wavefunctions obeying the wkb ansatz @xcite .",
    "possible ways out of this problem involve decoherence @xcite , perhaps from histories decohering , causing exp(i@xmath63 ) to emerge rather than the above more general superposition .",
    "thirdly , the sometimes also mentioned issue of whether exp(i@xmath63 ) is an appropriate solution to a real wave equation in place of a complex one is rendered less severe by the simple observation that real equations do however in general admit complex solutions .",
    "this does not however cover the deeper aspect unveiled by barbour @xcite : i.e. it is strange that a real wave equation which does not mix real and imaginary terms leads to a complex equation which does mix these .",
    "there is no configurational relationalism in the first place .",
    "quantum beables are trivial in the sense of being a subalgebra of the classical beables , but nontrivial as regards precisely what this choice entails . constraint closure , foliation - dependence and spacetime reconstruction remain protected at the quantum level by the model s homogeneity .",
    "the idea is to get round the wkb problem via combination with the histories and records approaches to the pot . for the present paper s model ,",
    "records approaches need none of the innovations of @xcite since minisuperspace fails to allow for localized structure .",
    "histories approaches require but a few departures from the perspective offered by anastopoulos and savvidou @xcite , as follows .",
    "their approach is a _ histories projection operator ( hpo ) _",
    "approach @xcite , applied indeed to the specific case of isotropic minisuperspace models with scalar field matter . to make contact with the present paper s work",
    ", one needs to specialize their work from flrw with general spatial curvature to flrw with positive spatial curvature and the usual compensating - sign @xmath16-term .",
    "one also needs to suppress their use of the lapse and its conjugate momentum in order to conform to our approach s temporal relationalism .",
    "these changes do not elsewise affect the classical and quantum histories brackets they consider .",
    "in general , the hpo kinematical quantization is notably different from sec 3 s since i ) the hpo approach involves continuous time @xcite .",
    "ii ) one then gets a 1-@xmath22 qft in the time direction .",
    "since this is relatively unfamiliar , i clarify it by saying that this has a nontrivial commutation relation not like the @xmath65 = i\\hbar \\delta_{ij}$ ] of finite qm but rather of the form @xmath66 = i\\hbar\\delta(t_1 - t_2)$ ] .",
    "i.e. a continuous dirac delta in place of a discrete kronecker delta , though moreover the former is better replaced by a smeared formulation . following isham and linden @xcite ,",
    "this involves the @xmath67 function space of real square - integrable functions on @xmath68 in the role of the test functions .",
    "then the nontrivial commutation relation becomes @xmath69 = i \\hbar\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}f(x)g(x)dx$ ] for @xmath70 .",
    "the ensuing quantum theory is then indeed based on a fock space as is habitual in qft ; see @xcite for more details .",
    "one can then additionally comply with temporal relationalism by formulating one s smearing functions to be parametrization - irrelevant in close parallel to @xcite .",
    "( i.e. let the smearing role conventionally played by arbitrary test functions @xmath71 be taken over by new smearing functions that are written in the temporal relationalism compatible form @xmath72 ) .    the combined machian ",
    "semiclassical  histories  records scheme is a particularly interesting prospect @xcite along the following lines ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "\\1 ) histories decohereing is a leading ( if not as yet fully established ) way by which a semiclassical regime s wkb approximation could be legitimately obtained in the first place . thus histories theory could support the semiclassical approach by freeing it of a major weakness .",
    "\\2 ) there is a records theory within histories theory , as pointed out by gell - mann and hartle @xcite and extended to imperfect cases by halliwell @xcite .",
    "thus histories theory supports records theory by providing guidance as to the form a working records theory would take .",
    "this also allows for these two to be jointly cast as a mathematically - coherent package .",
    "\\3 ) moreover , at the quantum level , in the words of gell - mann and hartle @xcite , .",
    "[ situ2 ] the elusive question of which degrees of freedom decohere which should then be answerable through where in the universe the information is actually stored , i.e. where the records thus formed are @xcite . in this way",
    ", records theory could in turn support histories theory .",
    "\\4 ) both histories and timeless approaches lie on the common ground of atemporal logic structures @xcite .",
    "\\5 ) by providing an underlying dynamics or history , the semiclassical approach and/or histories theory @xcite overcome present - day pure records theory s principal weakness of needing to find a practicable construction of a semblance of dynamics or history . such would go a long way towards records theory being complete .",
    "emergent semiclassical time amounts to an approximate semiclassical recovery of the emergent classical time @xcite , which is an encouraging result as regards making such a semiclassical  timeless records combination .",
    "\\6 ) the semiclassical approach aids in the computation of timeless probabilities of histories entering given configuration space regions ( see below for more ) .",
    "\\7 ) new to the present program , the semiclassical approach provides a machian scheme for classical and quantum records and histories to reside within .",

    "4 ) is much more trivial now too ( standard logic versus nontrivial topos - theoretic intuitionistic logic @xcite ) .    note",
    "2 ) i end by i logically ordering the interprotections between the three strategies .",
    "_ meaningless label _ histories come first , this gives the semiclassical approach and then this gives the emergent - time version of the histories approach .",
    "then localized timeless approaches sit inside the last two of these .",
    "the semiclassical approach sits inside the global timeless approach .",
    "but the global timeless approach can be taken to sit within global meaningless label time histories approach , so down both strands this is primary .",
    "the current paper s model is archetypal of halliwell s own examples @xcite of this combination , albeit additionally with a machian interpretation pinned upon it .",
    "this is by specifically using whichever suitable type of emergent time in the construction of the semiclassical expressions for the timeless probabilities .",
    "moreover , this paper s model s case of this construction has no need of the curved - geometry subtleties indicated in @xcite since this model possesses a flat presentation of configuration space .",
    "being indefinite , this is qualitatively distinguished from halliwell s absolute particle mechanics examples @xcite and my flat configuration space rpm examples @xcite . also , possessing no linear constraints , this model has no need to build and subsequently use nontrivial beables ( in this sense , the triangleland model in @xcite is more advanced .",

    "@xmath75 is the normal in configuration space .",
    "@xmath44 is a prefactor function , the detailed form of which is given in @xcite .",

    "p_r^ t^ ( ) _ r ( ) ^ w |()|^2 [ 36 ] obtained via the wigner function formulation and various semiclassical approximations . @xmath50 and @xmath77 here are as given in eq ( [ 2-ans ] ) . for instance",
    ", for @xmath78 , the approximately free case @xmath79 gives p_r^ _ 1 - with the last approximation holding for the case of @xmath80 small .",

    "these can be built in the sense of @xcite as well as in the above sense of @xcite ( the later of which have the advantage of not succumbing to a different kind of frozenness  the quantum zeno problem @xcite ) .",
    "i have shown that a local resolution of the problem of time ( pot ) that is machian for the closed spatially-@xmath0 isotropic minisuperspace gr model with single minimally - coupled scalar field matter can be constructed .",
    "this approach starts at the classical level with an emergent jacobi time .",
