    "as a leading candidate for new physics at the tev scale , supersymmetry ( susy ) is strongly motivated by solving the quadratic divergence of the standard model ( sm ) and the gauge hierarchy problem as well as by providing a dark matter candidate and a radiative electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism . compared with the situation before the start - up of the lhc , the discovery of a higgs boson @xcite and the significant constraints from the direct search of the lhc have driven a drastic paradigm shift in the landscape of low energy supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "we now know that the first two generation squarks must be heavier than 1.5 tev or higher , though it is too early to claim the death of low energy susy . it should be noted that the models with light third generation squarks and/or light gluino , such as the natural susy models @xcite , non - universal gaugino models @xcite , and compressed susy models @xcite , can still be consistent with experimental data .",
    "the higgs boson discovered by both the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations can impose significant constraint on some susy models .",
    "for example , the naive gmsb and amsb models may not produce a sm - like higgs boson with mass around 125 gev  @xcite unless stops are very heavy due to the small trilinear soft @xmath0 term ( for solutions , see refs .",
    "@xcite . ) .",
    "meanwhile , the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) or the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) model may be plagued with the fine - tuning issue in order to accommodate the higgs boson mass  @xcite via loop - induced contributions .",
    "the so - called fine - tuning issue can be greatly alleviated in the next - to mssm ( nmssm )  @xcite by utilizing both the tree - level free parameters and loop contributions  @xcite .",
    "in addition to alleviate the fine - tuning issue in the mssm , the nmssm is also well - motivated by solving the @xmath1-problem in mssm ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the singlino can ease the tension of experimental data and susy models ( see @xcite for more detailed discussion ) in dark matter search .",
    "the nmssm can be embedded into more fundamental theories , say the f - theory grand unified theories ( guts ) .",
    "the f - theory guts can induced unified boundary conditions to free parameters of the nmssm and yield interesting low energy phenomenologies , as explored in @xcite .",
    "the existence of an extra sm singlet in the nmssm can lead to a richer higgs phenomenology when compared with that of the mssm , there are three cp - even higgs bosons , and two cp - odd higgs bosons .",
    "it is noticed that both two light cp - even neutral higgs bosons ( labelled as @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively ) can be sm - like .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the nmssm can accommodate higgs boson data quite well if the higgs boson data observed by the atlas and cms collaborations were contributed by two degenerate higgs bosons which have mass around 126 gev .",
    "moreover , the nmssm has a better chance to interpret an extra 98 gev higgs boson or an extra 136 gev higgs boson hinted by the lep data @xcite or the tevatron data @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the parameter space of either @xmath2 or @xmath3 being sm - like is different from each other   might be the discovered higgs boson has been explored in refs .",
    "@xcite . ] , which motivates us to investigate these two cases separately .",
    "the null results of susy search at the lhc significantly and meaningfully constrain the masses of colored particles of susy @xcite .",
    "the experimental groups usually present their results in the cmssm and some simplified models without considering any other physical constraints .",
    "recently , quite a few efforts have been devoted to interpret and the lhc search bounds on both the mssm  @xcite and the nmssm @xcite with full low energy physical constraints . in these works ,",
    "the first two generation squarks have usually been excluded up to about 1.4 @xmath4 1.5 tev .",
    "nevertheless , the bounds on the third generation squarks are weaker due to their small production rates @xcite .",
    "the gluino , which is have already excluded up to 1.4 tev in some constrained model , can be as light as @xmath5 gev , if the mass spectrum is compressed @xcite .",
    "all this features are consistent with the natural susy spectrum , which motivate us to examine various scenarios of the natural susy , where the the third generation squarks and gluino may be light",
    ".    the light gluino can play important roles in the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking , dark matter relic density , and gauge coupling unification at high scale .",
    "light gluino scenarios can be well - motivated by grand unified theories ( guts ) and string models , for example , the intersecting d - brane models  @xcite , the f - theory guts  @xcite , the g2-mssm  @xcite , the unnatural susy  @xcite , the split susy scenario @xcite as well as the pev ( split ) susy scenario @xcite , the natural susy proposed in @xcite , the hidden susy scenario @xcite , and the compressed susy scenario @xcite .",
    "due to its large production rate , the light gluino scenarios have been a focus of phenomenological researches .",
    "its discovery potential at the early lhc runs has been explored in literatures .",
    "for example , in the reference @xcite , the signature of a long lived gluino under the split susy has been explored .",
    "as shown in reference @xcite , a broad and diverse sample of light gluino scenarios ( from 350 gev to 700 gev ) in minimal and non - minimal supergravity models are proposed . in the reference @xcite , the scenarios of nearly degenerate",
    "gaugino masses are considered .",
    "the pair production of light gluino can have multi - top final states @xcite and multi - b final states @xcite , and it is expected that the multi - lepton and multi - b jet channels are sensitive to light gluino mass region due to the clean sm background .    the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) like neutralino can be a cold dark matter candidate .",
    "the light gluino scenarios can also address the dark matter relic density in our universe via the gluino - lsp coannihilation , which motivate us to examine such scenarios with current lhc data . among them as given in ref .",
    "@xcite , the gluino - lsp coannihilation region is represented by points lg3 - 5 .",
    "such a scenario might lead to a long lifetime gluino and chargino , which can have interesting lhc phenomenologies , like the displaced kink appeared in the detectors , as explored in reference @xcite where the signature of gluino decaying to wino - like lsp is considered .",
    "the long lived charged wino can also be captured by the silicon tracker detectors at the atlas and cms experiments .",
    "more recent work on the detection of gluino - lsp coannihilaiton can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the search for compressed susy by using monojet signature has been carefully evaluated .",
    "light gluino scenarios accompanied with a light third generation of squarks have been the intense search focus at the lhc . according to the susy search results from the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations ,",
    "gluino mass has been excluded up to @xmath4 1.3 tev with @xmath6 in the cmssm / msugra .",
    "the upper limit reduces to @xmath4 750 gev with decoupled squarks .",
    "if interpreted in simplified models , different decay patterns have been considered separately . for the 100% decay chain : @xmath7 ( mediated by a virtual @xmath8 )",
    ", the allowed gluino mass has been pushed up to @xmath4 1.2 tev for the lsp lighter than @xmath4 400 gev , and @xmath4 750 gev for all available lsp masses .",
    "as for the decay chain @xmath9 ( mediated by a virtual @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 has been ruled out with @xmath12 .",
    "a gluino lighter than @xmath4 1 tev with @xmath13 are excluded in the non - b tagging analysis .",
    "bounds for a long - lived @xmath14 which can form a r - hadron are also available , where @xmath15 are excluded by using the signature of slow - moving objects ( low @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) in the detectors .",
    "it should be noticed that all experimental bounds at the lhc are obtained by using some simple assumptions , where typically the decay branching fraction is oversimplified to be either vanishing or @xmath18 . in reality , to evaluate whether these light gluino models are still alive or dead , model dependence must be carefully examined .",
    "for such a purpose , a more reliable approach is the monte carlo simulation , where model dependence can be correctly accounted for .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the bounds to light gluino scenarios in a concrete model ",
    "the nmssm . to incorporate the direct search for susy",
    ", we assume that squarks of the first two generations are heavier than @xmath19 tev , while allow the squarks of the third generation and gluino to be light .",
    "we explore two cases of interpretations for the higgs boson data : ( 1 ) the lightest cp - even higgs boson is around @xmath20 gev ; ( 2 ) the second lightest cp - even higgs boson is around @xmath20 gev .",
    "we find that the gluino - lsp coannihilation region in the natural susy models has been ruled out , and the gluino mass must be larger than 1.1 tev .",
    "the reason can be attributed to the fact that the coannihilation region demands that the gluino is around 300 gev .",
    "but , due to its huge cross section , the bounds derived from the associated mono - jet process @xmath21 and the @xmath22 analysis approach require that the gluino mass be larger than 400 gev .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath22 analysis approach is also sensitive to the coannihilation region due to a relatively large fraction of boosted data sample in the signal events .",
    "therefore , in the natural nmssm , in order to be consistent with all experimental data , the current bounds on gluino mass must be larger than 1100 gev ( with sbottom mass up to 600 gev and stop mass up to 550 gev ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the markov chain monte carlo method and our scanning strategy as well as the experimental bounds except the direct susy search bounds . in section iii , we tabulate the main direct susy search bounds considered in this work , describe our workflow , and present our main numerical analysis . in section iv , we examine the constraints on the benchmark points proposed in literatures and propose a few new benchmark points for future lhc runs and future colliders .",
    "we end this paper with discussions and conclusion .",
    "to be general , we scan the parameter space of the natural nmssm defined at the electroweak scale",
    ". the null search results of the signature of colored squarks at the lhc constrain the first two generation squark masses to be heavier than 1.5 tev , which motivates us to set their mass parameters as follows : @xmath23 then we are left with a 15 dimensional parameter space ( for the sake of simplicity , we fix @xmath24 . ) to be considered . to capture the typical features of natural susy and light gluino scenarios , we choose the range of these parameters as : @xmath25 obviously , it is very difficult to find the typical features of such parameter space since its dimensionality is too high to scan in a grid method or in a random scanning method .",
    "supposed we need 10 points in one dimensional parameter space , then we need @xmath26 points at least for the current situation .",
    "to circumvent such an issue of computational cost , instead , we adopt the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method  @xcite in our scanning .",
    "the mcmc method is a sampling method to generate a chain of points of the parameter space with a density distribution consistent with experimental constraints . in this method ,",
    "the computational time at its best is proportional to the dimensionality in a linear way , in contrast to the power way in the random scanning method .",
    "the mcmc method has been widely adopted in numerical analysis of many research fields , especially in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "recently , this method has also been applied in susy model scanning @xcite .",
    "the method is inspired from the bayesian theorem which can be put as below : @xmath27 where , @xmath28 is defined as the _ posterior probability _ of the hypothesis after taking into account experimental data .",
    "@xmath29 is the _ sampling distribution _ of the data assuming the hypothesis is true . and",
    "if it is considered as a function of the hypothesis for fixed data , it is called the _",
    "likelihood function_. @xmath30 is the _ prior probability _ which represents our state of knowledge before seeing the data .",
    "@xmath31 is the _ marginal likelihood _ which is just a normalization factor in our case and will be ignored from now .    in this work ,",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 denote a set of computed experimental observables in the model and a set of model parameters given in eq .",
    "( [ input ] ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath28 is the desired distribution in the parameter space of our scanning after taking into account all experimental constraints .",
    "@xmath30 is taken as flat distribution in this work , which is defined as : @xmath34 @xmath29 denotes the likelihood function determined by experimental constraints , which is defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the likelihood function of each of experimental constraints .",
    "main experimental constraints considered in this work are listed in table  [ constraints ] .",
    "when the xenon100 results are applied in our scanning , the proton - dm scattering cross section is rescaled by the formula @xmath37 . and",
    "the likelihood functions @xmath36 adopted in this work can be classified into three categories :    * exclusion bounds imposed by setting the likelihood to be zero if the point is already excluded and to be one if it is not excluded .",
    "for example , to impose a likelihood value for all theoretical points in our scanning , we assign a zero value to a point if it is unphysical or theoretically unacceptable . here",
    "a point is unphysical or theoretically unacceptable have quite a few meanings : the point might run into a landau pole for some of its physics parameters at some energy scales , or might lead to a unphysical global minimum at the electroweak symmetry scale , or might have a spectra with a tachyonic mass for a particle , or might have a spectra of which the lightest neutralino is not lsp , or might fail to reach a convergent rge solution , or might possess no electroweak symmetry breaking . and the bound of the xenon100 and the bounds from tevatron and lep on the masses of sparticles and higgs boson are realized in this way . * upper bounds described by step functions : @xmath38-d_{\\textrm{upper}}}{0.01 \\,\\,d_{\\textrm{upper}}}]}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 $ ] means the observable computed in the nmssm .",
    "for example , the bound of dark matter relics density is realized by a step function .",
    "although we also use a step function to the rare decay @xmath40 , we notice that the lhcb collaboration claimed a discovery of this mode with measured branching fraction @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , our main results are not sensitive to this bound .",
    "* physics constraints described by gaussian functions with well measured central values and deviations @xmath42-d_{\\textrm{cen}})^2}{\\sigma^2}].\\ ] ] for example , the likelihood function of higgs boson mass is taken as a gaussian function with a central value 125 gev and an allowed deviation is taken as 2 gev .",
    ".physical bounds which have been taken into account in our scanning are listed here . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ bmp4 ]    for each case , two benchmark points are presented ( mass of lhc higgs is shown in boldface ) .",
    "for the first case , benchmark point i has a very light sbottom @xmath43 , which survives from the constraints of the susy direct search owing to a heavy lsp(260 gev ) .",
    "such a benchmark point might be probed by the full dataset collected with @xmath44 tev , as shown in @xcite .",
    "benchmark point ii has a relatively light stop ( 589 gev ) , which dominantly decay to @xmath45 and @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "longer cascade decay chains result in more objects in the final state , many of which are too soft to be reconstructed by detectors of the lhc .    for the second case , benchmark point iii and iv have relatively heavier stops and sbottoms which are safe to current lhc constraints .",
    "however , point iv have all five neutralinos and two charginos very light ( wino masses are only 317 gev ) .",
    "it would be expected that the neutralino - chargino search(mainly through tripleton and same - signed leptons signal ) at lhc should be sensitive to this point . and",
    "this point gets correct relic density by virtue of the large singlino component(@xmath49 ) of lsp , while the other three points has lsp mostly higgsino - like ( i and iii ) or wino - like ( ii ) .",
    "it is noticed that masses of the gluinos are around @xmath50 .",
    "the main branching fractions of dominant decay modes of gluino are tabluated . as one can see , the gluino will dominantly decay to @xmath51 and @xmath52 which are exactly the representive simplified models explored by atlas and cms",
    ". these benchmark points can be detected in the future lhc runs .",
    "and the recent susy search results with @xmath44 tev presented in the moroind 2013 ew could be sensitive to these points .    another",
    "interesting fact is that all the sleptons are lighter than @xmath53 , currently lhc results can not impose meaningful constraint to slepton sectors ( the lhc results can probe the sletpons with masses up to 200 gev ) .",
    "the future lhc runs at higher collision energies , either @xmath54 or @xmath55 tev can start to probe them .",
    "we have extended the analysis @xcite by including more lhc experimental bounds . in order to test the reliability of the results , we perform a thorough check to our package .",
    "we have used 21 test points in total to compare with experimental results .",
    "these 21 test points have been tabulated in table ( [ testp ] ) , where tp1 - 7 denote benchmark points of the cmssm as shown in fig .",
    "[ cmssm ] . and gbs and gts are benchmark points of the simplified model , with @xmath56 or @xmath57 with a branching fraction @xmath18 . in addition",
    ", the test points labelled as `` ew1-ew7 '' denote specific benchmark points designed for the electroweakinos search @xcite , whose decay modes are also displayed . for test points  ew1-ew5 \" , we assume @xmath58 .      the results of 21 points are tabulated in table ( [ chktbl ] ) . in the table ,",
    "search channels are arranged by the order of the atlas and cms collaborations and in the order of collider energies , with datasets of @xmath59 tev first and followed by the datasets of @xmath44 tev . for the multilepton channel",
    ", we list the check results separately .    in each row of the table ( [ chktbl ] )",
    ", one can read the results for each search channel .",
    "for example , it is noticed that the search channel  1 - 2b - jets + 1 - 2l \" is insensitive to all our test points , since this channel is designed for very light stop ( with mass similar to , or lighter than top quark ) search .    from table ( [ chktbl ] ) , we can observe a fact that for test points  tp1-tp7 \" ,  gb1-gb3 \" , and  gt1-gt4 \" , the @xmath60 observable is quite sensitive to most of signals , similar to our observations in section iii .",
    "furthermore , the results for the `` multilepton '' search channel also agree with experimental ones @xcite very well .",
    "it is also obvious that the sensitivity of a specific search channel can perform better for the dataset of @xmath44 tev than that of @xmath59 tev due to the enhancement of cross sections , as demonstrated in the channels  multijet \" of the atlas and  2ssl + b- \" of the cms .    in the `` jets+mht '' search channel",
    ", one can read out that for seven cmssm test points five are all excluded except for tp5 and tp7 , which is in agreement with the results of cms-7tev as shown in fig .",
    "[ cmssm ] . while the result for gb1 shows a minor deviation . as shown in fig .",
    "[ sms ] , this test point should have been excluded by the search channel ",
    "jets + @xmath61 \" , while our result underestimates the constraint with a @xmath62 .",
    "we observed that most of our results agree with experimental results , though there are some results showing deviations .",
    "for example , the  gb3 \" is under - constrained by the 2ssl + b - jets channel , and the  gt4 \" is over - constrained by the @xmath60 analysis approach and is under - constrained by the multijet channel .",
    "compared with experimental results , these deviations of @xmath63 values in table ( [ chktbl ] ) can be typically around @xmath64 or so , which can only affect the results of those points near the exclusion edges of experimental results .",
    "for example , the results of  gb3 \" and  gt4 \" should be excluded by the corresponding experimental search channels , but can survive in our analysis . when a point is far away from the edge and inside the exclusion region , our results are trustable , like the test point",
    " gt1 \" .",
    "meanwhile , we notice that when the gluino mass is shifted by @xmath65 gev , the deviations can be removed and agreements can be achieved .",
    "the deviations in @xmath63 can be attributed to the small fluctuations from monte carlo simulations and the difference between the fast detector simulation and the real detector effects .",
    "our bottom line is that our results at least motivate experimentalists to perform a more detailed and serious bounds when all types of uncertainties are taken into account .",
    "based on our analysis shown above , below we comment on light gluino models in literatures .",
    "models in the coannihilation region as demonstrated by lg3 - 5 given in @xcite can be ruled out due to the mono - jet search and by the @xmath22 and @xmath60 analysis ( due to the boosted sample events ) from the cms if the branching fraction @xmath66 is dominant . due to the large mass splitting between the gluino and the lsp and the energetic final states , light gluino scenarios with mass range [ 500,700 ] gev in the so - called higgs pole region of the minimal universal sugra @xcite",
    "is heavily disfavored .",
    "the two benchmark points presented in ref .",
    "@xcite has been excluded due to their large cross sections and large mass splittings .",
    "we also find that even for the coannihilation region ( say @xmath67 gev ) the mono - jet bounds can be valid for gluino mass up to 400 gev at least , as shown by the right plot of fig .",
    "( [ mt2andmonoj ] ) .",
    "the last but not the least , in our scanning , we have not found points near the region @xmath68 gev . such models should exist since there is no upper bounds for the lsp , as demonstrated in the fig .",
    "( 8c ) of @xcite by few red points , where the scanning ranges for parameters of neutralino and gluino are wider than those in our scanning .    with results shown above",
    ", we would like to conclude : 1 ) the parameter space of the natural nmssm has been significantly shrunken by the direct susy search bounds from the atlas and cms collaborations ; 2 ) the gluino - lsp coannihilation region in the first case of interpretations of the higgs boson data has been completely ruled out by the boosted signal samples .",
