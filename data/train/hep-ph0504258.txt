    "in the limit of purely strong interactions the @xmath0 scattering amplitudes at threshold are fundamental quantities which enter into the discussion of various problems .",
    "they provide , for example , a basic test of the tomozawa - weinberg chiral relation for the isoscalar and isovector scattering lengths in the limit @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the pion decay constant@xcite and @xmath6 at threshold .",
    "the empirical isovector scattering length is the main ingredient and uncertainty in the forward dispersion relation , by which the @xmath7 coupling constant @xmath8 is determined@xcite etc .. the major precision source for these quantities are the remarkable measurements of the 1s level shifts in pionic hydrogen and deuterium as well as the corresponding widths . in the case of pionic hydrogen ,",
    "present experiments have , or will shortly achieve , a precision of @xmath9 for the shift and @xmath10 for the width @xcite and these quantities convert in principle to similar precision for the scattering amplitudes .",
    "there are 2 major ways by which one can approach the problem of determining the @xmath2 scattering length from pionic hydrogen data .",
    "the first is chiral effective field theory ( eft ) @xcite .",
    "here one starts from an effective lagrangian in the chiral limit and makes first a systematic expansion in orders @xmath11 of momentum corrections .",
    "the e.  m. contribution to order @xmath12 and the strong symmetry breaking are then expanded as small additional corrections .",
    "this approach introduces empirical constants to summarize short range contributions and these must be determined from experiments .",
    "the other major approach , which i will follow below , is complementary and less ambitious  @xcite .",
    "it starts from the empirical low energy expansion of the strong interaction amplitude in terms of energy and momentum .",
    "it is rather well explored including its principal dynamic features , although the experimental value of the scattering length needs further tuning .",
    "this system has well defined e.  m. and axial form factors of the pion and nucleon ( @xmath1 ) which are experimentally known as are the physical masses . starting from this knowledge , we determine the e.  m. corrections .",
    "the main guiding tool is minimal e.  m. coupling or , in other words , current conservation .",
    "in addition , we use the same minimal coupling principle to determine the dispersive contributions from the radiative capture processes dominated by the nucleon and @xmath1 isobar intermediate states . for this last problem",
    ", it is a considerable simplification to work in the heavy baryon limit and we will do so below .",
    "this approximation is also used in the eft approach .",
    "the objective of this second approach is to obtain an intuitive picture of the corrections and the physical mechanisms of isospin breaking .",
    "it will become clear that kinematic considerations in the wide sense is the key to several of the effects .",
    "the plan is the following .",
    "i first discuss the nature and physics of the corrections to the leading order deser - trueman formula @xcite , which relates the energy shift to the scattering length .",
    "i then discuss inner e.  m. corrections to the s wave scattering of charged pions from the nucleon at threshold and show that the dominant term is intimately connected to the well established p - wave @xmath0 scattering physics and the @xmath1 isobar .",
    "this contribution can summarized by the eft chiral parameter @xmath13",
    "finally , i make a tentative comparison with the results of the eft approach .",
    "the s - wave threshold amplitude for the strong interaction has in the case of a single channel the low energy expansion @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the momentum and @xmath16 are the scattering length and the range term respectively .",
    "such an expansion does not by itself assume isospin invariance , but it means implicitly a short ranged interaction .",
    "the atom is highly non - relativistic . to leading order the strong interaction shift is obtained using the @xmath17 wave function for the point coulomb field @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the reduced mass and @xmath20 over the strong interaction region .",
    "if we assume that the amplitude of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) results from a short ranged pseudo - potential ( effective interaction lagrangian ) , the leading order @xmath17 strong interaction energy shift is simply the born approximation term : @xmath21 this is the time - honored standard reference shift referred to as the deser - trueman formula  @xcite and there are of course corresponding expressions for any @xmath22 state .",
    "we now generalize this expression .    -assume that the coulomb field without strong interactions to be generated by the extended charge distributions of the pion and the proton .",
    "the corresponding e.  m. form factor @xmath23 is experimentally known .",
    "its origin is in principle irrelevant , although the issue of a dirac versus a pauli form factor of the proton must be faced later , when we compare to results of eft in the heavy baryon limit . at this stage",
    "the pauli form factor is the relevant one ..    -this problem is highly non - relativistic and well described using wave functions . outside the extended charge , the exact solution is the whittaker function .",
    "-in the limit that the strong interaction ( [ eq:1 ] ) has a negligible range compared to that of the charge distribution , the corresponding strong interaction energy shift has an exact solution  @xcite .",
    "-for the energy dependence of the scattering length we use the minimal e.  m. coupling principle \" or gauge invariance and replace the energy of a charged particle @xmath24 . another way of saying the same thing is that one should locally at the interaction point use the correct interaction energy in the coulomb potential",
    "there are now 3 separate physical effects @xcite .",
    "first , the starting wave function at the origin is improved using the coulomb potential corresponding to the joint charged distribution of the pion and proton , which is simpler to handle than the singular point coulomb interaction .",
    "second , the interaction does not correspond to the free scattering at threshold of eq.([eq:1 ] ) , but corresponds to the energy shifted to that of the coulomb potential at the interaction third , to second order in the scattering length , the binding gives characteristic cusp term which is nearly independent of assumptions .",
    "finally , we always include tacitly a small , model independent vacuum polarization correction , which is conceptually irrelevant in the present context .",
    "the extended charge changes the coulomb wave function , chopping off the singular linear behavior of the wave function near the origin , which comes from the @xmath25 behavior of the coulomb interaction .",
    "the wave function then varies normally with @xmath26 at the origin .",
    "the wave function at the origin is then @xmath27\\ ] ] here @xmath28 is the expectation value over the extended charge density .",
    "the corresponding change in the energy shift is @xmath29 detailed numerical values are given in table  1 .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]        it is of considerable interest to attempt to identify our results in the eft expansion .",
    "can we match our previous results to its explicit terms ?",
    "a problem occurs in view of the basic difference with our approach .",
    "for example , in the discussion of the coulombic terms , we start from the scattering amplitude and form factors as they would result in a description to all orders , but in the absence of e.  m. interactions ; in this sense we include physics not presently included in the eft approach .",
    "we must therefore make sure we compare comparable quantities .",
    "first , we must use form factors in the heavy baryon limit .",
    "this means that we must use the dirac form factor @xmath34 and not the pauli form factor @xmath35 ; the charge distribution generated by the magnetic moment of order @xmath36 should be omitted .",
    "we should also to this order omit the wave function correction @xmath37 of eq .",
    "( [ wfshift ] ) , for the mass scale is set by the @xmath38-meson and it is of order @xmath39 or formally of 4th order in the eft expansion .",
    "the relevant term for the comparison is generated by eq .",
    "( [ gaugeshift ] ) . here",
    "the dominant contribution comes from the isoscalar range term @xmath40 .",
    "it generates a contribution of order @xmath41 , which is of 4th order in the eft expansion and outside the present eft discussion ; it will require an additional eft constant .",
    "similarly , the pole term in the isovector range term vanishes in the heavy baryon limit .      in the heavy nucleon limit , the constant @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ f12 ] ) describes the @xmath30 e.  m. mass splitting , which then results from the coulomb self energy of the proton with the dirac form factor :   @xmath44 ^ 2/q^2 $ ] .",
    "the corresponding effect in the @xmath45 scattering must be taken in the same limit with the dirac factor . to leading order ,",
    "the strong scattering amplitude is given by the tomozawa - weinberg term ( [ weinberg ] ) , which is linear in @xmath46 .",
    "the minimal coupling procedure generates an isospin - breaking contribution : @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "compared to the proton e.  m. self energy @xmath42 above , the similarity is striking and numerically the expressions are equal to about 15% .",
    "however , if the shape of the strong interaction is included with an interaction form factor , one obtains equality if @xmath49 or , since both the nucleon and pion form factors are governed by the @xmath38-meson mass @xmath50 we here obtain unexpectedly a quantitative result for the isovector interaction form factor .",
    "the tomozawa - weinberg term is frequently associated with a monopole interaction with a range given by the @xmath38 meson mass @xmath51@xcite , while both the nucleon and the pion have form factors closely approximated by a dipole , respectively a monopole , form factor with the @xmath38-meson mass .",
    "this is suggestive , since it indicates that , indeed , the eft @xmath42 coefficient comes from the coulomb interaction . on the other hand , the eft does not presently give the shape of the form factor .",
    "the last relation implies however that there is an intrinsic link between the proton , pion and the tomozawa - weinberg interaction form factors in eft .",
    "a proper account for the coulomb interaction requires realistically that one goes beyond the present level of the eft expansion and accounts for the pauli form factor @xmath52 of the proton as well as for the terms generated by the isoscalar range term .      the dispersive contribution from intermediate @xmath53 states to the scattering length as given in eq .",
    "( [ label15 ] ) is isoscalar in the charged pion sector in the limit of a vanishing pion mass .",
    "this is exactly the symmetry property of the contribution in eft by the next - to - leading order constant @xmath13 .",
    "this constant also appears as a part of the e.  m. neutron mass @xmath54 , but then it always comes in the combination @xmath55   ( see eq.[f12 ] ) ) .",
    "these terms can not be physically separated  @xcite .",
    "here we have an interesting situation .",
    "the neutron e.  m. mass is expected to be quite small compared to the @xmath30 e.  m. mass splitting of about @xmath56 and to be dominated by the magnetic self energy .",
    "it then vanishes in the heavy baryon limit with a likely uncertainty of @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a value @xmath58 , while our value with the physical @xmath1 isobar included gives @xmath59 , which is over a magnitude larger .",
    "dimensional estimates inside of eft give intermediate estimates @xmath60  @xcite .",
    "there appears therefore numerically to be little relation of this parameter with the neutron e.  m. mass , which suggests a massive cancellation between the eft constants @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "such a cancellation occurs explicitly in a model evaluation inside a heavy quark model @xcite , which has certain similarities with our description .",
    "the connection of the constant @xmath13 to the nucleon e.  m. mass is therefore tenuous and of little practical importance .",
    "isospin violation in @xmath0 elastic scattering has been shown here to have well determined contributions originating in the coulomb field of the extended charge with little model dependence .",
    "these corrections are general and involve terms beyond present eft approaches . to leading order in the strong interactions corresponding terms have counterparts in eft in the heavy baryon approximation .",
    "in addition , terms with @xmath63 intermediate states give rise to important isoscalar isospin breaking terms which can be looked at as model descriptions of the unknown eft constant @xmath13 . for a non - vanishing pion mass , the same mechanism generates small , model insensitive , isospin breaking in the isovector interaction dependent on the pion mass .",
    "an important finding is that the isospin breaking is small in the isovector amplitude .",
    "this is consistent with the finding of meissner et al .",
    "@xcite , but it is in violent disagreement with the important violation reported by matsinos @xcite , which depends only on isospin breaking in the isovector amplitude , although the author does not explicitly state so .",
    "the matsinos results have also been shown to be grossly at variance with the empirical scattering lengths deduced from pionic hydrogen and deuterium  @xcite .",
    "although therefore the chiral eft constants @xmath64 can be rather well understood from physical effects , this is not the whole story .",
    "our terms include the main part , but not all , of the isospin breaking mechanisms .",
    "in addition to the effects discussed here , the effective field theory generates generic isospin breaking beyond our considerations . these additional terms appear in charge exchange and @xmath65 elastic scattering .",
    "they are are conceptually important non - trivial chiral predictions .",
    "numerically , such contributions are of the order of 1% and of similar magnitude as the terms we consider .",
    "obviously a quantitative test of the predictions of eft requires that that these intrinsic terms be reliably separated from those which are generated by the general mechanisms discussed here .",
    "a meaningful analysis will require both approaches .",
