    "in recent years it has become possible to couple charge dynamics of electrons to vibrational modes of a nanostructure , and the new field of nanoelectromechanics has emerged.@xcite nanoelectromechanical devices are expected to lead to new technologies , such as ultra - small mass detection techniques,@xcite as well as stimulating fundamental studies of quantum phenomena in macroscopic systems.@xcite for example , experiments have probed high - frequency nanomechanical resonators in order to reach the quantum uncertainty limit.@xcite charge transfer by mechanical motion has been studied in experiments shuttling single electrons .",
    "@xcite nanomechanical resonators are investigated for use in quantum information processing.@xcite    the simplest possibility of detection and control of the vibrational degree of freedom in a nanomechanical system is at present via the coupling to a quantum point contact or a tunnel junction .",
    "recent theoretical studies of nanoelectromechanical systems have therefore considered the coupling of a harmonic oscillator to a tunnel junction .",
    "the master equation for the oscillator was originally obtained by mozyrsky and martin,@xcite using a method limiting considerations to the zero - temperature case , and the influence of the coupled oscillator on the average current was obtained .",
    "smirnov , mourokh and horing examined the non - equilibrium fluctuations of an oscillator coupled to a biased tunnel junction.@xcite clerk and girvin derived the master equation for the oscillator , and considered the current noise power spectrum in the shot noise regime , studying both the _ dc _ and _",
    "ac _ cases.@xcite armour , blencowe and zhang considered the dynamics of a classical oscillator coupled to a single electron transistor,@xcite and armour the induced current noise.@xcite related models were studied in molecular electronics.@xcite    tunnel junctions functioning as position detectors or being monitored by a vibrational mode put emphasis on a description of the current properties of a tunnel junction in terms of its charge dynamics .",
    "recently we considered a general many - body system coupled to a quantum object and considered their joint dynamics in the charge representation.@xcite this approach , based on a previously introduced charge projection technique,@xcite provides a quantum description of charge dynamics based directly on the density matrix for the system , and allows us to treat the number of particles in a given piece of material as a quantum degree of freedom , establishing thereby in proper quantum mechanical context the charge representation .",
    "the evolution of the coupled systems is described in terms of the charge specific density matrix for the quantum object , @xmath0 , i.e. , the dynamics conditioned on the number @xmath1 of charges in a specified spatial region of the environment . when a many - body environment is coupled to another quantum object",
    ", the method allows evaluating at any moment in time the joint probability distribution describing the quantum state of the object and the number of charges in the chosen region of the many - body system .",
    "the charge specific density matrix description of the dynamics of a quantum object is therefore an optimal tool to study transport in nanostructures since in electrical measurements any information beyond the charge distribution is irrelevant .",
    "so far we have applied the method to charge counting in a tunnel junction coupled to a discrete quantum degree of freedom , viz . that of a two - level system , and shown that the charge state of the junction can function as a meter providing a projective measurement of the quantum state of the two - level system.@xcite    in this paper we shall apply the charge projection method to the case where the quantum object coupled to the junction is a continuous degree of freedom . in particular , we shall concentrate on the properties of the current through the junction due to the coupling to the quantum object .",
    "the statistical properties of the current through the junction and its correlations with the dynamics of the quantum object coupled to it , shall be expressed through the charge specific density matrix .",
    "we shall illustrate the results for the case of a harmonic oscillator coupled to the tunnel junction .",
    "it should be noticed , that current experimental setups studying nanoelectromechanical systems are operated under conditions where temperature , oscillator excitation energy , and voltage bias across the junction are comparable.@xcite furthermore , nanomechanical oscillators , such as a suspended beam , are in addition to the charge dynamics of the electrons in the junction invariably coupled to a thermal environment , say the substrate upon which the oscillator is mounted .",
    "we are thus considering the situation where a quantum object in addition to interacting with a heat bath is interacting with an environment out of equilibrium . having the additional parameter , the voltage , characterizing the environment in non - equilibrium , gives rise to features not present for an object coupled to a many - body system in equilibrium .",
    "the presented approach is applicable in a broad region of temperatures and voltages of the junction and arbitrary frequency of the oscillator and thus generalizes previous treatments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the model hamiltonian for a generic electromechanical nanoresonator , a harmonic oscillator coupled to a tunnel junction , and derive the markovian master equation for the charge specific density matrix .",
    "the master equation for the charge unconditional density matrix , i.e. , the charge specific density matrix traced with respect to the charge degree of freedom of the junction , is discussed in detail for the case of a harmonic oscillator coupled to a tunnel junction . in sec .",
    "iii we consider the influence of the oscillator on the current - voltage characteristic of the junction . in sec .",

    "we calculate the heating of the oscillator due to the nonequilibrium state of the junction , and calculate the steady state i - v characteristic of the junction . in sec .",
    "v we consider the current noise in the junction using the charge representation , and obtain the explicit expression for the current - current correlator in the markovian approximation . in sec .",
    "vi , the theory is then applied to the case of an oscillator influencing the current noise of the junction . finally , in sec .",

    "as a model of a nanoelectromechanical system we consider a harmonic oscillator coupled to a tunnel junction .",
    "the transparency of the tunnel barrier is assumed perturbed by the displacement , @xmath2 , of the oscillator .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the hamiltonian for the isolated harmonic oscillator with bare frequency @xmath5 and mass @xmath6 .",
    "a hat marks operators acting on the oscillator degree of freedom .",
    "the hamiltonians @xmath7 specify the isolated left and right electrodes of the junction @xmath8 where @xmath9 labels the quantum numbers of the single particle energy eigenstates in the left and right electrodes , respectively , with corresponding energies @xmath10 .",
    "the operator @xmath11 describes the tunnelling , @xmath12 with the tunneling amplitudes , @xmath13 , depending on the oscillator degree of freedom .",
    "due to the coupling , the tunnelling amplitudes and thereby the conductance of the tunnel junction depend on the state of the oscillator . in the following",
    "we assume a linear coupling between the oscillator position and the tunnel junction @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the unperturbed tunneling amplitude and @xmath16 its derivative with respect to the position of the oscillator .",
    "the derivation of the equation of motion for the charge specific density matrix presented in appendix [ xconditional master equation ] shows that the following combinations of the model parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 enter the master equation : @xmath19 these lumped parameters for the junction have the following physical meaning : let @xmath20 , @xmath21 being the electron charge , denote the conductance as a function of the oscillator coordinate @xmath2 when it is treated as a classical variable .",
    "then , @xmath22 gives the conductance of the junction in the absence of coupling to the oscillator , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "it is convenient to present the coupling constants in terms of _ conductances _ by introducing the characteristic length of the oscillator @xmath29 where @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the frequency of the coupled oscillator as introduced in appendix [ xconditional master equation ] .      to study the interaction of charge dynamics in a tunnel junction with the dynamics of a quantum object , we describe the combined system , the quantum degree of freedom coupled to a tunnel junction , using the charge specific density matrix method introduced in ref .",
    "the approach employs charge projectors to study the dynamics of the quantum object conditioned on the charge state of the junction .",
    "the charge projection operator , @xmath32 , projects the state of the conduction electrons in the junction onto its component for which exactly @xmath1 electrons are in a given spatial region , say in the left electrode . the charge specific density matrix",
    "is then specified by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the full density matrix for the combined system , and @xmath35 denotes the trace with respect to the conduction electrons in the junction .",

    "thus the charge projector method provides a basis for charge counting statistics in the cases where the distribution function for _ transferred _ charge is relevant as discussed in ref . .",
    "the charge specific density matrix allows therefore the evaluation , at any moment in time , of the joint probability of the quantum state of the object and the number of charges transferred through the junction .",
    "for example , if the charge specific density matrix is traced over the quantum object degree of freedom , the probability @xmath39 that @xmath1 charges in time span @xmath40 are _ transferred _ through the low transparency tunnel junction is the expectation value of the charge projector , or expressed in terms of the charge specific density matrix @xmath41 where the trace is with respect to the degree of freedom of the coupled quantum object .",
    "the markovian master equation for the charge specific density matrix , @xmath42 , for the case of coupling of the junction to a quantum object is derived and discussed in appendix [ xconditional master equation ] .",
