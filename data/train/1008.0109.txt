    "consider the following question in planar geometry : _ given three , nonconcurrent lines , @xmath14 , along with three angles @xmath15 satisfying @xmath2 , find three points @xmath16 such that _ @xmath17 _ and _ @xmath18 somewhat informally , with @xmath19 playing the roles of the points of mutual intersection of the lines @xmath20 , this asks whether given a fixed triangle @xmath21 , one can inscribe a triangle @xmath22 of an arbitrarily prescribed shape . for a triangle , `` shape '' simply signifies the measures of its angles ( in the current scenario @xmath12 ) .",
    "although not necessarily obvious , this question turns out to have an affirmative answer .",
    "in fact , the collection @xmath23 of all triangles @xmath22 satisfying ( [ madden1 ] ) and ( [ madden2 ] ) has infinite cardinality . since all triangles in @xmath23",
    "have the _ same shape _ , what distinguishes them is their _",
    "size_. it is not too difficult to show that @xmath23 contains triangles of arbitrarily large areas , hence , the most distinguished triangle in @xmath23 is the one of the _ smallest _ area , called , for the purposes of this introduction , @xmath24 .",
    "part of our paper is devoted to studying this minimizer , which enjoys many interesting properties . among other things",
    "we show that this triangle of minimal area is unique , and is also a _ pedal triangle_. recall that a pedal triangle is a triangle whose vertices are the projections of a point , called the pedal point of the pedal triangle , onto the sides of another triangle .",
    "let @xmath25 be the pedal point of @xmath24 .",
    "of course , similar considerations apply to the situation when the ordered triplet @xmath26 in ( [ madden2 ] ) is replaced by any of its permutations @xmath27 as before , these permutations lead to considering the collections @xmath23 , @xmath28 , ... , defined as above , which in turn have their own minimizers , @xmath29 once again , they are all pedal triangles with respect to six points , say , @xmath30 remarkably , even though these six points are obtained via constructions that start from starkly different sets of premises , they turn out to be concyclic . that is ,    [ th - intr ] there exists a circle that contains all six points in ( [ pedal-1.1 ] ) .",
    "this is the main result of the paper ( cf .",
    "theorem  [ tata3.3 ] for a formal statement ) .",
    "the starting point in its proof is to consider , besides the area - minimizing triangle inscribed in @xmath0 and having prescribed angles , the _ area - maximizing triangle circumscribed to _",
    "@xmath0 , having the same angles .",
    "this dual aspect of the problem under consideration is very useful in understanding the nature of the extremal triangles of a prescribed shape .",
    "a concrete step in this regard is proving a structure theorem , detailing how these three triangles are related to one another .",
    "for instance , we show that _ the area of the original triangle is the geometric mean of the area - minimizer and the area - maximizer triangles _ ; cf .",
    "theorem  [ tata444 ] .",
    "since the conclusion in theorem  [ th - intr ] involves a circle , it is not unnatural that another important tool in its proof is the _ geometrical inversion_.    in @xmath31 , the properties of the area - minimizing and area - maximizing triangles having prescribed angles and being , respectively , inscribed and circumscribed in a given triangle are examined .",
    "finally , @xmath32 is devoted to presenting the proof of the six point circle theorem .",
    "the presentation in this paper is largely self - contained . for more basic concepts and definitions related to the geometry of the triangle the interested reader",
    "is referred to , e.g. @xcite , and the references therein .",
    "throughout , we let @xmath0 denote the triangle with vertices @xmath19 and denote by @xmath33 the area of @xmath34 .    given a triangle @xmath35 along with a triangle @xmath36 inscribed in it , we first recall a result from @xcite that gives a procedure for obtaining a triangle , @xmath37 , that is inscribed in @xmath38 and is homotopic to @xmath39 . by definition ,",
    "two triangles are homotopic if their corresponding sides are parallel .",
    "the concurrence point of the lines passing through the corresponding vertices of two homotopic triangles is the homotopy center .",
    "the justification of the following useful result is left to the interested reader ( a proof is given in @xcite ) .",
    "[ tata111 ] let @xmath39 be arbitrary and assume that @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ( see figure  1 below ) . take @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 such that @xmath46 then @xmath39 and @xmath47 are homotopic and , in addition , @xmath48 is the geometric mean of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , i.e. latexmath:[\\ ] ]    the key step in the proof is to make at this stage an inversion of center @xmath94 and arbitrary modulus .",
    "since the lines @xmath53 and @xmath55 pass through @xmath94 , they will remain unchanged .",
    "the points @xmath95 , @xmath96 become @xmath303 and @xmath304 , respectively . the circles @xmath305 , @xmath306 , @xmath307 will be transformed into the lines @xmath308 , @xmath309 and @xmath310 respectively , which are concurrent at @xmath303 .",
    "meanwhile , the circles @xmath311 , @xmath312 and @xmath313 become the lines @xmath314 , @xmath315 and @xmath316 , respectively , which are concurrent at @xmath304 .",
    "the points @xmath317 will be transformed into @xmath318 and @xmath319,respectively , and @xmath320 , @xmath321 , @xmath322 , @xmath323 , @xmath324 , @xmath325 .",
    "the goal is to show that the points @xmath326 lie on the same circle .",
    "we note that since under an inversion the angle between two curves is preserved , we have @xmath327 , as the angle between two circles is defined to be the angle between the tangents at one of their common points",
    ". therefore , @xmath328 .",
    "however , @xmath329 on the other hand @xmath330 and @xmath331 .",
    "hence , @xmath332 and @xmath333 .",
    "let @xmath334 be the tangent at @xmath95 to the circle determined by the points @xmath335 , @xmath303 , @xmath304",
    ". then @xmath336",
    ". however , @xmath337 , and @xmath338 , where @xmath339 denotes the circle containing @xmath19 .",
    "therefore @xmath340 we have the pairs of lines @xmath341 , @xmath342 , @xmath343 having the same slope as the line @xmath54 , and by symmetry , we see that @xmath344 . hence , @xmath345 and @xmath346 . as a consequence",
    ", the quadrilateral @xmath347 is inscribable . since @xmath348",
    ", it follows that the quadrilateral @xmath349 is also inscribable .",
    "the quadrilateral @xmath349 is an isosceles trapezoid , hence it is inscribable as well . as a result , @xmath319 lies on the circumscribed circle to the quadrilateral @xmath350 .",
    "since @xmath351 lies on the circumscribed circle to the quadrilateral @xmath352 , it follows that all the points @xmath288 , @xmath353 , lie on the same circle",
    ".    * remark  4 .",
    "* since the interior points lie on a circle , it follows that the exterior points lie on a circle ( the transformed under the inversion of center @xmath137 and modulus @xmath133 of the former circle ) ."
