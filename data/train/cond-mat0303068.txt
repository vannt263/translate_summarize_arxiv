    "disorder effects in the transport properties of quantum wires have been the subject of extensive investigations in recent years . among these works , models with pure off - diagonal disorder",
    "have been studied in connection to peculiar properties that seem to differentiate them from models with pure diagonal disorder only @xcite .",
    "unusual phenomena like anomalies in the density of states ( dos ) and in the localization properties of quantum wires have been reported for a random hopping model of disorder in the vicinity of energy @xmath0 . as an example , in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors pointed out that , for a wire with an odd number of channels and at the band center , the conductance decays algebraically with the wire length rather than exponentially , as is usual in the problem of anderson localization @xcite .",
    "these behaviors have been attributed to the existence of a delocalized state at @xmath0 that arises as a consequence of an additional lattice symmetry , absent in models with pure diagonal disorder . due to this symmetry , referred as chiral",
    ", the eigenvalues appear in pairs @xmath1 and the spectrum is symmetric with respect to @xmath0 @xcite .    however , for other models of disorder with chiral symmetry the existence of a delocalized state near the center of the band is still a subject of debate @xcite .",
    "one source of discrepancy is the large localization length obtained near the center of the band , that makes difficult to decide from numerical data whether or not states are localized .    in view of this controversy",
    ", we find instructive to study an alternative model of disorder that , like the random hopping model , has chiral symmetry .",
    "the localization properties will be inferred from conductance calculations performed in wire like geometries .",
    "disorder is induced introducing a number of vacancies @xmath2 at random positions in a regular lattice that defines the wire .",
    "vacancies represent sites with an infinite energy that block the motion of the electrons .",
    "therefore the only way an electron may propagate across the sample is through a path with no vacancies .",
    "this model could be thought as a limiting case of the random site percolation problem @xcite known as the binary - alloy model @xcite .    for quasi - one dimensional wires",
    "we show that , unlike the random hopping model , the present model of disorder exhibits exponential localization at the band center irrespective of the parity in the number of transmission channels .",
    "we propose an analytical formula that reproduces the behavior of the mean conductance as a function of the vacancy concentration . for wide wires ,",
    "as finite size effects become important in the mesoscopic regime , a detailed analysis of the influence of the geometry on the conductance and on the localization properties will be performed .    as the vacancy concentration increases above a critical value we show that ultra - localized states are formed .",
    "these states influence dramatically the value of the conductance and a transition towards the suppression of the conductance in the wires is observed .",
    "the present model supports the conjecture that the chiral symmetry appears to be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the existence of anomalies at the band center in the localization properties of disordered quantum wires .",
    "the wires are stripes of length @xmath3 and width @xmath4 defined on a square lattice . we employ the tight - binding hamiltonian with a single atomic level per site : @xmath5 where the operator @xmath6 destroys an electron on the site @xmath7 .",
    "all the hopping integrals are taken equal to @xmath8 and restricted to nearest neighbors .",
    "@xmath9 labels _ only _ the existing nearest - neighbors of site @xmath7 after introducing @xmath10 vacancies at random positions .",
    "ideal leads of width @xmath11 are attached at both ends of the sample through hopping integrals equals to @xmath8 and enter in the hamiltonian eq.([tb ] ) as complex self - energies @xcite . the landauer formalism @xcite is employed to calculate the conductance for each realization of disorder .",
    "open boundary conditions are imposed in the direction transverse to conduction .",
    "the present model of disorder has chiral ( particle - hole ) symmetry .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ 1 ] , where we plot the dos as a function of the energy @xmath12 for a wire of @xmath13 and @xmath14 . for comparison",
    "we show the ideal situation ( without vacancies ) and when the concentration of vacancies is @xmath15 . in both cases ,",
    "the chiral symmetry is manifested in the symmetry of the spectrum with respect to the @xmath0 energy axis .",
    "the conductance of a quantum wire of width @xmath11 which supports @xmath16 open channels , @xmath17 connecting the incoming mode @xmath18 at the entrance lead with the outgoing mode @xmath19 in the exit lead .",
    "therefore for a perfect wire with no vacancies it is well known that the dimensionless conductance @xmath20 increases in one unit when a new incoming channel is opened . for @xmath16",
    "open channels is @xmath21 , and at the band center @xmath22 .    in the following",
    "we will perform conductance calculations as a function of the vacancy concentration @xmath23 .",
    "we will focus on the results at the band center ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "this is the special energy value for which anomalies in the conductance have been reported in the random hopping model of disorder @xcite .",
    "we will obtain an analytical formula that reproduces quite satisfactory the behavior of the mean conductance as a function of the vacancy concentration for quasi - one dimensional wires and also for wide wires in which @xmath25 .      here",
    "we present conductance calculations for quasi - one dimensional wires where @xmath26 .",
    "averages over configurations of disorder have been performed to obtain the mean conductance , that unless other specification we will denote for simplicity with the symbol @xmath27 .",
    "the total number of vacancies for each concentration is @xmath28 .",
    "we start analyzing the effect of @xmath29 vacancy on the conductance . due to the fact that the perfect wire has translation symmetry along the longitudinal direction ( @xmath30 )",
    ", the wire with one vacancy has inversion symmetry along this direction with respect to a transverse line that contains the vacancy .",
    "therefore the wave functions of the system with one vacancy can be written as linear combinations of products of plane waves along the direction of conduction and functions with a node in the site of the vacancy in the the transverse direction to conduction ( along the @xmath31 line that contains the site of the vacancy ) .",
    "then , due to the chiral symmetry , the number of active transverse modes at energy @xmath0 is determined by the number of independent solutions of the isolated vertical line that contains @xmath32 sites .",
    "it is exactly @xmath32 .",
    "therefore the value of the conductance is reduced in one unit with respect to the value in the clean wire .",
    "that is @xmath33 , where the subscript refers to the number of vacancies and it is understood that @xmath34 .",
    "if a second vacancy is added at the same @xmath35 than the first one but at a different coordinate @xmath36 , the number of transverse modes remains the same as in the case of one vacancy .",
    "therefore the conductance at @xmath0 is still @xmath32 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the second vacancy is put at the same @xmath36 coordinate than the first one , but at a different @xmath35 coordinate , the number of transverse channels is reduced by two with respect to the value in the clean case .",
    "therefore the conductance at @xmath0 would be @xmath37 .",
    "for any other spatial location of the second vacancy , the separability among the transverse and longitudinal modes is lost .",
    "this implies that the conductance will not be @xmath38 an integer number any more . in order to have an insight about how the conductance is modified in a generic situation",
    ", we will keep in mind that the effect of a single vacancy in a clean wire is to cut exactly one channel regardless the spatial location of the vacancy in the sample .",
    "alternatively , we could calculate the ( mean)conductance of a wire with only one vacancy as the sum of the individual conductances of @xmath11 single channel conductors , each one with a * mean conductance * of @xmath39 .",
    "this gives @xmath40 , as we previously obtained .",
    "in the following to compute the conductance we imagine the wire as composed of single - channel conductors in parallel .",
    "this approximation neglects interference effects among the different transverse channels when vacancies are added and relies in the fact that the wire is quasi - one dimensional ( _ i.e. _ the energy separation between transverse modes is very large ) . the effect of the second vacancy will be to suppress exactly one channel in a  clean wire \" composed by w single channel conductors , each one with a * mean conductance * of @xmath39 .",
    "therefore the conductance for @xmath41 can be calculated as the sum of the conductances of @xmath32 single channel conductors each one with an average conductance of @xmath42 .",
    "this gives @xmath43 .",
    "following this simple scheme up to @xmath2 vacancies we obtain    @xmath44    where we have replaced in the right hand side @xmath45 in order to show explicitly the exponential decay of the mean conductance with the length of the sample .    therefore , from eq.([gmedia1 ] ) one concludes that the quasi - one dimensional wire with @xmath2 vacancies could be model as @xmath11 single channel conductors in parallel , each one with an average conductance of @xmath46 .    in the left ( right ) panel of fig .",
    "[ 2 ] we show @xmath27 as a function of the vacancy concentration @xmath23 for a wire of width @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the solid line in both panels shows the exponential law , eq.([gmedia1 ] ) , that follows accurately the numerical results ( dots ) for an ample range of values of @xmath23 .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the localization properties of this model do not depend on the parity of the number of transverse channels as it happened in the random hopping model studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an analytical estimate of the localization length @xmath49 can be obtained from eq.([gmedia1 ] ) , @xmath50 which in the limit of @xmath51 gives @xmath52 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that only one vacancy suffices to suppress the conductance of a one - dimensional wire , that is @xmath53 for @xmath54 , as we have previously obtained .",
    "moreover , when @xmath55 , that is when @xmath56 , the conductance becomes lower than one , in agreement with eq.([gmedia1 ] ) and the model of w independent channels .    in the limit",
    "@xmath57 is @xmath58 . when @xmath26 , it is satisfied that the mean free path @xmath59 and the localization length @xmath49 are related by @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath61 , as expected for quasi - one dimensional samples .      when the aspect ratio of the sample @xmath62 increases interference effects between the transverse channels become relevant .",
    "therefore the conductance can not be calculated as a sum of the conductances of one - dimensional wires . as a consequence",
    "one should expect that eq .",
    "( [ gmedia1 ] ) departs from the numerical results when the aspect ratio @xmath63 .",
    "as was already mentioned , when vacancies are added at arbitrary locations in the sample , the wave functions can not be written as products of functions of the longitudinal coordinate by functions of the transverse coordinate .",
    "disorder mixes the transverse and longitudinal modes and then the separability is lost .    when the first vacancy is added , exactly one channel is suppressed .",
    "this is the maximum suppression possible when a site is eliminated and it is due to the fact that the `` one vacancy problem '' is separable , as was already discussed .",
    "however , due to the mixing between channels , when a new vacancy is added that maximum value is not attained and less than one channel is effectively eliminated . therefore the efficiency of the vacancies for decreasing the conductance is reduced .    in a classical picture",
    "the carriers can now propagate following non rectilinear paths along the direction of conduction , avoiding the obstacles ( vacancies ) .",
    "therefore , even after including the rescaling of the mean conductance per channel each time a new vacancy is added ( as it was done when we obtained eq.([gmedia1 ] ) ) , the actual conductance for a given value of @xmath23 should be greater than the value predicted by the pure exponential decay eq .",
    "( [ gmedia1 ] ) .    taking into account the effect described above",
    ", we propose for wide wires the following ansatz for the mean conductance as a function of @xmath23 ,    @xmath64    with @xmath65 . for @xmath66 or @xmath67 , @xmath68 and the pure exponential decay predicted in eq.([gmedia1 ] )",
    "is reobtained .    in fig .",
    "[ 3 ] we show the conductances as a function of @xmath23 for three different samples with @xmath69 and @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the aspect ratios are @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively .",
    "it is clear that even for relatively small concentrations , the pure exponential formula eq.([gmedia1 ] ) departs from the numerical results . on the other hand eq.([gmedia2 ] ) gives a quite satisfactory fit to the numerical results even for large concentrations ( see the caption in fig.[3 ] ) .",
    "however , there is a critical value of the concentration above which the conductance falls abruptly towards @xmath74 .",
    "fig.[4 ] shows in a log - lin plot the numerical values for the mean conductance together with those predicted by eq.([gmedia2 ] ) for two samples with @xmath69 and @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively . in both plots , and in spite of the numerical fluctuations ,",
    "the fall of the conductance towards @xmath74 is clearly observed .",
    "the suppression of the conductance is a signature of the presence of ultra - localized states formed by effect of the vacancies at @xmath77 .",
    "these ultra - localized states correspond to eigenstates of the disorder isolated @xmath78 stripe which persist even after the system is embedded with the leads ( _ i.e. _ these eigenstates extend along a distance @xmath79 ) .",
    "to illustrate this point , we evaluate the dos for a wire ( stripe with leads ) and two values of the concentration @xmath23 , below and above the critical value ( @xmath80 ) respectively . in order to put in evidence the existence of ultra - localized states , we include in the computation of the dos a small imaginary part @xmath81 , such that @xmath82 .",
    "the small quantity @xmath81 does not modify the dos when ultra - localized states are absent ( remember that we are computing the dos for an open system ) . on the other hand , when the ultra - localized states exist",
    ", a single pole in the dos will appear at @xmath77 .",
    "it corresponds to a peak with a height that increases linearly with @xmath83 as @xmath84 .",
    "figure [ 5 ] shows the dos as a function of the energy @xmath12 , @xmath85 , for a wire of @xmath86 and @xmath87 and two concentrations @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( @xmath90 for this sample ) .",
    "the peak in the dos at @xmath0 for @xmath91 is the signature of the presence of ultra - localized states which are trapped in finite regions of the sample defined by the spatial distribution of the vacancies .",
    "it should be remarked that it is not necessary that the vacancies enclose completely the region in which the state is trapped , as it was already noted in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is worth to mention that the smooth part of the dos ( that is obtained with @xmath92 ) at @xmath0 has a dip but it is not zero , showing the coexistence of ultra - localized states and generic states at the same energy . as the conductance falls down to zero for concentrations @xmath93",
    ", they should be spatially disconnected ( indeed the extended states must necessary come from the leads ) .",
    "therefore when ultra - localized states are formed , the transport across the wire is forbidden .",
    "as the aspect ratio of a sample increases , the value of @xmath80 around which the transition takes place also increases .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that interference effects between longitudinal and transverse channels ( which are maximized for the square geometries ) favors the conduction along the sample .    for @xmath94 , that is before the transition towards the suppression of the conductance occurs , the non - pure exponential law eq.([gmedia2 ] ) implies that , unlike the quasi one - dimensional wires , it is not possible to define a localization length in the usual way ( _ i.e. _ as the inverse of the decay rate in the exponential law for the conductance as a function of the length @xmath95 ) .",
    "in this work we study the localization properties of disorder quantum wires . disorder is simulated distributing vacancies at random positions in the sample and thus preserving the chiral symmetry .",
    "conductance calculations at @xmath0 have been performed as a function of the concentration of vacancies @xmath23 , in quasi - one dimensional and in wide wires , respectively .    for quasi - one dimensional wires we have shown that the conductance decays with the length of the wire following an exponential law irrespective of the parity in the number of transverse channels .",
    "this is at odd with previous results reported for the random hopping model of disorder in which the scaling of the conductance at the band center would depend on the parity of the number of transverse channels @xcite .      for wide wires and low values of @xmath23 a pure exponential decay of the mean conductance with the length",
    "@xmath95 has been also observed .",
    "this exponential localization is consistent with the quantum percolation transition predicted for the binary - alloy model in 2d lattices at @xmath96 @xcite ( all the states are exponentially localized for any amount of disorder in a 2d lattice ) .",
    "therefore , in an infinite system , only one vacancy is enough to suppress the conductance .",
    "however for wide wires and greater values of @xmath23 , we found that the conductance decays following a non pure exponential law .",
    "we have proposed an ansatz , eq.([gmedia2 ] ) , that takes into account how interference effects between channels affect the conductance of the sample as the concentration @xmath23 increases . if from eq.([gmedia2 ] ) we define @xmath97 this quantity could be interpreted as a localization length that depends on the finite dimensions of the wire .    finally , a new abrupt transition to the suppression of the conductance is observed when the concentration of vacancies @xmath23 goes beyond some critical value @xmath80 ( which is indeed sample dependent ) in a finite system .",
    "this transition , which is a signature of the formation at @xmath0 of ultra - localized states trapped in finite regions of the sample , can be also interpreted as the quantum analog of the classical cluster percolation transition ( cpt ) .",
    "classically , the cpt and the suppression of the conductivity occurs at the same critical concentration @xcite . in a quantum system",
    "they could be separated due to the fact that ultra - localized states could be formed in an infinite cluster for a finite value @xmath98 .",
    "the ultra - localized states are poles at @xmath0 of the dos , even after the leads are included , and therefore should be spatially separated from any other extended state of the leads .",
    "we should mention that ultra - localized states at @xmath0 have been already reported for the binary alloy model in isolated samples by kirkpatrick and eggarter @xcite .",
    "in addition , we do not observe in the dos a signature of the presence of ultra - localized states out of the band center when the leads are included .",
    "in an infinite 2d quantum system the conductance is suppressed as soon as a single vacancy is introduced , so the conductance is not a relevant magnitude to detect the * quantum * cpt .",
    "however , as in a finite quantum system there is not a complete suppression of the conductance for finite values of @xmath23 , the conductance can be employed to estimate the critical concentration for the * quantum * cpt .",
