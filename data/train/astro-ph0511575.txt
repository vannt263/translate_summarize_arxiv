    "zinc telluride ( czt ) is rapidly coming of age as a detector material for photons from a few kev to a few mev .",
    "it offers superior spatial and energy resolution compared to scintillators ; and it is more economical and compact compared to ge , particularly considering that czt does not require cryogenic cooling .",
    "+ czt is a compound semiconductor , with a band gap between 1.5 and 2.2 ev , depending on the zn / cd fraction .",
    "this band gap allows room - temperature operation .",
    "its high average z of 50 and high density contribute to effective stopping of photons .",
    "one of its limitations is a poor hole mobility @xmath5 and trapping .",
    "advanced electrode designs , including pixilation , crossed strips , and steering electrodes , mitigate this by virtue of the `` small pixel effect '' @xcite .",
    "the best energy resolutions are achieved by combining small - pixel detector designs with corrections for any residual dependence of the induced signals on the depth of the interaction ( doi ) of the primary photons . in practice",
    ", the doi can be estimated by measuring the timing delay between cathode rise and anode rise , @xcite , or from the anode to cathode signal ratio ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    since the use of small anode contacts leaves gaps to which charge can drift and escape collection @xcite , steering grids biased somewhat below anode potential",
    "have been used to steer the charges to the anodes .",
    "figure [ potential ] shows the results from a 3-d detector simulation and illustrates the potential distribution in such a detector when the grid is biased at -300  v relative to the pixels .",
    "czt detectors with steering grids encounter two difficulties .",
    "first , the surface resistivity of czt is much lower than the bulk resistivity ( @xmath610@xmath7 ohm cm ) and the grid bias voltage gives rise to currents between the steering grids and the pixels .",
    "the noise associated with these currents may deteriorate the energy resolution of the detectors .",
    "second , for grid bias voltage much lower than the cathode bias voltage , a considerable fraction of electric field lines inside the detector connect to the steering grids .",
    "thus , biased in this way steering grids tend to collect some of the charge generated in the detectors and tend to reduce the detection efficiency of the detectors . here",
    "we explore a novel approach that uses steering grids that are isolated from the czt bulk material by a thin isolation layer ( fig .",
    "[ layer ] ) . in the following we briefly outline our technique of fabricating the detectors",
    "; subsequently we describe our measurement equipment and the results from testing the detectors with flood illumination and with a collimated x - ray beam . in the following ,",
    "all energy resolutions are full width half maximum ( fwhm ) resolutions .",
    "the studies use modified horizontal bridgeman czt from the company orbotech @xcite .",
    "we fabricated several detectors . on some we used the in pixels deposited by the orbotech .",
    "on others we deposited the pixels ourselves using e - beam evaporation through a mask .",
    "the results shown in the following are from detector `` d1 '' with pixels deposited by orbotech and an isolated steering grid deposited in our laboratory .",
    "the detectors have a volume of 2.0@xmath22.0@xmath20.5  @xmath3 and are contacted with a planar in cathode and 8@xmath28 in pixels with a pitch of 0.25  cm and a pixel width of 0.16  cm . after evaluating the performance of the detectors ,",
    "the isolated steering grids were deposited using standard photolithographic techniques .",
    "we used the photoresist s1813 and the developer cd-30 from the company shipley @xcite .",
    "we optimized the processing parameters based on a series of empirical tests varying the prebake and softbake temperatures and durations , the exposure time , and the development time .",
    "the optimization has been carried through at washington university in st .",
    "louis and at fisk university . after protecting the pre - deposited pixels with photoresist ,",
    "first a 150 nm thick isolation layer , and subsequently a 200 nm thick grid were deposited at @xmath610@xmath8 torr with an electron beam evaporator .",
    "we used al@xmath0o@xmath1 as isolation material because of its very high resistivity ( @xmath9 ohm cm ) , and excellent mechanical properties .",
    "almost any metal with good sticking properties could be used for the steering grid .",
    "we chose ti because of its low price and relative ease with which it can be deposited .",
    "the thickness of the isolation layer has still to be optimized .",
    "the width of the steering grid is approximately 0.02  cm .",
    "figure [ gridsmallbwn ] shows one of our detectors with a steering grid .    2.0@xmath20.5  @xmath3 czt detector with steering grid .",
    "a high - resistivity al@xmath0o@xmath1 film isolates the steering grid from the czt substrate.,width=170 ]      several setups have been used to test the performance of the detector . at washington university the pixel performance of three of the central pixels",
    "are measured by using flood illumination with a @xmath4cs source .",
    "the setup reads out four channels ( the three central anode pixels plus the cathode , all other anode pixels are grounded ) that are ac coupled to fast amptek 250 amplifiers followed by a second amplifier stage .",
    "the amplified signals are digitized by a 500 mhz oscilloscope and transferred to a pc via ethernet .",
    "the time resolved readout enables us to measure the drift time of electrons through the detector with a resolution of 10 ns .",
    "each event gets a time stamp .",
    "a fit of an exponential to a histogram of the times between successive events after deadtime correction , is used to calculate the detection rate .",
    "care was taken to locate the source always at the same location above the detector , so that the measured rates can be used to estimate the detection efficiency of the detectors .",
    "the detector is mounted by using gold plated pogo - pins to contact the anode , the steering grid and the cathode .",
    "the cathode is negatively biased , and the anode pixels are held at ground .",
    "the steering grid was biased at -30  v , -60  v , @xmath10  v and -200  v. the electronic noise of our test set - up has been measured before each detector evaluation and lies between 5  kev and 10  kev .",
    "we used a keithley picoammeter to measure cathode - pixel , steering grid - pixel , and pixel - pixel iv curves .",
    "a more detailed description of the test - equipment as well as previous results on orbotech detectors have been given in @xcite .",
    "at the university of california in san diego the detector response has been studied with a collimated gamma - ray source .",
    "the 7.5 cm thick tungsten collimator has a tapered hole .",
    "the hole diameter is 0.02 cm at the source and 0.05 cm at the detector end of the collimator .",
    "the czt cathode is 0.10 cm away from the collimator .",
    "the collimator position is controlled by a x - y stage with 1@xmath11 m accuracy .",
    "eight channels can be read out , the information obtained is the pulse height of the signals .",
    "the fwhm noise of anode channels lies between 5.75  kev to 8.1  kev for cathode biases between @xmath12  v and @xmath13  v and grid bias between @xmath14  v and @xmath10  v. the fwhm noise of the cathode channel lies between 7.2  kev and 41  kev . more information on the experimental set - up as well as previous results can be found in @xcite .      in the following ,",
    "we report on the results obtained with detector d1 .",

    "were observed . comparing these results to pixel - pixel iv measurements of detectors without a steering grid , we observe that the al@xmath0o@xmath1 layer results in a substantial current suppression .    figure [ energyresolution ] shows the 662  kev energy resolution of the three central pixels for flood - illuminating the detector with a @xmath4cs radioactive source . before depositing the steering grid , the three pixels gave energy resolutions of 2.10% , 2.03% and 1.85% . biasing the steering grid at -30  v ,",
    "the performance of the same three pixels improved to 1.69% , 1.49% and 1.39% , respectively .",
    "the energy resolutions changed little for steering grid voltages between 0  v and -200  v. for biases @xmath15 - 200  v , the detector performance deteriorated significantly .",
    "before and after deposition of the steering grid , we obtained detection rates that are identical within the statistical errors .",

    "the scan with a step size of 0.125 cm started at the center of one pixel and ended at the center of an adjacent pixel .",
    "the detector pixels were held at ground , the cathode was biased at -500  v , and the steering grid at -60  v. the electronic noise for the anode and cathode channels was 7  kev and 20  kev , respectively . here",

    ". we measured the percentage of events with a sharing ratio between @xmath1610% and @xmath1590% using a cut on the sum of the two pixel signals ( @xmath17 channels ) . with the collimator centered at pixel 1",
    "this fraction of events with substantial charge sharing was @xmath610% , at the position ( 0 mm , 0.5 mm ) @xmath625% and in the middle between the pixels @xmath640% ( fig .",
    "[ a1vsa2]b ) .",
    "we examined the same data in more detail .",
    "the sum of the anode signals of pixels  1 and 2 was plotted as a function of the cathode signal for the collimated beam pointing at the center of pixel 1 ( fig .",
    "[ sumanodevscathode]a ) and at the location between pixels 1 and 2 ( fig .",
    "[ sumanodevscathode]b ) .",
    "only signals which exceed a threshold of 120 channels were included in the analysis . the different colors in fig .",

    "when the collimator was pointed at the region between the two pixels , three different populations contribute to the photo - peak event line .",
    "the events with approximately no charge sharing ( red ) ( in the following called line 1 ) exhibit a similar anode to cathode dependency as the events taken when the collimated beam pointed at the center of pixel 1 ( fig . [ anode1andsum ] ) .",
    "most events with sharing ratios between 4%-10% and 90%-96% exhibit relatively small cathode signals and the summed anode signals lie above the ones with no charge sharing on a line , called `` line 2 '' in the following . for the events with charge sharing ratios between 10% and 90% , the photo - peak line ( `` line 3 '' )",
    "is shifted to lower summed anode values . in the following",
    ", we refer to the three photopeak lines in fig .",
    "[ sumanodevscathode ] as lines 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "line 3 shows a strong dependency on the depth of interaction . a possible explanation is lost charge in the gap / steering grid region .",
    "the charge loss depends on the depth of interaction @xcite . after energy deposition in the detector",
    "the electrons undergo diffusion . neglecting the electron charge ,",
    "the diffusion can be described by the fick s equation @xmath18 .",
    "( d is the diffusivity , for czt @xmath626 @xmath19/s ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the one dimensional solution for the concentration m(x , t ) at position x and time t for a delta function initial concentration m@xmath20 at position @xmath21 is @xmath22 .",
    "if one makes a rough estimate , that all events at line 3 interact in the middle of the gap and that a region of 18@xmath11 m exactly between the pixels , steals charge from the signal , line 1 can be reproduced . to fully understand this effect ,",
    "further investigations are needed .",
    "detailed simulations and measurements are planned .",
    "events with small sharing ratios ( 4%-10% and 90%-96% ) are mostly found in line 2 .",
    "these are probably events interacting near the anode side and near the pixel edges . in this area",
    ", a signal can be induced in the adjacent pixel that increases the summed signal .",
    "because the different lines are dependent on the sharing ratio , this is an effect which can be corrected for . in fig .",
    "[ correct ] the spectra for the collimator position at anode 1 and for the collimator position at the gap between anode 1 and anode 2 is shown .",
    "both spectra are corrected for the effect mentioned above .",
    "the obtained energy resolutions are 1.7% at anode 1 and 2.1% at the gap .",
    "+ one remainig question is the behaviour of the summed anode signal vs. cathode signal as a function of different grid biases . for biases equal to the pixel voltage and for a grid - bias of -30  v",
    "the number of charge sharing events is strongly suppressed compared to a grid - bias of -60  v. the number of events in the region between 2560 channels and 3200 channels ( the photopeak range ) are 1062 , 1846 and 2910 for bias 0  v , -30  v and -60  v respectively .",

    "the results are extremely encouraging : the al@xmath0o@xmath1 layer seems to reduce the grid - pixel currents and the steering grid seems to improve the energy resolution of the detector by a factor of 1.3 .",
    "while the grid biased at -30  v did not reduce the detection efficiency , when using only the information from one pixel . using the information from adjacent pixels by summing their signals",
    ", the steering grid even increases the number of events reconstructed in the photopeak .    with the aim to achieve a good understanding of the performance of the detector with and without steering grids ,",
    "we have started to scan the detector response with a collimated x - ray beam .",
