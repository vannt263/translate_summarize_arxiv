    "the discovery of a significant quasi - periodic oscillation in the x - ray light curve of a narrow line seyfert 1 agn re j1034 + 396 ( gierliski et al . 2008 ) strengthens arguments stressing the similarities in the physics of the accretion flow between supermassive and stellar mass black holes .",
    "previous evidence for a simple correspondence between agn and the black hole binaries ( bhb ) included similarities in the broadband shape of the x - ray variability power spectra , with characteristic break timescales scaling with mass ( e.g. m@xmath0hardy et al .",
    "2006 ) , but the characteristic qpos often seen in bhb light curves remained undetected until now ( vaughan & uttley 2005 ; leighly 2005 ) .",
    "the qpos in bhb can be split into two main groups , at high and low frequencies , respectively . while there is as yet no clear mechanism for producing either set of qpos ( or the correlated broad band variability ) there are many pointers to their origin from the observations .",
    "most clearly , their amplitude increases with increasing energy .",
    "the bhb spectra typically contain two components , a disc and tail , and this increasing amplitude is consistent with the qpo ( and all the rest of the rapid variability ) being associated with a variable tail while the disc remains constant .",
    "this shows that qpos are produced by some mode of the hot coronal flow rather than a mode of the thin disc .",
    "( see e.g. the reviews by van der klis 2004 ; mcclintock & remillard 2006 ; done , gierliski & kubota 2007 ) .",
    "the rest of the qpo properties are more complex . the high frequency ( hf ) qpo may have a constant fundamental frequency ( though it is seen at 3:2 harmonic ratios of this ) , which may relate to the mass of the black hole .",
    "by contrast , the frequency ( and other properties ) of the low frequency ( lf ) qpo change dramatically with mass accretion rate , correlating with the equally dramatic changes in the source spectra .",
    "typically these show that at low mass accretion rates compared to eddington , @xmath1 , the lf qpo is at low frequencies , but is weak and rather broad .",
    "the corresponding energy spectra are dominated by a hard power law ( photon index @xmath2 ) which rolls over at around 100 kev ( low / hard spectral state ) . as the mass accretion rate increases , the low frequency qpo increases in strength and coherence as well as frequency , while the power law spectrum softens and the disc increases in strength relative to the power law .",
    "the qpo is at its highest frequencies , is strongest and most coherent where the spectrum has both a strong disc component and a strong soft tail of emission to higher energies ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "after this , the lf qpo frequency remains more or less constant as the tail declines and hardens to @xmath4 , leaving the spectra dominated by the disc component ( high / soft state ) , though it becomes harder to follow the qpo as increasing contribution from the stable disc ( thermal dominant state ) swamps the signal from the variable tail .",
    "( e.g. mcclintock & remillard 2006 and references therein )    the only major difference expected in scaling these models up to the supermassive black holes in agn is the decrease in disc temperature down to the uv band .",
    "the x - ray spectra of agn spectra should then be always dominated by the tail , irrespective of spectral state ( e.g. done & gierliski 2005 ) .",
    "the predicted change in shape of the tail with spectral state / mass accretion rate gives an explanation for the variety of spectral properties seen in _ unobscured _ subtypes agn such as broad line agn , narrow line seyfert 1 s ( nls1 ) and liners ( e.g. middleton et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the generally hard x - ray spectra seen in liners could be explained as a low @xmath5 flow ( e.g. yuan et al .",
    "2008 but see maoz 2007 ) , while broad line agn with a strong uv disc component and weak x - ray @xmath6 tail would be analogous to the high / soft state in bhb .",
    "the nls1 probably have the highest mass accretion rates , so have lower mass for a given luminosity ( boroson 2002 ) , and their steeper x - ray spectra ( brandt , mathur & elvis 1997 ; leighly 1999 ; shemmer et al . 2006 )",
    "make them natural counterparts for the very high state ( pounds , done & osborne 1995 ; murashima et al .",
    "2005 ; middleton et al .",
    "2007 , m@xmath0hardy et al .",
    "2007 ) where all qpos ( both high and low frequencies ) are strongest .",
    "intriguingly , re j1034 + 396 is a nls1 , so its qpo detection is consistent with these scaling models .",
    "all this supports models where the underlying physics of the accretion flow is very similar between bhb and agn .",
    "however , the scaling clearly breaks down under more detailed study of the x - ray spectra from high mass accretion rate objects .",
    "these should have spectra dominated by the steep tail which is typical of the high and very high states , with no disc emission in the x - ray band . yet",
    "_ all _ the high mass accretion rate agn show an excess below  1  kev ( gierliski & done 2004 ; brocksopp et al .",
    "this soft x - ray excess is completely inconsistent with the expected disc component , both as its temperature is higher than predicted from the mass and mass accretion rate of these agn ( e.g. bechtold et al .",
    "1987 ) , and as its shape is much smoother than a sharply peaked disc spectrum ( czerny et al . 2003 ; gierliski & done 2004 ) .",
    "either the soft x - ray excess is an additional component which breaks the scaling between agn and bhb , or it is produced by some external distortion of the intrinsic emission .",
    "obviously it is very important to distinguish between these alternatives and the objects with the strongest soft excesses offer the most stringent constraints .",
    "re j1034 + 396 has one of the largest soft excesses known , which appears to connect smoothly onto the enormous euv peak of its spectral energy distribution ( middleton et al .",
    "the size and temperature of this peak is extreme even amongst nls1 s ( puchnarewicz et al .",
    "2002 , casebeer et al .",
    "2006 ; middleton et al .",
    "2007 ) , and an obvious question is whether this extreme soft excess is somehow linked to the detection of the qpo .",
    "here we use xmm - newton data on re j1034 + 396 to test the various models for the soft x - ray excess , and speculate on its connection to the qpo .",
    "there are multiple models for the origin of the soft x - ray excess seen ubiquitously in high mass accretion rate agn .",
    "the most obvious possibility is that it is related somehow to the disc .",
    "one way to do this is if the mass accretion rate is super eddington , so the disc spectrum is distorted by advection of radiation in the very optically thick flow .",
    "such slim discs ( abramowicz et al . 1988 ) have spectra which are less peaked than a standard disc ( waterai et al .",
    "2000 ) so give a better fit to the shape of the soft excess ( mineshige et al .",
    "2000 ; wang & netzer 2003 ; haba et al . 2008 ) . another way to modify",
    "the shape of the ( standard or slim ) disc emission is if it is comptonized by low temperature electrons ( czerny & elvis 1987 ; kawaguchi 2003 ) , perhaps produced by a hotter skin forming over the cooler disc ( czerny et al . 2003 ) .",
    "however , the derived temperature for this skin is remarkably similar for all objects at 0.10.2  kev despite a large range in black hole mass ( and hence disc temperature : czerny 2003 ; gierliski & done 2004 , crummy 2006 ) .",
    "this argues against it being related to the disc , so it is unlikely to be a true continuum component .    instead",
    ", a constant energy is most easily explained through atomic processes , in particular the abrupt increase in opacity in partially ionized material between @xmath70.72 kev due to ovii / oviii and fe transitions .",
    "this results in an increase in transmitted flux below 0.7  kev , which could produce the soft excess either from absorbtion in optically thin material in the line of sight , or from reflection by optically thick material out of the line of sight . in both models",
    "the observed smoothness of the soft excess requires large velocity smearing ( velocity dispersion @xmath80.3 c ) in order to hide the characteristic _ sharp _ atomic features , but with this addition then both reflection and absorption models fit the shape of the soft excess equally well ( fabian 2002 , 2004 ; gd04 ; crummy 2006 ; chevallier 2006 ; schurch & done 2006 ; middleton et al .",
    "2007 ; dewangan et al .",
    "2007 , dammando et al . 2008 ) .",
    "such high velocities are naturally produced only close to the black hole , so both absorption and reflection models predict that the soft excess arises in regions of strong gravity .",
    "however , both models also require some extreme , and probably unphysical , parameters . in the reflection model ,",
    "the inferred smearing can be so large that the required emissivity must be more strongly centrally peaked than expected from purely gravitational energy release , perhaps pointing to extraction of the spin energy itself .",
    "the amount of reflection required to produce the soft excess can also be extreme .",
    "quasi- isotropic emission sets a limit to size of the soft excess of no more than a factor of 23 above the harder continuum emission ( sobolewska & done 2007 ) , yet the strongest observed soft excesses are a factor @xmath9 larger than this ( a factor @xmath10 above the extrapolated continuum ) , requiring that the intrinsic illuminating spectrum is strongly suppressed ( _ e.g. _ fabian 2002 ) .",
    "this issue becomes even more problematic when incorporating any pressure balance condition ( such as hydrostatic equilibrium ) as this strongly limits the section of the disc in which partially ionized material can exist , hence makes a much smaller soft excess ( done & nayakshin 2007 ; malzac , dumont & mouchet 2005 ) .",
    "conversely , in the smeared absorption model , pressure balance rather naturally produces the required partially ionized zone ( chevallier et al .",
    "however , these models also imply extreme velocities , with a peak outflow velocity of @xmath7  0.8c required in order to smooth away the characteristic absorption features from a smooth wind which covers the source ( schurch & done 2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "this is much larger than the maximum velocity of @xmath7  0.2 - 0.4c produced by models of a radiation driven disc wind ( fukue 1996 ) , so the absorber must instead be associated with faster material in this description .",
    "the obvious physical component would be a jet / magnetic wind , yet the amount of material is probably far too large to be associated with either of these ( schurch & done 2007 ; 2008 ) .",
    "thus there are physical problems with all of these models : the comptonized disc can not explain the narrow range in inferred temperatures , smeared reflection can not produce the strongest soft excesses seen if the disc is in hydrostatic equilibrium , and smeared absorption requires a fast wind / jet which is not readily associated with the properties of any known component .",
    "an alternative possibility for the absorption model is that the characteristic absorption features are masked by dilution instead of smearing , perhaps due to the wind becoming clumpy so that it partially covers the source ( boller et al .",
    "1996 ; tanaka et al .",
    "2004 ; miller et al . 2007 ; 2008 ) .",
    "these models lack diagnostic power as the potential complexity of the wind means that any number of partial absorbers can be added until the model fits the observed spectra .",
    "nonetheless , this may correspond to the more messy reality of high eddington fraction winds from uv luminous discs ( proga & kallman 2004 ) .",
    "some of the clumps could even have high enough column to produced significant reflected emission as well ( malzac et al . 2005 ; chevallier et al . 2006 ) , giving a complex mix of reflection and partial absorption from a range of different columns , velocities and ionization states of the material .",
    "it is important to distinguish between these very different potential origins of the soft excess as they make very different predictions about the environment and geometry of the accreting material close to the black hole .",
    "the extreme broad iron lines required in the pure reflection models are not required in the absorption models ( either smeared : sobolewska & done 2007 ; done 2007 or partial covering : miller et al . 2008 ) as the broad feature redwards of the iron line is fit instead by continuum curvature .",
    "all the absorption models require the presence of material above the inner disc , probably in the form of a wind , whereas the reflection models instead suggest a clean line of sight to the inner disc .",
    "the large velocity shear in the smeared wind model requires that the material is strongly accelerated , so it potentially carries an enormous amount of kinetic energy ( chevallier et al .",
    "2006 ; schurch & done 2006 ) with corresponding impact on agn feedback / galaxy formation .",
    "spectral fitting alone can not distinguish between these very different spectral models in the 0.310 kev bandpass ( crummey et al .",
    "2007 ; sobolewska & done 2007 ; middleton et al .",
    "2007 ; miller et al . 2007 ; 2008 ) .",
    "variability gives additional information , but the smeared reflection and smeared absorption models are known to be able to predict similar variability patterns ( ponti et al . 2005 ; gierliski & done 2006 ) .",
    "here for the first time we fit _ all _ of these models to the data and calculate their predicted variability to see which description of the soft excess best matches the _ simultaneous _ constraints from both spectral and variability data .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ observed re j1034 + 396 on 2007 - 05 - 31 and 2007 - 06 - 01 for about 93 ks ( observation i d .",
    "0506440101 , revolution no .",
    "we extracted source and background light curves and noticed background flares and data gaps in the final  7 ks .",
    "therefore , we excluded this data segment from analysis and used 84.3 ks of clean data starting on 2007 - 05 - 31 20:10:12 utc for further analysis .",
    "we selected data from the pn ( patterns 04 ) and mos ( patterns 012 ) in a region of radius 45 arcsec .",
    "the data are very similar in shape to a previous 16 ks xmm - newton observation , but are much higher quality due to the longer exposure . because of the extreme softness of this particular source both mos and pn were piled up so we excised the central regions of the image out to 7.5 arcsec radius so as not to be affected by this .",
    "background was taken from 6 source free regions of the same size .",
    "we use only the mos data in the 0.310  kev range for spectral fitting as there are well known discrepancies at soft energies between the pn and mos spectra which makes simultaneous fitting of these two instruments very difficult .",
    "we use xspec version 11.3.2 , and fix the minimum galactic absorption at @xmath11@xmath12 in all fits , but also allow a separate neutral absorption column to account for additional absorption in the host galaxy .",
    "a successful model must be able to describe _ both _ the spectrum _ and _ the variability .",
    "[ fig : lc]a shows the full light curve for these data , with the clear qpo which is remarkably coherent in the latter part of the observation ( 2585 ks : g08 ) .",
    "there is also a large scale drop in flux at 4055 ks .",
    "this looks very similar to an occultation event such as those recently recognised in other agn ( mckernan & yaqoob 1998 ; gallo et al . 2004 ; risaliti et al . 2007 ;",
    "turner et al .",
    "[ fig : lc]b shows the light curve in the high energy bandpass , where this dip is _ not _ present .",
    "this shows that there is clearly energy dependent variability in this event which is not present in the rest of the light curve .",
    "thus the variability is _ complex _ and made from more than one component .",
    "l    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "any viable model for the soft excess must simultaneously fit both the spectrum and spectral variability with the same model parameters .",
    "the spectra alone can be fit with a variety of continua .",
    "there is clear curvature but this is degenerate .",
    "the spectra can either be fit with low energy spectral curvature , together with a ( @xmath13 ) power law at high energies , or with a steep power law at low energies ( @xmath14 ) together with curvature at high energies from emerging reflected ( ref2 ) or absorbed components ( ionpcf2 ) , or by a somewhat less steep power law ( @xmath15 ) with curvature around 0.72  kev from absorption in a rapidly accelerating wind ( swind ) .",
    "however , the energy dependence of the rapid x - ray variability ( which is dominated by the qpo in these data ) breaks these degeneracies .",
    "the rms spectrum over the whole observation shows a smooth rise with energy , initially appearing to favour models where there is a single variable component ( pivoting power law ) which forms the spectrum .",
    "however , this rms is made up from two quite dissimilar variability patterns for the short and long timescales .",
    "both these contain clear changes in the rms at @xmath16  kev , with the rapid variability amplitude strongly increasing with energy at this point while the longer timescale variability strongly decreases .",
    "these combine together in such a way as to produce an apparently featureless overall rms .",
    "the rms of the rapid variability clearly supports the spectral decomposition where the soft excess is a separate , low temperature comptonization component ( comp ) .",
    "the variability drops just where the low temperature compton component starts to dominate , so the rms shape is easily produced from models where the soft excess remains constant and simply dilutes the variability of a high energy power law tail .",
    "this is very similar to the sorts of spectral decompositions used in binary systems , where the qpo ( and all other rapid variability ) is associated with the tail , not with the disc .",
    "by contrast , the alternative spectral models ( where the soft excess is an artifact of some distortion on an intrinsic steep power law spectrum ) have much more difficulty in matching the energy dependence of the rapid variability .",
    "pivoting the steep intrinsic power law at the peak energy of the seed photons gives a linearly rising rms , so some additional assumptions are required to produce the observed faster drop in variability at low energies . changing the ionization of the absorber in the smeared wind model ( swind ) gives enhanced variability in the 0.72  kev region which matches well to the shape of the rms at low energies .",
    "however , this then drops above 2  kev where ionization changes no longer affect the spectrum , which does not match the observed rms .",
    "by contrast , both the double reflector ( ref2 ) and double partial covering model ( ionpcf2 ) have ionized components at low energies , so holding these constant while the rest of the spectrum responds to the pivoting power law dilutes the low energy variability . however , physically this seems somewhat contrived , and both these ( but especially ionpcf2 ) have difficulties in suppressing enough variability at the lowest energies .",
    "c    thus the combined spectral and spectral variability constraints strongly favour the model where the soft excess is a true continuum component , described by a low temperature comptonized disc component ( comp ) .",
    "the long timescale variability can also be explained in this spectral decomposition by changing the temperature and/or optical depth of the comptonization to give a predicted rms which matches the data very well .",
    "however , the light curve shows that there can also be discrete energy dependent events ( the dip ) , which seems more likely to be from an occultation .",
    "if so , then there should also be some contribution from absorption in the spectrum , and this might also shape the longer timescale variability .",
    "this decomposition of the x - ray spectrum into a comptonized disc with separate tail to high energies ( comp ) also looks sensible in the light of the overall spectral energy distribution . both the uv / euv / soft x - ray shape and the rms variability of the x - ray emission show that this peaks at @xmath17  kev ( puchnarewicz et al .",
    "2000 ; casebeer et al .",
    "2006 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : rms ] ) . integrating the comp model down to this energy",
    "gives a luminosity of @xmath18 ergs s@xmath19 .",
    "this is already more than 10 per cent of the bolometric luminosity of @xmath20 ergs s@xmath19 .",
    "however , in the reflection and partial covering models , ref2 and ionpcf2 , the observed soft x - ray flux is only a small fraction of the total illuminating power law .",
    "the hidden emission required by both these models is a factor @xmath21 larger .",
    "this luminosity must be reprocessed , yet is more than the total bolometric luminosity of the source !",
    "thus these two models fail on energetics as well as requiring somewhat contrived assumptions in order to match the rms variability and requiring an uncomfortably steep ( @xmath22 ) intrinsic continuum .",
    "this all strongly supports the conclusion that in re  j1034 + 396 the soft excess is a comptonized disc component , connecting smoothly onto the euv peak of the spectral energy distribution and extending out to @xmath23  kev .",
    "this does not have an obvious counterpart in the typical black hole binary systems .",
    "these can show convincingly clean disc spectra ( thermal dominant state , high / soft state , ultrasoft state ) , or higher temperature comptonization ( 1020  kev : very high state , intermediate state , steep power law state ) , but generally they do not show low temperature comptonization ( see e.g. done , gierliski & kubota 2007 ) .",
    "however , most of these systems have @xmath24 , so they may not be a good guide to the spectra of super eddington flows .",
    "the disc structure should change at such high mass accretion rates , with strong winds potentially increasing the amount of material in the corona , leading to mass loading of the acceleration mechanism and decreasing energy per particle .",
    "whatever the origin , a similar process of low temperature disc comptonization probably happens in the unique galactic black hole binary grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "this is the only black hole binary in our galaxy which consistently shows super eddington luminosities ( done , wardziski & gierliski 2004 ) , and it can show spectra which are dominated by a huge , low temperature comptonized disc component , with a weak power law tail to higher energies . fig .",
    "[ fig:1915 ] shows how one of these spectra from grs  1915 + 105 ( the low @xmath25 state in fig .",
    "7 of zdziarski et al .",
    "2005 ) fits almost exactly onto the xmm - newton spectrum of re j1034 + 396 with a shift in energy scale by a factor 20 .",
    "this gives a mass estimate for re j1034 + 396 of @xmath26m@xmath27 from scaling the disc temperature as @xmath28 , which seems quite reasonable ( puchnarewicz et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "understanding the origin of the soft excess in re  j1034 + 396 may not necessarily solve the problem of the soft excess in general .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of this object is plainly rather different from that in most other high mass accretion rate agn in that the soft excess contains a large fraction of the bolometric luminosity of the source ( middleton et al .",
    "spectral distortion models ( reflection or absorption ) are clearly more likely to explain a feature carrying only a small fraction of the bolometric luminosity .",
    "instead , the continuous euv / soft x - ray excess in re  j1034 + 396 clearly favours a common origin for the disc and soft excess , unlike that for most other quasars , where the uv and soft x  rays do not appear to smoothly connect to each other in individual objects ( haro - corzo et al .",
    "the combined constraints from the spectrum and variability show the soft excess in re j1034 + 396 is most likely a smooth extension of the accretion disc peak in the euv probably arising from low temperature comptonization of the disc .",
    "this remains more or less constant on short timescales , diluting the qpo and rapid variability seen in the power law tail at the low energies where the soft excess dominates .",
    "as in the black hole binary systems , the qpo is a feature of the tail _ not _ of the disc .    the conclusion that the soft excess is a low temperature comptonization of the disc emission may not necessarily be more widely applicable to other nls1 .",
    "the spectrum of re  j1034 + 396 is unique , so extrapolating results from this object may not be justified . in particular , if this object has a very high ( super eddington ? ) mass accretion rate then it could enter a new accretion state ( perhaps analogous to the unique galactic binary grs 1915 + 105 and the ultra luminous x - ray sources : roberts 2008 ) which may also be the trigger for its so far unique qpo .",
    "a different origin for the soft excess in re  j1034 + 396 has the advantage that it would not require some unknown physical mechanism to restrict the temperature of the continuum in all objects to a narrow range ( gierliski & done 2004 ) , though does require a coincidence that this temperature in re  j1034 + 396 is so close to that ubiquitously seen for the soft excess .",
    "nonetheless , it is clearly possible that in selecting the most extreme soft excess object , we have also selected the one where the the soft excess has a different origin ."
