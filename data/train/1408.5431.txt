    "the three body problem is one of the most fascinating topics in mathematics and celestial mechanics . the basic definition of the problem is as follows : three point masses ( or bodies of spherical symmetry ) move in space , under their mutual gravitational attraction ; given their initial conditions , we want to determine their subsequent motion .",
    "like many mathematical problems , it is not as simple as it sounds .",
    "although the two body problem can be solved in closed form by means of elementary functions and hence we can predict the quantitative and qualitative behaviour of the system , the three body problem is a complicated nonlinear problem and no similar type of solution exists .",
    "more precisely , the former is integrable but the latter is not ( if a system with n degrees of freedom has n independent first integrals in involution , then it is integrable ; that is not the case for the three body problem ) .",
    "one issue that is of great interest in the three body problem , is the stability ( and instability ) of triple systems .",
    "the stability ( and instability ) of triple systems is an intriguing problem which remains unsolved up to date .",
    "it has been a subject of study by many people , not only because of the intellectual challenge that poses , but also because of its importance in many areas of astronomy and astrophysics , e.g. planetary and star cluster dynamics .    in this work ,",
    "we review the three body stability criteria that have been derived over the past few decades .",
    "we deal with the gravitational non - relativistic three - body problem and we concentrate on hierarchical triple systems . by hierarchical , we mean systems in which we can distinguish two different motions : two of the bodies form a binary and move around their centre of mass , while the third body is on a wider orbit with respect to the binary barycentre",
    ". this may not be the most strict definition of a hierarchical triple system ( e.g. see eggleton and kiseleva 1995 ) , but we use that one in order to cover as many triple system configurations as possible .",
    "we would also like to point out that some of the criteria may apply to systems that are not hierarchical or they are marginally hierarchical ( e.g. wisdom s criterion for resonance overlap ) , according to the definition given in the previous paragraph .",
    "however , as they are related to other criteria that refer to hierarchical systems , we felt that we should mention them too .",
    "there are two main types of stability criteria , depending on how they were derived : analytical and numerical . following that classification",
    ", we are going to present the analytical criteria first and then we will discuss the criteria that have been derived from numerical integrations .",
    "finally , we present criteria that are based on the concept of chaos .    throughout the next paragraphs",
    ", we decided that it would be better if we kept the notation that each author used ( with a few exceptions for the benefit of the reader ) .",
    "the derivation of analytical stability criteria in the three body problem has been dominated by the generalisation of the concept of surfaces of zero velocity of the restricted three - body problem , first introduced by hill ( 1878a,1878b,1878c ) .",
    "it is known that in the circular restricted three body problem , there are regions in physical space where motion can and can not occur .",
    "these regions are determined by means of the only known integral of the circular restricted problem , the so called jacobi constant .",
    "this notion has been extended to the general three body problems by several authors : golubev ( 1967 , 1968a , 1968b ) , saari ( 1974 ) , who used an inequality similar to sundman s , marchal and saari ( 1975 ) , who used sundman s inequality , bozis ( 1976 ) , who used algebraic manipulations of the integrals of motion in the planar three body problem , zare ( 1976 , 1977 ) , who made use of hamiltonian dynamics ; saari ( 1984 , 1987 ) , who produced the best possible configurational velocity surfaces. also , sergysels ( 1986 ) , derived zero velocity surfaces for the general three dimensional three body problem , by using the method of bozis ( 1976 ) and a rotating frame that does not take into account entirely the rotation of the three body system .",
    "finally , ge and leng ( 1992 ) produced the same result as saari ( 1987 ) , using a modified version of the transformation given in zare ( 1976 ) .",
    "easton ( 1971 ) , tung ( 1974 ) and mialni and nobili ( 1983 ) also discussed the topology of the restrictive surfaces .    the quantity @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the angular momentum and @xmath2 is the energy of the three body system , controls the topology of the restrictive surfaces and it is the analog of the jacobi constant of the circular restricted problem .",
    "szebehely ( 1977 ) and szebehely and zare ( 1977 ) , using two body approximations , produced an expression for @xmath0 , which involved the masses , the semi - major axes and the eccentricities of the system .",
    "then , that expression was compared with the critical value @xmath3 at the collinear lagrangian points , which determine the openings and closings of the zero velocity surfaces .",
    "if the value of @xmath0 for a given triple configuration was smaller than the one at the inner lagrangian point , then there could be no exchange of bodies , i.e the system was hill stable .",
    "although there was some discussion on the effect of the inclination , the derivation was for coplanar orbits .",
    "marchal and his collaborators ( marchal and saari 1975 , marchal and bozis 1982 ) , produced a generalisation of the hill curves to the general three dimensional three body problem by using the quantity @xmath4 as the controlling parameter of the restrictive surfaces , where @xmath5 is the mean quadratic distance , @xmath6 is the mean harmonic distance and they are defined by the following equations : @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the distance between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "walker et al .",
    "( 1980 ) derived the critical surfaces in terms of the parameters @xmath13 with @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is the distance between @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the distance between the centre of mass of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and @xmath19 ) .",
    "@xmath20 measures the disturbance of @xmath19 by the binary , while @xmath21 is a measure of the disturbance of the binary by @xmath19 .",
    "thus , for a given triple configuration , they evaluated the @xmath22 quantities and determined whether the system was hill stable or not .",
    "walker and roy ( 1981 ) investigated the effect that the eccentricities had on the stability limit , as the walker et al .",
    "( 1980 ) derivation applied only for coplanar , initially circular and corotational triple systems .",
    "they paid particular attention to the initial orbital phases of the system and they found that the critical value of @xmath23 ( @xmath24 being the semi - major axis ratio of the two orbits ) could be affected by up to @xmath25 .",
    "similar work was also done in valsecchi et al .",
    "( 1984 ) , but instead of using two body expressions for the angular momentum and energy of the system as walker et al .",
    "( 1980 ) did , they used the exact expressions ; however the disagreement between the two methods was very small .",
    "this was also confirmed by kiseleva et al .",
    "( 1994b ) , who used the exact expressions for the angular momentum and energy to evaluate @xmath26 ( the critical initial semi - major axis for the szebehely - zare criterion ) .",
    "they found that their value was always larger by at most @xmath27 compared to the one obtained by two body approximations .",
    "roy et al . ( 1984 ) computed the distance of the closest approach of @xmath17 to @xmath19 for a coplanar , corotational , hierarchical three body system ( with @xmath28 for the inner binary ) and derived a condition for stability by manipulating the angular momentum and energy integrals .",
    "they ended up with the following inequality :    @xmath29[\\mu\\frac{(1-\\mu)^{2}}{1-k}+\\frac{\\mu\\mu_{3}}{k}+ \\frac{\\mu_{3}(1-\\mu)^{2}}{1-k\\mu}]^{2},\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 @xmath31 is defined by the relation @xmath32 ( @xmath15 and @xmath18 are the magnitudes of the two jacobian vectors of the hierarchical triple system ) and it represents the distance of closest approach of @xmath17 to @xmath19 .",
    "if there exists a dynamical barrier between @xmath17 and @xmath19 , then , there will be values of @xmath31 for which inequality ( [ roy1984 ] ) will not be satisfied .",
    "the largest of these values will give the measure of the closest approach of the two orbits .",
    "their result was in agreement with the @xmath0 criterion .",
    "the concept of hill type surfaces that pose restrictions to the motion of three body systems , has also been used to study the motion in special cases .",
    "szebehely ( 1978 ) , in the context of the circular restricted three body problem , derived a simple condition for a satellite to remain in orbit around the smaller primary in presence of the perturbations of the larger one .",
    "the condition is : @xmath33 @xmath15 being the radius of the satellite circular motion around its primary @xmath17 and @xmath34 .",
    "the above condition is valid for both prograde and retrograde motion .",
    "markellos and roy ( 1981 ) obtained a more accurate result for the same problem : @xmath35+o(\\mu)\\ ] ] for prograde orbits and @xmath36+o(\\mu)\\ ] ] for retrograde orbits , where @xmath37 corresponds to @xmath38 of szebehely ( 1978 ) and again , @xmath34 .    walker ( 1983 ) investigated the hill - type stability of a coplanar , with initially circular orbits , hierarchical three body system , where the total mass of the binary was small compared to the mass of the external body ( e.g. satellite - planet - star ) .",
    "his results were in good agreement with szebehely ( 1978 ) and markellos and roy ( 1981 ) .",
    "donnison and williams ( 1983 , 1985 ) used the @xmath0 condition to determine the hill stability of coplanar hierarchical three body systems with @xmath39 ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 form the inner binary ) . using two body approximations for the angular momentum and the energy of the system and taking advantage of the fact that one of the masses was much greater that the other two , they concluded that their system was stable ( in terms of exchange ) when the following condition was satisfied : @xmath40 where @xmath41 @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the semi - major axes of the inner and outer orbit respectively ; the plus sign corresponds to prograde motion , while the minus sign to retrograde motion.finally , @xmath44 is the largest of either inner or outer eccentricity .",
    "donnison ( 1988 ) , using the same approach mentioned above , investigated the stability of low mass binary systems moving on elliptical orbits in the presence of a large third mass , i.e. @xmath45 .    brasser ( 2002 ) dealt with systems where @xmath17 was smaller that the other two masses , which were of comparable size ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 form the inner binary ) .",
    "gladman ( 1993 ) , based on the work done by marchal and bozis ( 1982 ) , produced analytical formulae for the critical separation @xmath46 that two planets @xmath16 and @xmath17 , orbiting a star @xmath19 , should have in order to be hill stable .",
    "he derived the following formulae ( to lowest order ) :    \\(i ) for initially circular orbits @xmath47 ( ii ) equal mass planets , small eccentricities @xmath48 @xmath49 ( iii ) equal mass planets , equal but large eccentricities @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the eccentricities of the inner and outer orbit respectively .    veras and armitage ( 2004 ) , generalising gladman s result , derived a criterion for two equal mass planets on initially circular inclined orbits to achieve hill stability .",
    "they found that the planets were hill stable if their initial separation was greater than    @xmath56+ ... ,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath19 is the mass of the star , @xmath59 is the mass of the planets and @xmath60 the inclination of the orbits .    finally , in a series of papers , donnison ( 1984a , 1984b , 2006 ) made use of the @xmath0 criterion to determine the stability of triple systems , where the outer body moved on a parabolic or hyperbolic orbit with respect to the centre of mass of the other two bodies .",
    "the first two papers dealt with coplanar systems , while the latest one examined systems with inclined orbits . in each paper , there was discussion about some special cases ( equal masses and large @xmath16 in paper i , equal and unequal binary masses in paper ii , equal masses , unequal binary masses , @xmath16 large in paper iii ; in all cases @xmath16 belonged to the inner binary ) .",
    "the main disadvantage of the @xmath0 criterion is that it is a sufficient but not a necessary condition for stability .",
    "exchange might not occur even when the condition is violated but it certainly can not occur when the condition is satisfied .",
    "the lobes could also be open to infinity , but the bodies may or may not escape to infinity .",
    "finally , things are not clear again when the third body is started outside ( inside ) the lobes , since the criterion can not give any information whether the third body will escape or not from the system ( will keep orbiting the binary or form a binary with one of the other masses ) .    the situation where one member of a triple system escapes to infinity was investigated by several authors .",
    "they derived sufficient conditions for the motion to be of hyperbolic - elliptic type , i.e. conditions for the distance between one body and the centre of mass of the two other bodies to increase indefinitely as time goes to infinity , while the distance between the other two bodies remains bounded .",
    "such conditions can be found in standish ( 1971 ) , yoshida ( 1972 ) , griffith and north ( 1973 ) , marchal ( 1974 ) .",
    "yoshida ( 1974 ) derived another criterion for hyperbolic - elliptic motion under the condition that the magnitude of the angular momentum of the three body system was above a certain level and bozis ( 1981 ) , in a paper closely related to the one of yoshida ( 1974 ) , he considered conditions for the smallest mass of a triple system to escape to infinity . finally , a stronger escape criterion has been proposed by marchal and his collaborators ( marchal et al .",
    "1984a , 1984b ) .",
    "references to criteria before 1970 , can be found in the above mentioned papers .    usually , those criteria required that the distance @xmath61 and radial velocity @xmath62 of the potential escaper ( with respect to the barycentre of the binary formed by the other two bodies ) were above certain values at some time @xmath63",
    ". however , for large distances @xmath5 , there is little difference between the criteria ( anosova 1986 ) .",
    "it should also be added here , that , in addition to the sufficient conditions for escape of one body , some of the above mentioned authors also gave sufficient conditions for ejection without escape ; in such a situation , the ejected mass reaches a bounded distance and falls back toward the other two masses .",
    "such conditions can be found in standish ( 1972 ) , griffith and north ( 1973 ) and marchal ( 1974 ) .",
    "the numerical work involves a wide range of simulations of triple systems .",
    "several authors set up numerical experiments and investigated the orbital evolution of hierarchical triple systems .",
    "harrington ( 1972 , 1975 , 1977 ) , in a series of papers , carried out numerical integrations of hierarchical triple systems with stellar and planetary mass ratios . in his first paper , he integrated equal mass systems with different initial conditions in order to determine their stability .",
    "he considered a system to be stable if there had been no change in the orbital elements during the period of integration , particularly in the semi - major axes or the eccentricities .",
    "the following situations were also defined as unstable : escape of one body , collision , i.e. two components got sufficiently close that it could be assumed that there were tidal or material interactions between the bodies involved , change to which bodies comprise the inner binary .",
    "a total of 420 orbits were integrated for 10 to 20 revolutions of the outer orbit .",
    "it was found that stability was insensitive to the eccentricity of the inner binary , for moderate eccentricity , to the argument of periastron of either orbit and to the mutual inclination of the two orbits ( except when the inclination was within a few degrees of a perpendicular configuration ) . as a measure of stability",
    ", he used the quantity @xmath64 ( @xmath65 was the outer periastron distance and @xmath42 the inner semi - major axis ) and he found that stability existed above @xmath66 for prograde and @xmath67 for retrograde orbits . in his second paper ,",
    "harrington integrated coplanar systems with unequal masses ( with the largest mass ratio never exceeding @xmath68 ) and based on his numerical results , he derived the following limiting condition for stability : @xmath69\\log{[1+m_{3}/(m_{1}+m_{2})]},\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the outer periastron distance , @xmath71 is the inner semi major axis and @xmath72 is the parameter limit for equal masses .",
    "the above condition was improved in the last of the three papers , in which harrington performed numerical simulations for systems which consisted of a stellar binary and a body of planetary mass ( equation [ harr1 ] does not apply in this case ) .",
    "the new empirical condition for stability was ( regardless of which of the components the planet was ) : @xmath73+k.\\ ] ] @xmath74 and @xmath75 were determined empirically , with @xmath74 being the limit on @xmath64 for the equal mass case and it was taken directly from the results of the first paper and @xmath75 was then determined by a least square fit to the unequal mass cases ; @xmath76 is @xmath77 if this is to be a mean fit and is approximately @xmath78 if it is to be an upper limit .",
    "for coplanar prograde orbits , @xmath79 and @xmath80 and for retrograde , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "harrington also found that retrograde orbits were more stable than the prograde ones , a result which is in contrast with szebehely s and zare s predictions , as they found that prograde orbits were more stable than retrograde orbits .",
    "however , the results for equal masses and direct orbits were in good agreement , although szebehely s results allow a slightly closer outer orbit . of course , it should be borne in mind that the @xmath0 criterion is a sufficient stability condition , based on the possibility of exchange of bodies .",
    "it should also be pointed out that the definition of stability given by harrington is a bit ambiguous .",
    "he classifies a triple system as stable if there is no `` significant change '' in the orbital elements during the period of integration , and particularly in the semi - major axes and eccentricities .",
    "another point that raises some concern is that the integrations were performed for only 10 or 20 outer orbital periods .",
    "this could prove inadequate , although harrington suggested that instabilities of this kind ( exchange etc . )",
    "set in very quickly .",
    "graziani and black ( 1981 ) , in the context of planet formation and extrasolar planets , used numerical integrations to model planetary systems ( star and two planets , which had the same mass in most of the numerical simulations ) with prograde , coplanar and initially circular orbits .",
    "the systems were integrated for at least 100 revolutions of the longest period planet , or until instability was evident .",
    "the authors classified a system as unstable if there was clear evidence for secular changes in any of the orbits during the numerical integration .",
    "based on their results , they obtained the following condition for stability : @xmath83 where the planets @xmath16 and @xmath17 orbit the star @xmath84 .",
    "the parameter @xmath85 gives the minimum initial separation between the companions in units of their mean distance from the central star , while @xmath86 is the mean mass of the two companions in units of the mass of the star .",
    "more specifically , @xmath87 with @xmath88 and @xmath89 being the semi - major axes of the inner and outer orbit respectively .",
    "systems with @xmath90 became unstable within a few tens of planetary orbits .",
    "black ( 1982 ) modified the above condition to apply for @xmath91 .",
    "the modified stability condition is : @xmath92 both the above stability conditions were confirmed by more integrations ( pendleton and black 1983 ) .",
    "however , equations ( [ black1 ] ) and ( [ black2 ] ) were in disagreement with equation ( [ harr2 ] ) , except a narrow range around @xmath93 .",
    "donnison and mikulskis ( 1992 ) produced a modified version of equations ( [ black1 ] ) and ( [ black2 ] ) , based on numerical integrations of circular , coplanar and prograde systems .",
    "a system was considered to be unstable when there was a change of more than @xmath94 in either of the semi - major axes or / and either of the eccentricities altered by more than 0.1 .",
    "each numerical model was integrated for at least 1000 inner binary orbits or until the existence of instability was evident ( which usually happened within the first 100 orbits ) .",
    "they derived the following values for @xmath95 : @xmath96 and @xmath97 donnison and mikulskis ( 1994 ) , following the same procedure as above , produced the following formulae for @xmath95 in the case of retrograde orbits : @xmath98 and @xmath99 the results of donnison and mikulskis ( 1992 , 1994 ) were in good agreement with the results of black and his collaborators ( for prograde orbits of course ) , but quite different from harrington s results , except in the equal mass case .",
    "there was also agreement with the theory of szebehely and zare ( 1977 ) , but only for prograde orbits .",
    "dvorak ( 1986 ) investigated the stability of p - type orbits in stellar binary systems , i.e. planet orbiting the binary system , in the context of the elliptic restricted three body problem .",
    "he performed numerical integrations of planets on initially circular orbits orbiting an equal mass binary system .",
    "the integration time span was 500 binary periods and a planetary orbit was classified as stable if its eccentricity remained smaller than @xmath100 throughout the whole integration time .",
    "his results showed a region of stability far away from the primaries , a region of instability closer to the primaries and a chaotic ( in the sense of unpredictability ) zone between those two regions .",
    "this chaotic zone was limited by the lower critical orbit ( lco ) , defined as the largest unstable orbit for all starting positions of the planet , and the upper critical orbit ( uco ) , defined as the orbit with the smallest semimajor axis for which the system was stable for all starting positions .",
    "a least squares parabolic fit to the numerical integration results yielded : @xmath101 where @xmath50 is the eccentricity of the primaries and the distance is given in au .",
    "each coefficient is listed along with its formal uncertainty . although the above formulae were derived for systems where the primaries had equal masses , additional numerical integrations of p - type orbits in systems with unequal mass primaries ( dvorak et al .",
    "1989 ) showed no dependence of the critical orbits on the mass ratio of the primaries .",
    "finally , concerning p - type orbits , pilat - lohinger et al .",
    "( 2003 ) investigated the stability of such orbits in three dimensional space .",
    "they integrated initially circular planetary orbits in equal mass binary systems , with a binary eccentricity varying from 0 to 0.5 .",
    "the mutual inclination of the orbits was in the range @xmath102 .",
    "the orbits were classified as in dvorak ( 1986 ) , i.e. stable , chaotic and unstable , where stable meant that the planet did not suffer from a close encounter with one of the primaries for the whole integration time span ( 50000 periods of the primaries ) .",
    "it turned out that the inclination did not affect the stability limit significantly .",
    "rabl and dvorak ( 1988 ) , by using numerical integrations , established stability zones for s - type orbits in stellar binary systems ( planet orbiting one of the stars of the binary system ) .",
    "the setup of their systems was similar to the one in dvorak ( 1986 ) , i.e. initially circular orbit for the massless particle and equal mass primaries .",
    "the maximum binary eccentricity considered was 0.6 .",
    "an initially circular s - type orbit was classified as stable , if it remained elliptical with respect to its mother primary during the whole integration time of 300 periods of the primary bodies .",
    "based on their results , they derived the following formulae : @xmath103 where @xmath50 is the eccentricity of the stellar binary .",
    "note that the meaning of lco and uco is different compared to the p - type orbit case ( the stable orbits lie inside lco , while the unstable ones outside uco ) . as in dvorak ( 1986 ) , the results showed the existence of a grey ( chaotic ) area between lco and uco .",
    "pilat - lohinger and dvorak ( 2002 ) performed more numerical experiments on s - type orbits .",
    "their models took into consideration varying binary mass ratios ( @xmath104 ) and , besides a varying primary eccentricity , the planetary mass had an eccentricity from 0 to 0.5 .",
    "the integration time was 1000 binary periods .",
    "they found that an increase in the eccentricities reduced the stability zone ( the planetary eccentricity had less influence than the binary eccentricity , but it reduced the stability zone in a similar way ) .",
    "the results were also in agreement with the results of rabl and dvorak ( 1988 ) .",
    "however , a quick inspection of the result tables in pilat - lohinger and dvorak ( 2002 ) , may suggest that the primary mass ratio has an effect on the stability zones , in contrast to what was mentioned above in the case of p - type orbits .",
    "holman and wiegert ( 1999 ) , also investigated the stability of p - type and s - type orbits in stellar binary systems .",
    "they performed numerical simulations of particles on initially circular and prograde orbits around the binary or around one of the stars , in the binary plane of motion and with different initial orbital longitudes .",
    "the binary mass ratio was taken in the range @xmath105 and the binary eccentricity in the range @xmath106 .",
    "the integrations lasted for @xmath107 binary periods .",
    "if a particle survived the whole integration time at all initial longitudes , then the system was classified as stable . using a least squares fit to their data",
    ", they obtained : ( i ) for the inner region ( s - type orbit ) : @xmath108a_{b } \\label{hol1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( ii ) for the outer region ( p - type orbit ) : @xmath109a_{b } , \\label{hol2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath110 is the critical semi - major axis , @xmath111 is the binary semi - major axis , @xmath50 is the binary eccentricity and @xmath112 . equation ( [ hol1 ] ) is valid to @xmath113 typically and to @xmath114 in the worst case over the range of @xmath115 and @xmath116 , while equation ( [ hol2 ] ) is valid to @xmath117 typically and to @xmath118 in the worst case over the same ranges .",
    "an interesting finding was that , in the outer region , ` islands ' of instability existed outside the inner stable region ; this phenomenon was attributed to mean motion resonances and indicated that there was not a sharp boundary between stable and unstable regions .",
    "it should be mentioned here that equation ( [ hol2 ] ) , as presented in the paper of holman and wiegert , appears not to depend on @xmath111 at all . however , this is probably a misprint , as equation ( [ hol1 ] ) might suggest .",
    "the results of holman and wiegert are in good agreement with the results of dvorak ( 1986 ) and rabl and dvorak ( 1988 ) .",
    "figures 1 demonstrate that agreement .     against binary eccentricity @xmath50 for a particle orbiting the binary .",
    "the top graph is for p - type orbits and the bottom one is for s - type orbits .",

    "1994a , 1994b ) .",
    "the mass ratios were within the range @xmath120 .",
    "a system was classified as stable if it preserved its initial hierarchical configuration during the whole of the integration time span , which was normally 100 outer binary orbital periods , but certain cases were followed for 1000 or even for 10000 outer orbits ( however , it appeared that the longer integration time had little effect on the stability boundary ) .",
    "these numerical calculations were later extended to eccentric binaries , inclined orbits ( from @xmath121 to @xmath122 ) and different initial phases , and an empirical condition for stability was derived ( eggleton and kiseleva 1995 ) :    @xmath123    where @xmath124 is the critical initial ratio of the periastron distance of the outer orbit to the apastron distance of the inner orbit , @xmath125 @xmath124 is related to the critical initial period ratio @xmath126 by the following relation : @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the eccentricities of the inner and outer orbit respectively .",
    "the coefficients of equation ( [ egg1 ] ) were obtained rather empirically , based on the numerical results that the authors had at their disposal . as for the effect of certain characteristics on the stability boundary , such as the orbital eccentricities , it was determined by the examination of a small number of mass ratios that the authors believed to be reasonably representative .",
    "the criterion appears to be reliable to about @xmath130 for a wide range of circumstances , which is not very bad , considering the amount of parameters and the complex nature of the critical surface .",
    "it probably does not work very well in situations where there is a resonance or commensurability , but these are more common in systems with extreme mass ratios ( e.g. star and planets ) , while the intention of the authors ( as stated in their paper ) was to investigate triple systems of comparable masses .",
    "it should be pointed out here that there is a misprint in formula ( [ egg1 ] ) as given in eggleton and kiseleva ( 1995 ) : the sign of the term @xmath131 is plus , while it should be minus ( aarseth 2003 ) .      in the two previous sections",
    ", we presented stability criteria that were derived either analytically or based on results from numerical simulations . in this section , we discuss criteria that are based on the concept of chaos .    wisdom ( 1980 ) , applied the chirikov resonance overlap criterion for the onset of stochastic behaviour ( chirikov 1979 ) to the planar circular restricted three body problem .",
    "he derived the following estimate of when resonances should start to overlap ( the derivation holds for small eccentricities @xmath132 ) : @xmath133 where @xmath134 . by using kepler s third law ,",
    "this can be expressed in terms of the semi - major axis separation as ( murray and dermott 1999 ) @xmath135 where @xmath43 is the semi - major axis of the perturber .",
    "hence , when the particle is in the region @xmath136 , the orbit is chaotic . a similar result to the one of wisdom , was obtained through the use of a mapping , which was based on the approximation that perturbations to the massless body are localised near conjunction with the perturber ( duncan et al .",
    "it was found that @xmath137 which is in agreement with equation ( [ wis ] ) .",
    "mardling and aarseth ( 1999 ) approached the stability problem in a different way , by noticing that stability against escape in the three body problem is analogous to stability against chaotic energy exchange in the binary - tides problem . the way energy and angular momentum",
    "are exchanged between the two orbits of a stable ( unstable ) hierarchical triple system is similar to the way they are exchanged in a binary undergoing normal ( chaotic ) tide - orbit interaction .",
    "having that in mind , they derived the following semi - analytical formula for the critical value of the outer pericentre distance @xmath138 : @xmath139^{\\frac{2}{5}}\\ ] ] where @xmath140 is the mass ratio of the outer binary and @xmath129 is the outer binary eccentricity . if @xmath141 , then the system is considered to be stable .",
    "the above formula is valid for prograde and coplanar systems and it applies to escape of the outer body .",
    "c was determined empirically and it was found to be 2.8",
    ". a small heuristic correction of up to @xmath142 was then applied for non - inclined orbits , to account for the increased stability ( aarseth and mardling 2001 , aarseth 2004 ) . also , as stated in aarseth and mardling ( 2001 )",
    ", the criterion ignores a weak dependence on the inner eccentricity and inner mass ratio .",
    "finally , we should mention here , that , numerical tests have showed that the criterion is working well for a wide range of parameters , but it has not been tested for systems with planetary masses so far ( aarseth 2004 ) , probably because the authors were mainly interested in using the formula in star cluster simulations .",
    "we would like to mention here that , mardling ( 2007 ) has derived a resonance overlap criterion for the general three body problem .",
    "we should point out , that the presence of chaos does not necessarily indicate instability , e.g. see murray ( 1992 ) , gladman(1993 ) .",
    "the reader should also recall the results of dvorak ( 1986 ) and rabl and dvorak ( 1988 ) , with the zones of unpredictability between the stable and unstable orbits .",
    "however , that kind of behaviour appears to depend on various parameters of the system , such as the mass ratios of the system .",
    "for example , mudryk and wu ( 2006 ) , in their study of a planet orbiting one of the components of a stellar binary system , found little evidence of bound chaos near the instability boundary ( except in the case where the perturber is very small compared to the star , i.e. the case discussed by gladman or covered by wisdom s criterion ) and as a result of that , they adopted the boundary of resonance overlap as the boundary of instability .",
    "that appears to be the case with mardling and aarseth too .",
    "a nice discussion in resonances and instability can be found in mardling ( 2001 ) .",
    "we have attempted to collect and present the various criteria that have been derived for the stability of hierarchical triple systems over the past few decades .",
    "tables 1 , 2 and 3 present the various criteria in a rather concise manner .",
    "each table consists of four columns , i.e. the name column , which gives the name of the relative paper(s ) , the model / restrictions column , which gives a brief description of the systems for which the criterion is applicable ( a blank line indicates that the criterion applies to the general case , without any restrictions ) , the stability type column , which states what stability means for a specific criterion and finally the comments column , where we give any extra information we consider important .",
    "table 1 lists the criteria that were derived analytically .",
    "most of them were based on a generalisation of the concept of zero velocity surfaces of the circular restricted three body problem , with the quantity @xmath0 playing the role of the jacobi constant . as stated in the corresponding section ,",
    "the @xmath0 criterion is a sufficient condition and therefore , no conclusion can be drawn when it is violated .",
    "the marchal and bozis ( 1982 ) criterion is a good choice for one who intends to use a criterion from that specific category .",
    "however , depending on the system investigated , the other criteria could also be a useful alternative and even easier to apply .",
    "table 1 also lists sufficient criteria for escape of one of the bodies .",
    "although those criteria are not very useful on their own , because of their nature ( they require some conditions to be satisfied at a moment @xmath63 ) , they could be used as part of a computer code ( e.g. for cluster simulations ) ; however , their sufficient nature is a major disadvantage for that type of use .",
    "table 2 presents criteria that were based on results from numerical integrations . a task that is not particularly easy , as a triple system has many parameters to be taken into consideration ( mass ratios and orbital parameters ) and covering the whole of the parameter space at once is a rather difficult thing .",
    "sometimes the various criteria were in agreement with each other , sometimes they were not .",
    "this can be attributed to many factors .",
    "the main one , in our opinion , is the different meaning that stability may have for different people .",
    "szebehely ( 1984 ) gave 47 different definitions for stability in his dictionary of stability. as the reader has probably noticed , almost each author mentioned in section ( 2.2 ) , gave a different definition of what he considered as stable system .",
    "another issue that raises concern is the integration time span .",
    "a system may appear to be stable for a certain time span , but becomes unstable when the integration is extended over longer timescales .",
    "also , the choice of initial conditions may have an effect on the outcome .",
    "finally , as stated in kiseleva et al .",
    "( 1994a ) , a matter of concern about those criteria is the fact that they involve instantaneous and not mean orbital parameters .",
    "the last two criteria of the table are probably the best from the numerical ones , the eggleton - kiseleva for stellar systems and the holman - wiegert for planets in binary systems ( keep in mind that the planets are on intially circular orbits ) .",
    "we would like to open a parenthesis here and mention that the stability of planets in binary systems is an area of research that is expected to become more and more important in the future , as there is an increasing number of exoplanets that are members of binary or multiple stellar systems ( e.g. see eggenberger et al .",
    "it appears that none of the above mentioned stability criteria , analytical or numerical , can cover the issue on its own .",
    "for instance , the planetary eccentricity is an important parameter not appearing in the criteria , although many exoplanets have eccentric orbits ( of course most of the criteria were developed when none or very few exoplanets had been discovered by that time ) .",
    "therefore , at the moment , one should choose the criterion ( or a combination of different criteria ) that fits the system he investigates better .",
    "finally , table 3 lists criteria that involve the concept of chaos . in that context ,",
    "instability in a three body system was thought to be the consequence of the overlap of sub - resonances within mean motion resonances .",
    "it was also mentioned that the presence of chaos in some cases , would not necessarily indicate instability .",
    "the author wants to thank the institute for materials and processes at the school of engineering and electronics of edinburgh university , where most of this work took place .",
    "the author also thanks the anonymous referees for their useful comments on various aspects of this work .",
