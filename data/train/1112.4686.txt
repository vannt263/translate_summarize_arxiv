    "this is the second of a series of papers ( together with @xcite ) where we propose an extension of the one dimensional renormalization theory for the case of quasi - periodic forced maps .",
    "each of these papers is self contained , but highly interrelated with the others .",
    "an more detailed exposition can be found in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we give the definition of the operator for the case of quasi - periodic maps and we use it to prove the existence of reducibility loss bifurcations when the coupling parameter goes to zero . in this paper",
    "we use the results obtained there to study the asymptotic behavior of these bifurcations when the period of the attracting set goes to infinity .",
    "our quasi - periodic extension of the renormalization operator is not complete in the sense that several conjectures must be assumed . in @xcite",
    "we include the numerical evidence which support our conjectures and we show that the theoretical results agree with the behavior observed numerically . in @xcite",
    "we also include a numerical study of the asymptotic behavior of the reducibility loss bifurcations which will be summarized in the forthcoming section [ sec : num obs ] .",
    "the classic one dimensional renormalization theory provides an explanation to the behavior observed in the cascades of period doubling bifurcations .",
    "concretely , given a typical one parametric family for unimodal maps @xmath2 one observes numerically that there exists a sequence of parameter values @xmath3 such that , the attracting periodic orbit of the map undergoes a period doubling bifurcation . between one period doubling and the next one there exists also a parameter value @xmath4 , for which the critical point of @xmath5 is a periodic orbit with period @xmath0 .",
    "one can also observe that @xmath6    this reveals two important phenomena .",
    "the first one is the self - renormalizable structure of the bifurcation diagram .",
    "since the limit converges , it indicates that there exists a scale factor of @xmath7 between one bifurcation and the next .",
    "the second one is the universality , in the sense that the limit @xmath7 does not depend on the family considered .",
    "renormalization theory provides a theoretical explanation to this phenomenon .",
    "the literature on this topic is quite extensive , some remarkable works are @xcite , we also refer the reader to the books @xcite and references therein .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the analog of renormalization and universality problem for the case of quasi - periodic forced one dimensional maps . in @xcite",
    "we have given numerical evidences of self - similarity of the bifurcation diagram and universality .",
    "these numerical evidences are described in section [ sec : num obs ] below . in this paper",
    "we provide a theoretical explanation to the behavior observed numerically .",
    "consider @xmath8 a two parametric family of quasi - periodic maps in the cylinder @xmath9 , such that it has the form @xmath10 with @xmath11 a diophantine number , @xmath12 and @xmath13 parameters , @xmath14 a periodic with respect @xmath15 and @xmath16 a family of one dimensional maps having a complete cascade of period doubling bifurcations as the family described before .",
    "as before , let @xmath3 be the parameter values where the attracting periodic orbit of the map undergoes a period doubling bifurcation and @xmath17 the values for which the critical point of @xmath5 is a periodic orbit with period @xmath0 .",
    "the paradigmatic example for this type of maps is the forced logistic map ( flm for short ) , where the uncoupled one dimensional family is the logistic map , @xmath18 with @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "nevertheless the results that we obtain are applicable to a wider class of maps .    in @xcite we computed some bifurcation diagrams in terms of the dynamics of the attracting set .",
    "we have taken into account different properties of the attracting set , as the lyapunov exponent and , in the case of having a periodic invariant curve , its period and reducibility .",
    "the reducibility loss of an invariant curve is not a bifurcation in the classical sense , it is only a change in the spectral properties of the transfer operator associated to the curve ( see @xcite ) . despite of this",
    ", it can be characterized as a bifurcation ( see definition 2.3 in @xcite ) and it will be considered as such for the rest of this paper .",
    "the numerical computations in the cited work reveal that the parameter values for which the invariant curve doubles its period are contained in regions of the parameter space where the invariant curve is reducible , as sketched in figure [ esquema bifpar ] .",
    "taking into account the properties of universality and self renormalization of the logistic map , one might look for similar phenomena in the bifurcation diagram of the flm .",
    "let @xmath4 be the parameter value where the critical point of the uncoupled family @xmath2 is periodic with period @xmath0 .",
    "numerical computations ( see @xcite ) revealed that from every parameter value @xmath20 two curves are born .",
    "these curves correspond to reducibility - loss bifurcations of the @xmath0-periodic invariant curve . in @xcite",
    "we proved that these curves really exist under suitable hypotheses .",
    "assume that these two curves can be locally expressed as @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "numerical experiments in @xcite show that the slopes depend on @xmath11 , i. e. @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) , and also show that @xmath25 for the examples studied numerically .",
    "in @xcite we give explicit expressions of this slopes in terms of the quasi - periodic forced renormalization operator , for both @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in this paper",
    "we focus only on @xmath26 , but the discussion for @xmath27 is completely analogous .",
    "the slopes @xmath26 can be used for the numerical detection of universality and self - renormalization phenomena .",
    "if the bifurcation diagram is self renormalizable one should have that @xmath28 converges to a constant .",
    "in general , this is not true due to the fact that when the period is doubled , the rotation number of the system also is",
    ". then one should look for renormalization properties between the bifurcation diagram of the family for rotation number @xmath11 and the bifurcation diagram of the same family for rotation number @xmath29 .",
