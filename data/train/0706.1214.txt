    "currently , several fundamental questions about the low - redshift intergalactic medium ( igm ) require better observational constraints .",
    "what fraction of the ordinary baryonic matter in the universe is located in the igm at the present epoch ?",
    "what are the physical conditions of the intergalactic baryons ?",
    "to what degree have intergalactic gas clouds been enriched with metals , and what are the physical processes that exchange matter and energy between galaxies and the igm ?",
    "interest in the properties of the low - redshift igm is motivated by several broad issues in galaxy evolution and cosmology :    first , theoretical studies indicate that the igm is the primary reservoir of baryons throughout the history of the universe , but the igm is predicted to change from predominantly cool , photoionized gas at high redshifts to a mixture of shock - heated gas , photoionized gas , and condensed objects ( stars ) at low redshifts ( cen & ostriker 1999 ; dav et al .",
    "1999,2001 ; cen & ostriker 2006 ) .",
    "the conversion of a substantial fraction of the igm from cool gas into moderately hot gas could solve the long - standing `` missing baryons problem '' , the fact that the inventory of readily - observed low - z baryonic matter ( e.g. , persic & salucci 1992 ; fukugita et al . 1998 ) falls far short of the quantity expected based on big bang nucleosynthesis and deuterium measurements ( e.g. , omeara et al . 2006 ) and cosmic microwave background observations ( e.g. , spergel et al .",
    "as time passes , gas collects in deeper potential wells .",
    "some of that gas cools and forms stars , but hydrodynamic simulations show that as gas accretes into the potential wells of galaxies and groups / clusters , gravitational shock heating drives much of it into the @xmath18 k temperature range ( cen & ostriker 1999 ; dav et al .",
    "the models indicate that this shocked material is often located in modest overdensity regions outside of galaxies , and it is cooler and less dense than the x - ray emitting hot gas seen in galaxy clusters , hence it has been dubbed the `` warm - hot intergalactic medium '' ( whim ) .",
    "dav et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have analyzed a set of six hydrodynamic cosmological simulations with diverse computational characteristics ( e.g. , different spatial resolutions and box sizes , different numerical methods , and different assumptions about and treatments of physical processes ) , and they find that the simulations all robustly predict that a substantial fraction of the baryons ( @xmath19% ) should be found in the whim at @xmath20 0 ( see also cen & fang 2006 ) .",
    "hydrodynamic cosmological simulations are now being used for a wide variety of purposes , so it is important to test the robust predictions from these simulations with observations .",
    "whim observations are also valuable for this purpose as well as for probing fundamental questions about the physical conditions and distribution of the baryons . in addition , more recent simulations suggest that whim models ( and the very definition of the `` whim '' ) may require refinements .",
    "for example , while the original simulations placed the low@xmath0 missing baryons in the @xmath21 k range , the simulations of kang et al .",
    "( 2005 ) indicate that a significant portion of the whim is heated and ionized by lower - velocity shocks and photoionization and has @xmath14 k. obtaining good constraints on the properties of the whim is now a major observational goal of igm studies .",
    "second , it is becoming increasingly evident that the processes that add or remove gas and energy from galaxies play an important role in galaxy evolution ( e.g. , keres et al . 2005 ; veilleux et al . 2005 ; voit 2005 ) . however , most observational constraints on processes such as gas accretion and feedback via galactic winds are limited to regions relatively close to galaxies .",
    "low - redshift absorption systems in the spectra of quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) can provide detailed information about the physical conditions and chemical enrichment of intergalactic gas farther away from galaxies and thereby provide a more complete view of how matter and energy are exchanged between galaxies and the igm .",
    "for example , observations of nearby star - forming galaxies show a strong relationship between stellar mass and gas - phase metallicity ( e.g. , tremonti et al . 2004 ) that has been suggested to be a result of galactic winds : in the deeper potential wells of more massive galaxies , supernova ejecta are retained , but lower - mass objects lose metals into the igm by the action of galactic winds ( e.g. , mac low & ferrara 1999 ) . but",
    "how much impact does this `` feedback '' from a lower - mass galaxy have on its environment ?",
    "escaping outflows can , in principle , travel substantial distances from the source galaxies .",
    "direct evidence of winds has been found in the immediate vicinity of starbursting and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( veilleux et al . 2005 , and references therein ) , but how large is the `` sphere of influence '' of such galaxies ?",
    "many commonly employed techniques for the study of galactic outflows , e.g. , optical and x - ray emission observations , lose track of escaping material as it flows away from the source , and absorption spectroscopy of star clusters within the galaxies , while highly useful , mainly probes the outflows within a few kpc of the galaxies .",
    "qso absorption lines provide a unique opportunity to probe the lower density material at larger distances away from interesting foreground galaxies .",
    "moreover , many recent papers have considered the possibility that galaxy evolution is affected by feedback from black hole accretion - driven processes in qsos and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) such as qso / agn winds that might develop when significant amounts of matter are driven into the central regions of galaxies ( e.g. , springel et al . 2005a , b ) . the dramatic `` broad absorption line ''",
    "( bal ) qsos ( e.g. , turnshek 1988 ) provide evidence that such outflows exist , and with outflow velocities that often exceed 10,000 km s@xmath13 , bal qsos could propel material to substantial distances and affect a large region surrounding a qso . while it is not clear from observations how much impact bal qsos really have on their surroundings , we do know that bals are relatively common : based on a large sample of qsos from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , trump et al .",
    "( 2006 ) report that 26% of a sample of qsos at @xmath22 1.7 show broad absorption features .",
    "moreover , there is evidence that some _ narrow _ absorption lines arise in qso outflows ( see  [ absclass ] ) , and lower - luminosity agns are also known to drive high - velocity flows ( crenshaw et al .",
    "these observations raise several questions : how many of the absorbers with @xmath2 arise in high - velocity qso / agn outflows ? how do these outflows affect their surroundings ?",
    "are they important sources of feedback , and on what scales ? when using qsos to study the foreground `` ordinary '' igm , we can also simultaneously search for any evidence of narrow absorption lines that arise in qso outflows .",
    "for the last several years , we have used high - resolution ultraviolet qso spectra to study the properties of the intergalactic medium in the nearby universe , galaxy - absorber connections , and the roles played by the igm in galaxy evolution .",
    "we have provided complete surveys of all absorption lines detected on individual qso sight lines ( sembach et al .",

    "these studies have provided clear observational evidence that a substantial fraction of the baryons are in the igm at the present epoch , but many key questions remain open .    in this paper , we employ a larger sample in order to investigate the statistical properties and physical conditions of the low@xmath0 igm . for this purpose",
    ", we present a survey of low@xmath0 absorbers based on high - resolution ultraviolet spectra of sixteen low - redshift qsos observed with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) .",
    "our observations were made with the e140 m echelle mode of stis , which provides excellent spectral resolution ( 7 km s@xmath13 fwhm ) .",
    "moreover , these spectra have good sensitivity for detection of weak absorption lines ; the data are sufficient for detection of lines with rest - frame equivalent widths @xmath23 m  over a substantial path length . consequently , these sight lines provide a unique opportunity to obtain precise and deep measurements of low@xmath0 qso absorbers . for seven of our sight lines ,",
    "we supplement the stis observations with spectra obtained with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ , which extend the spectral coverage farther into the far ultraviolet . in this paper , we present the first results from this survey : we report the measurements of all intervening and proximate absorption - line systems in these spectra with a focus on the statistics and physical conditions of the absorbers .",
    "while our primary interest is in the igm , to assess the issues discussed above , we also compare and contrast the intervening and proximate ( i.e. , @xmath3 ) absorbers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  2 , we present the ultraviolet spectra that we use for the survey , and we discuss the data reduction (  [ uvspecsec ] ) , our procedures for line identifications and measurements (  [ idsec ] and [ secmeas ] , respectively ) , and our classification of the absorbers (  [ classsec ] ) ; we describe in  [ classmulti ] how we distinguish between apparently simple / single - phase absorbers and complex multiphase systems , and in  [ absclass ] we also separate the systems into intervening absorbers or `` proximate '' ( @xmath3 ) cases . a variety of statistics of the intervening and proximate absorbers are reviewed in  3 including the number of absorbers detected per unit redshift (  [ dndzsec ] ) , the column density and doppler parameter distributions of the lines (  [ basicstats ] ) , the correlation ( or lack thereof ) between the column densities and doppler parameters (  [ nbcor ] ) , a detailed comparison of the _ shapes _ of the and lines and the fractions of the absorbers that have well - aligned and profiles (  [ shapesection ] ) , and the correlations of @xmath24 ( ) and @xmath24()/@xmath24 ( ) with @xmath24 ( ) (  [ ratiosec ] ) .",
    "we analyze the physical conditions of the intervening absorbers in  4 . in this section ,",
    "we first derive constraints on the absorber plasma temperatures for components with well - aligned and profiles under the assumption that the good correspondence of the and profile centroids indicates that the and lines arise in the same gas (  [ tempsec ] ) .",
    "we then show that while purely collisionally ionized models work poorly given the implied cool temperatures (  [ collionsec ] ) , models including photoionization are highly consistent with the properties of the well - matched and lines (  [ photoionsec],[hybridsec ] ) . in ",
    "[ complexmulti ] we demonstrate that the complex multicomponent / multiphase absorbers can accommodate warm - hot gas , but additional information is needed to constrain these complex systems .",
    "we also examine in  [ hiddenblasec ] whether the apparently simple and cold absorbers could actually be multiphase systems , including hot collisionally ionized gas , in which the broad absorption expected to go with the hot phase is hidden in the noise .",
    "we find that this is possible if the absorbers are essentially always multiphase systems with the frequently located in a quiescent interface layer on the surface of a cooler phase .",
    "we close with discussion of the implications of our measurements , including comments on the baryonic content of the intervening absorbers and some suggestions for future observations (  5 ) before we summarize the paper in  6 .",
    "the appendix provides comments about individual absorption systems including line identification and problems caused by blending , hot pixels , and saturation . in this work",
    ", we assume the solar oxygen and carbon abundances reported by allende prieto et al .",
    "( 2001,2002 ) : ( o / h)@xmath25 , ( c / h)@xmath26 .",
    "we note that these abundances are currently a topic of debate ( e.g. , basu & antia 2004 ; bahcall et al .",
    "2005a , b ) , and the solar c and o abundances could be @xmath27 dex higher . while important for some questions about low@xmath0 absorbers , this level of uncertainty does not significantly impact the results presented in this paper . in this paper",
    "we also assume @xmath28 = 75 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 , @xmath29 = 0.3 , and @xmath30 = 0.7 .",
    "our survey of low - redshift absorbers is based primarily on high - resolution ultraviolet spectroscopy of qsos acquired with stis .",
    "we only use data obtained with the e140 m echelle mode of stis for two reasons : ( 1 ) this setup provides the best combination of spectral resolution and signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio that can be obtained in practical amounts of _ hst _ time , and ( 2 ) single exposures with this stis mode cover a relatively large wavelength range . stis e140 m observations typically cover the 1150@xmath311730   range with 7 km s@xmath13 resolution ( fwhm ) with 2 pixels per resolution element.6 times larger . ]",
    "the e140 m wavelength scale calibration is excellent : the stis handbook ( kim quijano et al .",
    "2003 ) reports that the relative wavelength scale is accurate to @xmath32 pixels ( @xmath33 km s@xmath13 ) across the full spectral range , and the absolute wavelength calibration is accurate to @xmath34 pixels ( @xmath35 km s@xmath13 ) .",
    "we have occasionally identified slightly larger relative wavelength scale errors ( tripp et al . 2005 ) , but we generally find agreement with the stis handbook wavelength accuracies .",
    "we reduced the stis data using the stis i d team version of calstis at the goddard space flight center . our procedure for reduction of the stis e140 m data is described in tripp et al .",
    "( 2001,2005 ) and includes the two - dimensional echelle scattered light correction ( valenti et al .",
    "2002 ) and the algorithm for automatic repair of hot pixels ( lindler 2003 ) .",
    "warm / hot pixels are a difficult problem suffered by the stis mama detector used in the e140 m mode , and the possible effects of warm / hot pixels must always be borne in mind .",
    "the hot pixel problem often affects several adjacent pixels ( see examples in  [ classmulti ] and the appendix ) , and thus hot pixel `` features '' can have a more severe impact than a single occasional bad pixel . in some cases , the automatic hot pixel repair algorithm successfully corrects hot pixels by interpolation , but many warm / hot pixels are not identified by the algorithm and are evident in the final spectra . up until 2002 august ,",
    "the position of the spectrum on the e140 m mama detector was moved roughly monthly .",
    "this offsetting procedure provides another means to identify and suppress hot pixels : when the stis observations were obtained on multiple dates separated by more than a month ( see table  [ obslog ] ) , hot pixels will only be present in the extracted spectrum in observations obtained on a particular date ( because the spectrum was shifted to a different place on the detector on the other dates ) . by masking and rejecting the pixels in the affected individual exposures obtained at the `` bad '' position , the hot pixels can be suppressed .",
    "of course , this reduces the s / n ratio in the affected region because only a subset of the exposures are coadded in that region , but by judiciously masking a minimum number of pixels in the vicinity of the hot pixel feature , the impact of s / n loss is minimized .",
    "hot pixels are often quite obvious , even in individual exposures",
    ". however , low - level `` warm '' pixels can be difficult to recognize , and many of the qsos were observed on essentially a single date ( i.e. , with the spectrum located at the same place on the detector for all exposures ) or were observed after 2002 august , so unfortunately , in some cases we were unable to mitigate the effect of warm / hot pixel features .",
    "an example of hot pixel supression and comments on hot pixel problems are provided in the appendix .",
    "further information on the design and performance of stis can be found in kimble et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and woodgate et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .    for this survey",
    ", we used two simple criteria to select low - redshift qsos from the stis e140 m archive : ( 1 ) we required the qso redshift ( @xmath11 ) to be greater than 0.15 in order to provide a sufficiently large redshift range that could be searched for the @xmath36 1031.93 , 1037.62 doublet , and ( 2 ) the s / n had to be sufficient to detect lines with rest - frame equivalent width @xmath23 m  over a substantial portion of the redshift range .",
    "these criteria resulted in a sample of 16 low - redshift qsos .",
    "we summarize in table  [ obslog ] some basic properties of the 16 sight lines including @xmath11 , galactic coordinates , and column densities of the galactic and h@xmath37 due to the foreground ism in each direction .",

    "the spectroscopic line - spread function has more prominent broad wings when the @xmath39 is used ( kim quijano et al .",
    "2003 ) , and we take this into account when fitting voigt profiles to the absorption lines ( see below ) . most of the targets in our sample were observed to similar s / n ratios , but there is some s / n variation among the sight lines , and a few of the qso spectra have better s / n ( e.g. , 3c 273.0 and h1821 + 643 ) . for purposes of comparison ,",

    "2003 ; sembach et al .",
    "the stis e140 m wavelength range covers @xmath411031.93,1037.62 doublets with redshifts ranging from @xmath42 out to the redshift of the qso for all 16 qsos .",
    " ; the s / n of the data and the lower redshift limit for which the stis data provide useful coverage of o  vi vary from sightline to sightline depending on the flux of the qso at @xmath43   and the total integration time . ]",
    "the _ fuse _ spectrographs cover the @xmath44   range , and therefore _ fuse _ data can be used to extend the survey to cover all absorbers with @xmath45 .",
    "however , the _ fuse _ bandpass has a high density of lines arising from the milky way ism , particularly molecular hydrogen lines from various rotational levels ( see , e.g. , wakker 2006 ; gillmon et al .",
    "2006 ) , as well as extragalactic lyman series lines and a rich array of ( sometimes unfamiliar ) metal lines ( verner , barthel , & tytler 1994 ) that are redshifted into the _ fuse _ bandpass for extragalactic absorbers .",
    "consequently , one of the lines of the doublet is often blocked by some unrelated line and is unmeasureable .",
    "for this reason , extra caution is warranted with the _ fuse _ spectra because ism and extragalactic lines can be incorrectly identified as redshifted .",
    "we have supplemented our stis survey with _ fuse _ observations , but only for the seven sight lines in the sample for which complete identifications of all lines in the _ fuse _ bandpass have been published , including 3c 273.0 ( sembach et al .",

    "( 3 ) emission features can partially or fully contaminate absorption lines . in the stis spectra",
    ", the `` emission '' features that cause contamination are mainly warm / hot pixels , which can extend across several adjacent pixels and thereby fill in real absorption lines ( see  [ classmulti ] and appendix ) .",
    "some of the hot pixels can be assuaged by the procedures discussed above , but many of the warm / hot pixels are not adequately removed in the fully reduced data . in the _ fuse _ data , airglow emission lines from the earth s atmosphere are present at various wavelengths ( feldman et al .",
    "some of the the airglow lines are excited by sunlight and can be significantly suppressed by using _",
    "fuse _ data recorded on the night side of the orbit only , but this reduces the total integration time and s / n of the final spectrum , and some residual airglow emission features remain in the night - only spectra . in this paper",
    ", we use all of the available _ fuse _ data ( day and night ) in order to maximize the data s / n .    to identify extragalactic absorbers ( and the ancillary lines in their absorption systems ) in a way that considers these issues , we employed a two - pass search procedure :    in the first pass , we searched each spectrum for lines that have the relative wavelength separation and the relative line strengths of the redshifted @xmath361031.93 , 1037.62 doublet . in order to be included in our samples that are used for statistical measurements and physical conditions analyses in the rest of the paper , we required that lines have measured rest - frame equivalent widths ( @xmath52 ) that are recorded at @xmath53 significance or better .",
    "however , for identification of doublets or lyman series lines , it is useful to examine marginally detected lines as well .",
    "for example , in several cases we detected the @xmath461031.93 line at the @xmath54 level , and the weaker corresponding @xmath461037.62 line was found at @xmath55 significance . in these cases , the marginally detected @xmath461037.62 line bolsters the identification , so we report the marginal @xmath56 @xmath52 measurement but mainly rely on the well - detected line for subsequent analyses .",
    "marginal ( and undetected ) lines such as higher lyman series lines are also useful for establishing that the well - detected line measurements are not badly affected by unresolved saturation .",

    "these discrepancies partly arise because in cases where the targets were observed with both stis and _ fuse _ , thom & chen use only the stis observations , while we use both the stis and the _ fuse _ data . in the redshift range where stis and _ fuse _ data overlap , the _ fuse _ spectra often have substantially better s / n ratios and hence reveal lines that are difficult to detect in the corresponding stis spectra .",

    "as noted above , the stis and _ fuse _ data have uncertainties in the wavelength - scale zero points as well as the relative wavelength calibration across the wavelength range of the observations .",
    "we bootstrap calibrated the _ fuse _ data by comparing similar lines in the _ fuse _ and stis spectra , and this procedure reduces the _ fuse _ zero - point uncertainty to @xmath74 km s@xmath13 . when comparing and components from stis data only , we adopt @xmath75 = 2 km s@xmath13 ( based on the relative wavelength accuracies from the stis handbook ) , and when comparing components measured from stis and _ fuse _ data , we use @xmath76 = 5 km s@xmath13 . if an and component pair have @xmath70(- ) @xmath77 , we consider the components to be aligned . in the majority of the absorbers ,",
    "the component matching is unambiguous : only one component is aligned with an component within the 2@xmath78 velocity difference uncertainty , or the and components are simply not aligned . however , in a very small number of cases , an component is aligned with two components to within the 2@xmath78 uncertainties . in these cases , we use the components with the smallest @xmath79(- ) for our analysis , but we discuss how such ambiguities could affect the results . in our analysis of aligned and components , we only use the measurements that are robust ; we exclude the components that are marked with a colon in table  [ compprop ] because those measurements suffer from large uncertainties for various reasons ( see appendix ) .    for convenience ,",
    "we number the components in each absorption system in column 8 of table  [ compprop ] , and we indicate whether the and components are aligned or offset from each other . if the components are aligned , we give the and components the same number , and if a component is offset , it is given a unique number .",

    "the o  vi and h  i profiles are quite similar . given the range of h  i / o  vi ratios found in o  vi systems , any o  vi associated with the weak component is likely to be undetectable at this signal - to - noise level .",

    "two examples of strong absorbers identified in our stis spectra are shown in figure  [ specsample ] .",
    "this figure shows small portions of the stis spectra of pks0312 - 770 and phl1811 covering systems at @xmath10 = 0.20266 and 0.19186 , respectively . the examples in figure  [ specsample ]",
    "demonstrate the tremendous diversity of low@xmath0 absorbers : from tables  [ intprop ] and [ compprop ] , we see that the column densities are similar in these pks0312 - 770 and phl1811 systems , but the @xmath24()/@xmath24 ( ) ratio is ostensibly @xmath85 times larger in the pks0312 - 770 example .",
    "this can partially be seen by comparing the paucity of ly@xmath57 absorption in the phl1811 case to the strongly saturated , multicomponent ly@xmath57 profile in the pks0312 - 770 system .",
    "there are several reasons that absorbers can show such a large range in the / ratio .",
    "first , when good constraints are available , it has been shown that the metallicities = log ( x / y ) - log ( x / y)@xmath86 , and we express linear metallicities with the variable @xmath87 . ] of apparently intergalactic , low@xmath0 qso absorbers span a large range from @xmath88 ( e.g. , tripp et al .",
    "2002 , 2005 ) up to @xmath89 ( e.g. , savage et al .",
    "2002 ; prochaska et al . 2004",
    "; jenkins et al . 2005 ; aracil et al .",
    "if the metallicity varies by a factor of 50 , the / ratio will vary by a similar ratio .",
    "second , the / ratio is very sensitive to the ionization conditions .",
    "as we will discuss in detail in  4 , in collisional ionization equilibrium , for example , relatively small changes in the gas temperature can lead to large changes in the / ratio .",
    "similarly , in photoionized gas , small changes in the gas density , ionizing flux , or ionizing radiation field shape can lead to substantial changes in the / ratio .",
    "third , many of the absorbers are _ multiphase _ absorbers .",
    "lower - ionization phases can substantially increase the absorption strength without increasing the strength at all .",
    "indeed , looking more closely at the examples in figure  [ specsample ] , we can find strong evidence that multiphase effects contribute to the huge difference in the / ratios in these particular cases .",
    "figure  [ speccontrast ] shows the continuum - normalized absorption profiles of selected , , , and transitions in the pks0312 - 770 and phl1811 absorbers .",
    "strong , multicomponent and absorption is clearly detected in the pks0312 - 770 system , but these low ions are not evident in the phl1811 absorber . moreover , the profiles of the and lines in the pks0312 - 770 case are quite similar to each other with at least three distinct components , two of which are relatively narrow .",
    "figure  [ pks0312multi ] shows a closer look at some of the pks0312 - 770 metal lines ( over a smaller velocity range ) . from this figure",
    ", we immediately see that the component structure differs from the low - ion component structure .",
    "the absorption extends over a similar velocity range but does not show the three distinct components seen in and .",
    "this indicates either that the lines originate in a different phase or that additional components are present in the profile that blend together and smear out the component structure ; either explanation requires at least some of the absorption to arise in separate phases from the low ions .",
    "the former explanation is more natural : if the absorption arises in hotter gas ( as expected since it peaks in abundance at @xmath15 k in collisionally ionized gas ) , its doppler parameter @xmath90 will be broader ( @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the temperature and @xmath93 is the atomic mass ) and the components would hence be more blended as seen in figure  [ pks0312multi ] .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that some high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) in the vicinity of the milky way have similar characteristics to the profiles shown in figure  [ pks0312multi ] , i.e. , and low - ion absorption spread over the same velocity range but with somewhat different centroids and/or line widths ( see , e.g. , sembach et al .",
    "2003 ; tripp et al . 2003 ; fox et al . 2004,2006 ; ganguly et al . 2005 ; collins et al . 2007 ) .",
    "it is not surprising to conclude that and low - ion lines originate in different phases ; this is expected intuitively because these species exist mainly in very different temperature ranges in collisionally ionized gas in equilibrium ( e.g. , bryans et al .",
    "2006 ) . ) or photoionized gas (  [ photoionsec ] ) under the right conditions . ]",
    "a more surprising result is that we also find that a substantial fraction of our absorbers show similar and profiles suggestive of single - phase clouds .",
    "we show four examples of intervening absorbers in figure  [ intsample1 ] . in these four examples ,",
    "we detect both and with good significance , and the and lines are well - aligned and have similar shapes . in these aligned systems ,",
    "the / ratio varies significantly from one system to the next ( and the ratio even varies among components within a single absorber as , e.g. , in the @xmath94 = 0.31658 system toward 3c 351.0 ) , but it is critical to notice how the and centroids are well - aligned in velocity , and the profile shapes are quite similar ( but are not identical ) .",
    "this suggests that the and originate in a single gas phase in these cases and provides an important constraint on the physical conditions of the gas ( as we will discuss further in  4 ) .    motivated by the mixture of evidence regarding the number of phases in the absorbers , we have classified the systems as either ( 1 ) `` simple '' absorbers that are entirely composed of aligned and componenents ( as defined in  [ aligndefsec ] ) , which suggests that the components could be single - phase absorbing entities , and ( 2 ) `` complex '' systems that show significant velocity offsets between low - ionization and high - ionization lines , which indicates that these absorbers are multiphase systems .",
    "these classifications are listed in column 2 of table  [ compprop ] . in a few absorbers ,",
    "the primary components are aligned in the and profiles , but weak components are detected in that do not show corresponding .",
    "an example of such a system is shown in figure  [ exsimstar ] . in this absorber in the spectrum of 3c 249.1",
    ", we see that the main component at @xmath95 km s@xmath13 is well - aligned in and , but an additional , rather weak component that shows no is evident at @xmath83 km s@xmath13 .",
    "the ly@xmath16 transition is very sensitive to low - density , low-@xmath24 ( ) gas , and when @xmath24 ( ) is very low , it is likely that any associated absorption is simply too weak to be detected at the s / n level of our data . in cases where",
    "the bulk of the and absorption is aligned but weak components are present with no corresponding ( as in figure  [ exsimstar ] ) , we classify the absorber as a simple case , but we mark the system with an asterisk in table  [ compprop ] to note the presence of weak without corresponding . in some instances , the profiles and component centroids are poorly constrained , e.g. , if the absorber is a black lyman - limit system presenting only badly saturated lyman series lines or if is not detected at all ( as found in several systems near the qso redshifts ) ; in these cases , we list the classification as uncertain . in the intervening absorber sample ,",
    "we classify 37% of the absorbers as simple ( single - phase ) systems and 53% as complex ( multiphase ) systems ( 10% have uncertain classifications ) .",
    "to show the quantitative distinction between the simple ( single - phase ) and complex ( multiphase ) intervening absorbers , we show in figure  [ veloffsets ] the velocity offsets between and components , @xmath70 ( - ) @xmath96 . for this figure",
    ", we match each component with the component that is closest in velocity . for this figure only ,",
    "all components are matched with an component , including cases where there are more components than components ( in these cases , multiple components are paired with the same line ) .",
    ", some of the proximate absorbers with @xmath3 are detected in the o  vi doublet without any affiliated h  i absorption .",
    "in contrast , in the intervening systems there are often clear velocity offsets between the o  vi and h  i absorption components , but we always find at least some significant h  i absorption within @xmath48100 km s@xmath13 of the o  vi . ]",
    "systems that have uncertain classification are excluded from figure  [ veloffsets ] , and components that are significantly uncertain due to problems such as blending and saturation ( components marked with a colon in table  [ compprop ] ) are also excluded . from this figure , we see that there is a clear kinematical distinction between simple / single - phase and complex / multiphase absorbers : some of our absorbers are characterized by highly - aligned and components , but an equally large fraction of the intervening systems have more complex relationships between and with significantly different kinematics .",
    "we will return to this distinction below .",
    "we classify the absorbers a second way for an orthogonal purpose : we list in column 2 of table  [ compprop ] whether the system is classified as an _ intervening _ absorber ( int ) or a _ proximate _ absorber ( prox ) .",
    "it has long been recognized that some of the so - called `` associated '' absorption systems ( often called `` proximate '' absorbers in the recent literature ) close to the redshift of the background qso ( @xmath3 ) have a fundamentally different nature from intervening absorbers that arise in the igm or ism of foreground objects ( e.g. , lynds 1967 ; burbidge 1970 ; foltz et al .",
    "the `` broad - absorption line '' ( bal ) qsos are easily recognized by their dramatic p cygni - like absorption troughs with outflow velocities approaching a substantial fraction of the speed of light ( see , e.g. , turnshek 1988 ) , but apart from bal qsos , there is a statistical excess of metal - bearing absorbers within @xmath97 5000 km s@xmath13 of @xmath11 ( foltz et al .",
    "1986 ) that in many regards look like the ordinary , narrow absorption lines that arise in foreground galaxies and the igm .",
    "however , evidence such as temporal variability ( on timescales of a few years ) and/or incomplete covering of the background flux source indicates that at least some `` narrow '' absorption lines originate in material located quite close to the qso itself ( see , e.g. , hamann 1997 ; yuan et al .",

    "2003 , and references therein ) .    following the seminal work of weymann et al .",

    "( 1986 ) , narrow absorption lines found within 5000 km s@xmath13 of the qso redshift are usually classified as associated ( proximate ) absorbers , and we adhere to this standard definition in this paper ( however , in some cases we show how the measurements change if we change the velocity cutoff for the proximate absorber classification ) . the velocity of displacement @xmath98 must account for relativistic effects but can be easily determined from the qso and absorber redshifts using the usual @xmath57 formula , @xmath99 we also distinguish between associated absorbers and `` mini - bal '' systems .",
    "mini - bals show many of the characteristics of bals but are spread over a smaller velocity range ( e.g. , barlow et al .",
    "one of our sight lines ( 3c 351.0 ) shows a clear example of a mini - bal with strong evidence that the absorption lines arise in intrinsic material close to the qso .",
    "this is clearly a different type of absorption system , and we do not include it in our samples . a full analysis of the 3c 351.0 mini - bal has been presented by yuan et al .",
    ".    however , the 5000 km s@xmath13 velocity interval used to define proximate absorbers corresponds to a relatively large hubble - flow distance , and it is inevitable that some truly intervening absorbers will be classified as associated just because they are located in the 5000 km s@xmath13 region of space near the qso ; indeed , sembach et al .",
    "( 2004 ) show examples of this problem ( see their  10 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "compelling direct evidence of narrow absorption systems associated with the qso with @xmath100 5000 km s@xmath13 has been found at high redshifts ; hamann , barlow , & junkkarinen ( 1997 ) reported clear temporal variability and partial coverage of the flux source in an absorber displaced by @xmath9724,000 km s@xmath13 from the emission redshift of q2343 + 125 ( @xmath11 = 2.24 ) , for example .",

    "more recently , misawa et al . ( 2007 ) have searched for partial coverage in narrow metal - line absorbers detected in high - resolution keck spectra of 37 high@xmath0 qsos , and they conclude that @xmath103% of narrow absorbers are intrinsic ( associated with the qso ) in the 5000 @xmath102 75,000 km s@xmath13 interval .    evidently , displacement velocity might not provide a straightforward means of distinguishing between intervening and _ intrinsic _ absorbers .",
    "the absorbers that are usually referred to as associated systems are a mixture of intervening and intrinsic absorbers . to avoid the confusing connotations of the term `` associated '' , in this paper we will follow recent papers ( e.g. , ellison et al .",
    "2002 ; russell et al . 2006 ; hennawi & prochaska 2007 ) and refer to any absorber with @xmath104 5000 km s@xmath13 as a `` proximate '' absorber regardless of its nature / origin , but we use `` intrinsic '' to connote that the system is physically close to the qso .",
    "it is important to bear in mind the possible confusion that intrinsic systems could cause in samples of intervening systems defined based on @xmath98 .",
    "because nearby galaxy redshifts are more straightforwardly measured , an advantage of low@xmath0 samples is that if @xmath105% of the systems in the @xmath106 km s@xmath13 interval are intrinsic / ejected , we should find that this fraction of the metal systems are randomly distributed with respect to the foreground galaxies .",

    ", we simply tabulate the number of systems detected with @xmath109 and divide by the total path @xmath110 over which we were able to search for the absorbers . however , there are a few minor complications in this simple calculation . first , the s / n ratios of our spectra are not completely uniform ; some sight lines have higher over s / n ratios than others , and even along a single sight line , some wavelength regions have higher s / n .",
    "second , some redshifts are blocked by strong galactic ism lines or unrelated extragalactic lines .",
    "these blocked regions reduce the total @xmath110 that is effectively searched for absorption systems .",
    "the total @xmath110 and number of absorbers in a given sample must carefully account for the variable s / n and blocking of the spectra .",
    "for example , suppose that a line with @xmath111 150 m  is detected in a spectral region with s / n that is only sufficient to detect lines with @xmath112 100 m .",
    "that region would not be included in the total @xmath110 for a sample with @xmath112 30 m , and thus the 150 mline can not be counted in a @xmath112 30 m  sample .",
    "however , this absorber would be included in a sample with @xmath113 100 mor larger .    to account for the variable s / n of the data and blocking by unrelated lines , we calculate for each sight line the rest - frame",
    "@xmath53 limiting equivalent width at each observed wavelength @xmath46 where absorbers can be detected , @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the total uncertainty in an equivalent width integrated over some number of pixels . for a single pixel @xmath116 ,",

    "therefore , to evaluate @xmath123 , we must integrate over @xmath124 pixels , @xmath125 for a given limiting equivalent width , we have empirically determined the number of pixels to integrate over based on the _ detected _ lines with measured equivalent widths close to the limiting equivalent width of interest ( see further details below ) .",
    "after @xmath126 has been evaluated over the full range of coverage for all 16 sight lines , we evaluate @xmath110 for various samples of lines with strengths greater than @xmath52 by summing the total redshift path over which @xmath127 .",

    "the top panel of figure  [ pathcalc ] shows the 3c 249.1 stis spectrum ( binned to @xmath97 35 km s@xmath13 pixels to more clearly show the characteristics of the spectrum ) , and the lower panel shows the @xmath53 limiting equivalent width obtained by integrating over 15-pixel detection windows ( 15 full - resolution , unbinned pixels ) .",
    "figure  [ pathcalc ] shows several important characteristics of the data that deserve comment .",
    "first , the proper calculation of @xmath123 automatically corrects for portions of the spectra that are blocked by strong interstellar or extragalactic lines . in these regions ,",
    "the s / n drops precipitously and @xmath126 increases accordingly ; if neither the @xmath129 line nor the @xmath56 line falls in a region with sufficient sensitivity , then that redshift window does not contribute to the total @xmath110 .",
    "in addition , when moderate strength lines are present , @xmath123 increases , but these locations _ can _ add to @xmath130 for samples of stronger lines .",
    "for example , a contaminating 150 m  ism line might effectively hide a 30 m  extragalactic line , but it would not hide a 300 m   line , and this is properly evaluated using this approach .",
    "second , the s / n and @xmath126 are not uniform across a stis e140 m spectrum for several reasons .",
    "the stis e140 m sensitivity peaks at @xmath1311340   and decreases at shorter and longer wavelengths .",
    "however , superimposed on this broad and slowly - varying sensitivity is a sawtooth pattern due to the blaze function of the echelle grating : within _ each _ echelle order , the s / n decreases significantly when moving away from the blaze peak .",
    "this is partly mitigated in regions where adjacent orders overlap ; in these overlapping regions , coaddition of the two orders recovers some of the lost signal - to - noise .",
    "given these various effects , it is clear that the limiting equivalent width is a complicated array that is not easily approximated by a simple function .",
    "however , our method fully accomodates the various sources of sensitivity variations .",
    "as can be seen from figures  [ specsample]-[ascsample2 ] and tables  [ intprop]-[compprop ] , many of the systems show multiple ( often blended ) components spread over 200@xmath31500 km s@xmath13 intervals .",
    "the way that the _ individual _ components within these blends are counted introduces another source of uncertainty in @xmath5 measurements .",
    "for example , the absorber at @xmath10 = 0.31658 toward 3c 351.0 shows three blended ( but clearly detected and distinct ) components at @xmath132 = @xmath133 and 70 km s@xmath13 ( see figure  [ intsample1 ] ) . does this",
    "case count as one or three absorption systems ?",
    "these velocity differences correspond to a substantial distance in a pure hubble flow , and it is conceivable that the three components in this example arise in gas associated with three discrete galaxies .",
    "but , the three components could alternatively be due to three clouds within the surroundings of a single galaxy .",
    "published theoretical @xmath5 predictions often do not specify how the absorbers how counted , and indeed , the appropriate method likely depends on the purpose of the @xmath5 measurement .",
    "this issue has greatest impact on our @xmath5 measurements for absorbers with the largest equivalent widths ; these cases are rare and almost always show evidence multiple components , so spliting the high-@xmath52 cases into several lower-@xmath52 cases reduces @xmath5 for the highest @xmath52 bins . to show how this issue affects our results , we report two separate @xmath5 measurements .",
    "we estimate @xmath5 for _ systems _ , in which we count multiple components that are contiguously connected with each other as a _ single _ case , and we also determine @xmath5 for _ components _ where every identified individual component is counted as a separate case .      )",
    "over which the 16 qso sight lines have sufficient signal - to - noise ratio to detect intervening o  vi lines with rest - frame equivalent width @xmath112 limiting @xmath52 , calculated as described in  [ dndzsec ] .",

    "table  [ asscdndztab ] lists the same quantities but for the _ proximate _ absorbers . as discussed above ,",
    "typically associated / proximate absorbers are defined in the literature to be any system with @xmath134 km s@xmath13 , so we derive @xmath5 assuming this standard definition , and the results are shown in the upper half of table  [ asscdndztab ] .",

    ". however , our @xmath5 measurements are systematically higher than those of danforth & shull ( 2005 ) by roughly @xmath139 dex .",
    "we can identify several reasons why we find systematically higher @xmath5 values than danforth & shull ( 2005 ) for intervening systems including the following : ( 1 ) danforth & shull ( 2005 ) only searched for affiliated with absorption systems that have ly@xmath16 lines with equivalent widths greater than 80 m . in our sample , on the other hand , we include all absorbers regardless of the strength of the corresponding ly@xmath16 line . from table",
    "[ intprop ] , we see that we do find absorbers with weak corresponding ly@xmath16 lines with @xmath52(ly@xmath16 ) @xmath14080 m .",
    "our inclusion of these weak - ly@xmath16 absorbers increases @xmath5 compared to the results of danforth & shull ( 2005 ) .",
    "( 2 ) we do not classify any absorbers within 5000 km s@xmath13 of the qso redshift as an intervening absorber , while danforth et al . (",
    "2006 ) use 1800 km s@xmath13 as the cutoff for intervening vs. proximate absorbers .",
    "the danforth & shull proximate absorber definition results in a larger @xmath110 searched for intervening per sight line , and since we do not find many lines in the @xmath141 km s@xmath13 interval ( see below ) , this has the net effect of increasing @xmath110 palpably without increasing the total number of systems much . using the 1800 km s@xmath13 cutoff therefore decreases @xmath5 .",
    "if we were to adopt the danforth & shull proximate absorber cutoff , our @xmath5 measurements would decrease by 0.03 dex .",
    "( 3 ) danforth & shull integrate over a _ single _ resolution element in order to determine their limiting equivalent width .",
    "since very few ( if any ) of our detected systems are completely unresolved and spread over a single resolution element , we choose to integrate over a larger number of pixels to determine @xmath108 as discussed above .",
    "this results in higher @xmath108 in our sample and a _ lower _ total @xmath110 over which our data have sufficient s / n to reveal an system of a given strength . if we were to also integrate over a single resolution element , our @xmath110 values would increase and our @xmath5 numbers would decrease .",
    "this issue is most important for the samples that include the weakest lines ( e.g. , the @xmath112 30 m  sample ) .",
    "individually , these three factors have small effects on the measured @xmath5 , but they all change @xmath5 in the same direction when comparing our results to those of danforth & shull ( 2005 )",

    "nevertheless , the simplest model is to assume that if the and line centroids are well - aligned and the profiles have similar shapes , then the and absorption lines arise in the same ( single - phase ) gas cloud .",

    "we plot the best temperatures and upper limits derived from @xmath90 ( ) and @xmath90 ( ) ( columns 6 and 7 from table  [ alignedtab ] ) as a function of @xmath90 ( ) in figure  [ temperatureplot ] , and we show the differential distributions of these estimations of @xmath208 and @xmath197 in figures  [ tempdist ] and [ bntdist ] , respectively . from these figures",
    ", we see that the quantitative results derived in this section corroborate the qualitative conclusion reached from comparison of the and profiles in  [ shapesection ] : _ a large fraction of the well - matched components appear to be too cold to arise in whim gas _ ( with the standard @xmath17 k whim definition ) .",

    "evidently , many of the well - matched components are not consistent with collisional ionization at the standard temperatures where is found in cie , and most of these aligned components are not consistent with the standard temperatures expected for whim gas .",
    "it is possible that most of the whim gas is located in the multiphase absorbers ( as we discuss below ) , but in the simple absorbers we find strong evidence that a substantial fraction of these systems are either photoionized or arise in collisionally ionized gas that is out of equilibrium .",
    "it is interesting to examine the temperatures in figures  [ temperatureplot ] and [ tempdist ] more closely .",
    "while most of aligned components imply temperatures lower than log @xmath92 = 5.5 , ten of the aligned components ( 26% ) in table  [ alignedtab ] imply log @xmath210 4.6 , which is warmer than the temperatures expected in standard photoionization models ( see , e.g. , the photoionization models reported in sembach et al . 2004 and lehner et al . 2006 ) .",
    "these moderately warm systems could arise in shock - heated gas that has cooled more rapidly than it can recombine and thus is in an overionized , moderately warm condition .",
    "it is also interesting to note that aligned components that are found within multiphase systems ( indicated with hatching in figures  [ tempdist ] and [ bntdist ] ) tend to indicate higher temperatures and greater amounts of nonthermal broadening .",

    "[ tempdist ] , all of the aligned components from intervening systems are shown with an open histogram .",

    "there are 70 components in the robust intervening sample . from table",
    "[ alignedtab ] , we see that there are 24 components with log @xmath211 in the simplest model .",
    "this indicates that at least 34% of the intervening components are cooler than the standard @xmath189 k whim cutoff .",
    "conversely , at least 14% of the robust sample of intervening components has log @xmath212 ( hotter than expected in typical photoionization models ) .      we have presented strong evidence that many of the low@xmath0 lines arise in cool gas",
    "for many of the components , the temperature constraints in table  [ alignedtab ] preclude a whim origin at the collisional ionization equilibrium temperatures where is expected to peak in abundance ( e.g. , sutherland & dopita 1993 ) .",
    "but could the absorption lines arise in collisionally ionized gas that is out of equilibrium ?    in the context of the milky way ism , the possibility that high ions could be detectable in non - equilibrium , overionized gas has long been considered ( e.g. , kafatos 1973 ; shapiro & moore 1976 ; edgar & chevalier 1986 ; indebetouw & shull 2004 ; gnat & sternberg 2007 ) . if shock - heated , highly ionized gas can cool more rapidly than it recombines , then species like might be found in surprisingly cool material .",

    "however , there are several factors that could make @xmath215 shorter : first , in low@xmath0 igm clouds where several metals are detected , studies have indicated metallicities significantly greater than 0.1 @xmath220 ( e.g. , savage et al .",

    "similar studies of low@xmath0 systems with well - constrained metallicities have indicated @xmath219 ( e.g. , tripp et al . 2002,2005 ) .",
    "there appears to be a very large range in the metallicity of the low@xmath31 igm , and it is not clear what metallicity should be assumed for a random igm cloud , but it has been shown that some clouds are significantly enriched and therefore could cool more quickly .",
    "second , if the whim is heated by lower - velocity shocks , the initial temperature might be lower than usually assumed , which increases @xmath214 .",
    "if the initial temperature is only @xmath221 k , for example , the gas will cool more rapidly ( see figure 4 in gnat & sternberg ) .",
    "thirdly , the gas densities could be somewhat higher than @xmath222 @xmath218 .",
    "for the well - aligned sample , log @xmath24 ( ) ranges from @xmath97 13.3 to 14.5 ( see figure  [ plainh1o6 ] ) . the number density @xmath124 ( ) = @xmath223()/@xmath224 , where @xmath224 is the size of the cloud in mpc .",
    "at log @xmath92 = 5.5 , the ion fraction is @xmath225 ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ; gnat & sternberg 2007 ) , so if @xmath224 = 100 kpc and @xmath226 k , the total h density in the well - aligned absorbers ranges from @xmath227 @xmath218 to @xmath228 @xmath218 .",

    "we can see that the two fits are nearly indistinguishable , and the fits have nearly identical goodness of fit ( @xmath284 = 1.030 vs. @xmath283 = 1.031 ) . between the two fits , the main two components ( i.e. , the two components evident in the higher lyman series ) change by tiny amounts ; the changes occur in the weaker components required to fit the structure in the wings of the ly@xmath16 and @xmath57 profiles .",
    "however , these changes in the weak outlying components have major implications for the gas conditions .",

    "would then imply an oxygen abundance of [ o / h ] = @xmath290 .",
    "these examples show that broad components could be present in the complex profiles , and in some cases , the combination of broad and is consistent with whim temperatures and relatively low metallicities .",
    "these results are intriguing , but we must recognize that this only shows that hot gas is _ allowed _ by the data ; these analyses do not uniquely require the presence of whim material . without additional information",

    "as noted , high s / n and spectral resolution would be helpful for constraining the physical conditions in these absorbers . also , ancillary species such as can be immensely valuable for identification of hot gas ( e.g. , savage et al . 2005 ) .",
    "x - ray absorption lines would also be useful , but the spectral resolution available in the x - ray bandpass is still quite limited .      figure  [ h1821complex ] demonstrates another notable characteristic of multiphase absorbers .",
    "we have remarked above that multiphase systems have larger velocity offsets between the and centroids ( see figure  [ veloffsets ] ) .",
    "the @xmath10 = 0.22638 absorber in figure  [ h1821complex ] shows an example of one of the largest velocity offsets between and in an intervening absorber : in this system , the is detected @xmath95 km s@xmath13 while and weak are found at @xmath291 km s@xmath13 .",
    "some absorption is present in the velocity range where is detected , but this could be just the wing of the line at @xmath292 km s@xmath13 . why does this well - detected absorber have so little affiliated ?",
    "one possibility is that this absorber is similar to the proximate absorbers and has a very high metallicity so that the affiliated column is too low to be detected .",
    "however , another possibility is that this particular doublet arises in collisionally ionized hot plasma with a temperature that makes the difficult to detect .",
    "the measured @xmath58value is @xmath293 km s@xmath13 , which is consistent with gas at @xmath15 .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ hiddenbla ] shows theoretical ly@xmath16 profiles that would be expected to be affiliated with this absorber in collisionally ionized gas at log @xmath92 = 5.30 , 5.48 , and 5.60 with @xmath238 .",
    "these predicted profiles use the gnat & sternberg ( 2007 ) cie ion fractions to predict the column density ( based on the measured @xmath24 ( ) and assumed metallicity ) , and the line widths are for the purely thermally broadened case ( nonthermal broadening can only make the lines broader ) .",
    "we see that with log @xmath92 = 5.30 , a strong ( and easily detected ) line is expected ( red line in figure  [ hiddenbla ] ) .",
    "the line is strong because even though the ion fraction is low at this @xmath92 , the ion fraction drops very rapidly at log @xmath294 ( see figure  [ gnatfracs ] ) , and consequently , @xmath24 ( ) has to be high in order to produce the observed @xmath24 ( ) . of course ,",
    "@xmath24 ( ) can be increased by increasing @xmath87 and/or @xmath24 ( ) ; an alternative solution is that @xmath295 .",
    "however , we see from figure  [ hiddenbla ] that if log @xmath92 = 5.48 or 5.60 , close to the temperature of peak abundance in cie , then the affiliated @xmath24 ( ) is low enough so that the expected ly@xmath16 profile ( yellow or green lines in figure  [ hiddenbla ] ) would be difficult or impossible to detect at the current s / n levels",
    ". thus , this system could be in the warm - hot range with a realistic metallicity , and the expected broad would be hidden in the noise .",
    "this raises a question : could similar `` hidden '' broad components be present in the aligned components discussed in  [ tempsec ] ?",
    "the middle panel of figure  [ hiddenbla ] explores this possibility .",
    "this panel shows the well - aligned and absorption lines at @xmath10 = 0.24531 in the spectrum of h1821 + 643 with theoretical ly@xmath16 profiles , calculated as described in the previous paragraph , for log @xmath92 = 5.30 , 5.48 , 5.60 , 5.70 , 5.78 , and 5.84 .",
    "we see that none of these model ly@xmath16 profiles fit the observed ly@xmath16 line very well .",
    "however , if this is a multiphase absorber with a narrow core from a lower - ionization phase that does not contribute to the absorption , then a broad component would be allowed by the data as long as the temperature is in a narrow range ( or @xmath296 ) .",

    "likewise , models with log @xmath298 5.6 are ruled out ; these models lead to ly@xmath16 profiles that are too strong and too broad .",
    "we conclude that this aligned @xmath31 absorber could harbor a hidden broad ly@xmath16 component arising in the hot phase , but only if the absorber is multiphase and the temperature is fine - tuned to a relatively narrow range near the peak temperature and/or the metallicity is relatively high .",
    "we noted in  [ tempsec ] that some of the aligned absorbers are outside of the physically allowed range of @xmath90 ( ) and @xmath90 ( ) . occasionally , these unphysical cases could be due to coincidental alignment with unrelated absorption lines .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ hiddenbla ] shows an example of coincidental alignment with unrelated absorption in the absorber at @xmath10 = 0.15786 toward phl1811 . in this case",
    ", an apparently very narrow line seems to be aligned with the strongest component of a multicomponent profile , and the candidate line is too narrow ( compared to ) to be in the physically allowed regime .",
    "this unphysical combination is due to coincidental alignment of the with an unrelated line : the narrow component in this case is actually not but rather is the @xmath461302.17 line from the lyman limit absorber at @xmath10 = 0.08092 ( see jenkins et al .",
    "however , close inpection of the profile reveals weak absorption in the wings of the narrow feature . those weak absorption wings do not appear to be due to because that component structure is not corroborated by stronger metal - line profiles of other low ions at the redshift .",
    "the weak components could be due to ly@xmath16 absorption at the redshift .",
    "interestingly , if the two components at @xmath10 = 0.15786 have log @xmath92 = 5.48 and @xmath299 , then the two expected broad ly@xmath16 components associated with the would explain the weak components in the wings of the profile ( see the yellow line in figure  [ hiddenbla ] ) .    hidden broad ly@xmath16 lines are allowed for most of the intervening absorbers .",
    "as shown in columns 4 and 5 of table  [ alignedtab ] , the line widths usually allow temperatures near the peak ( log @xmath300 5.5 ) , and given the typical @xmath24 ( ) , at this temperature an affiliated broad ly@xmath16 component would usually be hidden in the noise .",
    "this explanation requires that essentially all of the intervening absorbers are multiphase because another ( -free ) phase is required to explain the rest of the ly@xmath16 absorption . for many of the absorbers ,",
    "the temperature or metallicity must be tuned to avoid producing overly strong broad ly@xmath16 . however ,",
    "some of the strong multiphase systems have broad features that could be due to at somewhat lower temperatures ( e.g. , tripp et al .",
    "this scenario is similar to the favored models for the hvcs seen in the vicinity of the milky way ( sembach et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the correlation of log [ @xmath24()/@xmath24 ( ) ] with log @xmath24 ( ) could be an indication that the absorption arises in some type of interface layer on the surface of a lower - ionization cloud . in this argument ,",
    "the column density is determined by the interface physics and is independent of the column density of the interior cloud .",
    "this scenario is not required by the data : we have shown in figure  [ photoschaye ] and  [ photoionsec ] that photoionization models can explain the correlation if the igm metallicity and uv background shape and intensity are variable .",
    "however , we have also shown in the previous section that the current data can not rule out hidden broad ly@xmath16 lines that would indicate that the arises in a hot phase that is closely aligned in velocity with a cooler lower - ionization phase that produces the bulk of the detected absorption .    to evaluate this hypothesis , it is useful to consider _ fuse _ observations of absorption detected in the very local interstellar medium ( lism ) within a few hundred parsecs of the sun ( oegerle et al .",
    "2005 ; savage & lehner 2006 ) . in these samples ,",
    "the short pathlength to the background star ( @xmath301 230 pc ) precludes production of by photoionization .",
    "in addition , the sun is surrounded by a bubble of hot , x - ray emitting gas with @xmath302 k ( e.g. , smith et al .",
    "2007 ) , so this context provides observational information on the properties of absorption arising in interface layers .",
    "interestingly , savage & lehner ( 2006 ) find that find @xmath9740% of the absorption line velocity centroids in the lism are aligned with absorption centroids to within @xmath48 10 km s@xmath13 ( see their figure 11 ) .",
    "this supports the hypothesis that could originate in an interface without having different kinematics ( velocity centroids ) compared to the low - ionization phase .",
    "however , savage & lehner also find that more than half of their local lines show clear and significant velocity offsets .",
    "overall , the velocity offsets of the lism absorbers appear to be similar to those observed in the extragalactic systems of this paper .",
    "however , there is a significant difference between lism absorbers and the extragalactic systems : the lism column densities are substantially lower .",
    "savage & lehner find 12.38 @xmath303log @xmath24 ( ) @xmath304 13.60 in the lism with a median of log @xmath24 ( ) = 13.10 .",

    "1990 ) , but the extragalactic @xmath24 ( ) measurements are up to @xmath9750 times higher . therefore , _ many interfaces are required _ to explain the qso systems according to these interface models and lism observations .",
    "this problem is exacerbated by the fact that the extragalactic absorbers are likely to have significantly lower metallicities than the lism systems ; lower metallicity will further reduce the @xmath24 ( ) expected in an interface . with the requirement of many interfaces to produce the observed @xmath24 ( )",
    ", we would expect to find complexity in the absorption profiles ( due to variations of the / ratios and vs. kinematics from one cloud to the next within the multilayer system ) .",
    "some of the qso profiles show considerable complexity , but others appear to be relatively simple . given this problem ,",
    "it is not clear if interface models can fit the properties of the simple extragalactic systems .",
    "however , we note that other models of interstellar production ( see table 1 in indebetouw & shull 2004 ) , such as radiatively cooling clouds or bubbles blown by supernovae / stellar winds , do predict columns that are substantially higher",
    ". we also note that in a survey of 148 milky way stars , bowen et al .",
    "( 2007 ) find that the scatter in @xmath24 ( ) does not decrease with increasing sight line pathlength , which indicates that the absorption lines do not arise in clouds with a fixed size and density .",
    "these factors suggest that collisionally ionized hot can originate in a variety of contexts with significant variations in cloud characteristics .",
    "the milky way hvcs ( sembach et al . 2003 ; wakker et al . 2003 ) suffer a similar problem to the extragalactic systems : the in galactic hvcs is thought to arise in interfaces ( e.g. , sembach et al .",

    "what do these analyses imply about the baryonic content of the low@xmath0 igm and the missing baryons ?",
    "several previous papers have shown that low - redshift absorbers harbor roughly 5% of the baryons in the nearby universe ( tripp et al .",
    "2000,2006b ; savage et al .",
    "2002 ; sembach et al .",
    "2004 ; danforth & shull 2005 ; lehner et al .",
    "most of these papers have assumed that the mean metallicity of the systems is @xmath305 and that the ion fraction ( @xmath306 /o@xmath307 ) is less than @xmath27 .",
    "the latter assumption is secure ( see , e.g. , the appendix in tripp & savage 2000 ) , but as noted by lehner et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and as discussed above , many recent studies have found @xmath308 in nearby igm absorbers .",

    "the uncertain metallicity of the absorbers is currently a large source of uncertainty in @xmath309 ( ) .",
    "new measurements of @xmath309 ( ) should employ detailed metallicity constraints for each absorber in the sample instead of assuming a mean @xmath311 , or at least the assumed value for @xmath311 should be based on a sample of measured metallicities .",
    "unfortunately , many of the systems are only detected in and . with only these two species ,",
    "the metallicity of the systems remains uncertain .",
    "better constraints on @xmath309 ( ) will require secure measurements of other metals in the absorbers .",
    "however , another problem with @xmath309 ( ) estimates is that most previous studies have included _ all _ intervening absorption systems in the @xmath309 ( ) measurement regardless of the physical conditions of the absorbers .",
    "the contribution to the baryon budget from low@xmath0 photoionized gas has been separately estimated from studies of ly@xmath16 lines ( e.g. , penton et al .",
    "2004 ; lehner et al . 2007 ) and is often included in baryon inventories ( e.g. , fukugita et al .",
    "1998 ) , so by including photoionized and collisionally ionized systems together in a single estimate of @xmath309 ( ) , some double - counting of baryons could occur . to avoid this double counting , @xmath312 ( ) should be split into @xmath313 ( ) and @xmath314 ( ) , the baryonic content of whim and photoionized systems .",
    "our physical conditions analysis indicates that at least 34% of the intervening components present compelling evidence of cool temperatures ( log @xmath241 5.0 ) .",
    "however , we also found in  [ tempsec ] that at least 14% of the components have log @xmath315 , which is hotter than the temperatures typically expected in photoionized intergalactic gas .",
    "the intermediate - temperature cases with log @xmath316 4.6 could arise in plasma that was initially shock - heated and is now rapidly radiatively cooling .",

    "kang et al .",
    "( 2005 ) report that in their hydrodynamic models of cosmological structure growth , many sheet - like structures are shock - heated and contain material that conceptually should be classified as `` whim '' plasma , but in their models , the shock velocities are lower , and they conclude that an important fraction of the baryons are in the shocked igm but with @xmath317 k , which they refer to as the `` low - temperature '' whim .",
    "kang et al .",
    "( 2005 ) analyze the physical conditions and ionization of the low - temperature whim , and they find that this igm phase is predominantly photoionized .",

    ". the models of kang et al .",
    "( 2005 ) are consistent with the observational constraints that we have derived in this paper .",
    "we have also noted that the absorbers that provide the strongest evidence of @xmath17 k plasma tend to be complex , multiphase absorbers with multiple components ( some of which do not have associated ) and ( in some cases ) clear absorption by low ionization stages . in these multicomponent , multiphase systems , it is easy to hide a broad component that would be associated with hot .",
    "we classify 53% of the intervening systems as complex / multiphase absorbers , and these complex systems could be the primary harbor of the @xmath17 k plasma .",
    "in fact , some of the simulations show that @xmath17 k plasma is often surrounded by cooler gas , and these simulations predict these `` embedded '' whim locations produce peaks in density maps ( see , e.g. , figures 4 - 6 in cen & ostriker 2006 ) .",
    "it seems likely that random sight lines through the cosmological simulations would often find that the whim is located in regions where cooler gas phases are also present , and consequently from these regions will be affiliated with complex , multicomponent and lower - ion profiles at similar velocities , like some of the observed multiphase systems .",
    "theoretical predictions regarding the characteristics of and profiles in various environments would be helpful for checking the consistency of the models and the observations .",
    "it should also be borne in mind that the detectability of depends on the metallicity of the gas .",
    "if the missing baryons are predominantly located in gas that is shock - heated when it first accretes into galaxy potentials , then the whim plasma could have a relatively low metallicity , and could be difficult to detect in the whim phase in currently available data . instead of , broad ly@xmath16 lines ( blas ) can be used to search for the low@xmath0 whim , and several studies have reported detections of bla candidates at low redshifts ( tripp et al .",

    "only a small fraction of the reported blas are also detected in ( the doublet is covered but not detected in most cases ) .",
    "we can show that the lack of affiliated absorption is consistent with a whim origin for the blas .",
    "the approximate carbon metallicity of the high - redshift igm is [ c / h ] @xmath319 ( schaye et al . 2003 ) .",
    "if the low - redshift whim has a similar metallicity , then using the and ion fractions from gnat & sternberg ( 2007 ) , we find that @xmath24()/@xmath24 ( ) @xmath320 .",
    "since most low@xmath0 blas have @xmath24 ( ) @xmath321 @xmath68 ( lehner et al . 2007 ) , in collisionally ionized plasma we predict that the corresponding @xmath24 ( ) @xmath322 @xmath68 , which is comparable to the lowest columns that we are currently able to reliably detect . since the whim metallicity could be substantially lower than @xmath323 , and because @xmath24()/@xmath24 ( ) @xmath320 is derived at the peak of the / vs. temperature curve , the / ratios could be substantially lower in blas .",

    "initially , this offset appeared to be due to a hot pixel feature falling in the middle of the @xmath461031.93 line , but this can not be the cause because the pks0405 - 123 observations were obtained on two separate occasions ( see table  [ obslog ] ) , and the spectrum detector position was shifted between the two visits . the same component structure is evident in the profiles extracted separately from the two visits , so this problem is not due to a hot - pixel feature .",
    "apart from this small offset , the @xmath67 profiles of the lines at @xmath373 km s@xmath13 appear to be quite consistent : the relative strength and shape of the two lines are in agreement .",
    "this suggests that the offset could be caused by an instrumental calibration problem .",
    "for example , the stis geometric distortion can cause offsets of this magnitude if not properly corrected ( walsh et al . 2001 ; maz - apellniz & beda 2004 ) , and some problems with the distortion correction have been noted ( maz - apellniz & beda 2004 ) .",
    "evidence of wavelength calibration problems have also been noted when comparing lines that should have identical component structure ( e.g. , jenkins & tripp 2001 ; tripp et al .",
    "2005 ) . while we have found these problems to be relatively rare , the stability of the stis gemometric distortion correction has not been studied systematically , and it remains possible that the discrepancy in the @xmath373 km s@xmath13 component is caused by a calibration problem such as this .",
    "nevertheless , we flag the lines in the @xmath373 km s@xmath13 component with a colon in table  [ compprop ] because of this disagreement , and we treat this component as an insecure identification . with the new cosmic origins spectrograph , it will be possible to reobserve pks0405 - 123 to determine if the offset is due to a stis instrumental problem .",
    "the @xmath461037.62 line at this redshift falls close to galactic @xmath461550.78 ( which is the source of the extra absorption evident at @xmath375 km s@xmath13 in figure  [ pks0405fig ] ) , but from the corresponding galactic @xmath461548.20 line , we can see that the milky way has little impact on the redshifted @xmath461037.62 profile .",
    "we give this system an uncertain classification due to the insecure identification of the component at @xmath373 km s@xmath13 and the fact that the ly@xmath16 profile , which is needed to detect low-@xmath24 ( ) components , has not been observed at high resolution .",
