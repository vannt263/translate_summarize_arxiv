    "although finite - temperature field theory provides the natural framework to describe thermodynamic properties and phase transitions in plasmas involving gauge fields , its perturbative realization faces dreadful obstacles produced by severe infrared divergences in the gauge sector @xcite .    in the case of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at finite temperature @xmath5 , where the theory is defined in @xmath11 and the compact direction in @xmath12 lies along the euclidean time with period @xmath4 , one can say that the domain of validity of the _ naive _ , plain perturbation expansion is tremendously restricted @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    along the years , this difficulty stimulated the development of techniques that reorganize the perturbative series , improving significantly the weak - coupling expansion ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular",
    ", one can build an effective theory by using the separation of scales provided by @xmath5 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , which is known as dimensionally reduced effective theory , or electrostatic qcd ( eqcd ) @xcite .",
    "the pressure , for instance , is currently known up to @xmath15 at high temperatures and at most moderate chemical potentials @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can resort to the hard thermal loop ( htl ) framework @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for recent results ) .",
    "nevertheless , at order @xmath17 in the gauge coupling of a non - abelian gauge theory at finite temperature , it is well known that perturbation theory breaks down due to infrared divergences in the magnetic sector , the notorious linde problem @xcite .",
    "therefore , to implement eqcd one is then obliged to match the coefficients of the order @xmath17 to computations in lattice qcd in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "the compactification brought about by the finite temperature framework is the key ingredient responsible for the linde problem since the static large distance behavior of the gauge theory at high @xmath5 is the same as in 3-dimensional gauge theory , which confines at the scale @xmath18 . on the other hand , at zero temperature and finite density the fermi sea does not produce dimensional reduction and this infrared problem is absent @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to investigate how the linde problem may be affected when thermal yang - mills theory is subjected to an additional compactification along a spatial direction 4-dimensional thermal gauge theories defined in compact spaces , such as @xmath19 , have been studied in @xcite . ] .    in this note",
    "we investigate the case of a pure glue @xmath0 plasma on a torus given by @xmath20 , with @xmath7 being the length of the compactified spatial direction . by construction , this system is symmetric under the mapping @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which we denominate _ radius exchange symmetry_. a double trace deformation @xcite of this theory in the limit of large number of colors was used in @xcite to understand the interplay between the color electric and magnetic sectors in the deconfinement phase transition @xcite . here",
    "we show that in this theory linde s problem is much more severe and any perturbative calculation breaks down already at order @xmath9 due to the presence of a non - perturbative scale @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , observables in this theory ( such as the pressure or screening masses ) can only be computed non - perturbatively even when the gauge coupling is arbitrarily small .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ oldlinde ]",
    "we summarize the main aspects behind linde s original argument . in section [ newlinde ]",
    "we discuss the relevant properties of the perturbative yang - mills plasma on @xmath20 and the different regimes of the theory including the full breakdown of perturbation theory in this context . in section [ conclusion ]",
    "we present our final remarks and outlook .",
    "in his seminal 1980 paper @xcite , linde argued that the perturbative study of yang - mills theory defined in @xmath23 is extremely problematic due to severe infrared divergences .",
    "notably , perturbation theory for the pressure breaks down at order @xmath24 . for completeness",
    ", we briefly review linde s argument in the sequel .",
    "+    let us consider the contribution to the pressure from the @xmath25-loop diagram depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : linde_diagram ] .",
    "the leading infrared ( ir ) behavior comes from taking the matsubara zero mode for every line ; all other modes act as effective ir regulators . for the argument , it is sufficient to estimate its contribution to the pressure using a simple power counting strategy @xcite . in this spirit",
    ", we can neglect its tensorial structure and write this zero mode contribution schematically in the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the gluon 4-momentum and @xmath28 is the matsubara frequency .",
    "the origin of each factor is easy to trace : vertices contribute with @xmath29 , lines with a propagator @xmath30 , and loops with an integral .    in order to estimate the contribution from this diagram",
    ", we take @xmath5 as an ultraviolet cutoff since it would naturally arise if we were to sum over all matsubara frequencies due to the presence of statistical factors .",
    "also , as the diagrams are potentially ir divergent , one can not take arbitrarily soft modes into account ; we only integrate over momentum above a lower threshold @xmath31 .",
    "the diagrams are ir regular for @xmath32 and divergent for @xmath33 .",
    "namely , the dominant behavior for different values of @xmath34 are @xcite    [ eq : linde_result ] @xmath35    in perturbation theory , the coupling @xmath36 and the scale @xmath5 provide a natural hierarchy of energy scales : @xmath37 . using such hierarchy as a guideline",
    ", one can push @xmath31 deeper and deeper towards the ir region .",
    ".   shows that when @xmath31 reaches @xmath38 all diagrams with @xmath39 contribute at @xmath24 .",
    "in other words , perturbation theory breaks down since infinitely many diagrams have to be considered at a finite order , even if @xmath36 is taken to be arbitrarily small .",
    "the reasoning above ignores the possibility of screening masses being dynamically generated and , as a matter of fact , they are present in thermal yang - mills theory @xcite . in this context , a screening mass would work as a natural ir regulator , essentially playing the role of @xmath31 in eq .  .",
    "in the color electric sector , ir modes are screened as @xmath40 . on the other hand , from eq .",
    "one can see that a color magnetic mass @xmath41 makes all loops @xmath42 contribute to @xmath24 , which is interpreted as the breakdown of the perturbative expansion .",
    "this is the so - called linde problem of thermal yang - mills theory .",
    "now we consider pure glue @xmath0 yang - mills theory on @xmath20 .",
    "we define our coordinates as @xmath43 where @xmath44 corresponds to @xmath45 and @xmath46 $ ] and @xmath47 $ ] parametrize the torus .",
    "we note that the partition function is periodic in @xmath48 _ and _ @xmath49 and all observables in this theory should be invariant under radius exchange symmetry , i.e. , @xmath50 .",
    "the fourier decomposition of the yang - mills field is given by @xmath51 and , due to the presence of two compact dimensions , this system can be formally seen as kaluza - klein like tower of two - dimensional yang - mills theories coupled to two adjoint scalars for each one of the winding modes on the torus .",
    "we denote @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 represent these two adjoint scalars .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this theory has global @xmath56 center symmetry and two order parameters given by the wilson lines on the torus .",
    "one may consider the behavior of this theory in certain limits of the energy scales @xmath5 and @xmath8 :    * @xmath57 ( dimensional reduction ) : the adjoint scalars acquire a large mass and decouple from the low - energy effective theory , which becomes the exactly solvable two - dimensional yang - mills theory for the massless gluons along the two non - compact directions @xcite ; * @xmath58 , @xmath8 finite ( or @xmath59 , @xmath5 finite ) : one of the compact dimensions unwinds and the low - energy effective theory becomes three - dimensional yang - mills theory coupled to an adjoint scalar of mass @xmath60 ( or @xmath61 ) .",
    "these scenarios are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ diagrama ] . when @xmath59 , @xmath62 the two - point function of the color field tensor @xmath63 with components along the non - compact directions exhibits the usual screening for large spatial separations while when @xmath64 this correlator becomes non - propagating as in 2-dimensional yang - mills theory @xcite",
    ".    now we can address linde s problem in yang - mills theory on @xmath20 .",
    "as before , we estimate in a power counting scheme the dominant ir contribution of the linde diagrams , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : linde_diagram ] . in the present case",
    "there is not one but two compactified dimensions and , thus , in order to get the leading ir contribution we must take the zero modes associated with each circle for every line in the loop diagram .",
    "the equivalent of eq .",
    "is then @xmath65    as in section [ oldlinde ] , if we were to sum over all modes a natural uv cutoff would arise .",
    "such a hard scale is given as a function of the two energy scales related to the two compact directions , which we denote by @xmath66 .",
    "its exact dependence on @xmath8 and @xmath5 is not important for our argument though it must satisfy the radius exchange symmetry , @xmath67 .",
    "once again , due to the potential ir divergences of the linde diagrams , we only integrate over modes above a certain ir scale @xmath31 .",
    "the dominant ir behavior for different values of @xmath34 can be readily estimated :    [ eq : linde_result_torus ] @xmath68    as the problem now has two typical scales , one can no longer build a unique hierarchy of energy scales with the aid of the coupling constant .",
    "in fact , there are infinitely many hierarchies at our disposal , one for each possible combination of @xmath8 and @xmath5 with the proper dimension . nevertheless , for scales where @xmath69 , all linde diagrams with 3 or more loops contribute at @xmath9 , which indicates the breakdown of perturbation theory .",
    "thus , the presence of a second compactified dimension renders the linde problem in gauge theories even more severe .",
    "the fact that ir fluctuations have become stronger should be expected given the compact character of the space and the presence of an additional zero mode in the torus in comparison to the usual case of ym in @xmath11 . also , we note that the zero modes in the compact directions , though constant , have non - trivial commutators .",
    "a thorough discussion about these modes is , however , beyond the scope of the present note .    in the dimensional reduction limit ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath57 , the system becomes effectively yang - mills theory in two dimensions @xcite . in this case , one can write the partition function purely in terms of the field strengths @xmath70 ( bianchi s constraint is trivial in two dimensions ) @xcite , with a simple quadratic action @xmath71 whose field strengths fluctuate on the plane independently from one another . the pressure of this system can be solved exactly @xcite and it contains a term that goes as @xmath71 and , thus , it can not be simply expanded in perturbative powers of @xmath36 at weak coupling .",
    "we believe this may be the root behind the failure of naive perturbation theory at order @xmath72 found here for yang - mills theory on @xmath20 .",
    "we note that 2-dimensional yang - mills theory would also appear as a limit of the original 4-dimensional theory if the torus would be replaced by any compact surface with genus one , though the explicit construction of the linde problem in this case is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "perturbative expansions at finite temperature are plagued with ir divergences whenever massless bosonic fields are present @xcite .",
    "this situation is even more problematic in the case of thermal yang - mills theory since the linde problem essentially makes naive perturbation theory meaningless beyond @xmath24 .    thermal field theories , in the imaginary - time formalism ,",
    "are set in an euclidean space - time with a compact time direction . in this context",
    ", all thermal effects are ultimately encoded in the structure of the underlying space - time ( e.g. , @xmath11 ) . in order to better understand the role played by compactification in ir problems of non - abelian gauge theories",
    ", we included a second compact dimension and analyzed the behavior of yang - mills theory , providing an extension of linde s argument for the case where the compact part of space - time is the torus @xmath73 .",
    "our study shows that the linde problem in this case becomes much more severe , as it already emerges at @xmath9 for the pressure .",
    "this indicates that the perturbative expansion in yang - mills theory on @xmath20 faces important limitations since the lowest order correction to any physical observable will necessarily have a non - perturbative contribution even at arbitrarily small coupling .",
    "however , this system could be readily studied on the lattice and it would be interesting to investigate the phase diagram of this theory , depicted in fig .",
    "[ diagrama ] .",
    "one could compute on the lattice the glueball correlator and see its behavior changing from the well - known description in terms of screening masses when @xmath74 to the finite @xmath75 scenario addressed in this paper .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to see if the breakdown of perturbation theory induced by ir divergences in yang - mills theory indeed has a topological character .",
    "one could check if other compact surfaces with genus one ( which are then topologically equivalent to the torus considered here ) produce the same qualitative results for the pressure .",
    "while we can not rigorously prove it at this time , we conjecture that this is going to be the case because the dimensional reduction argument discussed here , which leads to 2-dimensional yang - mills theory , should also hold .",
    "additionally , compactifications of yang - mills theory on @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a compact surface with genus @xmath78 , may yet reveal other features that are not present in the simple torus example considered here .",
