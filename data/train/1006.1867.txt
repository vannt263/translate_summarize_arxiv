    "long - term systematic observations of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have produced detailed light curves that are a powerful tool for investigating the nature of these highly energetic phenomena .",
    "agns show variability across the full electromagnetic spectrum and multi - frequency monitoring programs serve to establish connections between flux variations at different energy bands .    the first comparison between long - term records of radio ( 10.7  ghz ) and optical fluxes for a sample of 24 agns @xcite showed a correlation in only 13 sources , with the optical events preceding radio by intervals of 0 to 14 months .",
    "subsequent analysis of light curves for 18 agns taken in the optical and radio ( 4.614.5  ghz ) domains @xcite demonstrated similar statistics : nine sources exhibited positive radio - optical correlations , with a time lag ranging from 0 to 14 months .",
    "@xcite reported on a correlation in 10 out of 22 sources comparing optical and radio ( 22230  ghz ) observations .",
    "remarkably , in 6 sources the variability was simultaneous .",
    "a more recent statistical study of the time delay between individual millimeter- and centimeter - wave flare peaks made by @xcite for a sample of 55 sources showed a large scatter of time lags that ranged up to several hundreds of days between 4.8 and 230  ghz , and tended to increase with decreasing radio frequency band .",
    "@xcite investigated the flaring behavior of the quasar 3c  454.3 and showed that optical outbursts led the 230  ghz flares by 1550 days , confirming an earlier result by @xcite , who found millimeter flux changes lagging behind the optical on a time scale of about 60 days . a longer delay of about ten months between optical and 37  ghz radio flux variations was reported in this source by @xcite . @xcite studied the connection between @xmath0-ray emission detected by egret and phases of corresponding radio flares at 22 and 37  ghz .",
    "they reported that the highest levels of @xmath0-ray emission were detected 3070 days after the onset of the high - frequency radio flare .    the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _",
    ", successfully launched in june 2008 , has opened a new era in @xmath0-ray astronomy .",
    "a number of agn radio/@xmath0-ray connections have been established on the basis of the first three months of _ fermi _  science operations and quasi - simultaneous vlbi observations , namely that the @xmath0-ray photon flux correlates with the parsec scale radio flux density @xcite , and that the jets of the lat - detected blazars have higher - than - average apparent speeds ( median of @xmath4 ; @xcite ) , larger apparent opening angles ( median of @xmath5 ; @xcite ) , and higher variability doppler factors ( mean of @xmath6 ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , agn jets tend to be found in a more active radio state within several months of the lat - detection of their strong @xmath0-ray emission @xcite . a significant correlation was detected even between non - simultaneous measurements of @xmath1  gev photon flux and 8  ghz vlba flux density @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , there are several key questions that remain to be addressed , which include : ( i ) the dominant production mechanism(s ) of @xmath0-ray photons , ( ii ) the exact location of the high - energy emission , and ( iii ) the nature of the agn @xmath0-ray duty cycle . in this letter",
    "we investigate the radio/@xmath0-ray time delays for parsec - scale jets and place constraints on the localization of the region where most of the @xmath0-ray photons are produced .    throughout this letter",
    ", we use the term `` core '' as the apparent origin of agn jets that commonly appears as the brightest feature in vlbi images of blazars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mojave program @xcite is a long - term vlba project to study the total intensity structure changes and polarization evolution of extragalactic relativistic radio jets in the northern sky .",
    "the observed sources include a statistically complete , flux - density limited sample of 135 agns ( mojave-1 ) .",
    "all the mojave-1 sources have j2000 declination @xmath7 and a 15  ghz vlba correlated flux density @xmath8  jy ( 2  jy for @xmath9 ) at any epoch between 1994.0 and 2004.0 . the weaker radio blazars ( @xmath10  jy ) detected by _ fermi _",
    "extend the complete mojave-1 sample to mojave-2 .",
    "the monitoring list currently consists of 293 sources , 186 of which are members of the first _ fermi _  lat catalog ( 1fgl , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that are positionally associated with agns .",
    "we note that the 186 sources do not represent a complete sample selected on either parsec - scale radio flux density or @xmath0-ray photon flux .",
    "apart from the median @xmath0-ray photon and energy fluxes , the 1fgl catalog provides flux history data , in the form of monthly binned @xmath1  gev photon flux measurements during the first 11 months of the _ fermi _  scientific operations , which started on 2008 august 4 .",
    "the time sampling of our vlba radio observations is source - dependent : objects with more rapid structural changes ( i.e. , faster apparent speeds ) are observed more frequently .",
    "there are only five sources in our sample that are monitored with a cadence more frequent than once every two months . starting in early 2009 , fifty five bright @xmath0-ray detections ( @xmath11 ) from the _ fermi _  lat 3-month list positionally associated with bright radio - loud blazars",
    "@xcite have been incrementally added to the mojave program .",
    "more than half of these new lat - detected sources have fewer than three epochs of radio observations during the _ fermi _  era , which precludes the correlation analysis of individual light curves .",
    "therefore , our study is based upon a statistical approach .",
    "overall , we obtained 564 vlba images and corresponding model fits for 183 bright @xmath0-ray sources ( table  [ t : sample ] ) within a period from june 2008 through march 2010 .",
    "the parsec - scale structure , typically represented by a one - sided core - jet morphology , was fitted with the procedure _ modelfit _ in the difmap package @xcite using a limited number of primarily circular gaussian components , as described by @xcite .",
    "we tested for possible correlations between the @xmath0-ray photon fluxes and 15  ghz vlba core flux densities using the following procedure : ( i ) we selected all pairs of measurements where the difference in the radio and @xmath0-ray epochs lay within a restricted time interval , for instance , @xmath12 $ ] month , where the negative sign indicates that the radio measurement precedes the @xmath0-ray one , ( ii ) if more than one pair of fluxes was available for a source , we selected the one with the epoch difference closest to the mean of the time interval .",
    "the procedure was then repeated iteratively by shifting the time interval by 0.5  month each time .",
    "we performed a quantative analysis that confirmed that our data do not provide any bias towards positive pairs of radio/@xmath0-ray epoch difference .",
    "we used a cutoff of @xmath13 for the @xmath0-ray photon flux measurements to avoid a bias due to the lack of sources that are both weak in radio and @xmath0-rays , and to exclude the influence of low - quality data points . for each data set we calculated the pearson s @xmath2 and non - parametric kendall s @xmath3 correlation coefficients , together with a corresponding probability of a chance correlation ( table  [ t : corr_stat ] ) . a non - zero radio/@xmath0-ray time lag , clearly seen as a bump in the correlation versus delay curves ( fig .",
    "[ f : gr_delay ] , left top panel ) , ranges from 1 to 8 months .",
    "the smooth fitted curves were obtained by applying a three point moving average .",

    "thus , we applied randomization techniques based on permutation tests to construct confidence intervals on the correlation coefficients . for each data set the randomization",
    "was done in the following manner : ( i ) we randomly swapped the radio measurements for one source with another source , keeping the @xmath0-ray fluxes the same ; ( ii ) we calculated correlation coefficients @xmath2 and @xmath3 from the randomized data .",
    "we then repeated these steps 2000 times . a 95% confidence interval ( given in table  [ t : corr_stat ] ) for the correlation coefficients",
    "was defined as the interval spanning from the 2.5-th to the 97.5-th percentile of the re - sampled @xmath2 and @xmath3 values . to estimate the null - basis level of the flux - flux correlation ( which is present due to an overall radio/@xmath0-ray correlation ; see   [ localization ] ) , we shuffled the @xmath0-ray photon fluxes among the 11 measurements available for every source , keeping the epoch dates and radio flux densities the same .",

    "the delay is also affected by geometry , including the angle of the jets to our line of sight and the wide range of redshifts in our sample .",
    "the redshifts are known for more than 90% of the sources ( 166 out of 183 ) .",
    "we re - did the analysis in the source s frame by dividing the radio/@xmath0-ray epoch time difference for each source by a factor of @xmath155 .",
    "this gave a typical time delay of @xmath156 months in the source frame ( fig .",
    "[ f : gr_delay ] , right ) , which corresponds to @xmath157 months ( for @xmath158 ) in the observer s frame .",
    "the other sub - peaks are not significantly different from the null level of correlation , though they may indicate longer delays in a smaller number of sources .",
    "note that the points on the radio/@xmath0-ray correlation curve are dependent .",
    "we expect the smearing even in the source frame delay because the core size is redshift dependent : more distant sources have higher rest - frame frequencies and , therefore should have a smaller core radius and shorter rest - frame delay .",
    "this effect can potentially be studied in more detail using a larger sample subdivided into high- and low - redshift bins . since a distribution of different delay values",
    "is expected , we do not estimate an error range on the detected peak .",
    "the peak value should only be taken as a typical one for the agns in our sample .    in figure",
    "[ f : flux - flux ] we plot the integrated @xmath1  gev @xmath0-ray photon flux against the 15  ghz vlba core flux density for data pairs in which the @xmath0-ray measurement leads the radio measurement by @xmath159 months in the observer s frame .",
    "the formal probability of a chance correlation is @xmath160 .",
    "if we drop the points with photon flux greater than @xmath161  ph  @xmath162  s@xmath163 , the correlation is still present at a very high level of significance .",
    "we also note the span over one order of magnitude in the @xmath0-ray fluxes for a given radio flux density .",
    "several factors can contribute to this scatter : the shape of the @xmath0-ray spectrum , k - correction effects , different seed photons , and different doppler boosting levels in the @xmath0-ray and radio domains @xcite .",
    "although radio loud agn are generally known to have twin jet structures , the sources in our sample typically have a one - sided parsec - scale morphology @xcite , implying strong selection effects and doppler boosting of the jet emission .",
    "localization of the @xmath0-ray emission region within the agn radio structure and its physical production mechanism(s ) remain topics of active debate .",
    "there are three possibilities for the site of the high - energy emission : ( a ) only within the unresolved radio core , ( b ) only in the resolved ( downstream ) jet region , ( c ) both in the core and jet .",
    "repeating the same analysis as in   [ s : rg_core ] for the total vlba flux density , we found that the corresponding correlation coefficients agree within the 95% errors with those found for the core flux densities .",
    "thus , no firm conclusions can be drawn out of this comparison . indeed , the sources in our sample are highly core dominated , with a median value of @xmath164 , where @xmath165 and @xmath166 are the core and total vlba flux density , respectively . by contrast ,",
    "when the jet flux densities ( @xmath167 ) are used , the correlation coefficients are significantly lower , making scenario ( b ) less probable . to reduce the uncertainty in the jet flux density estimations we excluded sources with a high ( @xmath168 ) core dominance . nevertheless , the correlation between the jet flux densities measured quasi - simultaneously with the @xmath0-ray photon flux is still significant .",
    "this could be the result of both radio and @xmath0-ray regimes being boosted by similar beaming factors @xcite .",
    "assuming the same doppler factor for the jet and the core ( opaque jet base ) , we would expect a weak but significant correlation between the jet flux density and integral @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that for some low - redshift sources , @xmath0-ray emission may also be produced outside the radio core , as could be the case in 3c84 @xcite , where radio flare accompanying the @xmath0-ray activity was detected in the innermost jet region .",
    "we note that @xcite found a correlation between the _ fermi _  lat @xmath1  gev photon flux from the three - month integration and 8  ghz radio flux density _ non - simultaneously _ measured by the vlba .",
    "the presence of this correlation in this highly variable population further suggests that doppler beaming is the likely cause , and that the doppler factors of the individual jets are not changing substantially over time .",
    "what is the main source of the detected time lag ?",
    "dispersion in the intervening medium can not be responsible for a delay of several months .",
    "our calculations following the crab pulsar measurement by @xcite show that for an object at a redshift @xmath169 the delay should not exceed a few seconds at 15  ghz .",
    "the most likely source of the observed time lag is synchrotron opacity in the nuclear region .",
    "the radio core is optically thick to synchrotron emission up to the frequency - dependent radius @xmath170 @xcite .",
    "this means that the @xmath0-ray production region / zone is located upstream with respect to the 15  ghz apparent core position .",
    "being induced by the same disturbance at a distance @xmath171 from the black hole , the radio and @xmath0-ray emission at their peaks are not observed simultaneously due to the opacity effect .",
    "although the @xmath0-ray photons escape immediately , it takes several more months for the perturbation to propagate farther along the jet until it reaches the @xmath172 surface at 15  ghz radio emission ( the radio core ) , and becomes detectable at radio frequencies . the corresponding distance travelled along the jet between the place where a @xmath0-ray photon was emitted ( @xmath171 ) and",
    "the radius of the radio core ( @xmath173 ) is @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the doppler factor , @xmath176 is the lorentz factor , @xmath177 is the intrinsic jet speed , and @xmath178 is the observed time delay . using the relations for doppler factor @xmath175 and apparent angular speed @xmath179 @xcite , the expression ( 1 ) can also be written in the form @xmath180 where @xmath179 is the apparent jet speed , @xmath181 is the radio to @xmath0-ray time delay in the source s frame , and @xmath182 is the viewing angle . since we can not measure radio/@xmath0-ray time delays for the sources individually from our data , let us consider a source with a set of parameters typical for a lat - detected radio - loud blazar : apparent jet speed @xmath183 @xcite , viewing angle @xmath184 @xcite , and a typical time lag of 1.2 months in the source s frame . under these assumptions",
    "we obtain the distance between the @xmath0-ray production zone and the @xmath185 surface at 15  ghz , the radio core , @xmath186  pc , which corresponds to a projected distance of @xmath187  pc , or @xmath188  mas for a source at @xmath158 .",
    "these estimates are consistent with the core radius obtained from the frequency dependent core shift measurements @xcite .",
    "this indicates that vlbi observations at higher frequencies , for instance at 43  ghz and 86  ghz , should register shorter delay or even quasi - simultaneous flux variations with @xmath0-ray flux at least for some sources , and might even resolve the region of the jet where @xmath0-ray emission is generated .",
    "the fact that the radio emitting region may be more physically extended than the @xmath0-ray emission zone may also contribute to the detected delay .",
    "finally , we note that our analysis is sensitive to the delay between the peaks at radio and @xmath0-ray frequencies , but can not address which flare , low- or high - energy , originates first .",
    "the latter analysis requires very well - sampled light curves for a large set of @xmath0-ray - detected agn .",
    "we have investigated the dependence between the integrated @xmath1  gev @xmath0-ray photon flux and 15  ghz radio flux densities for a large sample of 183 lat - detected agns observed by the vlba within the mojave program and conclude the following .",
    "the correlation between @xmath0-ray photon flux and radio flux density is found to be highly significant .",
    "the correlation analysis results for the core and total vlba flux density are indistinguishable .",
    "the correlation is systematically weaker if the jet flux density is used , providing further support for the localization of the @xmath0-ray emission to the core region as well as a connection between the inverse - compton @xmath0-rays and the synchrotron radio emission from the jet .",
    "we found a non - zero radio/@xmath0-ray delay ( @xmath0-ray leads the radio emission ) that ranges from 1 to 8 months in the observer s frame and peaks at @xmath156 months in the source frame .",
    "the delay is most likely connected with synchrotron opacity in the core region , although other mechanisms may play a role .",
    "the region where most of @xmath0-ray photons are produced is found to be located within the compact opaque parsec - scale core .",
    "the typical distance between the @xmath0-ray production region and the 15  ghz radio core is estimated to be @xmath189  pc , which is consistent with the typical core radius derived from frequency dependent core shift measurements .",
    "these results are consistent with earlier findings reported by @xcite and @xcite which place further constraints on the localization of the @xmath0-ray production zone in parsec - scale jets .",
