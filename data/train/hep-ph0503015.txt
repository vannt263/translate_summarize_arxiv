    "in recent years , there has been considerable experimental and theoretical interest in semi - inclusive hard processes , from which one hopes to learn important information about the nucleon structure and non - perturbative dynamics of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "rigorous theoretical studies in this direction started with the classical work on semi - inclusive processes in @xmath0 annihilation by collins and soper in @xcite , where a qcd factorization has been proved , and nonperturbative transverse - momentum - dependent ( tmd ) parton distributions and fragmentation functions were introduced @xcite .",
    "the approach has been applied to semi - inclusive drell - yan production at hadron colliders in @xcite and to semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) in @xcite , in both cases with transverse momentum much larger than @xmath1 . meanwhile ,",
    "spin - dependent tmd parton distributions and fragmentation functions were introduced in various processes , which can generate polarization asymmetries in semi - inclusive scattering . in the past few years , gauge properties of the tmd parton distributions have been investigated , and the result provided a firm theoretical basis for studying the tmd parton distributions .",
    "more recently , the factorization theorems for the semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) and drell - yan processes have been re - examined in the context of the gauge - invariant definitions @xcite .    in semi - inclusive",
    "dis and drell - yan processes , the quark tmd distributions produce the dominant contribution , while the contribution from the gluon distributions is power - suppressed @xcite . however , as a fundamental observable of the nucleon , the gluon tmd distributions contain unique non - perturbative information , and contribute to a distinct class of semi - inclusive processes@xcite .",
    "for example , a jet - jet correlation asymmetry in single - transversely - polarized - hadron - hadron scattering may reveal the role of the so - called gluon  sivers function \" @xcite .",
    "hence it is essential to have a thorough theoretical understanding of the gluon tmd distributions and related factorization theorems for gluon - related semi - inclusive processes .",
    "in general , however , qcd factorization for generic hard processes ( e.g. , heavy - flavor and jet production ) at hadron colliders is far more complicated than that for dis and drell - yan processes @xcite . as a first step ,",
    "we consider here scalar - particle production at hadron colliders through gluon fusion .",
    "we assume that the scalar particle ( e.g. higgs boson ) couples to gluons at the leading order of an effective theory .",
    "all - order qcd corrections are taken into account in a factorization theorem .",
    "this process is similar to drell - yan production in that the observed particles have no final - state strong interactions , and thus qcd factorization can be studied in a similar manner . in this paper , we focus on the region of low transverse momentum where the tmd parton distributions are relevant .",
    "it is well - known that for a transverse momentum @xmath2 where @xmath3 being some hard scale in the problem ( the scalar particle mass square @xmath4 in the present case ) , there exist large logarithms of type @xmath5 in high - order perturbative calculations .",
    "to have reliable predictions , we must re - sum these large logarithms .",
    "in the present framework , resummation can be achieved by solving the collins - soper evolution equation for the tmd parton distributions @xcite .",
    "we will illustrate how to achieve the resummation for scalar - particle production at the relevant transverse momentum .",
    "one interesting example of the scalar particle is the standard model higgs boson , whose discovery is among the most important endeavors for the future high - energy collider experiments . in the standard model ,",
    "higgs boson production at hadron colliders is dominated by the gluon fusion process : it couples to two gluons through quark loops , with the dominating contribution from the top quark loop .",
    "this coupling can be described by an effective theory this effective theory is valid at the heavy quark limit , and in practice it works very well at the higgs mass range of @xmath6 @xcite . in the past few years",
    ", there have been extensive discussions about higgs production in this effective theory approach , with the next - to - next - to - leading order corrections being calculated .",
    "resummation of large logarithm at low transverse momentum was studied by various authors in the literature . in our study",
    ", we use the same effective theory for the coupling between the scalar and gluons .",
    "we start with the factorization analysis of scalar - particle production at small transverse momentum . for higgs boson production at large transverse momentum ,",
    "we compare our result to the previous calculations with the resummation effects at one - loop order . in our analysis",
    ", large logarithms will appear in the tmd parton distributions , and they are resummed by solving the corresponding collins - soper evolution equation .",
    "the resummation coefficient functions can be calculated directly from the factorization formula .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we discuss tmd gluon distributions .",
    "first , we provide a gauge - invariant definition of the unpolarized distribution .",
    "we then calculate it to one - loop order in feynman gauge .",
    "we show that the one - loop result is free of the soft divergence , and obeys the collins - soper evolution equation . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss in detail the connection between tmd and integrated parton ( quark and gluon ) distributions . in sec .",
    "iv , we consider semi - inclusive scalar particle production at hadron colliders through the gluon fusion process , where an effective gluon - scalar vertex is introduced .",
    "we calculate the differential cross section and illustrate factorization at one - loop order .",
    "the relevant hard and soft factors are also calculated . in sec .",
    "v , resummation of large logarithms is performed by solving the relevant collins - soper equations .",
    "we conclude and discuss future prospects in sec . vi .",
    "in this section , we study transverse - momentum - dependent gluon distribution , which is an important ingredient for scalar - particle production at hadron colliders .",
    "the discussion follows closely our previous work on the quark tmd distributions in semi - inclusive dis @xcite .",
    "we first provide a gauge - invariant definition of the spin - independent tmd gluon distribution .",
    "we then calculate it in perturbation theory to one - loop order , and show that it obeys the collins - soper evolution equation .",
    "we focus the discussion on the unpolarized gluon tmd distributions .",
    "however , the results can easily be generalized to the polarized tmd gluon distributions @xcite , with which one can study the various polarization asymmetries at hadron colliders .",

    "such a light - cone gauge link , however , introduces the light - cone singularities @xcite .",
    "the gauge link is therefore chosen to be slightly off the light cone to regulate these singularities @xcite . with a non - light - like @xmath19",
    ", the tmd distribution depends on a new scalar @xmath22 . in light - cone coordinates , @xmath23 and",

    "[ one can , of course , choose a gauge link pointing to the future to define a similar distribution relevant , for example , for dis . ] in nonsingular gauges , the transverse gauge link vanishes because gauge potentials fall off rapidly at space - time infinity @xcite . in a singular gauge ,",
    "e.g. the light - cone gauge , gauge potentials do not vanish at space - time infinity , so we have to include the transverse gauge link to guarantee gauge invariance @xcite . in the following calculations , for simplicity",
    ", we will work in feynman gauge in which the transverse gauge link does not contribute .",
