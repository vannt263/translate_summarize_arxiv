    "ram pressure stripping was first proposed by @xcite to explain the observed absence of gas - rich galaxies in clusters .",
    "they noted that galaxies falling into clusters feel an intracluster medium ( icm ) wind .",
    "if this wind can overcome the gravitational attraction between the stellar and gas disks , then the gas disk will be blown away .",
    "they introduced a simple analytical condition to determine when gas is lost : @xmath2 the right - hand side , @xmath3 , is a gravitational restoring pressure , @xmath4 is the density of the icm , and @xmath5 is the orbital speed of the satellite galaxy . using this condition they concluded that spirals should lose their gas disks when they pass through the centers of clusters .",
    "galaxies near cluster centers have earlier type morphologies , are redder , and form fewer stars than galaxies in the field of similar luminosity  @xcite .",
    "stripped galaxies have low h i masses for their size and morphology .",
    "such h i deficiency correlates with lower star formation rates ( sfrs )  @xcite , and lowered sfrs lead to redder colors .",
    "therefore , ram pressure stripping , in conjunction with processes like harassment that can alter the structure of a galaxy , may play a role in transforming galaxy morphologies .",
    "several sets of observations indicate that stripping occurs to spirals in clusters .",
    "@xcite define a deficiency parameter that compares a galaxy s observed h i mass to the expected h i mass in a field galaxy with the same morphology and optical size .",
    "galaxies in virgo ,  @xcite , coma ,  @xcite , and other nearby clusters ,  @xcite are observed to be h i deficient .",
    "@xcite observe that the average deficiency increases with decreasing distance to the clusters centers and that deficient galaxies have , on average , more eccentric orbits .",
    "@xcite observe indications of stripping in the h i distributions of individual galaxies in the virgo cluster . compared to an average profile for a field galaxy of similar morphology and optical extent , these galaxies have normal gas densities in their inner disks but are sharply truncated . more detailed observations of several virgo spirals have since been carried out .",
    "ngc 4522 is observed to have an undisturbed optical disk , a severely truncated h i disk , and extra planar h@xmath6 and h i on one side of the disk  @xcite .",
    "ic 3392 , ngc 4402 , ngc 4419 , and ngc 4388 all have a truncated h i disk , and the first three have extraplanar h i  @xcite .",
    "ngc 4569 has a truncated h i disk and extra planar h@xmath6  @xcite .",
    "observing asymmetric , extraplanar gas in combination with an undisturbed optical disk is a strong indication that the galaxy s gas is interacting with the icm .",
    "detailed simulations of ram pressure stripping confirm that spirals in clusters should be stripped .",
    "for some simulations the final radii of the galaxies are compared to the predictions of the gunn and gott condition .",
    "in addition , the morphologies of simulated galaxies have been compared to observations of spirals in virgo .",
    "simulations by  @xcite show that galaxies in a face - on wind are stripped to radii near those predicted by the gunn and gott condition , but galaxies in an edge - on wind are only mildly stripped . in contrast , other simulations show a two - step stripping process that strips galaxies at all inclination angles .",
    "ram pressure stripping first quickly strips gas from the outer disk , and then the remaining disk is slowly viscously stripped  @xcite .",
    "@xcite point out that , unlike ram pressure stripping , viscous stripping is more effective in an edge - on wind .",
    "they find that the final radii of the face - on galaxies match those predicted using the gunn and gott condition and that edge - on galaxies are stripped to slightly larger radii .",
    "@xcite run a series of simulations to test the dependence of the stripping radius on the speed of the icm wind , the mach number , and the vertical structure of the gas disk .",
    "they find that the most important parameters are the ram pressure and surface density of the gas disk and that the effects of varying the mach number and vertical structure are minor .",
    "they find that the original gunn and gott condition does a fair job predicting the stripping radius .",
    "however , when they use an adjusted ram pressure , they find that using the thermodynamic pressure in the central plane of the disk more accurately predicts the stripping radius .    simulations of ram pressure stripping can also match the range of morphologies of stripped galaxies .",
    "@xcite track the density , velocity , and velocity dispersion of a simulated galaxy s cold disk gas . in ngc 4522 , the kinetically continuous extraplanar gas matches simulations of a galaxy that is currently being stripped .",
    "however , the gas in ngc 4569 is less pronounced , not kinetically continuous with the disk gas , and has a large velocity dispersion , more like simulations of a galaxy that has been stripped in the past . in their simulations",
    "@xcite observe a process they term `` annealing '' .",
    "the icm wind compresses the gas disk and triggers the formation of large spiral arms .",
    "the interaction of these arms with the wind leads to the contraction of the galaxy and the formation of a dense truncated gas disk .",
    "a burst of star formation may occur at the edge of the truncated disk .",
    "a ring of star formation is seen at the truncation radius of the disk in ic 3392 .",
    "some groups have studied stripping in groups and cluster outskirts where the ram pressure is lower than in cluster centers . while simulations and observations both support the idea that large spirals in clusters are stripped of their h i disks , it is not clear that stripping occurs in poorer environments .",
    "two types of stripping may occur in groups .",
    "the ram pressure in groups is lower than in clusters .",
    "however , dwarf galaxies have lower masses than large spirals and therefore lower restoring pressures , and dwarf galaxies may be stripped of most of their h i. in addition , large spirals have restoring pressures that decrease with radius and may be stripped of their outer disks .",
    "@xcite run simulations of dwarf - like galaxies in winds typical of the ram pressure in groups and find that the simulated dwarfs are stripped .",
    "the @xcite simulations include runs with low ram pressure .",
    "their large and medium - sized model spirals are stripped of some of their outer h i in these runs .",
    "the observational evidence for stripping in low - mass systems is circumstantial .",
    "the gas content and star formation histories of local group dwarfs correlate with their distances from the dominant spirals  @xcite .",
    "this project aims to use the clear observations of stripping in clusters to predict when stripping occurs in groups .",
    "this is done by examining how the ram and restoring pressures depend on the masses of the cluster or group and the satellite galaxy .",
    "two ways in which the masses of the host system and satellite galaxy affect the ram and restoring pressures are identified .",
    "satellites orbital speeds are set by the depth of the cluster s potential , and the restoring force on the gas disk is determined by the depth of the satellite s potential . in addition , both cluster and galaxy morphologies change with mass .",
    "a model is developed and used to study both types of mass dependence .",
    "this is done in the following steps .    in the next section a model for the mass and gas distributions",
    "is presented both in terms of physical parameters and in terms of scale - free parameters . in section 3 the dependence of ram pressure stripping on the masses of the satellite and cluster",
    "is presented assuming that the scale - free parameters are constant . in section 4 the dependence of the scale - free parameters on the masses of the satellite and cluster and the sensitivity of the model to these changes are explored . in section 5",
    "the results are discussed and the model is compared to observations of stripping .",
    "section 6 concludes .",
    "the analytical model of ram pressure stripping developed here uses the gunn and gott condition to predict the extent to which galaxies are stripped .",
    "this condition is based on a simplified picture of stripping that ignores the details of the hydrodynamical processes and balances forces on large scales .",
    "however , simulations of galaxies that are stripped by a face - on wind result in stripping radii that match the predictions of the gunn and gott condition  @xcite . in the simulations galaxies in an edge on wind",
    "are eventually viscously stripped to radii similar to those of face - on , ram pressure stripped galaxies .",
    "this is discussed further in section  [ sec inclination ] . in light of the general agreement between gunn and gott s condition and simulations of ram pressure stripping",
    ", it is assumed that a model based on this condition can be used to make general statements about where and to what extent galaxies are stripped .",
    "the model for the group or cluster has two components , a gravitational potential in which the satellite orbits and an icm against which the satellite shocks .",

    "the h i is modeled as a thin flat disk with mass @xmath36 , surface density , @xmath37 , and a sharp cutoff at radius @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the fractional mass of the gas and @xmath42 is the scaled size of the disk",
    ".    the inner gas disk is dominated by the @xmath43 disk .",
    "the molecular disk is significantly more difficult to strip than the h i disk both because the @xmath43 disk is more compact and because the @xmath43 is found in molecular clouds .",
    "these clouds do not feel the effect of stripping as strongly as the diffuse h i. how stripping of @xmath43 occurs and how the @xmath43 clouds and diffuse h i in the inner disk interact are not known .",
    "the two phases may be tied together by magnetic fields ; in which case the inner h i disk will remain until the ram pressure can remove the entire inner disk .",
    "it may also be possible for the wind to remove the h i from the inner disk while leaving the @xmath43 behind .",
    "because of this uncertainty , the stripping of the inner disk will not be studied here .",
    "the model is only used to discuss stripping beyond 1.5 stellar scale lengths .",
    "if the ram pressure is not strong enough to affect the @xmath43 , the @xmath43 will contribute to the restoring pressure in the outer disk .",
    "therefore , the mass of the @xmath43 disk is added to the stellar mass .",
    "the emphasis of this project is to study the stripping of the h i disk .",
    "however , the fate of the hot galactic halo can also influence the evolution of the stripped galaxy .",

    "varying @xmath57 between 12 and 20 varies the @xmath93 at which stripping occurs by a factor of @xmath173 .",
    "the concentration also alters how the hot galactic halo is stripped . in a more concentrated dark matter halo",
    "the gas is denser in the center and more diffuse elsewhere .",
    "stripping can therefore occur down to a smaller radius , but a smaller fraction of the gas is lost .      how disk scale lengths vary with @xmath0 is an open question .",
    "theory suggests that when cold gas disks form in dark matter halos , their initial radii are proportional to the virial radii of the halos they form in  @xcite .",
    "there is a large scatter in this relationship that is due to a large scatter in the disk angular momenta .",
    "however , cold disks are composed of a combination of stars and gas , and how these components arise from the original cold disk is not understood .    the fraction of the h i that is found in the outer disk , where the restoring force from the stellar disk is weakest , is set by the ratio @xmath174 ( eqs .",

    "these observations suggest that @xmath174 contributes to the scatter in @xmath93 , but not to the mass dependence .",
    "varying @xmath174 changes both the size and the shape of the restoring force . when @xmath82 is held at 5.7 and @xmath177 is decreased to 3.5 , the restoring force decreases within @xmath178 and increases at larger @xmath161 .",
    "the fractional change in @xmath179 is less than 1.1 throughout the disk . holding @xmath82 constant and increasing @xmath177 to 8.5 , results in decreasing the restoring force outside of @xmath180 by a factor of less than 1.13 .",
    "varying @xmath82 while holding @xmath174 constant changes the density of both the gas and stellar disks . at a given @xmath181 , the density of both disks @xmath182 and the restoring pressure @xmath183 .",
    "the scatter in @xmath82 and how @xmath82 evolves with mass are not known .",

    "increasing @xmath82 from @xmath184 to @xmath185 decreases the @xmath93 needed for stripping by a factor of 20 .",
    "the presence of molecular gas complicates the physics of stripping in the inner disk .",
    "therefore , this model is only applied to disk radii beyond 1.5 stellar disk scale lengths . at these radii , @xmath186 ,",
    "the bulge acts as a point mass , and changing @xmath187 ( eq .  [ bulge 2 ] ) has no effect .",
    "in particular , the radius of the bulge changes with the mass of the bulge .",
    "below , the mass of the bulge is allowed to vary by 40% .",

    "this is not noticeable in the outer h i disk .",
    "both @xmath190 and @xmath81 ( eqs .",
    "[ bulge 2 ] and  [ sigma not ] ) are correlated with the mass of the satellite .",

    "very low mass spiral galaxies exist that do not contain any bulge  @xcite and dwarf galaxies are observed to be either de / dsph or dirr .",
    "in addition , low - mass late - type galaxies have a higher fraction of their mass in the gas disk than large spirals  @xcite .",
    "decreasing @xmath190 reduces the restoring pressure in the outer disk .",

    "the original model corresponds to a large late - type spiral , while the bulgeless model is closer to a late - type dwarf galaxy . because the restoring force due to the bulge is small , the net effect is to increase the restoring pressure .",

    "variations in the @xmath78 values should be correlated because the variation in the mass in baryons in a satellite is likely smaller than the variation in the mass of a given component .",
    "the correlation is such that it will reduce the overall scatter .",
    "in this section , the @xmath93 values at which the model predicts stripping should occur are compared to observations of h i disks from  @xcite .",

    "the observed fraction of spirals with @xmath198 reaches 0.3 at @xmath206 and 0.45 at @xmath207 .",
    "the model predicts that almost all galaxies within @xmath208 have @xmath198 .",
    "however , only @xmath209 of the galaxies viewed within @xmath210 actually reside within @xmath210 .",
    "this estimate assumes that the galaxy distribution follows an nfw profile and that all galaxies within @xmath211 are included in the projected cluster . at @xmath212 ,",
    "the model predicts that an average galaxy traveling face - on to the wind is stripped to @xmath198 for @xmath213 .",
    "this estimate can be roughly adjusted for inclination by multiplying by @xmath214 , @xmath215 .",
    "approximately 45% of the galaxies seen within @xmath212 actually reside within @xmath212 .",
    "some galaxies beyond the @xmath66 under consideration will be stripped to @xmath198 .",

    "this condition is met for @xmath212 if at least a third of the observed spirals have @xmath216 , corresponding to @xmath217 . for @xmath208 ,",
    "the volume fraction is lower than the observed fraction and this condition is easily met .",
    "the difference between the observed value and product of the volume fraction and stripped fraction should decrease as @xmath66 increases . a @xmath218 spiral traveling face - on to the wind",

    "a @xmath221 spiral traveling face - on to the wind is stripped to @xmath219 at @xmath222 .",
    "spirals with @xmath219 are not observed in the  @xcite sample outside of @xmath223 .",
    "the model does a good job of matching the observations of h i disks from  @xcite .",
    "if the model over - predicted the degree of stripping , then it would over - predict the fraction of spirals with @xmath198 and predict deficiencies at large radii greater than those observed .",
    "if the model under - predicted the degree of stripping , then it might not predict that spirals in the center of the cluster can have @xmath219 and would require that a larger fraction of the observed spirals reside in the cluster center .",
    "both  @xcite and  @xcite run simulations of disk galaxies in winds typical of the outskirts of a group , equivalent to @xmath212 and 0.7 , and the center of a group , @xmath224 and 0.25 . in marcolini",
    "the two lowest mass simulated dwarfs are completely stripped in the high ram pressure . in the other cases , the dwarfs are partially stripped to a range of radii .",
    "when the gas surface density in the current model is adjusted to the exponential gas density in the dwarf models , the current model and the simulations match well for both @xmath66 .",
    "the only disparity is that for @xmath224 the high - mass model is stripped to @xmath225 in the simulations and to @xmath226 in the model .",
    "this is probably due to differing dark matter halo profiles .",
    "the high - mass , @xmath227 , galaxy model of roedinger and hensler is stripped to @xmath228 in the lower ram pressure and @xmath229 in the higher ram pressure . after the gas density is adjusted , the stripping radii of their high - mass model in the two winds are matched well by the model .      in this model there",
    "exist three stripping regimes , stripping of the hot galactic halo , the flat h i disk , and the inner gas disk .",
    "the focus is on stripping of the flat h i disk .",
    "however , the model also includes a hot galactic halo .",
    "this hot gas is easily stripped in all environments .",
    "a satellite galaxy that is orbiting at @xmath230 and has a hot galactic halo consisting of 0.5% of its mass , is stripped of at least @xmath231 of its hot halo . at @xmath172 , a typical pericenter ,",
    "all satellite galaxies are stripped of practically their entire halo in both groups and clusters .",
    "the stripping of the inner disk has not been studied . however",
    ", this gas should be difficult to strip and any spiral that has not been stripped of its entire outer h i disk should retain this gas .",
    "the rest of this section focuses on the outer disk .",
    "the model does a reasonable job of matching h i observations in large cluster spirals .",
    "therefore , it can be used to predict the extent of stripping at different @xmath0 and @xmath1 . the model s",
    "basic prediction , that the stripping radius is determined by the ratio @xmath93 is modified by the mass dependence of the model s parameters .",
    "therefore , the usefulness of the model s predictions depends in part on how well this dependence is understood .",
    "fortunately , the mass dependence of many of the parameters is based on observations .",
    "the model parameters that most alter @xmath232 in low - mass systems are the icm profile parameters and the distribution of mass in the galaxy . the scaled ram pressure , @xmath233 , that a satellite experiences decreases with @xmath1 because the icm density throughout most of the cluster decreases .",
    "the scaled restoring pressure , @xmath234 , is larger in low - mass disks because a higher fraction of the disk mass is found in the h i disk .",
    "the changes in both the scaled ram and restoring pressures act to decrease the @xmath93 at which stripping occurs in low - mass systems .",
    "for example , the local group dwarfs have @xmath93 smaller than the bright spirals in virgo but should experience similar amounts of stripping .",
    "the model makes three basic predictions .",
    "dwarf galaxies are stripped of their entire outer h i disks in clusters and lose varying fractions of their outer disk in groups .",
    "massive spirals can also be stripped of significant fractions of their h i disk in groups if they travel to small @xmath66 . in a @xmath108 group ,",
    "a @xmath235 dwarf is stripped of 50% of its h i disk at @xmath236 , a @xmath218 satellite is similarly stripped at either @xmath208 or @xmath172 , depending on the satellite model used , and a large @xmath237 satellite is similarly stripped at @xmath238 .",
    "the corresponding orbits from stripping 80% of the h i disk are @xmath239 , 0.35 , 0.25 , and 0.2 .",
    "it should be kept in mind that these numbers are for an average satellite traveling face - on to the icm wind .",
    "the degree of stripping that a particular satellite of mass @xmath0 experiences orbiting in a cluster of mass @xmath1 can vary greatly .",
    "the parameters that are responsible for most of the variation in @xmath109 are the icm parameters , @xmath6 , @xmath11 , @xmath126 , the galaxy s inclination , @xmath162 , the pericenter , @xmath59 , and the extent of the disk , @xmath82 .",
    "the variation in the stellar and gas surface densities is largely contained in @xmath82 .",
    "the icm parameters are set by the choice of cluster , but clusters contain galaxies with a variety of orbits , morphologies , and inclinations . within the same cluster , a galaxy of mass @xmath240 with a low surface density on a radial orbit traveling face - on to the wind can be as severely stripped as a galaxy with @xmath241 that has a high surface density and is traveling edge - on . at the same time , the ram pressure can vary significantly between clusters with the same mass because of variations in the icm profile .",
    "two identical satellite galaxies on identical orbits in different clusters of the same mass can experience ram pressures that vary by a factor of @xmath242 .",
    "an effective mass , @xmath243 , can be defined for each individual galaxy .",
    "this is the mass of a satellite that the model predicts is stripped to the same @xmath85 as the given galaxy .",
    "the effect of the scatter in the parameters can then be discussed in terms of the scatter in @xmath243 at a given @xmath0 .",
    "the scatter in the @xmath93 at which a galaxy is stripped of @xmath109 , or in @xmath243 , can best be expressed as a multiplicative factor , @xmath244 .",
    "the source of scatter in @xmath243 can be grouped into three types , that due to the icm parameters , @xmath6 , @xmath11 , @xmath126 , the orbital parameters , @xmath91 , @xmath162 , @xmath8 , and the restoring pressure parameters , @xmath17 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 . the overall scatter in the high- and low - mass models , the result of",
    "varying all of the model parameters , are @xmath245 and @xmath246 .",
    "these can be broken down into @xmath247 , @xmath248 , @xmath249 , and @xmath250 .",
    "the discussion in the paragraph above is based on these estimates .",
    "the uses of this model are twofold .",
    "first , it makes general predictions about the degree of stripping that occurs to galaxies of different masses in a range of environments .",
    "second , it links the degree of stripping , @xmath109 or @xmath85 , to the ratio @xmath93 .",
    "this may be useful for verifying whether stripping is occurring within a galaxy catalog .",
    "the size of the scatter in @xmath243 determines the size of the galaxy catalog that is needed to see a dependence of @xmath109 on @xmath93 .",
    "the scatter in the @xmath11 profile parameters is a major contributor to the scatter in @xmath243 .",
    "therefore , such a catalog must either contain many clusters , or the icm profile of the clusters must be known . as an estimate of the catalog size necessary , if 200 satellite galaxies with approximately the same @xmath0 orbiting in 50 groups or clusters with the same @xmath1 are combined , then @xmath251 .",
    "if the range in @xmath0 and @xmath1 of such a catalog is large compared to this scatter , then the effects of stripping should be seen in the relationship between @xmath109 and @xmath93 .",
    "the model developed here relates the degree of ram pressure stripping a satellite galaxy experiences to the galaxy and cluster masses and can be used to quickly determine the extent to which a galaxy is likely to be stripped .",
    "all galaxies lose most of their hot galactic halo . in clusters galaxies at moderate mass ratios , @xmath252 ,",
    "are moderately stripped , @xmath253 , at intermediate distances , @xmath254 , from the cluster center and severely stripped closer to the cluster center .",
    "satellites with lower @xmath93 are severely stripped even at intermediate distances .",
    "stripping also occurs in groups .",
    "however , the same degree of stripping occurs for lower @xmath93 in groups than in clusters .",
    "dwarf galaxies are moderately to severely stripped at intermediate distances in groups , and large spiral galaxies can be moderately stripped if they travel to small @xmath66 .",
    "the model is simple and motivated by observations .",
    "dark matter profiles are well matched to nfw profiles outside a possible core , observations of x - ray gas in clusters can be fit using @xmath11 profiles , and the average gravitational potential of most galaxies should be well matched by the model potential .",
    "the model has a large number of parameters , but the values for many can be taken from observations .",
    "however , the model assumes that clusters are static . from an evolutionary standpoint",
    ", it is only valid after the group or cluster has acquired an icm .",
    "on the other hand , in dynamic clusters bulk icm motions may cause more stripping to occur than is predicted by the model .",
    "this is observed in the virgo cluster  @xcite .",
    "ram pressure stripping is not the only way to remove gas from galaxies . in groups and clusters tidal stripping of both gas and",
    "stars can occur ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . for dwarf galaxies",
    "it has been proposed that supernova winds associated with bursts of star formation may expel gas  @xcite , and the efficiency of this mechanism may depend on the environment  @xcite .",
    "however , ram pressure stripping is capable of removing gas from galaxies across a large range of galaxy masses and environments . in particular ram pressure stripping",
    "can act when supernova - driven ejection is likely to be inefficient and can remove gas from galaxies that are either not tidally interacting or that are experiencing only weak tidal interactions .",
    "the tidal radius , @xmath255 , at the physical orbital radius , @xmath256 , as estimated using @xmath257 , can be compared to the stripping radius , @xmath85 , as determined using the model . here",
    "@xmath258 is the cluster mass enclosed within @xmath256 . in scaled coordinates , @xmath259^{-1/3}$ ] , where @xmath260 .",
    "the h i fraction lost to tidal stripping depends only on the scaled size of the gas disk and @xmath66 and not on either mass .",
    "because the gas disk resides in the center of the satellite s dark halo , tidal stripping rarely effects the h i disk and practically never competes with the effect rps .",
    "for example , in order for the h i disk to be tidally stripped to @xmath261 , a satellite must travel to @xmath262 . by this @xmath66 the entire outer h",
    "i disk has been ram pressure stripped for almost all satellites .",
    "the effect of varying the model s parameters was studied both to identify the parameters that most effect the extent to which an individual galaxy is stripped and to determine the range of satellite and cluster masses that result in the same @xmath85 . the extent to which an individual galaxy is stripped depends most strongly on the galaxy s @xmath66 or @xmath59 , inclination , @xmath162 , and disk scale length , @xmath82 , and on the cluster s icm profile .",
    "galaxies that reach smaller @xmath66 , are face - on to the wind , have denser disks , or orbit through a denser icm are more effectively stripped .",
    "galaxies in the same cluster with @xmath0 that differ by as much as a factor of 25 can be stripped to the same @xmath85 . in different clusters , galaxies on identical orbits with identical morphologies , identical @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath17 ,",
    "can be stripped to the same @xmath85 with @xmath0 values that differ by as much as a factor of 30 .",
    "ram pressure stripping of satellite galaxies outer gas disks and hot galactic halos is occurring frequently in both groups and clusters . in general , removing gas from a galaxy reduces star formation .",
    "the gas in the outer disk and hot galactic halo is not currently involved in star formation , but may feed future star formation if it is not stripped . therefore , it would be interesting to study in more detail how the removal of this gas affects galaxy evolution and to determine if , to what extent , and how quickly star formation declines after a galaxy is stripped .",
