    "thanks to exchange interaction between magnetic ions and band carriers , diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) exhibit giant zeeman effect and related extraordinary magneto - optical properties@xcite . influence of magnetic ions can be further enhanced by introducing them to low dimensional semiconductor structures,@xcite which could be applied in the field of spintronics , @xcite solotronics @xcite and in the photophysics@xcite . from this point of view , particularly interesting are structures constructed of mn - doped wide - gap ii - vi semiconductors such as znse , zns or zno .",
    "this is because excitons in wide gap semiconductors exhibit high binding energy and high oscillator strength which open possibility of working at room temperature , and which result in high efficiency of photon sources and in strong coupling with photonic modes.@xcite however , the addition of mn@xmath0 ions to both bulk material and to the low dimensional structures results in that case in suppression of excitonic luminescence@xcite .",
    "this is due to the opening of a new , sensitive to magnetic field channels of nonradiative relaxation of excitons@xcite .",
    "therefore , of great interest were the results obtained on recently grown individual self - organized cdse / znse qds containing single mn@xmath0 ions indicating that in such structures a suppression of the luminescence does not occur effectively , while the specific magneto - optical properties of dms are preserved @xcite .",
    "explanation of the absence of luminescence quenching in a qd with a single magnetic ion may have a double importance . on the one hand to understand the physics which lies behind it , on the other",
    "it may indicate how to reduce luminescence quenching in structures with a higher content of mn@xmath0 , which from the point of view of their magneto - optical properties would be highly desirable .",
    "for this purpose in the present study we investigate the change in luminescence quenching when the number of mn@xmath0 ions in the individual cdse / znse qds is increased from one to several of them .",
    "the samples used in this study were grown using molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) technique .",
    "they contain self - assembled cdse qds between two znse layers ( barriers ) on gaas substrate . in some samples during the growth process ,",
    "the mn@xmath0 ions were introduced simultaneously with cdse layer . as the qds with a few magnetic ions were the subject of our studies , the concentration of dopants was a few times larger than concentration optimised for analogous qds with single magnetic ions@xciteand two magnetic ions@xcite , but smaller than for qds with many of them@xcite .",
    "the identification of the qds with various number of magnetic ions and further measurements were performed at temperature equal to 6  k in liquid helium cooled cryostat with superconducting magnet which produced magnetic field up to 10  t. photoluminescence ( pl ) measurements were performed with the use of continous wave ( cw ) lasers with wavelengths equal to 488  nm and 405  nm . for micro - photoluminescence ( @xmath1-pl )",
    "measurements the sample was attached directly to immersion reflection microscope . in this configuration",
    "the size of laser spot on the sample was below 1  @xmath2 m .",
    "the luminescence from the sample was spectrally resolved by a monochromator equipped with a ccd camera . for time - resolved measurements",
    "a 425  nm pulsed laser and a streak camera were used .",
    "in order to verify the presence of the pl quenching in our mn - doped sample we performed macro - pl measurements of qds ensemble also in the reference sample without mn dopants .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ mocbuly ] , in the case of mn - doped sample a significant rise of the pl intensity in @xmath3 circular polarization of detection is observed .",
    "the effect is less pronounced for high excitation power .",
    "such behavior is a well - known fingerprint of magnetic ions - related pl quenching @xcite due to non - radiantive exciton recombination channel corresponding to excitation of the mn ions .",
    "the total spin s of the ion is equal to  @xmath4 for excited @xmath5 and @xmath6 states and @xmath7 for @xmath8 ground state .",
    "the selection rules for the spin projection forbid excitation from ground states with @xmath9 . thus , spin orientation in high magnetic fields leads to suppression of the pl qunching . in similar experiment such phenomena is not observed in the case of the sample without mn@xmath0 ions . the only observed pl intensity change is a slight polarization of the whole spectrum due to excitonic spin relaxation@xcite .",

    "significant rise of the pl intensity with magnetic field is observed , which is typical for magnetic ion - related pl quenching .",
    "please note , that the scales on vertical axes are different.,width=321 ]    to confirm the nature of the observed phenomena in the mn - doped sample , the measurements of the luminescence lifetime were performed .",
    "one could expect the lifetime to rise significantly with magnetic field as the pl quenching recombination channel is turned off , but this is not the case in our sample .",
    "average lifetime is equal to about 100  ps and does not depend significantly on the value of the magnetic field ( see fig .",
    "[ czaszyciabuly ] ) .",
    "this fact indicates that the observed pl quenching is not related to the non - radiative recombination channels of the relaxed exciton states ( the pl is related to ) , but must occur before the relaxation of photocreated carriers ( presumably in the barriers ) .",

    "in order to investigate in detail the origin of the observed pl quenching we performed micro - pl measurements of single qds . due to small laser spot on the sample it was possible to separate well - resolved pl lines originating from single qds in the low energy tail of the qd ensemble spectrum .",

    "the typical width of those features is about 1.2 mev , while the width of the splitting is typically equal to about 0.4 mev . since",
    "such features are not observed in the case of similar samples with no magnetic impurities , we tentatively relate them to qds containing a few mn@xmath0 ions . inferring from the width of the features ,",
    "the mn@xmath0 ions are positioned in such a way that the exciton - mn exchange interaction has modest strength when compared to the case of previously investigated cdse qds with single mn@xmath0 ions @xcite . in order to support this hypothesis",

    "[ symulacje0 t ] , together with experimentally obtained spectra of qds containing one and  presumably  a few magnetic impurities . even though we are not able to resolve the multitude of excitonic lines in the case of a few mn@xmath0 ions , it is still possible to analyze general shape of resultant broad feature in the spectrum .",
    "for example the splitting always visible in the middle of the feature is related to the anisotropic part of electron - hole exchange interaction ( @xmath15 ) .",

    "the existence of the quenching of the excitons confined inside qd was verified with the use of two different methods . the first one is based on measuring total intensity of pl lines originating from recombination of excitons confined in the qd for various values of magnetic field applied in the faraday configuration .",
    "the sample was illuminated with a 488  nm cw laser and the intensity of pl lines was determined after subtracting the broad background from the pl spectra .",
    "if the effective pl quenching was present in the observed qds , the pl intensity should significantly increase in magnetic field due to blockade of non - radiative recombination channels @xcite .",
    "in our case we observed no significant variation of the photoluminescence intensity for all magnetic fields up to 10  t and both circular polarizations of detection ( see fig .",
    "[ mockropki ] ) .",
    "such variation was , however , observed for the broad background ( see fig .",

    "if such exist  should shorten the lifetime of the excitons confined in the qd .",
    "the presence of the pl quenching can be verified either by analysing dependence of luminescence lifetime as a function of magnetic field or by direct comparison of the lifetime of the exciton in a qd without mn@xmath0 ions and in a qd with a few mn@xmath0 ions .",
    "we have measured lifetimes of exciton ( x ) and biexciton ( xx ) luminescence peaks as a function of magnetic field .",
    "neither of these two peaks show significant dependence on the field . for exemplary qd with a few mn@xmath0 ions the x lifetime is equal to 250  ps @xmath27 15  ps , while the xx lifetime is 120  ps @xmath27 7  ps for all magnetic fields up to 10  t. also , the lifetimes of excitonic complexes pl peaks for all investigated qds lie in the range expected for qds without magnetic dopants @xcite .    similarly , in the case of the broad background no significant effect of the magnetic field on the pl decay was observed .",
    "the decay can be described with good accuracy with two - exponential curve ( see fig .",
    "[ mikrotlo_dwuzanik ] ) .",
    "the characteristic times were equal to 230  ps @xmath27 30  ps for the longer component and about 30  ps @xmath27 5  ps for the shorter component .",

    "however , it significantly affects the broad pl feature related to the wetting layer .",
    "the fact that the lifetime of this feature is not affected by the magnetic field suggests that the non - radiative recombination channels affect mostly higher ( excited ) excitonic states and not the relaxed states the luminescence come from .",

    "however , such quenching is observed for the pl related to the wetting layer . at the same time",
    "it does not affect significantly the lifetime of the luminescence .",
