    "entangled photon pairs have been discussed in relation with the einstein - padolsky - rosen ( epr ) paradox,@xcite and nowadays they play an important role in quantum information technologies .",
    "the pursuit of their high - quality and high - efficiency generation is a fascinating subject in the fields of quantum optics and solid - state physics .",
    "in addition to the standard generation method by parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) in second - order nonlinear crystals @xcite the generation scheme using a semiconductor quantum dot @xcite attracts much attention , because purely a single pair of entangled photons is created in principle , and it can be a deterministic source of entangled pairs .",
    "recently , the generation efficiency is highly enhanced by implementing an optical cavity structure with distributed bragg reflectors ( dbrs ) @xcite and by a molecule of micropillars.@xcite further , the emission by electric injection has been reported .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the development of entangled photons as an excitation light source is of growing importance for the next - generation technologies of fabrication and chemical reaction.@xcite for this purpose , high - power and high - quality entangled - photon beams are absolutely necessary , and this high - power but probabilistic generation is another direction of research in addition to the deterministic generation by single quantum dots .    .",
    "due to the conservation of energy and wavevector , the positions of the two peaks depend on scattering angle,@xcite and the entangled two photons are emitted symmetrical about the pump beam as shown in the inset .",
    "two additional peaks called @xmath0 and @xmath1 in scattering spectra originate from the biexciton decay into transverse and longitudinal exciton levels , respectively . ]    in the process of pdc,@xcite an incident photon with frequency @xmath2 and wavenumber @xmath3 splits into two photons @xmath4 and @xmath5 with satisfying the conservation of energy @xmath6 and of wavevector @xmath7 .",
    "this second - order nonlinear process creates polarization - correlated entangled - photon pairs in nonlinear optical crystals with a birefringence . on the other hand ,",
    "savasta et al.@xcite suggested and edamatsu et al.@xcite experimentally demonstrated that ultraviolet entangled - photon pairs are generated by the biexciton - resonant hyperparametric scattering ( rhps ) in cucl ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the rhps is a third - order nonlinear process , in which two incident photons resonantly creates a biexciton ( excitonic molecule ) with @xmath8 and it spontaneously collapses into a photon pair satisfying @xmath9 and @xmath10 . since the lowest level of biexcitons in cucl , which was resonantly excited in the experiment , has zero angular momentum,@xcite the emitted pair consists of left- and right - circularly polarized photons conserving the total angular momentum .",
    "owing to the two possible decay paths involving exciton - polaritons , the emitted photons are polarization - entangled .",
    "the generation efficiency of rhps is much higher than that of pdc , because of the giant oscillator strength of the two - photon absorption involving the biexciton.@xcite however , in the first experiment,@xcite a part of observed pairs has no entanglement , and this noise was subtracted in the estimation of entanglement of the generated pairs . as indicated by oohata et al.,@xcite the main contribution of the unentangled pairs is an accidental collapse of two biexcitons , and this problem has been successfully suppressed by using high - repetition and weak - power laser pulses , because the number of unentangled pairs ( noise ) is increased by @xmath11 for increasing the pumping power @xmath12 while the number of entangled pairs ( signal ) is proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "however , this fundamental trade - off problem between signal intensity and @xmath14 ratio should be resolved from the improvement of material structures @xcite in addition to the improvement of pumping condition of ref .  . while one solution is using a single quantum dot as a deterministic source , @xcite for the pursuit of high - power generation",
    "there is a proposal of using an optical cavity embedding an excitonic quantum well for the improvement of generation efficiency.@xcite furthermore , owing to the rapid radiative decay by the exciton superradiance ( enhancement of interaction volume between excitons and photons ) , @xcite we have theoretically revealed that the trade - off problem can be resolved simultaneously realizing a high generation efficiency by using an optical cavity embedding an excitonic layer in nano - to - bulk crossover regime .",
    "@xcite    in a microcrystal , such as quantum dot and quantum well , smaller than the bohr radius of excitons , the electron and hole are individually confined in the crystal , and the relative motion of excitons and also the binding energy are strongly modified from those in bulk crystal .",
    "when the crystal size is larger than the exciton bohr radius but small enough compared to the light wavelength , the center - of - mass motion of excitons are confined , and the center - of - mass kinetic energy is quantized .",
    "@xcite when the crystal size is comparable or a few times larger than the wavelength ( nano - to - bulk crossover regime ) , the system is characterized by exciton - photon coupled modes with peculiar resonance energy and radiative life time , and the coupled modes are gradually reduced to bulk polaritons with increasing the crystal size .",
    "@xcite in this crossover regime , the system shows a variety of optical responses compared to bulk materials and also to quantum dots due to the center - of - mass confinement of excitons and the spatially resonant coupling with electromagnetic fields . actually , owing to the recent development of nano - scale fabrication , anomalous nonlinear optical processes",
    "have been reported in semiconductor nano - structures and in the nano - to - bulk crossover regime .",
    "@xcite further , it shows a rapid radiative decay rate of excitons on the order of 100fs due to the exciton superradiance.@xcite concerning the entangled photon generation , while the performance of pdc method is almost governed by the choice of nonlinear materials and its thickness , the rhps method significantly depends on the quantum states of excitons and biexcitons , because it is a resonant process involving the elementary excitations . in the nano - to - bulk crossover regime",
    ", the generation of entangled photon pairs by rhps can be significantly modified with respect to frequencies , angles , polarizations , and phase difference of the generated entangled state as discussed in our previous letter.@xcite in the present long paper , we will show the detailed theoretical framework for the investigation of the entangled - photon generation in nano - to - bulk crossover regime with multilayer structures , especially an excitonic layer embedded in dbrs .",

    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "the emission spectra from bose - einstein condensation of biexcitons were calculated by inoue and hanamura,@xcite and they also showed the relation between energies and scattering angles of two peaks called lep and hep ( lower and higher energy polaritons ) .",
    "later , hanamura and takagahara@xcite calculated line shapes of the so - called and peaks , which are emitted by the relaxations of biexcitons to transverse and longitudinal excitons , respectively .",
    "the entanglement of the scattered photons by rhps was first pointed out by savasta et al.,@xcite and their theoretical framework@xcite is based on the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) theory for dispersive and absorbing media @xcite and on the exciton - exciton correlation functions calculated from first principles .",
    "@xcite    in the present paper , in order to correctly treat the center - of - mass confinement of excitons , we start from the qed theory of excitons,@xcite which simultaneously solves the equation of motion of excitons and of electromagnetic fields with inheriting the concepts of the above qed theories @xcite and of the semiclassical nonlocal theory@xcite ( or the so - called abc - free theory@xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that the center - of - mass motion of excitons raises more than one propagating modes of exciton - polaritons in their band gap frequency , and the rhps process has been used to observe the dispersion of polaritons @xcite and also to measure the translational masses of excitons and biexcitons .",
    "@xcite moreover , optical responses explicitly reflects the confinement of center - of - mass motion of excitons in nano - structured materials and also in the nano - to - bulk crossover regime , @xcite which we investigate in the present paper .    concerning the treatment of biexcitons , we suppose the excitons as pure bosons and consider an exciton - exciton interaction leading to the creation of biexcitons",
    ". however , instead of the detailed treatment in the theory of savasta et al.,@xcite we simply assume the relative motion of the lowest level of biexcitons with some parameters measured in experiments,@xcite and the coefficients of the exciton - exciton interaction is replaced by the wavefunction and the binding energy of biexcitons .",
    "this treatment is very simple and useful to catch the behavior of biexciton lowest level in cucl even in the nano - to - bulk crossover regime , because the exciton and biexciton states in cucl has been well analyzed by the bipolariton theory@xcite and rhps experiments.@xcite while the treatment of biexcitons is in general a four - body problem with two electrons and two holes and it is usually a hard work , owing to the above mentioned simple treatment , we can easily discuss the polarization correlation of photon pairs emitted from the biexciton lowest level , which has no angular momentum .",
    "moreover , by the use of the dyadic green s function for the wave equation of electric field , we can consider the surroundings of excitonic material , such as an optical cavity consisting of two dbrs . in order to extract the scattering fields , instead of using the input - output relation ,",
    "@xcite we consider the definition of green s function and commutation relations of fluctuation operators .",
    "this simple treatment is valid at least in multilayer systems and useful to consider complicated structures .    in the following subsections ,",

    "although a good performance is obtained at a thickness of hundreds nanometers , the generation efficiency of such thin films is much lower than that of bulk crystals as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:8](a ) , and a strong pump power is required to achieve a sufficient signal intensity at such thickness range . while the superradiant excitons maintain the large nonlinearity ( excitonic component),@xcite this low efficiency simply comes from the small thickness ( interaction volume ) .",
    "this problem can be overcome by using an optical cavity in the strong - coupling regime , because we can control both the interaction volume and radiative decay rate using two parameters : quality factor ( q - factor ) of cavity and thickness of cucl .",
    "this aspect is different from the simple semiconductor microcavity , in which the interaction volume and radiative decay rate are respectively enhanced in strong- and weak - coupling regimes .",
    "although a high generation efficiency can be achieved by using a high - q cavity , we have to simultaneously realize a rapid radiative decay of entangled photons inside the cavity .",
    "therefore , we consider a low - q cavity as reported in ref .  , namely , a cucl layer in a dbr cavity composed of @xmath134 and @xmath133 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) . here , since the translational invariance is broken at the thickness of nanometers , the generated photons can go forward and also backward in contrast to the bulk case .",
    "therefore , we suppose a high reflectance on the transmission side to suppress the leakage of entangled photons , and we focus on the backward emission .",
    "the dbr cavity is considered by the background dielectric function @xmath45 in eq .  .",
    "the refractive indexes of @xmath134 and @xmath133 are 1.86 and 2.95 , respectively .",
    "the gray lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] represent the backward emission from the cavity structure , where the cavity mode frequency is tuned to @xmath248 , @xmath304 , and the periods of the incident and transmitted sides are 4 and 16 , respectively ( q - factor is 50 ) .",
    "this system corresponds to the weak bipolariton regime@xcite ( but the strong - coupling regime of excitons and photons ) , where the energy splitting between polariton and biexciton levels is small compared with their broadening .",
    "this situation is in contrast to that in refs .   and , where the strong enhancement of entangled - photon generation from a quantum well in a high - q cavity has been discussed on the basis of the biexcitonic cavity - qed picture or the strong bipolariton picture .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:9](a ) , since biexcitons are effectively created , the generation efficiency is significantly enhanced at a thickness of nanometers , and it is larger than the maximum value in the case of bare cucl film existing in vacuum ( black line ) .",
    "the enhancement also occurs when the polariton energy ( exciton - photon coupled mode ) is equal to half the biexciton energy , which is consistent with the results in refs .   and .",
    "compared with fig  [ fig:8](a ) , the period of the oscillation is doubled , because the rhps involving biexcitons with odd - parity center - of - mass motion is forbidden in the one - sided optical cavity . on the other hand , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:9](b ) , at a thickness of micrometers , the performance is suppressed compared with that of the bare cucl film . this is because of the multiple reflections inside the cavity , and the scattered fields non - radiatively decay during the propagation .",
    "in contrast , at the thickness of nanometers , particularly at 80 nm , the performance almost maintains the ideal quantity .",
    "this is due to the enhancement of the radiative decay rate by exciton superradiance , and the enhancement of generation efficiency is simultaneously obtained by the cavity effect in the strong - coupling regime .    .",
    "a cucl film with thickness @xmath305 is embedded in the dbr cavity considered in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] , and the other parameters are also the same .",
    "( b ) the spectrum of the corresponding performance @xmath284 .",
    "( c ) the exciton - photon coupled modes in the film are plotted in the same manner as in fig .",
    "[ fig:5](b ) . ]    finally , in figs .",
    "[ fig:10](a ) and ( b ) , we show the spectra of generation efficiency and performance , respectively , in the case of cucl film with thickness @xmath306 embedded in the dbr cavity discussed above .",
    "this thickness is chosen to achieve a high generation efficiency , while the performance at @xmath286 is 0.86 , which is smaller than the maximum value in fig .",
    "[ fig:9](b ) .",
    "however , compared to the thin film without the cavity , the generation efficiency is significantly increased and the high performance is successfully maintained due to the rapid radiative decay .",
    "further , while the pump frequency @xmath2 is assumed to the two - photon absorption frequency in bulk cucl in figs .",
    "[ fig:10](a ) and ( b ) , we have numerically checked that , when @xmath2 is correctly tuned to the eigen frequency of a confined biexciton mode , the generation efficiency is enhanced more dramatically with maintaining the high performance in the case with dbr cavity .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:10](c ) , the exciton - photon coupled modes are plotted with horizontal bars , and we can find that one mode with high radiative decay rate exists close to the pump frequency @xmath2 ( two - photon absorption frequency of biexcitons ) .",
    "this mode corresponds to the lower cavity polariton , and the strong electric field in the cavity enhances the generation efficiency of biexcitons due to the cavity - induced double resonance .",
    "@xcite furthermore , the generated entangled excitons rapidly decay into photons through this polariton mode , which ensures the high performance at the same time .",
    "in this way , by using an optical cavity embedding a cucl layer with a thickness of nanometers , we can obtain high efficiency and performance simultaneously . to avoid the leakage of generated photons ,",
    "the reflectance on the transmission side should be high enough , but that on the incident side should not be high to obtain a rapid radiative decay rate . once we choose a cavity structure , we can numerically determine the optimal thickness of cucl layer , in which an exciton - photon coupled mode has half the biexciton frequency , a rapid radiative decay rate , and also large exciton component ( large nonlinearity ) to achieve high performance and generation efficiency .",
    "such a coupled mode is an unique feature in the nano - to - bulk crossover regime .",
    "we have developed a theoretical framework for the investigation of the biexciton - involved rhps based on the qed theory for excitons.@xcite compared to the previous theories,@xcite our method can be applied to nano - to - bulk crossover regime because we explicitly consider the center - of - mass motion of exciton .",
    "further , we can discuss the polarization correlation of entangled pairs and the surroundings of the excitonic layer , such as the dbr cavity structure . while we considered cucl films in actual calculation , by treating several relative exciton levels and by correctly calculating the center - of - mass wavefunctions of excitons confined in finite crystal including the effect of dead layer,@xcite our theoretical framework can be applied to other materials in principle .",
    "further , by correctly treat the modification of relative motion of excitons and biexcitons strongly confined in nano crystals and also the pauli s exclusion principle , our framework can be extended for the investigation of single quantum dot , the deterministic generation of entangled photons .",
    "we have calculated the scattering spectra of rhps from cucl films with bulk - like and submicron thicknesses . for the bulk - like thickness , the four peaks called @xmath0 , @xmath1 , lep and hep are reproduced . on the other hand ,",
    "the scattering spectra of the thin film are significantly modified from the bulk ones , and we found that they reflect the exciton - photon coupled modes in the thin film .",
    "@xcite therefore , the rhps measurement is also useful to observe the exciton - photon coupled modes in nano - structured materials @xcite as well as the four - wave mixing@xcite and the two - photon excitation scattering.@xcite we also found that semiconductor thin films have much degrees of freedom to control generated states of entangled photon pairs .",
    "in addition to the signal intensity of entangled - photon generation , we also discuss the performance of the material structure by considering the noise intensity from independent two biexcitons .",
    "although the thickness dependence of signal intensity has a maximum value at particular thickness determined by nonradiative decay rate of excitons , @xcite a high performance is generally obtained at thickness of nanometers due to the rapid radiative decay of excitons . however",
    ", the generation efficiency of such thin films is much weaker compared to the bulk one .",
    "we have demonstrated that , by using a dbr cavity embedding an excitonic layer in the nano - to - bulk crossover regime , the generation efficiency can be enhanced while maintaining the high performance .    for the pursuit of high - power and high - quality but probabilistic generation of entangled photons , which is essential for the next - generation technologies of fabrication and chemical reaction,@xcite",
    "the biexciton - involved rhps shows a quite high generation efficiency compared to that of pdc method . from the viewpoint of the quality of generated",
    "entangled pairs , the rhps method can show a high performance and a high generation efficiency simultaneously by using and an optical cavity embedding a cucl nano - layer .",
    "further , it has much degrees of freedom to control the generated states of entangled photons .",
    "we believe that our results make a breakthrough in high - power and high - quality entangled - photon generation .",
