    "correlations between quantum systems can not always be explained by local causal theory  @xcite .",
    "this nature of quantum correlations helps to perform certain information processing tasks , for example , quantum teleportation  @xcite , super dense coding  @xcite and quantum key distribution  @xcite , which are not possible using classical correlations .",
    "however , in practice , quantum systems are continuously interacting with the environment , and this interaction weakens the correlations between observed quantum systems .",
    "hence , the most crucial task in quantum information processing is to protect quantum correlations from diminishing due to the effect of the ubiquituous environment .",
    "under special circumstances , interaction between systems and a common environment can generate entanglement  @xcite .",
    "for example , when two or more atoms are consecutively passing through a cavity , they become entangled  @xcite .",
    "although , for a specific information processing task , _ viz . _ quantum teleportation , the environmental interaction modeled by an amplitude damping channel ( adc ) can enhance the fidelity of quantum teleportation of those bipartite states whose teleportation fidelity lies just below the quantum region  @xcite , this improvement of fidelity is found to be possible only for a certain class of bipartite states  @xcite .    moreover",
    ", one can use the technique of weak measurements to protect the fidelity of quantum teleportation when systems are interacting with the environment modeled by an amplitude damping channel  @xcite .",
    "the idea of weak measurements was originally proposed  @xcite on the basis of weak coupling between the observed system and the measurement device , thereby making possible for the measurement outcomes to be amplified compared to the eigenvalue spectrum of original system , for suitable post - selected ensembles .",
    "this technique has been implemented in many different ways , such as in the study of the spin hall effect  @xcite , superluminal propagation of light  @xcite , wave particle duality using cavity - qed experiments  @xcite , direct measurement of the quantum wave function  @xcite , measurement of ultrasmall time delays of light  @xcite , and observing bohmian trajectories of photons  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we study the possibility of preservation of the quantum key rate for a bipartite state shared between alice and bob where alice s system is not trusted as a quantum system .",
    "more specifically , we discuss a way to protect the one - sided device independent quantum key distribution ( 1s - diqkd ) protocol  @xcite when the system interacts with the environment modeled by adc . comparing the preservation of 1s - diqkd with the preservation of the fidelity of quantum teleportation",
    ", we observe that adc can not improve the optimal secret key rate in 1s - diqkd , which is derived using the steering inequality  @xcite based on the fine - grained uncertainty relation  @xcite , though it can improve the teleportation fidelity for states having teleportation fidelity just below the quantum region  @xcite .",
    "we show that improvement of the key rate becomes possible using the technique of weak measurement and its reversal , which may be used to suppress the effect of the amplitude damping decoherence  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly recapitulate the technique of weak measurement and its reversal in the presence of an interaction of the system with the environment as modeled by adc . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the connection of steerability with quantum key distribution for the case of the 1s - diqkd protocol  @xcite . in sec .",
    "iv we demonstrate the effect of the amplitude damping decoherence on the steerability and key rate . in sec .",
    "v we show how the technique of weak measurement and its reversal can be used to protect the key rate . finally , in sec . vi we summarize the main results of this work .",
    "let us consider that a qubit is prepared either in the state @xmath0 or in the state @xmath1 .",
    "the qubit is allowed to interact with the environment by adc , where the environment is initially in the state @xmath2 .",
    "due to the effect of decoherence , the combined state of the system and environment becomes @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the strength of the system with environment and @xmath5 . in practice ,",
    "the photon loss when the photon is passing through the environment can be regarded as amplitude damping decoherence . the above interaction  ( [ adc_int ] )",
    "can be written as a positive and trace preserving map @xmath6 given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "it has been shown in earlier works  @xcite that the technique of weak measurement and its reverse can suppress the environmental effect modeled by adc . here , before allowing interaction with the environment ,",
    "the system is measured using a scheme of weak quantum measurement , with strength @xmath10 .",
    "more specifically , the detector detects the system with probability @xmath10 if and only if the system is in the state @xmath1 .",
    "when the detector detects , the correponding kraus operator is given by @xmath11 which does not have any inverse .",
    "hence , this operation , i.e. , the detection is irreversible .",
    "the operator when the system is not detected is given by @xmath12 the operator @xmath13 is reversible , i.e. , the application of its inverse restores the system to its initial state . the case where the system is detected will be discarded .",
    "hence , weak measurement is associated with a success probability .    after performing weak measurement , the system is allowed to interact with the environment and at the end , to reduce the affect of environment , reverse weak measurement is performed .",
    "the operator corresponding the case when the system is not detected is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the strength of the reverse weak measurement .",
    "non - local quantum correlations between two systems , say @xmath16 and @xmath17 , can be categorized separately by entanglement , steering and bell non - local correlation  @xcite , respectively . in the case of entanglement , both @xmath16 and @xmath17 are trusted as quantum systems , whereas , none of them is trusted as a quantum system in bell non - local correlation . in the intermediate case of steering ,",
    "one of them is trusted as a quantum system and the shared state , @xmath18 is said to be entangled if it can not be described by a local hidden state model ( lhs )  @xcite .",
    "there are different steering criteria based on different uncertainty relations  @xcite . in the present work we use the optimal fine - grained steering criteria to study the quantum key rate of steerable states  @xcite .    to discuss fine - grained steering , let us consider the following game .",

    "bob only trusts that the system @xmath17 is quantum , but agrees that the prepared state is entangled if and only if alice has control on the state of systems @xmath17 .",
    "in other words , @xmath18 is said to be steerable when it can not be explained a by local hidden state model  @xcite . to check whether the state is steerable",
    ", bob asks alice to control the state of his system @xmath17 in one of the eigenstates of the observable chosen randomly from the set @xmath19 .",
    "next , alice measures a suitable observable chosen from the set @xmath20 and communicates her choice and outcome .",
    "the shared state @xmath18 is steerable when the conditional probability distribution @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are measurement outcomes at bob s and alice s side ) violates the relation  @xcite @xmath24 \\leq \\frac{3}{4 } .",

    "@xcite , it has been further shown that if the shared state @xmath18 between systems @xmath16 and @xmath17 is maximally steerable , then none of these systems can be quantumly correlated , or steerable with any other system  this phenomena is called monogamy of steerable states .",
    "this nature of steerable states lower bounds the secret key rate in a one - sided device independent way , i.e. , one of the systems is not trusted .",

    "the interaction between the system and the environment is not considered . in this section",

    "the technique of weak measurement is associated with a success probability , as it is implemented with post - selection discarding the state when it is detected .",
    "we further show here , that considering even the unsuccessful attempts ( when the systems are discarded ) , the average key rate turns out to be greater than the case where the weak measurement technique is not applied , for a considerable range of the interaction parameters .",
