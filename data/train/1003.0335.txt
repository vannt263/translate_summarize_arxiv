    "computing solutions to the navier - stokes equations at realistic values of the reynolds number ( @xmath9 , with characteristic velocity , @xmath10 , and length - scale , @xmath11 and viscosity , @xmath12 ) for most geophysical , astrophysical , and many engineering applications is technologically infeasible .",
    "this is because the range of dynamically important length ( and time ) scales is quite large : from the large scale , @xmath11 , defined by the problem down to the scales of viscous dissipation , @xmath13 .",
    "one approach is to simply cut off the smallest scales to arrive at a problem small enough for modern computational limits . a low - bandpass filter , @xmath14 , replaces the velocity , @xmath15 , and pressure , @xmath16 , with smoother , resolvable fields , @xmath17 .",

    "thus , the models may be more applicable to intermittent phenomena where the length of the inertial range can be important @xcite . since the models do not introduce the effect of the small scales in an _ ad hoc _ fashion but rather preserve the mathematical properties of the underlying equations ,",
    "their application can further our understanding of turbulence and turbulence modeling .",
    "the methods are also more easily generalized to other problems ( e.g. , coupling to a magnetic field ) .    in this paper",
    "we address two separate questions .",
    "one is the question of the practical applicability of regularization models as sfs models .",
    "when addressing this question , the filter width , @xmath23 , will be placed in the inertial range and the grid spacing , @xmath24 , will be just small enough to achieve a dns of the regularization .",
    "our aim is then to determine how well the model s dns reproduces a `` dns '' of navier - stokes compared _ at scales larger than @xmath23 . _",
    "our second question is `` how do the models work ? ''",
    "the first model we consider is the lagrangian - averaged navier - stokes ( lans ) @xmath0model @xcite .",
    "it is derived by lagrangian averaging fluid motions followed by application of taylor s frozen - in turbulence approximation as the model s one and only closure : fluctuations about the lagrangian mean smaller than @xmath23 are swept along by the large - scale flow and are not allowed to interact with one another the model is attractive as it retains the hamiltonian structure of navier - stokes , preserves kelvin s theorem ( conserves small - scale circulation in the absence of dissipation ) , and conserves both total energy and helicity ( the correlation between the velocity , @xmath15 , and its curl , the vorticity @xmath19 ) these properties are conserved in the @xmath25 norm instead of the usual @xmath3 norm .",
    "this is essential when interpreting results of the model as , for example , quantities involving the square velocity , @xmath26 , must now be replaced with the dot product @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the filtered velocity .",
    "physically , the model retains nonlocal interactions ( important at finite @xmath22 @xcite ) between the superfilter and subfilter scales while the flux of energy in subfilter scales is reduced by the limit on local small - scale to small - scale interactions    the lans@xmath1 model is given by , @xmath29 from the identity , @xmath30 , we see that it differs from navier - stokes both in advection by the smoothed velocity and the addition of a second nonlinear term associated with the conservation of circulation .",

    "consequently , dissipation goes as @xmath38 instead of @xmath39 and the same amount of power is dissipated in fewer scales .",
