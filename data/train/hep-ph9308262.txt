    "heavy quark effective field theory @xcite has turned out to be a useful tool for the description of heavy quark systems .",
    "due to additional symmetries @xcite emerging in the heavy quark limit several predictions for the decays of heavy hadrons may be obtained which are completely model independent . in particular",
    ", the form factors of weak decays involving a heavy to heavy transition are severely constrained by heavy quark symmetry and some predictions may be obtained even for heavy to light deacays @xcite .",
    "the heavy quark expansion has also been applied to inclusive decays .",
    "the first discussion of inclusive semileptonic decays in this framework has been given by chay , georgi and grinstein in @xcite .",
    "along similar lines proceeds the work of bigi , shifman , uraltsev and vainstein @xcite and of blok , koyrakh , shifman and vainshtein @xcite , where inclusive nonleptonic as well as semileptonic decays have been considered .",
    "usually the inclusive decay rates of heavy hadrons and their spectra are approximated by the decay of the heavy quarks in a parton model approximation .",
    "however , this is a model approach and an estimate of its error is difficult .",
    "this in is contrast to the methods described in @xcite and also to the present approch which is a controllable approximation to qcd corresponding to expansions in small parameters .",
    "the method proposed in @xcite to deal with inclusive processes is to use an operator product expansion , which is justified for heavy hadrons due to its large mass .",
    "the lowest dimension operator is a dimension three operator ; its matrix elements are normalized due to heavy quark symmetries and yield the parton model result .",
    "corrections enter through operators of dimension five ; their matrix elements are parameters to be taken from measurements .",
    "these corrections have been calculated for nonleptonic and for semileptonic decays of mesons in @xcite and for the differential distributions in semileptonic decays in @xcite ; semileptonic decays of baryons have been considered in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we shall consider only semileptonic decays and formulate a slightly different approach as the one proposed in @xcite .",
    "after switching to heavy quark effective theory the space time dependence of the heavy quark fields in the hadronic tensor is only due to the residual momentum @xmath0 of the heavy quark @xmath1 inside the heavy hadron @xmath2 , i.e.  @xmath3 . in semileptonic",
    "decays there is in addition to the scale set by the heavy mass @xmath4 also the momentum transfer to the leptons @xmath5 . after switching to the effective theory",
    "the relevant variable becomes @xmath6 , which defines in addition to the mass @xmath4 of the heavy quark a second scale in the problem .",
    "in large portions of the phase space @xmath7 is of the order of @xmath8 and thus a simultaneous expansion in both @xmath9 and @xmath10 is appropriate .",
    "this is the approach chosen in @xcite .",
    "however , one may also consider the region in phase space , where @xmath11 and thus an expansion only in powers of @xmath10 is necessary while only the leading term of the @xmath9 is kept .    in the present paper we shall consider the latter approach and compare to the one of @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we fix our notation by giving the basic formulae for the inclusive decay rates . in section 3",
    "we set up the operator product expansion in the effective theory and discuss the lowest order term and the first nonvanishing correction . the setup given here",
    "may be used for baryonic as well as for mesonic decays and in section 4 we give a parametrization for the hadronic matrix elements for meson- and baryon inclusive decays and discuss short distance qcd corrections .",
    "finally , in section 5 we discuss the lepton energy spectrum in inclusive semileptonic decays in some detail .",
    "in order to set up the notation we shall briefly recall the basic formulae for the description of inclusive semileptonic decays .",
    "the inclusive semileptonic decay of a heavy hadron @xmath2 ( either a heavy meson or a heavy baryon ) into some hadronic state @xmath12 and two leptons @xmath13 is mediated by an effective hamiltonian of the form @xmath14 where @xmath1 is the heavy quark contained in the in the heavy hadron @xmath2 may be determined from the hadronic state @xmath12 . ] .",
    "the differential decay rate may be written in terms of the hadronic tensor @xmath15 @xmath16 we shall consider only the case where the spins of the final state leptons are not measured ; hence the leptonic tensor is given by @xmath17 the differential decay rate in the rest frame of the heavy hadron is then @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the phase space integral @xmath20 the delta function @xmath21(observables ) projects out the observables to be considered ; for the case of the energy spectrum of the charged lepton in the rest frame of the decaying heavy meson it is @xmath22 , since @xmath23 is the momentum of the charged lepton .",
    "furthermore , @xmath24 is the lepton mass which we shall neglect in the following .",
    "the hadronic tensor may be rewritten using standard techniques @xmath25 where we have explicitly spelled out the @xmath26 dependence of the field operators .",
    "the tensor @xmath27 may be decomposed into scalar form factors which then depend only on two invariants ; these may be cenveniently chosen to be @xmath5 and @xmath28 .",
    "as discussed in some detail in @xcite , one may relate these form factors to the disconitinuity of the ones defining the time ordered product @xmath29 | h(v ) > \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a fixed value of @xmath5 there are two cuts of ( [ tprod ] ) in the complex @xmath28 plane .",
    "a physical cut extents along the real axis for @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mass of the lightest hadronic final state .",
    "in addition , there is a cut extenting along the real axis for @xmath32 the problematic region in phase space is the one where the invariant mass of the hadronic final state approaches @xmath31 ; here resonances will dominate and perturbative qcd will receive large corrections .",
    "however , even in this region the predictions of perturbative qcd will be recovered by a suitable smearing , i.e.  by calculating a smooth average along some portion of the cut .",
    "this has been discussed in some detail for the case of @xmath33 hadrons in @xcite and applied to the present case in @xcite . in particular",
    ", one may expect a suitable smearing , if the energy spectrum of the charged lepton is calculated .    in order to calculate such",
    "an average one has to perform a contour integration of @xmath34 in the complex @xmath28 plane with a suitable weight function .",
    "the contour encircles the physical cut in such a way that the discontinuity @xmath34 ( i.e.  the weighted hadronic tensor @xmath27 ) of the cut is picked up .",
    "as has been argued in @xcite one may deform the integration contours in the complex @xmath28 plane in such a way that one always stays away from the dangerous region by a distance large compared to @xmath35 .",
    "this may be achived provided that @xmath36 because for @xmath37 the cut ( [ pcut ] ) and ( [ upcut ] ) pinch the integration contour for @xmath38 . from these arguments",
    "one expects that perturbative qcd may be applied after suitable smearing and for @xmath36 which means that we may only study inclusive semileptonic @xmath39 transitions in perturbation theory , while @xmath40 transitions are likely to receive large , nonperturbative corrections , at least in the region , where @xmath5 is close to its maximal value .",
    "keeping this in mind one may relate the perturbatively calculated time ordered product ( [ tprod ] ) to the hadronic tensor using the relation @xmath41    the matrix element of the time ordered product in ( [ tprod ] ) may be expansed in a sum of local operators by performing a short distance expansion .",
    "however , there are still two large momenta involved , the momentum of the heavy meson which scales with @xmath4 and the momentum transfer to the leptons @xmath5 . in order to disentangle long and short distance contributions",
    "it is convenient to switch to the effective theory . in this process",
    "the heavy hadron momentum is rescaled and only the small residual momentum remains . as will become clear below , the relevant momentum transfer variable will be @xmath42 which we assume to be the only large scale in the problem .",
    "once we are working in the effective theory .",
    "an operator product expansion will be an expansion in inverse powers of @xmath7 .",
    "switching to the effective field theory allows to scale out the large parameter @xmath43 .",
    "the relevant momentum variable characterizing the initial state is then a small momentum , namely the residual momentum @xmath44 of the heavy quark .",
    "matching the effective and the full theory to lowest order in the @xmath9 and @xmath45 expansion one has to replace @xmath46 where the @xmath26 dependence of the static heavy quark field @xmath47 is due to the residual momentum @xmath0 .",
    "injecting this into the hadronic tensor one obtains @xmath48    an operator product expansion ( i.e. a short distance expansion ) is justified , if the momentum transfer variable @xmath42 is large compared to the residual momentum @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , switching to heavy quark effective theory implies an expansion in powers of @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast to @xcite we shall consider the portion of phase space in which @xmath49 and thus the lowest order term in the @xmath9 expansion is sufficient . hence we may use ( [ htens ] ) as the starting point .    using momentum conservation @xmath50",
    "we find that an operator product expansion is possible for @xmath51 and that this expansion is a power series expansion in powers of @xmath52 , up to logarithmic terms which may be resummed by renormalization group techniques .",
    "note that , if @xmath53 is much smaller than @xmath43 , the use of the effective theory to lowest order is justified , since higher order corrections to the effective theory will be of the order @xmath54 and thus will be much smaller .",
    "however , as argued above , we shall only consider @xmath39 inclusive transitions and thus @xmath55 .",
    "for this case we may use the framework of perturbative qcd to calculate the coefficients of the operator product expansion .",
    "thus we are lead to consider the time ordered product of the two currents @xmath56\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the momentum transfer variable defining the large momentum .",
    "we shall define the operator product expansion for the projection of @xmath34 needed to obtain the inclusive semileptonic rate @xmath57 before we write down the general form of the short distance expansion in the effective theory we shall recall some basic formulae concerning the spin structure in the effective theory .",
    "the sixteen covariants built from dirac matrices reduce to only four when projected into a definite velocity sector .",
    "we shall use as a basis the unit matrix and the three spin vectors @xmath58 with @xmath59 which correspond in the rest frame @xmath60 to the three pauli matrices .",
    "the translation table of the sixteen invarants is given by @xmath61 the spin vectors @xmath58 satisfy the relation @xmath62 which is a generalization of the well known relation between the pauli matrices and which may be used to reduce products of spin vectors .",
    "at tree level one may obtain the operator product expansion up to operators of dimension five by considering the two diagrams gepicted in fig.1 .",
    "the result is @xmath63 \\slash{k } ( 1-\\gamma_5 ) h_v \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\left ( \\frac{1}{{\\cal q}^2 - m_l^2 + i\\epsilon } \\right)^2      64 i \\epsilon_{\\lambda \\alpha \\beta \\rho } { \\cal q}^\\lambda           k^{\\prime \\rho }    \\bar{h}_v ( id^\\alpha ) ( id^\\beta ) \\slash{k } ( 1-\\gamma_5 ) h_v \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\left ( \\frac{1}{{\\cal q}^2 - m_l^2 + i\\epsilon } \\right)^2            128    \\bar{h}_v ( ik^\\prime d ) ( i{\\cal q } d ) \\slash{k } ( 1-\\gamma_5 ) h_v \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left ( \\frac{1}{{\\cal q}^2 - m_l^2 + i\\epsilon } \\right)^3            256 ( k^\\prime { \\cal q } )    \\bar{h}_v ( i{\\cal q } d)^2 \\slash{k } ( 1-\\gamma_5 ) h_v \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\mbox{operators of dimension six or higher } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we note that the spin structure of all the terms is of the form @xmath64 reflecting the left handedness of the current .",
    "the differential rate may now be calculated from the imaginary part of the forward matrix element of the operator @xmath65 @xmath66 the relevant hadronic matrix elements will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we shall first consider the decay of a pseudoscalar meson .",
    "the only nonvanishing matrix element of the dimension three operators is @xmath67 which is normalized as given above due to heavy quark symmetries . inserting this into ( [ lepspec ] ) reproduces the parton model result .",
    "all the matrix elements of the dimension four operators vanish .",
    "the general form of the matrix element not involving the spin vector is @xmath68 and by contraction with @xmath69 and using the equations of motion we have @xmath70 .",
    "the corresponding matrix element involving the spin vector vanishes due to parity .",
    "the matrix elements of the dimension five operators may be expressed in terms of two independent parameters . due to the equations of motion we have @xmath71 where @xmath72 as defined in the paper by falk and neubert @xcite ] is determined by the trace @xmath73 this trace",
    "is related to the expectation value of the residual momentum squared @xmath74 of the heavy quark in the heavy meson ( @xmath75 ) which is expected to be of the order of @xmath76 . unfortunately one may not extract a precise value from experimental data and one has to rely on theoretical estimates .",
    "an estimate based on qcd sum rules @xcite yields reltively large value of @xmath77 gev@xmath78 .",
    "we shall use a default value of @xmath79 gev@xmath78 and discuss the dependence of the result on this parameter .",
    "the other independent matrix elelement is parametrized as @xmath80 where the constant @xmath81 is given in terms of the scalar matrix element @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the strong coupling constant .",
    "this matrix element is related to the mass splitting between the pseudoscalar meson and its spin symmetry partner vector meson @xmath84 from which we obtain @xmath85 thus lowest order corrections in the mesonic sector are given in terms of two parameters , one of which is related to an observable quantity .",
    "the decay of a heavy ground state baryon @xmath86 has been considered in @xcite in the approach proposed in @xcite . for this decay",
    "we have two matrix elements of the dimension three operators of which the normalization is known due to heavy quark symmetries .",
    "we have @xmath87 where @xmath58 is the direction of the spin of the @xmath88 baryon in its rest frame .    as in the case of the mesons",
    "the matrix elements of the dimension four operators vanish due to parity and the equations of motion .",
    "finally , the matrix elements of the dimension five operators are given in terms of only one parameter @xmath89 , @xmath72 and @xmath81 parametrize the long distance qcd contributions to the inclusive semileptonic decay rates .",
    "since we are dealing with an operator product expansion the short distance qcd contributions may be calculated as the scale dependence of the wilson coefficients , the tree level value of which may be read off from ( [ ope ] ) .",
    "short distance corrections may be considered using the usual machinery of the renormalization group .",
    "the calculation of the short distance qcd corrections may be found in the literature .",
    "the anomalous dimensions of the scalar operators defining the constants @xmath90 , @xmath72 and @xmath81 has been performed in @xcite .    due to reparametrization invariance",
    "@xcite the operator @xmath91 @xmath92 has vanishing anomalous dimension and thus @xmath72 as well as @xmath90 are scale invariant quantities .",
    "the second operator @xmath93 @xmath94 has nonvanishing anomalous dimension but does not mix with any other operator . from the renormalization group equation with the anomalous dimension from @xcite @xmath95 one obtains @xmath96 with @xmath97 for @xmath98 hadron decays .",
    "this scale dependence introduces an @xmath7 dependence , since this is the relevant momentum transfer variable in the present case .",
    "the effect of these short distance corrections will be discussed for the example of the lepton energy spectrum in inclusive semileptonic decays of heavy mesons .",
    "as an obvious application we shall consider the lepton energy spectrum of the charged lepton in an inclusive semileptonic decay of heavy mesons . to be specific we shall consider the decay @xmath99 here @xmath12 is a hadronic final state containing charm .",
    "the differential decay rate is given by @xmath100    the calculational details of the phase space integration are not very iluminating and are given in an appendix .",
    "however , unlike in the usual case of phase space integrals we have due to the relations @xmath101 also integrations involving the first and second deriavtive of the delta function @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "flipping the derivative yields derivatives of the integrands . since the qcd short distance corrections imply a dependence of @xmath81 on the kinematic variables one has to differentiate @xmath81 as well .",
    "this yields an additive correction term which is proportional to @xmath104 taken at the scale @xmath7 ; this scale is fixed to @xmath105 due to the delta functions showing that the present approach is indeed limited to @xmath106 .",
    "the results for the lepton spectrum is displayed in fig.2 and 3 .",
    "fig.2 shows the charged lepton energy spectrum for the inclusive semileptonic decay of a @xmath107 or a @xmath108 into charmed final states .",
    "the parameters used are @xmath109 gev , @xmath110 gev , @xmath111 and @xmath112 gev@xmath78 .",
    "the solid line ( a ) is the full result , including long- and short distance corrections .",
    "this is compared to the spectrum including the corrections only at tree level , i.e.  without the qcd short distance contribution ( line ( b ) ) .",
    "finally , curve ( c ) is the leading order result which is the spectrum obtained from the parton model .",
    "the spectrum obtained this way is slightly shifted to lower energies and the short distance corrections yield a small enhancement at low energies .",
    "qualitatively this result agrees with the one obtained in @xcite .",
    "finally , we shall investigate the dependence on the parameter @xmath72 by considering the total rates .",
    "in fig.3 we plot the quantity @xmath113 in percent as a function of the value of @xmath72 .",
    "we chose the same parameters as for fig.2 , except that @xmath72 is varied in the range @xmath114 .",
    "curve ( a ) is the full result , including long- as well as short distance contributions , curve ( b ) conbtains the tree level corrections only .",
    "the corrections reduce the total rate ( compared to the parton model rate ) for values of @xmath72 above 0.1 .",
    "this seems to favor large values of @xmath72 , since a reduction of the semileptonic branching fraction is phenomenologically welcome .",
    "furthermore , one could in turn try to obtain matrix element corresponding to @xmath72 from a preceise measurement of the inclusive lepton spectrum .",
    "inclusive semileptonic decays of heavy hadrons may be described by employing an operator product expansion for the operators appearing in the hadronic tensor .",
    "the expansion is performed after switching to heavy quark effective field theory where the large momentum of the heavy hadron is scaled out .",
    "the relevant momentum transfer variable is @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the momentum transferred to the leptons .    in the present paper the region of phase space",
    "has been considered in which @xmath49 and heavy quark effective field theory to leading order in the @xmath9 expansion is sufficient .",
    "the approach of @xcite and @xcite is in fact valid in a different portion of phase space , since @xcite assume that @xmath117 and thus a simultaneous expansion in @xmath9 and @xmath10 is necessary .",
    "the lepton spectrum as obtained in @xcite contains delta functions and its derivatives which reflects the failure of the expansion at the edge of phase space @xmath118 .",
    "in contrast to that the approach applied here yields a completely smooth lepton energy spectrum without any delta function singularities .    of course , the limitations of the procedure proposed here ( namely @xmath49 ) do show up at some point .",
    "if one studies for example the rate differential in the momentum transfer @xmath119 and the total leptonic energy @xmath120 then one finds also delta functions and its derivatives entering the differential rate using the method chosen here .",
    "however , after an integration over the total leptonic energy one obtains a smooth @xmath5 spectrum and the only reminder for the breakdown of the @xmath7 expansion is a behaviour of the correction term of the type @xmath121 at the endpoint of the leptonic @xmath5 spectrum .",
    "this is an integrable singularity and hence a finite total rate may be obtained as expected .    in conclusion ,",
    "depending on the region of phase space considered one has to choose between the method proposed in @xcite and the one presented here . to obtain the lepton spectrum one has to integrate over the phase space and phase space regions contribute where the approximations used become invalid",
    ". however , both methods yield finite total rates which means that the singularities in the lepton spectrum are intagrable and one may still expect a reasonable lepton energy spectrum from both methods ; this expectation is confirmed by the qualitative agreement of the lepton energy spectra obtained from both approaches .",
