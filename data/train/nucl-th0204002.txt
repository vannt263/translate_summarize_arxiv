    "many reaction formalisms have been developed to study stable and unstable nuclei in the last few years and applied to extract structure information from scattering processes .",
    "often , there is an interplay between the structure information that should be extracted from the reaction data and the reaction process itself .",
    "thus , in each case , in order to extract reliable structure information , the adequacy of the scattering formalism needs to be addressed in detail .    of timely importance",
    "is the coupling to breakup states when the scattering process involves loosely bound nuclei . early analysis of elastic scattering with deuterons have shown that it is important to include the couplings to the continuum @xcite .",
    "more recently , the analysis of scattering reactions of loosely bound nuclei has progressed beyond the collective optical model ( om ) approach to a more microscopic treatment ( i.e. @xcite for elastic , @xcite inelastic , @xcite breakup and @xcite transfer reactions ) . in these approaches ,",
    "the few body nature of the loosely bound nucleus is incorporated _ ab initio _ in the scattering model and the coupling to the breakup channels are either introduced explicitly @xcite , effectively through polarization potentials @xcite or to all orders @xcite .",
    "the study of the coupling to the continuum in transfer processes with loosely bound nuclei is also of relevance for astrophysics .",
    "the asymptotic normalization coefficient ( anc ) method @xcite has been put forward as an alternative way to obtain information about the low energy @xmath6-factors .",
    "this method uses the absolute normalization of a peripheral transfer reaction to determine the normalization of the vertices involved in the process .",
    "its applicability depends crucially on the validity of the dwba conventionally used .",
    "the main assumptions are that the transition amplitude for the transfer can be evaluated in born approximation and that the incoming and outgoing elastic waves are properly described in terms of effective optical potentials .",
    "typically , the optical potentials used in dwba calculations are deduced from the analysis of entrance ( and exit , whenever existent ) elastic scattering data , to reduce the uncertainties of the ancs extracted from the transfer @xcite .",
    "the possibility of systematic errors in this method has been a source of concern @xcite . as a result",
    ", several tests have been performed to ensure its validity ( see for example a comparison with direct measurements @xcite or the extraction of the same information from a set of different reactions @xcite ) .",
    "very recently , the importance of coupling to excited inelastic channels of the target was assessed @xcite and results emphasize that care should be taken when choosing the target .",
    "a significant number of the unmeasured capture reactions of interest in astrophysics involve nuclei on the drip line @xcite .",
    "the proximity of threshold suggests that breakup channels may play a role in their reaction mechanism .",
    "these implications have not yet been evaluated for any of the transfer reactions used so far .",
    "a prime example is the extraction of @xmath7 from @xmath0n(@xmath8be,@xmath9b)@xmath3c at @xmath10=84  mev @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons for @xmath9b attracting much of the nuclear physics efforts is its relevance to astrophysics , namely to the solar neutrino problem @xcite .",
    "the first experiment performed with the aim of extracting an anc for @xmath2b was a @xmath11 reaction @xcite .",
    "meanwhile two transfer reactions on medium mass targets were measured with the same aim : @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath0n(@xmath8be,@xmath9b)@xmath3c @xcite both at @xmath10=84  mev .",
    "the joint analysis of these reactions @xcite provided an accuracy for @xmath13 greater than that of the direct capture measurements @xcite . coupled channel estimates @xcite showed that the excited states of the target can have a strong influence when the target is @xmath14b but not when @xmath0n is used .",
    "consequently , the @xmath13 value extracted from @xmath15b(@xmath8be,@xmath9b)@xmath16be should not be used without further inelastic studies , but the value extracted from @xmath0n(@xmath8be,@xmath9b)@xmath3c remains valid up to now . until recently , @xmath7 extracted from both the transfer reaction of @xcite and the coulomb dissociation data @xcite were consistent with the direct capture measurements .",
    "however , the very recent direct capture data from seattle @xcite not only improves the accuracy , but provides a @xmath13 @xmath17 larger than the previous values . whilst differences within the direct capture data sets are being understood , all sources of possible systematic errors in the analysis of the data from indirect methods need to be checked . given that , in @xmath18b",
    ", the proton is bound by only 0.137 mev , one can suspect that coupling to continuum states may play an important role in the reaction dynamics and affect the anc results .",
    "the aim of this work is thus to study consistently the effects of continuum couplings of @xmath9b , both in the elastic scattering and the transfer process . in section",
    "ii we discuss the formalism used in both kinds of processes . in section",
    "iii we analyze the elastic scattering of @xmath9b+@xmath3c and discuss the effects of coupling to the continuum in the calculated differential cross section . in section iv , we analyze the transfer reaction @xmath0n(@xmath8be,@xmath9b)@xmath3c using the cdcc - ba framework : born approximation ( ba ) for the transfer couplings and coupled channel continuum discretization ( cdcc ) for the @xmath18b continuum couplings . finally in section v the conclusions of the work are drawn .",
    "as mentioned previously , @xmath19 is a weakly bound system with a breakup @xmath20+@xmath8be threshold close to the ground state . for many purposes this nucleus",
    "can be well described by a two cluster model in which the valence proton is coupled to a @xmath8be inert core ( e.g. @xcite ) . in order to include the @xmath9b continuum states as intermediate steps in the elastic or transfer process we make use of the cdcc formalism @xcite .",
    "consider the 3-body scattering problem of a composite nucleus @xmath21 = @xmath22 impinging on a stable nucleus @xmath23 .",
    "the full hamiltonian for the problem is @xmath24 where the hamiltonian for the composite nucleus @xmath21 is @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the sum of interaction between the clusters and the stable nucleus @xmath23 , @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath28 be the @xmath29 separation , and @xmath30 the projectile - target coordinate .    for simplicity ,",
    "we ignore the internal spins in the notation , and consider only excitations of the projectile @xmath21 . keeping in mind the application to loosely bound nuclei , we assume that @xmath21 has only one bound state . then @xmath31 defines the ground state wavefunction and @xmath32 defines the continuum states ( labeled by the angular momentum @xmath33 , its projection @xmath34 , and the linear momentum , @xmath35 ) .",
    "the cdcc method makes a double truncation of the continuum in both energy and angular momentum , working in the subspace @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , the excitation energy range is subdivided into a number of intervals , usually called _",
    "bins_. for each such bin a representative square integrable wavefunction is constructed , by an appropriate superposition of the continuum functions inside the bin .",
    "thus , for a total angular momentum @xmath38 with projection @xmath39 , the cdcc scattering wave function for the @xmath40 system is expanded as @xmath41_{jm}\\chi ^{j}_{0,l}(r ) \\nonumber \\\\",
    "+ \\sum ^{\\ell _ { max}}_{\\ell = 0}\\sum ^{j+\\ell } _ { l=|j-\\ell |}\\sum ^{n}_{i=1}\\chi ^{j}_{i , l}(r)\\left [ \\phi _ { i,\\ell } ( \\mathbf{r})\\otimes y_{l}(\\hat{r})\\right ] _ { jm}\\ , , \\ ] ] with @xmath42 . here",
    "@xmath43 are the bin wavefunctions ; @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the radial wavefunctions for the relative motion between @xmath23 and @xmath46 .    the radial functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 are determined by solving a set of coupled equations in the truncated space .",
    "the coupling potentials between different channels are given by:@xmath49 where it is understood that @xmath50=0 stands for the ground state .",
    "these coupling potentials include the g.s - g.s matrix element ( also known as the watanabe potential ) , g.s .- continuum terms and continuum - continuum couplings .",
    "the latter can be handled in the same way as the others because the continuum bins have been made square integrable .",
    "the wavefunction ( [ eq : wfcdcc ] ) permits the description of the elastic and breakup processes for the reaction @xmath51 .",
    "let us now consider the transfer reaction @xmath52 , where we have chosen the notation such that the exit channel of the transfer corresponds to the elastic channel presented above .",
    "the prior form of the transition amplitude for the transfer reaction process is @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the the potential which binds the @xmath55 valence particle to the @xmath23 core , @xmath56 is the core - core potential , and @xmath57 is an arbitrary potential that generates the distorted wave function in the entrance channel @xmath58 . note that @xmath59 is the total exact wave function with outgoing boundary conditions . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tprior ] ) , @xmath54 is a real potential , while @xmath57 can be chosen either as real or complex .",
    "it is usually chosen as the optical potential @xmath60 which reproduces the elastic scattering in the entrance channel .",
    "in practice , eq .",
    "( [ eq : tprior ] ) is not directly used , as it requires the knowledge of the exact solution of the 3-body schrdinger scattering equation for the entrance partition , a rather complicated problem on its own .",
    "approximations of this general form are developed according to the desired applications .",
    "when the coupling between the partitions @xmath61 and @xmath51 is sufficiently weak , the transfer process can be treated in born approximation . even in this situation , if the coupling to some excited states of any of the partitions is strong , the transfer process can proceed via these intermediate states . in these circumstances , it is convenient to solve the coupled equations that include the couplings between the different excited states , followed by the calculation of the transfer in born approximation .",
    "this procedure is known as the ccba method ( coupled channels born approximation ) .",
    "when the coupling between the excited states of the same partition are weak , a further approximation is commonly performed , by neglecting the explicit coupling to these states .",
    "this procedure is known as distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) .",
    "even when the couplings are not so weak , they may be at least partially taken into account by an appropriate choice of the optical potentials .",
    "when weakly bound nuclei are involved , the ccba is expected to be a reasonable approach , because the transfer cross section is small due to the unfavorable @xmath62matching .",
    "however , couplings to continuum states may still be important , as these can act as intermediate steps in the rearrangement process .",
    "it is not obvious that the dwba approach properly accounts for these continuum effects .",
    "nevertheless , this procedure has been used recently in the analysis of reactions involving weakly bound systems as a tool to extract the anc information .",
    "therefore , it is timely to perform a detailed analysis of the scattering frameworks used to described the transfer processes . in particular , it is relevant to investigate to what extent the effects of the coupling to the continuum can be incorporated effectively in the optical potentials used by the dwba approach .    in the case of elastic and inelastic scattering ,",
    "a common procedure is to represent the continuum spectrum in @xmath59 by a finite set of normalizable states , such as the cdcc expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wfcdcc ] ) . when rearrangement channels are to be considered , as in eq .",
    "(    [ eq : tprior ] ) , because the transfer step itself is not strong we can plausibly approximate the exact wavefunction appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tprior ] ) by the cdcc wavefunction of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wfcdcc ] ) .",
    "this procedure is called the cdcc - ba method . in cdcc - ba",
    "the exact transition amplitude is approximated by : @xmath63 all couplings included in the cdcc - ba applied to the ( @xmath64be,@xmath18b ) case are schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : b8_coup ] .",
    "our choice of the prior representation for the transfer matrix element is not arbitrary . in post form ,",
    "the binding interaction is that of the exiting projectile @xmath65 and the remnant term is the difference between the core - core interaction @xmath56 , and the optical potential for the exit channel @xmath66 .",
    "however , this exit channel optical potential is often unknown : contrary to the entrance channel elastic data , elastic scattering in the exit channel can not be measured in the same experiment , and in many cases it is just unmeasurable as both projectile and target are radioactive .",
    "it can then be found either by fitting the scattering from the cdcc model , or by extrapolating from neighboring nuclei .",
    "the prior form of the cdcc - ba approach , by contrast , does not require any knowledge of the optical potential @xmath67 for this exit channel .",
    "it seems more appropriate , therefore , to use the prior form representation of the transition operator and , consequently , all the calculations presented hereafter were performed in this representation .",
    "the further approximation of the cdcc by just its elastic channel , found with some optical potential @xmath67 , gives the dwba transition amplitude in prior form : @xmath68 this simple approximation , very commonly used in anc analyses , still requires knowledge of the optical potential for the exit channel @xmath66 , and hence suffers from the difficulties enumerated above .",
    "however , if the transfer cross sections are not very sensitive to this potential , then the dwba will still be a useful procedure .",
    "we examine this sensitivity below , by studying the degree of agreement between the dwba and the cdcc . in both approaches ,",
    "the remnant term of the transition matrix element for systems where a nucleon is transferred from a well bound state to a loosely bound state ( or vice - versa ) is often not negligible and should be accounted for properly .",

    "in particular , we study the importance of the continuum in the calculated differential cross section .",
    "this reaction was previously analyzed in the work of @xcite using a renormalized double folding ( rdf ) potential obtained by an analysis of nearby stable nuclei .",
    "a parameterization of this rdf potential in terms of usual woods - saxon forms was also derived by fitting the outer part of the rdf potential .",
    "since these fitted potentials may differ in the inner part from the original rdf potentials , we used the latter in our calculations , as in the results presented in @xcite .",
    "as this interaction is derived from a systematic study on stable nuclei , it is not clear how adequate are these extrapolations to loosely bound nuclei .",
    "elastic data for @xmath9b + @xmath3c would help to shed light on these issues .    in this section",
    "we analyze the same reaction in terms of the cdcc formalism , for two reasons .",
    "first , this treatment allows an explicit study of the role of the continuum and , second , it provides an alternative analysis to the rdf which does not require the optical potential for @xmath9b + @xmath3c , thus providing a valuable reference in the absence of experimental data .",

    "<S> we have studied the transfer reaction @xmath0n(@xmath1be,@xmath2b)@xmath3c at @xmath4  mev , paying special attention to the effects of the coupling to the continuum in the exit channel . using the continuum discretized coupled channels ( cdcc ) formalism , we find that these effects are important for the description of the elastic scattering observables . however , for the transfer process , differences between the predictions of the differential cross section within the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) and the cdcc - born approximation ( cdcc - ba ) are found to be negligible . </S>",
    "<S> this result supports the use of the dwba method as a reliable tool to extract the @xmath5 factor in this case . </S>"
