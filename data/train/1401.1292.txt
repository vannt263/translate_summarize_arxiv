    ", such scaling laws could allow for a characterization of the data and the generating complex system by fractal ( or multifractal ) scaling exponents , which can reflect the characteristics of the systems in comparison with other systems and with different models . such fractal ( or multifractal ) scaling behavior has been observed in many time series from experimental physics , geophysics , physiology , etc .",
    "since these time series have many features in common , it would lead one to suggest a unified approach to study their behavior .",
    "many different methods have been developed to analyze these nonlinear time series . in many of the studies on time",
    "series of these complex systems , researchers would assume they obey some stochastic processes , with stochastic differential equations of the type @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the variable that we are interested in , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are variables that can depend on @xmath1 and @xmath4 , the time and @xmath5 is a wiener process .",
    "the time series generated is also assumed to have some long - range correlations .",
    "we will take the above equation as our starting point .",
    "one can indeed ask a straightforward but also fundamental question  how close can the evolution of these nonlinear time series be described by stochastic processes that follow eq.([eqn1 ] ) ? from a practical point of view , one would just assume that the empirical time series follows exactly a stochastic process governed by eq.([eqn1 ] ) .",
    "one would then decompose the empirical time series @xmath6 into its components @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath7 as suggested by eq.([eqn1 ] ) by some optimization methods and to quantitatively measure its deviation from a stochastic process .",
    "one could further investigate the multifractal structures embedded in these time series . from the computational point of view , this requires one to develop more efficient numerical algorithms in order to perform an effective optimization search for the resulting decomposed time series .",
    "we will demonstrate this with a simple empirical algorithm in the present study and show how one can use the results obtained from the optimization search to investigate the interesting properties embedded in the time series .    among the many nonlinear time series , of particular interest and also being intensively studied are financial time series .",
    "many established facts ( or stylized facts as commonly called by practitioners in the field of economics and finance ) in financial time series have already been identified and well documented@xcite .",
    "these include e.g. , the heavy tail distributions of asset returns and volatility clustering .",
    "it is found that the heavy tail distributions of asset return exhibit power law behavior over several orders of magnitude .",
    "furthermore , the volatility exhibits long range correlations following an approximate power law while its fluctuations are randomly distributed and follow approximately a lognormal distribution@xcite . such scaling behavior suggests that the time series might have a multifractal structure , which could reflect the characteristics of the systems in comparison with other systems and with various models .",
    "these structures will certainly help researchers build better models to describe the underlying dynamics of financial markets and complex systems in general@xcite .",
    "we will therefore choose the financial time series here as an example of our empirical study of nonlinear time series .",
    "however , the empirical algorithm used here can also be applied to time series of other complex systems .",
    "indeed , it is known that time series of many complex systems reveal behaviors that are similar to the stylized facts observed in financial time series . in financial markets , prices of stocks and commodities fluctuate over time , which then produce financial time series .",
    "these time series are in fact of great interest both to practitioners and theoreticians for making inferences and predictions .",
    "historically , it is noted that the well - known efficient market hypothesis@xcite has a very close link to the stochasticity of the financial market . in the case of financial time",
    "series , the stock prices @xmath8 at time @xmath4 are generally assumed to be an approximate ito process given by the following form , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the instantaneous risk free rate , @xmath11 is the local volatility , and @xmath12 is a wiener process , representing the inflow of randomness into the dynamics .",
    "the amplitude of this randomness is measured by the local volatility @xmath11 whose amplitude is usually related to risk in the market . it should be noted that @xmath10 is a parameter that may depend on @xmath8 , @xmath11 and @xmath4 .",
    "when analyzing financial time series , researchers usually assume @xmath10 and @xmath11 to take some constant values . in reality",
    ", the amplitude of @xmath11 is usually related to risk and its value can therefore vary as time evolves .",
    "figure [ fig1](a ) is a plot of the empirical data of the daily returns for the nasdaq composite index from february 8 , 1971 through june 13 , 2012 , while figure [ fig1](b ) is the probability density function of the normalized daily returns for the same period .",
    "it is easy to see , that the distribution in figure [ fig1](b ) has heavy tails on both ends and is far from a gaussian distribution . if the fluctuations of the daily returns of the index obeyed the form as suggested by eq.([eqn2 ] ) , @xmath11 could not be a constant over the time period under study and should instead vary as a function of time .",
    "it is noted that many time series of different complex systems also exhibit behavior similar to that of figure [ fig1](b ) , e.g. , heart rate variability@xcite .",

    ", width=302 ]    based on the assumption that financial time series should evolve very closely to stochastic processes , researchers also introduced the concept of stochastic volatility , assuming that the change of @xmath11 also follows a stochastic process . over the years , many stochastic volatility models@xcite",
    "have been proposed to evaluate derivative securities , such as options .",
    "for example , hull and white@xcite proposed that the stochastic volatility obeys a stochastic differential equation of the type @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are functions depending on @xmath8 , @xmath11 and @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath16 is another wiener process which can have correlation @xmath17 with @xmath18 . in general , the actual time evolving process that the stochastic variance @xmath19 follows could be very complex .    for a time series of eq.([eqn1 ] ) to exhibit fractal behavior , the absolute moments of the change of its parameter @xmath1 should take the following scaling form@xcite , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a prefactor which depends on @xmath22 and @xmath23 is a function of @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath24 here stands for the expectation value of the subject in the bracket . from the multifractal theory",
    ", there should exist an @xmath23 for each moment @xmath22 , such that @xmath25 scales with @xmath26 , with the prefactor @xmath21 as the scale @xmath27 .",

    "@xmath30 is said to be monofractal . if @xmath23 is a nonlinear function in @xmath22 , @xmath30",
    "is then said to be multifractal .",
    "although the underlying causes of the observed scaling are often not known in detail , the fractal or multifractal characterization can be useful to model the corresponding time series , and to give predictions regarding extreme events or future behavior .",
    "in recent years , there exist a considerable number of papers devoted to the modeling of multifractality in nonlinear time series , pioneered by mandelbrot and his collaborators@xcite . in their work , they developed a multifractal model of asset returns ( mmar ) , which is a continuous - time process that captures the heavy tails and long - memory volatility persistence that are exhibited by many financial time series .",
    "it is constructed by combining a standard brownian motion with a random time deformation process that is specified to be multifractal .",
    "subsequently , other researchers have introduced other multifractal models , noticeably bacry et.al.@xcite . in order to model asset return fluctuations",
    ", these authors introduced a multifractal random walk process to describe the behavior of financial time series which they call multifractal random walk model ( mrw ) .",
    "it is a generalization of the mandelbrot cascades to stationary , causal continuous cascades .",
    "this model is able to describe many of the stylized facts of financial time series with satisfaction . in its original form",
    ", mrw can simply be considered as a stochastic volatility model where the ( log- ) volatility memory has a peculiar logarithmic shape , a feature in agreement with empirical observation .",
    "this model receives much attention because of its simplicity .",
    "there also exist analytic solutions for this model@xcite and one could therefore fit the set of parameters in the model to the empirical data in a more precise way .",
    "during the past decade , these multifractal models have been used to study time series of complex systems on various topics@xcite .    closely related to the question of stochasticity",
    ", one could also ask how well a stochastic volatility model , such as that of the type of eq.([eqn3 ] ) can model the nonlinear time series data under study . in this case , one would need to decompose the empirical time series into the form as suggested by eq.([eqn2 ] ) and ( [ eqn3 ] ) and quantitatively measure its deviation from a stochastic process . one",
    "would then be able to investigate the multifractality of the nonlinear time series as well as to study the detail of the local volatility @xmath11 itself .",
    "we should also mention here that one should be aware of the fact that the apparent multifractal behavior in financial time series could also be a result of multiscaling in the time series@xcite and possibly other unknown factors .    in the following",
    ", we will describe how one can use a simple empirical optimization algorithm to quantitatively analyze nonlinear time series with the assumption that both the stock prices and volatility evolve according to some stochastic processes . in this way",
    ", one can quantitatively measure the deviation from stochasticity of the system and compare it with other systems of similar nature .",
    "likewise , one can analyze the multifractal structure of the time series and compare with models .",
    "one could also build models that would describe the behavior of the system under study . in section 2",
    ", we will introduce the empirical algorithm for the analysis of stochasticity of a system under study . in section 3",
    ", we present the result by using our method on simulated time series with different distributions of fluctuations .",
    "section 4 contains the results obtained from empirical data and section 5 is the conclusion .",
    "we here assume that both the stock prices and the volatility evolve stochastically as the starting point .",
    "we can also take eq.([eqn1 ] ) for the stock prices alone as the starting point if we do not want to put any assumption on @xmath11 .",
    "one can of course use other assumptions that one deems to be appropriate as the starting point for the time series under study . in the study of financial time",
    "series , there are various definitions of the volatility used by researchers . in our case , since we want to use a consistent algorithm to evaluate the volatility @xmath11 in eq.([eqn2 ] ) without assuming any particular form , we will therefore define it to be the local function such that the fluctuations of @xmath31 are a result of the product of this function and a distribution of fluctuations that should be as close to @xmath32 as possible , i.e. , a wiener process in accordance with the assumption of eq.([eqn2 ] )",
    ". this will be useful as a general algorithm if one wants to study time series from different complex systems . to make things simple , we here assume that @xmath10 is a constant throughout the time series under study",
    ". we will then average over the whole time series and get the mean value of @xmath31 .",
    "we then subtract this mean value from each @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the @xmath34-th data point ( time step ) of the time series , so that the mean , and effectively @xmath10 of the new time series is equal to zero . in the next step , we will look for the local volatility @xmath11 at each time step of this new time series .",
    "we will look for the local volatility @xmath11 of the time series such that the asset return time series ( after subtracting the mean of the whole time series ) will be a product of this local volatility and a process that is as close to a wiener process as possible .",
    "deviation of the reconstructed @xmath32 from a wiener process would be regarded as a measure of the deviation of this time series from the stochastic process as defined by eq.([eqn2 ] ) . to proceed ,",
    "one can of course perform an optimization search that constrains @xmath32 to be as close to a wiener process as possible and numerically find the empirical local volatility for the time series .",
    "this is however very time consuming and inefficient .",
    "therefore we will do this in two steps . in the first step ,",
    "we compute the local volatility @xmath11 of the time series by using the moving window approach .",
    "one then use this function as a starting point to perform an optimization search subject to the constraints that we mentioned above in order to obtain the local volatility function . to carry out this procedure , a moving window with size",
    "@xmath35 is first chosen .",
    "we put the window on the first event of the asset returns sequence and calculate the volatility of the first @xmath35 events by adding the square of their values and dividing the sum by @xmath35 .",
    "we then move the window to the second event and again calculate the volatility of the next @xmath35 events by adding the square of their values and divide the sum by @xmath35 .",
    "we repeat the same procedure until we finish scanning through the whole asset return sequence . as a matter of fact",
    ", one can also choose @xmath35 to be a varying number instead of a constant .",
    "we should remark here that if one only performs a moving window average without further optimizing @xmath32 against a wiener process , the resulting distribution of the fluctuations of the volatility would be significantly different from a lognormal distribution .",
    "the next step is to carry out an optimization search to get the empirical local volatility function of the financial time series under study . in order to perform an optimization search",
    ", one needs to introduce a cost function . in general , if one carried out an optimization search on financial time series by using eq.([eqn2 ] ) alone , the resulting local volatility @xmath11 would have a distribution of its fluctuations close to that of a lognormal distribution , a stylized fact that is already known .",
    "one can of course perform a more specific analysis , e.g. , by optimizing with respect to a specific model or a class of models . in this way",
    ", one could also investigate how well the models would describe the time series under study .",
    "for our purpose , we will only assume in addition that the local volatility of the financial time series has fluctuations that follow a lognormal distribution function without further specification .",
    "this is consistent with the stylized fact in financial time series that the fluctuations of the volatility obey an approximate lognormal distribution . for time series of other complex systems",
    ", one may need to introduce other constraints in the cost function . in the optimization search here",
    ", we will therefore optimize @xmath32 and @xmath36 against wiener processes in order to obtain the local volatility @xmath11 .",
    "the idea , as mentioned above is to minimize the sum of the deviation of @xmath36 and @xmath32 from gaussian distributions in the cost function .",
    "one would then proceed to obtain the local volatility @xmath11 by using some optimization algorithms to optimize this cost function . in this paper",
    ", we use genetic algorithm ( ga)@xcite to do the optimization search .",
    "we here adopt the standard procedures of genetic algorithm to do the search , i.e. , in each generation , we carry out the operations of mutation , crossover and selection . in our optimization search , we use a population size of 500 chromosomes , each with the length equivalent to the number of data points in the time series under study .",
    "to begin with , we generate a configuration for each chromosome in the population .",
    "we then carry out the genetic operators : crossover , mutation and selection .",
    "we now pick a number of pairs ( in our study , we pick about 20% of the population ) of parent chromosomes for the crossover procedure .",
    "we randomly pick a crossover point in each of the pair of parent chromosomes and make the crossover to produce a pair of baby chromosomes .",
    "next , we carry out the mutation operator . for the mutation operator",
    ", we set a mutation rate ( between 0 and 10% in our tests ) for the whole population and randomly choose the sites within the chromosomes to mutate .",
    "we now have a population of chromosomes consisting of the chromosomes from the original population plus the new baby chromosomes from mutation and crossover .",
    "we then calculate the value of the cost function for each of these chromosomes .",
    "we next select a certain number of chromosomes ( 500 in this case ) with better fitness for the next generation",
    ". we will again carry out the same set of genetic operators ( mutation , crossover and selection ) in the new generation until the optimization search stops for some preset criteria .",
    "the cost function @xmath37 ( or fitness as commonly called in ga ) used in our search is as follows    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is a constant whose value one can choose and @xmath40 is the difference of the area under the curve of the distribution of @xmath32 and that of the gaussian distribution . in our optimization search , we choose @xmath39 to be between 1 and 2 and we have performed the search for 500 generations .    from the optimization search , we now obtain the local volatility @xmath11 , its fluctuations @xmath36 and the fluctuations of the asset return @xmath32 .",
    "we can then plot the distribution of the fluctuations and compare with that of the distribution of a wiener process . to put this on a more quantitative basis",
    ", one can define a quantity for each of the above distributions as the deviation of the distribution under study from a wiener process .",
    "mathematically , a wiener process has independent increments which will give a gaussian distribution .",
    "we therefore define @xmath41 as the absolute value of the difference of the area under the curve of the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath32 obtained from the optimization search and the curve of the pdf of a wiener process , i.e. , the non - overlapping region of the two distributions , divided by the sum of the area of the two .    @xmath42    where @xmath43 stands for the area of the subject in the bracket .",
    "figure [ twogaussian ] is an illustrative diagram of eq.([eqn6 ] ) .",
    "curves 1 and 2 are the pdf of @xmath32 and a wiener process respectively .",
    "the gray area is the non - overlapping region of the pdf of the two distributions corresponding to the numerator in eq.([eqn6 ] ) .",
    "since both @xmath44 and @xmath45 are normalized to 1 , the denominator is therefore equal to 2 , as is shown in the last equality in the above equation .",
    "if @xmath32 is exactly equal to a wiener process , there is perfect overlap and the difference is zero .",
    "on the other hand , if the pdf of @xmath32 and the wiener process have no overlap at all , the difference as defined in the numerator of @xmath41 will be equal to the sum of the two distributions .",
    "the parameter @xmath41 therefore has a value between 0 and 1 .",
    "the larger @xmath41 is , the more the time series deviates from a wiener process . in general , one believes that the time evolution of an efficient market should follow very closely to that of a wiener process and therefore @xmath41 will be very small .",
    "large deviation from zero would indicate that the market is not totally efficient , or affected by other factors such as human psychology . using this parameter",
    ", one can compare different financial time series and also understand how efficient a financial market is .",
    "this will then be a simple quantitative way for one to compare the efficiency of financial markets against each other and see how much they deviate from a wiener process .     in eq.([eqn6 ] ) .",

    "@xmath47 with the reconstructed local volatility @xmath11 , its fluctuations @xmath36 and the fluctuations of the asset return @xmath32 in hand , one can further carry out analysis of other features and compare the result with the well - known stylized facts in financial markets .",
