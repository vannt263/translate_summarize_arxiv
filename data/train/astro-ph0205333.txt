    "there were 2  observations of a1835 , with the cluster in the acis s3 chip in both .",
    "one ( obsid 495 ) with a 19 ks exposure was performed on 1999 - 12 - 11 , and another ( obsid 496 ) with an 11 ks exposure was done on 2000 - 04 - 29 .",
    "schmidt et al .  used only obsid 495 for their spectral analysis .",
    "they used 0.57 kev energy band for spectral fitting and the public blank field dataset for background modeling . in obsid 495 , only one backside - illuminated ( bi ) chip , s3 ,",
    "was used , and it was almost completely covered by the cluster emission .",
    "this presents a difficulty for identifying the background flares ( see markevitch 2001a ) using the background light curve .",
    "a light curve extracted from a region of the s3 chip far from the cluster center does not vary beyond the normally acceptable @xmath5% range from the mean ( in agreement with the schmidt et al .",
    "conclusions ) , although due to the cluster contamination , one can not compare that mean value to the nominal background rate . in obsid 496 , one can also use s1 ( another bi chip ) for flare detection ; neither s1 nor s3 ( its part far from the cluster center ) show any flares .    since the quiescent background is known to vary on long and short timescales at a few percent level , for each observation , i calculated the normalizations of the corresponding blank - field datasets from the ratios of count rates in the 10 - 12 kev band ( which is free of the source emission and of the most common variety of flares ) .",

    "1997 ) and thus has anomalously high sky background at @xmath7 kev . since the public acis background datasets represent the average high galactic latitude background ( see markevitch 2001b ) , this anomaly should be taken into account . to evaluate this soft background excess ,",
    "i extracted spectra from acis chips far from the cluster , subtracted the nominal background , and fit the residuals by an arbitrary model ( i used low - temperature mekal with solar abundances ) .",
    "this best - fit model ( renormalized by the ratio of the solid angles ) can then be added to the fits in the interesting cluster regions .",
    "this properly takes vignetting into account , assuming that the excess component is indeed celestial in origin and does not vary on the acis fov scale .",
    "this method was used for  analysis by markevitch & vikhlinin ( 2001 ) , and a similar method ( without the modeling step ) was used for  by pratt et al.(2001 ) and majerowicz et al .    for this procedure , a region of chips i2 and i3 at @xmath8 ( 3 mpc )",
    "was used for obsid 495 , and the s1 chip was used for obsid 496 .",
    "i created subsets of the blank - sky background datasets for the respective time periods ( ` b ' for obsid 495 and ` c ' for obsid 496 ) that included exactly the same blank fields for s3 and those other chips ( the next release of the public background files will include such subsets ) .",

    "the most frequent one affects only the bi chips and is not seen in fi chips . in obsid 495 , there are no flares in the fi chips ( this can be established confidently using the regions free of cluster emission covered by those chips ) .",
    "thus the putative flare in chip s3 should belong to this species .",
    "such flares appear to have the same spectral shape regardless of their brightness , and are well - described by a power law with the photon index @xmath10 and an exponential cutoff at @xmath11 kev ( markevitch et al .",

    "thus , the hard excess in obsid 495 is consistent with a mild residual background flare .",

    "[ fig : psf ] , one can obtain single - temperature epic fits very close to those reported . in particular , for the 2nd annulus , i obtain 6.46.8 kev compared to s 8 kev . for the 3rd annulus , i obtain 7.07.7 kev compared to s 9 kev .",
