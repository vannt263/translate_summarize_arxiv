    "in the late 50 s newman and chrenko presented a pioneering infrared absorption study in nio@xcite . among other results they showed a band at 0.24ev that correlated with the disappearance of antiferromagnetism above the nel temperature and hence of likely magnetic origin .",
    "this was very puzzling because in the nacl structure , with an o at an inversion center , a direct magnetic absorption is not allowed@xcite .",
    "in fact in a typical two magnon excitation , like for example , two spin flips on adjacent metals atoms , all relaxation of charge in the excited state is symmetric with no net dipole moment .",
    "an explanation of this puzzle was given by mizuno and koide@xcite who observed that the joint absorption process of a phonon and two magnons is allowed since then the symmetry of the lattice , after the phonon excitation , is effectively lower . to the best of our knowledge no detailed theory existed of this effect .",

    "the propose of this paper is to present a detailed theory of phonon - assisted multimagnon infrared absorption .",

    "we need to solve the two - magnon problem for arbitrary total momentum .",

    "the narrow primary peak reproduced in fig .",

    "it consists of a long lived virtual bound state of magnons referred to here as a bimagnon .",
