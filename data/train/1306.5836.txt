    "many physical systems , such as power systems and economic systems , often suffer from random changes in their parameters .",
    "these parameter changes may result from abrupt environmental disturbances , component failures or repairs , etc .",
    "in many cases , a markov chain provides a suitable model to describe the system parameter changes .",
    "a markovian jump system is a hybrid system with different operation modes .",
    "each operation mode corresponds to a deterministic system and the jumping transition from one mode to another is governed by a markov chain .",
    "recently , markovian jump systems have received a lot of attention and many control issues have been studied , such as stability and stabilization  @xcite , time delay  @xcite , filtering  @xcite , @xmath0 control  @xcite , @xmath1 control  @xcite , model reduction  @xcite . for more information on markovian jump systems ,",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the decentralized stabilization problem for a class of uncertain markovian jump large - scale systems .",
    "the aim is to design a set of appropriate local feedback control laws , such that the resulting closed - loop large - scale system is stable even in the presence of uncertainties .",
    "recently , the decentralized stabilization problem for markovian jump large - scale systems has been investigated in the literature ; see e.g. ,  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "it is important to point out that the stabilizing techniques developed in  @xcite and many other papers are built upon an implicit assumption that the mode information of the large - scale system must be known to all of the local controllers . in other words ,",
    "the mode information of all the subsystems must be measured and then broadcast to every local controller .",
    "such an assumption , however , may be unrealistic either because the broadcast of mode information among the subsystems is impossible in practice or because the implementation is expensive .    to eliminate the need for broadcasting mode information , a local mode dependent control approach has been developed in  @xcite . this control approach is fully decentralized .",
    "the local controllers use only local subsystem states or outputs and local subsystem mode information to generate local control inputs . to emphasize this feature ,",
    "this type of controller is referred to as a _ local mode dependent controller _ in  @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite , the local mode dependent control approach offers many advantages in practice .",
    "first , it eliminates the need for broadcasting mode information among the subsystems and hence is more suitable for practical applications .",
    "second , it significantly reduces the number of control gains and hence results in cost reduction , easier installation and maintenance .    in this paper , we focus on the state feedback case of markovian jump large - scale systems and aim to build a bridge between the results in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we assume that each local controller is able to access and utilize mode information of its neighboring subsystems including the subsystem it controls .",
    "this assumption is motivated by the fact that some subsystems may be close to each other in practice and hence exchange of mode information may be possible among these subsystems . under this assumption",
    ", we develop an approach , which we call a  _ neighboring mode dependent control approach _ , to stabilize markovian jump large - scale systems .",
    "compared to the local mode dependent control approach , our approach can stabilize a wider range of large - scale systems in practice .",
    "it is demonstrated in the numerical section that the system performance will improve as more detailed mode information is available to the local controllers .",
    "hence the system performance achieved by our approach is better than that achieved by the local mode dependent control approach .",

    "that is , the inequality   holds .",
    "then , by theorem  [ thm2 ] , the constructed controllers   stabilize the large - scale system   with the uncertainty constraints  ,  .    in  @xcite , a control gain form has been proposed for the design of local mode dependent controllers .",
    "that is , each local mode dependent control gain is chosen to be a weighted average of the related global mode dependent control gains .",
    "this particular gain form is then incorporated into the coupled lmis from which the local mode dependent control gains are computed ; see theorem  3 and theorem  4 in  @xcite for details . unfortunately , choosing such a gain form is not helpful in terms of an improvement in system performance , and sometimes may even result in infeasibility of the corresponding lmis .",
    "a demonstration of this fact is given in section  [ sec : ie ] .",
    "indeed , such a gain form imposes an additional constraint and hence is not used in this paper .",
    "consider the markovian jump large - scale system given in  @xcite .",
    "the mode information is @xmath212^{t},[1,2,2]^{t},[2,1,2]^{t},[2,2,1]^{t}\\right\\}}$ ] .",
    "the initial distribution of @xmath49 is assumed to be the same as its stationary distribution @xmath213^{t}$ ] , which can be computed from the infinitesimal generator matrix @xmath214 . given a neighboring mode information pattern @xmath215 , our objective is to find the corresponding neighboring mode dependent stabilizing controllers for this large - scale system .",
    "an upper bound on the quadratic cost   is also evaluated for the resulting closed - loop large - scale system .",
    "the main software we use is the lmirank toolbox  @xcite .",
    "the procedure is summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "solve the optimization problem @xmath216x_{i0}<\\gamma,\\\\ & \\text{and~\\eqref{eq : lmi},~\\eqref{eq : theorem2lmi},~\\eqref{beta_inverse},~\\eqref{x_inverse}}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if an optimal value @xmath217 is found , feasible neighboring mode dependent control gains   are obtained .",
    "2 .   apply the obtained controllers to the large - scale system   and compute the cost upper bound for the resulting closed - loop large - scale system .",
    "the method for computing this upper bound is taken from  @xcite .",
    "it involves solving a worst - case performance analysis problem .",
    "five cases are considered , i.e. , @xmath218 it can be seen that each neighboring mode information pattern contains more mode information than the preceding one .",
    "@xmath219 corresponds to the local mode dependent control case , while @xmath220 corresponds to the global mode dependent control case . by using the preceding procedure , neighboring mode dependent",
    "stabilizing controllers are found for each of these cases .",
    "furthermore , if we apply the obtained controllers to the large - scale system , the cost upper bounds for the resulting closed - loop large - scale systems are shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "note that the cost upper bound found here in the local mode dependent control case is different from ( in fact , less than ) that in  @xcite .",
    "this is because the gain form proposed by theorem  3 in  @xcite is not used in our computation .",
    "one may also notice that the cost upper bound found in the case of @xmath221 is the same as the one in the case of @xmath220 .",
    "we now explain why this happens . in the case of @xmath221 ,",
    "each local controller obtains two subsystem modes directly .",
    "in fact , the third subsystem mode can be derived from these two modes based on possible mode combinations in @xmath39 .",
    "hence @xmath221 and @xmath220 are equivalent , in the sense that they yield the same performance .",
    "this example demonstrates that the system achieves better ( or at least equal ) performance if more information about the subsystem modes is available to the local controllers .",
    "it also shows that sometimes complete information about the global mode of the large - scale system may be redundant .",
    "this paper has presented a decentralized control scheme for uncertain markovian jump large - scale systems .",
    "the proposed controllers use local subsystem states and neighboring mode information to generate local control inputs . a computational algorithm involving rank",
