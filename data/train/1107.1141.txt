    "as a gas is cooled down towards micro - kelvin temperatures , the quantum nature of the interactions begins to dominate . with increasing de broglie wavelength ,",
    "the long - range tail of the potential plays a vital role in determining the nature of the interactions . in particular whether the elastic pair - wise interaction is , in the limit of zero temperature , attractive or repulsive  @xcite .",
    "the lower the incident energy of the ion - atom pair , the larger the distances for which these potentials influence the phase shift .",
    "this is critical in terms of the ultracold regime as to whether cooling , trapping and degeneracy can occur .",
    "it is extremely important in view of potential applications in exploring the fundamental process of ultracold charge transfer  @xcite .",
    "interest has developed in expanding the range of quantum systems that can be trapped and manipulated on the quantum scale .",
    "hybrid ion - atom systems are of great interest  @xcite since these are inherently strongly - interacting systems with a longer - range potential , and inelastic processes can be studied .",
    "recently these systems have been explored considering two - body collisions , in which both collision partners are translationally cold  @xcite , and on the many - body level  @xcite , where the sympathetic cooling of the ion with ultracold atoms was observed .",
    "the study of these systems in the quantum regime can be applied to hybrid atom - ion devices  @xcite and , in addressing fundamental many - body effects of ionic impurities such as mesoscopic molecule formation  @xcite and density fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "these devices also afford a unique opportunity to study reactive collisions ( ultracold chemistry ) under controlled conditions , for example when external electric fields can be applied to modify the reaction rates / cross sections  @xcite . unlike binary cold collisions between ground state neutral atoms , which are only elastic or inelastic in nature , reactive collisions ( charge transfer )",
    "are a feature of yb ions immersed in a gas of trapped alkali atoms as the products yb + rb@xmath2 are the thermodynamically favored species .",
    "consequently , curve crossings between electronic states , again absent in the neutral systems studied to date , can play a significant role in determining the collision dynamics .",
    "ultracold neutral atom interactions are characterized by pure @xmath3-wave scattering mediated at long - range by the dispersion forces @xcite .",
    "conversely , a bare ion creates a polarization force directly and hence the effective cross section is larger with significant contributions from higher - order partial waves  @xcite .",
    "indeed the usual effective range expansion is modified by logarithmic terms in the wavenumber expansion  @xcite .",
    "in the last few years theoretical studies of ultracold atom - ion collisions included the investigation of the occurrence of magnetic feshbach resonances with a view to examining the tunability of the atom - ion interaction focusing on the specific @xmath4 system  @xcite , and calculations of the single - channel scattering properties of the ba@xmath0 ion with the rb neutral atom  @xcite which suggest the possibility of sympathetic cooling of the barium ion by the buffer gas of ultracold rubidium atoms with a considerable efficiency .    in recent experiments  @xcite , a single trapped ion of @xmath5yb@xmath0 in a paul trap was immersed in a condensate of neutral @xmath6rb atoms confined in a magneto - optical trap .",
    "a study of charge transfer cross sections showed that the simple classical langevin model was inadequate to explain the reaction rates  @xcite .",
    "however , very little is known about the microscopic ultracold binary interactions between this ion and the rubidium atom . in particular",
    ", the potential energy curves and couplings are not known with any accuracy .",
    "thus the experimental study of the quantum coherence of charge transfer  @xcite was based on schematics of the energy curves .",
    "this prompted our in depth investigations .",
    "our initial aim was to map the potential energy curves to establish the adiabatic states and the static properties of the molecular ion , in particular the turning points , potential minima , and crossing points of the lowest molecular energies .",
    "in addition to this , the dissociation energies and molecular constants would provide useful spectroscopic data for further investigation .",
    "we have made a preliminary estimation of the pseudopotential which approximates the ultracold interaction .",
    "this information is of great importance for modeling ultracold charge transfer , and in particular the quantum character of chemical reactivity and thus develop insights into ultracold quantum controlled chemistry , for example when external fields are applied to influence the reaction rates and reaction channels  @xcite .",
    "of course , the presence of a bare charge in a dilute gas exposes many - body physics features such as exciton and polariton dynamics , which are also of great interest .",
    "it is also of great interest for laser manipulation of the collision to prevent losses through charge transfer or create translationally - cold trapped molecular ions via photoassociation .",
    "beyond the calculation of ionization potentials and dissociation energies , one of the more challenging tasks for a quantum chemistry package is the calculation of polarizabilities and dispersion forces .",
    "since these terms dominate at asymptotic long - range and low energies , their accuracy is paramount in obtaining a solid foundation for scattering calculations @xcite . in atomic units ,",
    "the asymptotic singly - charged ion - atom potential has the form  @xcite @xmath7 , \\label{mult}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the dipole polarizability of the neutral atom and where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are respectively the quadrupole and octupole polarizabilities , and @xmath11 is the asymptotic limit ( ionization potential ) .",
    "@xmath12 is the ion - atom internuclear separation . of course",
    ", the ionization potential and the other coefficients will depend on the electronic configuration and thus on the electronic state in question .",
    "the primary interest , for cold atom physics , is the ground - state .",
    "however , for temperatures in the mk regime , the excited states have an important role in energy exchanges through collisions .",
    "a recent review of existing theoretical methods for ground - state polarizability discusses their relevance to cold - atom physics  @xcite .",
    "calculations of polarizability for molecules with heavy atoms , even restricting interest to the ground state , become increasingly difficult , partly because of relativistic corrections . however , as is the case of rb , electron correlation is in practice more problematic .",
    "for example , a basic non - relativistic hartree - fock calculation @xcite gives @xmath13 ( atomic units ) .",
    "it requires the power of the coupled - cluster expansions to account fully for correlation .",
    "the ccsd(t ) method gives @xcite @xmath14(a.u . )",
    "( non - relativistic ) , while relativistic corrections take the value to , @xmath15(a.u . ) . at this point ,",
    "the theory is consistent with experiment : @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "however , excited state calculations are more problematic .",
    "in our approach we employed the molpro  @xcite suite of _ ab initio _ quantum chemistry codes ( release molpro 2010.1 ) to perform all the calculations for this diatomic system ( rb , yb)@xmath0 to obtain the potential energy curves ( pec s ) as a function of bond length .",
    "we used a combination of multi - reference configuration interaction ( mrci ) and full configuration interaction ( fci ) approximations .",
    "the _ ab initio _ potential energy curves for this diatomic system are calculated using effective core potentials ( ecp ) as a basis set for each atom , which allows for scalar - relativistic effects to be included explicitly .",
    "the scalar - relativistic effects are included by adding the corresponding terms of the douglas - kroll hamiltonian to the one - electron integrals .",
    "for the short - range interactions for the molecular electronic states we used the non - relativistic complete - active - space self consistent field ( casscf)/mrci method  @xcite within the molpro  @xcite _ ab initio _ quantum chemistry suite of codes .",
    "we used the stuttgart basis sets and effective core potentials ( ecp s ) with core - polarization potentials ( cpp ) for rb and yb , respectively the ecp68mdf potential for yb , and the ecp36sdf potential for rb .",
    "the inner shell electrons are modeled using these effective core potentials ( ecp68mdf ) for ytterbium  @xcite , and ( ecp36sdf ) for rubidium  @xcite .",
    "we started at a bond separation of @xmath17 @xmath18 and moved in to @xmath19 @xmath18 . at @xmath20 @xmath18",
    ", we perform a self - consistent field hartree - fock scf - hf calculation on the closed - shell ybrb molecular ion system to obtain a starting wave function .",
    "this is the starting configuration for the multireference configuration - interaction mrci calculation performed in the appropriate molecular symmetry group .",
    "we used an active space of \\{6a@xmath21 , 3b@xmath21 , 3b@xmath22 , 0a@xmath22 } in the c@xmath23 abelian point group with no closed orbitals .",
    "we then perform a multi - configuration self - consistent field calculation mcscf . the multi - configuration self - consistent field ( mcscf )",
    "calculation was performed on the lowest five electronic states .",
    "these results were used as the initial wavefunction set for a multi - reference configuration interaction ( mrci ) calculation to capture the dynamic electron correlation .",
    "only the valence shells were included in the determination of the electronic correlation energy . as a test of the basis set employed",
    ", we conducted equivalent calculations on the neutral ybrb molecule yielding values as expected consistent with those of meyer and bohn  @xcite .     as a function of internuclear distance , @xmath12 , ( mrci approximation ) .",
    "the @xmath24 ground state is the rb@xmath2 channel , while the lowest energy ionic ytterbium states , the triplet @xmath25 and singlet @xmath26 pair , are nearly degenerate with the excited charge - transfer channels : @xmath27.,scaledwidth=52.5% ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab5 ]",
    "we have investigated the electronic structure of low lying states of the diatomic molecular ionic system containing a ytterbium ion and a rubidium atom , with relevance to ultracold chemistry , in particular , charge transfer processes involving yb ions and rb atoms .",
    "we employed both a multi - reference configuration interaction ( mrci ) and a full configuration interaction ( fci ) approach to obtain turning points , crossing points , potential minima and spectroscopic molecular constants for the lowest five molecular states .",
    "long - range parameters , including the dispersion coefficients are estimated from our _ ab initio _ data .",
    "we find a near degeneracy of the yb@xmath2 ground state with excited charge transfer channels .",
    "the results for the long - range potential tail including the polarizability are seen to be in suitable agreement with previous experimental and theoretical work .",
    "we present preliminary results for the ultracold elastic scattering amplitude for the ytterbium ion colliding with the rubidium atom , based on our _ ab initio _ data including both asymptotic ionic channels .",
    "these estimates , assuming pure adiabatic elastic scattering , indicate that the yb@xmath2 ion collisions with rb atom interactions are attractive for both the singlet and triplet states .",
    "effective range theory is used to derive the corresponding pseudopotential which has a strong energy dependence , even in the nk rgime not well represented by the single - parameter scattering length .",
    "the well - known sensitivity of scattering length to changes in the potential indicates that our estimates , although ( to our knowledge ) the first of their kind , are rather crude . nonetheless , the potential energy curves are accurate in the region where charge exchange is important and thus offer prospects of studying this process under quantum controlled conditions .",
