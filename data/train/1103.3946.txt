    "[ tb : sam ] , the mean photon index of fr is and friis are 2.27 and 2.58 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the fri population tends to have harder spectra than the frii population as shown in @xcite .",
    "this trend is also same as that between bl lacs and fsrqs @xcite .",
    "this result would support that fris and friis are the misaligned population of bl lacs and fsrqs .",
    "it is also important to compare the cosmological evolutions of blazars and radio galaxies based on the recent _ fermi _ data .",

    "this is because redshifts of about a half of bl lac samples has not yet determined @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite treated blazars as one population using blazar sequence @xcite .",
    "blazar glf models which divide fsrqs and bl lacs is required such as @xcite to interpret the unification scenario . since our model in this paper",
    "also does not treat fri and frii separately because of small samples , glf models of gamma - ray loud radio galaxies dividing these two population are also required .    therefore , redshift information of all blazars and more data of gamma - ray loud radio galaxies would be required to make a comparison of the cosmological evolutions of blazars and radio galaxies .",
    "in this paper , we studied the contribution of gamma - ray loud radio galaxies to the egrb by constructing their glf .",
    "first , we explored the correlation between the radio and gamma - ray luminosities of gamma - ray loud radio galaxies which are recently reported by _",
    "fermi _ @xcite .",
    "we found that there is a correlation @xmath170 by a partial correlation analysis , where @xmath134 is the 0.1 - 10 gev gamma - ray luminosity and @xmath0 is the radio luminosity at 5 ghz .",
    "this slope index is similar to that of blazars .",
    "based on this correlation , we defined the glf of gamma - ray loud radio galaxies using the rlf of radio galaxies .",
    "we normalized the glf to fit to the cumulative flux distribution of _ fermi _ samples by using _",
    "_ detection efficiency @xcite .",
    "then , we predicted the contribution of gamma - ray loud radio galaxies to the mev and gev egrb . the absorption by ebl and the reprocessed cascade emission are also taken into account .",
    "we found that gamma - ray loud radio galaxies will explain @xmath3% of the egrb flux above 100 mev and also make a significant contribution to the 130 mev egrb . since blazars explain @xmath10% of egrb , we are able to explain @xmath4% of egrb by blazars and gamma - ray loud radio galaxies .",
    "we also make an interpretation on the origin of the egrb above 10 gev from the point of view of the ebl absorption effect .",
    "since the ebl absorption signature is still not appeared in the egrb spectrum , the origin would be nearby sources or sources with hard gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "we should await the egrb data at higher energy band for this issue .",
