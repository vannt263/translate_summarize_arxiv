    "in our previous work @xcite , we investigated the transitions between heavy baryons @xmath10 by assuming the baryonic heavy - quark - light - diquark structures in terms of the light - front - quark model ( lfqm ) .",
    "the results are reasonably consistent with the available data , so it implies that the whole scenario is realistic in that case , however still needs more studies on its validity in other cases . as noticed that the ground state diquarks in @xmath11 and @xmath12 are color - anti - triplet scalars . in this work",
    ", we continue to consider the transitions of @xmath13 because the ground state diquark in @xmath14 is an axial vector .",
    "we explore if the difference of the diquark identities would result in distinct behaviors for the transitions and then by comparing with data we are able to gain more insight about the diquark structure .",
    "thanks to the successful operation of lhc , a remarkable database on baryons , especially on the heavy baryons will be available at lhcb .",
    "it enables researchers to closely study the properties of heavy baryons at their production and decay processes .",
    "since the situation is confronting a radical change , more physicists are turning to concern baryons and look for hints of new physics .",
    "for example , as the decay @xmath15 was observed@xcite the authors of ref.@xcite studied contribution from new physics candidates by analyzing the data . however , as it is well known when one explores possible new physics scenario based on the data , he needs to fully understand the contribution of the standard model ( sm ) i.e. before attributing the phenomena to new physics a complete analysis on the sm contribution is necessary .    in this work",
    "we explore the weak transition of @xmath16 .",
    "the dominant strong decay mode @xmath17 determines the lifetime of @xmath18 , thus the weak decays of @xmath18 are rare .",
    "however , from another aspect , the rare decays of @xmath18 may be more sensitive to new physics , so that it is worth a careful study . supposing the factorization is valid , the transition between quarks would be fully described by the perturbative theory and calculable , thus the main task for studying @xmath16 is to deal with the hadronic transition matrix element .",
    "the hadronic matrix elements are determined by non - perturbative qcd and are generally parameterized by some form factors which can be reduced into a few equivalent isgur - wise functions under the heavy quark limit@xcite .",
    "some authors @xcite calculated the form factors of the transition @xmath19 in various approaches .",
    "the quark - diquark structure that heavy baryons are made of a heavy quark and a light diquark@xcite is generally considered as a reasonable physics picture for heavy baryons . with the quark - diquark structure",
    "the authors of refs.@xcite evaluated the transition rates between heavy baryons and their results are consistent with the available data .",
    "it is noted that the diquark stands as a spectator in the transition of @xmath16 , so that under the heavy quark limit , the spin of light diquark decouples and we may evaluate the rates of the corresponding rare decays in terms of the isgur - wise functions .",
    "a general analysis suggests that there exist many isgur - wise - type functions for a transition between baryons @xcite and usually it would be hard to determine them by fitting data .",
    "however , with the quark - diquark structure , the number of such functions for the transition @xmath13 reduces into only two .",
    "the light - front quark model ( lfqm ) is a relativistic quark model which has been applied to study transitions among mesons and the results agree with the data within reasonable error tolerance @xcite , thus we would be tempted to extend its application to calculate the transition of @xmath16 as long as the diquark picture is employed . in ref.@xcite we calculated the transition of @xmath20 in terms of lfqm . in that work",
    "we first constructed the vertex function of @xmath21 and then deduced the form factors for the transition .",
    "however the formulas in @xcite do not apply to the decay @xmath16 because the diquark in @xmath21 is a scalar of color - anti - triplet , but that in @xmath14 is an axial vector as discussed in refs.@xcite .",
    "thus we need to re - construct the vertex function for a @xmath22 heavy baryon which is regarded as a bound state of a heavy quark and a light axial vector diquark .",
    "then with the vertex functions of baryons we would derive the transition matrix element which are parametrized by a few form factors , and under the heavy quark limit , we will show that the transition matrix element of @xmath13 can be described by two generalized isgur - wise functions .",
    "numerically the results obtained in the two approaches are rather close , so it implies that the employed approaches are reasonably consistent with the physical picture .",
    "since the leptons do not participate in the strong interaction , the semileptonic decay is simple and less contaminated by the non - perturbative qcd effect , therefore study on semileptonic decay might help to test the employed model and/or constrain the model parameters . with the form factors we evaluate the width of the semileptonic decay . comparing our numerical result with data",
    "the model parameters which are hidden in the vertex functions can be fixed .",
    "moreover , the amplitude of the non - leptonic decay @xmath23 can also be evaluated in a similar way as long as we suppose that the meson current can be factorized out .",
    "moreover , we further investigate the transitions of @xmath24 by assuming the flavor su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "since @xmath9 does not decay via strong interaction , the weak decays are dominant , so that study on such modes has an obvious advantage .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : after the introduction , in section ii we construct the vertex functions of heavy baryons , then derive the form factors for the transition @xmath19 in the light - front quark model , then we present our numerical results for the transition @xmath19 along with all necessary input parameters in section iii , then we also evaluate the transition of @xmath24 .",
    "section iv is devoted to our conclusion and discussions .",
    "by the quark - diquark structure@xcite , the heavy baryon @xmath14 consists of a light @xmath25 diquark [ ud ] and one heavy quark @xmath26 . to insure the quantum number of @xmath14 , the orbital angular momentum between the two components is zero , i.e. @xmath27 .      in analog to our previous work @xcite",
    ", we construct the vertex function of @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) where the diquark is an axial vector in the same model .",

    "in this paper , we extensively explore the @xmath13 transition in all details and estimate the widths for the semi - leptonic decay and non - leptonic two - body decays of @xmath100 as well as several relevant measurable quantities . for the heavy baryons the quark - diquark picture",
    "is employed , which reduces the three - body structure into a two - body one .",
    "the matrix elements of the transition @xmath13 can be parameterized with a few form factors @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) according to the lorentz structures , and we obtain these form factors by calculating the transition @xmath13 in the lfqm and evaluate them numerically . the form factors @xmath104 and @xmath105 for @xmath13 are much larger than @xmath106 and @xmath107 , it is noted that @xmath108 and @xmath109 have opposite signs . furthermore , we also derive the generalized isgur - wise functions @xmath84 and @xmath85 under the heavy quark limit .",
    "we find that @xmath110 is consistent with the normalization condition , but @xmath111 is slightly lower than 1/2 which was predicted by large @xmath112 theory .",
    "our analysis indicates that the deviation is due to the non - zero mass of the light constituents in hadrons ( meson and baryon ) . with the form factors derived in terms of the lfqm or the isgur - wise functions we evaluate the semi - leptonic decay rates of @xmath13 with and without taking the heavy quark limit .",
    "the results with and without heavy quark limit do not decline much from each other , moreover , our numerical results of the rates are generally consistent with that estimated by different approaches . however , it is interesting to note that for the transverse polarization asymmetry @xmath113 , there is an obvious discrepancy between our results and those by other approaches .",
    "moreover , in terms of su(3 ) symmetry of light quarks we estimate the rates @xmath8 which is approximately equal to those of @xmath13 .    since the lhcb is running successfully and a remarkable amount of data on @xmath18 and @xmath9 production and decay is being accumulated , especially by the lhcb detector , thus we have all confidence that in near future ( maybe not next year , but anyhow wo nt be too far away ) , their decay rates and even the asymmetries would be more accurately measured , and we will have a great opportunity to testify our models .    now let us estimate the feasibility of observing the decay process @xmath114 .",
    "firstly , we use the code pythia8.1 to calculate the production cross section of @xmath115 via @xmath116 . by the pythia8.1@xcite ,",
    "100000 @xmath117 pairs are generated at the @xmath118 . then @xmath119 are produced and the corresponding production cross section is @xmath120 . in 2011 , the integrated luminosity of the lhcb is @xmath121@xcite and the production cross section of the @xmath117 pairs is @xmath122@xcite , so our estimate is that about @xmath123 @xmath115 exist in the 2011 data .    because the lhcb detector is good at tracking the charged particles , such as @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 and charged leptons",
    ", we suggest the decay chain used to find the @xmath18 s semileptonic decay is that : @xmath127 , @xmath128 ( the branching ratio is @xmath129 ) and @xmath130 ( the branching ratio is @xmath131 ) .",
    "so , the measurable number of this decay chain is : @xmath132 where , @xmath133 stands for the branching ratio of @xmath18 s semi - leptonic decay , the @xmath134 is the efficiency of the detection trigger and @xmath135 is the efficiency of the detector s geometric acceptance@xcite . without losing generality , we set @xmath136 here ( also given in @xcite ) .",
    "the decay width of @xmath18 is not known yet . since qcd is flavor - blind",
    ", thus we have reason to believe that considering the phase space of final state the decay width of the @xmath18 should be related to that of @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 as : @xmath140 substituting all these values back into eq.([num of sigma_b ] ) ( @xmath141 can be found in tab-[tab : t4 ] ) , we have the number of signals of @xmath142 : @xmath143 if the luminosity of lhcb is not increased greatly in the future to avoid the high level pile - up , we conclude that , since the strong decay @xmath144 dominates and the lifetime of @xmath18 is determined by the mode , the branching ratio of the weak decay is significantly suppressed , it would be hard to directly observe the signals of semileptonic decays of @xmath18 . since the signal of the semileptonic decays of @xmath18 is clear and related to new physics , so that is worth careful investigation at lhcb , even though it is almost impossible to be measured for the present luminosity if only sm applies .",
    "thus , as analyzed above , we would recommend to measure @xmath8 transitions because @xmath9 does not decay via strong interaction , so @xmath145 and @xmath146 would be the dominant modes .",
    "it enables us to make a more precise measurement by which we can not only further investigate the validity of the diquark picture for heavy baryons , but also create an opportunity to search for new physics beyond the sm , at least check if the new physics scenario shows up in such transitions .",
    "we also suggest to measure the quantities such as the asymmetries besides the widths , because of the obvious advantages about our models and physics .",

    "<S> the successful operation of lhc provides a great opportunity to study the processes where heavy baryons are involved . in this work we mainly study the weak transitions of @xmath0 . assuming the reasonable quark - diquark structure where the two light quarks constitute an axial vector </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the widths of semi - leptonic decay @xmath1 and non - leptonic decay modes @xmath2 ( light mesons ) in terms of the light front quark model . </S>",
    "<S> we first construct the vertex function for the concerned baryons and then deduce the form factors which are related to two isgur - wise functions for the @xmath3 transition under the heavy quark limit . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results indicate that @xmath4 is about @xmath5 and @xmath6 is slightly below @xmath7 which may be accessed at the lhcb detector . by the flavor su(3 ) </S>",
    "<S> symmetry we estimate the rates of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest to measure weak decays of @xmath8 , because @xmath9 does not decay via strong interaction , the advantage is obvious . </S>"
