    "[ intro ]    the graph of triangulations of a finite point set @xmath0 has as vertices all the triangulations of @xmath1 and as edges certain natural local modifications of them , analogous to the bistellar flips considered in combinatorial topology @xcite . see the precise definition in section [ sec.prelim ] .",
    "this graph is interesting in several contexts : in geometric combinatorics , its study is a special case of the generalized baues problem , which includes monotone paths on polytopes , zonotopal tilings , or the extension space of realizable oriented matroids as other cases .",
    "see the survey @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "in computational geometry , triangulations are a standard tool and flips have been often proposed as a method to explore the space of all possible triangulations or search for optimal ones ( e.g. , the delaunay one ) .",
    "see @xcite or the survey @xcite . in algebraic geometry , lattice polytopes and triangulations of them",
    "are closely related to toric varieties  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the graph of triangulations of a point set @xmath1 is connected if and only if the chow variety @xcite of @xmath1 is connected ( see corollary 4.9 in @xcite ) . the same question for the _ toric hilbert scheme _ @xcite of the point set is not clear .",
    "even though sturmfels and haiman @xcite have recently constructed a natural morphism from the toric hilbert scheme to the toric chow variety , this morphism is in general not surjective . in particular",
    ", it remained open until the present construction whether non - connected toric hilbert schemes existed .",
    "the solution we present here uses the result , due to maclagan and thomas @xcite , that at least the subgraph induced by unimodular triangulations of @xmath1 has a faithful relation to the toric hilbert scheme .",
    "see section [ sub.hilbert ] .",
    "more details on these interrelations can also be found in @xcite , where we constructed the first example of a point set whose graph of triangulations is not connected , in dimension 6 with 324 points . here",
    "we show much smaller examples .",
    "the essential new idea is that we construct triangulations with sub - structures which can not be destroyed by flips , rather than triangulations without flips .",
    "this gives more flexibility to the construction , and it also saves us several technicalities in the proofs . the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec.subcomplexes ] we give the precise definition of the graph of triangulations and the main ingredients needed to prove that the graph is not connected in our examples , summarized in theorem [ thm.map ] and its corollary [ coro.map ] .",
    "this section describes also the connection between the graph of triangulations and the toric hilbert scheme .",
    "the other two sections describe our two point sets @xmath2 and @xmath3 and prove that their graphs of triangulations and their toric hilbert schemes are not connected .",
    "these point sets have 50 and 26 points respectively , both in dimension 5 .",
    "the reason why we include both , and not only the smaller one , is that @xmath2 is simpler to describe and it has stronger properties which make it easier to prove what we need .",
    "more precisely , @xmath4 where @xmath1 and @xmath5 are , respectively , the set of vertices and the centroid of the regular 24-cell in @xmath6 .",
    "the point set @xmath3 is related to the regular cross - polytope , but not in such a direct way .",
    "our main results ( theorem [ thm.24cell ] , theorem [ thm.26points ] and propositions [ prop.50convex ] and [ prop.26convex ] ) can be summarized as :    [ thm.main ] the 5-dimensional point sets @xmath3 and @xmath2 , with 26 and 50 points respectively , have the following properties :    1 .",
    "their graphs of triangulations are not connected .",
    "their toric hilbert schemes are not connected ( for @xmath3 , the scheme is considered with respect to a non - homogeneous grading ) .",
    "the graphs of triangulations remain non - connected under suitable perturbations of the point sets into convex position . in particular , there is a 5-dimensional polytope with 26 vertices whose graph of triangulations is not connected .    concerning part ( 3 ) , a lifting construction mentioned in @xcite already allowed us to obtain polytopes with a non - connected space of triangulation , but only after a drastic explosion to dimension 234 .    thanks to symmetries ,",
    "we can even be more precise : the graphs of triangulations ( and the toric hilbert schemes ) of @xmath3 and @xmath2 have at least 17 and 13 connected components respectively .",
    "in @xmath2 , each of these 13 components contains at least @xmath7 unimodular triangulations .",
    "the corresponding connected components in the toric hilbert scheme have dimension at least 96 , in contrast to the fact that the coherent irreducible component has dimension @xmath8 ( corollary [ coro.quantitative ] ) .",
    "the point set @xmath2 has an additional feature : it equals the set of lattice points in a lattice polytope @xmath9 .",
    "point sets of this type play an even more important role in toric geometry than general lattice point sets . actually , because the construction of @xcite did not have this property the following assertion of v. alexeev ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , question 6 ) was not completely true :  a recent example of f. santos shows that the moduli space @xmath10 is in general not connected , where @xmath9 is a lattice polytope \" .",
    "the assertion is true , however , for the polytope @xmath11 :    [ thm : alexeev ] the moduli space of all stable semiabelic toric pairs of type bounded by the product @xmath9 of a segment and a 24-cell ( w.r.t .",
    "the lattice generated by the vertex set of @xmath9 ) has at least 13 connected components , each of dimension at least 96 and each with at least @xmath7 torus fixed points .",
    "it follows from corollary 4.9 of @xcite and the discussion preceding it that the moduli space in the statement has the same number of connected components as the graph of triangulations of the set of lattice points in @xmath9 .",
    "the dimension bound follows the ideas detailed in the proof of corollary [ coro.quantitative ] for the toric hilbert scheme .",
    "there , we show that in any of the 13 connected components of the graph of triangulations of @xmath2 there are triangulations refining a certain subdivision @xmath12 whose only minimal non - simplicial cells are 48 different octahedra .",
    "we then argue on the state polytope of a certain @xmath2-graded ideal whose existence is guaranteed by our lemma [ lemma : unimodular ] .    for the present statement",
    "the situation is even simpler : theorem 2.13.3 in @xcite says that the _ generalized secondary polytope _ ( cf .",
    "* section 2.12 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4 ) ) of any subdivision of @xmath2 is the image of a certain stratum in the moduli space of the statement . for our subdivision @xmath12 ,",
    "the generalized secondary polytope is 96-dimensional and has @xmath7 vertices : it is a product of 48 triangles .",
    "it is even possible to obtain a lattice point set that _ simultaneously _ satisfies all the properties stated above .",
    "it is obtained from @xmath2 via the so - called _ reoriented lawrence construction _ introduced in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.4 ) . even if the present constructions improve considerably those in @xcite , they still leave open some of the problems mentioned there :    * can the graphs of triangulations be non - connected for point sets of _ dimensions 3 and 4 _ ?",
    "dimension 3 is specially important for computational geometry and engineering applications . in dimension 2 the graph of triangulations",
    "is easily proved to be connected .",
    "* can the graphs of triangulations be non - connected for point sets _ in general position _ ?",
    "general position ( i.e. , no @xmath13 points lie in an affine hyperplane ) is interesting in applied areas . also , a disconnected graph of triangulations for a point set in general position would imply that the refinement poset of subdivisions of either the whole point set or a proper subset of it is disconnected too .",
    "connectivity of this poset is still open .",
    "its study is sometimes referred to as the _ generalized baues problem _ for triangulations .",
    "see @xcite or the introduction to @xcite for more details .",
    "* can the graphs of triangulations be non - connected for _",

    "every minimal dependent subset @xmath14 can be divided in a unique way in two parts @xmath15 and @xmath16 whose convex hulls intersect .",

    "then , we can obtain a new triangulation @xmath26 of @xmath1 replacing the sub - complex @xmath24 of @xmath20 by the complex @xmath27 .",
    "this operation is called a _ geometric bistellar operation _ or _ geometric bistellar flip _ ( or a _ flip _ , for short ) supported on the circuit @xmath17 .",

    "the following arguments will help convince the reader that it is the right concept of minimal or elementary change between triangulations :    1 .",
    "there is a certain subset of all triangulations of @xmath1 , called _ regular _ or _ coherent _ , which are in bijection with the vertex set of a polytope of dimension @xmath28 ( the _ secondary polytope _ of @xmath1 ) .",

    "two triangulations of @xmath35 differ by a bistellar flip if and only if the corresponding orderings differ by a transposition of a pair of consecutive elements .",
    "in particular , we get the following result , where a _ locally acyclic orientation _ of the 1-skeleton of a simplicial complex is an orientation of all its edges which is acyclic on every simplex .    [ prop.locallyacyclic ] the triangulations of @xmath32 which can be obtained by refining the product @xmath31 are in bijection with the locally acyclic orientations of the 1-skeleton of @xmath20 .",
