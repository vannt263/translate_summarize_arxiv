    "the anomalous suppression of the @xmath6 production in heavy ion collisions , which has been experimentally observed @xcite in the depletion of the dilepton multiplicity in the region of invariant mass corresponding to the @xmath6 meson , was proposed long time ago as a possibly unambiguous signal of the onset of deconfinement @xcite . indeed in ref .",
    "@xcite it is argued that charmonium states can only be produced in the first instants after the nucleus - nucleus collision , before the formation of a thermalized qgp .",
    "then , in their path through the deconfined medium , the original @xmath4 bound states tend to melt , since the binding ( colour ) coulomb potential is screened by the large number of colour charges .",
    "this , in turn , produces an anomalous ( with respect to normal nuclear absorption ) drop in the @xmath6 yields .    in this picture",
    "it is implicitly assumed that , once the charmonium dissociates , the heavy quarks hadronize by combining with light quarks only ( recombination leading to a secondary @xmath6 production is neglected )",
    ". this assumption is certainly justified at the sps conditions , due to the very small number of @xmath4 pairs produced per collision ( @xmath7 in a central collision ) , but at rhic ( @xmath8 ) and lhc ( @xmath9 ) energies it is no longer warranted @xcite .",
    "moreover in a hadronic collisions only about @xmath10 of the observed @xmath6 s are directly produced , the remaining stemming from the decays of excited charmonium states ( notably the @xmath11 and the @xmath12 ) . since each",
    "@xmath4 bound state dissociates at a different temperature , a model of _ sequential suppression _ was developed , with the aim of reproducing the @xmath6 suppression pattern as a function of the energy density reached in the heavy ion collision ( the highest temperatures and energy densities being reached in the most central collisions ) @xcite .",
    "sps experimental data for pb - pb collisions at different centralities seem indeed to support the dissociation pattern predicted by this model @xcite .",
    "alternative mechanisms for the @xmath6 production , like the statistical coalescence model ( scm ) , have also been proposed @xcite . in the scm",
    "one assumes again that all the @xmath4 pairs are produced in hard processes at the initial stage of the collision .",
    "any heavy quark bound state , if present , is assumed to melt in the qgp phase and the number of @xmath4 pairs in the fireball is considered fixed . at the chemical freeze - out open and hidden charmed hadrons are then produced with multiplicity _ ratios _ fixed by their masses , according to the laws of statistical mechanics . hence , in such a scheme , the measured @xmath6 multiplicity is not related to the presence of charmonium bound states in the plasma phase , but to the statistical hadronization of the initially produced @xmath13(@xmath14 ) ( anti-)quarks . this may lead , at lhc energies , to a completely different picture characterized by an enhanced charmonium production even if all the @xmath4 bound states dissociate during the plasma phase .    in any case",
    "the hypothesis that all the primary produced @xmath6 s melt during the qgp lifetime is hardly realized at sps conditions .",
    "hence models have been developed @xcite attempting to account both for the initial state production , eventually subject to in - medium dissociation , and for the thermal production at the hadronization .",
    "concerning the heavy quarkonia in the qgp phase , recent lattice data @xcite in quenched approximation ( hence neglecting effects arising from virtual processes involving dynamical fermions ) , which display narrow peaks for the charmonium spectral functions in the pseudoscalar and vector channels ( even up to @xmath15 ) , seem to point to the existence of heavy quark bound states up to temperatures above @xmath0 mesons . ] .",
    "clearly these results , if confirmed , would entail striking experimental consequences .",
    "actually , the meson spectral functions can not be measured directly on the lattice . from the numerical simulations one gets the current - current correlation function along the ( imaginary ) temporal direction on a finite number of points .",
    "such a correlator corresponds to the convolution of the meson spectral function with a thermal kernel .",
    "the spectral function can then be obtained only indirectly . with this aim in refs .",
    "@xcite a procedure called maximum entropy method ( mem ) has been adopted .",
    "clearly , an independent check of the results obtained with mem appears desirable .",
    "this indeed is our scope in the present paper .    for this purpose ,",
    "we first extract from lattice data a heavy quark potential accounting for thermal effects and then we solve the schrdinger equation for the charmonium ( and bottomonium ) . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , from the polyakov loop correlation function it is possible to extract the free energy ( in the different color channels ) of a heavy quark - antiquark pair placed at a distance @xmath16 in a thermal bath of gluons and light dynamical fermions .",
    "once a good parameterization of the color singlet free energy is obtained , the entropy and internal energy contributions can be disentangled . since the quarks acting as static sources of the color field are considered infinitely heavy , the internal energy coincides with the potential .",
    "the latter is then inserted into the schrdinger equation , from which the binding energy of the different stable states  if there are any  and their evolution with the temperature are obtained .",
    "indeed a clear distinction between the @xmath17 free and potential energies is necessary in order to get a reliable estimate of the quarkonium dissociation temperature @xmath18 in the different spin - parity channels .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the colour singlet _ free energy _ was directly inserted into the schrdinger equation , the dissociation temperatures @xmath19 @xcite and @xmath20 @xcite were found for the @xmath6 , all the other charmonium states melting well below @xmath0 .    on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a parameterization of the lattice color singlet _ potential _ ( in the quenched approximation ) was used , the temperature @xmath18 for the _ spontaneous dissociation _ of the @xmath6 was estimated to occur at about @xmath21 , a value even larger than the one obtained from the spectral analysis performed in refs .",
    "@xcite . also results for different charmonium and bottomonium states have been reported in ref .",
    "the case @xmath2 was addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath6 meson was found to be bound till @xmath22 .",
    "actually , even if the potential supports the existence of bound states , other physical processes may lead to the dissociation of the quarkonium .",
    "first , if the @xmath17 binding energy is lower than the temperature  and assuming that the quarkonia have reached the thermal equilibrium with the plasma  a certain fraction of their total number will be thermally excited to resonant states according to a bose - einstein distribution : such a process is referred to as _ thermal dissociation _ @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the collisions with the gluons and the light quarks of the plasma may lead to the _ collisional dissociation _ of the quarkonium . in this connection , the reaction @xmath23 was studied in detail in ref .",
    "hence , in spite of the presence of a bound state solution of the schrdinger equation till @xmath15 , the @xmath6 turned out to be really stable only up to temperatures lower than @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "clearly the two processes above mentioned are not encoded in the polyakov loop correlation function , where the heavy quarks act as unthermalized static sources of the color field , and have to be accounted for _ a posteriori_.    of course , if the process @xmath23 can lead to the dissociation of the charmonium , the same reaction can also occur in the opposite direction .",
    "hence a consistent calculation of @xmath6 multiplicity implies the solution of a kinetic rate equation integrated over the lifetime of the qgp phase in which both processes ( dissociation and recombination ) enter @xcite . to carry out this detailed balance calculation the knowledge of the @xmath6 binding energy and wave function in the thermal bath turns out to be an important input",
    "this is of relevance because , as mentioned above , the usual assumption in considering the @xmath6 suppression as a signature of deconfinement is that its production can occur only in the very initial stage of the collision .",
    "really , if at sps the role played by recombination is numerically negligible , this is no longer true at rhic as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in any case in this paper we limit ourselves to check the existence of bound state solutions of the schrdinger equation .",
    "a quantitative study of the dissociation and recombination processes is left for future work .    here",
    "we take advantage of all the available lattice data , obtained not only in quenched qcd ( @xmath1 ) , but also including two and , more recently , three light flavors .",
    "we are then in a position to study also the flavor dependence of the dissociation process , a perspective not yet achieved by the parallel studies of the spectral functions , which are , as already mentioned , only available in quenched qcd .",

    "the picture of the deconfined phase of qcd for values of the temperature slightly exceeding @xmath0  that is the ones accessible in the heavy - ion experiments presently performed at rhic  has substantially evolved in the last few years .    for large values of the temperature ( @xmath122 ) a description of the qgp in terms of a gas of weakly interacting quasiparticles",
    "@xcite appears reliable ( even in a regime where the coupling @xmath123 is not so weak ) and supported by the lattice data for the qgp thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for temperatures up to @xmath124 ( namely the ones currently accessible in the experiments ) , the matter resulting from the heavy - ion collisions is nowadays often described @xcite as a strongly interacting qgp ( sqgp ) . in particular , a striking feature of the qgp matter obtained at rhic is its hydrodynamical behaviour @xcite ( characterized by a very low viscosity ) , which manifests itself in particular in the elliptic flow @xcite observed in non - central collisions : the plasma obtained at rhic seems to behave as a nearly ideal fluid whose expansion is driven by pressure gradients .    in order to explain the very small mean free path of the plasma particles required by the hydrodynamical scenario , a picture of the matter obtained at rhic in terms of a system of hundreds of loosely bound states of _ quasiparticles _",
    "( @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 ... ) has been recently proposed @xcite . in such a framework",
    "one has to resort to some assumptions .",
    "gluons and light quarks are treated as quasiparticles endowed with quite heavy thermal masses obtained from lattice calculations and the potential felt by them in the different color channels is got from the lattice @xmath17 free energy under the hypothesis of _",
    "casimir scaling_.    the presence of such a pattern of bound states in the range of temperatures @xmath128 has been recently questioned on the basis of the analysis of the correlation between baryon number and strangeness @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of the correlation coefficient @xmath129 should allow to discriminate between a scenario in which the relevant degrees of freedom in the qgp are weakly interacting quark and gluon _ quasiparticles _ or loosely bound states of the latters .",
    "the lattice data on the off - diagonal quark - number susceptibilities available so far seem to favour the first hypothesis .",
    "here we followed a different approach , starting from the case of a heavy @xmath17 pair placed in a thermalized qgp and extracting their interaction from the available lattice calculations .",
    "indeed , we have exploited the lattice data for the heavy quark free energies to get information on the existence of @xmath4 and @xmath5 bound states above the deconfinement transition .",
    "we have examined the cases @xmath1 @xcite , @xmath2 @xcite and also @xmath3 @xcite , where lattice data are getting available . for the color singlet free energy we have adopted a parameterization which accounts for the effects of asymptotic freedom at short distances and displays an exponential screening at large distances . from the free energy we have then extracted the heavy quark potential , to be inserted into the schrdinger equation . the latter has been solved numerically for the two interesting cases of charmonium and bottomonium .    for what concerns the charmonium ,",
    "we have found a dissociation temperature @xmath88 for the 1s states ( @xmath96 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "also the excited states 1p and 2s appear to melt , but at temperatures slightly exceeding @xmath0 .    on the other hand , the bottomonium spectrum displays a much larger number of bound states above @xmath0 .",
    "in particular its ground state turns out to remain bound in the whole range of temperatures covered by our parameterization . by extrapolating the latter at larger @xmath55",
    "we get a dissociation temperature @xmath130 , depending upon the number of dynamical fermions . at fixed @xmath25 , both for the charmonium and for the bottomonium ,",
    "the system turns out to be more bound when the number of light flavors is increased .",
    "remarkably , in the range of temperatures of experimental interest covered in this paper a number of loosely bound @xmath17 states exists . since the existence of states near zero binding energy entails a huge increase of the elastic cross sections at low relative momenta , this can help the approach to thermal equilibrium also of the heavy quarks .",
    "an analogous situation occurs in the cross - over from the bcs theory of superconductivity to the bose - einstein condensation , much explored lately in ensembles of alkaline fermionic atoms confined in a magnetic trap .",
    "indeed , by smoothly changing the external magnetic field @xmath131 , one induces a smooth change of the energy of the two interacting atoms : if this energy is close to the one of a feshbach resonance , a huge increase in the cross - section occurs @xcite .",
    "the striking analogy between @xmath131 and @xmath55 as control parameters is self - imposing .    in connection with the previous discussion on heavy quark thermalization , it would be highly desirable to have lattice data also for the @xmath132 states , which are not yet available .",
    "a phenomenological model has been recently proposed assuming the existence of _ resonant _ ( not bound ) d- and b- meson states above @xmath0 @xcite . in this scheme",
    "the transverse momentum distributions of the charmed quarks ( anti - quarks ) would approach their thermal equilibrium value much faster , due to isotropic resonant scattering on light anti - quarks ( quarks ) .",
    "indeed , recent phenix results for azimuthally averaged transverse momentum spectra of single electrons arising , in au - au collisions , from the decay of d- and b - mesons seem to be compatible with a thermalization scenario @xcite .    furthermore , preliminary results from phenix and star on the elliptic flow of the above electrons tend to support a picture in which , due to strong rescattering , charmed quarks reach thermal equilibrium and follow the flow of the fireball @xcite . hence , an extension of the present approach to the @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) states might shed light on the mechanism of thermalization of the heavy quarks .    coming back to the present results , they offer the relevant possibility of evaluating the charmonium ( bottomonium ) multiplicity produced in heavy ion collisions at the experimental conditions of sps , rhic and lhc .    indeed ,",
    "a reliable estimate of the dissociation temperature of the different quarkonia is essential in order to predict how many of them , after being produced in the hard initial processes , survive in the qgp phase thus contributing to the final measured yields .",
    "the latter of course also contain , e.  g. , the charmonia that might be thermally produced during the hadronization process by @xmath4 recombination .",
    "in particular , the knowledge of the in - medium quarkonium wave function and binding energy would allow a hopefully reliable estimate of the gluon - dissociation cross section of the @xmath6 ( and hence , via a detailed balance analysis , also of the cross section for the inverse process ) .",
    "thus a kinetic rate equation accounting for both the dissociation and recombination processes can be tackled : its solution , depending on how many @xmath4 pairs are produced in the initial state , should provide the number of @xmath6 present at the end of the qgp phase .",
    "these issues will be addressed in future work .",
