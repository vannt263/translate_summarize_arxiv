    "the only condition is that the external potential obeys the periodicity relation , @xmath14 .",

    "this difference between @xmath86 and @xmath31 is due to correlations between the particles , which now couples the movement of the dipoles through the interaction potential .",

    "this effect of confinement brings the system into the single - file ( sf ) regime , which means that particles can not bypass each other @xcite .",
    "this special geometric constraint leads to a phenomenon called single - file diffusion ( sfd ) , in which one of the most striking feature is that the long - time mean - square displacement @xmath74 of a tagged particle along the unconfined direction ( in our case , the @xmath8 direction ) displays typical sub - diffusive motion with @xmath101 where @xmath4 is the so - called single - file diffusion mobility and @xmath102 is a characteristic relaxation time of the system .",

    "the analysis of the mean - square displacement @xmath1 showed that the system exhibits different regimes of diffusion depending on the external parameters ( i.e. external modulation , magnetic field ) that regulate the particle dynamics . in principle , this system could be realised experimentally using optical tweezer traps and our results could be verified by , e.g. , a microscopy imaging technique to track individual particles trajectories @xcite .",

    "the system turns into an effective `` artificial '' binary system , with the presence of a `` big '' particle formed by two dipoles in a potential well and a single particle in a neighbour potential well ; ( iii ) the presence of the external modulation affects the diffusion of the magnetic dipoles as compared to the case where there is no modulation ( cf .",
