    "galaxies are not distributed randomly across the sky . at least at low redshifts",
    ", they appear to trace distinct patterns : galaxy clusters are connected to each other by long , filamentary structures of galaxies , interspersed with large voids in which few or no galaxies are seen .",
    "a plausible theoretical motivation has arisen for the formation of such large - scale structures ( lss ) of galaxies , namely that the galaxies are tracing an underlying distribution of dark matter . in their most modern form",
    ", models for the formation of these large scale structures postulate that the evolution of the dark matter density field is inextricably linked to the formation and evolution of the galaxies themselves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these models generally invoke some variation of the biased hierarchical paradigm , in which overdensities , or ` halos ' , in the dark matter distribution undergo successive mergers over time to build halos of increasing mass , with galaxies forming from the baryonic matter in these halos .    from these models , and recent observations ,",
    "it is clear that the relationship between the properties of galaxies , and the properties of the dark matter halos in which they reside , is subtle , and is an area in which observational constraints are particularly valuable in constraining models .",
    "we would like to know , observationally , what sort of galaxy occupies what sort of halo as a function of redshift , and how the properties of galaxies change with both redshift and the masses of their parent halos .",
    "one method that has proven especially useful in providing such observational constraints is measuring clustering amplitudes .",
    "fundamentally , the biased hierarchical paradigm requires that overdensities of dark matter should themselves cluster together on the sky , with the strength of clustering depending on their mass @xcite . in principle",
    ", we can make great strides in understanding the relationship between galaxies and the underlying dark matter distribution by measuring the clustering strength of galaxies selected in a particular way , and relating this to theoretical predictions for halo clustering @xcite .",
    "such observations are , however , not straightforward to perform .",
    "reliable clustering measurements require large , homogeneous samples of sources selected over large enough areas of sky to sample a range of dark matter density regimes . ideally , we would like such observations to be performed in the near- and mid - infrared : the ( restframe ) near - infrard is most sensitive to evolved stars and so can pick up large samples of passively evolving systems , whereas the mid - infrared is sensitive to the dusty , active sources in which the stars and central black holes in ( at least some ) passively evolving systems are thought to form . infrared observatories available up to now , however , have not been capable of mapping large enough areas to the required depths to find sufficient numbers of sources , or in enough bands to even crudely discriminate between different populations .",
    "the launch of the _ spitzer _ space telescope @xcite offers the potential to overcome these problems , due to its ability to map large areas of sky in the infrared to greater depths than any previous observatory , and in multiple bands so that dusty , active systems can be differentiated from passively evolving systems .",
    "spitzer _ wide - area infrared extragalactic ( swire ) survey @xcite is the largest of the _ spitzer _ space telescope s six cycle  1 legacy programmes .",
    "the survey covers a total area of 49  square degrees , split between six fields , in all seven of _",

    "the area and depth of swire combine to produce a survey of significant comoving volume , 0.2@xmath12  gpc@xmath13 over @xmath14 , and spatial scales of @xmath15  mpc at @xmath16 .",
    "a principal goal of swire is to study the clustering behaviour of a variety of extragalactic populations . in @xcite",
    "we presented the first detection of galaxy clustering in the survey , measuring a two - point angular correlation function at 3.6  from our validation data , and in @xcite we presented results on the clustering of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) at @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite presented angular correlation functions at 3.68.0  from the 4-square degree _ spitzer _ first look survey .    in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis of the 3.6-  clustering to larger scales and fainter flux limits ( higher redshifts ) .",
    "we begin with a summary of definitions and formalisms in section  [ sec : defs ] , then in section  [ sec : sample ] we discuss the sample selection , including star / galaxy separation and the angular selection function . in section  [ sec : corrfunc ] we present our measurements of the two - point angular correlation function .",
    "we compare our results with previous measurements in the k - band ( section  [ sec : kband ] ) and with the galics semi - analytical simulations ( section  [ sec : galics ] ) .",
    "the angular clustering amplitudes are used to estimate the spatial correlation lengths , which are then compared with simple parameterized models of clustering evolution , the galics simulations and results from the literature ( section  [ sec : r0 ] ) .",

    "full details of the observations and data processing are given in @xcite ; here we summarize the essential details .",
    "the swire - en1 field was mapped by irac with a large grid of pointings , and at each grid point two 30-second images were taken , each one consisting of multiple dithered exposures .",
    "the entire grid was repeated in two epochs , offset by half an array width .",
    "thus , for any point on the sky there are a minimum of four independent sightings ( images ) , and these sightings occur on widely spaced parts of the detector array in order to minimize instrumental signatures .",
    "the entire survey has a minimum depth of four coverages , equal to 120  seconds of exposure time . in some areas",
    "this can be as high as sixteen coverages , or 480 seconds .",
    "the irac data were reduced and flux - calibrated by the _ spitzer _ science center .",
    "further processing of the individual images removed a number of effects ( mostly due to bright objects , primarily stars ) that remained in the pipeline products @xcite .",

    "sources were detected and their photometry measured with the sextractor package @xcite .",
    "we used the flux measured in a circular aperture of 38 diameter , unless the source was significantly extended , in which case we used the flux within the kron aperture .",
    "the source catalogue was a superset of the swire data release 2 @xcite , containing fainter objects than published at that time .",
    "we analyzed eleven flux - limited samples selected at 3.6  from the swire - en1 catalogue ( table  [ tab : amplitudes ] ) .",
    "the deepest sample contained sources with flux densities @xmath57  @xmath1jy(or @xmath58  mag ) , this limit being defined by the flux density at which the differential completeness is approximately 50 per cent .",
    "at this level , the integral completeness is 82 per cent ( see fig .",
    "[ intcomplete ] and discussion in section  [ sec : selection ] ) .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : lum ]    so far we have interpreted the change in @xmath30 as evolution in the clustering strength , but another possibility is that we are looking at different populations of sources in the different samples .",
    "for example , the fainter samples may be dominated by less massive galaxies which are located in halos of lower mass and so are intrinsically less clustered ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have investigated this possibility using the 3.6-  luminosity ( @xmath66 ) as a proxy for stellar mass . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lumdist ] we plot the luminosity distributions of each sample from the @xcite and @xcite models , showing the contribution from early - type ( elliptical / lenticular ) and late - type ( spiral , irregular , starburst ) populations separately . for 3.6-  luminosities below @xmath67  l@xmath68",
    ", the two models predict very similar distributions for the total counts , but at higher luminosities the @xcite models have an extended tail of luminous late - type galaxies that are not present in the @xcite models . at bright flux limits ( @xmath69  @xmath1jy ) , the late - types are about 3040 per cent of the total number of galaxies .",
    "the fraction of late - types then increases with decreasing flux limit , until in the faintest sample the late - types are 50  per cent of the total according to the @xcite model and 75  per cent of the total in the @xcite model . in all cases , the redshift distributions of the early - type galaxies",
    "are weighted towards higher redshifts than those of the late - type galaxies .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : r0lum ] we plot the spatial correlation lengths against the average 3.6-  luminosities for the two models , and tabulate the luminosities in tab .  [",
    "tab : lum ] . for the brightest samples ,",
    "i.e.  the lowest median redshifts , the average luminosity is approximately constant , at @xmath70 . at fainter flux limits (",
    "@xmath71  @xmath1jy  and below ) , it is seen that there is a trend for @xmath30 to decrease with decreasing average luminosity .",
    "recalling that there is a progressively larger fraction of late - type galaxies as the flux limit decreases , both the decrease in average luminosity ( mass ) and the weaker clustering could be a consequence of the changing galaxy population ",
    "i.e.  an increase in the number of lower - mass late - type galaxies .",
    "however , with the data we have available we can not unambiguously disentangle evolution in the clustering strength from evolution in the relative populations of early - types and late - types .",

    "the symbol size is proportional to the median redshift of each sample .",
    "luminosity errors are the standard deviations of the luminosity distributions . ]    finally , we have compared the best estimates of the correlation lengths ( table  [ tab : amplitudes ] ) with values of @xmath30 from the literature .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : r0z ] where we plot @xmath30 as a function of redshift for our data , together with a variety of galaxy and agn correlation lengths , and several models , compiled by @xcite .",
    "the swire sources are the most clustered population of galaxies at @xmath73 , with only clusters of galaxies exceeding the correlation lengths of the swire samples .",
    "the solid lines are the halo models of @xcite which allow us to estimate the approximate masses of the halos that host the 3.6-  selected sources . at @xmath74",
    "the inferred halo masses are approximately constant with redshift with @xmath75 .",
    "the correlation lengths have been shown above to decrease with increasing redshift beyond @xmath76 and this corresponds to a decrease in halo mass from @xmath77  m@xmath68 to @xmath78  m@xmath68 at @xmath79 .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that we are detecting more late - type galaxies , which have lower masses than the early - types that are prevalent in the brighter samples .    , of our samples ( red circles ) as a function of redshift , compared with values from the literature ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "also shown are indicative @xmath33 models of clustering evolution : stable and linear models with @xmath80  mpc , corresponding to the average of our low-@xmath27 results ; and a linear model normalized to the dark matter clustering strength , @xmath81  mpc , of @xcite . ]",
    "the swire survey has allowed us to measure the angular clustering of sources selected at 3.6  over larger scales and with greater significance than previously has been possible .",
    "the two - point angular correlation function has been measured in eleven flux - limited samples down to @xmath82  @xmath1jy , corresponding to median redshifts @xmath83 .",
    "these angular results are in good agreement with the galics simulations and with @xmath84-band clustering measurements .",
    "we have used limber s equation to infer the spatial correlation lengths from the angular measurements and four estimates of the redshift distributions of each sample .",
    "we find that the systematic uncertainty in the @xmath48 distribution dominates the statistical errors , and adopt the photometric redshift distribution from impz as the best estimate of @xmath48 , extrapolating to higher redshifts using the galics results .",
    "the comoving correlation length varies slowly around @xmath8  mpc out to a median redshift of @xmath76 and then decreases with increasing redshift .",
    "if this change at higher redshifts is due to evolution in the clustering , then the required evolution is very strong ( with @xmath85  mpc and @xmath86 ) and these swire galaxies would be in environments that will evolve into massive clusters by the present day .",
    "there is some indication from the @xcite and @xcite phenomological models that the change in correlation length is due to a decrease in the average 3.6-  luminosity ( or equivalently , stellar mass ) of the fainter samples rather than evolution in the clustering .",
    "this decrease in average luminosity is the result of an increased fraction of late - type galaxies in the faint samples .",
    "comparing these swire data with the halo models of @xcite suggests that the fainter samples are selecting sources in lower mass halos .",
    "these latter two results provide a consistent picture where lower - mass late - type galaxies are preferentially found in lower mass halos and thus have weaker clustering .",
    "the comparison of our data with the galics simulations has shown that these models are a good match to the angular clustering , but their redshift distributions differ markedly from the phenomological models and the photometric redshift distributions .",
    "this highlights the need for a better understanding of the spatial clustering and its evolution .",
    "higher - resolution numerical models and improved semi - analytic models will allow us to directly explore the relation between the clustering of the galaxies and the dark matter , i.e.  the bias .",
    "for example , the dark matter millenium simulation @xcite has a lower mass resolution limit than galics , and combined with semi - analytic models of the galaxies it is a better match to the area and depth of swire than the current models .",
    "future work will explore the comparison between these models and the swire data presented here .",
