    "hilbert s program was launched , in 1922 , with the specific goal of demonstrating the consistency of modern , set - theoretic methods , using only finitary means .",
    "but the program can be viewed more broadly as a response to the radical methodological changes that had been introduced to mathematics in the late nineteenth century .",
    "central to these changes was a shift in mathematical thought whereby the goal of mathematics was no longer viewed as that of developing powerful methods of calculation , but , rather , that of characterizing abstract , possibly infinite , mathematical structures , often in ways that could not easily be reconciled with a computational understanding .",
    "grisha s work over the years has touched on almost every aspect of proof theory , both of the reductive ( foundational ) and structural sort , involving a wide range of logical frameworks . but",
    "much of his work addresses the core proof - theoretic concern just raised , and has served to provide us with a deep and satisfying understanding of the computational content of nonconstructive , infinitary reasoning .",
    "such work includes his characterization of the provably total computable functions of @xmath0 as exactly the primitive recursive functions ( @xcite ) ; his method of continuous cut elimination , which provides a finitary interpretation of infinitary cut - elimination methods ( @xcite ) ; and his work on the epsilon substitution method ( for example , @xcite ) .",
    "grisha has also been a friend and mentor to me throughout my career .",
    "the characterization of the provably total computable functions of @xmath0 just mentioned was , in fact , also discovered by charles parsons and gaisi takeuti , all independently .",
    "i shudder to recall that at a meeting at oberwolfach in 1998 , when i was just two - and - a - half years out of graduate school , i referred to the result as `` parsons theorem '' in a talk before an audience that , unfortunately , included only the other two .",
    "grisha asked the first question after the talk was over , and nothing in his manner or tone even hinted that i had made a _",
    "( it did nt even occur to me until much later ) .",
    "in fact , i still vividly remember his encouraging and insightful comments , then and in later discussion .",
    "( for the record , gaisi was equally gracious and supportive . )    in this essay , i will discuss methods of interpreting classical first - order arithmetic , often called _ peano arithmetic _",
    "( @xmath1 ) , in computational terms .",
    "although the study of @xmath1 was central to hilbert s program , it may initially seem like a toy theory , or an artificially simple case study .",
    "after all , mathematics deals with much more than the natural numbers , and there is a lot more to mathematical argumentation than the principle of induction .",
    "but experience has shown that the simplicity of the theory is deceptive : via direct interpretation or more elaborate forms of proof - theoretic reduction , vast portions of mathematical reasoning can be understood in terms of @xmath1 @xcite .    here",
    ", i will be concerned with the @xmath2 , or `` computational , '' consequences of @xmath1 .",
    "suppose @xmath1 proves @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 range over the natural numbers and @xmath6 is a decidable ( say , primitive recursive ) relation .",
    "we would like to understand how and to what extent such a proof provides an _ algorithm _ for producing such a @xmath5 from a given @xmath4 , one that is more informative than blind search .",
    "there are four methods that are commonly used to extract such an algorithm :    1 .",
    "gdel s _ dialectica _ interpretation @xcite , in conjunction with a double - negation interpretation that interprets @xmath1 in its intuitionistic counterpart , heyting arithmetic ( @xmath7 ) 2 .",
    "realizability @xcite , again in conjunction with a double - negation translation , and either the friedman @xmath8-translation @xcite ( often also attributed to dragalin and leivant , independently ) or a method due to coquand and hofmann ( @xcite ) to `` repair '' translated @xmath2 assertions 3 .",
    "cut elimination ( @xcite ; see , for example , @xcite ) 4 .",
    "the epsilon substitution method ( @xcite )    these four approaches really come in two pairs : the dialectica interpretation and realizability have much in common , and , indeed , paulo oliva @xcite has recently shown that one can interpolate a range of methods between the two ; and , similarly , cut elimination and the epsilon substitution method have a lot in common , as work by grisha ( e.g.  @xcite ) shows . that is not to say that there are nt significant differences between the methods in each pairing , but the differences between the two pairs are much more pronounced .",
    "for one thing , they produce two distinct sorts of `` algorithms . ''",
    "the dialectica interpretation , and kreisel s `` modified '' version of kleene s realizability , extract terms in gdel s calculus of primitive recursive functionals of finite type , denoted @xmath9 in section  [ preliminaries : section ] below .",
    "in contrast , cut elimination and the epsilon substitution method provide iterative procedures , whose termination can be proved by ordinal analysis . specifically , one assigns ( a notation for ) an ordinal less than @xmath10 to each stage of the computation in such a way that the ordinals decrease as the computation proceeds .",
    "terms in @xmath9 and @xmath11-recursive algorithms both have computational meaning , and there are various ways to `` see '' that the computations terminate ; but , of course , any means of proving termination formally for all such terms and algorithms has to go beyond the means of @xmath1 .",
    "second , as indicated above , the first two methods involve an intermediate translation to @xmath7 , while the second two do not .",
    "it is true that the dialectica interpretation and realizability can be applied to classical calculi directly ( see @xcite for the dialectica interpretation , and , for example , @xcite for realizability ) ; but i know of no such interpretation that can not be understood in terms of a passage through intuitionistic arithmetic @xcite .",
    "in contrast , cut elimination and the epsilon substitution method apply to classical logic directly .",
    "that is not to deny that one can apply cut elimination methods to intuitionistic logic ( see , for example , @xcite ) ; but the arguments tend to be easier and more natural in the classical setting .",
    "finally , there is the issue of canonicity .",
    "algorithms extracted from proofs in intuitionistic arithmetic tend to produce canonical witnesses to @xmath2 assertions ; work by grisha @xcite shows , for example , that algorithms extracted by various methods yield the same results .",
    "in contrast , different ways of extracting witnesses from classical proofs yield different results , conveying the impression that there is something `` nondeterministic '' about classical logic .",
    "( there is a very nice discussion of this in @xcite .",
    "see also the discussion in section  [ conclusions : section ] below . )",
    "insofar as one has a natural translation from classical arithmetic to intuitionistic arithmetic , some of the canonicity of the associated computation is transferred to the former theory .    in this essay",
    ", i will discuss realizability and the dialectica interpretation , as they apply to classical arithmetic , via translations to intuitionistic arithmetic .",
    "after reviewing some preliminaries in section  [ preliminaries : section ] , i will discuss variations of the double - negation interpretation in section  [ double : negation : section ] .",
    "one , in particular , is very efficient when it comes to introducing negations ; in section  [ realizability : section ] , i will show that , when combined with realizability or the dialectica interpretation , this yields computational interpretations of classical arithmetic that are efficient in their use of higher types . in section  [ herbrand : section",
    "] , i will consider another curious double - negation interpretation , and diagnose an unfortunate aspect of its behavior .",
    "this work has been partially supported by nsf grant dms-0700174 and a grant from the john templeton foundation .",
    "i am grateful to philipp gerhardy , thomas streicher , and an anonymous referee for helpful comments and corrections .",
    "somewhat imprecisely , one can think of intuitionistic logic as classical logic without the law of the excluded middle ; and one can think of minimal logic as intuitionistic logic without the rule _",
    "ex falso sequitur quodlibet _",
    ", that is , from @xmath12 conclude anything .",
    "computational interpretations of classical logic often pass through minimal logic , which has the nicest computational interpretation .",
    "( one can interpret intuitionistic logic in minimal logic by replacing every atomic formula @xmath8 by @xmath13 , so the difference between these two is small . )    to have a uniform basic to compare the different logics , it is useful to take the first - order logical symbols to be @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath12 , with @xmath19 defined to be @xmath20 .",
    "however , when it comes to classical logic , it is often natural to restrict one s attention to formulas in _ negation - normal form _ , where formulas are built up from atomic and negated atomic formulas using @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . a negation operator , @xmath21 , can be defined for such formulas ; @xmath21 is what you get if , in @xmath22 , you exchange @xmath16 with @xmath17 , @xmath14 with @xmath15 , and atomic formulas with their negations . note that @xmath23 is just @xmath22 .",
    "classically , every formula @xmath22 has a negation - normal form equivalent , @xmath24 , obtained by defining @xmath25 to be @xmath26 , and treating the other connectives in the obvious way .",
    "this has the slightly awkward consequence that @xmath27 translates to @xmath28 , but simplifying @xmath29 to @xmath30 and @xmath31 to @xmath12 easily remedies this .",
    "there are a number of reasons why negation - normal form is so natural for classical logic .",
    "first of all , it is easy to keep track of polarities : if @xmath22 is in negation - normal form , then every subformula is a positive subformula , except for , perhaps , atomic formulas ; an atomic formula @xmath8 occurs positively in @xmath22 if it occurs un - negated , and negatively if it occurs with a negation sign before it .",
    "second , the representation accords well with practice : any classically - minded mathematician would not hesitate to prove `` if @xmath22 then @xmath32 '' by assuming @xmath33 and deriving @xmath19 , or by assuming @xmath22 and @xmath33 and deriving a contradiction ; so it is convenient that @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 have the same negation - normal form representation .",
    "finally , proof systems for formulas in negation - normal form tend to be remarkably simple ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "it was gdel @xcite who first showed that the provably total computable functions of arithmetic can be characterized in terms of the primitive recursive functionals of finite type ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the set of finite types can be defined to be the smallest set containing the symbol @xmath37 , and closed under an operation which takes types @xmath38 and @xmath39 to a new type @xmath40 . in the intended ( `` full '' ) interpretation",
    ", @xmath37 denotes the set of natural numbers , and @xmath41 denotes the set of all functions from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "a set of terms , @xmath9 , is defined inductively as follows :    1 .   for each type @xmath38",
    ", there is a stock of variables @xmath42 of type @xmath38 .",
    "2 .   @xmath43 is a term of type @xmath37 .",
    "3 .   @xmath44 ( successor ) is a term of type @xmath45 .",
    "4 .   if @xmath46 is a term of type @xmath47 and @xmath48 is a term of type @xmath39 , then @xmath49 is a term of type @xmath38 .",
    "5 .   if @xmath46 is a term of type @xmath38 and @xmath4 is a variable of type @xmath39 , then @xmath50 is a term of type @xmath51 .",
    "if @xmath46 is a term of type @xmath38 , and @xmath48 is a term of type @xmath52 , then @xmath53 is a term of type @xmath54 .",
    "intuitively , @xmath49 denotes the result of applying @xmath46 to @xmath48 , @xmath55 denotes the function which takes any value of @xmath4 to @xmath46 , and @xmath53 denotes the function defined from @xmath46 and @xmath48 by primitive recursion , with @xmath56 and @xmath57 for every @xmath4 . in this last equation ,",
    "i have adopted the convention of writing @xmath58 instead of @xmath59 .",
    "it will be convenient below to augment the finite types with products @xmath60 , associated pairing operations @xmath61 , and projections @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "product types can be eliminated in the usual way by currying and replacing terms @xmath48 with sequences of terms @xmath64 .",
    "it will also be convenient to have disjoint union types @xmath65 , an element of which is either an element of @xmath38 or an element of @xmath39 , tagged to indicate which is the case .",
    "that is , for each such type we have insertion operations , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which convert elements of type @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively to an element of type @xmath65 ; predicates @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which indicate whether @xmath70 is tagged to be of type @xmath38 or @xmath39 ; and functions @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which interpret @xmath70 as an element of type @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "references to such sum types can be eliminated by taking @xmath65 to be @xmath73 , defining @xmath74 , defining @xmath75 , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are constant zero functionals of type @xmath38 , @xmath39 respectively , and so on .    in the next section",
    ", i will describe various double - negation interpretations that serve to reduce classical arithmetic , @xmath1 , to intuitionistic arithmetic , @xmath7  in fact , to @xmath7 taken over _",
    "minimal logic_. these show that if @xmath1 proves a @xmath2 formula @xmath78 , then @xmath7 proves @xmath79 ; in fact , a variant @xmath80 of @xmath7 based on minimal logic suffices .",
    "this reduces the problem to extracting computational information from the latter proof .",
    "one method of doing so involves using kreisel s notion of modified realizability , combined with the friedman a - translation .",
    "one can extend @xmath7 to a higher - type version , @xmath81 , which has variables ranging over arbitrary types , and terms of all the primitive recursive functionals .",
    "fix any primitive recursive relation @xmath82 ; then to each formula @xmath83 in the language of arithmetic , one inductively assigns a formula `` @xmath84 , '' as follows .",
    "@xmath85 now , suppose classical arithmetic proves @xmath78 , for some primitive recursive relation @xmath86 .",
    "then , using a double - negation translation , @xmath80 proves @xmath87 , and hence it proves @xmath88 for a fresh constant @xmath89 .",
    "fix @xmath82 in the realizability relation above to be the formula @xmath90 .",
    "inductively , one can then extract from the proof of term @xmath48 of @xmath9 such that @xmath81 proves that @xmath48 realizes @xmath91 .",
    "now notice that the identity function , @xmath92 , realizes @xmath93 , since a realizer to @xmath94 is simply a value of @xmath70 satisfying @xmath95 .",
    "thus if @xmath70 realizes @xmath96 , then @xmath97 satisfies @xmath98 .",
    "viewing @xmath70 , now , as a function of @xmath89 , yields the following conclusions :    [ main : witnessing : thm ] if classical arithmetic proves @xmath87 , there is a term @xmath99 of @xmath9 of type @xmath37 to @xmath37 such that @xmath81 proves @xmath100 .",
    "see @xcite for more about realizability , and @xcite for the a - translation .",
    "gdel s dialectica interpretation provides an alternative route to this result .",
    "in fact , one obtains a stronger conclusion , namely that the correctness of the witnessing term can be proved in a quantifier - free fragment @xmath101 of @xmath81 .",
    "to each formula @xmath22 in the language of arithmetic , one inductively assigns a formula @xmath102 of the form @xmath103 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are now tuples of variables of appropriate types .",
    "assuming @xmath104 , the assignment is defined as follows : @xmath105 the clause for implication is the most interesting among these , and can be understood as follows : from a witness , @xmath4 , to the hypothesis , @xmath106 is supposed to return a witness to the conclusion ; and given a purported counterexample , @xmath107 , to the conclusion , @xmath108 is supposed to return a counterexample to the hypothesis .",
    "since we have defined @xmath109 to be @xmath110 , notice that @xmath111 is @xmath112 .",
    "the dialectica interpretation of @xmath113 is @xmath114 , which is intuitionistically equivalent to @xmath115 , given the decidability of primitive recursive relations .",
    "one can show that from a proof of @xmath22 in @xmath7 , one can extract a term @xmath99 such that for every @xmath4 , @xmath101 proves @xmath116 , once again yielding theorem  [ main : witnessing : thm ] .",
    "we have seen that one can use modified realizability or the dialectica interpretation to extract an algorithm from a proof of a @xmath2 statement in classical arithmetic , modulo a method of reducing classical arithmetic to intuitionistic arithmetic .",
    "double negation translations provide the latter .",
    "a formula is said to be _ negative _ if it does not involve @xmath15 or @xmath17 and each atomic formula @xmath8 occurs in the form @xmath117 ; in other words , the formula is built up from negated atomic formula using @xmath14 , @xmath16 , @xmath18 , and @xmath12 . over minimal logic ,",
    "negative formulas are stable under double negation , which is to say , if @xmath22 is any negative formula , then @xmath7 proves that @xmath118 is equivalent to @xmath22 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the gdel - gentzen double - negation translation maps an arbitrary first - order formula @xmath22 to a negative formula , @xmath119 : @xmath120 the translation has the following properties :    for any formula @xmath22 and set of sentences",
    "@xmath121 :    1 .",
    "classical logic proves @xmath122 2 .",
    "if @xmath22 is provable from @xmath121 in classical logic , then @xmath119 is provable from @xmath123 in minimal logic .",
    "since the @xmath7 proves the @xmath124 translations of its own axioms , we have as a corollary :    if @xmath1 proves @xmath22 , then @xmath7 proves @xmath119 .",
    "in fact , one can strengthen the corollary in three ways :    1 .",
    "since @xmath7 proves @xmath125 for atomic formulas @xmath30 , one can define @xmath126 to be @xmath30 .",
    "2 .   assuming the language of @xmath7 includes , say , symbols denoting the primitive recursive functions , every negated atomic formula , @xmath127 , has an atomic equivalent , @xmath128 ; so one can define @xmath129 to be @xmath128 .",
    "the theorem remains true if one replaces @xmath7 by a suitable variant , @xmath80 , based on minimal logic .",
    "these considerations hold in the theorems that follow as well .",
    "the reason to be concerned about negations is that they are undesirable with respect to the two computational interpretations given in the last section , since they lead to the use of more complicated types in the resulting terms of @xmath9 .",
    "there is a variant of the double - negation translation known as the _ kuroda translation _ that fares slightly better in this regard : for any formula @xmath22 , let @xmath130 denote the result of doubly - negating atomic formulas , and adding a double negation _ after _ each universal quantifier , and , finally , adding a double - negation to the front of the formula .",
    "then we have :    for every formula @xmath22 , @xmath131 is provable in minimal logic",
    ". hence @xmath1 proves @xmath22 if and only if @xmath7 proves @xmath130 .",
    "note that intuitionistic logic , rather than minimal logic , is required in the conclusion .",
    "late in 2005 , grisha asked whether a version of the dialectica interpretation designed by shoenfield @xcite , for classical arithmetic , could be understood as a composition of the usual dialectica interpretation together with a double - negation translation .",
    "i set the question aside and solved it a few months later @xcite , only to find that ulrich kohlenbach and thomas streicher had solved it more quickly @xcite . in a way that can be made precise",
    ", the shoenfield translation corresponds to the following version of the double - negation interpretation ( itself a variant of a translation due to krivine ) , expressed for a basis involving the connectives @xmath132 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath14 .",
    "we define @xmath133 to be @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is defined recursively by clauses below .",
    "it helps to keep in mind that @xmath135 is supposed to represent the _ negation _ of @xmath22 : @xmath136 note that we can eliminate either @xmath137 or @xmath138 and retain a complete set of connectives , but including them both is more efficient",
    ". formulas of the form @xmath139 , however , have to be expressed as @xmath140 to apply the translation .    for every formula @xmath22 , @xmath141 is provable in minimal logic",
    ". hence @xmath1 proves @xmath22 if and only if @xmath80 proves @xmath133 .",
    "the @xmath142-translation is particularly good when it comes to formulas in negation - normal form ; it only adds two quantifiers for each existential quantifier , as well as one at the beginning . but one can do even better @xcite . taking advantage of the classical negation operator ,",
    "now @xmath143 is defined to be @xmath144 , where the map @xmath145 is defined recursively as follows : @xmath146 once again , we have    for every formula @xmath22 in negation - normal form , @xmath147 is provable in minimal logic",
    ". hence @xmath1 proves @xmath22 if and only if @xmath80 proves @xmath143 .",
    "the @xmath148-translation is extremely efficient with respect to negations , introducing , roughly , one at the beginning of the formula , and one for every quantifier alternation after an initial block of universal quantifiers .",
    "alternatively , can define @xmath149 in analogy to @xmath150 , as @xmath151 .",
    "this gives the translation the nice property that given the formulas @xmath143 and @xmath152 , one is the negation of the other .",
    "but there is a lot to be said for keeping negations to a minimum .",
    "of course , the @xmath148-translation extends to all classical formulas by identifying them with their canonical negation - normal form equivalents .",
    "since the translation relies on the negation - normal form representation of classical formulas , it shares many nice properties with a more complicated double - negation translation due to girard  @xcite .",
    "it is this translation that i will use , in the next section , to provide an efficient computational interpretation of classical arithmetic .",
    "let me close with one more translation , found in @xcite , which is interesting in its own right . for reasons that will become clear later on , i will call it `` the awkward translation '' :",
    "if @xmath22 is any formula in negation - normal form , let @xmath153 denote @xmath154 .",
    "[ awk : prop ] for any formula @xmath22 , @xmath155 is provable in minimal logic .",
    "hence , @xmath1 proves @xmath22 if and only if @xmath80 proves @xmath153 .    once can show by induction that if @xmath32 is any formula in negation - normal form , then @xmath156 is provable in minimal logic .",
    "so minimal logic proves that @xmath21 implies @xmath157 , and hence that @xmath158 implies @xmath153 .",
    "but since @xmath21 is classically equivalent to @xmath19 , @xmath158 is equivalent to @xmath159 , which is implied by @xmath119 .",
    "the @xmath160-translation is almost absurdly efficient with respect to negations : the one classical negation on the inside adds no negations at all ( recall that in arithmetic , negated atomic formulas have atomic equivalents ) , and the translation adds only one negation on the outside .",
    "but the attentive reader will have noticed that the first assertion in theorem  [ awk : prop ] is slightly weaker than the corresponding assertions in the the theorems that precede it : only one direction of the equivalence is minimally valid .",
    "we will see , in section  [ herbrand : section ] , that this means that the translation fares very poorly with respect to modus ponens , making it impossible to translate ordinary proofs piece by piece .",
    "for pure first - order logic , an alternative proof of theorem  [ awk : prop ] can be found in @xcite .",
    "benno van den berg ( personal communication ) later hit upon this same translation , independently .",
    "in @xcite , i claimed that with intuitionistic logic in place of minimal logic , the result is a consequence of a characterization of glivenko formulas due to orevkov , described in a very nice survey ( * ? ? ? * section 3.2.5 ) of russian proof theory by grisha . ;",
    "the last class seven lines from the bottom of the page should be @xmath161 ; and the first class at the bottom line should be @xmath162 . ] that seems to be incorrect ; but van den berg and streicher have pointed out to me that in that case the result follows a theorem due to mints and orevkov ( * ? ? ? * , paragraph 4 ) .",
    "we now obtain direct computational interpretations of classical arithmetic simply by combining the @xmath148-translation of section  [ double : negation : section ] with the computational interpretations of @xmath80 given in section  [ preliminaries : section ]",
    ". one annoying consequence of the use of the classical negation operator in the @xmath148-translation is that it is impossible to carry out the translation of a formula @xmath22 from the inside out : depending on the context in which a subformula @xmath32 occurs , the computational interpretation of the full formula may depend on either the computational interpretation of @xmath32 or the computational interpretation of @xmath163 . in practice ,",
    "then , it is often more convenient to carry out the interpretation in two steps , applying the @xmath148-translation first , and then one of the two computational interpretations described in section  [ preliminaries : section ] . nonetheless , it is interesting to see what happens when the steps are composed , which is what i will do here .",
    "both translations apply to formulas in negation - normal form , and we can assume that negated atomic subformulas are replaced by their atomic equivalents .    as in section",
    "[ preliminaries : section ] , the appropriate version of classical realizability is defined relative to a fixed primitive recursive predicate @xmath82 .",
    "most of the clauses look just like ordinary modified realizability : @xmath164 one can then straightforwardly extract , from any proof of a formula @xmath22 in classical arithmetic , a term @xmath70 that refutes @xmath21 . but now notice that the identity function realizes @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is the negation of @xmath8 ; so , from a proof of @xmath167 in classical arithmetic , since the identity function realizes @xmath165 , one obtains a term @xmath70 satisfying @xmath168 .",
    "this provides a direct proof of theorem  [ main : witnessing : thm ] .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .",
    "a more elaborate realizability relation , based on the a - translation , can be found in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding variant of the dialectica translation is similarly straightforward . as with the shoenfield variant @xcite , each formula @xmath22",
    "is mapped to a formula @xmath169 of the form @xmath170 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are sequences of variables .",
    "assuming @xmath171 is @xmath172 , the translation is defined recursively , as follows : @xmath173 on can interpret this as saying that for any function @xmath174 that purports to witness @xmath175 , there are a @xmath176 and an @xmath177 denying that claim .",
    "once again , one can straightforwardly extract , from any proof of a formula @xmath22 in classical arithmetic , a term @xmath70 satisfying @xmath178 .",
    "this provides another direct proof of theorem  [ main : witnessing : thm ] .",
    "i would now like to come back to the `` awkward translation , '' discussed at the end of section  [ double : negation : section ] .",
    "i will do this via what at first might seem to be a digression through kreisel s _ no - counterexample interpretation_. let @xmath22 be a formula in prenex form , for example , @xmath179 the _ herbrand normal form _",
    "@xmath180 of @xmath22 is obtained by replacing the universally quantified variables of @xmath22 by function symbols that depend on the preceding existential variables , to obtain @xmath181 it is not hard to check that , in classical logic , @xmath22 implies @xmath180 .",
    "thus , by a slight variant of theorem  [ main : witnessing : thm ] ( relativizing it to function symbols ) , if classical arithmetic proves @xmath22 , there will be terms @xmath182 and @xmath183 of @xmath9 such that @xmath81 proves @xmath184 think of @xmath185 and @xmath186 as providing purported counterexamples to the truth of @xmath22 , so that @xmath187 and @xmath188 effectively foil such counterexamples .",
    "the no - counterexample interpretation is simply the generalization of this transformation to arbitrary prenex formulas .",
    "one need not invoke herbrand normal form to arrive at the previous conclusion .",
    "one can check that if @xmath22 is a prenex formula , the no - counterexample interpretation of @xmath22 is essentially just the dialectica interpretation of @xmath153 , so the result follows from theorem  [ awk : prop ] as well .",
    "the no - counterexample interpretation can be viewed as a computational interpretation of arithmetic .",
    "but , in a remarkable article @xcite , kohlenbach has shown that it is not a very _ modular _ computational interpretation , in the sense that it does not have nice behavior with respect to modus ponens . to make this claim precise , note that the set of ( terms denoting ) primitive recursive functionals , @xmath9 , can be stratified into increasing subsets @xmath189 , in such a way that any finite fragment of @xmath7 has a dialectica interpretation ( or modified realizability interpretation ) using only terms in that set .",
    "kohlenbach ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.2 ) shows :    [ kohlenbach : theorem ] for every @xmath190 there are sentences @xmath22 and @xmath32 of arithmetic such that :    1 .",
    "@xmath22 is prenex .",
    "2 .   @xmath32 is a @xmath2 sentence , that is , of the form @xmath191 for some primitive recursive relation @xmath86 .",
    "3 .   primitive recursive arithmetic proves @xmath22 .",
    "4 .   @xmath1 proves @xmath34 .",
    "5 .   @xmath22 and every prenexation of @xmath34 has a no - counterexample interpretation with functionals in @xmath192 .    but :    1 .",
    "there is no term @xmath99 of @xmath189 which satisfies the no - counterexample interpretation of @xmath32 ; that is , there is no term @xmath99 such that @xmath100 is true in the standard model of arithmetic .",
    "theorem  [ kohlenbach : theorem ] shows that there is no straightforward way to combine witnesses to the no - counterexample interpretations of @xmath22 and @xmath34 , respectively , to obtain a witness to the no - counterexample interpretation of @xmath32 .",
    "the problem with the awkward translation is that , similarly , it may behave poorly with respect to modus ponens .",
    "consider pure first - order logic with a single predicate symbol , @xmath193 .",
    "then there are formulas @xmath22 and @xmath32 such that @xmath194 does nt follow from @xmath153 and @xmath195 in minimal logic : just take @xmath22 to be the formula @xmath196 and @xmath32 to be @xmath12 . in that case , @xmath197 is equivalent , over minimal logic , to the double - negation shift , @xmath198 , which is not even provable in intuitionistic logic .    when i showed the awkward translation to grisha , he remarked right away that its behavior has something to do with kohlenbach s result . at the time , i had no idea what he meant ; but writing this paper finally prodded me to sort it out .",
    "grisha was right : theorem  [ kohlenbach : theorem ] can , in fact , be used to show that the awkward translation does not provide a modular translation of peano arithmetic to heyting arithmetic , in the following sense .",
    "[ awk : theorem ] for any fragment @xmath199 of @xmath7 , there are formulas @xmath22 and @xmath32 such that the following hold :    1 .",
    "@xmath1 proves @xmath22 and @xmath34 , but 2 .   @xmath200",
    "together with @xmath153 and @xmath195 does not prove @xmath194 .",
    "this shows that modus ponens fails under the @xmath160-translation , in a strong way .",
    "since @xmath1 proves @xmath22 and @xmath34 , it also proves @xmath32 , and so by theorem  [ awk : prop ] , @xmath7 proves @xmath194 . but having the translation @xmath153 and @xmath195 may not help much in obtaining such a proof of @xmath194 ; indeed , obtaining a proof of @xmath194 from @xmath153 and @xmath195 may be no easier than simply proving @xmath194 outright .",
    "given @xmath199 , first let @xmath190 be large enough so that the dialectica interpretation of @xmath199 uses only terms in @xmath189 , and then let @xmath22 and @xmath32 be as in theorem  [ kohlenbach : theorem ] . if there were a proof of @xmath194 from @xmath153 and @xmath195 in @xmath199 , applying the dialectica interpretation , one would obtain terms witnessing the dialectica interpretation of @xmath194 from terms witnessing the dialectica interpretations of @xmath153 and @xmath195 .",
    "but the dialectica interpretation of @xmath153 is the no - counterexample interpretation of @xmath22 , and it is not hard to check that the dialectica interpretation of @xmath195 is the no - counterexample interpretation of one of the prenexations of @xmath34 .",
    "thus there would be a witness to the no - counterexample interpretation of @xmath32 in @xmath189 , contrary to the choice of @xmath22 and @xmath32 .",
    "as noted in the introduction , conventional wisdom holds that classical logic is `` nondeterministic , '' in that different ways of extracting algorithms from classical proofs can yield different results . sometimes , however , nondeterminacy is unavoidable .",
    "for example , even minimal logic can prove @xmath201 , and any computational interpretation of this formula will have to choose either @xmath4 or @xmath5 to witness the conclusion .",
    "the difference is that this sentence is typically not taken to be an _ axiom _ of minimal logic ; rather , there are two axioms , @xmath202 and @xmath203 , and any proof of the sentence has to choose one or the other .",
    "in contrast , standard calculi for classical logic provide cases where there are multiple choices of witnesses , with no principled reason to choose one over the other .",
    "for example , starting from canonical proofs of @xmath204 and @xmath205 , one can weaken the conclusions to obtain proofs of @xmath206 and @xmath207 , for an arbitrary formula , @xmath22 . then , using the law of the excluded middle , @xmath208 , one can combine these to obtain a proof of @xmath209 where there is little reason to favor @xmath70 or @xmath210 as the implicit witness to the existential quantifier .",
    "( this example is essentially that given by lafont @xcite . )",
    "this shows that standard classical calculi are nondeterministic in a way that proofs in intuitionistic and minimal logic are not .",
    "girard @xcite has neatly diagnosed the source of the nondeterminacy , and has provided a calculus for classical logic that eliminates it by forcing the prover to make an explicit choice in exactly those situations where an ambiguity would otherwise arise . from @xmath118 and @xmath211 , and this inference is needed to verify the classical axiom @xmath125 under the double - negation translation .",
    "another way is to notice that since , in classical logic , @xmath22 and @xmath118 are equivalent , there is little reason to favor @xmath22 or @xmath19 in situations where intuitionistic logic treats them differently .",
    "i am grateful to thomas streicher for these insights . ] but note that the realizability interpretation of section  [ realizability : section ] also avoids this nondeterminacy ; the translation procedure described in @xcite is fully explicit and unambiguous . with respect to the example discussed in the last paragraph , the interpretation chooses @xmath70 or @xmath210 based on the logical form of @xmath22 .",
    "and @xmath118 have the same negation - normal form , which is distinct from ( and dual to ) that of @xmath19 . ] indeed , the results of @xcite show that the witnesses obtained in this way coincide with those obtained using a natural class of cut - elimination procedures .",
    "yet another response to the example above is that of urban and bierman @xcite , who simply embrace the nondeterminism as an inherent part of the computational interpretation of classical logic .",
    "in fact , urban @xcite has provided a nondeterministic programming language to interpret classical logic in a natural way . passing through a double - negation interpretation , as we have done here ,",
    "amounts to making specific choices to resolve the nondeterminism .",
    "it is an open - ended conceptual problem to understand which deterministic instances of the general nondeterministic algorithms can be realized in such a way .    at this point , however , we should be clearer as to the goals of our analysis .",
    "ordinary mathematical proofs are not written in formal languages , and so the process of extracting an algorithm from even a rather constructive mathematical argument can involve nondeterminism of sorts . and , despite some interesting explorations in this direction @xcite , it is far from clear that classical arithmetic can be used as an effective programming language in its own right .",
    "but formal methods are actively being developed in support of software verification @xcite , and a better understanding of the computational content of classical logic may support the development of better logical frameworks for that purpose @xcite .",
    "formal translations like the ones described here have also been effective in `` proof mining , '' the practice of using logical methods to extract mathematically useful information from nonconstructive proofs @xcite .",
    "grisha s work has , primarily , addressed the general foundational question as to the computational content of classical methods . in that respect ,",
    "the general metatheorems described here provide a satisfying answer : for the most part , classical mathematical reasoning _ does _ have computational content , which is to say , algorithms can be extracted from classical proofs ; but by suppressing computational detail , the proofs often leave algorithmic detail underspecified , rendering them amenable to different implementations .",
    "grisha s work has thus contributed to an understanding of the computational content of classical arithmetic that is mathematically and philosophically satisfying , providing a solid basis for further scientific research .",
