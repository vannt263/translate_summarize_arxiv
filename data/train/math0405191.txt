    "free probability has at least three basic facets : operator algebras , random matrices , and the combinatorics of non - crossing diagrams .",
    "this can be seen very clearly in voiculescu s generalization of wigner s semi - circle law to the case of several independent matrices @xcite .",
    "the distribution arising in this limit of random matrices can be modelled by a sum of creation and annihilation operators on full fock spaces and described nicely in terms of non - crossing partitions .    on the random matrix side ,",
    "voiculescu s theorem describes the leading contribution to the large @xmath0-limit of expectations of traces of gaussian random matrices .",
    "however , in the random matrix literature there are many investigations on more refined questions in this context . on one side , subleading contributions to the large @xmath0-limit are of interest and have to be understood up to some point for dealing with questions concerning the largest eigenvalue of such random matrices . on the other side ,",
    "there has also been a lot of interest in leading contributions to other important quantities , like , e.g. , global fluctuations ( i.e. , variance of two traces ) of the considered random matrices .",
    "one should note that there are relations between these two questions .",
    "we are not going to explore these relations here , but we want to direct the reader s attention to the so - called  loop equations \" in the physical literature ( see , e.g. @xcite ) and to the  master equation \" in @xcite",
    ".    we will concentrate in this paper on the second kind of question . as is well - known from the physical literature , in many cases these leading contributions",
    "are given by planar ( or genus zero ) diagrams and thus have quite a bit the flavour of the combinatorics of free probability .",
    "in the recent paper @xcite this description was made precise for the global fluctuations in the case of wishart matrices , and in particular the relevant set of planar diagrams (  annular non - crossing permutations \" ) was introduced and examined . however ,",
    "this description of the fluctuations in the large @xmath0-limit was on a purely combinatorial level . since it looks quite similar to the description of free poisson distributions in terms of non - crossing partitions , one expects to find some genuine free probability behind these results .",
    "in particular , one would expect to have a description on the level of operator algebras and to have also a precise statement of the kind of  freeness \" that arises here .    in this paper",
    "we will show that this is indeed the case . on one hand , using the notion of a cyclic fock space",
    ", we can formulate the fluctuations in terms of the usual creation , annihilation , and preservation operators . on the other hand",
    ", we will also introduce an abstract ",
    "freeness \" property for bilinear tracial functionals , which not only give us a conceptual understanding , but , on the other hand , is also crucial for proving our main theorems on the fluctuations .",
    "second order freeness , while stronger than the freeness of voiculescu , nevertheless appears to be a central feature of ensembles of random matrices .",
    "indeed , in this paper we prove that two standard examples of random matrix ensembles exhibit second order freeness : orthogonal families of gaussian random matrices and orthogonal families of wishart random matrices are asymptotically free of second order .",
    "moreover in @xcite we show that independent haar distributed random unitary matrices are asymptotically free of second order .",
    "the main results of the paper are thus . in section 5",
    "( with proofs in section 7 ) we show that semi - circular and compound poisson families on the full fock space are free of second order .",
    "in section 6 we establish the basic properties of second order freeness and prove a general limit theorem .",
    "in section 8 we diagonalize the fluctuations in the gaussian and wishart case , thus recovering and extending results of cabanal - duvillard @xcite . in section 9",
    "we prove asymptotic freeness of second order for orthogonal families of gaussian and wishart random matrices .",
    "here we collect some general notation and concepts which we will use in the following .    our presentation should be , by and large , self - contained , however , it will rely of course on the basic ideas and concepts of free probability . for more details on this ,",

    "@xmath54 one has to choose a cyclic order on each of the blocks of @xmath21 .",
    "choosing such an order for each block will produce an  annular non - crossing permutation \" out of an annular non - crossing partition .",
    "the set of annular non - crossing permutations is denoted by @xmath55  and by @xmath56 in the multi - annular case  and it is this set which was the main object of interest in @xcite . in [ mn ,",
    " 6 ] it was shown that a permutation @xmath57 is in @xmath58 if two conditions are satisfied .",
    "the first condition is _ connectedness _ : at least one cycle of @xmath57 connects the two circles and the second is _ planarity _ : the _ geodesic condition _ must be satisfied : @xmath59 , where @xmath60 denotes the number of cycles of @xmath54 and @xmath61 is the permutation with two cycles : @xmath62    we wish to describe what it means to be a a non - crossing permutation on an @xmath28 multi - annulus . by an @xmath28 multi - annulus we mean a collection of @xmath28 circles with @xmath63 points on the first circle , @xmath64 points on the second circle ,  , @xmath65 points on the @xmath66 circle .",
    "connectivity of @xmath57 means that every pair of circles is connected by at least one cycle of @xmath57 .",

    "there is not necessarily a unique choice of a cyclic order on a block of @xmath21 ; to put it another way , the mapping from @xmath54 to @xmath21 ( which consists in forgetting the order on the cycles ) is not injective .",

    "let us consider a block @xmath43 , and denote by @xmath71 $ ] and @xmath72 $ ] the parts of @xmath47 lying on the first and on the second circle , respectively .",
    "on each of the two circles we respect the given cyclic order on @xmath73 and on @xmath74 the allowed orders on @xmath47 thus consist of choosing a ` first ' element of @xmath48 and a ` first ' element of @xmath49 ; then the order on @xmath47 is obtained by running through @xmath48 from the first to the last element , then going over to the first element in @xmath49 and continuing in @xmath49 to the last element .",

    "if , however , there is more than one through - block , then the first element on each component of them is uniquely determined and there is exactly one possible order for each block .    for gaussian random matrices only non - crossing pairings will play a role .",
    "these are those annular non - crossing partitions for which each block consists of exactly two elements .",

    "this theorem contains all relevant combinatorial information about the asymptotic behaviour of our traces .",
