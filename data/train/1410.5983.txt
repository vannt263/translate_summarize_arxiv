    "the study of quantum field theory on black hole spacetimes has mostly been restricted to static , spherically symmetric spacetimes .",
    "nevertheless , there have been attempts at considering stationary black hole spacetimes , with the main focus on the kerr spacetime @xcite .",
    "one important task is the computation of expectation values of the renormalized stress - energy tensor for a matter field in a given quantum state @xcite .",
    "this has proven to be very challenging and , so far , almost all calculations have only addressed the differences between expectation values for different quantum states @xcite and the large field mass limit @xcite . in @xcite , the stress - energy tensor for",
    "the rotating btz black hole @xcite was renormalized with respect to ads@xmath0 , by using the fact that the black hole corresponds to ads@xmath0 with discrete identifications , but this method can not be used for more general classes of rotating black hole solutions .",
    "we could summarize the main difficulties in three points : ( i ) the technical complexity of the computations required for the kerr spacetime , due to the lack of spherical symmetry , ( ii ) the nonexistence of generalizations of the ( globally defined , regular and isometry - invariant ) hartle - hawking state defined in static spacetimes , and ( iii ) the unavailability of euclidean methods which simplify the task in static spacetimes .    to tackle point ( i ) , we focus on a rotating black hole spacetime in 2 + 1 dimensions , the spacelike stretched black hole @xcite .",
    "this is a vacuum solution of topologically massive gravity ( tmg ) @xcite , a deformation of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional einstein gravity , and it can be thought of as a `` warped '' version of the btz black hole .",
    "in contrast to the btz solution , the causal structure of the spacelike stretched black hole is similar to that of the kerr spacetime  @xcite . in this",
    "setting , the matter field equations can be solved in terms of hypergeometric functions , which considerably simplify the technical issues in comparison with the kerr spacetime .",
    "these black hole solutions are known to be classically stable to massive scalar field perturbations and , in particular , classical superradiance does not give rise to superradiant instabilities  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we study a quantum scalar field on this black hole spacetime .    concerning point ( ii ) , the hartle - hawking vacuum state in the schwarzschild spacetime is well known not to generalize to the kerr spacetime  @xcite .",
    "as reviewed in @xcite , this is linked to the existence of a speed - of - light surface , outside of which no observer can corotate with the kerr horizon .",
    "however , if we surround the kerr hole by a mirror that is inside the speed - of - light surface , and we introduce appropriate boundary conditions at the mirror , then a hartle - hawing state ( regular at the horizon and invariant under the isometries of the spacetime ) exists inside the mirror .",
    "further , this hartle - hawking state is known to be free from superradiant instabilities for a massless field @xcite and the same conclusion may well extend to a massive field . in this paper",
    "we introduce a similar mirror on the @xmath1-dimensional spacelike stretched black hole , and we consider the similar hartle - hawking state inside this mirror .",
    "this @xmath1-dimensional hartle - hawking state is known to be free of superradiant instabilities for massless as well as massive fields  @xcite .",
    "finally , regarding point ( iii ) , while kerr does not admit a real section with a positive definite metric  @xcite , it does admit a real section with a complex riemannian metric to which the feynman propagator in the hartle - hawking state inside a mirror can be analytically continued  @xcite .",
    "this complex riemannian , or `` quasi - euclidean '' , section on kerr , hence , serves as the counterpart of the more familiar euclidean ( or riemannian ) section of static black hole spacetimes . in this paper",
    "we introduce the similar complex riemanian section of the spacelike stretched black hole , and we exploit this section to renormalize the vacuum expectation value of a massive scalar field .",
    "the crucial point is that the complex riemannian section of the spacelike stretched black hole has a unique green s function , and this green s function is expressible as a discrete mode sum whose divergence at the coincidence limit can be matched to that of a corresponding mode sum on a complex riemannian section of a rotating flat spacetime .",
    "the renormalization procedure in the hartle - hawking state can , hence , be carried out using this discrete mode sum .    in summary , in this paper we shall compute the renormalized vacuum polarization @xmath2 of a massive scalar field @xmath3 in the hartle - hawking state on a spacelike stretched black hole surrounded by a mirror with dirichlet boundary conditions , implementing the hadamard renormalization prescription on the complex riemannian section of the spacetime . in the first instance , this calculation can be taken as a warm - up for the computation of the renormalized stress - energy tensor on the spacelike stretched black hole . in the longer perspective , we believe that all the conceptual aspects of our method are applicable to wide classes of rotating black hole spacetimes , and",
    "in particular to kerr in four dimensions .",
    "an implementation of our method in more than three dimensions will of course face new technical issues due to the more complicated functions that arise in the separation of the wave equation .",
    "the contents of the paper are as follows .",

    "@xmath45 is null at the horizon and at @xmath46 which is the location of the speed - of - light surface .    in the context of quantum field theory ,",
    "as it is detailed below , the nonexistence of an everywhere timelike killing vector field in the exterior region of the spacetime is directly related to the nonexistence of a well defined quantum vacuum state which is regular at the horizon and is invariant under the isometries of the spacetime . for the kerr spacetime ,",
    "this has been proven in @xcite .",
    "a vacuum state with these properties can however be defined if we restrict the spacetime by inserting an appropriate mirrorlike boundary which respects the killing isometries of the spacetime .",

    "so far , only classical theory has been discussed .",
    "we now proceed to canonically quantize the scalar field using the standard hilbert space approach .",

    "since the l and r solutions are positive frequency with respect to the affine parameters of the past and future horizons , this vacuum state is regular at the horizons . furthermore , it is invariant under the spacetime isometries .",

    "the feynman propagator , evaluated for certain quantum states , as defined in , is a bidistribution of hadamard type ; i.e. it has a hadamard expansion of the form @xmath90 here , we assume that @xmath91 and @xmath92 belong to a geodesically convex neighborhood @xmath93 ; that is , they are linked by a unique geodesic which lies entirely in @xmath94 . additionally , @xmath95 is the synge s world function , defined such that @xmath96 is the half of the square of the geodesic distance between @xmath91 and @xmath92 ; @xmath97 and @xmath98 are symmetric and regular biscalar functions .    a quantum state for which the short - distance singularity structure of @xmath99 is given by is called a `` hadamard state '' .",
    "it can be shown ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that @xmath100 only depends on the geometry along the geodesics joining @xmath91 to @xmath92 , whereas @xmath101 contains the quantum state dependence of the feynman propagator .",

    "in this section , we first consider the complex riemannian section of the spacelike stretched black hole and obtain the unique green s function associated with the klein - gordon equation as a mode sum .",
    "this is followed by a detailed account of the hadamard renormalization procedure , in which we subtract the divergences in the mode sum by a sum over minkowski modes with the same singularity structure .",
    "a similar subtraction procedure in a static four - dimensional black hole spacetime in with a cosmic string has been considered in  @xcite .",
    "euclidean methods are a powerful tool to study quantum field theory on static spacetimes .",
    "a  static spacetime is a real lorentzian section of a complex manifold , for which it is always possible to find a real riemannian ( or `` euclidean '' ) section by performing an appropriate analytical continuation ( usually a wick rotation @xmath115 , where @xmath33 is a global timelike coordinate ) . in many cases ,",
    "it is much easier to perform calculations in the riemannian section ( e.g. computing the unique green s function associated with the scalar field equation ) and then analytically continue the results back to the lorentzian section .",
    "the analytic continuation procedure does unfortunately not have an immediate generalization to spacetimes that are stationary but not static .",
    "for the exterior of a rotating black hole , one issue is that the exterior need not have a globally defined timelike vector even when each point in the exterior has a neighborhood with such a killing vector .",
    "a  second issue is that there may exist no analytic continuation in the coordinates that results in a real section with a positive definite metric .",
    "both of these issues are present in kerr ( for which the absence of a real section with a positive definite metric is shown in  @xcite ) and in our @xmath1-dimensional spacelike stretched black holes .",
    "it may be possible to obtain a positive definite metric by analytically continuing not just the coordinates but also the parameters ( for continuing the angular momentum parameter in kerr see  @xcite ) , but the physical relevance of continuing parameters seems debatable @xcite and we shall not consider such a continuation here .    for our purposes , it will not be necessary to give an analytic continuation procedure for the full exterior region of the black hole spacetime , but just for region  @xmath54 .",
    "in this region there exists an everywhere timelike killing vector field , @xmath51 .",
    "if we now perform a wick rotation @xmath116 , with @xmath117 , the metric becomes @xmath118 this is the complex - valued metric @xmath119 of the `` complex riemannian '' ( or `` quasi - euclidean '' ) section @xmath120 of a complex manifold , in which region @xmath54 is a real lorentzian section .",

    "the complex riemannian section of certain rotating spacetimes has been briefly discussed in @xcite and @xcite in the context of the kerr - newman black hole . in @xcite , a more general concept of ` local wick rotation '",
    "is discussed for any lorentzian manifold , even without a timelike killing vector field , as long as its metric is a locally analytic function of the coordinates .      in the real lorentzian section",
    ", we defined the feynman propagator @xmath125 as one of the green s functions associated with the klein - gordon equation satisfied by the scalar field . here , we find the green s function @xmath126 associated with the klein - gordon equation in the complex riemannian section .",
    "it satisfies the distributional equation @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129 is the covariant dalembertian operator .",

    "this is due to the fact that two of the directions of the spacetime are periodic , while the third direction is compact .",
