    "the @xmath8 gauge structure of the standard model ( sm ) for elementary particles has been tested precisely  @xcite .",
    "a missing piece is the higgs boson , which is responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking and mass generation mechanisms for all sm particles .",
    "it is expected that the higgs boson will be discovered at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) in near future .",
    "the lhc is also searching for the evidence of new physics beyond the sm  @xcite .",
    "the lhc has already clarified the absence of light new colored particles ; e.g. , squarks and gluinos in the supersymmetric theories  @xcite , or forth generation quarks  @xcite .",
    "however , a light particle without strong interactions has not been ruled out yet by the lhc data because of small production cross sections .",
    "the higgs sector is totally unknown , since no higgs boson has been discovered yet  @xcite . in the sm , only one scalar iso - doublet field",
    "is introduced to spontaneously break the electroweak gauge symmetry . however , since there is no reason for the higgs sector with only one doublet , there is a possibility of non - minimal higgs sectors .",
    "there are two important experimental constraints on extended higgs sectors ; i.e. , the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) and the electroweak rho parameter . in the sm ,",
    "these constraints are automatically satisfied : fcnc is suppressed by the glashow - illiopoulos - maiani mechanism , and the rho parameter is predicted to be unity at the tree level due to the custodial @xmath9 symmetry . on the other hand , non - minimal higgs sectors suffer from both of them in general .",
    "it is known that in the higgs sector with only doublets , the rho parameter is predicted to be unity at the tree level , while higgs models with higher representations such as those with triplet fields predict the rho parameter to be different values from unity .",
    "therefore , two higgs doublet models ( thdms ) would be a simplest viable extension of the sm .",
    "however , in the thdm the most general yukawa interaction predicts fcnc at the tree level , because both the doublet couples to a fermion so that the mass matrix and the yukawa matrix can not be diagonalized simultaneously . in order to avoid this",
    ", a discrete symmetry may be introduced under which different properties are assigned to each scalar doublet  @xcite . under this symmetry ,",
    "each fermion couples with only one scalar doublet , and hence there are no fcnc at the tree level even in the thdm .",
    "there are four types of yukawa interactions depending on the @xmath10-charge assignments ; i.e. , type - i , ii , x and y. type - ii is the most familiar type of yukawa interactions in the thdm , which is the higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "another interesting possibility would be the type - x thdm , where one higgs doublet couples with quarks and the other does with leptons  @xcite .",
    "the type - x thdm can appear in the higgs sector of a gauged extension of the type - iii seesaw model  @xcite , the model of three - loop seesaw with electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite and a model for positron cosmic ray anomaly  @xcite .",
    "in the sm - like limit , where only one of the cp - even higgs bosons couples to the gauge bosons , the yukawa couplings of the other higgs bosons tend to be lepton - specific . since yukawa coupling constants are proportional to the mass of fermions , these extra higgs bosons predominantly decay into tau leptons for the wide range of the parameter space  @xcite .",
    "the tau lepton has a relatively short lifetime as compared with the muon .",
    "it decays into lighter leptons and/or hadrons with neutrinos in the detector .",
    "the decay products always produce missing energies , which make event reconstructions rather complicated .",
    "however , for an energetic tau lepton , the missing momentum from its decay tends to be oriented to the same direction of the charged track  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the tau lepton momentum can be approximately reconstructed by using the collinear approximation  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the decay of the tau lepton is correlated by its polarization , which can be used to separate leptonic decays from hadronic decays  @xcite .    in this paper , we study multi-@xmath0 signatures at the lhc in the lepton - specific thdm in the sm - like limit",
    ". masses of extra higgs bosons can be of the order of a hundred gev under the @xmath11 results .",
    "then the gluon fusion mechanism for such extra higgs bosons is suppressed at hadron colliders . in this case , extra higgs bosons can be pair produced ; @xmath2 and @xmath12 ( @xmath4 ) , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are cp - even , odd and charged higgs bosons , respectively .",
    "produced higgs bosons mainly decay into tau leptons because the yukawa coupling constant is proportional the fermion mass .",
    "these characteristic decay modes can be observed in multi-@xmath0 signatures at the lhc .",
    "we perform detailed simulation studies for the pair production of the extra higgs bosons where they subsequently decay into multi-@xmath0 states .",
    "it is found that the main background can be considerably reduced by requiring the high multiplicity of leptons and tau - jets with appropriate kinematical cuts in the final state . assuming the integrated luminosity of a hundred of inverse fb",
    ", the excess can be seen in various three- and four - lepton channels .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we summarize the type - x thdm and give basic constraints on the model .",

    "this information may be useful to estimate the variation of our results by changing the conditions of tau - jet tagging , and also to compare with the actual experimental situation at the lhc .",
    "the tau - jet tagging efficiency is estimated from the signal events in @xmath71 and @xmath76 channels from @xmath83 production and @xmath84 production , respectively . in the @xmath71 channel ,",
    "the number of events after the pre - selection for the signal events is @xmath85 for the integrated luminosity of 100  fb@xmath78 ( see table  [ tab : lhc_4 t ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the expected number of the @xmath57 final - state is @xmath86\\times100~[\\text{fb}^{-1}]\\sim5000 $ ] . from this",
    ", the probability of finding the tau - jet per decay of one tau lepton is estimated to be @xmath87 .",
    "this can be interpreted as the product of the branching ratio of the hadronic decay of tau leptons , the acceptance ratio for @xmath88 and @xmath89  gev and also the tau - jet tagging efficiency . by using the branching ratio of hadronic decays of tau leptons which is about 65%  @xcite ,",
    "the multiplication of the the acceptance ratio and tau - jet tagging efficiency is estimated to be @xmath90 .",
    "further separation of the two factors is too confusing to us . for confirmation",
    "we have checked that the obtained value gives roughly correct number of the signal events from @xmath91 production in the @xmath76 channel by @xmath92\\times100~[\\text{fb}^{-1}]\\times(0.50)^3\\sim2500 $ ] ( compare with the number of signal events from @xmath84 production after the pre - selection in table  [ tab : lhc_3tc ] ) .",

    "the numbers of events from the @xmath62jets production after the pre - selection are 2.9@xmath93 and 2.3@xmath94 for the @xmath67 and @xmath75 channels , respectively , where here the requirement of the zero charge - sum is not imposed in the former channel . for our @xmath62jets events ,",

    "similarly the mis - tagging probability for the @xmath61 events can be estimated by using the dimuon decay of the @xmath61 events .",
    "for the @xmath61 events , one or two jets are expected to be originated from the @xmath99 quark , and the mis - tagging probability for such jets may be different from that for the light - flavor jets .",
    "however , we ignore the difference of the mis - tagging probabilities by the flavor of jets . the number of events for the dimuon decay mode of our @xmath61 events is given as @xmath100\\times100~[\\text{fb}^{-1}]\\times ( 0.107)^2\\sim 5.6\\cdot10^{5}$ ] .",
    "for the dimuon decay channel in our @xmath61 events , an average number of the primal jet with @xmath88 and @xmath89  gev is @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the fraction of events with @xmath103 primal - jets which satisfies @xmath104 , and also an average number of the combination of the two primal jets is @xmath105 . by removing the requirement of zero charge - sum of the four - lepton at the pre - selection in the @xmath67 channel ,",
    "the number of events after the pre - selection is @xmath106 , thus the mis - tagging probability is estimated to be @xmath107 . on the other hand , for the @xmath75 channel , the mis - tagging probability is estimated to be @xmath108 .",
    "thus the mis - tagging probability per jet for the @xmath61 process should be also a few percent .",
    "the smaller mis - tagging probability for the @xmath61 process by our rough estimation may be due to the large qcd activity in the @xmath61 events which could prevent the isolation of the charged tracks in the tau - jets .    one may be able to reduce the mis - tagging probability with minor loss of tagging efficiency , e.g. , by using only the 1-prong ( or 3-prong ) decay mode of tau leptons and/or by applying more tight tagging conditions .",

    "<S> a detailed simulation study is performed for multi-@xmath0 signatures at the large hadron collider , which can be used to probe additional higgs bosons with lepton - specific yukawa interactions . </S>",
    "<S> such an extended higgs sector is introduced in some of new physics models at the tev scale . </S>",
    "<S> we here consider the two higgs doublet model with the type - x yukawa interaction , where nonstandard higgs bosons predominantly decay into tau leptons . </S>",
    "<S> these extra higgs bosons can be pair produced via @xmath1-channel gauge boson mediation at hadron colliders ; @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are cp - even , odd and charged higgs bosons , respectively . consequently , multi-@xmath0 originated signals appear in the final state as a promising signature of such a model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the main background can be considerably reduced by requiring the high multiplicity of leptons and tau - jets with appropriate kinematical cuts in the final state . </S>",
    "<S> thus , assuming the integrated luminosity of a hundred of inverse fb , the excess can be seen in various three- and four - lepton channels . with the integrated luminosity of thousands of inverse fb , </S>",
    "<S> the determination of the mass as well as ratios of leptonic decay branching ratios of these higgs bosons would also be possible . </S>"
