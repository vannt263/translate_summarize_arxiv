    "the first result of the calculus of variations ever discovered must have been the statement that the shortest path joining two points is a straight line segment .",
    "another classical variational problem consists in finding , amongst all simple closed plane curves of a given fixed length , one that encloses the largest possible area .",
    "it is well known since ancient times that the circle is the shape that encloses maximum area for a given length of perimeter .",
    "however , it was not until the eighteenth century that a systematic theory , the calculus of variations ( cov ) , began to emerge .",
    "a modern face to the cov is given by the theory of optimal control .",
    "economics is a source of interesting applications of the theory of calculus of variations and optimal control .",
    "classical examples include the optimal capital spending problem , optimal reservoir control , optimal production subject to royalty payment obligations , optimal maintenance and replacement policy , and optimal drug bust strategy @xcite .",
    "the following economics problem ( explained briefly here ) has motivated this paper @xcite .",
    "a standard feature of the theory of the firm is that a profit maximising firm facing a downward sloping demand curve reacts to an increase in marginal cost by reducing output and increasing price . in this context",
    ", it is well understood that a requirement to pay a flat - rate royalty on sales has just this effect of increasing marginal cost and thereby decreasing output while simultaneously increasing price .",
    "however , the effect of permitting the royalty to take on more general forms leads naturally to non - standard cov problems , and explains why this question has remained unaddressed to date @xcite .",
    "recently the effect of piecewise linear cumulative royalty schedules on the optimal intertemporal production policy , , an optimal economics control problem that does not fit into the classical class of variational problems , has been formulated @xcite .",
    "the economics problem lies in the area of repayable launch investment ( rli ) . for the purposes of this paper we will outline just the mathematical nature of the problem since the precise ( nonlinear ) economic details are of secondary importance here . consider the system in the time domain modelled by the differential equation @xmath2 with the endpoint state value @xmath0 at time @xmath3 unknown .",
    "we wish to determine the control function @xmath4 for @xmath5 $ ] that maximises the return @xmath6 = \\int_0^t f(t , y(t),u(t),y(t ) ) dt \\ , .\\ ] ] note that the integrand depends upon the _ a priori _ unknown final value @xmath0 .",
    "this class of problem is not contained within the classical class of variational problems and the present paper indicates how such problems may be solved .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : nec : cond ] we develop the necessary conditions for the extremising solution .",
    "the main idea is borrowed from malinowska and torres @xcite , where appropriate natural boundary conditions are proved for problems of the calculus of variations on time scales @xcite .",
    "we then consider two approaches to obtain the solution of a sample example with a continuous integrand @xmath7 ( section  [ sec : ex ] ) .",
    "the first approach considers the numerical shooting solution ( section  [ sec : na ] ) .",
    "the results obtained are then validated by symbolic algebra computations ( section  [ sec : sas ] ) .",
    "we finish with conclusions in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we begin by developing the necessary conditions for the extremising solution .",
    "let @xmath8 be a functional of the form @xmath9 = \\int_a^t f(t , y(t),y'(t),y(t ) ) dt\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is a smooth function and @xmath11 .",
    "we consider the problem of determining the functions @xmath12 such that @xmath13 $ ] has an extremum .",
    "an initial condition @xmath14 is imposed on @xmath15 , but @xmath0 is free .",
    "suppose that @xmath13 $ ] has an extremum at @xmath16 .",
    "we can proceed as lagrange did ( @xcite ) , by considering the value of @xmath8 at a nearby function @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a small parameter , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 . because @xmath0 is free",
    ", we do not require @xmath21 to vanish at @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath23 = \\int_a^t f(t,\\tilde{y}(t)+\\varepsilon h(t),\\tilde{y}'(t ) + \\varepsilon h'(t),\\tilde{y}(t)+\\varepsilon h(t ) ) dt \\ , .\\ ] ] a necessary condition for @xmath16 to be an extremizer is given by @xmath24 dt = 0 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath25 .",
    "integration by parts gives @xmath26_a^t - \\int_a^t \\frac{d}{dt } \\left(f_{y'}(\\cdots)\\right ) h(t ) dt \\ , .\\ ] ] because @xmath20 , the necessary condition ( [ eq : ft ] ) can be then written as @xmath27 h(t ) \\\\",
    "+ \\left[\\frac{f_{y'}\\left(t,\\tilde{y}(t),\\tilde{y}'(t ) , \\tilde{y}(t)\\right)}{t - a } + f_z(\\cdots)\\right ] h(t ) \\biggr\\ } dt\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] for all @xmath19 such that @xmath20 .",
    "in particular , equation ( [ eq : aft : ip ] ) holds for the subclass of functions @xmath19 that do vanish at @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the classical arguments apply , and therefore @xmath29 equation ( [ eq : aft : ip ] ) must be satisfied for all @xmath19 with @xmath20 , which includes functions @xmath21 that do not vanish at @xmath22 .",
    "consequently , equations ( [ eq : aft : ip ] ) and ( [ eq : el ] ) imply that @xmath30 h(t ) dt = 0\\\\ \\leftrightarrow h(t ) \\left ( f_{y'}\\left(t,\\tilde{y}(t),\\tilde{y}'(t ) , \\tilde{y}(t)\\right ) + \\int_a^t f_z(\\cdots ) dt \\right ) = 0 \\ , , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] that is , @xmath31 we remark that in the classical setting @xmath7 does not depend on @xmath0 , that is , @xmath32 .",
    "in that case ( [ new : nat : bc ] ) reduces to the well known natural boundary condition @xmath33 ( or , from an hamiltonian optimal control perspective , @xmath34 ) .",
    "we have just proved the following result :    [ thm : mr ] let @xmath35 and @xmath22 be given real numbers , @xmath36 . if @xmath16 is a solution of the problem @xmath37 = \\int_a^t f(t , y(t),y'(t),y(t ) ) dt \\longrightarrow \\textrm{extr } \\\\",
    "y(a ) = \\alpha \\quad ( y(t ) \\text { free } ) \\\\",
    "y(\\cdot ) \\in c^1 \\ , , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] then @xmath38 for all @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "moreover , @xmath40    from an optimal control perspective one has @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the hamiltonian multiplier .",
    "theorem  [ thm : mr ] asserts that the usual necessary optimality conditions ( the euler - lagrange equation @xcite or the pontryagin maximum principle @xcite ) hold for problem ( [ eq : p ] ) by substituting the classical transversality condition @xmath34 with @xmath43",
    "we consider an example that illustrates the new class of cov problem .",
    "it has the same form as the complicated nonlinear optimal intertemporal production policy problem . consider the ode system described by @xmath44 we wish to maximise @xmath45 = \\int_0^t f(t , y(t),u(t),z)\\ , dt\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is a continuous function .",
    "the initial known state is @xmath47 and final state value @xmath48 is free . in this example",
    "we set @xmath49 .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath50 and @xmath51 function @xmath7 does not depend on @xmath52 , and for an optimum ( maximum in this example ) , the costate satisfies @xmath53 the stationarity condition is @xmath54 and this yields @xmath55 from ( [ az ] ) @xmath56 holds , , @xmath57",
    "let us consider the necessary conditions ( nc ) that need to be satisfied . for the system of odes ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) with control ( [ a3 ] ) ,",
    "the known zero initial condition @xmath58 and a guessed initial value @xmath59 , we need to ensure that the natural boundary condition ( [ a4 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "we need to solve the two point boundary value problem .",
    "also we need to iterate the value of @xmath60 used in ( [ a3 ] ) to ensure that in fact the value @xmath60 equals the value obtained for @xmath61 at @xmath62 .",
    "when one has obtained convergence regarding the values @xmath0 used in ( [ a3 ] ) and @xmath1 ( [ a4 ] ) , then nc is satisfied and we should have the optimal solution .    use the newton shooting method with two guessed values @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "we desire @xmath65 , and @xmath66 as specified by equation ( [ a4 ] ) .",
    "when the program obtains results with these two equations holding to a very high degree of accuracy , the necessary conditions nc hold and we should have the optimal solution .",
    "we have solved the shooting method problem using and the highly accurate numerical recipes library routines @xcite :    \\(i ) we integrate the system @xmath67 , , the system of odes ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) , and @xmath68 @xmath69 the results are @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 perturbations of the optimal control @xmath4 by increasing and decreasing the value of @xmath4 at a single time instant yield smaller @xmath74 values .",
    "see figure  1 for results on state variable @xmath61 and control variable @xmath4 .    a completely different approach , using a nonlinear programming technique , was also used .",
    "this technique may be useful for the actual piecewise constant economics problem .",
    "we solved this problem using euler and runge - kutta discretisation , and an optimisation algorithm to solve for the unknown control variables @xmath75 at each time instant @xmath76 .",
    "we computed the nonlinear programming problem using ampl @xcite with the minos solver and neos @xcite . using 40 time steps yields a good approximation very similar to the optimal results",
    "obtained using the precise approach here described .",
    "consider the ode system ( [ a1 ] ) and the associated optimal control problem described by ( [ eq : functional ] ) and ( [ eq : lagrangean ] ) .",
