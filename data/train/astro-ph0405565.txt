    "recent observations of the high redshift ( @xmath4 ) quasar spectra from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the cosmic microwave background fluctuations from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( _ wmap _ ) combine to paint a complicated reionization picture ( @xcite ) . while it seems relatively secure to claim that the reionization process has begun at @xmath5 and ends at @xmath6 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , exactly when it starts and how it evolves are yet unclear , although the overall picture is consistent with a physically motivated double reionization model ( @xcite ) that was proposed before wmap released its reionization measurement .",
    "the conventional wisdom is that stars are primarily responsible for producing most of the ionizing photons .",
    "unavoidably , there is a transition epoch from metal - free population iii ( pop iii ) to metal - poor population ii ( pop ii ) stars at some high redshift ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is thought that pop iii stars may be much more massive than pop ii stars .",
    "this expectation is based on the physics of metal cooling .",
    "lack of metals in the gas at early times results in an absolute floor temperature of gas at @xmath7k , whereas a small but significant amount of metals would enable gas to cool down to @xmath8k .",
    "consequently , pop iii stars are expected to be much more massive than pop ii stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , how massive pop iii stars are remains unclear .",
    "while simulations have suggested that pop iii stars may be more massive than @xmath9 ( `` vary massive star '' , vms ; @xcite ) , @xcite argue that taking into account feedback processes would likely limit the mass of the pop iii stars to the range @xmath10 .",
    "observationally , the vms picture is advocated by @xcite and @xcite , based on the argument that the metal yield patterns from pair - instability supernova ( pisn ) explosion of vms progenitors @xcite are consistent with observations ( see also wasserburg & qian  2000 ; 2001 ) . on the other hand , @xcite argue that the general pattern in metal - poor halo stars , especially the fe - peak and @xmath11-process elements , favors the yield pattern of type ii supernovae ( snii ) with an initial mass function ( imf ) above 10 @xmath12 and without vms ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "other arguments based on observations such as metallicities of the intergalactic ( igm ) at @xmath13 in the ly@xmath14 forest @xcite and cosmic star formation history @xcite also favor a snii type imf . @xcite and @xcite argue that the observed metal abundance pattern are better matched by core - collapsed supernova with @xmath15 through pair - instability supernova explosion @xcite .",
    "it thus seems beneficial to explore possible differences between different imfs . in this _ letter _ , we investigate the issue of the transition from pop iii to pop ii .",
    "specifically , following @xcite , we note that the transition from pop iii to pop ii is dictated by efficiency of cooling by a limited number of species , in particular , c and o. thus , it is the amount of c and o , not necessarily the total amount of  metals \" , that determines the transition . while the ionizing photon production efficiency turns out to be quite comparable in both cases , either with a vms imf or a more normal top - heavy imf ( e.g. , @xcite ) , they have very different metal patterns in the exploded final products . in pisn case",
    "the supernova ejecta is enriched by @xmath14-elements , whereas the major products of snii are hydrogen and helium with a small amount of heavy elements ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the transition from pop iii to pop ii stars should occur at different times .",
    "we show that a normal top - heavy imf is preferred to vms and probably required if pop iii stars were to reionize the universe at high enough redshift .",
    "we first define @xmath16 as the baryon fraction that has been processed through pop iii stars , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are total baryonic mass and the baryonic mass in pop iii stars , respectively .",
    "we also define the total ionization photons ( @xmath20ev ) produced per unit mass of pop iii stars as @xmath21 . for completeness",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : photon ] the time - integrated ionization photons per solar mass emitted during the lifetime of a pop iii star vs. its initial mass @xmath22 , adopted from @xcite .",
    "the vertical dotted line at @xmath23 is to distinguish between pisn and snii . clearly , for most of the mass range ( @xmath24 ) , the ionizing photons produced during the lifetime of the star is @xmath25 .",
    "this lifetime - integrated number of ionizing photons varies only about a factor of less than 2 when the initial mass is @xmath26 .",
    "it is because the total ionizing photon production of a short - lifetime vms is boosted by its higher production rate .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that photon production rate could be important if the typical recombination time scale is shorter than the lifetime of pop iii stars .",
    "the typical lifetimes of a 200 and 25 @xmath27 pop iii stars are @xmath28 and @xmath29 yrs @xcite .",
    "the recombination time scale is roughly @xmath30 yrs at redshift @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the clumping factor of regions @xcite . while in general @xmath33",
    "is longer than the lifetime of pop iii stars , at some overdense regions when @xmath34 the lifetime of a small mass star could be longer than @xmath33 , and in this case more than 1 ionizing photon are necessary to ionize the entire igm .",
    "having this caution in mind , in the following we assume that all the pop iii stars produce about the same amount of ionizing photons in their lifetime and roughly 1 ionizing photon per atom is needed to reionize the universe . using relevant numbers and assuming a mean atom weight of @xmath35 , we find that the number of the ionizing photons per hydrogen atom produced , denoted as @xmath36 , is @xmath37    let us define @xmath38 as the yield of element @xmath39 , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the mass of element @xmath39 produced by the initial stellar mass @xmath22 . assuming metals produced by supernova explosion can be effectively transported out of the host halos and uniformly pollute the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , then the igm metallicity of element @xmath39 , @xmath42 , where @xmath16 is the baryon fraction defined above . substituting @xmath16 from eq .",
    "[ eq : nion ] , we can then relate the ionization photon per h atom , @xmath36 , to the igm metallicity of element @xmath39 , @xmath43 : @xmath44    zero - metallicity pop iii stars with different initial masses have distinctive pattern of final metal productions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for stars with initial masses",
    "@xmath45 , neutron stars are formed through type ii supernova explosion . the majority of the ejecta are hydrogen and helium , with small amount of heavy metals . between @xmath46 ,",
    "black holes form through direct collapse of the star . at @xmath47 ,",
    "the electron - positron pair instability starts to dominate , but if @xmath48 , an iron core will still be formed and eventually collapse to a black hole without any metal productions .",
    "when @xmath49 , the pulsation induced by the pair instability is so violent that one single pulse disrupts the entire star and eject abundant @xmath14-elements . at above",
    "@xmath50 again black holes will form .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath51 of a pop iii star that can be formed from accretion into primordial protostar was recently found by @xcite via three - dimensional numerical simulation .",
    "it is important to note that essentially all metals are produced for mass ranges of 10  40 @xmath12 and/or 140  260 @xmath12 .",
    "pop iii stars within these two mass ranges produce distinctive pattern of metals , which will have great impact on the important metal cooling agents , namely , c and o.    we study four types of imfs : two types for pisn and two types for type ii sn .",
    "an imf is defined as @xmath52 with @xmath53 @xmath54 the four types are : ( 1 ) pisn model 1 , with @xmath55 ; ( 2 ) pisn model 2 , @xmath56 ; ( 3 ) type ii supernova model 1 , with @xmath57 ; and ( 4 ) type ii supernova model 2 , with @xmath58 .",
    "model ( 2 ) is introduced to see how sensitive the metal yield of pisn model depends on various mass limits .",
    "model ( 4 ) is motivated by the suggestion of @xcite that the first stars should have masses between @xmath10 . to avoid the degeneracy between the imf index and mass limits we adopted a consistent imf index of @xmath59 among all the four models .    for each imf",
    "we compute the metal yield . as pointed out by @xcite metal cooling at low temperature ( @xmath60k )",
    "is dominated by fine - structure line cooling of and , we concentrate on the metal yield of c and o. the yield can be calculated through @xmath61 where the subscript @xmath39 represents c or o , and @xmath62 is defined as the ratio of the mass fraction of the element @xmath39 in solar units , in this way @xmath62 is one half of the production factors defined in @xcite . for the pisn type imf",
    "we use the production factors of @xcite .",
    "for snii type imf model 1 and 2 we adopt the production factors calculated from @xcite model z12a , z15a , ... and z30b , z35b , .... series , respectively .    with metal yield @xmath38 and ionizing photon production rate @xmath63",
    ", we can now compute the element metallicity @xmath64 as a function of ionizing photons per hydrogen atom through eq .",
    "[ eq : zigm ] .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : metal ] .",
    "the top and bottom panels show the oxygen and carbon metallicities , respectively .",
    "the metal abundance in this definition is relative to the solar value , i.e. , @xmath65 = \\log_{10 } ( n_{o}/n_h ) - \\log_{10 } ( n_{o}/n_h)_{\\odot}$ ] .",
    "the solid and dotted lines represent pisn model 1 and 2 , dashed and dot - dashed lines are for snii model 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the horizontal shadowed areas show the critical transition metallicities @xmath66 and their errors from @xcite , @xmath67_{crit } \\simeq -3.5\\pm0.1 $ ] and @xmath68_{crit } \\simeq -3.05\\pm0.2 $ ] , respectively .",
    "the free - fall time scale for gas clump is @xmath69 , and the critical transition metallicities are obtained by equating the cooling time at temperature @xmath70k ( below which metal cooling dominates ) to @xmath71 for a gas density of @xmath72@xmath73 ( @xcite ) .",
    "immediately , we see that the transition from pop iii to pop ii occurs much earlier in model 1 and 2 than in models 3 and 4 .",
    "we see that about @xmath74 ionizing photons per h atom are produced in pisn model 1 , @xmath75 photons in pisn model 2 , whereas @xmath76 ionizing photons per h atom is produced in sn ii model 1 and 2 .",
    "not all ionizing photons can escape into the igm , nor do the metals .",
    "metal enrichment of the igm may be expected to be inhomogeneous , which perhaps would yield a higher effective metal enrichment in star formation regions if galaxy formation is biased .",
    "the fact supernova explosions in the pisn ( model 1 ) may be more energetic than in the other two models may suggest that perhaps more metals could be transported to the igm in the former case .",
    "it thus seems improbable that pisn pop iii stars will be able to ionize the universe alone , unless ionizing photon escape fraction is @xmath77 and/or metal enrichment is very inefficient .",
    "based on the consideration of cooling due to c and o at low temperatures ( @xmath78k ) , we note that it may be expected that the transition from pop iii to pop ii stars should occur when @xmath79 ionizing photon per h atom is produced , if the imf is entirely vms .",
    "a factor of about @xmath1 more ionizing photons would be produced in the case with normal top - heavy imf ( e.g. , @xmath2 ) , when such a transition occurs .",
    "thus , it will be much more difficult , if not impossible , to achieve an earlier ( @xmath80 ) reionization in the former case .",
    "therefore , if future wmap data firm up the thomson optical depth to @xmath81 , one may be forced to adopt a more conventional top - heavy imf . if minihalos were largely responsible for producing ionizing photons at high redshift , then an imf with vms may be still viable , as the ionizing photon escape fraction from minihalos may well exceed @xmath82 , shown by the recent radiation hydrodynamic simulations ( @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that metals can efficiently get mixed with the general igm and adopted a simplified picture that metals produced by pop iii stars are uniformly distributed in the igm . in the pisn case @xcite found for a supernova explosion with an energy of @xmath83 ergs , at least 90% of metals can be effectively transported into surrounding igm .",
    "@xcite discussed a simplified vms imf ( all pop iii stars have mass of 200 @xmath27 and explode as pisn ) : they trace the star formation history and calculate the mean number of ionization photons per atom and the mean metalicity of the igm .",
    "their results are consistent with results from our pisn model 1 and 2 .",
    "the derived @xmath84 falls short of @xmath85 result when constrained by a critical metalicity of @xmath86=-3.3 $ ] , this is consistent with our conclusion that a vms imf may not be favored by recent @xmath85 result .",
    "however , metal mixing is most likely inhomogeneous , that could affect the transition from pop iii to pop ii stars ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the exact effect is , however , unclear , when coupled with spatially non - uniform galaxy and star formation .",
    "we emphasize that a conventional imf may not be the only way to alleviate the conflict between the metal yield of the pop iii stars and the number of ionization photons they produced .",
    "@xcite argued that most pop iii stars should collapse into black holes to avoid producing too much metals with added benefits of additional accretion produced energy ."
