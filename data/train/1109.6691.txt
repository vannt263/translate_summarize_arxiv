    "since the suggestion by matsui and satz  @xcite that suppressed production of @xmath0 in relativistic heavy - ion collisions could be a signature for produced qgp , there have been many experimental  @xcite and theoretical studies  @xcite on this very interesting phenomenon ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for a recent review .",
    "although their original idea was that the screening of color charges in the qgp would prohibit charm and anticharm quarks from forming the @xmath0 and thus suppress its production , lattice qcd calculations of the @xmath0 spectral function showed , on the other hand , that the @xmath0 could survive inside qgp up to the so - called dissociation temperature  @xcite .",
    "however , the dissociation temperature depends on how the @xmath0 spectral function is extracted from lattice data and it is not yet clear if it is far from the critical temperature  @xcite . studying @xmath0 suppression in relativistic heavy - ion collisions can thus provide not only a signature for the qgp but also a probe of its properties @xcite .",
    "a quantitative study of @xmath0 production in heavy - ion collisions is , however , complicated by their absorption in the initial cold nuclear matter and regeneration in the qgp . since the @xmath1 is a more strongly bound state of bottom and antibottom quarks than the @xmath0 , its production in heavy - ion collisions",
    "is expected to be less affected by initial cold nuclear matter effects .",
    "furthermore , the much smaller number of bottom quarks than charm quarks that is produced in heavy - ion collisions makes the contribution of regeneration from the qgp to @xmath1 production also less important .",
    "therefore , studying @xmath1 production in heavy - ion collisions would provide a cleaner probe of the properties of qgp and also the in - medium properties of bottomonia  @xcite .",
    "recently , the nuclear modification factor @xmath2 of the sum of bottomonia @xmath1(1s ) , @xmath1(2s ) and @xmath1(3s ) , defined by their yields relative to those from p+p collisions multiplied by the number of initial binary collisions , in au+au collisions at @xmath3 gev was measured by the star collaboration at rhic @xcite , while that of @xmath1(1s ) @xcite and the relative suppression of @xmath1(2s ) and @xmath1(3s ) to @xmath1(1s ) @xcite in pb+pb collisions at @xmath4 tev were measured by the cms collaboration at lhc . in both experiments ,",
    "the measured @xmath2 was seen to decrease with increasing centrality of collisions . in the present study ,",
    "we use the two - component model  @xcite , which was previously used for studying @xmath0 production in heavy - ion collisions , to show that these experimental results allow us to obtain useful information on the properties of bottomonia in qgp .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first briefly review in sec .",
    "[ two ] the two - component model for bottomonia production in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we then compare in sec .",
    "[ data ] the calculated nuclear modification factors of bottomonium from the model with experimental data .",
    "finally , a conclusion is given in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "in the two - component model , bottomonia are produced from both initial nucleon - nucleon hard scattering and regeneration in the produced qgp .",
    "the numbers of initially produced bottomonia are proportional to the number of binary collisions among nucleons in the two colliding nuclei .",
    "whether these bottomonia can survive after collisions depends on many effects from both the initial cold nuclear matter and the final hot partonic and hadronic matters .",
    "for the initial cold nuclear matter effect , the shadowing and the nuclear absorption effect are included .",
    "the shadowing is the modification of the parton distribution in a nucleus from that in a single nucleon . in this study",
    ", we use the eps09 package @xcite and assume that the effect is proportional to the path length of a parton in nucleus @xcite . using the experimental data on the average transverse momentum of @xmath1 @xcite , the ratios of gluon distribution function in a nucleus to that in a single nucleon at @xmath5 are 1.12 and 0.92 for collisions at rhic and lhc energies , respectively , with the ratio larger than one called the anti - shadowing . for the nuclear absorption cross section of bottomonium in cold nuclear matter , its value is about 4.3 mb at rhic based on the recently measured nuclear modification factor @xmath6 of midrapidity bottomonium in d+au collisions at rhic  @xcite .",
    "this value is larger than the value of 2.8 mb for the nuclear absorption cross section of charmonium in heavy - ion collisions at rhic  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear absorption cross section of bottomonia at lhc is , however , not known empirically . since the nuclear cross section of bottomonium is expected to decrease with increasing collisions energy , we take the value 4.3 mb as an upper limit at lhc and consider the two cases of 0 and 4.3 mb . for thermal dissociation of bottomonia , it includes the initial dissociation in the produced qgp of temperatures above their dissociation temperatures and the subsequent dissociation by quarks and gluons in the qgp and hadrons in the hadronic matter ( hg ) .    for the local initial temperature",
    ", we estimate it from the local entropy density @xmath7 $ ] @xcite in terms of the number densities of participants and binary collisions @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the number of participants ( binary collisions ) in the volume @xmath10 of the transverse area @xmath11 and @xmath12 being the initial thermalization time . for the value of @xmath12",
    ", we use 0.9 and 1.05 fm / c from the viscous hydrodynamics @xcite for au+au collisions at @xmath3 gev at rhic and pb+pb collisions at @xmath4 tev at lhc , respectively . the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 are , respectively , 0.11 and 18.7 for rhic and 0.15 and 27.0 for lhc from fitting measured charged particle multiplicities  @xcite . with the quasiparticle model of three flavors for the equation of state of qgp and the resonance gas model for that of hg  @xcite , the initial maximum temperatures are 324 and 390 mev and mean temperatures are 269 and 311 mev for central collisions at rhic and lhc , respectively .",
    "after initial thermalization , a schematic viscous hydrodynamics @xcite is then used to describe the expansion of the hot dense matter with the specific shear viscosity @xmath15 taken to be 0.16 and 0.2 for the qgp at rhic and lhc @xcite , respectively , and 0.8 for the hg @xcite .",
    "the thermal dissociation by partons in the qgp or hadrons in the hg of bottomonia that have survived from initial dissociations is described by the rate equation for the number @xmath16 of bottomonia of type @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the longitudinal proper time and @xmath20 is the thermal decay width of bottomonia .",
    "the number of equilibrated bottomonia of type @xmath17 is given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is its number density in grandcanonical ensemble ; @xmath23 is the fraction of qgp in the mixed phase and is 1 in the qgp ; and @xmath24 is the step function with @xmath25 being the dissociation temperature of bottomonia of type @xmath17 .",
    "the chemical and kinetic off - equilibrium of bottom quarks in the qgp is included through their fugacity @xmath26 and relaxation factor @xmath27 , respectively , with the former obtained from the conservation of bottom flavor @xcite and the latter defined as @xmath28 $ ] where @xmath29 is the relaxation time of bottom quarks . with @xmath30 @xcite and @xmath314 fm / c for charm quarks @xcite",
    ", the relaxation time for bottom quarks is about 14 fm / c .",
    "we note that the second term on the right hand of eq.([rate ] ) takes into account the regeneration of bottomonia from bottom and antibottom quarks in the qgp .        for the thermal decay widths of bottomonia in qgp",
    ", we calculate them up to the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) @xcite . while in the leading order ( lo ) a bottomonium is dissociated by absorbing a thermal gluon , in the nlo it is dissociated by the gluon emitted from a quark or gluon in the qgp .",
    "the squared invariant amplitudes for these processes are the same as those given in ref .",
    "@xcite for charmonia except the heavy quark mass and can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in term of the resulting bottomonium dissociation cross section @xmath32 , the thermal decay width of a bottomonium",
    "is given by @xmath33 where @xmath17 denotes the quarks and gluons in the qgp ; @xmath22 is the number density of parton species @xmath17 in grand canonical ensemble ; and @xmath34 is the relative velocity between the scattering bottomonium and parton . for the thermal width in the mixed phase , it is taken to be a linear combination of those in the qgp and the hg , i.e. , @xmath35 , where @xmath23 is the fraction of qgp in the mixed phase . for the dissociation cross section of @xmath1(1s ) in the hadron gas ( hg ) , we use the factorization formula @xcite and assume that those of excited bottomonia are proportional to their squared radii . in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ widths ] , we show the thermal decay widths of bottomonia in qgp calculated with their masses and radii in free space , i.e. , 9.5 gev and 0.23 fm , 9.97 gev and 0.59 fm , 10.19 gev and 0.95 fm , 9.9 gev and 0.46 fm , and 10.25 gev and 0.82 fm for @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , respectively , obtained from the cornell potential with the vacuum screening mass @xmath410.18 gev  @xcite . these thermal decay widths of bottomonia are appreciable and increase with increasing temperature .",
    "we note that the thermal decay widths of bottomonia in hg are significantly smaller than those in qgp .",
    "to include medium effects on the properties of bottomonia in qgp , we consider the modification of the potential energy between bottom and antibottom quarks due to the debye screening of color charges .",
    "this is achieved by using the screened cornell potential @xcite : @xmath42-\\frac{\\alpha}{r}e^{-\\mu(t ) r } \\label{cornell}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the screening mass @xmath45 depends on temperature , and we use the one given in pqcd , i.e. , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are numbers of colors and light quark flavors , respectively .",
    "we note that compared to results from the lattice qcd calculations for a heavy quark and antiquark pair in the qgp @xcite , this potential is closer to their internal energy at high temperature but to their free energy at low temperature .",
    "the screened cornell potential thus interpolates smoothly the expected temperature - dependent potential between heavy quark and antiquark  @xcite .",
    "the binding energies and radii of bottomonia in the qgp can be obtained by solving the resulting schrdinger equation for the bottom and anti - bottom quark pair .",
    "taking their masses to be @xmath49 4.746 gev @xcite and the qcd coupling constant @xmath50 as in our previous study of @xmath0 suppression in heavy - ion collisions @xcite , the results are shown in the upper and lower panels of fig . [ properties ] .",
    "it is seen that the dissociation temperatures of @xmath1(1s ) , @xmath1(2s ) , @xmath1(3s ) , @xmath51(1p ) and @xmath51(2p ) are 4.0 , 1.67 , 1.12 , 1.51 and 1.09 @xmath52 , respectively , and their radii increase with increasing temperature .",
    "the thermal decay widths of bottomonia obtained with their in - medium binding energies and radii are shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ widths ] , and they increase with temperature and diverge at their dissociation temperatures . compared to those obtained with binding energies and radii in free space , medium effects enhance the widths significantly .",
    "we note that the inclusion of thermal decay widths of heavy quarkonia effectively takes into account the imaginary part of the potential energy between heavy quark and antiquark at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "to calculate the nuclear modification factor of bottomonia in heavy - ion collisions requires information on their numbers produced in p+p collisions at same energy .",
    "since the numbers of bottomonia produced in p+p collisions at lhc are not available , we use in the present study those of @xmath1(1s ) , @xmath1(2s ) and @xmath1(3s ) from the experimental data in p+@xmath53 collisions at @xmath54 tev measured by the cdf collaboration at the fermilab @xcite , and those of @xmath51(1p ) and @xmath51(2p ) from their contributions to @xmath1(1s ) @xcite based on the branching ratios of about 0.24 and 0.13 , respectively . for p+p collisions at rhic ,",
    "the numbers of bottomonia were not individually measured , so we use @xmath55 @xcite , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are , respectively , the branching ratio and differential cross section in rapidity for @xmath58 , and assume their relative abundances are the same as those at the lhc . for the initial number of bottom quark pairs in determining the fugacity of bottom flavor , it is obtained from @xmath59 for rhic @xcite and @xmath60 in the rapidity range @xmath61 from the cdf collaboration @xcite for lhc . also , we need the contribution of excited bottomonia to @xmath36 in p+p collisions at same energy .",
    "since this has not been measured , we use the information obtained from p+p collisions at @xmath62 tev by the cdf collaboration at the fermilab  @xcite as they are known to be essentially independent of the collision energy @xcite , i.e. , the contributions from @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 to @xmath65 are taken to be 27.1 , 10.5 , 10.7 and 0.8 % , respectively . the resulting nuclear modification factors ( @xmath66 ) of bottomonia obtained without the cold nuclear effect in au+au collisions at @xmath3 gev at rhic and in pb+pb collisions at @xmath4 gev at lhc",
    "are shown in fig .",

    "the solid line is obtained without the cold nuclear matter effect , while the upper dotted line includes only shadowing effect and the lower dotted line includes both the shadowing and the nuclear absorption effect .",
    "it is seen that because of the large experimental errors , results from our model with and without the cold nuclear matter effect all can describe the data for all centralities from the rhic .    for pb+pb collisions at @xmath4 tev at lhc ,",

    ", these results agree with the data for both peripheral ( 20 - 100% ) and most central ( 0 - 10% ) collisions . for midcentral ( 10 - 20% ) collisions , our model significantly underestimates the measured @xmath2 .",

    "we note that most of the suppression of @xmath1(1s ) comes from those of its excited states , as seen from the results shown in fig .",
    "[ components ] . also , the contribution from regeneration the the @xmath2 of bottomonia is less than 1% at both rhic and lhc and for all centralities as a result of the small number of bottom quarks and the much longer bottom quark relaxation time than the lifetime of produced qgp . for comparison , the @xmath66 s for the case without medium effects on bottomonia",

    "this is also the case for heavy ion collisions at the lhc except for midcentral collisions where the result obtained without medium effects can better describe the experimental data . it is not clear if this indicates a change of the bottomonia suppression mechanism in midcentral collisions .",
    "improved experimental data are essential for resolving this puzzle .",
    "in conclusion , using the two - component model @xcite that includes both initial production from nucleon - nucleon hard scattering and regeneration from produced quark - gluon plasma , we have studied bottomonia production in heavy - ion collisions at rhic and lhc by including the medium effects on the thermal properties of bottomonia and their dissociation cross sections . with the expansion dynamics of produced hot dense matter described by a schematic viscous hydrodynamics and including the thermal dissociation of bottomonia as well as the regeneration of bottomonia by using a rate equation",
    ", our model describes successfully the experimental data from rhic and reasonably those from lhc on bottomonia suppression .",
    "our results indicate that the contribution of regenerated bottomonia is small .",
    "we have also studied the cold nuclear matter effect due to the shadowing or anti - shadowing of the parton distribution function in the nucleus and the nuclear absorption of bottomonia on their @xmath2 .",
    "although the anti - shadowing effect at rhic enhances the @xmath2 , the nuclear absorption reduces it .",
    "present experimental data at rhic are , however , not accurate enough to differentiate these effects . for the @xmath2 of bottomonia in heavy - ion collisions at lhc ,",
    "the experimental data are found to be better described by the absence of nuclear absorption , consistent with the expected decreasing effect of nuclear absorption with increasing collision energy .",
    "furthermore , the present study shows that the inclusion of medium effects on bottomonia is essential for describing the experimental observations at rhic",
    "aw well as at lhc except for midcentral collisions where results without medium effects can better describe the data .",
