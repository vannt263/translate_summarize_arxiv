    "this is in line with @xmath28sr results and is reminiscent of the behavior in several frustrated and low - dimensional magnetic systems,@xcite where short - range magnetic correlations typically emerge at temperatures that are significantly elevated compared to the magnetic ordering temperature.@xcite in particular , such correlations introduce a distribution of local magnetic fields that effectively broadens the line and potentially influences the line shift .",
    "we note that in some highly frustrated ( kagome ) systems the broadening of the nmr line with decreasing temperature has been ascribed to a broad distribution of local susceptibilities induced by nonmagnetic defects.@xcite however , in these materials the concentration of defects is high , typically affecting @xmath265% of the magnetic sites , i.e. , orders of magnitude more than in our crystals , where we found no trace of defects / impurities by any experimental technique .",
    "hence , the defect scenario in ftoc is highly unlikely .",
    "finally , we stress that short - range correlations were detected also in ftob by neutron diffraction as well as by @xmath28sr at @xmath64@xmath8150k.@xcite    below @xmath24 all spectral lines abruptly broaden and develop a box - like shape , indicative of a distribution of local magnetic fields or efg encountered in the ic systems,@xcite as found in ftob.@xcite the signal at @xmath75=1mhz is now almost twice as broad as the rest of the lines [ fig[nmr](a ) ] .",
    "in addition , on cooling below 12k this signal retains the box - like shape , while the rest of the lines develop a triangular form .",
    "hence it must correspond to a nucleus , which has a different local environment , either due to a different efg tensor and/or because of a peculiar distribution of local magnetic fields.@xcite at 4k the spectrum changes even more and seems to be composed of four broad overlapping lines , centered at the paramagnetic positions .",
    "this must be related to the @xmath25 transition , even though its presence above 7 t is not clear from the specific heat data .    to clarify which line corresponds to",
    "which cl site , we point out that in ftob br@xmath0 has much smaller efg than br@xmath5,@xcite implying that the signal with the smallest @xmath82 corresponds to cl@xmath0 .",
    "we thus ascribe the sharp line at @xmath75=210khz to the central transition ( 1/2@xmath831/2 ) of the cl@xmath0 site , while the three weak lines must be the satellite transitions ( @xmath843/2@xmath83@xmath841/2 ) of cl@xmath0 and cl@xmath5 .",
    "moreover , below @xmath24 the line with the shift of @xmath75=1mhz shows distinctly different behavior from the rest , indicating that it corresponds to cl@xmath5 , while the two with @xmath75=@xmath85 and 1.5mhz correspond to cl@xmath0 .",

    "this , on the other hand , indicates different strengths of the magnetic interactions and probably reflects the difference in the core polarization hyperfine fields of the br@xmath12 and the cl@xmath12 ions .      to determine the magnetic ordering in ftoc we conducted neutron diffraction experiments on a single - crystal sample .",

    "we find that all significant changes close to @xmath25 are associated with the o@xmath5 atom . in fig.[x - ray - all](c ) we show temperature dependences of the distances between the o@xmath5 and the neighboring fe and te atoms that it binds ( fig.[o1-struc ] ) .",
    "all other changes of the interatomic distances within the crystal layer are much smaller ( not shown ) , as they are below our experimental sensitivity .",
    "the fact that the o@xmath5-fe@xmath0 and the o@xmath5-te@xmath8 distances exhibit significantly larger changes than the o@xmath5-fe@xmath5 one implies that the o@xmath5 atom is actually rotating around the fe@xmath5 one ( fig.[o1-struc ] ) .",
    "this reflects also in the angles between the o@xmath5 and the neighboring o and fe atoms shown in fig.[x - ray - all](d ) .",
    "in particular , the changes of the o@xmath5-fe@xmath0-o@xmath157 and the fe@xmath5-o@xmath5-fe@xmath0 angles are larger than that of the o@xmath5-fe@xmath5-o@xmath8 one , which further implies that the axis of the o@xmath5 rotation is close to the fe@xmath5-o@xmath8 direction .",
    "since changes of other interatomic angles appear to be much smaller ( not shown ) , the observed rotation most likely applies to the o@xmath5 atom alone and does not involve the whole fe@xmath5-o octahedron .",
    "we thus suggest that this rotation is a direct response to the lone - pair redistribution on the te@xmath8 ion .    [ ! ]   surrounding and assumed direction ( marked by black arrow ) of the o@xmath5 shift on heating through the @xmath25 transition.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "at first sight , the only difference between the ftoc system investigated here and its isostructural relative ftob is the species of the halogen ion .",
    "since halogen ions are located in - between the feteo layers , they mostly affect the interlayer distance .",
    "the dominant intralayer magnetic exchange interactions in the two systems are thus expected to be comparable and should lead to similar magnetic orders .",
    "nevertheless , the difference in the interlayer distance may significantly influence the me coupling , as te@xmath6 lone - pair electrons , which are involved in the fe - o - te - o - fe magnetic exchange pathway and most probably carry the electric polarization,@xcite protrude into the interlayer space.@xcite following , we summarize our main findings and discuss how they comply with the above assumptions .",
    "first , we stress that we find a finite ferroelectric polarization and clear evidences of the me effect , in contrast to the prior far - infrared study@xcite that could not detect any link between electrodynamic response and magnetic ordering .",
    "the observed dielectric response may be explained in the following way . at @xmath24 ,",
    "small electric dipoles develop along the @xmath23 axis , inducing a concurrent step in @xmath143 [ fig.[pol](b ) ] .",
    "however , since @xmath151 for @xmath149 is flat down to @xmath25 [ fig.[pol](a ) ] , these dipoles are most likely ordered antiparallelly , leading to the antiferroelectric polarization @xmath158 . when @xmath150 is applied , @xmath158 bends towards @xmath19 , resembling a finite net polarization already in the ht - ic phase [ fig.[pol](a ) ] . at @xmath25 ,",
    "a `` metaelectric '' transition occurs , where antiferroelectrically ordered dipoles flop and form a ferroelectric arrangement pointing along @xmath23 , @xmath159 , reflecting as a rapid increase of @xmath141 for @xmath149 and a sharp anomaly in @xmath143 . on further cooling ,",
    "@xmath151 for @xmath160 almost exactly follows the response for @xmath149 , suggesting that spontaneously induced electric polarization @xmath159 rotates towards @xmath19 when @xmath160 is applied .    to address the magnetic behavior of the fete@xmath0o@xmath9 system , we first highlight both characteristic temperatures , i.e. , the curie - weiss ( @xmath27 ) and the nel ( @xmath24 ) temperature , which are in ftoc @xmath2625% higher than in ftob.@xcite in the case of a non - frustrated layered system , @xmath161 is related to both , intralayer as well as interlayer , exchange interactions,@xcite whereas @xmath27 is determined solely by dominant intralayer interactions . on the contrary , in frustrated systems",
    ", @xmath161 is determined by main competing interactions@xcite and should thus scale proportionally to @xmath27 .",
    "the fact that the substitution of the halogen ion , i.e. , the change of the interlayer distance , induces similar relative changes of both characteristic temperatures suggests that in ftoc / ftob frustration dominates and overcomes the layer - type effects .",
    "this is in agreement with antiferromagnetic resonance and density functional theory study , revealing a quasi one - dimensional character of the system.@xcite nonetheless , the reduction of the interlayer distance may still cause higher - order effects and thus influence the magnetic anisotropy and/or the me coupling .",
    "indeed , the two systems exhibit distinctly different magnetic anisotropies , as their flat elliptical envelopes are almost perpendicular to each other in both lro phases [ fig.[structure ] and tables[tab1],[tab2]].@xcite this further reflects in the magnetic - field dependence of @xmath25 , which is in both systems reduced when field is applied along @xmath19 ( fig.[cp]),@xcite but the effect is more significant in ftoc .",
    "the reason for the observed response is that the magnetic field prefers antiferromagnetically ordered magnetic moments ( forming a cycloid ) to point perpendicular to it , making the lt - ic ordering with the dominant orientation of the magnetic moments along ( 1@xmath850 ) unfavorable.@xcite the larger decrease of @xmath25 in ftoc , on the other hand , complies with the orientation of the ht - ic elliptical envelope that is in ftoc perpendicular to @xmath19 , whereas in ftob the normal of the ellipse points towards @xmath23 .",
    "such a pronounced anisotropic behavior is rather surprising , as the magnetic fe@xmath3 ion in the high - spin @xmath4=5/2 state has an almost isotropic orbital ground state ( @xmath162=0 ) , for which crystal - field anisotropy is expected to be small .",
    "distinctly different anisotropies of ftoc and ftob , therefore , imply that the two systems are highly sensitive to the weak fe@xmath3 magnetic anisotropy .",
    "this is most likely due to the geometric frustration , responsible for the complex magnetic ground state , which is probably very close to being degenerated and thus also very sensitive to small perturbations .    due to the me coupling ,",
    "the magnetic anisotropies are most likely responsible also for the discrepancy between the dielectric responses of the two systems .",
    "in particular , the measured electric polarization in ftoc is in the lt - ic phase equal for @xmath150 and @xmath149 , whereas in ftob the response for @xmath150 is almost an order of magnitude weaker than for @xmath149 .",
    "this may indicate that in ftoc the spontaneously induced net electric polarization @xmath163 can be easily rotated by the external electric field , while in ftob it is almost completely insensitive to it .",
    "similarly , finite @xmath141 for @xmath150 above @xmath25 may result from a potentially existing antiferroelectric component @xmath158 , which is bend towards @xmath19 due to the applied electric field .",
    "our results thus hint that the electric polarization in ftoc is significantly less rigid than in ftob and can be easily rotated within the @xmath97 plane by the external electric field , potentially affecting also the magnetic ordering .",
    "this further complies with the magnetic - field dependence of @xmath25 , which indicates that anisotropies in ftoc are weaker than in ftob .    finally , we look at the me coupling at the microscopic scale . in contrast to ftob ,",
    "crystal - lattice changes at @xmath25 are in ftoc much more distinct and clearly indicate the shift of the o@xmath5 atom .",
    "we stress here that o@xmath5 is bridging @xmath164 fe - o - fe as well as the @xmath165 fe - o - te - o - fe exchange interactions,@xcite from which @xmath164 was identified as the strongest interaction in ftob , while @xmath165 includes te@xmath8  the only te@xmath6 ion showing a noticeable shift in ftob.@xcite moreover , @xmath165 was found to have very strong influence on the electric polarization.@xcite since o@xmath5 is involved in a strong exchange interaction as well as it is attached to the te@xmath6 ion , which has easily polarizable lone - pair electrons , the crystallographic changes at @xmath25 ( fig.[x - ray - all ] ) suggest that the o@xmath5 atom is the source of the me effect in ftoc / ftob .",
    "a broad set of experimental methods was used to investigate magnetic and dielectric response of the ftoc system .",
    "we find that the system is multiferroic and is in many aspects very similar to its isostructural relative ftob .",
    "in particular , it exhibits two ic magnetically ordered states with very similar elliptical cycloidal magnetic orders and nearly the same dominant orientations as in ftob . however , the cycloidal planes are substantially tilted , i.e. , the one in ftoc is almost perpendicular to the one in ftob .",
    "since the only clear crystallographic difference between the two systems involves the interlayer distance , the observed response is ascribed to the geometric frustration .",
    "the latter most likely amplifies the effects of otherwise subtle structural differences , which are probably responsible for the variation of the magnetic anisotropies as well as for the different responses of the electric polarization to the applied electric field . on the microscopic level",
    ", however , the me mechanism seems to involve o@xmath5 , which bridges the main exchange interaction as well as it is attached to the te@xmath6 ion , which has easily polarizable lone - pair electrons that perturb into the interlayer spacing .",
    "hence , lone - pair electrons may be affected by distortions of the exchange bridges through magnetostriction process as well as by a variation of the interlayer distance , which can thus both influence the response of the electric polarization .",
    "finally , the observed persistent spin dynamics yet again confirms that this phenomenon is intrinsic to amplitude - modulated magnetic structures .",
