    "predicting a protein three dimensional structure from its sequence is equivalent to reproducing a three dimensional structure from one dimensional information encoded in its sequence . from such a viewpoint ,",
    "there are many studies that try to reconstruct three dimensional structures from one dimensional information such as contact numbers and the principal eigenvector of a contact matrix @xcite .",
    "an important question is not only what kind of one dimensional information is needed to reconstruct protein structures but also why such information is critical to reconstruct protein structures .",
    "let us think about a distance matrix each element of which is equal to distance between atoms or residues specified by its column and row .",
    "information contained in the distance matrix is equivalent with the specification of three - dimensional coordinates of each atom / residue , except that a mirror image of the native structure can not be excluded in distance information .",
    "reconstructing a distance matrix from one - dimensional vectors requires in principle the specification of all eigenvectors as well as eigenvalues . in other words , for an @xmath2 matrix , @xmath3 @xmath3-dimensional vectors are required .",
    "however , protein s particular characteristics may allow the reconstruction of a distance matrix with fewer one - dimensional vectors .    a contact matrix whose element is equal to one for contacting atom / residue pairs or zero for no - contacting atom / residue pairs or more generally a value between one and zero representing the degree of contact is a simplification of a distance matrix with two categories , contact or non - contact for the distance of atom / residue pairs , but keeps almost all information needed to reconstruct three - dimensional structures of proteins . in the case of a contact matrix consisting of discrete values , one and zero , for residues , porto et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the contact map of the native structure of globular proteins can be reconstructed starting from the sole knowledge of the contact map s principal eigenvector , and the reconstructed contact map allow in turn for the accurate reconstruction of the three - dimensional structure .",
    "a vector of contact numbers , which is defined as the number of atoms or residues in contact with each atom / residue in a protein , is another type of one - dimensional vector that is often used as a one - dimensional representation of proteins structures @xcite , and may be similar to but not the same as the principal eigenvector of a contact matrix .",
    "kabakiolu et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that the number of feasible protein conformations that satisfy the constraint of a contact number for each residue is very limited .",
    "a question is why the principal eigenvector of a contact matrix and a contact number vector contain significant information of protein structures . here",
    ", we consider what properties of contact matrices are induced by pairwise contact interactions for native proteins to be the lowest energy conformations .",
    "for simplicity , a total conformational energy is assumed to consist of pairwise interactions over all atom or residue pairs .",
    "it is further assumed that the pairwise interaction can be expressed as a product of a conformation - dependent ( @xmath0-dependent ) factor and a sequence - dependent ( @xmath4-dependent ) factor ; the @xmath4-dependent factor corresponds to an energy parameter specific to a given pair of atom / residues .",
    "here we call a matrix of @xmath0-dependent factor a generalized contact matrix or even simply a contact matrix ( @xmath0-matrix ) , and call a matrix of @xmath4-dependent factor a generalized contact energy matrix or even simply contact energy matrix ( @xmath1-matrix ) .",
    "a simple linear algebra indicates that such a total energy function is bounded by the lowest value corresponding to the total energy for a @xmath0-matrix in which all pairs with lower contact energies than a certain threshold are in contact .",
    "such a lower bound is achieved if and only if proteins are ideal to have the so - called go - like potential @xcite .",
    "the go - like potential is defined as one in which interaction energies between native contacts are always lower than those between non - native contacts .",
    "real pairwise interactions in proteins could nt be the go - like potential .",
    "in other words , real proteins could not achieve this lowest bound of a pairwise potential because of atom / residue connectivities and steric hindrance that are not included in this type of total energy function .",
    "how should they approach to the lowest bound as closely as possible ?",
    "the lowest bound can be approached by making the singular vectors of @xmath0-matrix parallel to the corresponding singular vectors of @xmath1-matrix with the same value of the singular values .",
    "also , in the lowest bound a contact number vector tends to be parallel to the principal eigenvectors of @xmath0-matrix and of @xmath1-matrix . the most effective way would be to first make the principal singular vector of @xmath0-matrix parallel to that of @xmath1-matrix .",
    "a similar strategy was used to recognize protein structures by three - dimensional threading of protein sequences @xcite .",
    "bastolla et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the principal eigenvector of a contact matrix must be correlated with that of a contact energy matrix , if the free energy of a conformation folded into a contact map is approximated by a pairwise contact potential .",
    "it was shown that the correlation coefficients of these two principal eigenvectors are actually statistically significant in protein folds . however , unlike their analyses the lowest bound of the total energy indicates the @xmath1-matrix to be singular - decomposed with a constant term that corresponds to the threshold energy to separate native contacts from non - native ones .",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath1-matrix may depend on the value of the additional constant .",
    "based on the indication above , we have analyzed the relationships between the principal eigenvectors of @xmath0-matrix and of @xmath1-matrix and contact number vector by examining the inner product of the two vectors .",
    "a statistical contact potential @xcite estimated from protein crystal structures is used to evaluate pairwise residue - residue interactions in proteins .",
    "182 representatives of single domain proteins from each family in the scop version 1.69 database @xcite are used to analyze the relationship between the principal eigenvectors of native @xmath0- and of @xmath1-matrices and the contact number vector .",
    "results show that the inner product of both the principal eigenvectors has a maximum at a certain value of the threshold energy for contacts , and that there are parallel tendencies between both the principal eigenvectors and contact number vector .",
    "it is worth noting that the principal eigenvector of native @xmath0-matrix corresponds to the lower frequency normal modes of the native structure of protein .",
    "in addition , the spectral representation of the contact and contact energy matrices reveals that pairwise residue - residue interactions , which depends only on the types of interacting amino acids but not on other residues in a protein , are insufficient and other interactions including residue connectivities and steric hindrance are needed to make native structures the unique lowest energy conformations .",
    "* basic assumptions and conventions *    we first assume that the total conformational energy of a protein with conformation @xmath0 and amino acid sequence @xmath4 of @xmath3 units can be approximated as the sum of pairwise interaction energies between the units . here",
    "a single unit may consist of an atom or a residue , although in most cases we treat a residue as a unit .",
    "we further assume that each pairwise interaction term can be expressed as a product of a @xmath0-dependent factor and a @xmath4-dependent factor .",
    "the @xmath0-dependent factor represents the degree to which a pair of units are in contact , while the @xmath4-dependent factor represents an interaction energy for a contacting pair of units . in other words ,",
    "the total conformational energy is assumed to be approximated as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the @xmath4-dependent term and @xmath0-dependent term for the pairwise interaction energy between the @xmath8 and @xmath9th units , respectively .",

    "the @xmath4-dependent term @xmath6 can include not only two - body interactions but multi - body effects as a mean - field , that is , not only depends on the type of a unit pair but on the entire protein sequence .",
    "we call the matrix @xmath14 as a generalized contact matrix or @xmath0-matrix for short .",
