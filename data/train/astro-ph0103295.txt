    "this has led to the study of the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) at different positions within a galaxy , allowing the kinematical structure to be tightly constrained ( e.g. , franx & illingworth 1988 , hereafter fi88 ; bender 1990 , hereafter b90 ; rix & white 1992 , hereafter rw92 ; van der marel & franx 1993 , hereafter vdmf93 ; bender , saglia & gerhard 1994 , hereafter bsg94 , van der marel et al . 1994 , hereafter vdm94a , fisher et  al .",

    "the orbital structure of a galaxy is a fossil record of its evolutionary history .",
    "however , there is a degeneracy between changes in mass - to - light ratio and velocity dispersion anisotropy that limits the analysis of rotation and dispersion measurements alone ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) . to recover the mass density distribution of a given galaxy requires at least an accurate determination of the velocity dispersion anisotropy through the losvd .",
    "a full determination of the galaxy dynamics would require the measurement of surface brightness profiles and is beyond the scope of this work but an accurate measurement of the losvd is an important step in achieving this ( e.g. , van der marel et  al .",
    "1994 , hereafter vdm94b ; saglia et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "to a first approximation , elliptical galaxies are believed to be relaxed dynamical systems and the distribution of stellar velocities has been assumed to be maxwellian producing approximately gaussian profiles . however , within a number of ellipticals non - gaussian losvds have been measured .",
    "for example , see figure  [ 5582mj_bf ] for losvds measured in ngc5582 at various radii .",
    "the non - gaussian losvds led to the detection of multiple component structures in ellipticals , such as kinematically - decoupled cores ( fi88 ; jedrzejewski & schechter 1988 , hereafter js88 ) , and central disks ( rw92 ; van den bosch et al .",
    "it has been demonstrated that under the assumption of gaussian losvds , the measurement of both rotation velocity and velocity dispersion can be incorrect by 10% or more ( vdmf93 ) .    to improve on the earlier measurements , more general parameterizations of the losvd",
    "have been tested and have been found to provide a superior description of the galaxy kinematical structure ( rw92 ; vdmf93 ; kuijken & merrifield 1993 ; zhao & prada 1996 ) . here",
    "galaxy kinematics are measured using the fourier correlation quotient ( fcq ) method of b90 .",
    "this method is considerably less sensitive to template - mismatching than traditional fourier methods and allows the measurement of the full losvd .",
    "the losvd is then parameterized as a gauss - hermite series expansion ( vdmf93 ) including the higher order terms @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "= 8.3truecm = 8.3truecm    the galaxy sample studied here consists mostly of low - luminosity ellipticals ( hereafter lles ) .",
    "evidence has grown steadily over the past 15 years that lles may be very different from the more luminous giant ellipticals , both in their kinematical behaviour ( davies et  al .",
    "1983 , hereafter defis83 ; bender & nieto 1990 ; rix et  al .",
    "1999 ) and the properties of their stellar populations ( e.g. faber et  al . 1992 ) . as isotropic rotators ( defis83 ) ,",
    "lles are more easily modelled than the giant ellipticals which are believed to be supported by velocity dispersion anisotropy .",
    "furthermore , the lower velocity dispersion broadening of lles enables the higher - orders of the losvd to be measured more accurately than for the more luminous ellipticals , provided that data of sufficiently high spectral resolution and signal - to - noise ratio ( hereafter s / n ) can be obtained .",

    "the ratio of @xmath9 to @xmath10 is plotted against @xmath18 for each galaxy .",
    "we note that there is a weak trend such that galaxies with larger ratios of @xmath19 have on average larger values of @xmath18 .",
    "this suggests that greater rotational support may be related to larger losvd asymmetries . in figure [ kin_typ](b ) it is shown that the largest values of @xmath18 are measured for galaxies with intermediate values of @xmath20 .",
    "losvd asymmetries may be more common for these galaxies . a larger sample is needed to confirm this suggestion .",
    "we have demonstrated in section  [ sec : charpar ] that for our sample of lles the _ global _ kinematic parameters such as @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath21 are consistent with the predictions for a simple oblate isotropic rotator model .    in general",
    ", however , we find a wide range of complex kinematical behaviour in our sample .",
    "there is a wide range of velocity dispersion gradients with radius .",
    "some galaxies , such as ngc3377 , show a steep decline , whereas others , such as ngc4551 , have a rather shallow profile .",
    "central decreases in @xmath2 are measured for three galaxies for the major and minor axes ( ngc4387 , ngc4478 and ngc4551 ) , and two galaxies ( ngc3608 and ngc4458 ) are found to have kinematically - decoupled cores ( kdcs ) .",
    "significant asymmetric line - of - sight velocity distributions , parameterized by the gauss - hermite coefficient @xmath0 , are measured for 13 low - luminosity ellipticals .",
    "these asymmetries are found mainly for radii close to the galaxy centre , and suggest that we are detecting the motion of two or more components of different kinematical properties in at least some of the low - luminosity ellipticals .",
    "the losvds along the minor axis are generally consistent with a gaussian shape .",
    "only a few galaxies show significant or terms . in the cases where",
    "non - gaussian losvds are detected this can be explained by isophote twisting such that our slit does not follow the exact location of the kinematic minor axis .",
    "this may also explain the non - zero velocities measured for some galaxies along the minor axis ( e.g , ngc3377 and ngc4464 ) .",
    "ngc4478 is the most spectacular case , since it exhibits signs of disturbed , perhaps unrelaxed kinematics .",
    "this galaxy is not axisymmetric and any dynamical model would need to be triaxial .",
    "this is also likely to be the case for the other galaxies which show non - zero velocities along the minor axis .",
    "some of the kinematic signatures we detect in our sample of lles , such as kdcs and central dips in velocity dispersion , are indicative of a merger scenario .",
    "it is interesting to note that in their recent merger simulations , bendo and barnes ( 2000 , hereafter bb2000 ) have presented losvds for the merger remnants of two spiral galaxies , which resemble elliptical galaxies . in these simulations",
    "central dips in @xmath2 were found for remnants of an _ equal - mass _ merger of two spirals .",
    "predictions for the profiles of rotation , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are however different from those observed in our study . in most cases",
    "@xmath7 is predicted to have a similar sign to the rotation velocity close to the galaxy centre ; for our galaxy sample , @xmath7 has an _ opposite _ sign to rotation . in one case in the study of bb2000 , where @xmath7 and rotation do have opposite signs",
    ", the merger remnant has a counterrotating core : neither of the two galaxies in our sample with a counterrotating core ( i.e. ngc 3608 and ngc 4458 ) have a central decrease in @xmath2 .",
    "for ngc 4387 , rotation rises steadily outside the galaxy centre in agreement with the simulation results , although @xmath8 is consistent with zero in contrast to the predicted values of positive @xmath8 .",
    "rotation velocities for the unequal - mass mergers considered by bb2000 are of far greater amplitude than the velocities measured in this study .    our long - slit observations provide a valuable insight into the dynamics of lles and demonstrate clearly that there exists a wide range of complex , sometimes non - axisymmetric kinematics . with data available only for the major and minor axis of a galaxy",
    "it is difficult , if not impossible , to describe the full dynamical make - up of galaxies .",
    "the newly commisioned integral field units such as sauron ( bacon et al . 2001 ) , however , provide 2-dimensional rotational velocity and velocity dispersion maps of early - type galaxies and will advance this area of astronomy .",
