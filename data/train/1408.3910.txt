    "entropy production in heat engines has been a key concept in establishing the fundamental laws of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "recently , the laws have been reconsidered for small systems in the context of fluctuation relations @xcite , which gave rise to much of experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite research .",
    "it is worth noting that the fluctuation relations are traditionally formulated in terms of entropy production that is computed with the definition described in ref .",
    "while the definition is perfect for classical states , its validity needs to be revisited in quantum mechanics , where shanon entropy is nonlinear in density matrix and its change is not necessarily related to the expectation value of any operator , and therefore its measurability is questionable @xcite .",
    "a quantum heat engine is a system of several discrete quantum states and , similar to a common heat engine , is connected to several environments kept at different temperatures .",
    "the motivation for research in qhe comes from studying models of photocells and photosynthesis @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that quantum effects can dramatically change the thermodynamics of qhes @xcite and their fluctuations @xcite manifesting the role of quantum coherence .",
    "we need to stress that the mere presence of discrete quantum states in the engine is not enough to reveal the coherence .",
    "the effects come from non - diagonal elements of the engine density matrix that require a coherent drive and/or degeneracy of the engine states to facilitate the formation of quantum superpositions @xcite .",
    "a generalization of shanon entropy is the rnyi entropy @xcite defined here ( see appendix a ) as @xmath0 $ ] , with @xmath1 being the density matrix of a quantum system .",
    "shanon entropy @xmath2 is obtained from @xmath3 by taking a formal limit @xmath4 .",
    "much theoretical research addresses rnyi entropies in strongly interacting systems , in particular spin chains @xcite .",
    "since @xmath3 is not linear in density matrix , its observability is not evident : some tricks @xcite may help in certain situations .",
    "similar to the flows of physical conserved quantities , such as charge and energy , conserved measures , such as shannon and renyi entropies , flow between subsystems .",
    "recently , one of the authors has proposed a method for consistent quantum evaluation of rnyi entropy flows , r - flows @xcite , defined as @xmath5 .",
    "the shanon entropy flow @xmath6 is obtained by taking limit @xmath7 . in this paper",
    ", we adjust and apply this method for qhe .",
    "we evaluate r - flows from a generic heat engine to a _ probe _ environment that is weakly coupled with the engine , thus not disturbing its workings . we find that r - flows can be naturally separated into incoherent and coherent parts ; this also pertains to the flow of shanon entropy .",
    "the incoherent part is related to the heat flow @xmath8 to the environment . for shanon entropy flow",
    "we recover the textbook formula @xmath9 , @xmath10 being the temperature of the probing environment .",
    "the coherent part is specific for coherent drive and is proportional to the second power of the density matrix of the engine .",
    "this raises concerns about its observability .",
    "however , the coherent part can be accessed in an experiment that is different from heat flow measurement : there , one measures averaged forces acting on the environment and computes the would - be dissipation due to these forces . while this fictitious dissipation is _ not _ the heat flow , it does contribute to the entropy flows .",

    "all states within a set have approximately the same energy @xmath13 , the splitting @xmath14 within a set being much smaller than @xmath15 .",
    "the system is subject to the external field with the frequency @xmath16 ( we set @xmath17 where appropriate ) described by the hamiltonian @xmath18 , and the relevant matrix elements are between the states of two sets .    the quantum system is coupled to a number of environments labeled by @xmath19 kept at different temperatures @xmath20 .",
    "the interaction with the environment is described by @xmath21 , with @xmath22 being the operators in the space of environment @xmath19 .",
    "we assume linear response of each environment on the state of quantum system . in this case ,",
    "each environment is completely characterized by the set of frequency - dependent generalized susceptibilities @xmath23 that are related to the correlators of @xmath24 defined as @xmath25 .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem yields the relations in frequency domain : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , and the bose distribution @xmath28 .",
    "the environments produce transition rates between the states of quantum system and affect the coherence of its density matrix @xmath29 .",

    "@xmath35 if @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 otherwise .",
    "the residual hamliltonian is composed of three groups of terms @xmath39 the first term is the original small splitting of the states , the second and third terms represent the coherent drive and the last term is the renormalization due to the interaction with the environments .",
    "the dissipative terms @xmath40 are sums over the contributions of each environment , @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "the relevant terms satisfy @xmath43 . in the rotating wave approximation",
    "we can replace @xmath44 with @xmath45 . in the absence of the drive and for the non - degenerate states the only relevant @xmath40 s are the transition rates from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , the density matrix is diagonal and the equation reduces to the master equation .",
    "the bloch equation ( [ eq : bloch ] ) can be obtained by time - dependent perturbation theory for density matrix in time interval @xmath48 $ ] where evolution operators for bra and ket are expanded in terms of @xmath49 , this sets the time ordering along the keldysh contour that has opposite time directions for bra and ket ( left diagram in fig.[fig_worlds ] ) for relevant diagrams the @xmath50 are pairwise grouped , and the result of tracing over the environment is readily expressed in terms of @xmath51 .",
    "the density matrix @xmath52 is obtained by summation over all such diagrams .",
    "the compact way to achieve the summation is to take the diagrams ending at @xmath53 and thus contributing to @xmath54 at @xmath55 and replace @xmath56 with @xmath52 : this reproduces eq .",
    "( [ eq : bloch ] ) .",
    "to evaluate the rnyi entropy flow of @xmath57-th order to an environment @xmath58 we need to use the perturbation theory for the @xmath57-th power of its density matrix , @xmath59 . to this end",

    "the environment @xmath58 is thus _ probe _ one and hardly affect the density matrix of the system . in this case ,",
    "rnyi entropy flow to the environment @xmath58 is directly given by the second - order diagrams encompassing two operators @xmath64 .",
    "the diagrams are expressed in terms of the generalized correlators of two @xmath64 that contain multiple powers of @xmath61 , @xmath65 and , for general @xmath61 , do not correspond to any physical quantities .",
    "however , we derive that for the probe environment in the state of thermal equilibrium the correlators obey the generalized kubo - martin - schwinger ( kms ) relation ( see appendix c ) , @xmath66 and therefore are all expressed in terms of the dissipative susceptibilities . in derivation , we assume that @xmath67 does not depend on temperature . if this is not so , @xmath67 is taken at @xmath68 .",
    "collecting all diagrams ( see appendix b ) , we obtain for @xmath63 the following expression : @xmath69 the r - flow is naturally separated onto two parts , which we name _ incoherent _ and _ coherent_. the same - world diagrams contribute to the incoherent part that is proportional to @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath70 is linear in @xmath1 so that is an observable .",

    "we prove that for a general situation where elementary energy transfers are not restricted to @xmath78 , this part of the r - flows is related to full counting statistics of energy transfers and therefore can be measured @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the coherent part is more involved and interesting . to proceed ,",
    "let us replace in @xmath79 the operators @xmath80 with classical external forces @xmath81 that are numerically equal to the elements of the system density matrix .",
    "the time - dependence of these forces is given by @xmath82 .",
    "these classical forces would cause energy dissipation to the probe environment that is determined from the forces and the dissipative part of susceptibility @xmath67 .",
    "this _ fictitious energy dissipation _ is precisely @xmath83 .",
    "we stress that this is not the physical dissipation occurring in the probe environment given by @xmath84 .",
    "however , @xmath83 can be extracted from the measurement results : for this , one can characterize the susceptibilities involved , measure @xmath85 ( or corresponding @xmath86 ) and compute @xmath83 .",
    "therefore we show that both parts of r - flows can be extracted from the measurement results , although in a different way : r - flows are physical .",
    "in addition , we show that the entropy flow is not directly related to energy flow .",
    "rather , @xmath87 the difference is due to quantum coherent effects in our heat engine .",

    "before summarizing , let us shortly outline how to compute r - flows to an environment that essentially disturbs the dynamics of the system : for the example considered this implies @xmath121 . in this case , the summation of the second - order diagrams leads to a linear evolution equation that generalizes eq .",
