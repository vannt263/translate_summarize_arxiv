    "the great success of -dmr results ( smoot 1992 , bennet 1996a , grski 1996 ) had a considerable impact on the scientific community being the first detection of cmb ( cosmic microwave background ) anisotropy and supporting the gravitational instability scenario for structure formation .",
    "detailed predictions for the cmb angular power spectrum in different cosmological models and the proper signature of different cosmological parameters ( e.g. zaldarriaga & seljak 1997 ) are now quite well established . a significant number of new experiments , both ground - based and balloon - borne , with sensitivity and angular resolution better than  ( e.g. lasenby 1998 and de  bernardis & masi 1998 ) are going to be designed and constructed and will deliver good quality data sets in the next few years .",
    "it is also clear ( danese 1996 ) that only a space mission free from unwanted contamination from ground and earth atmosphere and with a nearly full - sky coverage can fully exploit the gold mine of cosmological information imprinted in the cmb anisotropy . the two space missions map ( microwave anisotropy probe )",
    "( see bennet 1996b ) by nasa and planck ( mandolesi 1998 , puget 1998 ) by esa are planned for the next decade , the first to be launched in the year 2001 and the second in 2007 .",
    "these planned observations , with their wealth of cosmological information , will play a determinant role to fully understand the properties and the evolution of the universe .",
    "in particular , planck is a third - generation cmb space missions designed to achieve unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution over the entire sky .",
    "the extremely wide frequency range ( @xmath4  ghz ) explored by the combination of two focal plane arrays , the low frequency instrument ( lfi ) and the high frequency instrument ( hfi ) , will allow to efficiently separate the frequency independent primary cosmological information from astrophysical signatures ( e.g. de  zotti 1999 ) by taking advantage from their proper frequency dependencies .    as for any cmb experiment , great attention has to be devoted by the two mission teams to all the possible systematic effects . in the context of the planck mission",
    "we have carried out a detailed study of one of these effects : the so - called @xmath0 , or low - frequency , noise which is particularly relevant for the lfi radiometers , leading to stripes in the final maps which increase the overall noise level and may alter the statistical analysis of the anisotropy distribution .",
    "recent analytical work by seiffert ( 1997 ) has shown the dependency of the @xmath0 noise upon the radiometer characteristics such as the bandwidth , the noise temperature , payload environment temperature and other quantities properly related to planck - lfi radiometers .",
    "they can be combined to define a representative parameter , the `` knee - frequency '' @xmath5 , which has to be kept as low as possible compared with the spinning frequency @xmath6 of the spacecraft .",
    "janssen ( 1996 ) have indeed demonstrated that for @xmath7 a degradation in final sensitivity will result .    in sect .",
    "[ sourcenoise ] we briefly summarize the source of the @xmath0 noise and the dependency of the knee - frequency upon the radiometer properties . in sect .",
    "[ destriping ] we outline the framework of our simulations , evaluate the possible impact of @xmath0 noise and present the technique for removing the @xmath0 noise in the context of planck - lfi .",
    "the main results both for un - reduced and reduced @xmath0 noise are presented in sect .",
    "[ results ] .",
    "our main conclusions and implications for the scanning strategy are discussed in sect .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "the presence of unwanted systematic effects is one of the main difficulties in cmb anisotropy experiments .",
    "the so - called @xmath0 noise , typically generated by hemt ( high electron mobility transistor ) amplifier gain instabilities , is of particular interest for the planck - lfi since , if not properly corrected , it may lead to stripes in the final maps due to the satellite scanning strategy .",
    "therefore it is of great importance to reduce the impact of such effect both by hardware and software techniques .",
    "the lfi receiver concept is driven by the need to reduce instability effects .",
    "bersanelli ( 1995 ) described the design of lfi radiometers ( fig .",
    "[ radiometer ] ) which are modified blum correlation receivers ( blum 1959 , colvin 1961 ) known also as pseudo - correlation or continuous comparison receivers .",
    "the details of the radiometer will not be described here .",
    "the main feature to note is that the receivers have two inputs : one from one of the two polarization directions of a feed - horn and one from a reference load .",
    "the signal is sent by an hybrid coupler in the two `` legs '' of the receiver where it is amplified and phase shifted .",
    "the signal after a second hybrid , is amplified again and detected .",
    "1truecm    the output signal is proportional to the signal difference at the two inputs .",
    "this is achieved by differencing successive measurements at the detector which , for the receiver design , come from the horn and from the load respectively . the ideal situation with respect to the sensitivity to systematic effects",
    "is when the output is nulled .",
    "it is therefore important that the temperatures of the reference load be as close as possible to the @xmath8  k temperature of the sky signal .",
    "furthermore , a nearly - null output is obtained by adjusting properly the dc gain ratio @xmath9 after the diodes at the value @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the temperature from the reference load input .",
    "seiffert ( 1997 ) have reported an accurate analysis of the source of @xmath0 noise in the final output of this receiver design .",
    "the ideal white noise sensitivity for this kind of radiometer is given by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the bandwidth ( for lfi 20% of the central frequency ) , @xmath14 is the integration time , @xmath15 is the signal at horn input and @xmath16 is the noise temperature of the amplifier .",
    "the main source of @xmath0 noise resulted be gain fluctuations in the hemt amplifiers which have a typical @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "these fluctuations translate into fluctuations of the noise temperature @xmath16 with the same spectral shape .",
    "noise temperature fluctuations @xmath17 can mimic a change in the radiometer output @xmath18= \\sqrt{2}\\left[\\frac{a\\times t_n}{\\sqrt{f}}\\right]\\left[\\frac{1-r}{2}\\right ] \\",
    ", , \\label{equiv}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the square root of the spectral amplitude of noise temperature fluctuations .",
    "following seiffert ( 1997 ) , we define the `` knee - frequency '' when @xmath20 .",
    "this leads to the expression @xmath21 typical values are @xmath22 for 30 and 44 ghz radiometers and @xmath23 for 70 and 100 ghz .",
    "[ example ] reports an example of simulated output for a pure white noise and a white noise plus @xmath0 noise signal : their difference is much more clear in fourier space where the @xmath0 noise spectrum shows up at low frequencies",
    ".    for the 30 ghz channel , with @xmath24 k , @xmath25 k , @xmath13=6 ghz , @xmath26 k eq.([knee ] ) gives a @xmath27 hz .",
    "for a 4 k reference load , which is now the adopted baseline , the knee - frequency reduces to @xmath28 mhz .",
    "for the 100 ghz channel @xmath5 is higher ( 0.11 hz ) for a 20 k reference load and is reduced to less than 1 mhz for the 4 k load .",
    "as reported in mandolesi ( 1998 ) , the selected orbit for planck satellite will be a lissajous orbit around the l2 lagrangian point of the sun - earth system .",
    "the spacecraft spins at 1 r.p.m . and the spin axis is kept on the ecliptic plane at constant solar angle by repointing of 2.5@xmath29 every hour .",
    "the field of view of the two instruments is between @xmath30 from the spin - axis direction .",
    "hence planck will trace large circles in the sky : these circles cross each other in regions close to the ecliptic poles .",
    "the shape and width of these regions depend upon the angle @xmath31 , the scanning strategy and beam location in the focal plane .",
    "the value of the angle @xmath31 has not yet been fully defined , as well as the scanning strategy , which may or may not include a periodic motion of the spin - axis away from the ecliptic plane .",
    "these options depend on a trade - off between different systematic effects ( striping , thermal effects , straylight ) , which has to be carefully addressed .    here",
    "we made an attempt in this direction taking into consideration the @xmath0 noise alone as if all the other systematics were negligible .",
    "this is of course an idealised situation but gives us an estimate of the impact of this effect that therefore should be regarded as a lower limit .",
    "nonetheless this result may help for a better design of the instrument .",
    "future work will consider a more complete situation when a detailed thermal transient analysis will be available for the planck spacecraft .",
    "burigana ( 1997 , 1998 ) has described in detail the code we have implemented for the planck scanning strategy and we refer the reader to these papers .",
    "the relevant geometrical inputs are the beam location in the focal plane and the angle @xmath31 between the spin and pointing axis .    for each beam position on the focal plane our code outputs the complete data stream .",
    "we consider here a reduced version of the actual baseline for the scanning strategy ( actual parameters in parentheses ) : spin - axis shift of 5@xmath29 every 2 hours ( instead of 2.5@xmath29 every hour ) and three samplings per fwhm of 30@xmath29 at 30 ghz ( instead of 12 samplings every 30@xmath29 , i.e. 4 samplings every 10@xmath29 , the fwhm at 100  ghz ; see mandolesi 1998 ) .",
    "these modifications allow us to explore a large region of the parameter space , beam position , @xmath5 , scanning strategy and pointing angle @xmath31 , in reasonable time .",
    "furthermore we do not consider the single minute data stream but we take the average over the 120 circles forming a given 2-hours set . in",
    "what follows we run simulations for the 30 ghz channel .",
    "wright ( 1996 ) has shown that possible data filtering on a given scan circle may help in reducing the impact of @xmath0 noise .",
    "this is useful for values of @xmath5 typical for `` total power '' receivers which are much higher that our 0.05 hz and we chose not to include this technique here .",
    "it is clear from eqs.([whitenoise ] ) and ( [ knee ] ) that both the sensitivity and the `` knee - frequency '' depend on the actual temperature in the sky @xmath15 seen by the horn .",
    "our synthetic model for microwave sky emission includes a standard cdm prediction for cmb fluctuations plus a model of galactic emission .",
    "this model has the spatial template from the dust emission ( schlegel 1998 ) but has been normalized to include contribution from synchrotron , free - free and dust according to -dmr results ( kogut 1996 ) .",
    "the major foreground contamination at 30 ghz comes from synchrotron and free - free .",
    "we then choose to overestimate the overall synchrotron fluctuations by a factor of @xmath32 10 .",
    "this is the worst case scenario with respect to destriping efficiency ( see sect .",
    "[ streamtomap ] and [ destri ] ) .",
    "of course the impact of the sky temperature is small , since @xmath15 is a small fraction of the noise temperature @xmath16 : this is in fact @xmath33 10 k while @xmath34  k at 30  ghz and the maximum galactic contamination adopted here is about 44 mk . in this evaluation of @xmath15",
    "we include also a typical environment temperature of about 1 k.    we do not perform a convolution with a real beam pattern and sky signal since the real beam pattern will be in general not perfectly symmetric , not perfectly gaussian and with sidelobe contributions which will introduce other kinds of contamination . since we want to estimate here only the impact of @xmath0 noise we convolve our input map with a gaussian beam with the nominal fwhm ( 33@xmath29 ) of the 30  ghz planck - lfi channel we consider .",
    "we have the possibility to generate different kinds of noise spectra .",
    "we work in fourier space and generate the real and imaginary part of fourier coefficients of our noise signal .",
    "the noise spectrum has the usual form : @xmath35 \\ , , \\label{spectrum}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is a normalization factor and @xmath37 takes typical values from 1 to 2.5 depending on the source of noise ( gain drift of thermal effects ) : @xmath38 is the @xmath0 noise case . in general",
    "it is a good approximation to take @xmath39 vanishing for @xmath40 and @xmath41 . delabrouille ( 1998 ) proposed @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    after generating a realisation of the real and imaginary part of the fourier coefficients with spectrum defined in eq.([spectrum ] ) , we fft ( fast fourier transform ; cooley & tukey 1965 ; heideman 1984 ) them and obtain a real noise stream which has to be normalized to the white noise level defined in eq.([whitenoise ] ) . we use a typical value of @xmath44 hz for the knee - frequency at 30 ghz assuming a 20 k load temperature ( see sect .",
    "[ sourcenoise ] ) . we chose to generate noise streams of about @xmath45 data points , corresponding to 8 spin axis positions or 16 hours",
    ": this seems a reasonable compromise among our present knowledge of real hardware behaviour and the required computational time with respect noise stream length .",
    "the actual time for a generation of a noise stream 16 hours long and one year of mission even in our reduced scanning strategy will require about 10 hours on a silicon graphics machine with 2 gb of ram and clock speed of 225 mhz",
    ". we also verified that the most time consuming operation in our code is just the fft @xmath0 noise generation .    the possibility to generate",
    "the noise streams with a completely arbitrary spectrum in real space ( e.g. beccaria 1996 and cuoco & curci 1997 and references therein ) , without the use of fft , seems very promising for considerably reducing the computational time ( wandelt 1999 , wandelt & grski 1999 ) .",
    "the final output of our `` flight - simulator '' are 4 matrices with a number of rows equal to the considered spin - axis positions @xmath46 ( for one year of mission @xmath47 in our reduced baseline as in sect.[flight ] ) and a number of columns equal to the number of integrations , weakly dependent on @xmath31 , along one scan circle ( here @xmath48 ) .",
    "the input and output maps are in healpix pixelisation scheme ( grski 1998 , http://www.tac.dk/~healpix ) ; we use an input map with a resolution of about 3.5@xmath29 corresponding to 12 million equal area pixels on the full sky .    for each circle ,",
    "the code outputs are the pixel number @xmath49 at the specified resolutions , the temperature plus total noise contribution @xmath50 ( white plus @xmath0 noise ) , the temperature with only white noise @xmath51 and the pure signal as observed in absence of instrumental noise @xmath52 .",
    "the * w * and * g * will be used for studying the degradation of @xmath0 noise with respect to the ideal pure white noise case and the impact of scanning strategy geometry on observed pixel temperatures .",
    "we can arbitrarily choose the temperature output data stream resolution from 3.5@xmath29 to higher values ( smaller resolution ) which set also the output temperature map resolution .",
    "regarding the data stream for the pixel number outputs we can also use higher resolutions , allowing to test the impact of using more or less stringent crossing conditions in the destriping algorithm ( see the following section ) .    from these data streams",
    "it is quite simple to obtain observed simulated maps : we make use of @xmath49 and @xmath50 to coadd the temperatures of those pixels observed several times during the mission . in the same way we build maps with only white noise contribution , without receiver noise , as well as a sensitivity map knowing how many times a single pixel is observed .    in fig .",
    "[ maponeonf ] we show a pure noise ( white plus @xmath0 ) map in ecliptic coordinates after signal subtraction ( @xmath53 ) : stripes are clearly present .",
    "we developed a simple technique which is able to eliminate gain drifts due to @xmath0 noise .",
    "this is derived from the cobras / samba phase a study proposal ( bersanelli 1996 ) and from a re - analysis of delabrouille ( 1998 ) . as reported by delabrouille ( 1998 ) the effect of @xmath0 noise",
    "can be seen as one or more additive levels , different for each scan circle .",
    "we worked with averaged ( over 2 hours period ) scan circles and hence we nearly removed drifts within each circle : what is left is related to the `` mean '' @xmath0 noise level for this observation period . in fact averaging scan circles into a single ring corresponds to a low - pass filtering operation .",
    "as long as @xmath5 is not far larger than the spin frequency , this ensures that only the very lowest frequency components of the @xmath0 noise survive .",
    "therefore it is a good approximation to model the averaged @xmath0 noise as a constant offset @xmath54 for each ring for the set of parameters we are using .",
    "we want to obtain the baselines for all the circles and re - adjust the signals correspondingly .",
    "delabrouille ( 1998 ) claimed the possibility that working with multiple baseline per circle ( @xmath55 = number of baseline levels ) may result in a better destriping . in our code",
    "this is equivalent to dividing the rows of each output matrices in @xmath55 parts : the result will be matrices with @xmath56 rows and @xmath57 columns .    in order to estimate the different @xmath54 we have to find common pixels observed by different scan circles and the pixel size in the matrix *",
    "n * is a key parameter .",
    "increasing the resolution used in * n * reduces the number of crossings possibly yielding to lower destriping efficiency , while adopting resolutions lower than the resolution of the input map and of the matrix * t * introduces extra noise , related to variations of real sky temperature within the scale corresponding to the lower resolution adopted in * n * , which is not taken into account in the estimate of receiver noise and may introduce artifacts in the destriping code .",
    "the adopted pessimistic galactic emission model , which by construction has gradients larger than those inferred by current data , emphasizes this effect and our simulations are then conservative in this respect . in the following @xmath58 ,",
    "@xmath59 and @xmath60 will denote the pixel number , the temperature and the white noise level for the pixel in the @xmath61 row and @xmath62 column .",
    "let us denote a generic pair of different observations of the same pixel with an index @xmath63 which will range between 1 and @xmath64 , the total number of pairs found . in this notation @xmath63",
    "is related to two elements of @xmath49 : @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 identify different scan circles and @xmath68 and @xmath69 the respective position in each of the two circles .",
    "we want to minimize the quantity : @xmath70 ^ 2 } { e_{il}^2+e_{jm}^2}\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\     & = & \\sum_{\\pi=1}^{n_c } \\left[\\frac{[(a_i - a_j ) - ( t_{il}-t_{jm})]^2 } { e_{il}^2+e_{jm}^2}\\right]_\\pi   \\label{firstmini}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with respect to the unknown levels @xmath54 .",
    "the sub - index @xmath63 indicates that each set of @xmath71 is used in that summation .",
    "it is clear that @xmath72 is quadratic in all the unknown @xmath54 and that only differences between @xmath54 enter into eq.([firstmini ] ) .",
    "therefore the solution is determined up to an arbitrary additive constant ( with no physical meaning for anisotropy measurements ) .",
    "we choose then to remove this indetermination by requiring that @xmath73 .",
    "this is equivalent to replace eq.([firstmini ] ) with @xmath74 .",
    "after some algebra we finally get : @xmath75\\cdot [ \\delta_{ik}-\\delta_{jk } ] }              { e_{il}^2-e_{jm}^2}\\right]_\\pi \\nonumber \\\\               & + & \\sum_{h=1}^{n_s } a_h = 0 \\label{secondmini}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for all the @xmath76 ( here @xmath77 is the usual kronecker symbol ) .",
    "this translates into a set of @xmath46 linear equation @xmath78 which can be easily solved .",
    "furthermore we note that by construction the matrix @xmath79 of @xmath80 coefficients is symmetric , positive defined and non singular .",
    "the first property permits to hold in memory only one half of the matrix @xmath79 ( e.g. the upper - right part ) , the second allows us to solve the linear system without having to exchange rows or columns ( strang 1976 ) , so preserving the symmetry .",
    "the non - singularity of @xmath79 is true provided that there are enough intersections between different circles and hence is related to the resolution at which we look for common pixels between different scan circles , to the scanning strategy and beam location .",
    "a detailed discussion of numerical algorithm for solving this system with significant saving of required ram is presented in burigana ( 1997 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the applicability of this destriping technique does not depend upon any a - priori assumption about the real value of @xmath5 or the real noise spectral shape since it can work also for different values of the exponent @xmath37 in eq.([spectrum ] ) , althought its efficiency could be in principle partially optimized in relation to the properties of the noise and of the sky gradients .",
    "we first consider an angle @xmath81 between telescope and spin axes and a beam location with ( @xmath82 ) . here",
    "@xmath83 is the angle from the optical axis : this is a typical value for the 100 ghz ( with a @xmath84  m aperture off - axis gregorian telescope ) horns while the 30 ghz beams are placed at larger @xmath83 values .",
    "this assumption is therefore conservative with respect to the destriping efficiency , since in this case the region of crossings between scan circles is smaller and closer to ecliptic poles .",
    "the angle @xmath85 is the beam center displacement from the axis given by the intersection between the sky field of view plane and the plane containing the telescope and spin axes ( see burigana 1998 ) .",
    "our choice of @xmath86 is intermediate between 0@xmath1 ( or 180@xmath1 ) and 90@xmath1 which are equivalent for the destriping respectively to an on - axis beam ( with crossings only at ecliptic poles for @xmath81 ) and a beam which spreads crossings over the wider possible region .",
    "the adopted beam location is therefore a non - degenerate case although non optimal .",
    "the knee frequency @xmath87 hz and the microwave sky emission is modeled as in sect.[flight ] .",
    "-0.5truecm    we evaluated the impact of @xmath0 noise both in terms of added @xmath88 noise and of angular power spectrum .",
    "the output of our simulations is expressed in antenna temperature and has to be converted into thermodynamic temperature for the comparison with cmb power spectrum , as usually predicted in theoretical models . at 30 ghz",
    "the conversion factor is very close to unity ( @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the @xmath88 in antenna temperature ) .",
    "the white noise power spectrum can be derived analytically knowing the total number of pixels in the sky and pixel sensitivity : @xmath91      we now give a short theoretical argument for the expected morphology of the @xmath92 power spectra of the simulated striping pattern . for scanning without wobbling or precession",
    ", two angular scales fully determine the structure of the striping pattern on the sky .",
    "one is the half opening angle @xmath93 of the ecliptic equator which the spin axis traces on the sky as planck completes a full orbit about the sun .",
    "this makes the noise pattern symmetric under parity , on average .",
    "it follows that the correlation function for the noise pattern is symmetric about @xmath94 , with a strong peak at @xmath95 and for the @xmath0 component @xmath96 for all odd @xmath97 .",
    "the other scale is the half opening angle of the scanning rings @xmath98 .",
    "this leads to peaks in the correlation function at @xmath99 and by symmetry at @xmath100 .",
    "the combination of these two nearby scales leads to beats in the @xmath92 , which are visually apparent as the `` blob '' in figs .",
    "4,8,10,12 and 14 .",
    "treating this effect in the same way as the appearance of fringes in an interference pattern we can calculate the width in @xmath97 of each blob as @xmath101 .",
    "this is in quantitative agreement with our numerically computed spectra .",
    "it also explains the absence of beats in figure 10 , where @xmath102 and the power spectrum can be understood as a single blob with infinite @xmath103 .    for scanning strategies with some kind of `` wobble '' ,",
    "ie .  where the spin axis does not trace out the ecliptic equator on the sky , the correlation function will still be approximately symmetric if the amplitude of the wobble is small compared to @xmath94 and the above statements remain approximately true .",
    "however , the fact that the symmetry is weakly broken can be seen in figure 8 , where the interference effect is slightly washed out and the beats do not reach all the way down to the white noise level .",
    "the offset of the blobs compared to the white noise level is given by the @xmath88 excess power due to the @xmath0 noise component . at first sight",
    "it may be surprising that other than this normalisation , the shape of the excess power power spectrum @xmath92 of the striping pattern is independent of the spectral content of the noise , as parametrised by the knee frequency .",
    "this is due to the filtering effect of co - adding scan circles into rings discussed above . in the regime",
    "which our simulations probe , the structure which remains on each ring is well described by a constant offset plus white noise . hence , as long as sufficiently many scan circles are co - added , changing the knee frequency simply scales the relative contribution of @xmath0 and white noise to the noise pattern @xmath92 .      in fig .",
    "[ eclbef ] we show the square root of the power spectrum ( which is roughly proportional to @xmath88 contribution of temperature per @xmath97-bin ) before applying the destriping technique : the solid line is the white noise level as derived from eq.([clwhitenoise ] ) and the superimposed spectrum is derived from a simulation with only white noise included .",
    "the agreement is very good which confirms the accuracy of our simulator and map - making algorithm .",
    "the gray line is the global noise spectrum ( white and @xmath0 noise together ) .",
    "the spectrum is clearly non - white : blobs are present .",
    "the excess of noise in terms of both @xmath104 and @xmath105 is about 40% of white noise level .",
    "[ nostripes ] shows the noise map after applying our destriping code : stripes are no more evident and fig .",
    "[ baselines ] shows the recovered baselines by destriping algorithm .",
    "this situation can be quantified by computing the noise power spectrum of the destripped map , as shown in fig .",
    "[ eclaft ] .",
    "now the spectrum is considerably flatter and no more blobs are present , with an overall noise excess of 1 - 2% over the white noise level .",
    "this confirms the efficiency of the destriping algorithm , under the above mentioned simplifying assumptions . on the other hand",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ eclaft ] that at large scales , corresponding to @xmath106 , a non - negligible residual contribution is present in the noise spectrum .",
    "a lower knee frequency ( achievable with the reference loads at 4k ) is necessary to further reduce the effect .",
    "we also investigated if different scanning strategies may help in destriping efficiency .",
    "possible periodic motion of the spin - axis away from the ecliptic plane have the effect of broadening the region of crossings between different circles .",
    "this goes in the direction of removing possible degeneracies in the destriping system .",
    "we implemented both sinusoidal oscillations and precessions : the first does not preserve the spacecraft solar illumination and this is likely to induce thermal effects and drifts in the data .    -0.5truecm    -0.5truecm    -0.5truecm    the second is then preferable , since it keeps the solar angle constant as the satellite moves the spin - axis . for both the motions we performed 10 complete oscillations per year of mission with 10   amplitude .",

    "this situation is representative of horns which , in the focal plane arrangement , are placed close to the scanning direction : from the destriping point of view these horns are indeed equivalent to on - axis horns and intersections between different scan circles are nearly only at ecliptic poles .",
    "this represents a degenerate situation with respect to destriping efficiency . fig .",
    "[ onbef ] and fig .",
    "[ onaft ] show noise power spectra for this on - axis case before and after destriping respectively : the geometry of the simulation is changed and the same for blob shape which is not well defined . here",

    "after destriping we are left with an excess of noise of the order of 5% of the white noise and the noise spectrum is considerable less flat than before . such excess noise and a non - flat spectrum around @xmath110 ( where the first cmb doppler peak is expected ) after destriping is clearly not acceptable for the feeds aligned with the scan direction .",
    "moving the spin axis is a way to remove this degeneracy , as well as to complete the sky coverage for all channels .    -0.5truecm",
    "-0.5truecm    keeping fixed the beam position we move the angle @xmath31 from 90  to 85 : this of course leaves small regions around ecliptic poles which are not observed but has the advantage to enlarge the scan circle crossing region . fig .",

    "[ 85aft ] show noise power spectra before and after destriping respectively for this 85 , on - axis case : now blobs are clearly visible with dimensions in @xmath97-space different from fig .",
    "[ eclbef ] due to different geometrical configuration .",
    "these blobs are completely removed after destriping leaving a level of added noise after destriping of only @xmath111 2% over the white noise .",
    "this is essentially what we obtained for the off - axis configuration .",
    "-0.5truecm    all the simulations considered so far were performed with a @xmath44 hz which is derived from eq.([knee ] ) assuming a @xmath112 k of reference load . to decrease the residual effect , a 4 k reference load",
    "is being designed , exploiting the 4  k stage of the hfi . in this configuration",
    "it is expected that the resulting knee frequency would be less than 10 mhz .",
    "we have run a simulation with @xmath113  hz with the usual off - axis configuration with @xmath108 . as for the other cases we report noise power spectra before and after destriping in fig .",
    "[ 001bef ] and fig .",
    "[ 001aft ] .",
    "-0.5truecm    it is interesting to note that now the level of added noise is 9% before destriping and reduces only to 0.5% after applying destriping algorithm .",
    "although a comparison among different kinds of systematic effects ( burigana 1999 ) and studying how they combine in lfi observations is out of the aim of the present work , we have tried a first attempt in considering the sensitivity of this destriping algorithm to one of the most relevant source of contamination in planck measurements , the beam shape asymmetry .",
    "we have considered two simulations : one with a pure circular gaussian beam and another with a highly elliptical gaussian beam with a ratio of 1.7 between major and minor axis , that exibit rms differences of about 5  @xmath114k in the temperatures observed in the same sky directions ( burigana 1998 ) .",
    "the impact of beam ellipticity on destriping efficiency appears to be small : it has a maximum effect which is @xmath333 times smaller than the white noise level between @xmath115 ( burigana 1999 ) .",
    "this preliminary result suggests that the adopted algorithm may be only weakly dependent on the contamination introduced by other kinds of systematic effects ; further investigations are demanded to confirm this perspective .",
    "we have reported here an extensive study of the @xmath0 noise contamination for different scanning strategies , beam location on the focal plane as well as for different values of the knee frequency . even in this idealised situation ( all other systematics are well under control ) we can gain useful information from our study .",
    "first of all from these simulations it seems that moving the spin - axis away from the ecliptic plane does not significantly help the destriping efficiency for typical lfi beam locations and , concerning the @xmath0 noise alone as source of drifts , it would be preferable to keep the spin - axis always on the ecliptic plane .",
    "this is clear when we compare results as those in fig  [ eclaft ] and fig .",
    "[ preaft ] which are practically identical .    furthermore for most of the lfi beams the choice of @xmath108 would be acceptable : the destriping left only @xmath116 of excess noise with respect to the pure white noise case . on the other hand ,",
    "some lfi beams are equivalent to on - axis beam which , from fig .",
    "[ onaft ] , is clearly a degenerate case .",
    "a smaller value of @xmath31 ( namely 85 ) breaks this degeneracy at an acceptable level yielding the usual destriping efficiency . from these two points",
    "an indication of a possible choice of the scanning strategy and instrument configuration arises : with @xmath117 and precession of the spin - axis ( no thermal drifts ) with only 5amplitude ( half of what we considered here ) appears satisfactory for de - striping performances while preserving full - sky coverage for all channels .",
    "this allows data redundancy but introduces irregularities in the integration time distribution , which may be an issue for the data analysis . without spin axis modulations ,",
    "a quite complete sky coverage and a smooth integration time distribution at each frequency can be achieved only by assembling data from different receivers , losing redundancy .",
    "we have considered also the destriping efficiency when using more than a single baseline level @xmath54 per scan circle : results reported in burigana ( 1997 ) indicate that for the @xmath0 noise case no significant improvements are achieved : either the @xmath0 noise level per circle is almost constant and equivalent to a single baseline , or the accuracy in the determination of more levels per circle decreases .",
    "the whole set of simulations seems to indicate that there is enough redundancy of observations to remove at acceptable level the contamination due to @xmath0 noise even if we require a more strict condition of crossings between scan circles .",
    "of course , the performance of this destriping code could be partially optimized in the future by appropriately choosing the number of levels per circle and the crossing condition according to the dominant kind of instrumental noise ( the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath37 ) , the magnitude of the gradients in the sky emission and our knowledge of other contamination sources .    for what concerns",
    "properly the @xmath0 noise , an important indication comes from the simulation with @xmath118  hz : the excess of noise before destriping reduces by a factor @xmath119 with respect to the case @xmath87  hz .",
    "reaching @xmath118  hz is a goal of the lfi design , which will ensure a clean and robust observation .",
    "in addition the extra noise level after destriping decreases , at least under these ideal assumptions , by a factor @xmath120 .",
    "there are many open issues both astrophysical and instrumental .",
    "regarding the first , the microwave emission model we use , although pessimistic for what concerns galactic emission , can be completed with the inclusion of different foreground contributions .",
    "the emission from extragalactic point sources and in particular their variability may decrease our destriping efficiency .",
    "we have also not considered here any other source of possible systematic effects such as thermal effects and stray - light contamination induced by galaxy emission .",
    "burigana ( 1999 ) describe in detail the impact of stray - light contamination .",
    "also these effects may in principle degrade the accuracy in removing @xmath0 noise stripes .",
    "as proved by the scientific experience in many years of work both in physics and in cosmology and astrophysics , efficient data analysis tools can significantly improve the quality of the information extracted from the data , provided that the systematic effects are well understood , but the first and most important step in projecting experiments is to reduce all the contaminations at the lowest possible levels .",
    "it is then of great importance to decrease as much as possible the impact of @xmath0 noise before destriping and @xmath113 hz is an important goal for instrument studies and prototypes ."
