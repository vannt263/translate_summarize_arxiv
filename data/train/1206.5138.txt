    "however , with the advent of the lattice calculations published in @xcite and the smaller critical region @xmath14 mev obtained in that study ( which has been independently confirmed in @xcite ) , a revision of the effects of heavy resonances on the hadron resonance gas model became necessary .",

    "in this paper we present a more detailed comparison between the hadron resonance gas model calculations and the lattice data that not only provides strong evidence for the need of an exponentially increasing density of hadronic states with mass @xmath16 gev but also indicates that the density of states goes as @xmath18 at large @xmath2 with @xmath19 ( where @xmath4 mev ) . as in @xcite , we estimate that the maximum temperature at which the hadron resonance gas model is applicable is @xmath20 mev . a rough estimate of the shear viscosity computed within the excluded volume approximation for the hadron resonance model suggests that the shear viscosity to entropy ratio of hot hadronic matter is sensitive to the parameters that describe the hadron mass spectrum .",

    "one may wonder if the approximations made in ( [ pressure1]-[traceanomaly1 ] ) ( i.e. , classical statistics and continuous mass spectrum ) are at all justified .",
    "after all , we know that the measured hadronic spectrum is of course discrete and that baryons and mesons obey different statistics . however , as pointed out in @xcite , the simplified formulas in eqs .",
    "( [ pressure1]-[traceanomaly1 ] ) provide an excellent description of the thermodynamic properties of the hadron resonance gas computed using the measured hadrons in the particle data book with the correct statistics in the temperature range @xmath50 mev if one imposes an upper cutoff for the mass integrals .",

    "therefore , in order to have a hadronic equation of state that is both valid at low temperatures ( @xmath55 mev ) and higher temperatures a hybrid model containing the measured hadron states plus a continuous hagedorn spectrum above a certain mass cutoff is more appropriate @xcite .    a comparison between @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 of the model defined by eqs .",

    "the power law increase given by @xmath44 considerably simplifies the integrals in ( [ pressure1]-[traceanomaly1 ] ) and all of them can be done analytically .",

    "[ thermoplotrho4 ] that the power law spectrum lacks the exponential growth necessary to describe the lattice data for temperatures above 140 mev .",

    "are included , it is not at all guaranteed that the standard assumption behind hadron resonance models , i.e. , that the interacting hadronic system can be described by a free gas of the original hadrons and their resonances , is applicable . in general , the inclusion of resonances represents the contribution from the attractive channels while repulsive interactions can be modeled using simple excluded volume corrections to the thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the suggestion , obtained from a comparison to lattice data , that the complicated interactions among hadrons that enter in the calculations of qcd thermodynamics at temperatures of the order of the pion mass can be effectively modeled by a simple , non - interacting gas of hadrons and resonances in accordance with the bootstrap model @xcite is therefore quite unexpected and remarkable .",
    "given the known uncertainties in lattice calculations at low temperatures , the conclusion made above regarding the applicability of the hadron resonance gas should be taken with great care . if results obtained with finer lattices confirm this picture , this would provide very strong evidence for the validity of hagedorn s bootstrap hypothesis .",
    "we note in passing that recent lattice calculations of the thermodynamical properties of @xmath64 pure glue have shown evidence for the presence of an exponentially rising glueball mass spectrum below the deconfinement critical temperature @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , in general one should expect that there are repulsive interactions among hadrons and that a simple way to take that into account in the hadron resonance model is via the excluded volume corrections @xcite . in this case , the partition function in ( [ partitionfunction ] ) becomes @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the excluded volume by the @xmath67th hadron .",
    "we shall assume for simplicity that the volume excluded by each hadron is a constant that is basically the same for all hadrons , i.e. , @xmath68 .",

    ", one should expect that the volume corrections should be minimal in this case .",
    "in fact , one can again use the lattice data and the different hadron mass spectra discussed before to show that the excluded radius can not be larger than @xmath79 fm for @xmath80 ( @xmath48 ) .",

    "this analysis shows that volume corrections do not play a significant role in the description of lattice data ( at least for the mass spectra parameters determined in the previous section ) .",
    "of course , given the known uncertainties in lattice calculations at low temperatures , another possibility would be to define the parameters in a way that the model including the continuous spectrum fits the lattice data only at higher temperatures around @xmath85 mev , as it was done in @xcite .",
    "this will be discussed further in the next section .",
    "the computation of the transport properties of a hadronic mixture is not an easy task .",

    "@xcite where the shear viscosity of a multi - component gas of hadrons and resonances in the excluded volume approximation ( described in the previous section ) is given by @xmath87 currently , it is not known how to compute the contribution to the shear viscosity from heavily massive and highly unstable resonances that can not rigorously be described using the boltzmann equation .",
    "these states contribute significantly to the thermodynamic properties of the matter at high tempetatures ( as shown in the previous sections ) and , due to their rapid decay , it is natural to assume that their presence will affect the mean free paths of the other hadrons . in @xcite",

    "however , when computing @xmath8 , the entropy density should be the one determined within the same approximation , i.e , @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , even in this approximation @xmath8 possesses a nontrivial dependence on the hadron cross section @xmath91 .",

    "note that for the highest temperature considered @xmath92 mev , @xmath8 depends very weakly on @xmath70 when the excluded radius is larger than 0.2 fm ( using this specific set of parameters that define the mass spectrum ) .    in fig .",
    "[ plotetasrho3 ] we show the temperature dependence of @xmath8 computed using the density of states @xmath43 in eq .",

    "this value of the excluded radius is smaller than other estimates @xcite , which however were not constrained by fitting the lattice data .",

    "this highlights the importance of knowning the correct temperature dependence of the thermodynamic quantities of qcd at temperatures @xmath110 mev since it may play a important role in the calculation of transport coefficients .",
