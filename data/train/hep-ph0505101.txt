    "the description of the rise of hadronic cross sections with the center of mass energy @xmath0 within quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has been a challenging issue . old experimental results , e.g.  on proton scattering , do not yet have a satisfactory theoretical explanation .",
    "so far , no realization has been found for the froissart bound , which is a consequence of the unitarity of the @xmath1-matrix and which is a bound on the high energy behavior of the total cross sections , @xmath2 .",
    "a perturbative calculation of the evolution of scattering amplitudes with energy , achieved by balitsky , fadin , kuraev and lipatov ( bfkl ) 30 years ago @xcite and subsequently improved to next - to - leading order @xcite , is apparently successful in describing the rise of photon - proton cross sections when the virtuality of the photon is high enough .",
    "however , the bfkl equation , being linear , is not compatible with the froissart bound when it is extrapolated to very high energies .",
    "complying with the limits set by unitarity requires the introduction of nonlinear terms in the evolution equations . a first step in this direction",
    "was taken by gribov , levin and ryskin ( glr ) in 1981 @xcite , and by mueller and qiu ( mq ) in 1986 @xcite .",
    "subsequently , more involved qcd evolution equations were derived within different formalisms .",
    "balitsky , jalilian - marian , iancu , mclerran , weigert , leonidov and kovner ( b - jimwlk ) @xcite have developed a comprehensive approach to high energy scattering from different but converging points of view .",
    "technically , they were able to write the high energy evolution of qcd amplitudes in the form of a functional integro - differential equation , that can also be expressed as a langevin equation or as an infinite hierarchy of coupled differential equations .",
    "a much simpler equation was obtained by balitsky @xcite and by kovchegov @xcite ( bk ) in the particular physical context where the target is a large nucleus .",
    "the latter turns out to be a specific limit of the former , and its structure is similar to the glr - mq equation .    meanwhile , on the phenomenological side , golec - biernat and wsthoff showed @xcite that unitarization effects , that can not be taken into account by a linear evolution such as the bfkl equation , may have already be seen at the desy electron - proton collider hera .",
    "their observation gave a new impetus to the field and triggered many phenomenological and theoretical studies .",
    "furthermore , the model they had proposed pointed towards a new scaling , `` geometric scaling '' , which was subsequently found in the hera data @xcite .",
    "much insight and intuition has been gained from numerical studies : even before the b - jimwlk formalism had been developed , salam performed numerical calculations of scattering amplitudes near the unitarity limits in the framework of a monte - carlo implementation @xcite of mueller s color dipole model @xcite .",
    "more recently , much effort has been devoted to obtaining numerical solutions of the bk and b - jimwlk equations @xcite , and in particular to the understanding of geometric scaling .",
    "but no analytical solution could be found .",
    "important progress was accomplished when the first terms of the large rapidity asymptotic expansion of the solutions to the balitsky - kovchegov equation were computed by mueller and triantafyllopoulos @xcite .",
    "this expansion was subsequently systematized with the discovery @xcite that the bk equation lies in the universality class of the fisher - kolmogorov - petrovsky - piscounov ( fkpp ) equation @xcite , and that geometric scaling was equivalent to the property that the latter admits traveling wave solutions .",
    "the fkpp equation describes a vast class of physical phenomena , actively studied by mathematicians and statistical physicists .",
    "meanwhile , mueller and shoshi @xcite made a first step in going beyond the bk approximation to high energy scattering in qcd . through a sophisticated analysis of the unitarity and symmetry constraints on the qcd evolution",
    ", they were able to propose a correction to the saturation scale , induced by effects neglected in the bk evolution , and realized that geometric scaling was asymptotically broken .",
    "the complete equivalence between high energy qcd and statistical physics models of reaction - diffusion type , first understood by one of us ( s.m . ) @xcite , provided a new picture in which the nature of the effects neglected by the bk equation became transparent .",
    "the universality class of high energy qcd was identified as that of the stochastic fisher - kolmogorov - petrovsky - piscounov ( sfkpp ) equation @xcite .",
    "the latter applies to a very wide class of physical phenomena , ranging from directed percolation to population growth .",
    "it has many applications , e.g. to biology , genetics , anthropology , fluid mechanics .",
    "roughly speaking , most of the physical situations in which objects evolve by multiplying and diffusing , up to a certain limiting threshold , may be captured by an equation in the universality class of the sfkpp equation .",
    "the crucial point is that the qcd parton model has such dynamics , when viewed in a particular way that we will explain in this paper .",
    "once this observation is made , all mathematical results can be transposed to the physical context of high energy qcd @xcite .",
    "in particular , mueller and shoshi s results on the saturation scale are recovered .",
    "the breaking of geometric scaling , that they had understood qualitatively in their approach , is shown to be related to the statistical dispersion in the occupation numbers of partons in the hadronic fock state .",
    "this new point of view on high energy qcd not only confirmed and brought new exact results on qcd scattering amplitudes : it also provided a physical understanding of the very nature and the role of fluctuations contained in the qcd evolution equations .",
    "moreover , it helped to understand how to set up a systematics to go beyond the bk equation .",
    "it was recognized that the b - jimwlk formalism was not complete  @xcite , thus confirming what was expected @xcite .",
    "the form of the new terms can be written down taking advantage of the correspondence to statistical physics .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide numerical solutions of the evolution equations of qcd , in order to study accurately their universal properties .",
    "the outline goes as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec_setup ] , we explain how the parton model is related to a reaction - diffusion process . > from physical but rigorous arguments , we derive in a simple way the evolution of the parton densities with energy , reviewing and expanding upon refs .  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we show how the sfkpp equation appears . in sec .",
    "[ sec_meanfield ] , we study numerically in detail a useful mean field approximation to the full evolution equations  that is , the bk equation  in relation to the most recent analytical results . in the final sec .",
    "[ sec_stochastic ] , we go beyond , investigating in a toy model the full content of the sfkpp equation and its consequences in qcd .",
    "in this first section , we recall the physical picture of high energy scattering in the parton model ( sec .",

    "[ subsec_dm ] ) , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we derive the general evolution equations in qcd .",
    "let us consider the scattering of a hadronic probe off a given target , in the rest frame of the probe and at a fixed impact parameter . in the parton model",
    ", the target interacts through one of its quantum fluctuations ( see fig .  [ fluctuations ] ) .",
    "the probe effectively `` counts '' the partons in the current fock state of the target whose transverse momenta @xmath3 match the one of the probe : the amplitude @xmath4 for the scattering off this particular partonic configuration is proportional to the number of partons @xmath5 .    in qcd , the wave function of a hadronic object is built up from successive splittings of partons starting from the valence structure . as one increases the rapidity @xmath6 by boosting the target ,",
    "the opening of the phase space for parton splittings makes the probability for high occupation numbers larger . in the initial stages of the evolution",
    ", the parton density grows diffusively from these splittings .    on the other hand , the number of partons in each cell of transverse phase space is effectively limited to a maximum number @xmath7 that depends on the strength of the interaction of the probe with the partons , that is on the relationship between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this property is necessary from unitarity , which imposes an upper bound on the amplitude ( e.g. @xmath10 with standard normalizations ) which , in turn , results in an upper bound on @xmath5 .",
    "this is parton saturation and is realized by a recombination process .",
    "viewed in this way , scattering in the parton model is a reaction - diffusion process .",
    "the rapidity evolution of the fock states of the target hadron is like the time evolution of a set of particles that diffuse in space , multiply and recombine so that there is no more than @xmath7 particles on each site , on the average .",
    "we parametrize space by the variable @xmath11 : it will be related to @xmath3 in qcd .",
    "the qcd amplitude @xmath8 is like the fractional occupation number @xmath12 in the reaction - diffusion model .    in the continuum limit",
    ", it is known on general grounds @xcite that , up to a change of variable , @xmath13 obeys the evolution equation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a gaussian white noise , that is , a random function satisfying @xmath16 eq .  ( [ rft ] ) is known as the `` reggeon field theory '' equation .",
    "it is to be interpreted in the standard it way , as the continuum limit of a discretized equation .",
    "it belongs to the same universality class as the stochastic fisher - kolmogorov - petrovsky - piscounov ( sfkpp ) equation ( which may be obtained by the replacement @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ rft ] ) ) . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are parameters that characterize the diffusive growth of the particles . the structure of eq .",
    "( [ rft ] ) is very transparent : the first two terms represent the growing diffusion of the particles , characterized by the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the third term implements the recombination process and tames this growth when maximum occupancy is approached .",
    "the last term results from the stochastic dynamics , whose effect reflects the finiteness of the number of particles . note that this term gives rise to fluctuations in @xmath20 and , consequently , in the particle number @xmath9 , that are proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "this is typical of fluctuations of independent random numbers , and reflects well the statistical origin of this term .",
    "we do not mean that eq .",
    "( [ rft ] ) fully represents parton evolution .",
    "indeed , in the parton model , we anticipate that the rapidity evolution of parton densities be given , in the linear regime , by the bfkl equation , which is more complicated than a second order differential operator .",
    "but what we mean is that eq .",
    "( [ rft ] ) describes exactly the critical behavior of the qcd amplitude @xmath22 , that is its large rapidity ( time ) and large maximum occupancy number @xmath7 limit , up to the replacement of the relevant parameters .",
    "all higher order operators beyond the ones appearing in eq .",
    "( [ rft ] ) are irrelevant in these limits . as for the linear part , this is clear : the large time behavior stems from a saddle point that selects the quadratic approximation to the growing diffusion kernel . as a matter of fact , any equation of the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is an appropriate differential or integral kernel encoding the growing diffusion , is believed to belong to that universality class and hence to exhibit the same asymptotic solutions . by `` appropriate '' we mean in practice that the phase velocity @xmath25 of a wave of wave number @xmath26 propagated by the linear part of eq .",
    "( [ rftk ] ) , must be a function of @xmath26 that has a minimum in its domain of analyticity , but we should also stress that a general mathematical definition of the universality class of the reggeon field equation is still not available  @xcite . ) since @xmath24 would not be a proper diffusion kernel . however , it is possible to treat the running coupling through a generalization of the methods known to treat the sfkpp equation , as was done in the mean field case in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] as for the nonlinear part in eqs .",
    "( [ rft ] ) and ( [ rftk ] ) , terms of the form @xmath27 for @xmath28 would have no influence because the region @xmath29 in which these terms show up is absorptive @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we will see that the time evolution is essentially driven by the region where @xmath13 is small .",
    "thanks to this property , we will not have to bother about the exact way how parton saturation actually occurs in qcd : it is enough to know that there is an upper bound on the number of partons by unit of transverse phase space .",
    "so far , we have focused on the evolution of one ( partonic ) realization , described by eq .",
    "( [ rftk ] ) . in the qcd context",
    ", @xmath30 represents the scattering amplitude off one particular fock state .",
    "it is not a physical observable because it is not possible to select a particular fock state of the target in a particle physics experiment .",
    "the physical amplitude that is measured in an experiment is the average over all accessible random ( partonic ) realizations .",
    "only a few moments of @xmath8 may be measurable : its average , related to total cross sections , and its variance , related to diffractive cross sections , namely : @xmath31 the evolution of the moments of @xmath8 ( or of @xmath13 ) may be computed directly from eq .",

    "( [ noise ] ) : @xmath34    and so on for the higher order correlators , leading eventually to an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations .",

    "( [ hierarchy2 ] ) ) could not be obtained from the reggeon action through the parisi - zhang procedure : indeed , they refer explicitly to the way one counts the objects , as can be seen from the fact that this term is proportional to @xmath35 , and the knowledge of the evolution encoded in the bulk terms of the action they had used is not enough .    due to universality of the asymptotics of reaction - diffusion processes , it is straightforward to take over eq .",
    "( [ rftk ] ) or equivalently eqs .",
    "( [ hierarchy1 ] ) and ( [ hierarchy2 ] ) ( and the higher equations in this hierarchy ) , together with their _ exact _ asymptotic solutions that will be exhibited in the following sections , to describe high energy qcd .",
    "basically , an elementary analysis of the parton splitting process and how the partons interact perturbatively with a probe will be enough .",
    "this will enable us to identify the variables @xmath36 and @xmath11 , the kernel of the linear evolution @xmath24 and the strength of the noise @xmath37 that correspond to the qcd parton model .",
    "we will turn to this analysis in the next section .    for eq .",
    "( [ rftk ] ) , being both explicitly nonlinear and stochastic , it proves a formidable task to find solutions .",
    "however , there has been much progress recently in this direction  @xcite .",
    "it was realized that , starting from a localized initial condition , the large time solution is a traveling wave moving in the direction of larger @xmath11 , up to some noise . the position @xmath38 of that wave may be defined in several ways .",
    "for example , one can pick a constant @xmath39 , and define @xmath38 in such a way that @xmath40 an alternative definition , useful in particular in the case of discrete models , could be @xmath41 in the context of qcd , @xmath38 is related to the saturation scale , that is , the point at which parton saturation effects set in .",
    "outstanding results have been obtained on @xmath38 and on the profile of the wave front @xmath20 in the region @xmath42 .",
    "an interesting point is that the analytical formulas depend only on some local properties of the characteristic function @xmath43 of the linear diffusion kernel .      in this section ,",
    "we review the discussion of ref .",
    "our goal is to identify the relevant variables @xmath36 , @xmath11 , @xmath7 and the evolution kernel @xmath24 that correspond to the physical situation of qcd .",
    "we consider the scattering of a dipole of variable size @xmath44 ( the probe ) off a dipole of size @xmath45 ( the target ) .",
    "a natural variable that will be used throughout is @xmath46 .",
    "we go to the rest frame of the probe so that the target carries all the available rapidity @xmath6 .",
    "the impact parameter @xmath47 between the dipoles is fixed .    at high energy , the quantum fluctuations of the target that interact with the probe",
    "are dominated by gluons .",
    "it proves useful to represent this set of partons by color dipoles @xcite .",
    "this is possible in the large-@xmath48 limit , where gluons are similar to zero - size @xmath49 pairs and non - planar diagrams are suppressed .",
    "subleading-@xmath48 terms do not contribute to the evolution of the scattering amplitudes when they are small .",
    "however , the dipole approximation breaks down when the amplitudes approach their unitarity limits at the same time as nonlinearities set in , but as we will see , that does not hamper getting the right asymptotics for the physical quantities that we are going to compute .",
    "we denote by @xmath50 the scattering amplitude of the probe off a given partonic realization @xmath51 of the target , obtained after a rapidity evolution @xmath6 ( the dependence on @xmath47 is understood ) .",
    "it is a random variable , whose probability distribution is related to the distribution of the different fock state realizations of the target .",
    "the values of @xmath50 range between 0 ( weak interaction ) and 1 ( unitarity limit ) .",
    "@xmath50 will be an essential intermediate quantity in our calculations , but as has been explained in sec .",
    "[ subsec_pm ] , it is not an observable . the physical dipole - dipole scattering amplitude @xmath52 is the statistical average over all partonic fluctuations of the target at rapidity @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath53 see eq .",
    "( [ crosssections ] ) .    when @xmath8 is small , the scattering amplitude off one particular fock state @xmath54 is the sum of all elementary amplitudes with each of the dipoles , i.e. @xmath55 where @xmath56 labels the dipoles in the fock state of the target at the time of the interaction .",
    "@xmath57 is the elementary dipole interaction and is essentially local in impact parameter .",
    "@xmath57 behaves like @xmath58 when the dipoles overlap , and vanishes otherwise .",
    "we have neglected @xmath59 factors and logarithms , but these approximations do not affect the results that we shall obtain , which are largely independent of the details .",
    "( [ tel ] ) shows that the amplitude @xmath50 is simply counting the number @xmath60 of dipoles of size @xmath44 within a disk of radius @xmath44 centered at the impact parameter of the external dipole : @xmath61 note that @xmath60 can take only discrete values :  indeed , it represents the number of quanta of a particular realization of the field of the target .",
    "the unitarity bound on @xmath8 implies that @xmath60 is also constrained by an upper bound @xmath62 .",
    "later on , we shall switch to momentum space by the fourier transformation @xmath63 .",
    "of course , the relationship  ( [ ndef ] ) will also hold for the fourier conjugates .",
    "we emphasize that the relationship  ( [ ndef ] ) is only valid within the framework of the above - mentioned approximations .",
    "a more accurate treatment of how the counting of the partons is actually realized in qcd would eventually lead to more complex equations , see ref .",
    "we will not enter these complications in this paper since we are only interested in the study of the asymptotics that are common with models from statistical physics , for which the counting rule  ( [ ndef ] ) is precise enough .",

    "may be derived in the same way .",
    "one gets @xmath69    which again calls for equations for higher correlators .",
    "( [ balitsky ] ) turn out to be the first two parts of an infinite hierarchy originally derived by balitsky  @xcite , restricted to dipoles .    in order to make the correspondence with reaction - diffusion models more concrete at the physical level",
    ", it is useful at this point to discuss qualitatively the typical shape of @xmath50 from the evolution .",

    "@xcite . ) as one takes a new step in rapidity , each of the dipoles @xmath70 already present in the wave function from the previous step and for which @xmath71 may split into two new dipoles .",
    "the most probable splittings are those in which both child dipoles have a size comparable to the size of the parent dipole : they occur with probability one in each interval @xmath72 .",
    "thus the main mechanism for the rise of @xmath73 with @xmath6 is a growing diffusion around the size of the initial dipole @xmath70 , that is encoded in the linear part of eqs .",
    "( [ balitsky ] ) .",
    "the nonlinear terms appearing therein tame this growth in order to satisfy the unitarity limits on @xmath74 .    in a typical partonic configuration as obtained after a sufficiently large rapidity evolution , the dipoles appear to be densely distributed around the size @xmath45 ( @xmath50 is large ) , but they become more rare with decreasing @xmath44 ( or increasing @xmath75 ) , and for sufficiently large @xmath75 one meets only rare fluctuations which involve one ( or few ) dipoles and for which @xmath76 .",
    "it is a wave front which with increasing @xmath6 progresses towards larger values of @xmath75 .",
    "the position of that front is characterized by a momentum scale @xmath77 called the saturation momentum .",
    "it is natural to define it e.g. by the value of the inverse dipole size for which the amplitude reaches some predefined number @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath78 : this corresponds to prescription  ( [ defpos1 ] ) .",
    "we now proceed to the identification of the qcd evolution equation to the reggeon field theory equation at the technical level . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we perform the transformation @xmath79 to momentum space .",
    "the main positive outcome of such a transformation is to make the nonlinear terms in eqs .",
    "( [ balitsky ] ) local in @xmath3 , while obviously the linear part stays an integral kernel .",
    "it leads to the formal simplification @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the eigenvalue of the bfkl kernel .",

    "however , this is not the physical solution that corresponds to scattering in qcd .",
    "the set of equations  ( [ balitskyk ] ) may be supplemented by boundary terms if one wants to represent explicitly the elementary dipole interaction ( i.e. the `` counting rule '' ) , which is absent in eq .",

    "the evolution equation for @xmath8 may also be written in the form of a stochastic differential equation , namely , @xmath89 that gives back the hierarchy  ( [ balitskyk ] ) for the correlators , supplemented with boundary terms such as  ( [ sourceterm ] ) .",
    "such a form was proposed for the first time in refs .",
    "@xcite on physical grounds :  indeed , this is the universal asymptotic form of the evolution of any reaction - diffusion type process @xcite .",
    "subsequently , it was shown on the technical level how the b - jimwlk formalism can be made consistent with these physics  @xcite , and how this term may describe pomeron loops ( see also refs .",
    "the source term  ( [ sourceterm ] ) corresponds exactly to the one found there .",
    "the identification with the reggeon field theory equation is now straightforward : @xmath90 let us discuss the validity of eq .",
    "( [ stochastic ] ) when applied to high energy scattering , and the physical expectations .",
    "as stated before , it is not expected to be exact , but we believe that it captures the essential physics of the qcd parton model .",
    "since the linear part drives the front propagation at high rapidity , and since it is taken exactly into account here ( to leading order in @xmath91 ) , we expect that the solutions to this equation match the asymptotics of full qcd as far as the position of the front is concerned .",
    "this means that one should be able to get the asymptotics of the moments of the saturation scale @xmath92 for @xmath6 large , @xmath93 , and at a fixed impact parameter by solving  ( [ stochastic ] ) .",
    "the latter limitations are necessary for the counting rule  ( [ ndef ] ) to be valid .",
    "similarly , the shape of @xmath8 in the region @xmath94 is known to be universal and hence should also be obtainable from eq .",
    "( [ stochastic ] ) .    of course , strictly speaking , these statements have the status of a conjecture , that will have to be confirmed by accurate numerical calculations , and in the long term , by a better mathematical understanding of the solutions of equations of the form  ( [ stochastic ] ) .",
    "there is still some important difference between the original reggeon field theory equation  ( [ rft ] ) and the equation that we have obtained for high energy qcd .",
    "indeed , @xmath95 is not a fixed point of the qcd evolution , unlike the case of the original reggeon field theory equation , so the solutions can not match in that region .",

    "but anyway , we would not solve eq .",
    "( [ stochastic ] ) around @xmath97 because in the qcd case , the nonlinearity can not be reduced to a simple quadratic term as in  ( [ stochastic ] ) , since also color structures beyond dipoles are expected to play a role there @xcite .",
    "that does presumably not influence the asymptotic saturation scale , which is completely determined by the linear part of the evolution equation , but it certainly modifies the shape of @xmath8 and of its correlators close to the unitarity limits .",
    "the mean field approximation @xmath98 casts eq .",
    "( [ balitsky ] ) into a closed form , known as the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite : @xmath99 a priori , the validity condition for such an approximation is not clear",
    ". we will be able to assess it only by studying the full problem including fluctuations .",
    "it is nevertheless useful to start with such an approximation because it is tractable both analytically and numerically , and because the full stochastic solution is nothing else than a perturbation of the mean field solution .",
    "it has recently been understood @xcite that the bk equation belongs to the universality class of the fkpp equation , and as such , it admits a family of traveling wave solutions @xcite .",
    "that is , there exists a function of the rapidity @xmath77 such that @xmath100 is a solution to eq .",

    "note that the general traveling wave property  ( [ twave ] ) is equivalent to geometric scaling , a feature of the data for @xmath106 scattering at high energy discovered a few years ago @xcite .",
    "the crucial point is that the properties of these traveling waves are to a large extent determined by the large-@xmath3 tail , where the amplitude @xmath107 is small and thus where eq .",

    "the reduced front for @xmath253 exhibits the typical gaussian shape that is expected from a mean field evolution , as in eq .",

    "the fact that the matching is not perfect in the large @xmath236 tail is consistent with our findings of sec .",

    "the result is displayed on fig .",
    "[ vmv0 ] , together with the analytical expectation .",
    "we see that asymptotically , the numerical calculation approaches slowly the analytical formula ( [ velocitybd ] ) obtained from the mean field equation with a cutoff ( obtained through the brunet  derrida procedure  ( [ bdtrick ] ) and leading to eqs .",

    "the agreement is actually good . for the values of @xmath7 of interest for qcd , typically @xmath257 ,",
    "the analytical calculation is quite far from the numerical calculation .",
    "however , as can be seen on the figure , the discrepancy amounts essentially to a slowly varying function of @xmath7 .",
    "note that the curve approaches the asymptote from below , which means that the average velocity is always _ larger _ than the result from the mean field calculation with a cutoff .",
    "this can be understood from our previous discussion and from figs .",
    "[ velocity2 ] and  [ velocity3 ] : the fluctuations neglected in the brunet - derrida procedure pull the front ahead of its mean position , and the discrepancy seen on fig .",
    "[ vmv0 ] may be traced to the large fluctuations in the instantaneous velocity .",
    "no more quantitative understanding of these deviations has been achieved up to now .",
    "we have also plotted on the same figure the result of a calculation in which the evolution equation is mean field everywhere , except for the foremost bin , as explained in the introduction to this section .",
    "we see an almost perfect matching with the fully stochastic model , except for very small values of @xmath7 : this confirms the observation in @xcite that essentially , only the stochasticity in the rightmost bin plays a role .",
    "however , the discrepancy at small @xmath7 indicates a breaking of universality : the details of the model clearly start to enter .",
    "so far , we have followed the evolution of one single realization .",
    "each such realization undergoes a stochastic evolution given by eqs .",
    "( [ stochatoy])-([stocharule ] ) . at each time",

    "[ subsec_numsol ] , the average @xmath259 exhibits the @xmath36-dependence given by eq .",
    "( [ velocitybd ] ) . however , since the actual evolution is stochastic , the front position @xmath38 undergoes a random walk about its mean @xmath260 , and @xmath38 gets a variance @xmath261 .",
    "this fact may be understood qualitatively in the following way .",
    "most of the time , the front moves forward in @xmath11 through a deterministic time evolution of its bulk , which has width @xmath262 .",
    "but it may happen stochastically that several bins get successively filled by particles much ahead of the front .",
    "those particles will then diffuse and multiply , and eventually form a new front that will be ahead of the old `` deterministic '' one .",
    "the net effect is a jump in the front velocity , one of those that can be seen on figs .",
    "[ velocity2 ] ,  [ velocity3 ] .",
    "this phenomenon is of diffusive nature , thus we eventually expect the dispersion @xmath261 of the positions of the front to be proportional to @xmath36 , as in eq .",
    "( [ sigma2xt ] ) .",
    "we generate 1000 realizations of the stochastic evolution of our initial condition over the time intervals up to @xmath263 and @xmath264 respectively .",
    "the dispersion of the front positions is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ front4 ] .",
    "we see that there is roughly a factor of @xmath265 in the dispersions between the two considered times , in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ sigma2xt ] ) .",
    "each of these realizations exhibits a universal exponential shape  ( [ front ] ) in the leading edge region , up to small fluctuations concentrated essentially in the tip .",
    "however , when taking the average , the curves for different times do not superimpose anymore , as seen in the insert of fig .",
    "[ front4 ] . of course",
    ", this is due to the dispersion in the position of the front  ( [ sigma2xt ] ) .",
    "now we may compute numerically the quantity @xmath266 to check the scaling form  ( [ sigma2xt ] ) ,  ( [ scaling ] ) .",
    "the result is displayed in fig .",
    "[ sigma ] .",
    "we see again a good agreement with the expectations for large values of @xmath7 .",
    "note that again , the @xmath267 prediction overestimates the numerical calculation for smaller @xmath7 .",
    "we have displayed on the same plot the result of the numerical calculation in the simplified model where stochastic effects are concentrated in the rightmost bin .",
    "we see again that this model gives the same result as the complete one .",
    "the discrepancies at large @xmath7 are statistical fluctuations , due to the fact that the plotted curve results from an average over a finite number of realizations ( about 1000 here ) .",
    "the higher moments are more and more sensitive to such fluctuations .",
    "they should disappear when the averaging is done with more realizations .",
    "so far in this section , we have discussed exclusively the toy model .",
    "let us come back to the case of qcd .",
    "the analytical results ( [ shapebd])-([scaling ] ) illustrated on the toy model studied in the previous section are readily taken over to qcd using tab .  [ dictionary ] .",
    "we list them here for completeness .",
    "the scattering amplitude off a single partonic realization , which is not the physical observable , but is nevertheless an important intermediate quantity , reads @xmath268 up to fluctuations . note that this formula is only valid in the window @xmath269 .",
    "the mean dependence of the saturation scale on rapidity reads , asymptotically for large rapidities @xmath270 and its variance @xmath271 which , together with eq .",
    "( [ shapeqcd ] ) , yields the asymptotic scaling form @xmath272 this last formula quantifies the magnitude of the violations of geometric scaling .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ dqsdyqcd ] ) was first obtained in ref .",
    "a violation of geometric scaling was also found there , but the square root was missing in the denominator of the argument of @xmath273 in eq .",
    "( [ scalingqcd ] ) .",
    "the formulas above are valid as long as @xmath274 , and asymptotically for @xmath275 . for @xmath276 instead , we have shown that fluctuations do not play a role , and the mean field discussion of sec .",
    "[ sec_meanfield ] applies .",
    "this point is particularly clear in fig .",
    "[ front3 ] and figs .",
    "[ velocity3 ] ,  [ velocity2 ] .",
    "the kinematical regime @xmath276 is a window where geometric scaling should be at work .",
    "the results obtained here are exact results of qcd .",
    "they are valid for very small values of @xmath277 , where perturbation theory is justified .",
    "so the weak noise limit @xmath278 or @xmath275 that we have considered here is the consistent expansion .",
    "actually , as the front of the amplitude travels towards larger values of the momenta , one should take into account the running of the coupling , but this is just a ( substantial ! ) technical complication which does not change qualitatively the picture .",
    "let us discuss now the validity of our results for real world qcd . as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ vmv0 ] and  [ sigma ] , the numerical calculations get relatively close to the asymptotics at least up to a constant of order 1 , for say @xmath279 , which corresponds to @xmath280 .",
    "realistic attainable values of @xmath277 in physics experiments are @xmath281 .",
    "this situation would rather correspond to a strong noise limit @xmath282 for which , unfortunately , no predictive theory has yet been found .",
    "in this paper , we focused on the statistical approach to high energy qcd , that we have developed and illustrated .",
    "we have shown that it provides a very simple picture for high energy scattering , relying directly on the qcd parton model .",
    "it allows a derivation from first principles of the most sophisticated analytic results that have been obtained so far for scattering amplitudes at fixed impact parameter .",
    "the simplicity of this approach is the consequence of a deep physical connection between the parton model and reaction - diffusion processes .",
    "its main interest is to gain a simple physical understanding of the fluctuations present in the extended b - jimwlk equations , and to enable a clear derivation of the universal asymptotics of the scattering amplitudes at high energy .",
    "we have also solved numerically the qcd evolution equations in the context of a mean field approximation , that leads to the bk equation .",
    "we have confirmed that the bk equation admits traveling waves , and studied their formation starting with different physical initial conditions , with different definitions of the saturation scale .",
    "the numerical results have been compared to the most recent analytical predictions , and a good agreement has been found at all levels , for large enough values of the rapidity . we have also emphasized the role of the different parts of the kernel .    to go beyond the mean field approximation to high energy scattering ,",
    "we have proposed and solved a toy model that captures the essential features of the full qcd evolution .",
    "the advantages of studying a toy model are numerous : in particular , it is simple enough to allow for light and flexible numerical simulations .",
    "consequently the universal properties of the solution can be quite easily studied .",
    "we have investigated some of these properties , confirming former numerical studies on different models in the same universality class .",
    "we have investigated how the asymptotics set in .",
    "one of the important conclusions of this paper is that in the initial stages of the evolution , the mean field solution applies .",
    "we believe that many features would still deserve to be investigated within such simplified models : for example , the effect of the running coupling would be crucial both for phenomenology and for full consistency of the approach , that relies on a small-@xmath277 asymptotic expansion .",
    "this case would correspond to reaction - diffusion in an inhomogeneous medium , which in particular allows for a variable maximum of particles per site .",
    "obviously , going beyond the leading orders in rapidity and in @xmath277 will start to be model dependent ( i.e. non - universal ) at some order , and the complications and specificities of qcd ( color , 2-dimensional impact parameter space ) will show up in the evolution equations .",
    "the same is true if one wants to give up the coarse - graining in impact parameter  @xcite .",
    "the solutions to the more refined equations , that is the further terms in the asymptotic expansions we have considered , will probably be difficult to obtain from the analogy with statistical mechanics that we have extensively used in this paper .",
    "* note added : * while this work was being completed , the paper @xcite appeared , that also deals with numerical solutions of qcd at high energies including fluctuations .",
    "the numerical results obtained are complementary to ours since the attitude of the author is to focus on values of @xmath7 realistic in the context of qcd , rather than emphasizing the connection to the analytical results obtained on equations in the universality class of the sfkpp equation .",
