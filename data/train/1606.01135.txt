[ fig : zero_field]b shows the spectrum obtained for detection of the @xmath4  component of the resulting emission , while the red curve shows the spectrum of the @xmath5  component .",
    "the integrated pl intensity @xmath6 of the @xmath4  component of the wz free exciton is much stronger than its counter - polarized component  @xmath7 , revealing significant circular polarization of the luminescence of the wz gaas nw in the absence of an external magnetic field .",
    "the corresponding degree of circular polarization , defined as @xmath8 , reaches .",
    "note that , in contrast , the substrate - related peak shows no significant circular polarization .",
    "the large degree of circular polarization of the characteristic nw emission is a strong indication of efficient optical injection of spins into the wire .",
    "an optically injected spin ensemble should be depolarized by spin precession when applying an external transverse magnetic field ( hanle effect@xcite ) , according to@xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the degree of polarization at zero magnetic field and @xmath11 is the effective spin lifetime , which is given by the inverse sum of the electron lifetime @xmath12 and the spin relaxation time @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is the larmor spin precession frequency induced by the external magnetic field  @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the bohr magneton , @xmath17 is the transverse effective electron @xmath18-factor , and @xmath19 is the reduced planck constant .    ) .",
    "the schematic measurement configuration is superimposed.[fig : hanle ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : hanle ] we thus plot the experimentally determined degree of circular polarization of the wz free exciton as a function of the magnitude of external magnetic field applied perpendicularly to the nw axis .",
    "in addition , the red curve represents a fit of the hanle function to our data .",
    "the excellent agreement of data and fit represents clear evidence for the successful optical injection of a spin ensemble into the single nw .",
    "however , without knowing the @xmath18-factor of wz gaas , the time - integrated hanle measurements can not be used for quantitative determination of relaxation times of the spin - polarized electron ensemble in the nw .",
    "the dynamics of such a spin ensemble can be accessed in time - resolved -pl  ( trpl ) experiments .",

    "figure  [ fig : spin_dynamics]a depicts typical time - resolved spin polarization transients of a single , free - standing wz gaas nw for externally applied transverse magnetic fields @xmath20 from 0 up to .",
    "while for @xmath21 the decay is characterized by a single exponential , two main features arise as soon as an external magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the nw axis .",
    "first , we observe a characteristic oscillatory behavior with increasing frequency for increasing @xmath20 , and second , a significantly steeper slope of the envelope compared to the zero field transient .",
    "the oscillations in the spin polarization transients arise from spins precessing around the external magnetic field @xmath22 with a frequency corresponding to the larmor frequency @xmath23 . according to the optical selection rules",
    ", the precession around @xmath22 leads to a periodic change between @xmath4 and @xmath5  polarized luminescence and consequently to the oscillations in the spin polarization transients .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath24 are extracted from the fits and plotted in fig .",

    "this value is remarkably different from its zincblende counterpart ( i.e. , @xmath26)@xcite .",
    "the second observation we make is a significantly faster decay of the spin polarization transients for @xmath27 . since the temporal decay of the spin polarization transients",
    "is directly linked to electron spin relaxation , the considerably slower decay of the zero field trace as compared to the envelope for @xmath27 reflects a distinct increase of spin relaxation in the presence of a transverse magnetic field . to quantify this effect , we determined the corresponding spin relaxation times @xmath28  ( @xmath21 ) and @xmath29  ( @xmath27 ) by fitting the polarization transients to a monoexponential decay @xmath30 for zero magnetic field and to a damped cosine @xmath31 for @xmath27 , respectively , for several nws .",
    "figure  [ fig : spin_dynamics]c exemplarily presents the magnetic field dependence of @xmath13 for a single , free - standing nw in transverse magnetic fields up to .",
    "all measured nws qualitatively show the same behavior : the initially long spin relaxation time @xmath32 drops to a substantially reduced value @xmath33 in the presence of a transverse magnetic field , analogously to the anisotropic spin dephasing found in @xmath34 gaas quantum wells@xcite .",
    "the observed reduction of the spin relaxation time in an external field in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin_dynamics]c therefore reflects an intrinsic spin relaxation anisotropy in wz gaas nws : spins pointing along the nw axis ( @xmath35 wz @xmath36-direction ) relax remarkably slower than spins perpendicular to the @xmath36-axis .",
    "this peculiar magnetic field dependence is counterintuitive when compared to previously reported experiments on spin dynamics in related bulk wz gan structures@xcite . in these bulk",
    "gan samples , using a similar measurement configuration , an increase of the spin relaxation time is observed when a transverse magnetic field is applied . in order to resolve this puzzle , we present in the next section a model for the anomalous nw spin dynamics developed in the framework of dp spin relaxation@xcite , involving the interface contributions to spin  orbit coupling at the nw sidewall facets .",
    "implying dp spin relaxation , which dominates the spin dephasing of free , delocalized electrons in most iii  v semiconductor bulk and nano ",
    "heterostructure samples@xcite , the effect of soc on the relaxation time @xmath13 for a given spin component can be described by@xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the mean square effective magnetic field in the plane perpendicular to the considered spin direction and @xmath39 is the momentum relaxation time for an individual electron .",
    "as can be seen from equation  ( [ eq : dp_spin_relax_time ] ) , the dp spin relaxation time sensitively depends on the explicit form of the effective , @xmath40-dependent magnetic field @xmath41 .",
    "since the diameter of the nw core is large enough to exclude the effects of electron confinement , the inversion asymmetry of the bulk wz crystal structure determines the form of the intrinsic effective magnetic field@xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 $ ] ( @xmath36-axis ) , @xmath44 $ ] and @xmath45 $ ] ( cf .",
    "[ fig : sem]c ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath46 is an effective soc parameter describing the total magnitude of the so field in bulk wz ( see supplementary note  1 ) .",
    "the orientation of @xmath47 is schematically depicted as blue arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] . for @xmath21 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : model]a , the spin ensemble @xmath48 is optically generated along @xmath49 .",
    "since the intrinsic magnetic field @xmath47 which induces a relaxation of @xmath48 contains no @xmath49-component , the relaxation is maximized .",
    "however , if an external magnetic field is applied transversely to the initial @xmath50orientation of the spin ensemble , e.g. @xmath51 , larmor precession induced by this external field leads to a rotation of the spin ensemble into the @xmath52plane , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : model]b",
    ". then , @xmath48 contains only @xmath53- and @xmath49-components .",
    "since @xmath54 can not act on the @xmath53-component of the spin ensemble and , furthermore , @xmath55 , the dp mechanism will be less efficient than for the initial situation with @xmath21 . as a consequence , the spin relaxation time @xmath29 is expected to be longer than @xmath28 , which has been confirmed experimentally in bulk wz gan samples@xcite .",
    "the bulk soc leads to a magnetic field dependence of the spin relaxation time that is opposite to the results from the nws and is therefore not capable of explaining the observed spin relaxation in our nws .",
    "note , however , that in addition to the intrinsic so field @xmath47 , there also exists a contribution to the soc resulting from the asymmetry of the gaas / algaas core / shell interface , which is determined by the presence of different atoms at each side of the heterointerface and the corresponding band discontinuities@xcite .",
    "although often neglected in bulk and symmetric quantum well samples , these interfacial contributions can be on the same scale as those associated with bulk and structure inversion asymmetry , as demonstrated by recent calculations of the soc parameters of electrons at a single , atomically sharp gaas / algaas heterointerface@xcite .",
    "hexagonal core / shell nws provide six of these interfaces and a very high ratio of interface area to volume .",
    "consequently , these interfacial soc effects will be particularly large in such nws , provided that the electron phase coherence length is smaller than the nw diameter , a situation frequently encountered in vapor  liquid  solid grown nws .",
    "since we do not observe any signatures of spatial quantum confinement , this latter condition is met in our nws .",
    "the appropriate form of the interface - induced effective magnetic field , @xmath56 , depends on the crystallographic orientation at the gaas / algaas core / shell heterointerfaces .",
    "our wz gaas nws exhibit a typical hexagonal cross section with six equivalent @xmath57 sidewall facets , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sem]c . from a symmetry analysis at the respective core / shell interfaces at these facets ,",
    "we derive that @xmath56 will always lie in the plane of the core / shell interface and is perpendicular to @xmath40 .",
    "in addition , the soc arising from one interface is of the @xmath58-linear rashba - type .",
    "we find this relationship to be equivalent for all six nw sidewall facets .",
    "we thus exemplarily discuss the impact of @xmath56 at facet @xmath59 oriented along the @xmath60-direction , a complete evaluation for all facets is given in the supplementary note  2 . at this @xmath59 facet ,",
    "we obtain @xmath61 . taking this additional contribution into account , we modify the total effective magnetic field induced by soc to the expression @xmath62 where the coefficients @xmath63 and @xmath64 are effective soc parameters determining the strength of the interfacial contribution parallel and perpendicular to the wz @xmath36-axis , respectively",
    ". remarkably , due to the low symmetry @xmath57 nw sidewall facets of the @xmath65 point group , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are linearly independent@xcite , while the size of the bulk contribution is given by the single parameter @xmath46 .",
    "the additive action of both soc - induced fields , @xmath47 and @xmath56 , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : model]c and d. an important observation is that the bulk effective field ( blue arrows as in fig .  [",
    "fig : model]a , b ) lies in the @xmath66plane , while the effective field resulting from the heterointerface ( red arrows ) lies in the @xmath52plane , for our example of the facet @xmath59 .",
    "thus , compared to the pure bulk situation sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : model]a and b , in the nws the core / shell interface obviously introduces a non - zero @xmath49component to the total effective magnetic field .",
    "this particular component may now alter the relaxation time of the spin ensemble @xmath48 .",
    "in addition , when @xmath63 and @xmath64 are different , the magnitude of the effective magnetic field components due to interface inversion asymmetry differs for @xmath53 and @xmath49 .",
    "this is illustrated through different vector norms of the @xmath56 components in fig .",
    "[ fig : model]c and d , in contrast to the constant vector norms of the contributions from @xmath47 .",
    "let us first consider the case @xmath67 and @xmath68 . as a consequence ,",
    "the magnitude of the interface - induced effective magnetic field is stronger in @xmath49 than in @xmath53direction .",
    "it is also larger than the magnitude of the effective magnetic field due to soc in bulk .",
    "this situation is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : model]c and d. for @xmath21 , the spin ensemble @xmath48 is optically generated along @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the largest component of @xmath69 is parallel to @xmath48 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model]c , and can not contribute to the spin relaxation .",
    "however , as soon as an external magnetic field induces a precession of the spin ensemble , this large component of @xmath69 starts to act on @xmath48 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : model]d , and will quickly dominate the relaxation . as a consequence , the spin relaxation time @xmath29 will then be shorter than @xmath28 .",
    "this precisely describes our experimental findings discussed in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin_dynamics]c . if however , we consider all the other possible relations of @xmath70 and @xmath46 , they impose @xmath71 . this relation is observed in the bulk wz material @xcite and is opposite to the results of our study .    our model thus not only supplies a picture for the experimental observations , but also provides information on the relationships of the three effective soc parameters .",
    "taking into account the complete evaluation for all nw sidewall facets developed in the supplementary note  2 we find @xmath72 which implies that the interface - induced @xmath50-contribution to the effective so field @xmath41 is significantly larger than the @xmath60@xmath73-contributions from both bulk ( @xmath68 ) and the interfaces ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "in conclusion , our study on gaas nws provides insight both into the specific wz gaas / algaas system and , more fundamentally , into the soc of a core / shell nw . to create a spin ensemble ,",
    "we have demonstrated efficient optical spin injection into single free - standing nws .",
    "we determined the effective @xmath18-factor in the hexagonal wz phase of gaas to be @xmath25 and obtained long spin relaxation times up to in our wz gaas nws .",
    "a more fundamental implication emerges from the peculiar dynamics of spin relaxation in the nw core / shell structure .",
    "our study suggests that a dominant contribution to soc originates from the nw core / shell interface , which , by its nature , breaks the symmetry of the bulk lattice .",
    "for the common situation of the transport phase coherence length being shorter than the diameter of the nw , the presence of the interface will strongly modify the soc .",
    "we believe that this effect plays an important role in experiments , where high soc in a semiconductor nw is required . beyond that , it could offer an opportunity to tune the soc in semiconductor heterostructures and hybrid structures by choosing proper crystallographic orientations and material compositions of heterointerfaces .",
    "the investigated gaas / algaas core / shell nws were synthesized by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) using the au - assisted vapor  liquid  solid growth mechanism@xcite on gaas@xmath74 substrates covered with  au . by tuning of mbe growth parameters , the crystalline structure was optimized to produce nominally undoped nws with a defect - free , pure wz gaas phase over lengths of several ( see supplementary fig .  1 ) .",
    "growth for 125  min using a ga deposition rate of and an adjusted as@xmath75 beam equivalent pressure of resulted in nws grown along the wz @xmath36-axis with a length of and a core diameter of . in order to disable the dominant nonradiative recombination at the bare gaas surface@xcite",
    ", the nws were passivated with a uniform @xmath76 shell with a thickness of , ensuring intense and robust pl of the gaas core .",
    "this shell was surrounded by a gaas cap , which protects the @xmath76 layer from oxidation@xcite and allows for optical measurements of the same nws over weeks without any deterioration .",
    "combined -pl and transmission electron microscopic studies performed on single wires showed that the nws produced provide a pure wz crystal structure and are of very high crystalline and optical quality@xcite .",
    "after growth , the nw areal density was initially reduced by an ultrasonic bath dip and then patterns were created on the sample , which permits us to identify and optically study individual free - standing nws .",
    "we first performed spatially resolved -pl area scans in order to preselect single nws with highest crystalline purity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zero_field]b ) .",
    "the nws of interest were then individually further investigated by polarization- and time - resolved -pl before characterizing their structural properties with scanning electron microscopy .",
    "the pl and trpl measurements were conducted at in a confocal configuration , where both the excitation and collection beams were parallel to the sample normal and along the nw axes ( fig .  [ fig : zero_field]a ) .",
    "single free - standing nws were excited with the emission line  ( ) of a semiconductor laser diode operating in continuous - wave or pulsed mode ( pulses at a repetition rate of ) , which was chosen to be near - resonant in order to solely induce the heavy hole states - to - conduction band transition in the wz gaas core@xcite .",
    "the laser light was focused down to the sample using a @xmath77 microscope objective with @xmath78 that provides a minimum spot diameter of around .",
    "the emitted pl was collected along the nw axis by the same objective and imaged onto the entrance slit of a grating spectrometer .",
    "time - integrated -pl spectra were acquired using a cooled charge coupled device , while trpl signals were detected by a hamamatsu streak camera system with a time resolution of .",
    "for the optical orientation experiments the incident near - resonant excitation was @xmath4  circularly polarized , which , according to the wz optical interband selection rules@xcite , injects spin - polarized carriers in the gaas nw core where the light is absorbed .",
    "these carriers recombine to produce polarized luminescence , which is resolved into right  ( @xmath6 ) and left  ( @xmath7 ) circularly polarized components , defining the degree of circular polarization : @xmath8 .",
    "the hanle effect and time - resolved -pl measurements were performed by mounting the sample between the coils of an electromagnet , where magnetic fields up to could be applied in the sample plane perpendicular to the nw axes .",
