    "a body moving in a background medium loses momentum due to its gravitational interaction with its own gravitationally induced wake .",
    "this process is often referred to as dynamical friction .",
    "chandrasekhar ( 1943 ) estimated the dynamical friction on a massive particle passing through a homogeneous and isotropic background of light stars . in the case where the perturber moves in a gaseous medium , the gravitational drag",
    "is traditionally inferred as the gravitational attraction between the perturber and its own wake . in this approach , the density structure of the wake",
    "is derived in linear perturbation theory by assuming that the body produces a small perturbation in the ambient medium ( dokuchaev 1964 ; ruderman & spiegel 1971 ; just & kegel 1990 ; ostriker 1999 ; kim & kim 2007 ; snchez - salcedo 2009 ; namouni 2010 ) . for a perturber moving on a rectilinear orbit at constant velocity ,",
    "the steady - state linear theory predicts that the drag force vanishes for subsonic perturbers , while it becomes similar to the collisionless drag force for supersonic bodies .",
    "ostriker ( 1999 ) considered the linear - theory drag as a time - dependent rather than steady state problem and arrived at the following formula for the gravitational drag force , @xmath5 the perturber of mass @xmath0 , which moves at velocity @xmath1 and mach number @xmath6 in a rectilinear orbit through a homogeneous medium with density @xmath2 and sound speed @xmath7 , is assumed to be formed at @xmath8 .",
    "the minimum radius @xmath3 is the typical size of the perturber .",
    "this formula has enjoyed widespread theoretical application ( narayan 2000 ; escala et al .  2004 ; kim 2007 ; conroy & ostriker 2008 ; villaver & livio 2009 ; tanaka & haiman 2009 ; nejad - asghar 2010 ; chavarra et al .",
    "because of the linear - theory assumption , the above equation is properly valid only at @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the bondi - hoyle radius ( @xmath11 $ ] ) .",
    "therefore , equation ( [ eq : ostriker99 ] ) is strictly valid for extended perturbers with a softening radius much larger than the bondi - hoyle radius .",
    "in fact , for extended perturbers , snchez - salcedo & brandenburg ( 1999 ) found good agreement between the gravitational drag in full hydrodynamical simulations and ostriker s formula .",
    "in particular , for plummer perturbers with softening radius @xmath12 much larger than @xmath13 , they found that @xmath14 .",
    "an extension of ostriker s formula for extended bodies orbiting in a stratified gaseous sphere was given in snchez - salcedo & brandenburg ( 2001 ) .",
    "in the case of point - like perturbers , like massive black holes , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath3 should be of the order of a few @xmath10 , but a nonlinear analysis is required to fix the uncertainty in the definition of @xmath3 . in adiabatic simulations of axisymmetric accretion flows past a gravitating absorbing object , shima et al .",
    "( 1985 ) computed the drag by considering two contributions : the aerodynamic force , which is due to the accretion of momentum over the body surface , and the gravitational force on the perturber by its own wake .",
    "they found that the numerical results were consistent with the estimates in linear theory .",
    "the problem of the gravitational drag on a point - mass particle has revived new interest to estimate the timescale of the orbital decay of massive black hole binary in the centre of galaxies .",
    "escala et al .",
    "( 2004 ) simulated the orbital decay of a single black hole moving initially on a circular orbit in an isothermal gaseous sphere .",
    "they found that the gravitational drag is less peaked at @xmath15 than predicted by ostriker s formula with @xmath16 .",
    "tanaka & haiman ( 2009 ) combined the prescriptions of ostriker ( 1999 ) and escala et al .",
    "( 2004 ) into a formula that is used as a prescription of the gaseous drag on black holes in numerical simulations .",
    "in order to isolate the physical reason of the failure of ostriker s formula , kim & kim ( 2009 ) and kim ( 2010 ) carried out axisymmetrical simulations of a massive body in rectilinear orbit with different values of the strength of the gravitational perturbation due to the body as measured by @xmath17 where @xmath12 is the softening radius of the plummer perturber .",
    "they find that the functional form of the gravitational drag is not so peaked as the linear theory predicts and conclude that the discrepancy between the numerical and ostriker results are most likely due to the nonlinear effect .",
    "it is important to note that in the simulations of escala et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , kim & kim ( 2009 ) and kim ( 2010 ) , the perturber simply provides a smooth gravitational potential and does not hold any absorbing surface . without any absorbing inner boundary condition ,",
    "a hydrostatic envelope with front - back symmetry is formed near the perturber .",
    "because of the front - back symmetry , this large envelope provides a negligible contribution to the gravitational drag force .",
    "however , it is well - known that accretion is a crucial ingredient in point - like objects , such as black holes or stars .",
    "different boundary conditions in the high density region of the wake are expected to change the gas dynamics near the perturber and the strength of the gravitational drag ( e.g. , fryxell et al .",
    "1987 ; naiman et al .  2011 ) .",
    "for example , ruffert ( 1996 ) simulated a 3d quasi - isothermal flow with an absorbing boundary surrounding the point - like object .",
    "moeckel & throop ( 2009 ) carried out similar simulations , but then also included an accretion disk orbiting the point source .",
    "the aim of this paper is to describe the contribution of the nonlinear inner wake to the gravitational drag on hypersonic perturbers by using the ballistic orbit theory ( bondi & hoyle 1944 ; lyttleton 1972 ; bisnovatyi - kogan et al .  1979 ) .",
    "whereas this theory ( the so - called model of line - accretion ) has been extensively used as a powerful framework to describe the gravitational interaction between a moving massive body and the surrounding gaseous medium in the context of supersonic bondi - hoyle - lyttleton accretion ( e.g. , koide et al .",
    "1991 ; edgar 2004 ) , it has been traditionally ignored as a tool to quantify the gravitational drag . in fact , all analytical studies about the gravitational drag in gaseous media have been based on the linear perturbation theory , following on the analysis of dokuchaev ( 1964 ) , ruderman & spiegel ( 1971 ) and rephaeli & salpeter ( 1980 ) . in this paper",
    "we develop the ballistic orbit theory to provide analytical expressions of , not only the mass accretion rate , but also the nonlinear drag force on a hypersonic compact body .",
    "these estimates will be compared with numerical results of an axisymmetric isothermal hydrodynamical simulation .",

    "we present an analytic model for the flow generated by a point mass moving hypersonically within a homogeneous environment .",
    "this model is based on the ballistic orbit theory ( see , e.  g. , bisnovatyi - kogan et al .  1979 ) , and is developed so as to obtain analytic expressions for the mass accretion rate and the non - linear gravitational drag . since we include the contribution of the non - linear inner wake , there is no ambiguity in the definition of the minimum cut - off distance of the interaction , which turns out to be @xmath132 .",

    "this result in principle differs from the one of moekel & throop ( 2009 ) , who obtain a significantly lower value for the accretion rate from their numerical simulation .",
    "the fact that we obtain a better agreement could be due to the considerably higher resolution of our simulation , or to the fact that we carry out a much longer time - integration ( extending to @xmath133 , compared to @xmath134 for the simulation of moekel & throop 2009 ) .",

    "there are several possible sources for this discrepancy between the analytic and numerical drag forces .",
    "it appears that the limited numerical resolution of the simulation is not responsible for this effect , because we have repeated the simulation at @xmath136 and @xmath137 of the resolution ( of the simulation presented in section 4 ) and obtain basically the same drag force .",
    "a possible source of the differences between the analytic and numerical @xmath121 is the fact that the simulation has a finite mach number ( @xmath138 for the upstream flow , see section 4 ) , while the analytic model essentially has an infinite mach number ( i.e. , zero gas pressure ) .",
    "another difference is that the numerical simulation has a rather broad wake region , while in the analytic solution it is assumed that the tail occupies a very narrow region surrounding the symmetry axis .",
    "a third difference is that while in the analytic model the perturbed environmental gas effectively extends to infinity , the numerical simulation of course is carried out in a finite domain ( see section 4 ) . given these clear differences between the numerical and analytic models , the agreement that we find between the two can be regarded as quite successful .",
    "in this paper we have therefore derived an analytic recipe for the drag force @xmath121 ( from a ballistic flow model ) , which is successfully reproduced by an axisymmetric numerical simulation .",
    "this recipe for @xmath121 will be useful for carrying out simulations of compact bodies in motions influenced by gravitational drag .",
