    "the direction of gravity , in both senses of the word , is a key characteristic of the universe .",
    "the revolution of the late 1990s was the discovery that gravity did not exclusively pull down in the conventional , attractive way but that cosmic expansion showed an acceleration equivalent to gravity pulling outward .",
    "secondly , gravitation plays the major role in directing the contents of the universe , bending the paths of light and governing the growth of large scale structure .",
    "a new frontier has opened in exploring the force of gravity , understanding not only its spatial direction but its direction of energy and mass in the sense of a conductor directing an orchestra .",
    "some outstanding questions now being addressed include : why is gravity pulling outward  due to an unknown dark energy component or a new law ?",
    "is gravity ( e.g.  newton s constant ) constant , or strengthening or weakening with time ?",
    "does gravity govern the growth of cosmic structure in exactly the manner it governs cosmic expansion , as in the laws of general relativity , or are there further degrees of freedom ?",
    "does gravity behave the same on all scales ?    at its most basic , we should test our understanding of cosmic gravity because we can , as a reality check .",
    "observations of the deflection of light by gravity ( lensing ) and the growth of matter clustering by gravity are reaching the stage where they can provide incisive information .",
    "moreover , we should justify the long extrapolation of general relativity from the small scales where it is tested to the cosmic scales where it is applied ( more than a factor of billion in length ) , and from high curvature to low curvature regions .",
    "tests of cosmic gravity are further motivated by the fact that the first two precision observational tests have basically shown gaping holes in our understanding : general relativity plus attractive matter fails to predict acceleration in the cosmic expansion , and general relativity plus attractive matter fails to agree with the growth and clustering of large scale structure .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : indep ] we explore methods for testing gravity in phenomenological and model independent approaches . adopting a specific model showing desirable characteristics , galileon gravity , in sec .",
    "[ sec : gal ] we illustrate the theoretical constraints an alternate theory of gravity must satisfy and the handles by which future data will be able to test stringently the nature of gravity .",
    "to test general relativity one can either simply look for consistency with observations or one can measure parameters or quantities that would differ from the general relativity prediction if deviations exist . for an early work addressing some implications of deviations , e.g.   from the inverse square law of attraction , see @xcite .",
    "we will concentrate here on cosmic scales , those above galaxy cluster lengths but well within the horizon , 5500 mpc .",
    "general relativity says that effects on the cosmic expansion are mirrored exactly in the growth of structure , with no extra gravitational degrees of freedom to cause an offset . therefore comparing the expansion history to the growth history",
    "is one of the major tests of the physics .",
    "this implies that it is crucial to fit for the expansion and growth simultaneously , to be alerted to any deviations .",
    "should the gravity theory be assumed ( e.g.  as general relativity ) incorrectly , this will bias the fits of both the expansion and cosmological model .",
    "the converse is true as well ( e.g.  assuming @xmath0cdm ) .",
    "thus , even if one is not interested in gravity one still must fit for it or the quantities one is interested in will be biased .    to separate cleanly the gravity effects on growth from the expansion effects on growth , the gravitational growth index parameter @xmath1",
    "was developed by @xcite .",
    "recall that linear growth of a fractional density perturbation @xmath2 as a function of expansion factor @xmath3 can be well approximated by @xmath4 } } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the present matter density in units of the critical density and the dark energy equation of state @xmath6 to an excellent approximation .",
    "this accurately deconvolves the two influences on the growth , the expansion history in the form of @xmath7 from the gravity law in the form of @xmath1 , providing a fit to better than 0.1% in many of the standard cases .",
    "suppose one considered growth measurements arising from weak gravitational lensing surveys .",
    "the weak lensing signal involves a convolution of the gravitational growth of massive structures at various redshifts along the line of sight and the geometric distance factors serving as a focal length .",
    "if one assumes general relativity ( gr ) , omitting to fit for gravity , then the dark energy parameters one derives from the ( gr ) growth and distances could be strongly biased .",
    "the fit for the time variation of the dark energy equation of state @xmath8 will be incorrect by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the amount by which the true gravity deviates from gr .",
    "that is , failing to fit for gravity also induces failure to fit expansion accurately .",
    "the converse is true as well .",
    "fitting for gravity is therefore necessary .",
    "if we want to go beyond the coarse grained approach of @xmath1 , how should we do so in a practical manner ?",
    "adding parameters without careful thought will merely blow up the uncertainties in both gravity and expansion . as with the gravitational growth index @xmath1",
    ", one must carefully study how to separate cleanly the different physical influences .",
    "one could work within a specific model that determines the gravity and expansion behaviors but such one by one comparisons are time consuming and often give little general insight .",
    "instead we consider various approaches to a more model independent analysis .",
    "general relativity , as summarized by john wheeler , is that `` matter tells spacetime how to curve , and spacetime tells matter how to move '' .",
    "these statements can be thought of mathematically as poisson s equation @xmath11 and newton s first law @xmath12 .",
    "we have suggestively written the spacetime potentials with two different symbols : @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in gr",
    "they are one and the same , but in other theories of gravity they can differ . to tie them closely to the observations we consider two modified poisson equations , @xmath15 the function @xmath16 tests how light responds to gravity , and is central to gravitational lensing and integrated sachs - wolfe measurements .",
    "the function @xmath17 tests how matter responds to gravity , and is central to growth of massive structures and peculiar velocities ; the growth index @xmath1 is closely related .",
    "also see @xcite for a more detailed discussion of these modified poisson equations .    in general @xmath16 and @xmath17 will be functions of time and space , e.g.  redshift @xmath18 and length scale @xmath19 or wavemode @xmath20 .",
    "one approach to parametrizing them with a practical number of degrees of freedom is to be guided by classes of gravity theories .",
    "looking at both higher dimension gravity and scalar - tensor theories one sees a deviation starting from early universe gr behavior and involving either a scale independent or characteristic @xmath21 dependence ( arising from the laplacian in the equations of motion ) .",
    "thus , a useful form is @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 , 2 respectively and a similar form could hold for @xmath16 .",
    "note that leaving out the denominator , so @xmath24 simply deviates from the gr value of 1 as @xmath25 is dangerous as it unfairly weights high vs low redshift observations and can easily lead to bias .",
    "the pad form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pade ] ) is accurate to @xmath261% for dgp and @xmath27 gravity .",
    "for current data , involving weak gravitational lensing , galaxy peculiar velocities , cmb power spectra , supernova distances , and baryon acoustic oscillations , ref .",
    "@xcite simultaneously fits for gravity ( the amplitude @xmath28 and time dependence @xmath29 ) and expansion ( matter density @xmath5 and dark energy equation of state @xmath30 , @xmath8 ) .",
    "they find the gravity constraints are nearly unaffected by the expansion fit , and the expansion constraints are nearly unaffected by the gravity fit . to a significant extent , however , this reflects the status of current data : almost no constraint exists on @xmath29 .",
    "as data improves and becomes more incisive in testing gravity we do expect some degradation in expansion constraints when also fitting , vs fixing , gravity  perhaps a factor of @xmath31 in confidence contour area .",
    "both the above theories of gravity mentioned are simple models with restricted parameters .",
    "dgp @xcite has one gravity parameter , the 5d crossover scale that determines both the amplitude and time dependence of the deviations from gr .",
    "the @xmath27 family of scalar - tensor models has more freedom but can successfully be treated in terms of the scalaron mass @xcite , and this is well fit by an amplitude ( of order @xmath32 ) and a power law time dependence ( i.e.  @xmath29 )  basically two parameters .    indeed ,",
    "if one considers the phase space , or `` paths of gravity '' , of the deviations from gr , dgp shows a definite , near parabolic track in the @xmath33@xmath17 plane and the family of @xmath27 tracks can be calibrated through a rescaling of @xmath29 into a single , also near parabolic track @xcite .",
    "see figure  3 of @xcite for an illustration and further details .",
    "these two classes diverge from each other , and gr , having today @xmath34 .",
    "this suggests , in these cases at least , that we should strive for observations capable of testing this beyond einstein parameter at the 10% level or better .",
    "not every viable theory of gravity may be so simple , however .",
    "it is useful to have another , more model independent approach in our toolkit .",
    "a reasonable choice is to test for the values of the @xmath24 functions in bins of redshift and wavenumber , i.e.  asking whether gravity behaves the same ( and like gr ) at high and low redshift , and for high and low wavenumbers ( small and large scales ) .",
    "while basis functions or principal components are other possible choices , even next generation data will not have the leverage to fit more than 2 modes each with reasonable signal to noise ( not just low noise ) . recall that @xmath35 modes in each of redshift and wavenumber gives rise to @xmath36 parameters ( for @xmath17 and @xmath16 ) , and hence @xmath37 correlation functions , so attempting to fit more than 2 modes is impractical .",
    "we thus consider `` @xmath38 '' gravity : high / low redshift , large / small scales , @xmath17 and @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "such an approach is fully model independent and we can investigate the leverage of current and future observations to test cosmic gravity . in figure  [",
    "fig : gpanels ] we show the results of markov chain monte carlo fits to data and simulations in the two bins each of wavenumber and redshift .",
    "galaxy redshift surveys such as bigboss @xcite will be powerful `` gravity machines '' , capable of mapping the density and velocity fields over a wide range of redshifts .",
    "this is particularly useful at constraining @xmath17 , the function sensitive to growth . gravitational lensing information and the integrated sachs - wolfe effect of the cosmic microwave background",
    "act to constrain @xmath16 .",

    "title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    we see that current data are weak in the ability to test @xmath17 , with uncertainties of order one , while @xmath16 can be determined to roughly 10% from the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey lensing data @xcite and the wmap cmb temperature power spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , note that this precision does not indicate accuracy ; the deviation from gr seen in the bottom right panel , for example , arises from acknowledged observational systematics @xcite .",
    "galaxy redshift surveys such as bigboss will bring @xmath17 also to the 10% precision level . recall that this is just what the `` paths of gravity '' phase space approach above argued was necessary to test gr ,",
    "so we anticipate that next generation observations will reach interesting leverage in understanding cosmic gravity .    for the galaxy surveys one must marginalize over astrophysical effects such as galaxy bias .",
    "here we have taken care of that by allowing the bias to float freely in each 0.1 bin of redshift . due to the complementarity with the other techniques included in stage iii experiments ,",
    "this marginalization causes little degradation ( @xmath41 ) in the final constraints . to reduce the uncertainties on @xmath17 further",
    ", one would need to increase the survey volume or use other growth probes such as cmb lensing . to show the effect of a next generation galaxy weak lensing survey on @xmath16",
    ", we include a rather optimistic survey in the inner red contours , with the result that @xmath16 could be determined in some bins at the 1% level . in any case",
    ", the future of testing gravity looks extremely promising .",
    "exploring beyond the simplest models of gravity is useful to understand what evolutionary signatures the gravitational modifications might exhibit .",
    "this allows us to investigate how robust are the well defined phase space tracks predicted by those particular models , and to look for characteristics that might be smoothed over by the model independent binned approach of the previous section .",
    "moreover , @xmath27 models are arbitrary and unnatural in the same sense that a quintessence potential @xmath42 is : we have no clear physics guidance as to the appropriate functional form and high energy physics corrections will in any case alter it .",
    "two ways to protect against these problems are to avoid completely any potential , using only kinetic terms , and to look for a theory where the degrees of freedom arise geometrically , e.g.   from higher dimensions , protecting against corrections .",
    "galileon gravity incorporates both these solutions .",
    "galileon gravity is based on a shift symmetry in the effective field @xmath43 and involves nonlinear kinetic terms that are allowed ( and only these are allowed ) in order to guarantee second order field equations @xcite .",
    "these also provide a vainshtein screening that restores the theory to general relativity on small scales .",
    "thus , this is a well defined , robust theory that we can explore as a possible extension to gr .",
    "we can write the action for the galileon theory as @xmath44 \\ . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] general relativity arises simply from the `` 1 '' inside the square brackets .",
    "the terms involving @xmath45 through @xmath46 comprise the standard galileon extension @xcite , and one can consider additional couplings to matter given by the @xmath47 term for a linear coupling and @xmath48 for a derivative coupling .",
    "again , these terms guarantee second order field equations .    from the action one can derive the background equations of motion and find under what circumstances",
    "one gets late time acceleration .",
    "note that acceleration occurs despite the absence of any cosmological constant or indeed any scalar field potential .",
    "galileon cosmology has attractor solutions in the radiation and matter eras , avoiding fine tuned sensitivities to initial conditions .",
    "the effective equation of state @xmath49 at early times can be close to that of matter , allowing for a nonnegligible contribution of early dark energy density .",
    "the field generically becomes phantom , @xmath50 , at some epoch near today , and has a future attractor to a de sitter state .",
    "these are all interesting properties for a theory to possess , and are discussed in some detail in @xcite .",
    "perturbing the equations of motion leads to the modified poisson equations for @xmath17 and @xmath16 , and the growth of structure .",
    "we can then study the paths of gravity , the evolution of these @xmath51 functions . in the early universe galileon gravity acts as a thawing field , locked to general relativity at high redshift and then gradually deviating .",
    "the deviation increases linearly as the effective dark energy density does : @xmath52 .",
    "however , unlike the dgp and @xmath27 cases , the evolution is not a simple , quasi - parabolic trajectory from gr to a frozen new value of the gravitational strength .",
    "the interaction between the multiple galileon terms leads to nonmonotonic behavior , strengthening gravity at redshift @xmath53 then restoring to gr before deviating again toward a de sitter attractor .",
    "interestingly , in this asymptotic state the gravitational slip , the difference between the metric potentials @xmath13 and @xmath14 with which we started our exploration of extensions to gr , vanishes ( and hence @xmath54 ) .",
    "but although @xmath55 this is not general relativity , i.e.  the strength of gravity differs from newton s constant , @xmath56 .",
    "galileon cosmology thus shows some fascinating properties and signatures by which we can hope to distinguish it observationally from gr .",
    "figure  [ fig : varyrhoi ] shows the paths of gravity , the evolution of @xmath57 and @xmath58 for the uncoupled galileon for different values of the initial dark energy density .",
    "the larger the initial density , the stronger the deviation from gr at @xmath53 and the closer to the present the bump occurs ; a low initial density is still capable of giving the same late time behavior but with an earlier and milder first deviation from gr .",
    "one might conjecture whether the early enhancement in the gravitational strength could play a role in the development of high redshift structure and early massive galaxy clusters .",
    "detailed comparison of the predictions of galileon cosmology for the expansion and growth history with observational data is in progress @xcite .",
    "however , physical soundness of the theory in terms of lacking pathologies or instabilities already puts important constraints on the galileon parameters @xcite .",
    "the most important conditions are the no - ghost condition , preventing the energy from being unbounded from below , and stability of perturbations , which can be written in terms of the sound speed as @xmath59 .",
    "these requirements not only restrict the viable parameter space but in the linear and derivative coupling cases force those contributions to be subdominant to the standard galileon terms at high redshift .",
    "galileon cosmology has a much richer phenomenology than the simple extensions to gr previously considered and we are still exploring its implications .",
    "it has a sounder theoretical foundation than many other theories ( including most quintessence models ) and the combination of theoretical and observational constraints may soon give rise to definite predictions for how to find deviations from general relativity .",
    "gravitation is a ubiquitous and fundamental force but one that has not yet been rigorously tested , especially over the immense extrapolation to cosmic scales .",
    "the `` direction of gravity '' is an open , active area of research and may hold key insights into cosmic acceleration and the growth of large scale structure .",
    "measuring the expansion history alone , i.e.  the dark energy equation of state @xmath60 , is not sufficient to reveal the physics ; rather , the combination of the expansion history and growth history , or testing gravity as well as the equation of state , is essential .",
    "this introduces the functions @xmath17 and @xmath16 from the modified poisson equations , detailing gravity s direction of matter growth and of light deflection .",
    "failure to fit simultaneously for expansion and gravity runs the risk of substantially biasing both results .",
    "fortunately , simultaneous fitting is straightforward ( with proper definition of parameters to separate the physics ) and does not substantially degrade the constraints .",
    "next generation observations will carry a wealth of information on the cosmic density and velocity fields , and enable model independent gravity constraints on 8 post - gr parameters at the 10% or better level .",
    "for the simplest extensions to general relativity this is within the precision necessary to distinguish the correct theory .",
    "galileon cosmology offers a more robust foundation with respect to physical naturalness .",
    "it also provides a rich phenomenology with attractor solutions in the early and late universe and multiple signatures in both the expansion and gravity behavior .",
    "the parameter space can be constrained through both theoretical considerations and comparison to observations .",
    "although the exploration of the paradoxical topic of the direction of gravity is still in early days , the results so far are exciting  robust , testable alternatives to general relativity .",
    "the next generation of cosmology surveys and theoretical studies should finally test gravity diligently on cosmic scales and address the mystery of cosmic acceleration .",
