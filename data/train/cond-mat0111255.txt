    "insert ( a ) ) .",
    "the observed deviations from such a behavior are probably due to the magnetoelastic coupling since the fe layers are strained to accommodate a common in - plane lattice parameter with the v layers.@xcite",

    "this shows that magnetization wise , the af interlayer coupling has become unresolvably weak for fe layers in the thickness range 9 - 13 ml ; as seen in the insert ( b ) , the saturation field of the af coupled sl drastically decreases when increasing the amount of fe in the superlattice .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the normalized resistivity ( @xmath44 or @xmath45 ) for the fe(3 , 6 and 9 ml)/v(13 ml ) sl , as well as for the fe(13 ml)/v(11 ml ) sample are shown in fig .",

    "the saturation fields derived from the gmr curves agree with the corresponding values derived from the magnetization measurements for the sl with thin fe layers , whereas for the fe(9 ml)/v(13 ml ) , a saturation field is clearly seen in the mr behavior but is not resolvable in the magnetization curves .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath28 for the current fe(3 ml)/v(13 ml ) is lower than a previously reported value@xcite ( 3% compared to 7% ) , which could be attributed to the difference in thickness of the capping layer of pd used , ( 100  compared to 30  in the earlier study ) as will be discussed below .",
    "this changes the amount of current going through the superlattice , which in turn affects the mr ratio .",
    "in addition , changing the thicknesses of the capping layer may also change the coupling strength.@xcite this effect is expected to be of less importance in our case .",

    "we have observed that the resistivity ratio and the magnitude of the measured gmr ratio show a considerable co - variation . a larger resistivity ratio yields a lower gmr value for nominally similar fe / v sl .",
