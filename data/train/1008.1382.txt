    "self - assembly of amphiphilic molecules into mesoscopic ( micelles ) in solution is a common and thoroughly investigated phenomenon @xcite .",
    "dynamic aspects of this process have been extensively studied as well @xcite .",
    "the techniques applied in such experiments and the interpretation of their results have used the framework of reaction kinetics , where each aggregate size is treated as a distinct chemical species , and changes in size and population  as chemical reactions ( ref , chapter 3 ) .",
    "two well - separated time scales are identified in experiments @xcite .",
    "the shorter of the two , denoted @xmath0 ( typically @xmath1@xmath2 s ) , corresponds to the exchange of a single molecule between a micelle and the monomeric solution ; during this time scale the number of micelles remains essentially fixed .",
    "the second time scale , @xmath3 ( which widely varies and may be , e.g. , about @xmath4 s ) is associated with overcoming the barrier to the formation or disintegration of an entire micelle .",
    "the total activation time for such a process is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the number of molecules in a micelle . during this longer time scale",
    "the number of micelles changes .",
    "the first and still prevalent theory of micellar kinetics by aniansson and wall @xcite is based on these observations .",
    "it casts the micellization process in the form of reaction kinetics with two well separated time scales , whereby micelles form and disintegrate through a series of single monomer - exchange reactions . while various extensions to the aniansson - wall theory have been presented over the years @xcite ,",
    "only a few alternative approaches have been suggested . in ref the interesting possibility that micellization may behave as a bistable autocatalytic reaction was explored .",
    "an idealized ( one - dimensional ) nucleation model for linear aggregates was suggested in ref .",
    "an important alternative approach to study micellization kinetics has been the use of computer simulations @xcite . in the case of micellization of amphiphilic block copolymers more",
    "progress has been achieved ( ref , chapter 4 ; refs  ) .",
    "the kinetics of such polymeric micelles , however , usually depends on qualitatively different effects  in particular , the high entropy barrier for polymer penetration into a micelle .    in the current work we present a new approach to the kinetics of surfactant micellization , which is based on a free - energy formalism .",
    "a similar strategy was previously applied to the kinetics of surfactant adsorption at interfaces @xcite .",
    "this approach has two main advantages .",
    "the first is that it provides a more unified description of the kinetics  rather than considering different stages as separate processes ( `` reactions '' ) , they can all be cast as constrained pathways on a single free - energy landscape . considering different processes on the same footing",
    "allows , for example , easier identification of rate - limiting stages such as diffusion - limited or kinetically limited ones @xcite .",
    "the second advantage of such a formalism is that it can be relatively easily extended to more complex situations , such as ionic solutions or surfactant mixtures @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the shortcoming of the model is that it is phenomenological , following coarse - grained thermodynamic variables rather than those characterizing single molecules and aggregates .",
    "it is probably not appropriate for large polymeric micelles , where intra - chain degrees of freedom play an important role and a more detailed description of molecules and aggregates is required @xcite .",
    "we shall focus here , therefore , on the micellization of short - chain surfactants .",
    "another consequence of the coarse - grained modeling is that the derivation for the kinetics of micellization bears similarities to the kinetics of first - order phase transitions  an analogy that was previously invoked @xcite .",
    "however , unlike macroscopic phase separation , micellization is restricted to finite - size aggregates , resulting , for example , in growth laws that are not scale - free .    in the next section we present the free - energy formalism and its implications for the process of micelle formation .",
    "as in previous theories we subsequently separate the kinetics into stages of disparate time scales , during each of which a different set of constraints is imposed .",
    "we discuss separately the kinetics of closed and open systems .",
    "a closed system contains a fixed number of surfactant molecules . in an open system",
    "the surfactant solution is in contact with a large reservoir , which is at thermodynamic equilibrium . whereas in equilibrium",
    "this distinction is usually immaterial , the kinetics of the two cases are found to be strikingly different .",
    "while reading through the various stages of micellization it may be helpful to refer to the two schematic diagrams provided at the end of the article ( [ fig_chart1 ] and [ fig_chart2 ] for closed and open systems , respectively ) .",
    "the first stage that we address is the nucleation of micelles .",
    "subsequently , we describe the growth of the micellar nuclei as they absorb additional monomers from the surrounding solution .",
    "both options of kinetically limited and diffusion - limited growth are studied .",
    "in addition , the possible role of long - distance diffusive transport is examined .",
    "we then consider the final relaxation toward equilibrium .",
    "finally , we summarize the conclusions and discuss the experimental implications of our analysis , as well as its limits of validity .",
    "the model is based on a simple free - energy functional , which has been recently introduced to study metastability issues of micellization @xcite .",
    "apart from the temperature @xmath7 , the free energy depends on three thermodynamic degrees of freedom , which we take to be the total volume fraction of surfactant in the solution , @xmath8 , the volume fraction of surfactant monomers , @xmath9 , and the number of molecules in a micelle ( aggregation number ) , @xmath6 . despite the simplified two - state ( monomer  aggregate ) description , polydispersity can be accounted for as fluctuations of the variable @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "( this , however , restricts the validity of the model to compact micelles whose size distribution is narrow @xcite . ) all energies hereafter are given in units of the thermal energy , @xmath10 .",
    "the free energy has contributions from the entropy of mixing and from the interactions among surfactant molecules .",
    "the former is obtained from a coarse - grained lattice scheme ( flory - huggins model ) , in which a water molecule occupies a single lattice cell of volume @xmath11 , and a surfactant molecule is larger and occupies @xmath12 such cells .",
    "the interactions in the solution are represented by a single phenomenological function , @xmath13 , which is assumed to capture all the molecular contributions to the free energy of transferring a surfactant molecule from the solution into an aggregate of size @xmath6 . the resulting helmholtz free energy density ( per lattice site ) is @xcite @xmath14    + ( 1-\\phi)\\ln(1-\\phi ) , \\label{f}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the volume fraction of micelles , and @xmath16 is the volume fraction of water . at equilibrium",
    "the solution is spatially uniform and characterized by those single mean values of the variables , which minimize the free energy under the appropriate constraints . for a closed system",
    "@xmath17 is minimized with respect to @xmath9 and @xmath6 for a given @xmath8 . for",
    "an open system one should minimize @xmath18 with respect to @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath6 for a given surfactant chemical potential @xmath19 . out of equilibrium the values of variables , such as @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath6 ,",
    "may be position - dependent , and the total free energy is given by spatial integration of the local free - energy density .",
    "( we neglect here surface - tension ( gradient ) terms associated with boundaries between such spatial domains . )",
    "the specific choice of the interaction function @xmath13 is not crucial so long as it has a maximum at a finite @xmath6 to ensure the stability of finite - size micelles . to provide numerical examples , and following previous works @xcite",
    ", we use a simple three - parameter function , @xmath20 the first term in eq [ u ] represents a micelle - size - independent free - energy gain in increasing @xmath6 , the second  a surface energy penalty , and the third is responsible for stabilizing a finite - size aggregate . ( for a more detailed discussion of these terms and the restricted ranges of relevant values for @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , see ref . )    despite its simplicity eq [ f ] defines a rather rich free - energy landscape over a three - dimensional space of macro - states , parametrized by the axes @xmath24 . we are going to treat the kinetics of micellization as time - dependent paths along this landscape , and it is beneficial , therefore , to first recall its key features @xcite , demonstrated in [ fig_landscape ] . for any given @xmath8 and along the @xmath9 axis , @xmath17 always has a single minimum at @xmath25 for all values of @xmath6 .",

    "the system is in the monomeric state , @xmath55 , whereas its equilibrium state is the micellar one . in a closed system",

    "examples are shown in figures [ fig_cnuc]b and [ fig_mmax]b , revealing striking differences from the case of a closed system .",
    "the explanation is straightforward  the system is assumed to be in contact with the reservoir only through its monomeric concentration ( so - called inter - micellar concentration ) , @xmath104 , which hardly changes as @xmath56 is increased above the _",
    "cmc_. hence , during this initial stage @xmath9 remains low regardless of the value of @xmath56 .",
    "consequently , the critical nuclei remain relatively rare and large , almost independent of concentration ( figures [ fig_cnuc]b and [ fig_mmax]b ) .",
    "moreover , since @xmath9 does not reach values above @xmath50 , we get very high nucleation barriers , resulting in an unphysical nucleation time for the open system .",
    "thus , homogeneous nucleation in an open system , which does not have micellar transport from the reservoir , is strongly hindered . in the following discussion of open systems",
    "it is assumed that , despite this strong kinetic limitation , nuclei were somehow caused to form .",
    "the nucleation stage addressed in the preceding section ends when the critical nuclei have formed . on the free - energy landscape",
    "the system has reached the saddle point of @xmath17 .",
    "subsequently , a stage of faster growth takes place .",
    "the free energy of the system decreases while the nuclei absorb additional monomers from the surrounding solution and @xmath6 increases .",
    "the growth is assumed to be much faster than the nucleation of new micelles or fusion and fission of existing ones .",
    "hence , the concentration of micelles , @xmath105 remains fixed at @xmath106 .",
    "consequently , the available volume per aggregate , @xmath68 , remains unchanged as well .",
    "we shall assume that the growth is also faster than the diffusive transport among the micelles ( for closed and open systems ) and with the reservoir ( open system ) .",
    "the increase in @xmath6 , therefore , comes solely at the expense of a decrease in the concentration of the surrounding monomers , while the total surfactant volume fraction is conserved .",
    "thus , we describe the growth kinetics as a constrained path , @xmath107 $ ] , such that @xmath108 and @xmath73 .    although diffusive transport into or out of the subsystem ( of volume @xmath68 ) is assumed negligible during this stage , it is _ a priori _ unclear whether the growth process itself , within @xmath68 , should be kinetically limited or diffusion - limited .",
    "we shall therefore examine both possibilities below .",
    "the constraints and the equations derived in this section apply to closed and open systems alike , yet the values substituted for @xmath8 and @xmath80 differ substantially . while for a closed system @xmath8 is the experimentally controlled surfactant volume fraction , for an open system @xmath8 gets the lower and weakly changing values determined from @xmath56 in the nucleation stage according to eq [ phiopen ] .",
    "the concentration of nuclei is also much lower in the open - system case ( cf .",
    "[ fig_cnuc ] ) .",
    "consequently , the quantitative predictions for the two cases are quite different .",
    "the aforementioned constraints imply that the average monomer volume fraction decreases linearly with the aggregation number , @xmath71 , @xmath109 we are left with one independent variable , @xmath71 , whose change in time could be either kinetically controlled or diffusion - controlled . yet , before studying the detailed evolution , let us examine its final state , which is common to both limits .",

    "at the end of the growth stage monomer transport into the existing micelles has been exhausted , and the micelles have equilibrated with the surrounding monomers . yet , the final state of this stage , @xmath110 , does not correspond to the global free - energy minimum , since up till now we have constrained the concentration of micelles to remain at its nucleation value ( cf .  [ fig_f ] ) .",
    "a slower process should ensue , therefore , during which the size and/or concentration of micelles relax to their equilibrium values .    in the open system",

    "what has not equilibrated yet is the total surfactant volume fraction  specifically , the contribution to @xmath8 from @xmath161 , the micellar volume fraction .",

    "the relaxation of the closed system is qualitatively different . both the monomer volume fraction and aggregation number",
    "have not equilibrated yet and will change in time while keeping the total surfactant volume fraction fixed .",
    "since there is no longer a driving force for directional exchange of monomers with the solution , we expect these changes to occur through fusion or fission of micelles .",
    "such processes occur on the scale of an entire micelle and depend , therefore , on a different microscopic time , denoted @xmath162 .",
    "it is expected to be much larger than the molecular time @xmath61  either because of the long diffusion time required for two micelles to meet before fusing ( in which case @xmath162 should be of order , say , @xmath163@xmath2 s ) , or due to kinetic barriers for fusion or fission .",
    "in addition , @xmath162 should depend on details of inter - micellar interactions .",

    "the range of nucleation times that we get for our exemplary surfactant in a closed system ( typically larger than @xmath72 s ) is in line with measured values of @xmath5  the time scale for formation or disintegration of entire micelles @xcite .",
    "the high nucleation barriers found close to the equilibrium _",
    "cmc _ ( @xmath180 )",
    "imply that the measured ( apparent ) _ cmc _ might in certain cases be higher than the equilibrium value .",
    "this issue , which was raised before in the context of block copolymer micelles @xcite , clearly merits further study .",
    "the growth stage occurs on much faster time scales ( e.g. , @xmath126@xmath163 s for our example ) .",
    "these time scales are similar to those measured for @xmath0  the single - monomer exchange time at equilibrium @xcite .",
    "we have found that the growth may in general be either diffusion - limited or kinetically limited , and that it should be diffusion - limited at concentrations close to the _ cmc_. this is in accord with @xmath0 being usually diffusion - limited for short - chain surfactants while becoming kinetically limited for longer - chain ones , which face higher kinetic barriers for incorporating into a micelle @xcite .",
    "our theory predicts a distinctive @xmath179 power - law relaxation in the case of diffusion - limited growth ( eq [ taudifinfty ] ) .",
    "this prediction should be verifiable in scattering experiments like the one described in ref , when they are applied to short - chain surfactants .",
    "the final relaxation stage in a closed system may involve either reduction in aggregate size ( fission ) , accompanied by an increase in aggregate concentration , or the other way around ( fusion ) .",
    "( see [ fig_mrel ] . ) which of these scenarios holds depends on whether the aggregate size attained in the preceding growth stage has overshot or undershot the equilibrium aggregation number .",
    "the former should hold at concentrations close to the _ cmc _ , whereas the latter occurs at higher concentrations .",
    "we note that in the experiment of ref the aggregates grew in size during their final relaxation , which is in line with the fact that the amphiphilic concentration in that experiment was much higher than its _",
    "cmc_. we note also that the somewhat surprising possibility of an intermediate aggregate size overshooting the equilibrium value was already pointed out in an earlier study @xcite . an interesting consequence of our analysis is that , by tuning to the right surfactant concentration , one should be able to eliminate the final - relaxation stage altogether , thus reaching the equilibrium micellar state already at the end of the fast growth stage .",
    "another relevant prediction is that the relaxation time of this final stage should be almost independent of surfactant concentration ( [ fig_taurel ] ) .",
    "it should be stressed again that these predictions concerning the final relaxation stage require that the preceding growth stage be sufficiently fast so that the two processes could be considered separately . in particular , observing oversized micelles before they shed their extra molecules may be experimentally challenging .",
    "our findings concerning the kinetics of micelle formation have a number of additional experimental implications .",
    "a particularly clearcut one relates to micellization in an open system  a solution in diffusive contact with a reservoir of monomers and micelles .",
    "we have found that , in cases where only monomer exchange with the reservoir is allowed while the transport of micelles is blocked , micellization should be kinetically suppressed .",
    "the suppression is two - fold .",
    "first , strong activation is required for the homogeneous nucleation of the first micelles .",
    "this stems from the low surfactant concentration maintained in the system due to the correspondingly low monomer concentration ( sometimes referred to as the inter - micellar concentration ) in the reservoir .",
    "second , even after micelles do nucleate and grow , the final relaxation of their concentration should be hindered , since it requires the nucleation of additional micelles .",
    "the consequent prediction is that the formation of micelles in such open monomeric solutions may be suppressed for a macroscopic time .",
    "in fact , this behavior is regularly manifest in applications involving micelle - enhanced ultrafiltration @xcite and has been observed in dialysis experiments @xcite , where the time scale of micelle formation was estimated to be @xmath72@xmath181 hours . in both the ultrafiltration techniques and the dialysis experiment a micellar solution",
    "is forced through a membrane , whose pores are smaller than the micelles .",
    "the surfactant solution on the other side of the membrane remains monomeric for a macroscopic time despite its contact with a micellar solution above the _",
    "cmc_. to our best knowledge the analysis presented above provides the first quantitative account of this regularly observed behavior .",
    "apart from the aforementioned strong assumption of time - scale separation , the main shortcoming of our model is its mean - field character .",
    "we have assumed that the kinetics in the surfactant solution can be described within a representative subvolume , @xmath68 , containing a single aggregate and being uncorrelated with the other subvolumes . upon closer inspection ,",
    "in fact , we find that @xmath68 for a closed system typically contains @xmath182@xmath183 surfactant molecules , which is comparable to the aggregation number .",
    "hence , correlations among such subvolumes are to be expected as the micelles nucleate and grow .",
    "another important mean - field aspect is our description of the state of the system as a deterministic point on the free - energy landscape , and its kinetics  as a sharply defined path on that landscape . in practice , and particularly close to the _ cmc _ , the system should be more accurately described by stochastic distributions , with polydispersity and occupancies of both the monomeric and aggregated states @xcite .",
