    "metallic compounds containing rare earth elements with partially filled @xmath0 shells , such as cebe@xmath1 or upt@xmath2 , belong to the general category of heavy fermion materials@xcite .",
    "they are characterized by large pauli susceptibility and specific heat coefficient as compared to ordinary metals , which indicate a huge effective electronic mass ; and also by anomalous transport properties such as non - monotonic temperature dependence of the resistivity .",
    "these anomalies are usually attributed to the formation of a narrow resonant state at the fermi energy due to the admixture of strongly correlated local @xmath0 orbitals with the metallic band of the host .",
    "such materials are normally modelled in terms of an asymmetric periodic anderson model(pam ) .",
    "but many of the high temperature properties of these materials are surprisingly similar to those of a single impurity anderson model(siam)@xcite ; so the formation of this resonance has also been sometimes interpreted in terms of the siam  @xcite .",
    "however , an impurity treatment clearly neglects the effects of correlations between the impurity sites and also of lattice coherence ( i.e. bloch s theorem ) which leads to what nozires  @xcite termed as `` exhaustion '' .",
    "the `` exhaustion '' problem  @xcite , originally posed by nozires in the context of a _ kondo lattice _ , occurs when a _",
    "few _ mobile electrons , @xmath3 , have to coherently screen _ many _ local moments , @xmath4 , in a metallic environment , i.e , @xmath5 .",
    "this situation is engendered by the fact that only the electrons roughly within @xmath6 ( the single impurity kondo temperature ) of the fermi surface can effectively participate in screening the local moments .",
    "thus the number of screening electrons can be estimated as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the _ conduction band _ density of states(dos ) and @xmath9 is the fermi level . a measure of exhaustion is the dimensionless ratio  @xcite @xmath10 nozires has argued that @xmath11 is roughly the number of scattering events between a local moment and a mobile electron necessary for the mobile electron s spin to precess around a local moment by @xmath12@xcite . in the case",
    "@xmath13 , when the number of screening electrons is much smaller than the number of local moments to screen , magnetic screening is necessarily collective and the single impurity picture becomes invalid .    in a recent study@xcite of the pam using the dynamical mean field theory(dmft ) , which is exact in the @xmath14dimensional limit@xcite , it was argued that exhaustion was responsible for the severe reduction of the kondo scale of the pam from that of the impurity problem with the same parameters .",
    "the issue was explored in detail@xcite using the quantum monte carlo  maximum entropy method(qmc - mem ) for solving the self  consistent anderson impurity problem of the dmft .",
    "the reduction of the kondo scale and the crossover between the two scales was interpreted in terms of nozires exhaustion principle  @xcite , and his mapping of the model which has exhausted all available conduction band screening states onto an effective hubbard model . using qualitative and semi - quantitative arguments , nozires",
    "@xcite has suggested that the temperature scale @xmath15 associated with the onset of fermi liquid coherence in this `` exhaustion '' limit is suppressed compared to the kondo temperature of the single - impurity anderson model ( siam ) , @xmath6 , by the factor @xmath11 @xmath16 while the aforementioned suppression of @xmath15 was clearly evident in the qmc simulations , no universal relation of @xmath15 to @xmath6 such as eq .",
    "[ tck ] was found .    in this work ,",
    "we explore the problem of exhaustion in the context of the asymmetric pam once again within the dmft , but using iterated perturbation theory ( ipt )  @xcite for solving the self  consistent impurity problem .",
    "we calculate the spectral functions and as a check on the accuracy of ipt , compare them with earlier qmc - mem results  @xcite .",
    "we find reasonable agreement between the two . the full width at half maximum(fwhm ) of the `` kondo resonance '' in the spectral functions calculated for the pam and the siam provides _ one measure _ of the `` coherence temperature '' @xmath15 and the `` kondo temperature '' @xmath6 respectively .",
    "we find that , consistent with the `` protracted screening '' picture of ref  @xcite and the `` collective kondo screening '' picture of nozires  @xcite , a key feature of exhaustion , namely the suppression of @xmath15 as compared to @xmath6 , is recovered here as well .",
    "furthermore , we find @xmath15 and @xmath6 to be related as @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the fitting parameter and @xmath19 is defined ( similarly to eq  [ noztkp ] ) as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the bare conduction dos and @xmath22 is determined by @xmath23",

    "we first calculate the imaginary part of @xmath67 using convolution integrals on a lorentzian frequency grid ; then use kramers - kronig relations to find its real part .",
    "typically we achieve self  consistency of the green functions within 3 to 4 iterations and the solution for @xmath62 and @xmath48 is found within 10(outer loop ) iterations using a non  linear equation solving routine .",
    "we have performed the calculations described above for various values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 and we present and discuss some representative results .",
    "since ipt is a perturbative technique , we have checked its accuracy by comparing it with the earlier qmc - mem  @xcite results for @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "[ fdos ] shows the @xmath0-spectral function for ipt at zero temperature and qmc - mem at @xmath70 for three conduction band fillings namely @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "both the qmc - mem and ipt results share some common features . for small @xmath73 a single narrow kondo peak",
    "is centered at the fermi energy @xmath74 ; however as @xmath75 , the peak broadens and splits in two , with both peaks shifted from the fermi energy . apparently , the latter is a remnant of the insulating gap found when @xmath76 .",
    "we see that the ipt results match rather well with qmc - mem for @xmath77 , but as @xmath73 is decreased the deviation increases .",
    "the difference in the width of the kondo resonance between ipt and qmc in the low @xmath73 or the exhaustion limit could be due to two factors:@xmath78the calculations for the latter were carried out at higher temperatures which would lead to temperature broadening,@xmath79 ipt is perturbative in @xmath31 while the impurity kondo energy scale , @xmath6 is exponential in @xmath31 .",
    "thus , ipt could become less accurate for very small @xmath73 since the effective @xmath80 is decreasing as @xmath73 decreases(see below ) .    in the qmc - mem work  @xcite , the siam kondo scales and the pam coherence scales were identified from the @xmath81 limit of the inverse of the appropriate impurity spin susceptibility , @xmath82 . since the ipt is not a conserving approximation , it does not provide a unique prescription for calculating @xmath83 . hence , _ as an alternate measure of the kondo and coherence scales _ , we calculate the full width at half maximum(fwhm ) of the kondo resonance in the @xmath0spectral function for the siam and pam and identify these with @xmath6 and @xmath15 respectivelyfor the siam , it is well known  @xcite that both @xmath84 and the fwhm are proportional to the same @xmath6 . ] .",
    "we present our results for these in fig .",

    "as mentioned earlier , we find that @xmath15 and @xmath6 are related according to eq .",

    "we have studied all of them , and hope to discuss them elsewhere .",
    "but the important point is that , given that the pam is being treated using dmft , all the energy scales in the problem are clearly determined by @xmath31 and by the effective hybridization of the self consistent anderson ",
    "impurity problem @xmath87    @xmath88 is shown in fig .",

    "@xmath90 necessarily encapsulates the essential constraints of lattice coherence and collective screening that leads to `` exhaustion '' .",

    "the suppression of @xmath15(and of other scales ) compared to @xmath6 is directly related to the suppression of @xmath88 compared to @xmath93 , as dramatically brought out by the direct comparison of their spectral functions in fig .  [ hartree](b ) .    in fig .",
    "[ hartree](a ) , we also compare @xmath88 with the hartree hybridization @xmath95(@xmath96 where the latter is computed within the hartree approximation ) .",
    "@xmath97 can be interpreted as an effective hybridization that arises when the self  consistent impurity problem is treated within the hartree approximation .",
    "note that it is also strongly suppressed compared to @xmath93 , which can be thought of as being due to exhaustion in the context of `` resonant level screening '' .",
    "however , it is rather flat near the fermi level and misses the strong energy dependence contained in the dip in @xmath90 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ hartree](b ) , the fwhm of the kondo resonance is of course much smaller than that of the hartree spectral function , since the latter has only the resonant  level scales arising from @xmath97 , while the former includes(at least some of the ) non  trivial correlation effects which lead to local moment formation and _ kondo screening _ and the associated narrowing of scales .",
    "this suggests that the strong _ energy dependent _ suppression of @xmath88 is the signature of exhaustion in the context of lattice coherent , collective , kondo screening .    from the arguments we have presented",
    ", one would expect that there should be no such exhaustion effects if @xmath98 .",
    "we have studied such cases as well , and that this is indeed what we find . as we decrease @xmath4 keeping @xmath73 fixed",
    ", we find an increase in the fwhm of the resonance at the femi level , the dip in the effective hybridization near the fermi level gradually disapears , @xmath97 and @xmath88 , although still somewhat suppressed compared to @xmath93 , become almost identical and have a weak energy dependence near the fermi level , indicating that the screening processes in this limit are predominantly `` resonant level screening '' .",
    "we have studied the `` exhaustion '' problem arising from lattice coherent , collective , kondo screening in the context of the asymmetric pam in the limit of infinite dimensions within ipt .",
    "the ipt calculations , despite their limitations , capture ( qualitatively and in some regimes , even quantitatively ) many of the features shown by the qmc calculations  @xcite , including the `` exhaustion '' physics , which manifests itself as a strongly energy dependent suppression of the effective hybridization @xmath99 .",
    "_ as a consequence _ ,",
    "all the ( low ) energy scales of the pam are strongly suppressed compared to the corresponding siam scales .",
    "we have presented detailed results for _ one of them , namely the fwhm of the kondo resonance _ , and find that _",
    "its _ suppression ratio is roughly as proposed by nozires ( except for a @xmath100 dependent scale factor ) .",
    "together , these results also suggest that ipt would be a useful method for incorporating moderate correlation effects into _ ab initio _ calculations of heavy fermion materials  @xcite .",
