    "quite often the research in the field of atomic physics is focused ether on the detailed studies of the structure of a single atomic particle ( atom , ion , molecule ) or on the dynamics of the interaction between such particles during their collision when subtle details in their structure are normally not important . in the present paper",
    "we will consider a process whose proper description necessitates to take into account both subtle details of the internal structure of the atomic system and the interaction of this system with an incident particle . in this process a helium - like highly charged ion ( hci ) is bombarded by a photon or a fast atomic particle ( electron , nucleus or neutral atom ) and , as a result of the interaction between the incident particle and the electrons of the ion , one of these electrons is emitted ( electron loss ) .",
    "we will especially focus on that part of such a process in which the energy of the final state of the subsystem consisting of the residual hydrogen - like ion and the emitted electron , is close to an energy of a doubly excited ( autoionizing ) state of the initial helium - like ion . in this case",
    "the process of electron loss can be strongly influenced by the presence of autoionizing states : indeed , the electron loss can proceed not only directly but also via excitation to autoionizing states with consequent auger decay ( excitation - autoionization ( ea ) channel ) .",
    "the processes of photo and charged particle impact ionization of atoms and ions , in which autoionizing states play a significant role , have been attracting much attention ( see e.g. @xcite for photo ionization , @xcite for charged particle impact , and also references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the experimental and theoretical studies of photoionization of such atoms , like he @xcite , be @xcite , ne @xcite , mg @xcite , ca @xcite , zn @xcite , se @xcite , ar @xcite and xe @xcite , as well as of photodetachment from h@xmath5 @xcite , and of photo electron loss from li@xmath6 @xcite and yb@xmath7 @xcite have shown importance of the ea channel and interference between the ea and the direct ionization ( detachment , electron loss ) .",
    "the role of autoionization in collisions of atoms and ions with electrons has been also under a scrutiny . here ,",
    "the systems considered include , for instance , helium and helium - like lithium ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , various ions : mg@xmath8 , ca@xmath8 , sr@xmath8 @xcite , ga@xmath8 @xcite , ba@xmath8 @xcite , c@xmath9 , n@xmath9 , o@xmath9 @xcite , ti@xmath9 , zr@xmath9 , and hf@xmath9 @xcite , sn@xmath10 ( @xmath11-@xmath12 ) @xcite , xe@xmath10 ( @xmath13-@xmath14,@xmath15 ) @xcite , light lithium - like ions ranging from b@xmath7 to f@xmath16 @xcite , and excited c@xmath8 ions @xcite .",
    "it was , in particular , found that the ea channel and its interference with the direct channel can be of great importance in the processes of electron impact ionization and electron loss .",
    "new features arise in electron loss process when it occurs from highly charged ions where relativistic and qed effects may become of importance .",
    "calculations for electron loss from lithium - like highly charged ar@xmath17 , fe@xmath18 , kr@xmath19 and xe@xmath20 ions by electron impact were performed in @xcite . according to the results reported in @xcite , the breit interaction as well as the m2 transitions",
    "may substantially influence the ea channel and the total electron loss . the cross section for electron loss from beryllium - like hcis in collisions with bare atomic nuclei , differential in the emission angle , was calculated in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite predict a significant impact of the breit interaction on the ea channel involving the @xmath21 state .    a nice review on the various aspects of autoionization in electron - ion collisions can be found in @xcite .    in the present paper we study single electron loss from helium - like hcis by photo absorption and by the impact of fast atomic particles . in this consideration",
    "we will assume that the interactions of the hci with the photon field involves only one photon from this field .",
    "we shall also suppose that the interaction between the atomic particle and the electrons of the hci is sufficiently weak such that it can be described within the first order of relativistic perturbation theory .",
    "thus , both these electron loss processes involve the exchange of just one photon , real or virtual , between the colliding systems .",
    "the main interest of the present study concerns the role of autoionization in the loss processes which can be significant when the energy of the emitted electron is close to the difference between the energy of an autoionizing state of a helium like hci and the energy of the final state of the residual hydrogen - like ion .",
    "in such a case the autoionizing state can participate in the process via the corresponding ea channel .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where both the direct and indirect ( ea ) channels of electron loss are schematically depicted .",
    "two initial states of the hci will be considered : the ground @xmath22 state and the metastable @xmath1 state . in both cases",
    "the residual hydrogen - like ion is supposed to be in the ground state .",
    "note that a transition from the ground state of a helium - like ion to its autoionizing state via a single interaction with an external field becomes possible only due to the interaction ( correlation ) between the electrons of the ion .",
    "therefore , electron loss from the ground state via excitation and decay of autoionizing states represents a highly correlated process .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we consider theoretical treatments for electron loss via photo absorption and by the impact of atomic particles and obtain cross sections for these processes .",
    "results of our numerical calculations and their discussion are presented in section iii .",
    "section iv contains summary .",
    "the relativistic units ( @xmath23 ) are used throughout unless otherwise stated .",
    "our description of electron loss from helium - like hcis by photo absorption and by the impact of fast atomic particles is based on the line - profile approach ( lpa ) @xcite of qed .",
    "the furry picture is used , in which the coulomb interaction of the electrons of the hci with its nucleus is fully taken into account from the onset . the dirac equation is employed to treat both bound electrons and the emitted electron .",
    "the interaction of these electrons with the quantized electromagnetic and electron - positron fields is treated according to the standard qed perturbation theory .",
    "this interaction is taken into account in the zeroth and first orders of the perturbation expansion .",
    "besides , the leading parts of the higher order corrections in the electron - electron interaction are also included into the treatment according to the lpa @xcite .",
    "the interaction between the electrons of the hci with the field of an incident fast atomic particle ( an electron , a nucleus , a neutral atom ) is described within the first order of relativistic perturbation theory .",
    "this implies that the field of this particle has to be relatively weak , which is the case if the conditions @xmath24 or @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is absolute charge of the electron , @xmath27 is the charge of the incident nucleus ( or the atomic number of the incident atom ) and @xmath28 is the collision velocity .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we illustrate our description of electron loss from the ground state by the impact of an atomic particle by presenting feynman graphs which correspond to the zeroth and first orders of the perturbation theory with respect to the interaction between the electrons of the hci . the graph _ a _ represents the main contribution to the direct channel of electron loss in which one of the electrons of the ion , via absorbtion of a virtual photon , makes a transition to the continuum , whereas the other electron remains merely a spectator .",
    "this graph obviously does not contribute to the indirect channel ( ea ) of electron loss , in which both electrons are excited into an autoionizing state with its consequent auger decay .",
    "in contrast , the graphs _",
    "b _ - _ e _ contribute both to the direct and indirect channels .      in the framework of the lpa",
    "the initial and final states of a free hci in the zeroth order of perturbation theory are chosen as configurations of noninteracting electrons in the @xmath29-@xmath29 coupling scheme .",
    "the interaction with the quantized fields leads to various corrections to these states .",
    "they are given as linear combinations of many different configurations of the noninteracting electrons in the @xmath29-@xmath29 scheme .",
    "the coefficients in these linear combinations ( the mixing coefficients ) are obtained in the framework of the lpa .    employing the rest frame of the hci , taking the position of the hci s nucleus as the origin and denoting by @xmath30 and @xmath31 the coordinates of the electrons of the hci , the two - electron wave functions in the zeroth order of perturbation theory",

    "( [ coefa ] ) the @xmath51 is the coulomb phase shift , @xmath52 is the spherical spinor and @xmath53 is the spinor with projection @xmath54 on the electron momentum ( @xmath55 ) @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the pauli vector .",
    "it is convenient to describe the final two - electron state ( @xmath58 ) , which contains the emitted electron , as a linear combination of the following determinants @xmath59 where the quantum numbers @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 refer to the @xmath64-electron in the resudial hydrogen - like hci .    in order to take into account the qed corrections such as the interelectron interaction correction , the electron self - energy , and the vacuum polarization corrections we employ the lpa . according to the lpa we construct new functions which are given by @xcite @xmath65_{nl}\\frac{b_{lm}}{e^{(0)}_{m}-e^{(0)}_{n}}\\psi_n^{(0)}({{{\\bm}r}}_1,{{{\\bm}r}}_2 ) \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 label the two - electron configurations and @xmath70 denotes the set of all two - electron configurations considered in this work .",
    "the set @xmath70 includes all the two - electron configurations composed of @xmath64 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 electrons and the electron in the continuum .",
    "the @xmath80 represents the matrix of the qed corrections : the one- and two - photon exchange corrections , the electron self - energy correction , and the vacuum polarization correction . the first term on the right hand side in eq .",
    "( [ pni_lpa ] ) corresponds to the mixing of the configurations from the set @xmath70 .",
    "the mixing coefficients @xmath81 are obtained within the lpa . the second term on the right hand side in eq .",
    "( [ pni_lpa ] ) takes into account all other configurations which are not included in the set @xmath70 .",
    "the two - electron configuration energy in zeroth order @xmath82 is the sum of the corresponding one - electron dirac energies .",
    "for example , the ground two - electron state constructed according to eq .",
    "( [ pni_lpa ] ) has the following form @xmath83 where only the main terms of the first sum in eq .",
    "( [ pni_lpa ] ) are explicitly given . in order to describe the strongest indirect channels of electron loss from the ground state of a hci ( which are possible via just a single interaction with an external field )",
    "it is necessary to take into account the contributions from the @xmath84 and @xmath85 configurations .",
    "the absolute values of the mixing coefficients corresponding to these configurations are shown in fig.[fig3 ] where they are given as a function of the charge @xmath2 of the hci s nucleus .",
    "it is seen in the figure that the initial rapid decrease in the magnitude of the mixing coefficients at not very large @xmath2 is then replaced by a much slower decrease at higher @xmath2 and that these coefficients become almost constants at very high @xmath2 .",
    "this behaviour can be understood by noting that the coulomb and the breit parts of the electron - electron interaction scale approximately as @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively . since the energy differences , @xmath82 - @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) , scale with @xmath2 as @xmath90 , the contribution of the coulomb and breit parts to the mixing coefficients are proportional to @xmath91 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "therefore , at not very high @xmath2 , where the coulomb part of the electron - electron interaction strongly dominates , we observe that the mixing coefficients depend on @xmath2 as @xmath91 whereas at very high @xmath2 , where the effective strength of breit interaction becomes on overall comparable to that of the coulomb one , these coefficients are almost @xmath2-independent .    within our treatment the transitions between the ground and an autoionizing state via absorption of just one photon ( real or virtual )",
    "is only possible due to the admixture of other configurations to the main configuration in these states .",
    "since the strength of this admixture depends on the absolute values of the mixing coefficients , one can conclude from fig.[fig3 ] that the role of autoionizing states in the electron loss from the ground state rapidly decreases with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , our calculation show that beginning with @xmath3@xmath4 autoionizing states do not noticeably influence even differential spectra of electron loss from the ground state .",
    "let us first consider electron loss from a helium - like hci by absorption of a ( real ) photon . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] both the direct and indirect ( ea ) channels of electron loss are depicted . as was already mentioned ,",
    "the presence of autoionizing states will influence the process of electron loss if the energy of the emitted electron is close to @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the energy of an autoionizing state and @xmath94 is the energy of the ground state of the residual hydrogen - like ion .",
    "the amplitude of electron loss via photo absorption , which includes both the direct and indirect channels , reads @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the photon absorption operator @xcite . in general this operator can be derived within lpa by perturbation expansion . in our case",
    "it sufficient to take @xmath96 in zeroth order form    @xmath97    where @xmath98 are dirac gamma matrices .",
    "four vector @xmath99 is the emitted photon wave function .",
    "we use the transverse gauge in which @xmath100 and @xmath101 reads @xmath102 where @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) are the frequency , momentum and polarization vector of the photon , respectively . employing the multipole expansion we can write @xcite @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 is the spherical bessel function , @xmath110 is vector spherical harmonics , and @xmath105 is vector of photon polarization .",
    "the cross section differential in the emission angles reads @xmath111      similarly to the case of electron loss via photo absorption , it is convenient to give the basic consideration of electron loss by the impact of a fast particle using the rest frame of the hci .",
    "we again take the position of the hci s nucleus as the origin and denote by @xmath30 and @xmath112 the coordinates of the electrons of the hci .",
    "we shall suppose that the energy of the incident particle is so high that its change in the process is negligible compared to its initial value .",
    "this allows us to describe the particle as moving along a straight - line classical trajectory @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the impact parameter , @xmath115 is the velocity of the particle and @xmath116 denotes the time .    within the first order of perturbation theory in the interaction between the electrons of the hci and the field of the incident particle with a charge @xmath117 the amplitude of the electron loss from the hci",
    "is given by @xmath118 @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the interaction between the projectile and _",

    "the fully differential cross section for electron loss by particle impact is given by @xmath131      when an ion collides with a neutral atom , the interaction between the electrons of the ion both with the nucleus of the atom and the electrons of the atom can contribute to electron loss from the ion . according to the consideration of first order in the interaction between",
    "the ion and atom , the role of the atomic electrons in the electron loss is two - fold .",
    "first , in collisions , in which the atom remains in its initial internal state ( elastic atomic mode ) , the electrons of the atom tend to screen ( fully or partially ) the charge of the atomic nucleus ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the screening effect reduces the probability for electrons of the ion to undergo a transition compared to collisions with the corresponding bare atomic nucleus .",
    "second , in collisions , which are inelastic also for the atom , only the interaction with the electrons of the atom may contribute to transitions of the ionic electrons ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the presence of the atomic electrons increases the probability for the electrons of the ion to make a transition @xcite .    in collisions , which are characterized by momentum transfers to the atom substantially exceeding typical orbiting momenta of the atomic electrons , the contributions of the elastic and inelastic atomic modes to the cross sections for excitation of ( electron loss from ) the ion roughly scale as @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively , where @xmath134 is the atomic number of the atom ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the present paper",
    "we consider collisions of hcis with multielectron atoms ( @xmath135 ) only , where the relative contribution of the inelastic mode is small .",
    "therefore , in what follows we shall simply neglect the inelastic atomic mode .",
    "the contribution from the elastic atomic mode can be obtained from expression eq .",
    "( [ s_q ] ) if we replace @xmath117 by the effective charge of the atom given by @xcite @xmath136 where the parameters @xmath137 and @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) are tabulated for various atoms in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present results for electron loss assuming that the incident particles as well as the residual hydrogen - like ion and the emitted electron are unpolarized .",
    "the process of electron loss looks most simple when it is considered in the rest frame of the hci .",
    "therefore , we start with presenting results obtained for this frame .    results of our calculations for electron loss from ca@xmath140(1s@xmath141 ) and zn@xmath142(1s@xmath141 ) by photo absorption are shown in panels a ) and b ) of figs .",
    "[ fig4 ]  [ fig7 ] . in the rest frame of the hci the incident photon",
    "is supposed to move along the @xmath143-axis ( from which the polar angle for the emitted electron is counted ) .",
    "the main feature in the energy spectrum of the emitted electrons , displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig4]a and [ fig5]a , is a number of structures each consisting of groups of narrow maxima and minima .",
    "these structures arise due to the ea channel and its interference with the direct channel of electron loss .",
    "they correspond to the participation of @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 autoionizing states and are embedded in a smooth background which appears solely due to the direct electron loss channel ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "as one expects from the dependence of the mixing coefficients on @xmath2 , these structures are more pronounced in electron loss from the lighter ion where the ea channel plays a more prominent role .",
    "these structures are also seen in the energy - angular distribution of the emitted electrons ( figs .",
    "[ fig4]b and [ fig5]b ) . inspecting this distribution",
    "one can note that with increasing emission energy the maximum in the emission slightly shifts to lower emission angles that is related to the corresponding increase in the momentum of the absorbed photon .",
    "our results for electron loss from ca@xmath140 and zn@xmath142 in collisions with bare nuclei of nitrogen ( n@xmath147 ) are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig4]c , d  [ fig7]c , d for a modest relativistic impact energy of @xmath148 mev / u ( @xmath149 , @xmath150 ) .",
    "we again observe familiar structures in the emission pattern caused by the excitation and auger decay of autoionizing states and interference with the direct electron loss channel .",
    "however , since polarizations and momenta of a real and virtual photon ( both having the same energy ) are quite different , compared to electron loss via photo absorption the emission pattern in collisions with charged particles has a number of distinct features .",
    "in particular , because of less strict selection rules for electron transitions in collisions with charged particles , now more autoionizing states contribute to the loss process .",
    "besides , the angular distribution of the emitted electrons becomes noticeably broader and the maximum in the emission is shifted to smaller emission angles .",
    "moreover , the differences in the shape of the emission pattern in electron loss from ca@xmath140 and zn@xmath142 are much more obvious in collisions with charged particles than in photo absorption .",
    "the change in the shape of the emission spectra , which we observe when @xmath2 varies , is caused by the @xmath2-dependence of the ratio between the typical momentum transfer to the hci in the collision and the typical orbiting electron momenta in the hci .",
    "indeed , the former and the latter scale with @xmath2 approximately as @xmath151 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "the growth of the ratio leads to the increase of the effective number of the partial waves contributing to the state of the emitted electron that changes the shape of the emission pattern .",
    "besides , as calculations show , the effective magnitude of the transverse component @xmath152 of the momentum transfer @xmath127 increases with @xmath2 somewhat less rapidly than its longitudinal component @xmath153 ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "this makes the orientation of @xmath127 effectively @xmath2-dependent . since the relative populations of the magnetic sublevels of the autoionizing and continuum states in the collision depend on the orientation of @xmath127 with respect to the quantization axis",
    ", the relative populations of these sublevels for ca@xmath140 and zn@xmath142 turn out to be different that also leads to changes in the emission pattern .",
    "cross sections for electron loss from ca@xmath140 in collisions with neutral nitrogen @xcite at an impact energy of @xmath148 mev / u are displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig4]e , f and [ fig6]e , f . comparing them with the corresponding results for collisions with equivelocity bare nitrogen nuclei shown in figs .",
    "[ fig4]c , d and [ fig6]c , d we see that the presence of atomic electrons has a rather weak effect on the electron loss process .",
    "the reason for this is that the electrons in the hci are tightly bound and , as a result , the loss process involves momenta transfers which are large on the typical atomic scale of nitrogen that makes the effective charge of the atom @xmath155 , given by eq.([effect_charge ] ) , to be approximately equal to the charge of the unscreened atomic nucleus for the most important range of the momentum transfers contributing to the loss process .",
    "note also that the origin of the weakness of the screening effect in collisions with hci can be viewed from a different perspective .",
    "namely , due to the small size of the ground state of electrons tightly bound in the hci ( and because of not very large impact velocity ) the loss process takes place mainly in collisions with impact parameters much smaller than the size of the atom .",
    "therefore , only a small fraction of the atomic electron cloud can stay between the electrons of the hci and the nucleus of the atom that weakens the screening effect .",
    "since the electrons in zn@xmath142(1s@xmath141 ) are tighter bound than those in ca@xmath140(1s@xmath141 ) , the screening effect of the atomic electrons in the electron loss from zn@xmath142 is even weaker .",
    "therefore , results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig5]c , d and [ fig7]c , d for electron loss by collisions with n@xmath147 essentially represent also results for collisions with neutral nitrogen .    in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] we focus on the range of emission energies for which the @xmath156 autoionizing state actively participates resulting in the strongest resonance @xcite ( for more information about the parameters of the resonance see table 1 ) .",
    "the energy spectra , shown in the left panels of these figures display one of characteristic shapes known as fano profiles @xcite .",
    "such a shape arises because of interference between the direct and indirect ( ea ) channels of electron loss .    for this quite narrow emission energy range both photo absorption and the impact of a fast atomic particle lead to a basically similar shape of the energy spectra although in the latter case the interference is less pronounced because more continuum partial waves contribute to the direct channel of electron loss in collisions with atomic particles than in photo absorption due to larger values of the momentum transfer ( at the same energy transfer ) and also `` softer '' selection rules .",
    "however , the differences between these two processes become much more obvious when the energy - angular distributions of the emitted electron are considered ( see the right panels of figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "note also that the contribution of vacuum polarization and electron self - energy to the position of the resonance is much larger than the total width of the autoionizing state ( see table 1 ) that makes it necessary to take this contribution into account for a precise determination of this position .",
    "comparing results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] we may conclude that , as was already expected , the role of autoionization in the process of electron loss diminishes with increasing the atomic number of the hci . for helium - like hcis with @xmath2",
    "substantially higher than those considered in the previous subsection , the role of these states in electron loss from the ground state becomes negligible .",
    "the situation , however , changes drastically if electron loss from a helium - like hci occurs from the metastable @xmath1 state .",
    "in such a case autoionizing states with the basic configuration involving a @xmath71-electron can be reached from the metastable @xmath1 state by essentially a single - electron transition ( i.e. the electron - electron correlations are no longer necessary for these transitions to occur ) that greatly enhances the role of autoionization in the electron loss process . indeed ,",
    "now a single - electron transition into an autoionizing state can more effectively compete with the direct ( single - electron ) transition into the continuum since the strength of both of them scale with @xmath2 similarly .",
    "therefore , in electron loss from the @xmath1 state , autoionization plays a much more prominent role .    the energy and energy - angular distributions of electrons emitted from helium - like xe@xmath157 and u@xmath158 ions due to photo absorption and in collisions with @xmath148 mev / u nitrogen @xcite",
    "are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] for a rather broad range of emission energies , whereas in figs .",
    "[ fig10 ] and [ fig11 ] we again focus on the narrow range of emission energies for which the @xmath156 autoionizing state takes active part in the loss process .",
    "it is seen that photo absorption and atomic particle impact lead in general to qualitatively different emission patterns .",
    "a comparison of the energy and energy - angular distributions of electrons emitted from ca@xmath159 , xe@xmath157 and u@xmath158 in collisions with n@xmath147 at an impact energy of @xmath148 mev / u is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] for the range of emission energies corresponding to the involvement of the @xmath156 autoionizing state . as it follows from these figures , the autoionizing states play now much more prominent role .",
    "in particular , for electron loss from ca@xmath140 the resonance in the energy spectrum of the emitted electron corresponding to the ea channel is so strong that in collisions with atomic particles its contribution to the total loss cross section is comparable to that of the direct channel .",
    "however , we see that the influence of autoionization still diminishes with increasing @xmath2 . for instance , whereas autoionizing states continue to have a noticeable impact on the total cross section for electron loss from xe@xmath160 , the same already can not be said in case of u@xmath161 . yet , the origin of this decreasing role of autoionization with increasing @xmath2 lies now not in the different @xmath2-scalings for the transitions via the ea and direct channel but is solely caused by the competition between the auger decay of autoionizing states and their spontaneous radiative decay .    for atoms and relatively low charged ions",
    "the auger decay is known to dominate the spontaneous radiative decay .",
    "however , the rate of the latter very rapidly grows with @xmath2 whereas the rate of the former depends on @xmath2 relatively weakly .    for electron loss from ca@xmath140 , for which these two rates are rather close",
    ", the ea channel is still so strong that it not only completely dominates the direct channel in the vicinity of the resonance ( see fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] a , b ) but also gives a very substantial contribution to the total electron loss .    in the case of xe@xmath160 the spontaneous radiative decay of the autoionizing state",
    "is already much faster than its auger decay that makes the ea channel less efficient ( see fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] c , d ) . nevertheless , this channel still greatly dominates the electron loss process in the vicinity of the resonance .    with a further increase in @xmath2 the relative importance of",
    "the ea channel continues to decrease and for electron loss from u@xmath161 the direct channel becomes of equal importance even in the vicinity of the resonance strongly dominating the total emission .    by comparing the results for electron loss from the different ions in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] we observe that the shape of the emission pattern in collisions with atomic particles is very sensitive to the magnitude of @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , comparing electron loss from ca@xmath140 and xe@xmath160 in the vicinity of the resonance corresponding to the transition @xmath162 , where this process in both cases is dominated by the ea channel , we see that the corresponding angular distributions differ qualitatively .",
    "the reasons for this are the same as was already discussed in the first subsection of this section : i ) the momentum transfer @xmath163 to the hci increases with @xmath2 faster than the typical orbiting momenta of the electrons in the hci , and ii ) the longitudinal component @xmath153 of @xmath127 grows with @xmath2 somewhat faster that its transverse part @xmath164 .      up to now we discussed the electron emission spectra by considering them in the rest frame of the hci",
    ". such a theoretical discussion would be directly relevant to a possible experimental exploration of electron loss if the ion rests in the laboratory frame .",
    "the latter can be realized in ebits where hcis are produced by beams of energetic electrons which can also be utilized as projectiles to induce electron loss from ( already prepared ) helium - like highly charged ions . by combining ebit with a source of x - rays ( e.g. with a free - electron laser ) electron loss from helium - like ions by photo absorption",
    "could also be experimentally investigated .    on the other hand , a situation in which electron loss from hcis is caused by fast collisions with atoms or with ( effectively bare ) atomic nuclei",
    "can be experimentally realized in accelerators of heavy ions when the beam of fast hcis penetrates a gas target resting in the laboratory frame .",
    "therefore , in fig . [ fig13 ]",
    "we display results for electron emission from a moving hci which are re - calculated to the laboratory frame .",
    "these electrons are emitted from ca@xmath140(1s@xmath141 ) ions which move in the laboratory frame with an energy of @xmath148 mev / u colliding with a nitrogen target .    in this figure",
    "we focus on very small emission angles ( @xmath165 ) which are relevant to the properties of the electron spectrometer currently functioning at the gsi ( darmstadt , germany ) .",
    "moreover , for these angles we consider only the range of electron emission energies for which autoionizing @xmath166 and @xmath167 states ( which are most visible in the loss process ) as well as the @xmath168 state are involved .",
    "one can conclude from the figure that the signatures of autoionization in electron loss are clearly seen also in the frame where the hci moves .",
    "the relationship between the processes of ionization ( electron loss ) by photo absorption and by the impact of a charged particle is of fundamental importance since its consideration offers a deeper insight into subtle details of the response of atoms , ions and molecules to the action of electromagnetic fields .",
    "as is well known , these two types of ionization ( electron loss ) in general qualitatively differ from each other ( this is very clearly seen , for instance , in figs .",
    "[ fig4][fig11 ] ) .    in our consideration it is assumed that only one photon is involved in the process of photo electron loss and also that electron loss by charged particle impact proceeds via just a single interaction between the colliding particles .",
    "in such a case any difference between these two electron loss processes should be fully attributed to the difference between the properties ( momentum and polarization ) of a real and virtual photon .    in the case of ionization of light atomic systems ,",
    "in which the electron motion is nonrelativistic , the differences between these properties were discussed in detail in @xcite . there , in particular",
    ", it was shown that a virtual photon representing the field of a charged particle becomes almost real if the following conditions are fulfilled @xmath169 it can easily be shown that the same holds true also for electron loss from tightly bound systems , like hcis , where the electron motion is already relativistic .    the correspondence between electron loss by photo absorption and by the impact of a charged particle ( proton , electron ) is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig14 ] and [ fig15 ] where the impact energy of the incident proton ranges from a modest relativistic value of @xmath170 mev ( @xmath149 ) till extreme relativistic energies ( and the corresponding energies of an equivelocity electron except the lowest one which can not be treated in the semiclassical approximation ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] these two processes are compared on the basic level by showing results for the fully differential cross sections . in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] results for the energy - angular distribution of the emitted electrons are displayed .",
    "it is seen that the shapes of the emission pattern in electron loss by photo absorption and by the charged particle impact can be practically identical provided the energy of the incident particle is high enough .",
    "we have theoretically explored electron loss from helium - like highly charged ions via photo absorption and in collisions with atomic particles .",
    "the main focus of our study was on the role of doubly excited ( autoionizing ) states of the ion in these processes .",
    "two initial states of the ion were considered : the ground @xmath22 state and the metastable @xmath1 state .",
    "our description of two - electron states of a free highly charged ion was based on the line - profile approach of qed .",
    "the interaction of the electrons of the ion with the incident photon field ( with the incident atomic particle ) was treated within the first order of perturbation theory .    electron loss in general proceeds via two different pathways which can ( partially ) interfere .",
    "in one of them an electron of the ion undergoes a direct transition from the initial state to the continuum . for highly charged ion",
    "this  direct  channel is essentially a single - electron transition . in the other  the ea channel  the ion",
    "is excited into an autoionizing state which then auger decays .    in electron loss from the ground state",
    "the ea channel must involve in its first step simultaneous transition of both ionic electrons .",
    "this makes this channel highly correlated because both its excitation and decay parts crucially depend on the electron - electron interaction . since the role of the latter decreases with @xmath2 , the ea channel in electron loss from the ground state of highly charged ions in collisions with atomic particles does not have a noticeable impact on the total loss and",
    "can substantially influence only the emission pattern in the vicinity of the corresponding resonances .",
    "moreover , even this influence becomes already quite weak beginning with @xmath171  @xmath4 .",
    "electron loss from the ground state in collisions with photons and atomic particle was explored by considering ca@xmath140 and zn@xmath142 ions .",
    "it was , in particular , found that the shape of the emission pattern in general strongly depends on whether the process is caused by photo absorption or by atomic particle impact .",
    "moreover , in the latter case the shape also very substantially depends on the atomic number of the hci .",
    "autoionizing states with the basic configuration involving a @xmath71-electron can be reached from the metastable @xmath1 state even without taking into account the electron - electron interaction .",
    "therefore , in electron loss from the @xmath1 state , autoionization plays a much more prominent role .",
    "in particular , for relatively light and intermediately heavy helium - like hcis , where the total width of an autoionizing state is not yet strongly dominated by spontaneous radiative decay , the ea channel has not only an enormous impact on the emission spectra in the vicinity of the resonances but also very substantially influences the magnitude of the total loss cross section . however , the ea channel becomes much less efficient for very heavy hcis because in such ions the auger decay is much weaker than the spontaneous radiative decay .",
    "electron loss from the metastable @xmath1 state was studied by performing calculations for ca@xmath140 , xe@xmath160 and u@xmath161 ions .",
    "here it was again found that the shape of the emission spectra in cases of photo absorption and atomic particle impact in general qualitatively differ and that the shape substantially ( or even qualitatively ) changes when the atomic number of the hci is varied .",
    "we also compared electron loss from hcis by photo absorption and due to the impact of an extreme relativistic charged particle .",
    "our calculations confirmed the fundamental similarity of these processes in case when photo absorption is allowed by selection rules .",
