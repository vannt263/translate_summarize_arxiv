    "experiments addressing the nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many - body systems have made remarkable progress in recent years , both probing ultrafast dynamics in strongly correlated materials @xcite and quantum quenches in interacting quantum gases ( see refs .   for a review ) . among the many ultracold quantum - gas experiments with fermions we mention the study of the expansion dynamics of strongly - correlated fermions in a two - dimensional optical lattice @xcite , the collapse and revival dynamics of fermi - bose mixtures @xcite and the real - time decay of a density wave in one - dimensional lattices @xcite .",
    "very recently , several experimental groups reported the successful implementation of fermionic quantum - gas microscopes @xcite , which will give unprecedented access to both equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of the fermi - hubbard model . given the tremendous success of the earlier bosonic quantum - gas microscopes in exploring the nonequilibrium realm @xcite , a considerable experimental activity in studying quantum - quench dynamics in the fermi - hubbard model can be expected in the near future .",
    "quantum - gas microscopes operate with two - dimensional systems which will push the efforts into this most challenging regime ( see also ref .  ) while also allowing to study one - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "a large body of theoretical work has concentrated on one - dimensional systems , the reason being both experiments @xcite as well as the availability of powerful theoretical tools based on field theory @xcite , integrability @xcite or numerical methods . while exact diagonalization ( ed ) is still an indispensable tool ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) , it is limited to small systems .",
    "nonetheless , for problems restricted to the dynamics of a single charge carrier coupled to spin or phonon degrees of freedom , there exist krylov - space approaches that operate in a subspace of the full hilbert space constructed by selecting only those states accessible by the hamiltonian dynamics @xcite .",
    "such an exact diagonalization in a limited functional space has been applied quite extensively to two - dimensional problems as well ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) methods @xcite have been very widely applied to nonequilibrium problems and yield numerically accurate results , but are limited by the accessible times scales and are primarily useful for one - dimensional systems .",
    "a recent variant of the method @xcite has been tailored for long - range interactions and is thus better suited for coupled one - dimensional and two - dimensional systems @xcite but can not overcome the exponential scaling of a matrix - product states ansatz with the number of coupled chains .",
    "the application of time - dependent tensor - network approaches that are based on ansatz states suitable for two - dimensional systems such as the projected entangled pair states has been very little explored @xcite .",
    "apart from time - dependent dmrg methods , there are other many - body methods for the real - time evolution including continuous - time quantum monte carlo @xcite and time - dependent dynamical mean - field theory approaches @xcite .",
    "the former , while being able to achieve essentially exact results for short evolution times , can suffer from a dynamical sign problem @xcite .",
    "the latter method often utilizes continuous - time quantum monte carlo as an impurity solver , while in more recent developments , time - dependent dmrg has also been successfully used for this purpose @xcite .",
    "time - dependent dmft methods are not exact in two dimensions either but are argued to capture better the physics of strongly - correlated systems in higher dimensions , leading to a wide range of applications in the context of nonequilibrium dynamics in the hubbard model ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "finally , the iterative equation - of - motion method for operators provides an alternative approach @xcite , which has also been applied to quantum quench problems in the 2d fermi - hubbard model @xcite .",
    "despite all these efforts , there still is a significant gap between the rapidly progressing experiments in the field of ultracold atoms and accurate quantum dynamics simulations when it comes to correlated systems in two dimensions . to contribute towards closing this gap ,",
    "two of us have applied an alternative approach to the quantum simulation of the nonequilibrium mass - transport of correlated fermions studied in the experiment of ref .",
    ": nonequilibrium green functions ( negf ) .",
    "previously , this theory has been successfully applied to a variety of many - particle systems including the correlated electron gas @xcite , electron - hole plasmas @xcite , nuclear matter @xcite and electrons in quantum dots @xcite , for a recent overview see ref .  .",
    "extensive applications to finite hubbard clusters were presented in ref .   and",
    "first applications of negf to mass transport in small lattice systems of correlated fermions were shown in ref .  . finally , in ref .",
    "these simulations were extended to strong coupling by using @xmath0-matrix selfenergies as well as to substantially larger systems . applying an extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit",
    "the nonequilibrium correlated quantum mass transport in two - dimensional fermion ensembles could be directly compared to the experiments of ref .  , and excellent agreement was observed . for an overview on the negf approach and its application to inhomogeneous hubbard clusters ,",
    "see ref .  .",
    "even though negf simulations are computationally demanding , they have a number of remarkable advantages .",
    "first , they do not exhibit an exponential scaling with system size , as is the case for exact diagonalization , and they do not have a dynamical sign problem as continuous time qmc methods .",
    "second , they are not limited with respect to the system dimensionality , as opposed to matrix - product state methods . at the same time , in contrast to ed , negf simulations are not a first - principle method since they involve a many - body approximation  the selfenergy  which determines the accuracy and the quality of the results , similar to the approximate exchange - correlation energy in density functional theory .",
    "dmrg , on the other hand , also involves an approximation but the numerical errors depend on a control parameter , the discarded weight , and whenever this can be made sufficiently small , the results can become essentially exact for system sizes larger than what is accessible to ed @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of negf simulations of spatially inhomogeneous fermion systems was tested before for few - electron atoms @xcite and small hubbard clusters @xcite where exact diagonalization results are available .",
    "this analysis was extended to larger hubbard systems , on the order of 10 sites in refs .  , revealing a high accuracy of simulations with second - order born selfenergies , for weak coupling and moderate times ( on the order of 20 inverse hopping times ) .",
    "however , the quality of the results for larger systems has remained open until now , due to the lack of reliable benchmark data . on the other hand , for small hubbard clusters ,",
    "also problems were reported : in the case of a strong excitation , two - time negf simulations were found to exhibit an unphysical damping of the dynamics @xcite .",
    "the origin of this behavior has been traced back to the selfconsistent nature of the used approximations .",
    "these deficiencies could be removed to a large extent by making the transition to single - time dynamics with the help of the generalized kadanoff ",
    "baym ansatz @xcite with hartree - fock propagators ( hf - gkba ) @xcite .     in 1d .",
    "the open circles indicate empty sites , the filled circles represent an initial occupation with two fermions , i.e. , a doublon . ]",
    "thus , there is a clear need to further study the question of accuracy and predictive capability of negf simulations , in particular , for systems larger than those studied so far , for longer simulation times and beyond the weak - coupling limit .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present such an analysis by benchmarking negf results using a variety of different selfenergy approximations , in a two - time as well as in a single - time formalism ( i.e. , using the gkba ) , against dmrg results . due to the inherent properties of matrix - product states @xcite",
    ", these comparisons have to focus on 1d fermion systems .",

    "the imbalance starts from @xmath155 and is then expected to decay .",

    "the agreement is excellent for small and moderate couplings .",
    "only once the interaction strength becomes as large as @xmath158 , small deviations are visible which grow for @xmath130 .",
    "this is not surprising because the third - order approximation does not capture higher order corrections .",
    "it contains , however , the third - order electron - hole diagram ( cf .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] ) which becomes essentially important at half filling",
    ". therefore , toa simulations are superior to the @xmath0-matrix calculations with respect to the description of cdw dynamics .",
    "similar trends are seen in the total double occupancy which is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdw](b ) .",
    "the dependence of errors of the negf methods on @xmath111 ( i.e. , an increase as @xmath111 becomes order of the bandwidth ) in this example is the expected generic behavior since these methods are by construction weak - coupling approaches .",
    "dmrg works particularly well for @xmath159 in such problems @xcite , illustrating the complementary strength of negf versus dmrg time evolutions .",
    "in this paper we thoroughly investigated the accuracy and applicability range of negf - based approaches in the description of the complex and correlated electron dynamics in strongly excited large hubbard chains .",
    "the basis for this benchmark analysis were dmrg simulations performed for the same setups . based on this analysis for the selected four setups",
    "we may conclude that negf simulations are reliable and accurate , thereby fully confirming earlier comparisons to exact diagonalization results for small clusters .",
    "thus , negf simulations have predictive power , far beyond the present systems and situations .",
    "more precisely , our conclusions can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the quality of the negf results crucially depends on the choice of the selfenergy , @xmath20 , which is clearly dictated by the physical situation . for weak coupling , @xmath160 (",
    "not studied here , cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the second born approximation is adequate . for moderate coupling , @xmath161 ,",
    "proper approximations are the particle - particle @xmath0-matrix ( tma ) and the third - order approximation ( toa ) , which was investigated here for the first time",
    ". 2 .   for @xmath161 ,",
    "the choice of @xmath20 depends on the local densities ( filling ) : for densities close to zero ( or close to one ) , tma is appropriate , confirming earlier results for small clusters @xcite , whereas near half filling toa is significantly more accurate , as it contains contributions neglected in tma .",
    "3 .   for the present system",
    "sizes the hf - gkba ( with the relevant selfenergy ) yields more accurate results compared to the corresponding two - time simulations ( due to the artificial damping observed in the latter ) . while the envelopes of global dynamical quantities ( energies , cloud size , expansion velocity , density imbalance etc . )",
    "are captured very accurately , oscillations of these quantities are reproduced only qualitatively , for @xmath161 .",
    "4 .   full two - time negf simulations can be used as a support of the hf - gkba data , as typically the exact result is enclosed between the single - time and two - time simulations .",
    "one half of the difference of the two yields a ( conservative ) estimate of the numerical error , at least for couplings @xmath162 .    based on this analysis of the negf capabilities , the main outcome of this paper",
    "is that negf and dmrg have , to a large degree , complementary strengths and limitations , with respect to the interaction strength .",
    "if @xmath7 does not exceed the bandwidth of the system , the negf approach has predictive power even for long - time propagations , and it is directly applicable to 2d and 3d systems  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the exponential spreading of entanglement narrows the dmrg approach to very short 1d simulations ( somewhat larger times can be reached than presented here by using more states and possibly also by using variants of the algorithm @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath7 is larger than the bandwidth , the negf approach , in its present form , does not describe the dynamics properly , due to the built - in perturbative character of the approximations , whereas the dmrg method provides the exact dynamics for rather long times , although being limited to 1d and small 2d systems .      to illustrate this complementarity and the reach of the two methods , we have performed additional long - time simulations and investigated the system size - dependence of the simulations , for the cdw setup ( cf .",
    "[ sec : cdw ] ) . as a particularly sensitive quantity ,",
    "we introduce the average double occupation @xmath163 the time evolution of @xmath164 is shown in fig .",

    "the negf simulations use the hf - gkba with @xmath0-matrix selfenergies .",
    "toa simulations had a stability problem and are included only for shorter times ( see insets ) .    ) , for ( a ) @xmath85 , ( b ) @xmath130 and ( c ) @xmath168 ( dmrg results only ) for chains of length @xmath169 .",
    "full lines : dmrg , short dashes : hf - gkba + tma .",
    "the insets , in addition , show hf - gkba+toa results ( long dashes ) . for better visibility ,",
    "curves for different @xmath8 are shifted vertically by @xmath170 . ]    starting from the case of @xmath85 [ cf .",
    "[ fig : longtime](a ) ] , one can see that the short - time dynamics ( @xmath171 ) of all considered chains are very similar . after the transient oscillations have decayed a quasi - stationary regime",
    "is observed .",
    "however , at some time the double occupation abruptly increases again [ cf .",
    "[ fig : longtime](a ) ] .",
    "these revivals occur periodically , becoming weaker with increasing system size @xmath8 , and their periods increase nearly linearly with @xmath8 .",
    "this indicates particles with a critical velocity that pass through the entire system .",
    "it should be noted that , after the revivals , @xmath164 starts to fluctuate inhomogeneously with an amplitude that decreases with @xmath8 .",
    "we note that similar revivals and system - size dependencies were reported in ref .  .",
    "while for @xmath85 the dmrg simulations are restricted to very short times , e.g. , @xmath172 for @xmath173 ( @xmath174 for @xmath175 ) , the negf simulations easily allow to reach @xmath176 and more , for all chain lengths .",
    "the excellent agreement with dmrg is striking , suggesting that also the long time results are reliable .",
    "consider now the case @xmath130 ,  fig .",
    "[ fig : longtime](b ) . here",
    "the complementary behavior of the two approaches becomes particularly obvious .",
    "while dmrg simulations show an improved performance compared to @xmath85 and reach times of the order of @xmath177 , for @xmath173 ( @xmath178 , for @xmath175 ) , negf simulations still reach times of the order of @xmath176 , however , it is more difficult to achieve convergence .",
    "simulations with the most accurate toa selfenergy are stable only for short times , on the order of @xmath179 , for @xmath142 , similar to dmrg , and are in good agreement with the latter [ cf .",
    "inset of  fig .",
    "[ fig : longtime](b ) ] .",
    "long - time simulations are presently possible only with @xmath0-matrix selfenergies which , however , exhibit a small upshift , compared to dmrg .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath8-dependent revivals that were observed in the negf simulations for @xmath85 are confirmed here as well by the negf results and , even more clearly in the dmrg runs .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : longtime](c ) we show results for @xmath168 . here , accurate long - time evolutions for small systems can be easily performed with the dmrg method . in contrast , the available negf approximations are not accurate enough and show poor convergence for long times ( results from negf simulations not included in the figure ) .      after this analysis of the negf approach and the illustration of the interesting complementarity with dmrg",
    "we briefly discuss questions that will be of interest for future developments .",
    "first , it will be very important to extend the arsenal of selfenergies .",
    "one important improvement will be achieved by extending the @xmath0-matrix approximation by including electron - hole contributions and by including dynamical screening effects ( flex approximation  @xcite ) .",
    "these choices for the selfenergy will help to extend the interaction range where negf properly describes the dynamics . another way to access larger",
    "@xmath7 is to derive novel selfenergies via a perturbation expansion with respect to @xmath180 , i.e. , by starting from a hamiltonian that includes doublons directly .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to further improve the gkba . while it was found to cure the artificial damping problems of two - time simulations ,",
    "the dynamics is often too weakly damped .",
    "this behavior should improve if one uses instead of hf - propagators correlated propagators  @xcite .",
    "while in this paper , 1d and small quasi-1d systems have been investigated for uncorrelated initial states , it will be interesting to extend the present method comparison to more complex , correlated initial states ( including the ground states ) as well as to larger 2d and 3d systems .",
    "it will also be interesting to analyze the dependence of the dynamics on the sign of the interaction  @xcite , to investigate disordered setups  @xcite and to compare the fermionic simulations to those for bosonic lattice systems .",
    "finally , the access of long simulation times by negf and dmrg for weak and strong coupling , respectively should allow one to study interesting features of the quantum - quench dynamics such as prethermalization @xcite ."
