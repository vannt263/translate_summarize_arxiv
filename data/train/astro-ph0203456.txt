    "two of the most important reasons for investigating the ultraluminous iras galaxies ( ulirgs ) are to find the evolutionary connection between circumnuclear massive starbursts and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and to identify the evolution path from galaxy mergers to elliptical galaxies and qsos ( see sanders & mirabel 1996 for a review ) . in recent years",
    ", significant progress has been achieved with both space and ground - based telescopes ( surace et al .",
    "1998 ; surace , sanders , & evans 2000 ; genzel et al .",
    "1998 ; farrah et al . 2001 and reference therein ) .",
    "it is now widely accepted that the vast majority ( @xmath3 ) ulirgs are strongly interacting and merging galaxies while some of them are post - merger galaxies .",
    "the agn phenomenon probably appears at the final merging stage ( e.g. , clements et al .",
    "1996 ; kim , veilleux , & sanders 1998 ; zheng et al . 1999 ; canalizo & stockton 2001a ; cui et al .",
    "spectral analyses for large samples of ulirgs reveal that the fraction of objects with agn spectral characteristics is about 2530% while the fraction of qsos / seyfert 1s is less than 10% ( wu et al .",
    "1998 ; lawrence et al . 1999 )",
    ". however , the percentage of qsos / seyfert 1s increases with increasing infrared luminosity , reaching 3050% for @xmath4",
    "( veilleux , kim , & sanders 1999 ) .",
    "as the infrared luminosity of ulirgs is equivalent to the bolometric luminosity of optically selected qsos ( sanders 2001 ) , we find it convenient to refer to qsos / seyfert 1s selected from ulirgs as ir qsos throughout this paper .",
    "previous spectroscopic studies of small and statistically incomplete ir qso samples have uncovered some unusual properties compared with optically selected qsos / seyfert 1s .",
    "many ir qsos are extremely strong  emitters ( @xmath54570/h@xmath0  @xmath6 ) , for example , phl  1092 , iras  07598 + 6508 and mrk 231 ( lpari 1994 ; lawrence et al .",
    "in fact , almost 100% of extremely strong  emitters are luminous ir qsos ( lpari et al .",
    "more than twenty years after their discovery , the origin of such extremely strong optical  emissions in qsos / seyfert 1s is still being debated .",
    "it has become clear , however , that the strength of the  emission can not be explained in the framework of photoionization excitation .",
    "if strong outflows and shocks are present in strong / extremely strong  emitters , non - radiative shock heating and overabundance of iron may help to explain the strong  emission ( collin & joly 2000 ) .",
    "studies of ir qsos may therefore shed new light on the origin of the  emission .",
    "furthermore , the fraction of low ionization broad absorption line qsos ( lo - bal qsos ) is much higher in an ir qso sample ( 27% ) than that in an optically selected qso sample ( 1.4% ) ( boroson & meyers 1992 ) .",
    "the lo - bal qsos are defined as a subclass of broad absorption line qsos with an obvious @xmath72795,2802  doublet and low - ionization line absorption troughs ( weymann et al .",
    "some ir qsos belong to yet another class of unusual agns , the luminous narrow line seyfert 1s ( hereafter nls1s , osterbrock & pogge 1985 ) .",
    "nls1s are defined by their optical emission line properties .",
    "they have narrow hydrogen balmer lines with typical full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath8 5002000  kms@xmath1 .",
    "the [ ] @xmath25007/h@xmath0  line ratio is less than 3 and most of them have strong  emissions . in the x - ray band , nls1s",
    "show systematically steeper power - law slopes in the continuum than normal seyfert 1s .",
    "some nls1s exhibit rapid x - ray variabilities as well ( boller , brandt & fink 1996 ) .",
    "moran , halpern , & helfand ( 1996 ) pointed out that many nls1s are luminous in the infrared band .",
    "ir qsos therefore offer a unique opportunity to investigate potential physical connections between ir qsos , lo - bal qsos and luminous nls1s ( brandt & gallagher 2000 ; canalizo & stockton 2001b ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ) . in this paper",
    ", we study the spectroscopic properties of ir qsos based on a large sample of 25 objects .",
    "we compare their properties with those of the boroson & green ( 1992 , hereafter bg92 ) sample , which includes 87 optically selected qsos .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in  2 ,",
    "we discuss how our ir qso sample is compiled .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in  3 .",
    "we present the spectra and statistical properties of our sample ir qsos in  4 and finally , in  5 , we discuss and summarize our results . throughout this paper",
    "we use a hubble constant of @xmath9=50  kms@xmath1mpc@xmath1 and @xmath10=1 and no cosmological constant .",
    "as all our objects have redshift lower than 0.35 , the adoption of a different density parameter and cosmological constant has little effects on our results .",
    "our ir qso sample is compiled mainly from three sources    * the qdot redshift survey is a survey of the iras galaxies sparse - sampled at a rate of one in six .",

    "this catalogue consists of 241 objects and 80 of them are identified as qsos / seyfert 1s .",
    "11 of these objects are ir qsos .    due to the constraint of the observatory site and instrumental capability , we selected our targets by requiring the ir qsos to be in the northern sky ( @xmath20 ) and z@xmath210.35 with l(81000  @xmath11m)@xmath1510@xmath16l@xmath17 for h@xmath12=50  kms@xmath1mpc@xmath1 and @xmath10=1 .",

    "note that all the infrared luminosities have been converted using h@xmath12=50  kms@xmath1mpc@xmath1 and @xmath10=1 .    while the sample size is still moderate , it is interesting to put this number in the context of the total expected number of ir qsos in the local universe .",
    "the pscz catalogue provides a complete redshift survey of 15411 iras galaxies ( saunders et al .",
    "about 900 ulirgs were found , which implies the percentage of ulirgs in the iras galaxy catalogue is about 6% .",
    "the percentage of ir qsos among ulirgs is approximately 10% , as there are 8 ir qsos among 97 ulirgs in the qdot catalogue and 10 ir qsos among 108 ulirgs in the 1 jy sample .",
    "so the fraction of ir qsos in the complete pscz catalogue is of the order of 0.6% , i.e. , the total ir qsos in the pscz catalog may be less than 100 .",
    "our sample therefore includes roughly one quarter of ir qsos in the local universe .",
    "statistical results based on this quite large ir qso sample should be representative .",
    "long - slit optical spectroscopic observations were carried out on the 2.16 m telescope at the xinglong station of the national astronomical observatories .",

    "the spectrum coverage was in the range of 3800@xmath236300    with a resolution of 4.9   .",
    "the observation log is given in table  [ tab2 ] listing observation epochs , exposure times , approximate seeings and adopted slit widths .",
    "data reduction was performed using iraf software .",
    "ccd reductions included bias subtraction , flat field correction and cosmic - ray removal .",
    "sky light subtractions were accomplished during the extraction procedure .",
    "wavelength calibrations were carried out using a he - ar lamp .",
    "the resulting wavelength accuracy is better than 1   .",
    "kpno standard stars were observed for flux calibrations .",
    "the telluric o@xmath24 absorption bands near 6870    and 7620    were removed using the spectra of the standard stars .    the iraf package ` splot '",
    "is used to measure isolated emission lines . `",
    "specfit ' , an interactive spectral analysis procedure linked to iraf is used to measure blended lines ( e.g. , h@xmath25and [ ] @xmath76548,6583 ) .",
    "it can match a wide variety of emission lines , absorption lines , and continuum models .",
    "we model the emission lines with gaussian profiles and the local continuum as a power - law .",
    "since the intrinsic extinction of ulirgs is significant , the galactic extinction is ignored in our analysis .",
    "the extinction correction is calculated approximately according to veilleux & osterbrock ( 1987 ) and the intrinsic broad line h@xmath25/h@xmath0  ratio is taken to be 3.1 ( baker 1997 ) .",
    "the h@xmath0/h@xmath26 ratio is used to estimate the extinction when h@xmath25  is out of the spectral coverage ( osterbrock 1989 ) . the measured fluxes of balmer lines are the sum of the narrow and broad components .",
    "it is noted that the intrinsic broad balmer line ratios may be larger than the adopted values ( e.g. macalpine 1985 ) and the extinction corrections may have large uncertainties .",
    "fortunately , the emission line ratios adopted in our analyses , e.g. @xmath54570/h@xmath0  and [ ] @xmath25007/h@xmath0 , are almost independent of extinction , due to the adjacency of the involved lines . for the  residual measurement ,",
    "the uncertainty from the extinction correction will be discussed in section 4.3 . in general , the uncertainty for the flux measurement introduced by the extinction correction is less than 20% .",
    "as the  emission is moderately or extremely strong for most of our sample galaxies ,  multiplets seriously blend with the h@xmath0  and [ ] @xmath74959,5007  lines and contaminate the continuum .",
    "we carefully remove the  multiplets following bg92 .",
    "their method uses an  template derived empirically from high quality data of i zw 1 , a typical nls1 galaxy .",
    "we then measure the flux for all emission lines based on the -subtracted continuum . on the other hand ,",
    "the emission lines for a quite large fraction of our sample ir qsos show a remarkable asymmetric profile . in such cases ,",
    "double - gaussian profiles are needed to fit them .",
    "the asymmetry and blueshift can then be measured from the fitting . in the following subsections",
    "we describe in more detail the  multiplets removal method and the measurement of the line asymmetry and blueshift .      in order to estimate the  strength and",
    "measure the line fluxes reliably , we adopt the bg92 method which relies on an  template . the template and observed spectra",
    "are both transformed into the rest frame .",
    "the template is broadened by convolving with a gaussian of various line widths and scaled by multiplying by a factor indicating the line strength .",
    "the best match is then searched for in the two - dimensional parameter space of the line width and line strength .",
    "a good  subtraction is found when the parts of the continuum between the h@xmath26  and h@xmath0  and between 51005400  (which covers the  multiplets 48,49 ) are flat .",
    "the best - fit  template emission lines are then subtracted from the observed spectrum .",
    "the  flux is then determined from the best fitting template between the rest wavelengths 4434    and 4685   .",

    "moreover , there is no correlation between the fwhm of the narrow gaussian component of the permitted line h@xmath0  and that of the forbidden line [ ] @xmath25007 .",
    "it implies that the narrow gaussian component of the permitted emission lines is different from the narrow lines ( such as [ ] @xmath25007 ) from the narrow line region .",
    "efforts were also made to separate the narrow gaussian component contributed by the narrow line region .",
    "however , the contribution from the narrow line region is usually less than 3% so we ignore this component in our discussions .",
    "we also measure the asymmetry parameter defined by de robertis ( 1985 ) : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the wavelength centers at @xmath31 and @xmath32 of the maximum , respectively , and @xmath33 is the fwhm .",
    "the asymmetry parameter is positive ( negative ) if there is excess light in the blue ( red ) wing .",
    "based on the -subtracted spectra and gaussian fitting of emission lines , we measured the flux , fwhm , and equivalent width ( ew ) for each strong emission line for all our objects .",
    "the fluxes of broad lines or asymmetric lines refer to the sum of double components . for most targets ,",
    "the uncertainty of flux measurement of emission lines is about 10% , but for low s / n cases it could be up to 20% .",

    "however , for three sources ( f02054 + 2835 , f13218 + 0552 and f23411 + 0228 ) , the fluxes of emission lines have large uncertainties due to the poor s / n and hence they are less reliable .    the dereddened and -subtracted spectrum for each sample ir qso is shown in fig .

    "as described in  3.2 , the h@xmath0  blueshift value is determined by the blueshift of the broad gaussian component relative to the narrow gaussian component in permitted emission lines .",
    "the blueshifted broad gaussian component may be connected with the outflow of clouds in the broad line region ( leighly 2001 ) .",
    "outflows with a velocity of several hundred or even a few thousand  kms@xmath1  could produce shocks that can excite the emission lines .",

    "these two objects strengthen the trend described above .    during our data reduction",
    ", we noticed that the  emission can not be subtracted very well by the  template of bg92 for one third of our targets , i.e. , there are large residuals of  multiplets 48,49 ( 51005400   ) or  multiplets 37,38 ( 4500",

    "we define the residual of  multiplets 37,38 ( or 48,49 ) as the excess of 37,38 ( or 48,49 ) relative to its strength in the best - fit template .",
    "a positive residual means that there is an excess in the 37,38 while a negative value signals an 48,49 excess .",
    "the  residual is somewhat uncertain due to the extinction correction .",
    "since the blue light suffers more extinction than the red light , an over - correction in the extinction would lead to an over - estimate of the   multiplets 37,38 and hence increase the value of the  residual in this multiplets .",
    "this overall trend also establishes that the excess of  multiplets 48,49 relative to multiplets 37,38 can not be an artifact .",
    "for example , for f00275@xmath272859 , we have adopted e(b@xmath27v)=0.41 , which results in a negative  residual ( i.e. , there is an excess in the  multiplets 48,49 ) .",
    "if no extinction is adopted , then the value of the  residual in the multiplets 48,49 would further increase by 30% .",
    "we note that while boroson & green ( 1992 ) have described such residuals , they are not as remarkable as in our ir qso sample .",

    "all these parameters are correlated .",

    "[ figresiduals ] , although somewhat weak , may be a useful clue for understanding why some strong / extremely strong  emitters are x - ray luminous while others are x - ray quiet .",
    "one of the striking features of the emission lines for ir qsos is the blueshift of permitted emission lines or the forbidden [ ] @xmath25007  line .",
    "as we have removed the  multiplets carefully surrounding the h@xmath0and [ ] @xmath74959,5007 , there should not be much  multiplet contamination to the h@xmath0  and [ ] @xmath74959,5007  emission lines .",
    "moreover , the blueshifts measured from h@xmath0  and h@xmath25  are similar , as are the blueshifts measured from the [ ] @xmath25007  and [ ] @xmath24959  lines ( see fig .",
    "the asymmetries of the h@xmath0  and [ ] @xmath25007  lines can not be attributed to contaminations from other emission lines .",
    "outflows give a plausible explanation for the emission line blueshift ( for alternative explanations , see brandt et al .",
    "such emission - line outflows have been found and discussed extensively for some nls1s ( leighly 2000 ; christopoulou et al .",
    "1997 ) , radio galaxies ( tadhunter et al . 2001 ) and for ir qsos ( lpari 2002 ) .    from the strong correlation between the fwhm and the h@xmath0  fwhm , boroson & green ( 1992 ) suggested that the  line and permitted emission lines share a common emission region . if the h@xmath0  blueshifts are due to cloud outflows in the broad line region , shocks are likely to be produced in outflows",
    ". such shocks may be responsible for the  emission , as the pure photoionization model fails to explain the strong  emission ( collin & joly 2000 ) .",
    "the tight correlation between the h@xmath0  blueshift and the @xmath54570/h@xmath0  ratio can then be understood as they are physically connected through shocks associated with outflows .",
    "analogously , the [ ] @xmath25007  blueshifts could probe the outflows in narrow line emission region .",
    "it is interesting to see that all objects with large [ ] @xmath25007  blueshifts are located close to the blackbody line in the infrared color - color diagram .",
    "hence the locations of ir qsos in the infrared color - color diagram may be related with outflows in the [ ] @xmath25007  emission line region .",
    "we caution , however , that there are other explanations concerning the strong  emission , especially in nls1 galaxies ( see sulentic , marziani , & dultzin - hacyan 2000 for a review ) .",
    "if the emission line blueshifts can indeed be attributed to outflows , then our sample indicates such outflows are common for ir qsos .",
    "our statistics do not however clarify which mechanism ( central agn radiative pressure , starbursts or both ) drives these outflows .",

    "for the remaining objects , most are moderate strong / extremely strong  emitters . however , 71% ( 5/7 ) of the extremely strong emitters in ir qso sample fail to meet the strict criterion of nls1s .",

    "our results seem to support the above statement and hint that the strength of optical  emission line , rather than the h@xmath0  fwhm , may be the most important characteristic of non - classical qsos .",
    "much attention has been paid to lo - bal qsos recently .",

    "they are intermediately located between the power - law and blackbody lines in the infrared color - color diagram ( cf .",
    "[ figcolor ] ) .",
    "a recent chandra survey for bal qsos also revealed that all these four lo - bal qsos have high column densities and are unusually faint in both soft and hard x - ray bands ( gallagher et al .",

    "if uv observations establish that they are real lo - bal qsos , the percentage of lo - bal qsos in our sample will be 20% , similar to the fraction found by boroson & meyers ( 1992 ) for a much smaller ir qso sample .",
    "brandt & gallagher ( 2000 ) argued that the potential physical connection between luminous nls1s and lo - bal qsos is their high accretion rate relative to the eddington accretion rate .",
    "ir qsos tend to appear in the final merging phase with their central agn activity recently triggered or rejuvenated by the merging activity ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ; zheng et al .",
    "1999 ; canalizo & stockton 2001a and reference therein ) .",
    "numerical simulations show that a large amount of gas flows toward the center during mergers ( e.g. , barnes & hernquist 1991 ) , so it seems plausible that ir qsos also have high accretion rates .",
    "such systems may have a greater ability to drive radiative outflows .",
    "the correlations we presented in section 4.2 suggest that the outflow velocity and the physical condition in the outflow region ( inferred from the h@xmath0  and [ ] @xmath25007  emission line blueshifts ) influence the , infrared and soft x - ray emission properties . in short , ir qsos ,",
