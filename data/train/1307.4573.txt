    "a group action is one of the most important tool in the study of mathematical objects .",
    "finite group actions in symplectic geometry appear in various contexts , such as mirror symmetry , singularity theory , etc . in this paper",
    ", we will construct finite group actions on lagrangian floer theory .",
    "lagrangian floer homology ( developed by floer@xcite , oh@xcite , fukaya - oh - ohta - ono @xcite ) has been a powerful tool , which revolutionized the study of symplectic topology .",
    "furthermore , its categorical versions , fukaya category ( fukaya @xcite ) and fukaya - seidel category ( seidel @xcite , @xcite ) , are the main players of homological mirror symmetry as envisioned by kontsevich @xcite .",
    "when a symplectic manifold as well as a lagrangian submanifold admits a finite group action , it is indeed quite natural to expect that such an action exists on lagrangian floer theory .",
    "but there are several technical difficulties to define such an action as we will explain below . in the case of @xmath3-actions on exact symplectic manifolds",
    ", seidel has defined @xmath3-equivariant fukaya categories @xcite .",
    "another known case is when a group acts freely on the set of connected components of a given exact lagrangian submanifold in an exact symplectic manifold .",
    "in such a case , it is relatively easy to define a group action , since one can use pull - back data ( such as spin structure , perturbation data , etc ) to make floer theory compatible with the given group action .",
    "such construction was proposed by seidel @xcite in his study of mirror symmetry of quartic surfaces in an exact setting .",
    "let us now describe our main results .",
    "we will first explain the exact case , and later the case of general closed symplectic manifolds .",
    "for an exact symplectic manifold @xmath4 , consider a @xmath2-invariant exact lagrangian submanifold @xmath5 , which means that a @xmath2-action preserves the lagrangian submanifold .",
    "suppose that @xmath5 is spin and that its spin structure is @xmath2-invariant .",
    "we show that the @xmath2-action on @xmath5 gives rise to a group cohomology class in @xmath6 ,  the spin profile of @xmath5 \" , which is the obstruction to extending the group action to the spin bundle of @xmath5 .",
    "the main observation is that if two lagrangian submanifolds have the same spin profile , then it is possible to define a group action on the lagrangian floer cohomology of the pair in the exact case .",
    "thus for each cohomology class @xmath7 , an @xmath1-equivariant brane is defined as a @xmath2-invariant exact lagrangian submanifold whose associated spin profile is @xmath1 , with a @xmath2-invariant grading .",
    "let @xmath4 be an exact symplectic manifold . for @xmath8 , an _",
    "@xmath1-equivariant fukaya category _ can be defined as follows .",
    "an object of @xmath1-equivariant fukaya category is given by an @xmath1-equivariant brane .",
    "morphism between two @xmath1-equivariant branes @xmath9 are given by @xmath10 , which has a @xmath2-action .",
    "there are @xmath11-operations @xmath12 which are compatible with the @xmath2-action .",
    "i.e. for @xmath13 @xmath14    to be more precise , we should equip each @xmath1-equivariant brane with a @xmath2-equivariant flat complex vector bundle as in section [ sec : orbibundle ] .",
    "the @xmath1-orbifolded fukaya category is defined to have the same set of objects as the @xmath1-equivariant fukaya category , but we take @xmath2-invariant parts of morphisms of the @xmath1-equivariant category . then , the @xmath1-orbifolded fukaya category naturally inherits an @xmath11-structure from the @xmath1-equivariant category from .    as an application",
    ", we define both equivariant and orbifolded fukaya - seidel categories of a @xmath2-invariant lefschetz fibration .",
    "namely , for each @xmath7 , we define _",
    "@xmath1-equivariant fukaya - seidel category of @xmath15 _ ( see definition [ def : fs ] , [ def : fs2 ] ) . by taking @xmath2-invariant parts on morphisms , and the induced @xmath11-structure",
    ", we obtain the _",
    "@xmath1-orbifolded fukaya - seidel _ category of @xmath16 .",
    "let us turn our discussion to the case of a general closed symplectic manifold ( which is not exact ) with an effective action of a finite group @xmath2 .",
    "consider a lagrangian submanifold @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , which has an induced @xmath2-action .",
    "suppose that @xmath17 has a @xmath2-invariant spin structure , with a spin profile @xmath19 for @xmath18 .",
    "fix a base path @xmath20 \\to m$ ] such that @xmath21 for @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath22 be the energy zero subgroup @xmath23 of @xmath24 as in definition [ def : galpha ] .    if @xmath25 , then the lagrangian floer filtered cochain complex of @xmath26 admits a @xmath22-action",
    ". more generally , filtered @xmath11-bimodule of the pair @xmath27 admits a natural @xmath22-action .",
    "suppose that @xmath28 is connected and let @xmath29 .",
    "then @xmath30 , and we have a @xmath2-equivariant filtered @xmath11-bimodule quasi - isomorphism @xmath31    the method developed in this paper , together with the work of fukaya in @xcite should define equivariant fukaya categories in the general case .    more detailed introduction and description are now in order .      in this paper , we introduce the notion of a _ spin profile _ of a lagrangian submanifold with a @xmath2-action .",
    "such a notion is deeply related to the orientation of the moduli space of @xmath32-holomorphic discs and the @xmath2-action on it .",
    "recall that if a lagrangian submanifold is spin , a choice of spin structure determines canonical orientations of the moduli spaces of @xmath32-holomorphic discs ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hence , we need to analyze the relation between the group action on @xmath5 and that of its spin structure .",
    "we assume that the related spin structure is @xmath2-invariant , which means that for a principal spin bundle @xmath33 , the pull - back bundle @xmath34 via the action of @xmath35 is isomorphic to the original bundle @xmath36 .",
    "in fact , the precise isomorphism between @xmath34 and @xmath36 ( as in @xmath2-equivariant sheaves ) , which can be considered as a lift of the @xmath37-action to the one on spin bundle , will be necessary to determine the sign of the @xmath37-action on the floer complex .",
    "in general , these isomorphisms are not necessarily compatible with each other , and the @xmath2-action on @xmath5 does _ not _ lift to the one on the spin bundle .",
    "hence , one can not expect that any orientation preserving action of a symplectic manifold gives rise to an action on its fukaya category .",
    "a _ spin profile _ is defined as the group cohomology class in @xmath6 which measures the obstruction to extending the action of @xmath2 on a manifold to the one on its spin structure .",
    "we show that if spin profiles of two lagrangian submanifolds coincide , then we are able to define a group action on lagrangian floer theory of a pair ( we need to develop @xmath2-novikov theory additionally for non - exact symplectic manifolds ) .",
    "the main point is that the exact signs from failures of group actions on spin bundles cancel out for lagrangians with the same spin profiles .",
    "this means that the equivariant fukaya category is defined for each choice of spin profiles in @xmath6 .",
    "construction of the @xmath3-equivariant fukaya category by seidel @xcite , in fact , corresponds to the non - trivial class in @xmath38 .",
    "we explain several properties of spin profiles , and also the change of spin profiles under the change of spin structures .",
    "let @xmath4 be an exact symplectic manifold with an effective action of a finite group @xmath2 .",
    "we fix a class @xmath8 , and consider @xmath1-equivariant branes as explained above .",
    "it may happen that some of @xmath37-action send @xmath5 to @xmath39 which is disjoint from @xmath5 , in which case we can take @xmath40 to be the new @xmath2-invariant lagrangian submanifold .",
    "we do not assume that @xmath5 is connected in the exact case .",
    "in general , the equivariant fukaya category of @xmath41 should also have @xmath2-equivariant lagrangian immersions to @xmath41 . in the sequel of this paper @xcite",
    ", we will investigate extensively such @xmath2-equivariant lagrangian immersions , and explore the relationship of @xmath42-equivariant immersions into @xmath43 with chen - ruan orbifold cohomology of @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "in fact , one should consider a more general notion of orbifold embeddings @xcite , but they were shown to be equivalent to @xmath2-equivariant immersions for global quotients in @xcite , and hence it is enough to study the latter .",
    "there is another technical issue , which are equivariant transversalities of the related moduli spaces of holomorphic discs .",
    "namely , we would like to choose perturbation data equivariantly , so that we have strict @xmath2-equivariant @xmath11-operations . in the exact case ,",
    "we follow seidel @xcite to achieve it with aid of an algebraic machinery . in the general case later , kuranishi structure ( as in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) will be used , which is in fact a device to achieve this kind of equivariant transversality    we construct a version of donaldson - fukaya categories ( @xmath45 in definition [ donald ] ) , and produce a @xmath2-action on it from the weak @xmath2-action on the related floer complex ( see @xcite for the weak @xmath2-actions on morse complexes ) .",
    "then , the homological perturbation type lemma of seidel ( lemma 4.3 of @xcite ) enables us to define the @xmath1-equivariant fukaya category for an exact symplectic manifold . by taking @xmath2-invariant parts on morphism spaces ,",
    "the @xmath1-orbifolded fukaya category of @xmath44 $ ] is obtained .",
    "this should be regarded as a first approximation of orbifold theory , as we should also add bulk deformation by twisted sectors as in @xcite .    as an application",
    ", we define _ the directed equivariant ( and the orbifolded ) fukaya - seidel category _ of a @xmath2-invariant lefschetz fibration @xmath46 , where @xmath41 is equipped with a @xmath2-action , and @xmath47 is @xmath2-invariant . in mirror symmetry , orbifolds and orbifolded landau - ginzburg models",
    "appear naturally , and have been actively investigated .",
    "our work provides the necessary framework to state homological mirror symmetry in these cases by defining appropriate orbifold fukaya categories .",
    "we only deal with @xmath2-invariant lefschetz fibrations in this paper and leave the case of an orbifolded @xmath48-model which is not lefschetz fibration and of a @xmath2-equivariant @xmath48-model to the future investigation .      for a closed symplectic manifold which is not exact ,",
    "the lagrangian floer cohomology is the morse - novikov homology on path spaces between two lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "hence , we need to develop @xmath2-novikov theory .",
    "we first recall @xmath2-morse theory from our previous work @xcite . given a morse - smale function @xmath49 on a compact manifold @xmath41",
    ", one can define the morse - smale - witten complex ( morse complex for short ) by counting gradient flow lines between critical points of @xmath50 .",
    "if @xmath50 is @xmath2-invariant , we studied how to define a finite group action on the morse complex , whose homology of the @xmath2-invariant part is isomorphic to the singular homology of the quotient orbifold .",
    "one of the main observation of @xcite is that one should consider not only the action on critical points , but also on the orientation spaces ( defined from their unstable manifolds ) .",
    "now , morse - novikov theory ( novikov theory for short ) generalizes morse theory to the case of a general closed morse one form @xmath51 , instead of @xmath52 .",
    "novikov theory is a kind of morse theory associated to a morse function on a certain novikov covering ( so that the pull - back of the given closed one form becomes exact ) , together with the action of the group ring of its deck transformation group .    in this paper , we define finite group actions on novikov theory .",
    "the main difficulty is that the base point chosen for novikov theory is _ not _ preserved by the group action .",
    "we resolve this issue by introducing the subgroup @xmath53 of energy zero elements of @xmath2 , where @xmath35 is said to be energy zero if there is an energy zero path ( with respect to the action functional ) from the base point to its @xmath37-action image .",
    "and we will construct an action of energy zero subgroup on the novikov complex using this energy zero path .",
    "together with an appropriate orbifold novikov ring coefficient , taking @xmath53-invariant part defines @xmath2-novikov theory      by using spin profiles and @xmath2-novikov theory , we can define group actions on lagrangian floer cohomology groups for non - exact cases as follows .",
    "let @xmath4 be a closed symplectic manifold with an effective @xmath2-action .",
    "fix @xmath8 and consider a lagrangian submanifold @xmath17 ( for @xmath18 ) whose spin profile is @xmath1 . for a base path @xmath24 between @xmath28 and @xmath54 , take an energy zero surface @xmath55 connecting @xmath24 and @xmath56 for @xmath37 in the energy zero subgroup @xmath23 ( definition [ def : galpha ] ) as an analogue of @xmath2-novikov theory .",
    "we assume that @xmath57 for simplicity . for each generator of the floer complex of a pair @xmath27",
    ", one can consider its orientation space , which is the determinant bundle of the associated cauchy - riemann operator .",
    "this construction already appeared in @xcite , and seidel also used orientation spaces in exact cases .",
    "then , the actual group action is defined to be an action on orientation spaces , where the action image is obtained by gluing the determinant bundles of @xmath55 ( more precisely , @xmath58 ) to the naive @xmath37-action image of a generator of the floer complex ( see definition [ def : aact ] ) . here",
    "the lagrangian bundle data along the boundary @xmath59 will be given a specific spin structure , and @xmath60 is defined to be 0 ( resp .",
    "1 ) if such spin structure is trivial ( resp .",
    "non - trivial ) .",
    "then , the following identity from proposition [ prop : compadm ] @xmath61 guarantees the cocycle condition of the group action , provided that the spin profiles of @xmath28 and @xmath54 agree with each other .    in this way , we get a well - defined action of @xmath2 on the floer cochain complex @xmath62 between @xmath28 and @xmath54 . with equivariant kuranishi perturbations , we show that the floer differential as well as the @xmath11-bimodule structure on @xmath62 is compatible with the @xmath2-action .",
    "therefore , the bimodule structure descends to the @xmath2-invariant part of @xmath62 , which should be interpreted as a morphism space between @xmath63 $ ] and @xmath64 $ ] in the fukaya category of the orbifold @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "invariance of the floer cohomologies under @xmath2-invariant hamiltonians can be proven as well .",
    "that is , if @xmath54 is the hamiltonian deformation of @xmath28 by a @xmath2-invariant hamiltonian function on @xmath41 , then the assumption @xmath65 always holds and moreover , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are @xmath2-equivariantly isomorphic as @xmath66-modules .",
    "for the purpose of mirror symmetry , we need to consider complex flat line bundles on lagrangian submanifolds . with @xmath2-action , @xmath2-equivariant structures of such bundles should be also taken into account .",
    "the constructions in this paper can be adapted to the cases with @xmath2-equivariant line bundles by following the standard constructions .",
    "such a @xmath2-equivariant bundle may be considered as an orbi - bundle on the orbi - lagrangian @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "hence an object of an orbifolded category @xmath69 is given by a @xmath2-invariant lagrangian ( or a @xmath2-equivariant immersion ) equipped with a @xmath2-equivariant line bundle on it . here",
    "morphisms of @xmath70 are obtained by taking the @xmath2-invariant part of morphisms in the @xmath2-equivariant category .",
    "recall that @xmath71-branes of mirror symmetry are given by derived categories of coherent sheaves .",
    "when there is a group action , it is natural to work with @xmath2-equivariant sheaves .",
    "the standard naming convention for equivariant sheaves are unfortunately different from ours .",
    "namely , what we call an orbifolded category ( taking @xmath2-invariant parts on morphisms of an equivariant category ) , is called an equivariant category for the case of sheaves .",
    "we will see later that if @xmath72 is given by a lagrangian torus fiber bundle equipped with an action of @xmath2 compatible with bundle structure , then its dual torus bundle @xmath73 naturally admits a @xmath2-action .",
    "in general , if @xmath73 is given as a syz ( strominger - yau - zaslow ) mirror of @xmath72 , we conjecture that the ( derived ) orbifold category @xmath74 is equivalent the derived category of @xmath2-equivariant sheaves on @xmath73 .",
    "when the mirror of @xmath72 is a landau - ginzburg model @xmath75 , it turns out that @xmath76 is invariant under the @xmath2-action on @xmath73 .",
    "we conjecture that homological mirror symmetry is the equivalence between the @xmath2-equivariant matrix factorization category of @xmath76 and orbifolded fukaya category @xmath69 .",
    "( see section [ mirrorsymm ] for the precise statements including spin profile data )    character group of @xmath2 acts on both sides of mirror by twisting the equivariant structures on bundles .",
    "namely , given an orbifold bundle ( or @xmath2-equivariant bundle ) for @xmath77 , one can change @xmath2-equivariant structure by multiplying a character .",
    "we expect that these actions are compatible with homological mirror symmetry .",
    "we will look into toric cases , and present more conjectures and examples .",
    "let us also mention that in a forthcoming work with siu - cheong lau , we will analyze mirror symmetry phenomena for @xmath2-equivariant immersions into finite group quotients , and construct a _ localized homological mirror functor _ for immersed lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "+      we will assume throughout the paper that @xmath2 is a finite group . and",
    "@xmath2-action are always assumed to be effective , proper , and orientation preserving , unless stated otherwise . a submanifold @xmath78 preserved by the @xmath2-action of @xmath41",
    "is called @xmath2-invariant .",
    "here , the action of @xmath35 sends @xmath5 to @xmath5 , but it may not fix @xmath5 pointwisely .",
    "in fact , if @xmath5 is a lagrangian submanifold of @xmath41 and @xmath37 fixes every point of @xmath5 , then it is easy to see that @xmath37 fixes a neighborhood of @xmath5 in @xmath41 .",
    "since the action on @xmath41 is assumed to be effective , such @xmath37 should be the identity element of @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath79 be a field containing @xmath80 , and we will use @xmath81 or @xmath82 for floer theory .",
    "we use the following @xmath79-normalization convention due to seidel ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section ( 12e ) ) .",
    "this is because , roughly speaking , we are only interested in the signs , rather than magnitudes in orientations spaces . for any @xmath83-dimensional real vector space @xmath84 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath85 the @xmath83-dimensional @xmath79-vector space generated by the two orientations of @xmath84 , with the relation that the sum of two generators is zero .",
