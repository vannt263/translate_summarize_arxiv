    "the 2-flavour schwinger model is a 2d theory of two fermion species and photons . in the massless continuum model the @xmath1 flavour symmetry is broken by a mechanism mimicking spontaneous symmetry breaking . due to the mermin - wagner - coleman theorem @xcite in this situation",

    "independent of the possible spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry ( which does not occur in 2d but is expected in e.g. qcd@xmath3 ) we expect that the chiral symmetry of the action itself is restored at a critical fermion coupling @xmath4 . however , since the wilson term breaks chiral symmetry explicitly we have no known simple order parameter , which allows one to identify that position . following earlier proposals",
    "@xcite it has recently been suggested to utilize pcac - relations with schrdinger functional methods for that purpose @xcite ; this turned out to be quite powerful in the context of qcd@xmath3 @xcite . here",

    "the fermions were simulated with the hmc - method ; more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "global symmetries of an action on the classical level lead to conserved noether - currents . in a qft the symmetries may be spontaneously broken or broken due to anomalies resulting from the functional integration .",
    "so the relations expressing current conservation may change depending on the mechanism of symmetry violation . to derive these relations",

    "such a behaviour in the context of the schrdinger functional is used to determine the value of improvement coefficients . in our case",
