    "the nuclear @xmath5-scaling analysis of inclusive electron scattering from a large variety of nuclei ( e.g. @xcite ) showed the existence of high - momentum components in the nucleon momentum distributions @xmath6 at momenta @xmath7 @xmath8 due to the presence of nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) correlations .",
    "it was shown ( see , e.g. @xcite ) that this specific feature of @xmath6 , which is similar for all nuclei , is a physical reason for the scaling and superscaling phenomena in nuclei .",
    "the concepts of scaling @xcite and superscaling @xcite have been explored in @xcite for extensive analyses of the @xmath9 world data ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "scaling of the first kind ( no dependence on the momentum transfer ) is reasonably good as expected , at excitation energies below the quasielastic ( qe ) peak , whereas scaling of second kind ( no dependence on the mass number ) is excellent in the same region .",
    "when both types of scaling behavior occur one says that superscaling takes place . at energies above the qe peak both",
    "scaling of the first and , to a lesser extent , of the second kind are shown to be violated because of important contributions introduced by effects beyond the impulse approximation , namely , inelastic scattering @xcite together with correlation contributions and meson exchange currents @xcite .",
    "the superscaling analyses of inclusive electron scattering from nuclei for relatively high energies ( several hundred mev to a few gev ) have recently been extended to include not only quasielastic processes , but also the region where @xmath10-excitation dominates @xcite .",
    "a good representation of the electromagnetic response in both quasielastic and @xmath10 regions has been obtained using the scaling ideas , importantly , with an asymmetric qe scaling function @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the scaling variable in the qe region ) and a scaling function @xmath13 in the region up to inelasticities where the @xmath10 contribution reaches its maximum .",
    "both functions were deduced from phenomenological fits to electron scattering data .",
    "particularly , for the scaling function in the quasielastic region it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that , in contrast to the relativistic fermi gas model scaling function , which is symmetric , limited strictly to the region @xmath14 , and with a maximum value 3/4 , the empirically determined @xmath11 has a somewhat asymmetric shape with a tail that extends towards positive values of @xmath12 and its maximum is only about 0.6 .",
    "of course , the specific features of the scaling function should be accounted for by reliable microscopic calculations that take fsi into account . in particular , the asymmetric shape of @xmath15 tested in refs .",
    "@xcite by using a relativistic mean field ( rmf ) for the final states shows a very good agreement with the behavior presented by the experimental scaling function .    the superscaling analyses and the present knowledge of inclusive electron scattering allowed one to start studies of neutrino scattering off nuclei on the same basis .",
    "the reactions of incident neutrino beams interacting with a complex nucleus have offered unique opportunities for exploring fundamental questions in different domains in physics . recently , positive signals of neutrino oscillations confirmed the hypothesis of non - zero neutrino masses and triggered much interest on this issue @xcite . to better analyze the next generation of high - precision neutrino oscillation experiments and to reduce their systematic uncertainty both neutral- (",
    "e.g. @xcite ) and charged - current ( e.g. @xcite ) neutrino - nucleus scattering have stimulated detailed investigations .",
    "the neutrino - nucleus interactions have been studied within several approaches investigating a variety of effects . using the superscaling analysis of few - gev inclusive electron - scattering data ,",
    "a method was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to predict the inclusive @xmath16 and @xmath17 cross sections for the case of @xmath1c in the nuclear resonance region , thereby effectively including delta isobar degrees of freedom .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the important final - state interaction effects arising from the use of relativistic optical potentials within a relativistic green s function approach lower the cross section by at least a 14% factor at incoming neutrino energies of 1 gev .",
    "a similar result has been obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite where the use of random phase approximation ( rpa ) to predict the neutrino - nucleus cross section was discussed .",
    "apart from relativistic dynamics and fsi , other effects may influence the neutrino - nucleus reactions .",
    "the role of pauli blocking and fsi in charged - current neutrino induced reactions is analyzed in refs .",

    "@xcite to calculate the scaling function in finite nuclei firstly within the coherent density fluctuation model ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . this approach , which is a natural extension of the rfg model , has shown how both basic quantities , density and momentum distributions , are responsible for the scaling and superscaling phenomena in various nuclei .",
    "although the scaling function obtained in @xcite is symmetrical around @xmath18 , the results agree with the available experimental data at different transferred momenta and energies below the quasielastic peak position , showing superscaling for @xmath19 including @xmath20 , whereas in the rfg model @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the qe scaling function can be obtained within the cdfm in two equivalent ways , on the basis of the local density distribution , as well as of the nucleon momentum distribution . as pointed out in @xcite , the nucleon momentum distributions @xmath6 for various nuclei obtained in @xcite within a parameter - free theoretical approach based on the light - front dynamics method ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein )",
    "can also be used to describe both @xmath5- and @xmath12-scaling data .",
    "so , in our present work we explore both methods , cdfm and lfd , to investigate further the scaling functions and their applications to analyses of electron- and neutrino scattering off nuclei .",
    "our work is motivated by the fact that different models of the nuclear dynamics ( including those with rmf dynamics and with rpa - type correlations accounted for ) describe with different success the basic size and shape of the cross sections in studies of high - energy inclusive lepton scattering used so far .",
    "for this reason we extend further our consideration and calculate within the cdfm and lfd the scaling functions in the kinematical regions of the qe and @xmath10 peak on the basis of momentum and density distributions of finite nuclear systems in which nucleon correlations are included .",
    "this can be done either by using available empirical data for these quantities or theoretical calculations in which correlations are included to some extent .",
    "then , the obtained scaling functions are applied to calculate electron - nucleus cross sections in qe and @xmath10 regions in the energy range from 500 mev to 2 gev for the target nucleus @xmath1c and to predict charge - changing neutrino and antineutrino reaction cross sections from the scaling region to the qe peak at energies of few gev .",

    "as already mentioned in the introduction , the superscaling behavior was firstly considered within the framework of the rfg model @xcite where a properly defined function of the @xmath12-variable was introduced . as pointed out in @xcite ,",
    "however , the actual nuclear dynamical content of the superscaling is more complex than that provided by the rfg model .",
    "it was observed that the experimental data have a superscaling behavior in the low-@xmath24 side ( @xmath24 being the transfer energy ) of the quasielastic peak for large negative values of @xmath12 ( up to @xmath25 ) , while the predictions of the rfg model are @xmath21 for @xmath26 .",
    "this imposes the consideration of the superscaling in realistic finite systems .",
    "one of the approaches to do this was developed @xcite in the cdfm @xcite which is related to the @xmath27-function limit of the generator coordinate method @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the superscaling in nuclei can be explained quantitatively on the basis of the similar behavior of the high - momentum components of the nucleon momentum distribution in light , medium and heavy nuclei .",
    "as already mentioned , the latter is related to the effects of the nn correlations in nuclei ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the scaling function in the cdfm was obtained starting from that in the rfg model @xcite in two equivalent ways , on the basis of the local density distribution @xmath28 and of the nucleon momentum distribution @xmath6 .",
    "this allows one to study simultaneously the role of the nn correlations included in @xmath28 and @xmath6 in the case of the superscaling phenomenon . to explore these properties",
    "the scaling function @xmath2 has been derived in two ways in cdfm in @xcite .",
    "firstly , by means of the density distribution @xmath28 , it leads to @xmath29 with a weight function of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 @xmath32 with @xmath33 is the scaling function related to the rfg model @xmath34 \\left\\ { 1 + \\left ( \\frac{rm_n}{\\alpha}\\right)^2 \\left ( \\frac{k_fr|\\psi'|}{\\alpha } \\right)^2 \\right . \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times \\displaystyle \\left .",

    "@xcite we extended the cdfm description of the quasielastic @xmath12-scaling function from @xcite by expressing it explicitly and equivalently by means of both density and nucleon momentum distributions . in @xcite our results on @xmath11 were obtained on the basis of the experimental data on the charge densities for a wide range of nuclei . in the present work we extended our approach to consider the scaling function @xmath11 for medium and heavy nuclei with @xmath3 for which the proton and neutron densities are not similar . in this case",
    "@xmath11 is a sum of the proton and neutron scaling functions calculated by means of the proton and neutron densities obtained from nonrelativistic self - consistent mean - field calculations .",
    "this concerns calculations , as examples , of nuclei like @xmath59au , @xmath64kr , as well as @xmath90ni and @xmath91sn @xcite . the comparison with the data from @xcite shows superscaling for negative values of the qe @xmath12 including @xmath20 , whereas in the rfg model @xmath21 for @xmath26 ( see fig .  [ fig01 ] ) .",
    "\\ii ) we introduce the asymmetry in the cdfm qe scaling function using the fact that the maximum value of @xmath2 in rfg model is 3/4 while the empirical scaling function reaches values smaller than 0.6 . in relation with this and the normalization , we parametrize the rfg scaling function for @xmath101 , thus simulating the role of all the effects which lead to asymmetry and imposing this to the cdfm qe scaling function . in this way , simulating phenomenologically the effects which violate the symmetry of @xmath11 for @xmath101 including the role of the fsi , one can obtain in the cdfm a reasonable agreement of @xmath11 with the empirical data also for positive values of @xmath12 ( fig .  [ fig02 ] ) .",
    "\\iii ) we obtain the qe scaling function also on the basis of calculations of nucleon momentum distribution @xmath6 within an approach based on the light - front dynamics method @xcite which improves that used in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we include in the particle - state part of @xmath6 not only a contribution of the function @xmath331 ( as in @xcite and @xcite ) but also a contribution of the function @xmath332 . @xmath331 and @xmath332 are two of the six scalar components of the deuteron total wave function in the lfd @xcite and are the main contributions to the tail of @xmath333 .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] the reasonable agreement of @xmath6 in lfd with the @xmath171-scaling data @xcite .",
    "this result made it possible to obtain a good description of the experimental qe scaling function ( fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] ) at least up to @xmath334 .",
    "\\iv ) we extend our analysis within the cdfm and lfd to the @xmath10-peak region which is the main contribution to the inelastic scattering . here",
    "we emphasize that reasonable agreement with the experimental data ( fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] ) was obtained using the empirical value of the coefficient in front of the rfg scaling function ( 0.54 instead of 0.75 ) in both cdfm and lfd . also , the parameter @xmath335 used in the fermi - type density for @xmath1c ( necessary to calculate the weight function @xmath336 and thus the scaling function @xmath337 ) has a smaller value ( 1.565 fm ) than that ( @xmath199=2.42 fm ) in the qe case , while the value of the diffuseness parameter @xmath338 remains the same as @xmath63 in the qe case .",
    "we note that the use of @xmath174 with the same values of @xmath211 and of @xmath45 ( @xmath161 , @xmath214 @xmath8 ) gives a reasonable agreement with results for both qe- and @xmath10-region scaling functions ( figs .",
    "[ fig04 ] and [ fig05 ] ) .",
    "\\v ) the qe- and @xmath10-region scaling functions obtained in the cdfm and in the lfd approach are applied to description of experimental data on differential cross sections of inclusive electron scattering by @xmath1c at large energies and transferred momenta ( figs .  [ fig06]-[fig15 ] ) .",
    "the cdfm results are presented for both almost symmetric ( @xmath270 ) and asymmetric ( @xmath263 ) scaling functions .",
    "we observe that there are two regions of the value of @xmath268 in different experiments at which the above mentioned ( almost symmetric and asymmetric ) scaling functions work better .",
    "the almost symmetric scaling function leads to results in agreement with the data in the region of the qe peak in cases when the transferred momentum @xmath339 in the position of maximum of the qe peak @xmath340 is in the scaling region ( @xmath341 mev / c @xmath342 ) , while the data are overestimated in cases where @xmath269 mev / c .",
    "the results obtained when asymmetric scaling function ( @xmath263 ) is used agree with the data in cases when @xmath343 mev / c and underestimate them when @xmath265 mev / c in the region close to the qe peak , but differences emerge in the transition region . in our opinion , the latter case is preferable because additional effects ( apart from qe and @xmath10-resonance ) , e.g. of the meson exchange currents could give additional important contributions to the inclusive electron cross sections for some specific kinematics and minor for others .",

    "our results are compared with those from the rfg model and from the erfg model @xcite .",
    "the results obtained by using the asymmetric cdfm scaling function are close to those of erfg and are quite different from the rfg results while the almost symmetric cdfm scaling function leads to cross sections which are similar to the results of the rfg model .",
