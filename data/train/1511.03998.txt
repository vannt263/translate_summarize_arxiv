    "emergence of multipartite entanglement @xcite as a crucial ingredient in several information processing tasks like measurement - based quantum computation @xcite , quantum dense coding @xcite , and quantum cryptography @xcite has emphasized the importance of quantifying entanglement in multipartite systems .",
    "multipartite entanglement has been proven essential also in detecting cooperative phenomena such as quantum phase transitions @xcite , and to explain transport properties in photosynthetic complexes @xcite ( see @xcite for reviews ) . in this respect",
    ", it has also been pointed out that multipartite entanglement can be necessary to detect some cooperative phenomena , which are not clearly signaled by bipartite measures @xcite .",
    "the growing interest for estimating multipartite entanglement in many - body systems is also sustained by impressive experimental advances towards creating entangled particles in laboratories in various substrates , _",
    "e.g. _ , trapped ions @xcite , photons @xcite , superconducting materials @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonances @xcite , and optical lattices @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . however ,",
    "despite considerable attempts , progress in developing measures of multipartite entanglement has been limited @xcite .",
    "an interesting utility of multipartite quantum states is the measurement based quantum computation @xcite , where quantum gates are implemented by solely performing suitable measurements on different local parts of a previously prepared quantum state of a number of parties , eg .",
    ", on a lattice . in a different situation , one may consider performing measurements on some parts of a multiparty quantum state , so that the remaining parties share a useful quantum state .",
    "a particularly important example is provided by the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xcite , given by @xmath0 .",
    "tracing out @xmath1 qubits from @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , leads to a separable state with vanishing entanglement , while performing local measurements over the @xmath1 parties , one obtains an ensemble of pure states conditioned to the measurement outcomes , which has non - zero entanglement .",
    "such protocols encourages one to consider a general scenario where an @xmath4-party quantum state , @xmath5 , is measured at a certain number of parties , to obtain an ensemble of a lower number of parties , where no measurement was carried out , with the measurements being so chosen that the average entanglement , according to a predecided measure , of the pre - measurement ensemble is minimized .",
    "such entanglement accumulation scheme have been previously used to define entanglement measures @xcite , where it was usual to choose the number of unmeasured parties as two . here",
    "we go beyond the regime , where the the number of parties in the post - measurement ensemble is more than two .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a localizable multipartite entanglement ( lme ) measure , in terms of the geometric measures of entanglement @xcite , and discuss its various properties . specifically , we prove that the localizable multipartite entanglement measure is invariant under local unitary transformations , and show that it is bounded above by any upper bound of its parent multiparty entanglement .",
    "note that the concept of lme requires the knowledge of another multiparty entanglement measure , and due to the compact computational form of multiparty entanglement , as quantified by the generalized geometric measure ( ggm ) @xcite , we restrict ourselves to the cases in which the ggm is identified with the latter measure .",
    "we call the corresponding quantity as the localizable ggm ( lggm ) . for arbitrary number of qubits",
    ", we analytically find the exact expression of lggm for several classes of multipartite states which include the generalized ghz ( gghz ) state @xcite , generalized w ( gw ) state @xcite , and dicke states with different excitations @xcite , when measurement is restricted to a single qubit .",
    "interestingly , we find that in the case of gghz state , lggm coincides with the ggm of the original state . on the other hand , for gw state , local measurement helps to accumulate higher multipartite entanglement in the lower number of qubits , as compared to the content of multipartite entanglement of the original state , showing qualitatively distinct behavior than the gghz state .",
    "moreover , we prove that the value of lggm over two qubits in the case of an arbitrary three - qubit pure state is always lower bounded by the value of the geometric measure of the original state , while no such bound exists when higher number of qubits are involved .    for specific classes of four- and five - qubit states ,",
    "we show that local measurement on two parties may help to increase lggm , as compared to the same with only single - qubit measurement .",
    "extensive numerical simulations seems to imply that such observation holds for almost all four- and five - qubit states . such investigations lead to a natural question whether lggm is more useful than the other multipartite entanglement measures of the original state . for detecting the quantum phase transition ( qpt ) @xcite of the quantum ising model in a transverse field @xcite",
    ", we observe that the system approaches to the quantum critical point much faster when lggm is used as the observable compared to its counterpart of the original state .",
    "we use finite - size calculations to analyze the relative speed of the approach to the critical point .",
    "besides , we find that lggm faithfully signals the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition of the xxz model @xcite .",

    "the lme of a multiparty pure state can be defined as the maximum average multipartite entanglement that can be concentrated over a certain specified set of parties in the system by performing local measurements over the rest of the parties .",
    "let us consider a pure state @xmath6 , which describes a multipartite system consisting of @xmath4 parties distinguished by the index @xmath7 . for simplicity , while defining the lme , we consider that the dimension of hilbert space of each of the parties is same , i.e. , @xmath8 . however , a more generalized definition using different dimensions for different parties can also be given .",
    "let us consider local quantum measurements performed by any @xmath1 parties on the @xmath4-party state , @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 be the set of positions of the measured qubits , given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 .",
    "the local measurements lead to a post - measurement outcome ensemble , @xmath13 , of pure states .",
    "the index @xmath14 denotes the running index of the measurement outcomes , and runs over the joint hilbert space of the measured parties having dimension @xmath15 . here , @xmath16 is the probability of obtaining the state @xmath17 , with @xmath18 being the corresponding measurement operator , and @xmath19 .",
    "the lme for the multipartite state @xmath9 , for local measurements at @xmath20 , can be defined as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a complete set of measurement operators on the @xmath15-dimensional hilbert space , and @xmath23 is an arbitrary multipartite entanglement measure for the state @xmath2 . here ,",
    "@xmath24 @xmath25 , and is currently redundant in the notation .",
    "its use will become clear once we reach eq .",
    "( [ glob_lggm ] ) .",
    "we will also assume that @xmath26 , although the formalism adopted here can be generalized to the case of @xmath27 also .",
    "the state @xmath28 corresponding to the @xmath4-party state @xmath29 , for a fixed @xmath10 and a fixed measurement outcome @xmath14 , is obtained by tracing out the @xmath1 parties in which local measurements are performed .",
    "the supremum is taken over all complete sets of measurement operators , @xmath30 .",
    "it is important to note here that the conceptualization of an lme depends on the understanding of another measure of multiparty entanglement of a lower number of parties .",
    "this latter measure is in some sense acting as a `` seed measure '' for the lme . to define lme",
    ", one may consider measurement protocols corresponding to either projective measurements ( pv ) without classical communication between the parties , or positive operator valued measures ( povms ) without classical communication between the parties , or general local operations and classical communication ( locc ) . in the last case , the classical communication ( cc ) is among the @xmath1 parties over which the local operations are performed .",
    "it is clear that @xmath31 for a fixed multipartite state , @xmath6 , a fixed set of measured parties , @xmath10 , and a chosen multiparty entanglement measure , @xmath32 .",
    "one must note here that for a fixed initial multipartite state @xmath9 , the value of lme depends on two factors : * ( i ) * the multipartite entanglement measure @xmath32 ( the seed measure ) , and * ( ii ) * the set @xmath10 , i.e. , the choice of @xmath1 parties over which local measurements are performed . before discussing the choice of @xmath32 , let us briefly consider the dependence of lme over the set @xmath10 that is inherent in the definition .",
    "for an @xmath4-partite system with local measurements at @xmath1 parties , a set @xmath33 , @xmath34 , of all possible choices of @xmath10 exists , thereby allowing @xmath35 number of values of lme , @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , the lme , @xmath37 , is `` local '' in the sense that it changes with the choice of the set @xmath38 . in light of this fact",
    ", one can also define a `` global '' value of the lme for a multipartite state with fixed values of @xmath4 and @xmath1 as @xmath39 note that if the initial state @xmath9 is a symmetric state , such maximization over @xmath40 is not required .",
    "note also that the relative positions of the parties labeled by `` @xmath41 '' , for a specific @xmath42 , with respect to each other as well as the rest of the parties does not affect the value of lme . from now on , without any loss of generality , we assume that the measurements are performed at @xmath43 , @xmath44 , while @xmath28 denotes the state of the remaining @xmath45 parties",
    ".    we can extend this definition to an arbitrary mixed state when the input state is an @xmath4-party state @xmath46 , and the measurement is performed on any @xmath1 parties .",
    "the problem in this case remains with the choice of @xmath32 , which is possible to compute for a given multiparty state .",
    "such multiparty quantum correlation measures are rare .",
    "although the notion of entanglement measures in multipartite systems is an active field of research , the number of such computable measures is still limited . in principle",
    ", an lme can be defined for any one of the known candidates for multipartite entanglement measure being used as the seed measure , such as relative entropy of entanglement @xcite , global entanglement @xcite , and other multipartite measures @xcite . however , in the present study , we focus on geometric measures ( gm ) of entanglement @xcite .    the geometric measure of entanglement of an @xmath4-partite state @xmath47 , is defined as @xmath48 where @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) is an integer denoting the number of product state partitions into which the @xmath4-partite state @xmath51 can be divided @xcite .",
    "the distance of the state @xmath47 is minimized over the set , @xmath52 , of all @xmath49-separable pure states , @xmath51 , and we refer to this measure as `` @xmath49-separability based gm '' ( k - gm ) . for example , @xmath53 corresponds to a fully separable state @xmath54 , leading to the original definition of gm @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "ggm is obtained for @xmath55 @xcite , the other extremum of k - gm , which we denote by @xmath56 .",
    "the optimization in the definition of @xmath56 can be performed by using the maximization of the schmidt coefficients across all possible bipartitions of @xmath47 , leading to the simplified version of ggm @xcite , given by @xmath57 here , @xmath58 is the maximum schmidt coefficient of @xmath47 , the maximum being taken over the set , @xmath59 , of all arbitrary @xmath60 bipartitions such that @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , the null set .",
    "the above expression allows one to compute ggm of a multiparty pure state in arbitrary dimensions and for arbitrary number of parties .",

    "this implies that the state @xmath82 is allowed to be @xmath83-separable , where @xmath84 .",
    "moreover , irrespective of whether the partitions @xmath78 and @xmath79 share entanglement amongst each other , the possible separability of the partition @xmath78 consisting of @xmath1 parties dictates that the original state , @xmath9 , is allowed to be @xmath85-separable , where @xmath86 .",

    "the ground state of the model experiences a kt transition @xcite at @xmath258 , which is signaled by a blunt minimum in the @xmath176 vs. @xmath249 curve ( see fig . [",

    "on the other hand , the lggms , namely @xmath244 and @xmath245 , show a sharp cusp at @xmath258 , correctly signaling the kt transition .",
    "note here that the changes in the value of @xmath176 with @xmath249 occurs in the third decimal place , while the variation in lggm takes place in the second decimal point , indicating a sharper detector of the qpt in comparison with that shown by ggm .",
    "note also that similar to localizable entanglement @xcite , lggm also signals the kt transition , which is usually not detected by the frequently - used quantum information theoretic observables in detecting qpts @xcite .",
    "note here that even for a small system where finite - size effects are expected to play a considerable role , lggm serves as a satisfactory indicator of quantum critical phenomena , and in all these examples , shows that it can act as a more powerful detector than the other multipartite entanglement measures .",
    "hence , lggm is expected to find its applicability in the investigation of quantum cooperative phenomena observed in many - body systems beyond the quantum spin chain models .",
    "multipartite entanglement has been proven to be useful for the successful implementation of several quantum information theoretic protocols . in the present paper",
    ", we consider the conceptualization and use of localizable multipartite entanglement , obtained by performing a local measurement at a few parties .",
    "the notion of localizable multiparty entanglement depends on the understanding and computability of another measure of multiparty entanglement of a lower number of parties , which we refer to as the seed measure .",
    "we use the geometric measure in general , and the generalized geometric measure in particular , as the see measure . in the case when the seed measure is the generalized geometric measure , the localizable multiparty entanglement measure is called the localizable generalized geometric measure .",
    "we discuss its various properties , and in particular , we analytically consider the behavior of the measure for a number of paradigmatic examples of multipartite pure states , where the localization is achieved via local rank-@xmath87 projective measurement over a single qubit .",
    "the examples include the @xmath4-qubit generalized ghz and w states , dicke states , and the generalized superposition of dicke states for fixed number of qubits .",
    "we show that for the @xmath4-qubit generalized ghz and w states , the localization of generalized geometric measure by local projection measurement over one qubit always results in a value of localizable multipartite entanglement which is greater than , or equal to the multipartite entanglement present in the original state .",
    "our numerical simulations seem to indicate that such enhancement due to measurement holds for arbitrary three - qubit pure states . however , for higher number of parties , no such lower bound exists .",
    "we also show that for the @xmath4-qubit dicke states , the localizable multipartite entanglement achieved via single - qubit measurement is bounded above by the generalized geometric measure of the original state .    to investigate whether measurement over more than one qubit helps in achieving a better localization of multipartite entanglement than a single - qubit measurement , we consider several examples of multi - qubit pure states .",
    "we show that there exists multiqubit states in which local measurement over two qubits yields higher values of localizable generalized geometric measure compared to single - qubit measurement .",
    "however , this phenomenon is not generic for arbitrary multiqubit states , as shown from our numerical simulations .",
    "we finally inquire whether there exists a situation in which lggm is more powerful than its parent multipartite entanglement measure , the ggm .",
    "we show that this is indeed the case for detecting qpt in the many - body systems .",
    "specifically , we show that the derivatives of lggm can signal qpt of the transverse - field ising model more accurately even for a smaller system - size , achievable in current experiments , compared to that of the ggm .",
    "we also show that lggm detects the kt transition of the xxz model better than its parent multiparty measure .",

    "<S> multiparty quantum states are useful for a variety of quantum information and computation protocols . we define a multiparty entanglement measure based on local measurements on the multiparty quantum state , and an entanglement measure averaged on the post - measurement ensemble . using the generalized geometric measure as the measure of multipartite entanglement for the ensemble , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate , in the case of several well - known classes of multipartite pure states , that the localized multipartite entanglement can exceed the entanglement present in the original state . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that measurement over multiple parties may be beneficial in enhancing localizable multipartite entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that , compared to the generalized geometric measure , localizable generalized geometric measure works better in signaling quantum critical phenomena occurring in well - known quantum spin models even when considerable finite - size effect is present in the system . </S>"
