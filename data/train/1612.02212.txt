    "[ sec1 ]    symmetry principles play an important role in summarizing the regularities of the laws of nature .",
    "although in the most of the cases symmetry principles even dictate the form of these laws , but , as it turns out , many of the texture of the world is due to various mechanisms of symmetry breaking .",
    "the latter includes explicit , spontaneous and anomalous symmetry breaking mechanisms . among them",
    "anomalous symmetry breaking is a pure quantum mechanical phenomenon , which has no counterpart in classical ( non - relativistic ) physics .",
    "if a global symmetry is anomalous , it implies that the symmetry of the classical lagrangian of the theory is not obeyed in the quantum theory . in other words ,",
    "the noether current associated with that anomalous global symmetry is no longer conserved on the quantum level .",
    "this anomaly can be determined , e.g. , by putting the theory in a background electromagnetic field , which probes the medium , and determine in this way its physical properties .",
    "recently , there have been many attempts to observe the effects of quantum chiral anomalies in experiments .",
    "in particular , heavy ion collisions ( hics ) are of enormous interest , mainly because of possible creation of very strong magnetic fields at an early stage of these collisions @xcite .",
    "the new state of matter , the plasma of quarks and gluons , which is produced at the same stage , is believed to include asymptotically free chiral fermions .",
    "the interplay between quantum anomalies with external magnetic fields results in a variety of novel non - dissipative anomalous transport phenomena in such a system ( for a recent review see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "these phenomena can principally be observed in hic experiments @xcite .",
    "some of these anomaly induced phenomena consist of chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) @xcite , chiral separation effect ( cse ) @xcite , chiral vortical effect ( cve ) @xcite , chiral vortical separation effect ( cvse ) @xcite . whereas cme refers to the generation of an electric current induced by the chirality imbalance of the medium in the presence of an external magnetic field ,",
    "cse is characterized by an axial vector current which is generated along the external magnetic field .",
    "this is quite similar to the ohm law , where an electric current is generated along an external electric field .",
    "in contrast to the ohm s coefficient , however , the transport coefficients corresponding to cme and cse currents are non - dissipative , and entirely dictated by chiral anomaly . in analogy to the external magnetic field , a global rotation of the medium , quantified by its vorticity , leads , in a medium with non - vanishing electric and axial chemical potential , to non - dissipative vector and axial vector currents , which are proportional to the vorticity of the medium .",
    "the corresponding proportionality factors are referred to as cve and cvse coefficients .    in @xcite , these anomalous transport coefficients are determined within a relativistic hydrodynamical approach in the presence of an external magnetic field . using the second law of thermodynamics and the fact that the anomaly induced currents do not contribute to entropy production @xcite ,",
    "certain algebro - differential equations are derived , whose solutions yield the anomalous transport coefficients corresponding to the aforementioned effects .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the method introduced originally in @xcite to a medium with finite magnetization and electric polarization . to the best of our knowledge , these in -",
    "medium modifications of anomalous transport coefficients , including the linear response of the medium to external electromagnetic fields , are not yet studied in the literature .",
    "they seem , however , to be important not only from theoretical point of view , but also because the experimentally relevant quark - gluon plasma turns out to have finite magnetic @xcite and electric susceptibilities @xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we introduce the ideal electro - magnetohydrodynamical ( emhd ) framework with finite magnetization and electric polarization .",
    "we essentially follow the method introduced in @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to these works , where the effect of the external electric field is neglected , we consider the case of non - vanishing magnetic _ and _ electric fields , and derive the relevant thermodynamic relations in the presence of finite magnetization _ and _ electric polarization .",
    "this brings our derivation in connection with quantum anomalies , where parallel magnetic _ and _ electric fields turn out to play a major role . in sec .",
    "[ sec3a ] , we first derive the dissipative transport coefficients of the anomalous emhd by using the second law of thermodynamics and the onsager s time reversal symmetry principle . in particular , we show that the dissipative part of the electric current as well as the viscous stress tensor include a large number of thermal and electric conductivities as well as shear and bulk viscosities .",
    "their properties are mainly affected by the anisotropies induced by external electric and magnetic fields .",
    "our results are therefore a completion of the results presented in @xcite , where the dissipative coefficients arisen from the electric field in the dissipative currents are absent .",
    "moreover , our results include certain , previously discarded , dissipative coefficients which arise from the interplay between external electric and magnetic fields [ see ( [ ee17 ] ) ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec3b ] , we eventually use the fact that the anomaly induced currents do not contribute to entropy production , and derive the corresponding algebro - differential equations to anomalous transport coefficients of this medium .",
    "we show that , within a certain second order derivative expansion , these equations include , in particular , the electric susceptibility of the medium .",
    "we then follow the method introduced in @xcite , and determine the anomalous transport coefficients by solving the above mentioned equations analytically .",
