    "interestingly , a very similar approach was being developed at the same time to study a class of closely related systems : vortices in superconducting disks@xcite .",
    "the theoretical idea for inducing the mechanical rotation and coupling of internal states using an electromagnetic field ( phase imprinting ) in the condensate was proposed later by williams and holland@xcite and the experimental confirmation was given shortly afterwards by the jila group@xcite .",
    "arrays of few singly quantized vortices were produced later with optical spoon stirring method@xcite .",
    "after these works , it was established that in a rotating bec the energetically favorable state was a triangular lattice of vortices similar to the abrikosov lattice in superconductors@xcite .",
    "ho , based on this , showed that a three dimensional bec with a big number of vortices can be described like a quantum - hall system in the lll@xcite .",
    "however , in the  ultrafast  rotating limit , where the rotation frequency @xmath0 is close to the trapping frequency @xmath1 , the gp mean field approximation fails@xcite .",
    "the study of vortices in the ultrafast limit can still be done including a quartic radial potential in the gp functional which further confines the bosons and allows a mean - field description of the bec above the critical rotation frequency@xcite .",
    "this kind of trapping potential has allowed to find experimental evidences of the melting of the vortex lattice@xcite , predicted in previous works@xcite .",
    "the vortex lattice state of a bec in symmetric potential traps has been well studied with gross - pitaevskii and thomas - fermi formalisms@xcite .",
    "recently , however , the behavior of the vortex lattice in an anisotropic potential trap has caught the attention of investigators@xcite and interest to look for unsual vortex structures in bec s under different conditions has risen@xcite .",

    "when @xmath15 grows , the system becomes more confined in the @xmath18 direction and more elongated in the @xmath19 axis .",

    "the relation between @xmath15 and @xmath0 defines the existence of only one rotating critical frequency for a given anisotropy for which the bec is just deconfined in @xmath19 .",
    "we use the oscillator length @xmath25 and the harmonic ground state energy @xmath26 as length and energy units , respectively .",
    "we propose an expansion of the wavefunction @xmath27 as a linear combination of lowest level eigenfunctions , @xmath28 , of the kinetic energy operator , the rotating term , and the trapping potential : @xmath29 by symmetry we propose eigenfunctions of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a normalization constant .",

    "an analysis of the analytical solution of the differential equation can be found in the appendix i.    now the gp functional becomes @xmath39 with @xmath40 in units of @xmath41 , @xmath42 in units of @xmath43 , and @xmath44 being the number of terms in the linear combination .",
    "the first part of the gp functional includes the kinetic , harmonic and rotating terms of the functional .",
    "the above expansion turns out to be similar to the one used by abrikosov in his description of the vortex lattice superconductors@xcite . the abrikosov lattice in superconducting strips",
    "was described using a similar expansion by one of the authors@xcite . here",
    "we make use of our previous experience to minimize semianalytically the gp functional with respect to the coefficients and the wave vectors @xmath45 , imposing the conservation of particles constraint @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the particle density . for an extended analysis of the minimization details",
    "see appendix ii .    ]",
    "we begin by addressing the case of purely parabolic confinement . an interaction of @xmath48",
    "is fixed throughout .",
    "we minimize analytically when feasible ( for up to @xmath49 ) , while for a higher number of terms we resort to numerical minimization .",
    "next we add an infinite well to the parabolic confinement to simulate a deviation from non - harmonicity .",
    "if the infinite well is thinner than the lateral extension of the bec , the bosons feel the additional confinement .",
    "the existence of the infinite potential allows us to study the bec for rotation frequencies higher than the deconfinement frequency in the spirit of ref.@xcite for axisymmetric potentials . according to our results presented below",
    ", the behavior between elongated bec s trapped by only harmonic potentials and bec s confined by stronger confinement potentials is noticeably different even for rotation frequencies smaller than the critical one .      in this section",
    "we show the behavior of an extremely elongated bec as a function of the ratio @xmath50 or the anisotropy @xmath15 ( notice that they are related to maintain the condition for critical deconfinement in the @xmath19 direction ) . in general terms ( which we detail below )",
    "we find two different families or classes of configurations ( solid and dashed - dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "those denominated `` even '' from now on have a vortex row in the center of the bec and present even parity with respect to an imaginary line along the main bec axis .",
    "in other words , they exhibit mirror symmetry , being invariant under the transformation than interchanges right and left .",
    "those without a vortex row in the middle ( denominated `` odd '' from now on ) do not present mirror symmetry , but are invariant under a combined left - right interchange and a translation by the intervortex distance .",
    "both classes of solutions are local minima of the multidimensional energetic landscape and evolve independently as the confinement varies .",
    "in other words , their different symmetry acts as a topological characteristic that keeps the two minima apart from each other in the energetic landscape , alternating in the ground state .",
    "this topological characteristic behaves in this sense as the vorticity in axisymmetric becs@xcite or superconducting disks@xcite . within each class of solutions ,",
    "vortices enter the bec progressive and continuously from the edges as the rotation increases . in general terms",
    "one can see that solutions in which the vortices are well - defined can be ground states while those where incipient vortices appear on the edge of the bec are typically not ground states ( see figs . [ even ] and [ odd ] ) .",
    "the energy and its derivative are always continuous for the odd family with some exceptions for the even family that we describe below .",
    "derivative discontinuities for this family sometimes occur in the ground state and add up to the ones that occur when the energy of the different classes cross each other ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . at",
    "the crossing points the ground state changes its topological character by increasing the number of vortex rows by one .    : 1.075 , 1.029 , 1.021 and 1.008 .",
    "lengths are in oscillator units ( o.l . ) and @xmath48 .",
    "the state in the third panel does not correspond to a ground state .",
    "[ even ] ]    : 1.075 , 1.021 , 1.008 and 1.006 .",
    "the first and the third states do not correspond to ground states . [",
    "odd ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we present a zoom of the first crossing point .",
    "for low rotation frequencies , the bec ground state is just formed by the @xmath51 component in the expansion and does not contain vortex rows ( a in fig .",
    "[ dens1 ] ) . an excited state with a very sparse vortex line can also be found at those frequencies ( c ) . in the evolution from a bec with",
    "no vortex rows to a bec with one vortex row , the ground state first develops a corrugation ( b ) .",
    "this corrugation is the precursor of the nucleation at the edge of two vortex rows ( see fig .",
    "[ odd ] ) .",
    "the states with two vortex rows are not the ground state until the vortices are fully developed ( see below ) at higher rotation frequencies .",
    "the appearance of the corrugated state presents a continuous derivative ( signaled by the long bar in [ fig1 ] ) , i.e. , the system presents a second - order phase transition before the row of vortices suddenly penetrate when the energy of the even family becomes lower and the solution with one vortex row becomes the ground state .",
    "the second - order phase transtion is not surprising since the symmetry that characterizes the odd class does not change as the corrugation developes .",
    "the corrugated states shown in fig .",
    "[ dens1 ] can be formed by up to five terms .",
    "the appropiate variational flexibility is here crucial for the correct description of this transition .",
    "as mentioned , derivative discontinuties not only occur at the crossing points where the ground state changes its number of rows and its symmetry .",
    "once the vortex row has appeared in the ground state , the sparse linear density of vortices becomes suddenly more dense ( d ) in a first - order phase transition ( short bar in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . as far as we have been able to check in our numerics , this unexpected sudden change in the ground state is not an numerical artifact , although we can not discard that a more complete expansion of the gp wave - function could smooth this transition into a second - order one .    .",
    "additional lines separate different configurations within the same family .",
    "the corresponding densities are shown in fig .",
    "[ dens1 ] ]    .",
    "lengths are in oscillator units ( o.l . ) .",
    "the transition from zero ( a , @xmath52 ) to one vortex row ( d , @xmath53 ) presents two intermediate type of states ( b , @xmath49 and c , @xmath54 ) . ]    , but for the transition from one row ( dashed - dotted line ) to two vortex rows ( solid line ) .",
    "notice the crossing intermediate state ( dashed line , @xmath55 ) . ]    .",
    "lengths are in oscillator units ( o.l . ) . ]",
    "the entrance of a second vortex row at the second crossing point also presents some peculiarities . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , before the crossing with the odd family occurs again , a solution with one vortex row , but different symmetry from the ground state ( e ) , becomes the ground state ( f ) .",
    "this new solution has a snake - like form .",
    "the fact that the symmetry is different explains why the transition is of first order .",
    "this solution is , however , almost inmediately overcome by the two - row solution ( g ) . from there on the number of rows increases one by one as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] , [ even ] , and [ odd ] .",
    "numerical limitations prevent us from making a thourough study of the crossing points as we have done in the first two , but we expect similar intermediate solutions to appear near the crossing points .      fixing the interaction energy @xmath48 and including an infinite well of width @xmath56 we find a similar zero - one vortex row transition behavior for a non - parabolic confinement .",
    "this is expected since the dispersion relations for the parabolic and quasi - parabolic cases are fairly similar in the center of the condensate ( for the chosen width ) . for a small rotation frequency",
    "the vectors @xmath45 of the expansion place themselves near the center and are nearly the same as those for the parabolic case .",
    "however for narrower wells , i. e. , @xmath57 , the dispersion relation deviates strongly from the parabolic case due to the presence of the infinite potential . for the @xmath56 system",
    "we find that the one - two vortex row transition does not show the snake - like intermediate ground state .",
    "this solution has always a greater energy than the ground states with two vortex rows as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .    .",
    "the zig - zagging configuration is not a ground state for any rotation frequency .",
    "the correspondent densities are similar to the densities in fig .",
    "[ dens2 ] .",
    "[ fig4 ] ]    .",
    "all the intermediate states dissapear from the transition .",
    "[ fig6 ] ]    for the well of width @xmath57 the transition from no vortex to one vortex row losses all the intermediate ground states ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "these results lead us to conclude that the infinite potential suppresses intermediate configurations between transitions that changes the number of rows by one .",
    "we also find that the effects of the boundary in the condensate favors configurations without regular triangular form .",
    "for example , when the condensate rotation frequency is close to the critical frequency , the extra confinement induces states with a quasi - square lattice of vortices with energies near the triangular ground state .",
    "for pure parabolic confinement this state does not appear in our calculations .",
    "although a square lattice was found experimentally in non - equilibrium elongated systems@xcite , here , the square lattice only appears when an aditional confinement potential is added to the condensate and it does not seem to become the ground state of the system for as far as we have been able to check . the functional energies and the densities of these states are shown in figs .",

    "however , for frequencies close to the critical frequency the triangular vortex lattice is still the ground state . finally for ultrafast rotation",

    "we have minimized the gross - pitaevskii functional with the usual particle number constraint for the problem of a bec in an infinitely long rotating channel .",
    "we find the appearance of vortex rows in the bec along the longitudinal direction as the rotation increases .",
    "the solutions alternate between those with a vortex row in the center of the channel and those with a maximum in the bec density . for simple parabolic confinement",
    "we find intermediate states with non - trivial topologies .",
    "when an infinite potential is added at the boundary of the bec , this intermediate states do not appear in the ground state anymore .",
    "this extra confinement produces higher energy solutions in the form of a square vortex lattice and for ultrafast rotation the bec splits into two channels at the edges .",
