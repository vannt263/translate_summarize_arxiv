    "within this decade , the lhc will play a significant role in probing the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions and disentangling the models beyond it .",
    "the progress expected in experimental high energy physics will complement theoretical explorations of various scenarios of new physics .",
    "the experimental data could confirm any of the many theoretical models of new physics advanced over the last decades .",
    "one of the first observations expected at the lhc is the higgs boson .",
    "this is the one remaining piece of puzzle missing from the sm and on this finding rests our understanding of mass generation .",
    "however , most models beyond the sm also predict the existence of one or more higgs bosons . some of them might be heavy , but several are expected to be light . while the standard model contains one neutral higgs boson ,",
    "many models predict one or more higgs doublets , thus at least one charged higgs boson ( such as the many variants of the two higgs doublet models and supersymmetry ) .",
    "finding a light charged higgs boson would raise problems as to which fundamental gauge symmetry is responsible for its existence .",
    "the hope of a clearer signal rests on more exotic higgs bosons , such as the ones predicted in left - right models @xcite .",
    "left - right symmetric models with seesaw neutrino mass generation @xcite predict doubly - charged higgs bosons @xcite , which , if light , would give distinctive and spectacular signals at the colliders .    including supersymmetry adds several attractive features to the left - right model @xcite .",
    "softly - broken supersymmetry resolves some of the inconsistencies of the standard model : it provides a solution to the gauge hierachy problem , a natural candidate for weakly - interacting dark matter , and allows for gauge coupling unification .",
    "in addition , the left - right supersymmetric model ( lrsusy ) accounts for neutrino masses @xcite , parity violation , offers a solution to the strong and weak cp violation without introduction of the axion @xcite , and explains the absence of excessive susy cp violation .",
    "left - right symmetry is favored by many extra - dimensional models , and many gauge unification scenarios , such as @xmath4 @xcite",
    ".    however the model seems to suffer from a serious shortcoming .",
    "minimization of the higgs potential requires either spontaneous @xmath0parity breaking by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the right - chiral scalar neutrino @xcite ; or introduction of higher scale non - renormalizable operators @xcite .",
    "since an attractive characteristic of the left - right supersymmetric model is that explicit @xmath0parity breaking is forbidden by the symmetry of the model , spontaneous breaking is not a desirable feature .",
    "ditto for higher order operators at the planck scale .",
    "the shortcoming comes from the fact that , in the simplest version of the model , the global minimum of the theory breaks electric charge , making the theory unacceptable .",
    "this can be remedied by allowing a vev for the right sneutrino .",
    "the higgs boson spectrum was previously analyzed in this variant of the model with @xmath0parity violation where sneutrinos and sleptons mix with the higgs bosons @xcite .",
    "however , a new version of the theory suggested by babu and mohapatra @xcite , allows for both @xmath0parity conservation _ and _ the absence of higher - dimensional operators by inclusion of the yukawa coupling of the heavy majorana neutrino in the effective lagrangian .",
    "we study the higgs sector of such a model and examine the masses of the doubly - charged , singly charged and neutral bosons ( both scalar and pseudoscalar sectors ) .",
    "although the model depends on many parameters , we show that the masses are sensitive to only a few , and thus the model is more predictive .",
    "light doubly - charged higgs bosons emerge naturally .",
    "the lrsusy model predicts neutral scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons that violate flavor at tree level .",
    "we impose conditions coming from phenomenology : @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath5 mixing .",
    "we show that , contrary to previous expectations , one can have light neutral and charged higgs bosons that conserve flavor , while the flavor violating bosons are in the 600 gev- 100 tev scale , as required by meson mixing constraints .",
    "we pinpoint the parameters that the masses are most sensitive to , and show that they satisfy the constraints in a limited range of these parameters .",
    "we set up the structure of the higgs potential , masses and mixing , including the constraints , while leaving the study of the characteristic signals at the lhc for a future study .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ lrsusy ]",
    "we summarize the particular lrsusy model we use , with emphasis on the higgs structure . in the following section ( [ results ] )",
    "we present analytic formulas for the mass matrices in the neutral , singly - charged and doubly - charged sectors . in section [ constraints ]",
    "we present the results of the constraints from @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath5 mixings on the higgs masses and mixings .",
    "we illustrate our results by showing two numerical scenarios for desirable higgs mass values for the model which satisfy the constraints in section [ discussion ] as well as presenting plots for masses consistent with the constraints .",

    "the supersymmetric left - right model incorporates supersymmetry in the left - right model based on the gauge symmetry @xmath6 . including the @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 and @xmath9 stand for baryon and lepton numbers ) in a gauge symmetry , the only quantum number left ungauged in sm , is an additional attractive feature of the model .",

    "this explicit @xmath13-parity breaking is forbidden in lrsusy models by the symmetries of the model . in early left - right symmetric models",
    "@xmath11 doublets were used to break the gauge symmetry .",
    "later @xmath16 triplets were introduced to provide the seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses @xcite , and both left- and right - handed triplet higgs bosons are required by parity conservation .",
    "the model was described extensively in several previous works @xcite .",
    "however @xmath13-parity may not be conserved in this setup .",
    "the reason is that the minimum of the potential prefers a solution in which the right - chiral scalar neutrino gets a vev , thus breaking @xmath13-parity spontaneously .",
    "two scenarios have been proposed which remedy this situation .",
    "one is the model of babu and mohapatra @xcite where an extra singlet higgs boson is added to the model and one - loop corrections to the potential show that an @xmath13-parity conserving minimum can be found .",

    "the singlet field @xmath33 is introduced to so that @xmath28 symmetry breaking occurs in the supersymmetric limit .",
    "the charge is defined as @xmath34 the vevs of the higgs fields in this model needed to break the symmetries as described above , are given in table 1 .",
    "if we assume that the vevs of the bidoublet higgs are real , the fermion mass matrices become hermitian .",
    "the vevs of the left  handed triplet fields @xmath35 , which determine the tree - level left - handed neutrino masses must be extremely small and are assumed to be zero .    in the supersymmetric limit ,",
    "the vev of the singlet @xmath33 higgs boson is zero , but after susy breaking , @xmath36 .",
    "thus the @xmath25 term for the bidoublet @xmath37 will arise from the coupling @xmath38 , with a magnitude of order @xmath39 @xcite . in the susy limit , @xmath40 the vev of @xmath33 field , generated after susy breaking , arises from linear terms in susy breaking @xmath41 minimization of the resulting potential yields @xmath42 , which is of order @xmath39 .",
    "if the coupling @xmath43 is small , then @xmath44 can be above the susy breaking scale .",
    "this feature can be used to make one pair of higgs doublet superfields heavier than the susy breaking scale .",
    "however , the masses of doubly charged fermionic fields , which are equal to @xmath45 must remain below a tev .",
    "consistency of the model ( non - vanishing ckm mixing angle ) requires the asymmetry @xmath46 .",
    "the full potential of the model relevant for symmetry breaking includes @xmath47-term , @xmath48-term and soft susy breaking contributions .",
    "they are given by @xmath49 all terms in the scalar potential are identical for the configurations in which vevs are given to the neutral right - handed triplet higgs , or the charged higgs , except for the @xmath50term , which is lower for the charge breaking configuration .",
    "previous solutions suggested are breaking @xmath0parity , which would have the attractive feature that @xmath51 tev , but which abandons the lsp as the candidate for dark matter @xcite ; or introducing higher dimensional operators to lower the charge conserving vacuum , with @xmath52 gev , but loosing the solution to strong and weak cp violation @xcite .",
    "more recently , a new version of the model @xcite examined effective operators which generate terms of the form @xmath53 at one loop level , induced by the majorana neutrino @xmath54 couplings with @xmath55 . these operators mimic the effects of the higher dimensional operators in previous versions , without the need to introduce them explicitly , thus solving the problem of the global minimum ( if their coefficient is positive ) .",
    "the advantage of such a formalism is that the masses are very predictive , as they do not depend on coefficients of ad - hoc higher order terms , or sneutrino vevs . in the next section ,",
    "we study explicitly the implications for the higgs masses in this model .",
    "the higgs boson spectrum was previously analyzed in a variant of the model @xcite with @xmath0parity violation .",
    "the new features of the present analysis are 1 ) we employ a version of the model that uses the right - chiral neutrino couplings to the triplet higgs bosons to eliminate the need for @xmath9-number violation ; and 2 ) we include constraints from fcnc processes to predict the range of higgs masses and parameters in lrsusy .",
    "effectively , we are looking at a very different model and higgs sector than in @xcite .",
    "we proceed the usual way to find the masses and mixing matrices for the higgs bosons in this model .",
    "we minimize the higgs potential given in the previous section , taking into account corrections induced by the heavy majorana neutrino yukawa couplings .",

    "however , upon inspection , the only significant dependence is on @xmath214 , much like the doubly charged higgs boson .",
    "the reason is that , requiring one doubly charged higgs to be light makes the lightest singly charged higgs to be an eigenstate of the @xmath259 mass matrix @xmath260 .",
    "there is a slight difference between the lightest singly charged and lightest doubly charged higgs boson , but the difference comes from sm - like observables in @xmath261 , and it is overwhelmed by parameters proportional to @xmath214 and @xmath226 .",
    "its mass also increases with the increasing values of @xmath218 , and depends on the ratio @xmath262 in much the same way as the mass of the doubly charged higgs does .",
    "thus we do not show the dependence separately .",
    "finally , we present two explicit numerical scenarios for the higgs masses , which obey the constraints from meson mixings : one for @xmath263 tev and @xmath200 , the other for @xmath264 tev and @xmath265 .",
    "the other parameters in both scenarios are taken to be @xmath266 , @xmath267 tev , @xmath268 , @xmath269 , @xmath270 tev , @xmath271 tev , @xmath272 tev .",
    "we give masses and compositions in terms of the bare states .",
    "one can see that , except for raising the lightest neutral higgs mass , increasing @xmath244 has little effect on the spectrum .",
    "however raising @xmath214 increases the mass of the lighter non - sm - like higgs bosons in the neutral scalar and pseudoscalar sector , as well as in the singly and doubly charged higgs sectors .",
    "while we did not prove in general that the model conserves @xmath13-parity , the numerical results obtained from minimizing the masses confirm the results of @xcite . both of these scenarios allow for a pair of light flavor - conserving neutral scalar higgs bosons ( one sm - like , one mostly triplet @xmath10 ) ; as well as for one light singly charged higgs and a pair of doubly charged higgs bosons .",
    "the fcnc higgs responsible for mixing in the up ( @xmath242 ) or down ( @xmath180 and @xmath273 ) quark sectors are heavy and satisfy the experimental constraints in each sector .",
    "we analyzed the higgs sector of a minimal left - right supersymmetric model with automatic @xmath13-parity violation .",
    "symmetries of the model forbid explicit @xmath13-parity violation .",
    "inclusion of the effects of the yukawa coupling of the heavy majorana neutrino insures a global minimum which is charge conserving , thus avoiding spontaneous @xmath13-parity breaking or the need to introduce higher dimensional terms .",
    "the higgs sector contains four doubly charged higgs , six singly charged higgs fields , nine neutral scalar fields , and seven pseudoscalar fields ( in addition to two neutral goldstone bosons , and two charged ones ) .",
    "one would expect that , with so many free parameters in the lagrangian , and so many free masses , almost any scenario is possible for the higgs masses in this model .",
    "we show that the requirement that 1 ) there is a light neutral scalar higgs boson , flavor conserving , which is the counterpart to the sm higgs boson ; 2 ) there exist at least one light doubly charged higgs boson ( as it is interesting for phenomenology ) ; and 3 ) the flavor - violating neutral higgs bosons satisfy the constraints imposed by the experimental data from @xmath180 , @xmath242 , and @xmath273 mixings , makes the higgs sector fairly predictive and fixes some of the parameters in a narrow range .",
    "the masses of the light neutral and doubly charged higgs bosons depend on very few parameters .",
    "for instance , we find that requirement 1 ) and 2 ) are related , and satisfied by @xmath274 tev range .",
    "assuming @xmath275 and @xmath276 , this predicts masses for the @xmath277 around @xmath278 tev ( assuming negligible mixing with @xmath279 ) , and for @xmath280 bosons in the @xmath281 tev range .",
    "thus , while the model can allow for light neutral , singly and doubly charged higgs bosons , it predicts new gauge bosons just outside the range @xmath282 tev which can be observed at the lhc with a luminosity of 0.1(30 ) fb@xmath283 @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath226 , associated with the singlet higgs field in the superpotential , must be of @xmath284(100 ) tev , which insures high masses for the fcnc higgs .",
    "our analysis is important for two reasons : first , we have shown that a reasonable higgs mass spectrum is possible in lrsusy , without all higgs masses being required to be heavy .",
    "we can require that the higgs generating tree - level fcnc in the @xmath285 and @xmath8 mesons are heavy , but still obtain two light neutral higgs bosons , one light pseudoscalar , one light singly charged higgs boson , and a pair of light doubly charged higgs bosons .",
    "second , as most higgs masses are sensitive to few parameters , the model is very predictive and free of additional parameters , such as the sneutrino vevs or extra higher - dimensional terms .",
    "third , the non - sm light higgs are mostly triplet @xmath10 bosons and expected to decay copiously to leptons , but not to quarks , giving clear distinguishing signals for the model .",
    "this analysis can now form the basis of a consistent phenomenological study of signals from such a higgs sector , including production and decay rates , and has implications for the masses of the additional gauge bosons , as well as for the right - handed neutrinos .",
