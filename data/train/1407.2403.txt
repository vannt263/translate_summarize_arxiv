    "the _ quasihyperbolic metric _ in @xmath1 is a natural generalization of the hyperbolic metric , introduced by gehring @xcite and his students palka and osgood in 1970 s as a tool for studying quasiconformal mappings . since its introduction",
    ", this metric has found numerous applications to the geometric function theory @xcite .",
    "furthermore , quasihyperbolic metric can be studied in more general settings than @xmath1 , such as banach spaces and even in general metric spaces .",
    "it has particular significance in the infinite dimensional settings , where many traditional tools , such as the conformal modulus , can not be used .",
    "this approach to geometric function theory was developed by j. visl in a series of papers .",
    "this theory is called `` the free quasiworld '' according to visl ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "introductory discussion and motivations for the study of this topic are presented in detail in the survey article @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we continue our investigation of the properties of this metric in euclidean and banach spaces , see @xcite .",
    "we will settle a long - standing problem of whether quasihyperbolic balls of a convex domain on a uniformly smooth banach space are smooth ( see remark [ gehring_rugby ] ) .",
    "our smoothness considerations yield as a byproduct a new renorming technique of banach spaces as well .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the quasihyperbolic metric is differentiable in a large dense set of points if the banach space in question satisfies some modest regularity assumptions , e.g. it is separable or has a separable dual , see theorem [ thm : asplund ] .",
    "this approach is made possible by the fact that the underlying banach space geometry is conveyed to the geometric properties of the quasihyperbolic metric .",
    "thus we have access to the functional analysis machinery in studying the properties of the quasihyperbolic metric .",
    "this includes topics such as the convexity of balls and smoothness of geodesics , and an approach to analyzing these matters was developed in our earlier papers @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . shortly , in section [ sect : motiv ] , we explain the justification for the quasihyperbolic metric .",
    "after that we provide the main references and some more required definitions . in section [",
    "sect : smooth ] we prove our main result involving the @xmath0-smoothness of the quasihyperbolic metric . as mentioned above , we also prove that under rather weak assumptions on the banach space the metric is differentiable in a dense large set of points .",
    "also , some results related to smoothness of the inner metrics are given in a purely metric setting . in section [",
    "sect : ultra ] we develop geometric tools by using non - standard analysis , stating roughly that if two families of paths are close after a quasihyperbolical state change , then they are close in absolute terms",
    ". then , in section [ sect : renorm ] , we discuss a promising and unexpected connection between geometric function theory and functional analysis , namely using the quasihyperbolic metric to construct banach space renormings .",
    "we apply the abovementioned tool in the proof of theorem [ thm : unifconv ] and in this connection it becomes a kind of variational principle .",
    "the main goal there is approximating arbitrary equivalent norms with well behaved ones induced by quasihyperbolic balls .",
    "finally , we give some counterexamples in hilbertian and euclidean spaces .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 is a banach space and @xmath3 is a domain with non - empty boundary .",
    "denote by @xmath4 the distance of the point @xmath5 from the boundary of @xmath6 .",
    "then the _ quasihyperbolic ( qh ) metric _ on the domain @xmath6 is defined by the formula @xmath7 where the infimum is taken over all rectifiable curves @xmath8 in @xmath6 connecting the points @xmath9 in @xmath6 . if the infimum is attained for some rectifiable curve @xmath8 , this curve is called a _",
    "quasihyperbolic geodesic_. if there is no danger of confusion , we write @xmath10 instead of @xmath11 .",
    "the formula has several important special cases . for @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ,",
    "i.e. , the upper half - space , we obtain the well - known _ hyperbolic metric _",
    "@xmath15 ( see @xcite ) , also known as the _ poincar metric_. the hyperbolic metric can also be developed in the unit disk @xmath16 by using the formula @xmath17 where the infimum is taken over all regular curves @xmath8 connecting @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this metric is conformally invariant in the following sense .",
    "suppose that @xmath20 is a conformal mapping of the unit disk onto itself .",
    "then , by pick s lemma , we have the identity @xmath21 this means that , for any regular curve @xmath8 in the unit disk , we have @xmath22 note that the denominators above are asymptotically equivalent to that in .    by using conformal invariance ,",
    "the hyperbolic metric can be studied for other simply connected domains in the plane , and in the case of the half - plane it coincides with the metric defined by .",
    "but even in @xmath1 , the hyperbolic metric can not be defined for domains other than half - spaces and balls for @xmath23 .",
    "the method based on conformal invariance does not apply to general banach spaces .    in general , the quasihyperbolic metric is not conformally invariant , but it behaves well under conformal and even quasiconformal mappings .",
    "this fact is of particular importance in infinite dimensional spaces , where many convenient tools for studying quasiconformal mappings , such as local compactness and measure , are not available . besides quasiconformal mappings ,",
    "the quasihyperbolic metric has recently found novel and interesting applications in other fields of geometric analysis as well .",
    "for example , quasihyperbolic metric has been recently used in study of the poincar inequality @xcite .    from basic analysis of the hyperbolic disk and conformal invariance",
    ", it immediately follows that the hyperbolic geodesics originating from the point @xmath5 are always orthogonal to the surfaces of hyperbolic balls centered at @xmath18 ( see figure [ fig : hyper ] ) .",
    "it is not obvious that a similar property holds for the quasihyperbolic metric .",
    "this very useful connection between quasihyperbolic geodesics and balls will be established in theorem [ orto ] , and then exploited to obtain further results on quasihyperbolic balls .",

    "it follows from the arguments provided by visl and martio in @xcite that there exists a quasihyperbolic geodesic between any two points in a convex domain of a locally weak - star compact ( e.g. reflexive ) space .",

    "first , as we have seen here , the approximation part comes for free , only thing that is left to do is to analyze the quasihyperbolic balls regarding the favorable property .",
    "secondly , the analysis of the quasihyperbolic balls is usually not sensitive to whether or not the space is separable . also , the way the quasihyperbolic inner metric is defined appears to have a mildly smoothening effect on the resulting norms , per se .",
    "suppose that @xmath286 is a uniformly smooth banach space .",
    "then each equivalent norm can be approximated uniformly on bounded sets by uniformly smooth norms induced by the quasihyperbolic balls , similarly as in proposition [ prop : equiv ] .    moreover ,",
    "if the modulus of smoothness of the norm @xmath33 has power type @xmath287 , then the approximating norms have all the power types less than @xmath288 .",
    "let @xmath289 . by the proof of theorem [ thm : uf ]",
    "we know that @xmath77 is continuously frchet differentiable on domains @xmath290 with suitable @xmath291 .",
    "now , since @xmath292 is the level set of a continuously frchet differentiable function , a standard argument employing the implicit function theorem gives that the norm @xmath293 is also continuously frchet differentiable , see @xcite .    in fact , in estimating from above the modulus of smoothness of the @xmath294 norms , we may restrict by geometric considerations to a version of the modulus as follows : @xmath295 here @xmath296 where @xmath252 is the isomorphism constant involving the equivalent norms @xmath33 and @xmath281 .",
    "this constant depends on the particular norm @xmath297 but it may be replaced by one universal to all the norms @xmath294 , @xmath298 .",
    "suppose that @xmath299 .",
    "then @xmath300 by the definition of the @xmath77 metric .",
    "thus , for large @xmath262 the above infimum becomes larger than @xmath252 , so that asymptotically @xmath301 holds .",
    "the latter quantity is controlled in the proof of theorem [ thm : uf ] .",
    "recall that the modulus of convexity @xmath302 need not be a convex function .",
    "however , it has a greatest convex minorant and we denote this by @xmath303 .    [ thm : unifconv ] suppose that @xmath2 is a uniformly convex banach space , @xmath3 is a symmetric convex domain and @xmath304 for some @xmath156 .",
    "then the equivalent norm @xmath305 on @xmath2 is uniformly convex .",
    "moreover , any equivalent norm on @xmath2 can be approximated uniformly on bounded sets by uniformly convex norms arising from such quasihyperbolic balls @xmath96 .",
    "fix @xmath306 .",
    "let @xmath307 and @xmath308 .",
    "note that the formal identity mappings @xmath309 and @xmath310 are bilipschitz due to the fact that on @xmath96 the weight @xmath101 is bounded , see the proof of theorem [ thm : uf ] .",
    "let @xmath311 with @xmath312 and @xmath313 . in order to prove the uniform convexity of @xmath281 it suffices to prove that @xmath314 by the equivalence of the norms .",
    "there exists by the uniform convexity of @xmath2 and the convexity of the domain unique geodesics @xmath85 and @xmath181 from @xmath134 to @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .    without loss of generality",
    "we may assume that @xmath85 and @xmath181 are parametrized by the quasihyperbolic length .",
    "then @xmath315 where @xmath316 are norm-@xmath103 for a.e .",
    "@xmath317 $ ] .",
    "also , @xmath318    note that @xmath319 where we use the convexity of the domain , see lemma [ lm : plconvex ] .",
    "put @xmath320    observe that @xmath321    the conclusion from this is that if @xmath313 as @xmath90 , then @xmath322 as @xmath90 .",
    "we will complete the proof by applying the variational principle of theorem [ thm : uf ] .",
    "then it follows that @xmath323 , @xmath324 satisfy @xmath325 which then implies the uniform convexity of @xmath326 .",
    "finally , we will check that the assumptions of theorem [ thm : uf ] hold .",
    "since @xmath2 is uniformly convex it is in particular superreflexive .",
    "observe that the weight @xmath327 is lipschitz and bounded below by @xmath328    since the paths are parametrized by the quasihyperbolic length , we can choose @xmath252 appearing in the assumptions to be @xmath329 . since @xmath322 we get the ` if ' part of the theorem .",
    "to obtain we apply the proof of theorem 3.1 in @xcite with a modification .",
    "the condition is obtained by using the triangle inequality on ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath330 ) ( sic ) .",
    "here @xmath2 is a uniformly convex space and @xmath163 is lipschitz continuous with constant @xmath331 we will relax the assumption about the power type of the modulus of convexity as follows .",
    "the largest convex minorant @xmath332 of @xmath333 is strictly increasing ( see e.g. @xcite ) , therefore @xmath334 exists .",
    "one can use the definition @xmath335 to get ( * ? ? ? * @xmath330 ) .",
    "this convention will not be sufficient to obtain ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath336 ) , a priori , but that is not required for our purposes .",
    "this concludes the proof .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 is a strictly convex banach space with the rnp .",
    "then each equivalent norm can be approximated uniformly on bounded sets by strictly convex norms induced by the quasihyperbolic balls , similarly as above .",
    "the argument is based on the fact that quasihyperbolic balls in a convex domain of a strictly convex banach space with the rnp are strictly convex as well , see @xcite .",
    "note that it is not essential here whether @xmath337 is strictly convex or not .",
    "we do not know if quasihyperbolic balls in symmetric convex domains of reflexive lur banach spaces and centered at the origin induce lur norms via the minkowski functional .",
    "there exists examples of domains in hilbert spaces , which are not geodesic with respect to the quasihyperbolic metric . for more details",
    "see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 2.9 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 3.5 ) .",
    "however , in these examples the complement of the domain is uncountable .",
    "we give an example of a domain that is not geodesic with respect to the quasihyperbolic metric and the complement of the domain is countable .    let @xmath338 there does not exists a quasihyperbolic geodesic from @xmath339 to @xmath340 in @xmath6",
    ".    in @xmath341 the geodesics @xmath342 are half circles with center at 0 . since @xmath343 we have @xmath344 let @xmath8 be a curve joining @xmath339 to @xmath340 .",
    "if @xmath8 is not a half circle , then @xmath345 if @xmath8 is a half circle , then for some @xmath262 we have @xmath346 implying @xmath347 .",
    "let us consider @xmath85 to be a half circle with center at origin , end points @xmath339 and @xmath340 such that for each @xmath348 we have @xmath349 , \\quad 0 = x_2 = \\cdots = x_{n-1 } = x_{n+2 } = \\cdots , \\quad x_{n } = x_{n+1}\\ ] ] for some @xmath350 .",
    "by construction of @xmath6 we have @xmath351 and @xmath352 .",
    "thus , there does not exist a quasihyperbolic geodesic .",
    "finally , we take this opportunity to address some related finite - dimensional questions involving the quasihyperbolic metric that arouse during our research .    in the upper half - plane",
    "the quasihyperbolic geodesics agree with the hyperbolic geodesics and are thus unique .",
    "however , if a plane domain is not simply connected the quasihyperbolic geodesics need not be unique .",
    "the following results shows that for any @xmath353 there exists a domain and at least two geodesics with exactly @xmath262 common points .      in the case of",
    "@xmath360 we can choose @xmath361 , @xmath362 and @xmath363 .",
    "now there exists exactly two geodesics joining @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which are half circles , and we choose them to be @xmath61 and @xmath364 .",
    "we obtain @xmath365 and the assertion follows .",
    "we choose @xmath370 and @xmath371 . finally , we find the geodesics @xmath61 and @xmath364 .",
    "let @xmath61 be the geodesic , which consists of circular arcs and is contained in the closed upper half - plane @xmath372 , see figure [ fig : example domain ] .",
    "then @xmath373              let first @xmath385 , @xmath386 , @xmath387 and @xmath388 .",
