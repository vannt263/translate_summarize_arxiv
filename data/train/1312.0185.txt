    "baryon - anti - baryon flavor correlation is usually regarded as a sensitive variable to test different hadronization models thus always draws much attention in studying hadronization mechanism in different high energy reactions .",
    "earlier studies can be found e.g. in @xmath2 annihilations @xcite and recently many discussions have been made in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the most direct measurable quantity describing baryon - anti - baryon flavor correlation is the anti - baryon to baryon yield ratio @xmath3 in a given kinematic region , where @xmath4 denotes different types of baryons , and @xmath5 denotes the average yield of the hadron @xmath6 .",
    "there are already quite abundant data available on yields of different @xmath7 s and the corresponding @xmath8 s in heavy ion collision experiments at different energies for reactions using different nuclei , and from these data anti - baryon to baryon yield ratios have been @xcite and/or can be @xcite calculated .",
    "it is interesting to see that the results seem to exhibit universal behaviors for @xmath3 as functions of @xmath9 @xcite .    in a recent paper @xcite , we study the hadron yield correlations in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the hadrons are produced in the combination mechanism .",
    "the formalism is obtained by using the following two approximations and/or general assumptions :    \\(1 ) factorization : the flavor and momentum dependences of the combination kernel function are factorized and the momentum distributions of quarks and/or anti - quarks are taken as flavor independent ;    \\(2 ) independent flavor production : the probability for production of different flavors in each of the new born quark - anti - quark pair in the reaction is taken as a constant independent from each other .",
    "hence the numbers of different flavors of the newly produced quarks and anti - quarks follow the polynominal distribution with strangeness suppression factor @xmath10 .",
    "the influence of net - quarks originated from the incident nuclei is taken into account by modifying the strangeness suppression factor for quark to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the average numbers of net - quarks and quarks respectively .",
    "under these two assumptions , we have shown that there exist a set of relationships between the yields of different hadrons produced in the combination process .",
    "we presented the results for the case where only @xmath15 and @xmath16 mesons , @xmath17 and @xmath18 baryons are taken into account and showed that they are consistent with the data available .",
    "apparently @xmath3 is one special example of the hadron yield ratios describing hadron yield correlation studied in @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask whether the data in particular the universal behaviors mentioned above can also be described by the formalism given there and whether there are more sensitive measurable quantities to describe the baryon - anti - baryon flavor correlation in heavy ion collisions .",
    "this note is intended to be an addendum to @xcite . here",
    ", we apply the formalism given in @xcite to study the baryon - anti - baryon flavor correlation .",
    "we calculate @xmath3 and propose other measurable quantities that can be used for the studies in this respect .",
    "in @xcite , we derived that , in the combination mechanism with the two approximations and/or assumptions mentioned above , hadron yields are given as functions of the strange suppression factor @xmath10 , the effective strangeness suppression factor @xmath21 , the average number of baryons @xmath22 and that for mesons @xmath23 .",
    "in particular , the anti - baryon to baryon yield ratios are quite simple .",
    "they are the same for the directly produced ones and those in the final states including strong and electromagnetic decay contributions , and are given by @xcite , @xmath24 similarly , for kaons in the final state , we have , @xmath25 where the superscript @xmath26 denotes the results for hadrons in the final states . from these equations , we see that if there is no net - quark contribution , i.e. , @xmath13 or @xmath27 , we have @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and hence all the ratios shown by eqs .",
    "( [ pbarp]-[kmkp ] ) are unity .",
    "we also see that , at a given @xmath10 , @xmath30 is a singly valued decreasing function of @xmath31 .",
    "we insert @xmath11 into eq .",
    "( [ kmkp ] ) and obtain , @xmath32 here , we not only clearly see that @xmath33 is a singly valued function of @xmath31 but also see that , for small @xmath31 , @xmath33 is basically nothing else but @xmath34 .    also , from eqs .",
    "( [ pbarp]-[obaro ] ) , we see that , besides @xmath35 , the yield ratios of @xmath8 to @xmath7 are also functions of @xmath31 . it can also be expected that @xmath35 should also be a function of @xmath31 .",
    "in fact , in @xcite , we derived that , for reasonably large @xmath36 ( @xmath37 , say ) , in combination mechanism , the ratio of the average number of anti - baryons to mesons produced in the process can be parameterized with good approximation by , @xmath38 and this leads to , @xmath39 we insert eq .",
    "( [ eq : bbarb ] ) into eqs .",
    "( [ pbarp]-[obaro ] ) and obtain , @xmath40 we see that they are functions of @xmath31 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bbarbvsgamma ] , we present the results of these ratios as functions of @xmath31 . during the calculations , we also find out that the results are not very sensitive to the value of the strangeness suppression factor @xmath10 but there are some influences in particular for @xmath41 to @xmath42 ratio . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bbarbvsgamma ] , we show besides the results obtained at @xmath43 that is usually used in heavy ion collisions and also two limiting cases for @xmath44 ( no strange suppression ) and the maximum strange suppression by taking the limit at @xmath45 for comparison .     for different values of @xmath10.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    we see that all these ratios are indeed monotonically decreasing functions of @xmath31 .",
    "we see in particular that @xmath30 deviates little from @xmath46 which just corresponds to the limit at @xmath47 shown in the figure .",
    "because of this , we can simply use @xmath30 to replace @xmath31 and express the anti - baryon to baryon ratios as functions of @xmath30 .",
    "we emphasize that these functions should be universal in the sense that they are consequences of the combination mechanism with the assumptions of factorization and flavor independent production mentioned in the introduction of this note .",
    "they should be independent of the nuclei used in the collisions , independent of the reaction energies .",
    "furthermore , they should also be the same in different kinematic regions , and also the same for different centralities as long as the combination mechanism is at work .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bbarb - k ] , we show the results compared with the data obtained by different collaborations .",
    "these data are taken from refs .",
    "those from star and na49 are all for central rapidity regions such as @xmath48 , while those from na44 are for rapidity regions around @xmath49 to @xmath50 , and those from brahms are for different rapidity intervals in the whole rapidity regions .",
    "we see that the results are indeed in good agreement with the data available @xcite .",
    "to @xmath1 compared with the data from different experiments @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    furthermore , from eqs .",
    "( [ pbarp]-[obaro ] ) , we also see clearly that , if we build the ratio between any two @xmath51 s from them , we obtain a very simple result , i.e. , a power of @xmath52 . for example , we have , @xmath53 they are valid for both directly produced baryons and those in the final states .",
    "we emphasize that these relationships are more intrinsic in the combination mechanism since they are independent of e.g. the parameterization given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bbarm ] ) .",
    "they could provide more sensitive tests to the hadronization mechanism .",
    "such kinds of  mixed ratios \" of yields of hadrons have been analysed in experiments such as given in @xcite where results on @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57^{0.5}$ ] at @xmath58 gev derived from the measurements by star collaboration are given .",
    "we plot them in fig .",
    "[ mixr ] ( a ) .",
    "similar hadron yield ratios have also been given by star collaboration with energy scan @xcite .",
    "we calculate the corresponding ratios using them and show the results in the same figure .",
    "also , there are data at lhc and sps energies @xcite .",
    "we show the results derived from them in fig .",
    "[ mixr ] ( b ) .",
    "all the data are for different energies but all in the central rapidity regions .     +    from fig .",
    "[ mixr ] ( a ) and ( b ) , we see that , at relatively high energies such as those at high rhic and lhc , these ratios indeed fall into one straight horizontal line respectively , consistent with the results given by eq .",
    "( [ qct - f ] ) .",
    "however , at lower energies , in particular , at @xmath59 gev and @xmath60 agev , there seems indications that the results deviate from those expected in the quark combination mechanism with the two assumptions and/or approximations mentioned in the introduction part of this note .",
    "this might be taken as a signature of the failure of the quark combination mechanism in this energy range .",
    "more precise measurements are needed to clarify this .",
    "another quantity to measure the baryon - anti - baryon flavor correlation can be the correlation factor @xmath62 defined as , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the number of all possible @xmath65 pairs in the system considered .",
    "clearly , if the flavor of anti - baryon and that of baryon are completely uncorrelated , we have , @xmath66 for the case that the flavor of @xmath8 is completely correlated with that of @xmath7 , we have , @xmath67 and @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the dispersion of the distribution of @xmath70 . for example , if @xmath70 distributes as a poissonian , we have @xmath71 , thus @xmath72 ; if @xmath70 distributes as a negative binomial , we have , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is a parameter in the negative binomial distribution .    in the combination model as formulated in @xcite with the two approximations and/or assumptions of factorization and independent flavor production mentioned in the introduction part of this note , @xmath62 can be easily calculated .",
    "the result is given by , @xmath76 they are all the same for different combinations of @xmath7 and @xmath77 .",
    "if we scale @xmath62 by @xmath78 and denote it as @xmath79 , we have @xmath80 independent of @xmath7 and @xmath77 .",
    "this is a very clear prediction of the combination models that can be tested by future experiments .    , scaled by @xmath81 , as a function of @xmath36 in the case that the flavor is globally compensated.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    one effect that might influence the flavor correlation factor @xmath82 in a system is the global flavor compensation . to make an estimation , we consider a system of equal number @xmath36 of quarks and anti - quarks and suppose the flavor is compensated globally .",
    "the expressions showing the influence are not difficult to derive but the results are a little bit lengthy .",
    "the simplest one is for @xmath83 , where we have , @xmath84/n_q(n_q-1)(n_q -2)p_s^3 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 . to get a feeling of the size of such effect , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : cbb ] the numeric results of @xmath86 for different types of baryons scaled by @xmath81 as a function of @xmath36 when global flavor compensation is taken into account .",
    "we see that there are indeed significant influences at not very large @xmath36 in particular for @xmath87 .",
    "the influences are small for large @xmath36 .",
    "usually , when we consider a sub - system of hadrons in a given kinematic region , this influence is expected to be small since the global flavor compensation only applies to the whole system produced in the collision .",
    "in summary , we study the baryon - anti - baryon flavor correlation in quark combination in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we adopt the formalism derived in @xcite by making the assumptions of flavor - momentum - factorization and independent flavor production at the quark level .",
    "we show that the observed universal behaviors of anti - baryon to baryon yield ratios as functions of that of @xmath0 to @xmath1 are naturally explained .",
    "we propose further measurements in this connection and make predictions for future experiments .",
