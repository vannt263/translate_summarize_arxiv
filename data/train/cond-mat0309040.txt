    "despite the prevalence of granular materials in nature and industry , a coherent understanding of granular flows is still lacking .",
    "particularly in dense systems , features such as jamming , shear bands , and the coexistence of solid- and liquid - like regions make it difficult to offer a simple theoretical description .",
    "fluctuations in both the force network and particle velocities can be of the same magnitude as the mean values and are known to be important aspects of the microscopic behavior of dense granular flows@xcite . due to the complexity of these systems ,",
    "one of the key goals of current research is to develop a statistical description of steady state behavior , such as a thermodynamic or hydrodynamic model .",
    "fundamental to statistical approaches is understanding the mean fluctuating part of particle motion , which is described by a granular diffusivity",
    ".    sheared granular systems have received considerable attention recently @xcite as an important example of granular flow .",
    "diffusion , in particular , has been studied in a variety of granular systems , such as vibrated grains @xcite , tumblers @xcite , chute flows @xcite , and sheared systems @xcite , but these studies have predominantly focused on rapid flow regimes . understanding slow , high density , flow is not trivial @xcite ; there is no replacement at the fundamental level for collisionally based kinetic theories that are expected to apply only in the dilute rapid flow regime .    in this paper , we characterize the self - diffusivity of grains in a 2d couette shearing experiment by studying individual particle trajectories over time .",
    "in contrast to most previous results , we focus on quasistatic dense flows . in this regime",
    ", since particles are constantly in contact with their neighbors , interactions are not collisional and material flow is largely confined to a shear band with a nominal thickness on the order of 5 particle diameters .",
    "several observations from the present experiments are noteworthy : 1 ) we find that particle diffusivity is proportional to the local shear rate , with diffusivities approximately twice as large along the mean flow direction as the perpendicular direction .",
    "2 ) we show that unlike rapid flows , the anisotropic force network induces a substantial anisotropy in the diffusivity .",
    "this is in addition to the usual anisotropy induced by the direction of mean flow .",
    "3 ) care must be taken when calculating diffusivities in a shear gradient @xcite , as motion can appear to be subdiffusive or superdiffusive due to a gradient in the shear rate or taylor dispersion @xcite .",
    "we show through a simple fokker - planck model that apparent sub- or super - diffusive behavior can be attributed to shear gradient and boundary effects .",
    "4 ) hence , the grain motion is statistically consistent with a simple random walk in the presence of shear gradients .",
    "5 ) nevertheless , at larger spatial scales , we occasionally observe correlated motion and lvy flights .",
    "but these events are rare and do not have a significant impact in the mean .      in the kinetic theory approach",
    ", a granular temperature is often defined as t @xmath4 @xmath5 , with instantaneous particle velocity @xmath6 and mean velocity @xmath7 , in which the velocity fluctuations contribute to a temperature in analogy with molecular gases .",
    "a different approach was recently proposed by makse and kurchan , who applied uniform shear in a numerical experiment and measured diffusivity @xmath0 and mobility @xmath8 to define a temperature @xmath9 by analogy with fluid systems @xcite . in their model",
    ", they report that the @xmath10 law ( thermal equilibration ) is satisfied in a bidisperse mixture , supporting the thermodynamic picture .",
    "this is in contrast to experimental measurements of kinetic granular temperature which find a lack of equipartition when different types of particles are present @xcite .",
    "isotropic brownian diffusion in an unbounded system is often characterized by the time evolution of the second moments of a probability distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "for example , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the particle position relative to its initial position ( @xmath13 for a small time step @xmath14 ) , @xmath0 is the diffusivity , and @xmath15 is time .",
    "more generally , diffusion must be described by a tensor .",
    "for instance , diffusivities along the flow direction in granular gases are in general different from transverse diffusivities @xcite .",
    "diffusion in even a simple shear flow is complicated by taylor dispersion effects @xcite , in which diffusive motion couples to the mean flow leading to larger dispersion along the flow direction , as recently elucidated in systems of noncolloidal particles @xcite . in this case",
    ", @xmath16 is nonlinear in time , i.e. it contains higher order corrections due to the coupling of the shear to the diffusive motion . simply subtracting the mean flow from particle trajectories and",
    "computing diffusivities does not give accurate results in this system @xcite .",
    "in particular , for flow of the form @xmath17 , i.e. uniform unbounded shear flow in two dimensions in which there is a constant shear rate @xmath1 creating a velocity gradient in the @xmath18 direction , the second order moments are given by @xcite : @xmath19 these equations describe an ensemble average of particle positions @xmath20 relative to the particle s initial location ( i.e. ( ( x(0 ) , y(0 ) ) = ( 0,0 ) ) , without subtracting the mean flow .",
    "these relations follow naturally for a pdf described by brownian anisotropic diffusion with mean local flow @xmath21 as above , and a diffusion tensor , @xmath22 , with elements @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 where    @xmath26    here , @xmath12 corresponds to the streamwise direction and @xmath18 is perpendicular to @xmath12 .",

    "these higher order terms contribute to mean squared displacements which therefore appear superdiffusive .",
    "it must be emphasized that equations  [ dyy - eqn]-[dxx - eqn ] are derived assuming that the diffusivities and shear rate are constant in space and time over an infinite plane .",
    "this condition is not met in the current experiment which changes the specific form of the correction terms .",
    "several issues concerning a diffusive picture must be addressed for sheared dense granular materials to determine whether brownian diffusion applies .",
    "two of these issues are the presence of a shear band and the limiting boundary at the shearing surface . even assuming that a diffusive description is applicable",
    ", it remains to be determined on what temporal or spatial scales such a description should apply . in dense quasistatic flows , grains are generally close to a jammed state in which particles are in constant contact .",
    "motion of grains requires the creation of voids , so correlated motion might be expected to be particularly important in dense 2d systems where paths are constrained .",
    "short - lived vortex structures have been seen in 2d granular simulations @xcite and experiments on 2d shearing of foams@xcite .",
    "these are potential deviations fom brownian diffusive behavior which might affect the time evolution of the moments .",

    "substantial work on granular diffusivity in rapid flows has been done by hsiau and coworkers who have measured self - diffusion coefficients in a variety of granular systems @xcite .",
    "they find that fluctuations are anisotropic , with the largest fluctuations along the flow .",
    "diffusivities are found to increase with shear rate and depend on the square root of the granular temperature t in agreement with kinetic gas theory .",

    "radjai and roux studied particle velocity fluctuations in numerical simulations under homogeneous strain in which there was no shear band formation @xcite .",
    "they measured anomalous diffusion with an exponent of 0.9 ( rather than 0.5 for ordinary diffusion ) which they attributed to long - time configurational memory of a granular medium in quasistatic flows .",
