    "@xmath4 , @xmath2 , @xmath5 ) , the study of their interaction with nucleons or with other mesons is at present not feasible in direct scattering experiments .",
    "one of the methods permitting such investigations is the production of a meson in the nucleon - nucleon interaction close to the kinematical threshold or in kinematics regions where the outgoing particles possess small relative velocities .",
    "a mutual interaction among the outgoing particles manifests itself in the distributions of differential cross sections as well as in the magnitude and energy dependence of the total reaction rate .    in the last decade",
    "major experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite efforts were concentrated on the study of the creation of @xmath6 , @xmath2 and @xmath5 mesons via the hadronic interactions  @xcite .",
    "measurements have been performed in the vicinity of the kinematical threshold where only a few partial waves in both initial and final state are expected to contribute to the production process .",
    "this simplifies significantly the interpretation of the data , yet still appears to be challenging due to the three particle final state system with a complex hadronic potential .",

    "preliminary results for the @xmath17 transition with the full treatment of the three - body effects are shown as a dashed - double - dotted line  @xcite .",

    "reveals that the proton - proton fsi enhances the total cross section by more than an order of magnitude for low excess energies .",
    "one recognizes also that in the case of the @xmath5 the data are described very well ( solid line ) assuming that the on - shell proton - proton amplitude exclusively determines the phase - space population .",
    "this indicates that the proton-@xmath5 interaction is too small to manifest itself in the excitation function within the presently achievable accuracy . in case of the @xmath2 meson",
    "the increase of the total cross section for very low and very high energies is much larger than expected from the @xmath9 final state interaction between protons  ( solid line ) , though for both the @xmath10 and @xmath18 reactions the dominance of the @xmath17 transition ] where , superscript `` i '' indicates the initial state quantities .",
    "s denotes the total spin of the nuleons , and j stands for the overall angular momentum of the system .",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the relative angular momentum of the nucleon  nucleon pair and of the meson relative to the @xmath21 system , respectively .",
    "the values of orbital angular momenta are commonly expressed using the spectroscopic notation ( l  =  s , p , d , ... , and l  =  s , p , d , ... ) . ]",
    "is expected up to an excess energy of about 40  mev and 100  mev , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the excess at higher energies can be assigned to the significant onset of higher partial waves , and the influence of the attractive interaction between the @xmath2 meson and the proton could be a plausible explanation for the enhancement at threshold . a similar effect close to threshold is also observed in the photoproduction of @xmath2 via the @xmath22 reaction  @xcite indicating to some extent that the phenomenon is independent of the production process but rather related to the interaction among the @xmath2 meson and nucleons in the s@xmath23(1535 ) resonance region .",
    "indeed , a simple phenomenological treatment  @xcite   based on factorization of the transition amplitude into the constant primary production and the on - shell incoherent pairwise interaction among outgoing particles   describes very well the enhancement close to the threshold  ( dotted line ) .",
    "however , this approach fails for the description of the invariant mass distribution of the proton - proton and proton-@xmath2 subsystems determined recently at q  =  15  mev by the cosy - tof collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the structure of this invariant mass distributions , which we confirm in this paper utilizing a fully different experimental method , may indicate a non - negligible contribution from the p - waves in the outgoing proton - proton subsystem  @xcite .",
    "these can be produced for instance via @xmath15 or @xmath16 transitions .",
    "this hypothesis encounters , however , difficulties in describing the excess energy dependence of the total cross section .",
    "the amount of the p - wave admixture derived from the proton - proton invariant mass distribution leads to a good description of the excitation function at higher excess energies while at the same time it spoils significanly the agreement with the data at low values of q , as depicted by the dashed - dotted line in figure  [ cross_eta_etap ] .",
    "however , these difficulties in reproducing the observed energy dependence might be due to the particular model used in reference  @xcite , and thus higher partial wave contributions can not a priori be excluded .",
    "in contrast to the p - wave contribution the three - body treatment  @xcite of the @xmath3 system  ( dashed - double - dotted line ) leads to an even larger enhancement of the cross section near threshold than that based on the ansatz of the factorization of the proton - proton and proton-@xmath2 interactions .",
    "it must be kept in mind however that a too strong fsi effect predicted by the three - body model must be partially assigned to the neglect of the coulomb repulsion in this preliminary calculations  @xcite .",
    "these illustrate that the simple phenomenological approach shown by the dotted line could fortuitously lead to the proper result , due to a mutual cancelation of the effects caused by the approximations assumed in calculations and the neglect of higher partial waves .",
    "this issue will be discussed further in section  [ interpretation ] after the presentation of the new cosy-11 data .",
    "the above considerations show unambiguously that for the complete understanding of the low energy @xmath3 dynamics , in addition to the already established excitation function of the total cross section , a determination of the differential observables is also necessary .",
    "these will help to disentangle effects caused by the proton-@xmath2 interaction and the contributions from higher partial waves . in this article we present distributions determined experimentally for two sets of orthogonal variables fully describing the pp@xmath2 system , which was produced at an excess energy of q  =  15.5  mev via the @xmath10 reaction using the cosy-11  @xcite facility at cosy  @xcite .",
    "for the full description of the three particle system five independent variables are required . in the center  of  mass frame , due to the momentum conservation , the momentum vectors of the particles are lying in one plane often referred to as the emission , reaction or decay plane . in this plane  ( depicted in figure  [ figvariables ] ) a relative movement of the particles can be described by two variables only .",
    "the square of the invariant masses of the di - proton and proton-@xmath2 system denoted as @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , constitute a natural choice for the study of the interaction within the pp@xmath2 system .",
    "this is because in the case of non - interacting objects the surface spanned by these variables is homogenously populated .",
    "the interaction among the particles modifies that occupation density and in consequence facilitates an easy qualitative interpretation of the experimental results .",
    "the remaining three variables must define an absolute orientation of the emission plane in the distinguished coordinate system .",
    "this may be realized for example by defining the orientation for the momentum of the arbitrarily chosen particle in the center  of  mass frame and the angle which describes the rotation around the direction fixed by that particle . in one of our choices made following reference  @xcite",
    "the corresponding variables are the polar and the azimuthal angle of the @xmath2 momentum vector , depicted in figure  [ figvariables ] as @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , and the angle @xmath28 describing the rotation around the direction established by the momentum of the @xmath2 meson .",
    "figure  [ figvariables ] demonstrates that such rotation neither affects the @xmath2 meson momentum nor changes the configuration of the momenta in the emission plane . in the case of experiments with unpolarized beams and",
    "targets the only favoured direction is that of the beam line .",
    "therefore , as a zero value of the @xmath28 angle we have chosen the projection of the beam direction on the plane perpendicular to the momentum vector of the @xmath2 meson .",
    "note that we identify the z - axis with the beam direction .",
    "the @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 variables can also be interpreted as euler angles allowing for the rotation of the emission plane into a xz - plane .    as a second possibility we will describe an orientation of the emission plane by the azimuthal- and polar angle of the vector normal to that plane  @xcite .",
    "these angles are shown in figure  [ figvariables ] as @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "further the absolute orientation of the particles momenta in the emission plane will be described by @xmath31 , the angle between @xmath2 meson and the vector product of the beam momentum and the vector @xmath32 .",
    "obviously , the interaction between the particles does not depend on the orientation of the emission plane , and therefore , it will fully manifest itself in the occupation density of the dalitz plot which in our case will be represented in terms of the square of the invariant masses of the two particle subsystems .",
    "the distribution of the orientation of the emission plane will reflect , however , the correlation between the intial and final channel and hence its determination should be helpful for the investigation of the production mechanism .",
    "using the cosy-11 detection system  @xcite , utilizing a stochastically cooled proton beam of the cooler synchrotron cosy  @xcite and a hydrogen cluster target  @xcite , we have performed a high statistics measurement of the @xmath33 reaction at a nominal beam momentum of 2.027  gev / c .",
    "the experiment was based on the four - momentum registration of both outgoing protons , whereas the @xmath2 meson was identified via the missing mass technique .",
    "the positively charged particles have been identified combining the time of flight between the s1 and s3 scintillation detectors and the momentum reconstructed by tracking trajectories registered by means of the drift chambers back to the target .",
    "the detection setup is sketched in figure  [ detector ] .",
    "the accuracy of the missing mass reconstruction depends on two parameters : the spread of the beam momentum as well as the precision of the measured momenta of the outgoing protons .",
    "the latter is predominantly due to the geometrical spread of the beam . since for the reconstruction of the momenta we assume that the reaction takes place in the middle of the target we can not correct on an event - by - event basis for the momentary spread of the beam .",
    "however , we can rectify the smearing due to the shifts of the centre of the beam relative to the target as well as the average changes of the absolute beam momentum during the experiment .",
    "therefore , after the selection of events with two registered protons , as a first step of the more refined analysis the data were corrected for the mean beam momentum changes ( see fig .",
    "[ delta_pb ] ) determined from the measured schottky frequency spectra and the known beam optics .    in a next step , from the distributions of the elastically scattered protons , the schottky frequency spectrum , and the missing mass distribution of the @xmath34 reaction , we have estimated that the spread of the beam momentum , and the spread of the reaction points in horizontal and vertical direction amount to @xmath35  mev / c , @xmath36  cm , and @xmath37  cm , respectively .",
    "details of this procedure can be found in references  @xcite .",
    "further on , a comparison of the experimentally determined momentum spectra of the elastically scattered protons with the distributions simulated with different beam and target conditions allows us to established the position at which the centre of the beam crosses the target with an accuracy of 0.25  mm  @xcite .",
    "accounting for the movement of the beam relative to the target we improved the missing mass resolution as demonstrated in figure  [ miss_all ] .",
    "after this betterment , the peak originating from the @xmath10 reaction became more symmetric and the signal to background ratio increased significantly .",
    "the background was simulated taking into account @xmath38 reactions with @xmath39 and  @xmath40 .",
    "since we consider here only the very edge of the phase space distribution where the protons are produced predominantly in the s - wave the shape of the background can be reproduced assuming that the homogenous phase space distribution is modified only by the interaction between protons . indeed , as can be observed in figure  [ missall ]",
    "the simulation describes the data very well .",
    "the calculated spectrum is hardly distinguishable from the experimental points .",
    "the position of the peak on the missing mass spectrum and the known mass of the @xmath2 meson  @xcite enabled to determine the actual absolute beam momentum to be @xmath41  gev / c  @xmath42  0.0013  gev / c , which agrees within error limits with the nominal value of @xmath43  gev / c .",
    "the real beam momentum corresponds to the excess energy of the pp@xmath2 system equal to q  =  15.5  @xmath42  0.4  mev .      as already mentioned in the previous section at the cosy-11 facility the identification of the @xmath44 reaction",
    "is based on the measurement of the momentum vectors of the outgoing protons and the utilisation of the missing mass technique .",
    "inaccuracy of the momentum determination manifests itself in the population of kinematically forbidden regions of the phase space , preventing a precise comparison of the theoretically derived and experimentally determined differential cross sections .",
    "figure  [ dalitzsym ] visualizes this effect and clearly demonstrates that the data scatter significantly outside the kinematically allowed region  ( solid line ) , in spite of the fact that the precision of the fractional momentum determination in the laboratory system ( @xmath45 ) is quite high .    therefore , when seeking for small effects like for example the influence of the proton-@xmath2 interaction on the population density of the phase - space , one needs either to fold theoretical calculations with the experimental resolution , or to perform the kinematical fitting of the data .",
    "both procedures require the knowledge of the covariance matrix , and thus its determination constitutes a necessary step in the differential analysis and interpretation of the data .    in order to derive the covariance matrix we need to recognize and quantify all possible sources of errors in the reconstruction of the two proton momenta @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the four dominant effects are : i ) finite distributions of the beam momentum and of the reaction points , ii ) multiple scattering in the dipole chamber exit foil , air , and detectors , iii ) finite resolution of the position determination of the drift chambers , and iv ) a possible inadequate assignment of hits to the particle tracks in drift chambers in the case of very close tracks .",
    "some of these , like the multiple scattering , depend on the outgoing protons momenta , others , like the beam momentum distribution , depend on the specific run conditions and therefore must be determined for each run separately .    in order to estimate the variances and covariances for all possible combinations of the momentum components of two registered protons we have generated @xmath48 @xmath10 events and simulated the response of the cosy-11 detection setup taking into account the above listed factors and the known resolutions of the detector components .",
    "next , we analysed the signals by means of the same reconstruction procedure as used in case of the experimental data .",
    "covariances between the @xmath49 and the @xmath50 components of the event vector @xmath51 \\right)}}$ ] were established as the average of the product of the deviations between the reconstruced and generated values .",
    "the explicit formula for the sample of @xmath52 reconstructed events reads :    @xmath53    where @xmath54 and @xmath55 denote the generated and reconstructed values for the @xmath49 component of the vector @xmath56 describing the @xmath57 event .    because of the inherent symmetries of the covariance matrix @xmath58 and the indistinguishability of the registered protons  ) implies that cov(i , j )  =  cov(i@xmath423,j@xmath423 ) , where the + has to be taken for i , j  =  1,2,3 and the - for i , j  =  4,5,6 .",
    "thus for example cov(2,4 )  =  cov(5,1 ) .",
    "] there are only 12 independent values which determine the @xmath59 error matrix @xmath60 unambiguously .    since inaccuracies of the momentum determination depend on the particle momentum itself ( eg .  multiple scattering ) and on the relative momentum between protons ( eg .",
    "trajectories reconstruction from signals in drift chambers ) , we have determined the covariance matrices as a function of the absolute momentum of both protons : @xmath61 .    as an example we present the covariance matrix for the mean values of @xmath62 and @xmath63 in units of mev@xmath64/c@xmath64 , as established in the laboratory system with the @xmath65-coordinate parallel to the beam axis and @xmath66-coordinate corresponding to the vertical direction .    @xmath67   \\begin{array}{c }        p_{1x } \\ \\\\\\",
    "p_{1y}\\\\        p_{1z}\\\\        p_{2x}\\\\        p_{2y}\\\\        p_{2z }   \\end{array }   \\end{array}\\ ] ]    since the measurements have been performed close to the kinematical threshold the ejectile momentum component parallel to the beam is by far the largest one and its variance ( @xmath68 ) determines in first order the error of the momentum measurement .",
    "the second largest contribution stems from an anti - correlation between the @xmath69 and @xmath70 momentum components ( @xmath71 ) , which is due to the bending of the proton trajectory   mainly in the horizontal direction   inside the cosy-11 dipole magnet  ( see fig .  [ detector ] ) .",
    "there is also a significant correlation between the @xmath65 components of different protons which is due to the smearing of the reaction points , namely , if in the analysis the assumed reaction point differs from the actual one , a mistake made in the reconstruction affects both protons similarly .",
    "figure  [ covariance ] depicts the variation of @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 over the momentum plane ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) . taking into account components of the covariance matrices v(@xmath62 , @xmath63 ) and the distribution of the proton momenta for the @xmath75 reaction at q  =  15.5  mev results in an average error for the measurement of the proton momentum of about 6  mev / c .",
    "this can be also deduced from the distribution of the difference between the generated and reconstructed absolute momenta of the protons .",
    "the corresponding spectrum is plotted as a dashed line in figure  [ deltafit ] .    in the experiment",
    "we have measured 6 variables and once we assume that the event corresponds to the @xmath10 reaction only 5 of them are independent .",
    "thus we have varied the values of the event components demanding that the missing mass is equal to the mass of the @xmath2 meson and we have chosen that vector which was the closest to the experimental one .",
    "the inverse of the covariance matrix was used as a metric for the distance calculation .",
    "the kinematical fit improves the resolution by a factor of about 1.5 as can be concluded from comparing the dashed- and solid lines in figure  [ deltafit ] .",
    "the finally resulting error of the momentum determination amounts to 4  mev / c .",
    "+   +    at the excess energy of q  =  15.5  mev the cosy-11 detection system does not cover the full 4@xmath76 solid angle in the centre - of - mass system of the @xmath10 reaction . therefore , the detailed study of differential cross sections requires corrections for the acceptance . generally , the acceptance should be expressed as a function of the full set of mutually orthogonal variables which describe the studied reaction unambiguously . as introduced in section  [ choiceofobservables ] , to define the relative movement of the particles in the reaction plane we have chosen two squares of the invariant masses : @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and to define the orientation of this plane in the center - of - mass frame we have taken the three euler angles : the first two are simply the polar @xmath77 and azimuthal @xmath78 angles of the momentum of the @xmath2 meson and the third angle @xmath28 describes the rotation of the reaction plane around the axis defined by the momentum vector of the @xmath2 meson . in the data evaluation we considerably benefit from the basic geometrical symmetries satisfied by the @xmath10 reaction .",
    "due to the axial symmetry of the initial channel of the two unpolarized colliding protons the event distribution over @xmath77 must be isotropic .",
    "thus , we can safely integrate over @xmath79 , ignoring that variable in the analysis .",
    "furthermore , taking advantage of the symmetry due to the two identical particles in the initial channel , without losing the generality , we can express the acceptance as a function of @xmath24,@xmath25,@xmath80 , and @xmath28 . to facilitate the calculations we have divided the range of @xmath80 and @xmath28 into 10 bins and both @xmath24 and @xmath25 into 40 bins each . in the case of the @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    "the choice was made such that the width of the interval corresponds to the standard deviation of the experimental accuracy . for @xmath80 and @xmath28",
    "we have taken only ten partitions since from the previous experiments we expect only a small variation of the cross section over these variables  @xcite . in this representation , however , the cosy-11 detection system covers only 50% of the phase - space for the @xmath10 reaction at q  =  15.5  mev . to proceed with the analysis we assumed that the distribution over the angle @xmath28 is isotropic as it was for example experimentally determined for the @xmath81 , @xmath82 , or @xmath83 reactions  @xcite .",
    "please note that this is the only assumption of the reaction dynamics performed in the present evaluation .",
    "the validity of this supposition in the case of the @xmath10 reaction will be discussed later .    in the calculations we exploit also",
    "the symmetry of the cross sections under the exchange of the two identical particles in the final state which reads : @xmath84 .",
    "the resultant acceptance is shown in figure  [ acceptanceijk ] .",
    "one recognizes that only a small part ( 3% ) of the phase - space is not covered by the detection system . in further calculations these holes",
    "were corrected according to the assumption of a homogeneous phase space distribution .",
    "additionally it was checked that the corrections under other suppositions eg . regarding",
    "also the proton - proton fsi leads to negligible differences .",
    "full points in figure  [ rozkladthetaeta ] present the distribution of the polar angle of the @xmath2 meson as derived from the data after the acceptance correction . within the statistical accuracy it is isotropic .",
    "taking into account this angular distribution of the cross section we can calculate the acceptance as a function of @xmath24 and @xmath25 only .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ acceptanceij ] , where one sees that now the full phase space is covered .",
    "this allows us to determine the distributions of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the correctness of the performed procedures for the simulation of the detectors response , the event reconstruction programs , the kinematical fitting and acceptance correction can be confirmed by comparing the distribution generated ( figure  [ dalitzporownanie]a ) with the ones which underwent the complete analysis chain described in this section ( figure  [ dalitzporownanie]b ) .",
    "knowing the distribution of the polar angle of the @xmath2 meson @xmath78 and those for the invariant masses @xmath24 and @xmath25 we can check whether the assumption of the isotropy of the cross section distribution versus the third euler s angle @xmath28 is corroborated by the data . for that purpose",
    "we calculated the acceptance as a function of @xmath28 and @xmath25 assuming the shape of the differential cross sections of @xmath85 and @xmath86 as determined experimentally .",
    "the obtained @xmath87 distribution is shown in figure  [ rozkladpsi1 ] and is not isotropic as assumed at the beginning .",
    "a fit of the function of the form @xmath88 gives the value of b  =  0.079  @xmath42  0.014  @xmath89 , indeed significantly different from the isotropic solution .",
    "this deviation can not be assigned to any unknown behaviour of the background since the obtained distribution can be regarded as background free .",
    "this is because the number of @xmath10 events was elaborated for each invariant mass interval separately .",
    "the exemplarily missing mass spectra for the first , fourth , seventh and tenth interval of @xmath28 values , corrected for the acceptance are presented in figure  [ misspsi ] .    from this figure",
    "one can infer that the shape of the background is well reproduced not only for the overall missing mass spectrum as shown previously in figure  [ missall ] but also locally in each region of the phase space . since the experimental data are quite well described by the simulations we can rather exclude the possibility of a significant systematical error which could cause the observed anisotropy of the differential cross section @xmath87 .",
    "the evaluated distribution is however in disagreement with our working assumption that the @xmath90 is isotropic .",
    "therefore we performed a full acceptance correction procedure from the very beginning assuming that the distribution of @xmath87 is as determined from the data .",
    "after repeating the procedure three times we observed that the input and resultant distributions are in good agreement .",
    "the result after the third iteration is shown in figure  [ rozkladpsi ] by the full circles .",
    "it is only slightly different from the one obtained after the first iteration as shown in figure  [ rozkladpsi1 ] . to rise the confidence of the convergence of the performed iteration we accomplished the full procedure once more , but now assuming that the distribution of @xmath87 is much more anisotropic than determined from the data . as an entry distribution we took the dashed line shown in figure  [ rozkladpsi ] .",
    "again after two iterations we have got the same result as before . finally determined values for @xmath91 are given in table  [ tablepsi ] .",
    ".[tablepsi ] differential cross section in the @xmath28 angle for the @xmath10 reaction at q  =  15.5  mev .",
    "fitting to the data a function of the form @xmath92 resulted in @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "figure  [ rozkladpsi ] illustrates the result .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ , > \" , ]     interestingly , the enhancement at large @xmath24 is visible also at much lower excess energy .",
    "this can be concluded from figure  [ figurejurek ] in which the cosy-11 data at q  @xmath95  4.5  mev  @xcite are compared to the simulations based on the assumption that the phase - space abundance is due to the proton - proton fsi only .",
    "this observation could imply that the effect is caused by the proton-@xmath2 interaction rather than higher partial waves , since their contribution at such small energies is quite improbable  @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in the lower part of figure  [ petaspp_kanzo ] the rigorous three - body treatment of the @xmath3 system leads at large values of @xmath24 to the reduction of the cross section in comparison to the calculation taking into account only first order rescattering ( pp+p@xmath2 )  @xcite . here",
    ", both calculations include only the @xmath17 transition .",
    "though the presented curves are still preliminary , we can qualitatively assess that the rigorous three - body approach , in comparison to the present estimations , will on the one hand enhance the total cross section near threshold as shown in figure  [ cross_eta_etap ] , while on the other hand it will decrease the differential cross section at large values of @xmath24 .",
    "this is just opposite to the influence of p - waves in the proton - proton system .    from the above presented considerations it is rather obvious that the rigorous three - body treatment of the produced @xmath3 system and the exact determination of the contributions from the higher partial waves may result in the simultaneous explanation of both observations : the near - threshold enhancement of the excitation function of the total cross section , and the strong increase of the invariant mass distribution at large values of @xmath24 .",
    "for the unambiguous determination of the contributions from different partial waves spin dependent observables are required  @xcite .",
    "the first attempt has been already reported in  @xcite .",
    "using the stochastically cooled proton beam at the cooler synchrotron cosy and the cosy-11 facility we have determined the total and differential cross sections for the @xmath10 reaction at an excess energy of q  =  15.5  mev .",
    "the high statistics data sample allowed us for the clear separation of events corresponding to the @xmath10 reaction from the multi - pion production at each investigated phase - space bin , and the multidimensional acceptance correction allowed to extract the result without necessity of any assumption about the reaction process .",
    "the determined distributions of the centre - of - mass polar angle of the @xmath2 meson emission as well as the distribution of the relative proton - proton momentum with respect to the momentum of the @xmath2 meson are consistent with isotropy .",
    "though , in the latter a small tendency of an increase of the cross section at 90 degree is observed . in contrary a rather strong decrease of the cross section",
    "was found at 90 degree for the center - of - mass polar angle of the vector normal to the emission plane .",
    "explanation of that effect may reveal an interesting characteristic of the dynamics of the production process .",
    "the determined invariant mass spectra of the two - particle subsystems deviate strongly from the predictions based on the homogenous population of events over the phase space .",
    "deviations at low proton - proton invariant mass values can be well explained as an influence of the s - wave interaction between the two protons .",
    "however , an unexpectedly large enhancement of the occupation density in the kinematical regions of low @xmath2-proton relative momentum is not yet understood .",
    "we have demonstrated that for the simultaneous description of the excitation function and invariant mass distributions a rigorous three - body calculation with inclusion of the contribution from higher partial waves is needed .",
