    "the radiative transport equation ( rte ) is an integro - differential equation which is widely used as a mathematical model of the flow of particles traveling through a medium which absorbs and scatters the particles @xcite .",

    "the coefficient @xmath18 denotes the speed of particles at position @xmath3 , @xmath19 the absorption coefficient , and @xmath20 the scattering coefficient .",
    "the integral kernel @xmath21 is called the scattering phase function and expresses the density of the conditional probability of the event that a particle moving in the direction @xmath22 is scattered into the direction @xmath1 at position @xmath3 .",
    "the inhomogeneous term @xmath23 is the density of internal source of particles emitted in the direction @xmath24 at time @xmath2 and position @xmath3 .",
    "an application of the rte of the form can be found in researches on diffuse optical tomography ( dot ) , which is expected to be a new modality of noninvasive medical imaging which uses low - energy light @xcite .",
    "the propagation of light in the biological tissue under examination is modeled by equation whose coefficients are unknown quantities to be determined by dot .",
    "the coefficients represent optical properties of the biological tissue , and they actually depend not only on position @xmath3 but also on time @xmath2 .",
    "however , the speed of light is so faster than time scale of tissue activity that we neglect their dependence on @xmath2 .",
    "the procedure of imaging by dot is regarded as an inverse problem of recovering the unknown coefficients by observing the solution @xmath4 at the boundary of the domain .",
