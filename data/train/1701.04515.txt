    "recently , many efforts have been devoted to the search of high - efficiency thermoelectric ( te ) materials , because of the high demand of energy - saving solid state coolers and power generators.@xmath6 te devices have very good potential for green energy applications due to their desirable features , including low air pollution , low noise , and long operation time .",
    "however , there exists certain barrier for te devices to replace conventional refrigerators and power generators since te materials with figure of merit ( @xmath0 ) larger than three are not yet found.@xmath6 the figure of merit , @xmath7,defined in the linear response regime is composed of the seebeck coefficient ( @xmath4 ) , electrical conductance ( @xmath2 ) , thermal conductance ( @xmath8 ) and equilibrium temperature ( @xmath9 ) .",

    "recently , there are considerable interest on @xmath0 values of nanowires filled with qds,@xmath6 because it is expected that @xmath5 can be reduced significantly due to the introduction of qds . such a reduction of @xmath5 due to phonon scattering with qds in sige nanowire filled with qds was verified theoretically in ref .",
    "however , the behaviors of @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 in nanowires filled with qds remain unclear because of the complicated many - body problem involved .",
    "the full many - body effect on the behaviors of electron thermoelectric coefficients may be analyzed by considering a single qd or double qds ( dqd ) embedded in a single nanowire to reveal the importance of the electron coulomb interaction .",
    "theoretical studies have indicated that a te device made of molecular qd junction@xmath21 can reach the carnot efficiency if one can neglect @xmath5 .",

    "if the qd energy levels are well described by the effective - mass model ( neglecting the crystal - field effect ) , then the orbital degeneracy is determined by the associated orbital angular momentum quantum number @xmath29 , and the level degeneracy becomes @xmath30 .",

    "@xmath258 and @xmath259 denote the intradot and interdot coulomb interactions . when all correlation functions of dqds are included as in refs .",

    "( [ tf ] ) allows us to obtain an analytic form of thermoelectric coefficients , which is very useful for clarifying how thermoelectric coefficients are influenced by tunneling rates , inter - dot hopping strength , and electron coulomb interactions .",

    "( 21 ) and ( 22 ) ) near maximum @xmath0 . as a consequence",
    ", the trend of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath268 is determined by that of @xmath2 for @xmath25 .",
    "next we consider the case with two - fold degenerate levels ( @xmath269 ) for each qd in the dqd junction .",
    "such two - fold degeneracy can be realized in qds with suitable symmetry .",
    "for example , the @xmath270- and @xmath271-like states in a disk - shaped qd are degenerate . due to symmetry , the intradot electron hopping process is prohibited , whereas the interdot electron hopping strength is nonzero .",
    "we assume @xmath272 , the same as that of the @xmath147 case .",
    "the intradot coulomb interactions are taken to be @xmath273 , where @xmath274 denote the two degenerate levels within the same qd .",
    "the interdot coulomb interaction is taken as @xmath275 .",
    "the calculation of thermoelectric coefficients of dqd with @xmath269 involves solving one- , two- , @xmath89 , up to eight - particle green functions . due to the presence of @xmath268 term ,",
    "the numerical procedure is much more complicated than that of a single qd with @xmath88 .",
    "based on eqs .",
    "( 4)-(6 ) , we calculate the thermoelectrical coefficients of dod for the @xmath269 as functions of the qd energy level as shown in fig .",
    "the first four resonant channels of @xmath2 ( on the left hand side of mdcg ) are approximately given by @xmath276 , @xmath277 , @xmath278 , and @xmath279 , in which the small @xmath268 is neglected since @xmath280 . the oscillatory behavior of @xmath2 displayed in fig .",
    "7(a ) is similar to the @xmath2 spectra observed experimentally in tunneling current measurements of pbse qd ( which has a six - fold degenerate excited state ) and carbon nanotube qd ( which has an eight - fold state).@xmath281 although the @xmath4 spectrum exhibits more bipolar oscillatory structures , the maximum @xmath4 value does not increase with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "this feature is the same as that of a single qd case .",
    "7(d ) shows an large enhancement of maximum @xmath0 arising from the degeneracy effect . in the current case",

    "we expect even larger enhancement to occur for higher level degeneracy .",
    "unfortunately , the computation effort for @xmath283 for a dqd junction is prohibitively large if all green functions and correlations functions are to be included .    to clarify the behavior of @xmath282 in the level - depletion regime ( with @xmath284 ) , we can approximately write ( by keeping only the dominant channel ) @xmath285 where @xmath187 is the probability weight for dqd in the level - depletion regime . under the assumption of @xmath286 and @xmath287",

    "6(b ) and l - dependent @xmath282 determined by @xmath2 in fig .",
    "note that if we artificially set @xmath292 ( i.e. neglecting @xmath5 ) , one can prove that the enhancement of @xmath282 arising from @xmath1 will disappear due to the @xmath1-independence of the ratio @xmath22 and @xmath1-independence of @xmath4 . if we choose a much higher value of @xmath142 ( e.g. @xmath293 ) in eq .",
    "( 14 ) , we will have the condition @xmath294 .",
    "in this situation , @xmath1 dependence of @xmath282 is fully determined by @xmath2 and we have @xmath0 linearly proportional to @xmath1 , since @xmath187 in eq .  ( 18 ) is close to 1 under the condition @xmath295 , and the @xmath0 values will be approximately proportional to @xmath296 .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that qd junctions embedded in a silicon nanowire can be realized by the advanced technique reported in refs .",
    "45 and 46 .",
    "we have theoretically investigated the effects of level degeneracy on thermoelectric properties of qds embedded in a thin nanowire junction in the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "all the correlation functions arising from electron coulomb interactions for electrons in the degenerate levels are included in our calculation .",
    "we found that the maximum values of @xmath0 can be highly enhanced with level degeneracy under the typical condition with @xmath5 much larger than @xmath3 . when @xmath297 , @xmath4 is independent on @xmath1",
    ". therefore , the enhancement of @xmath282 in the level - depletion regime is mainly attributed to the increase of @xmath2 . large enhancement of @xmath0 due to the increase of level degeneracy is also found in the presence of finite electron hopping in coupled qd system . in our studies , we assumed a simple expression @xmath298 for the phonon thermal conductance .",
    "however , it is worth pointing out that our conclusion on the effect of level degeneracy on @xmath0 is not limited to the linear @xmath9-behavior of @xmath5 ( as illustrated in fig .",
    "the enhancement due to level degeneracy holds as long as @xmath299 , regardless of the temperature dependance of @xmath5 .",
