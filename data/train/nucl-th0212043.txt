    "analyticity is numerically the hardest problem to keep track of in a scattering problem .",
    "both the singularities from on - shell states , which yield imaginary parts and the effects of thresholds require careful analysis .",
    "this is one of the main hurdles for the development of unitary models for coupled - channel scattering .    in this short paper",
    "a set of consistent approximations that yield unitary and analytical results for coupled channel problems is described .",
    "it is accompanied by the open source program bubblegum , which yield numerical @xmath0-matrix results , together with the corresponding @xmath2-matrix approximation , @xcite breit - wigner approximation , @xcite and the perturbative results .",
    "the general purpose of both the paper and the computer program is threefold .",
    "first , to show that approximations that violate unitarity or analyticity will generally deviate considerably @xcite from exact results in the case of strong interactions and thresholds close to resonance values .",
    "second , to show that the exact results can be derived straightforwardly with a reasonable effort , in a manner that can improved be systematically .",
    "third , to show that scattering data do not only contain pole information of the resonances but also the non - perturbative matrix elements between asymptotic , or scattering states , and resonances .",
    "extraction of these matrix elements from the scattering data might lead to better constraints on models for hadrons .",
    "furthermore , substantial energy shifts occur through coupling of resonances with asymptotic states , or decay channels , which can only be analyzed in a fully analytic approach .",
    "since hadrons are composite particles , they have form factors that suppress high - energy processes .",
    "these form factors and the energy shifts are related and should be treated consistently , which neither the @xmath2-matrix approach nor the breit - wigner approximation can do .",
    "depending on the large energy behavior of the form factor , the shift can vary substantially . in the case of suppression at high energy , the shift will change sign as scattering energy increases , from negative to positive .",
    "it is common folkore that bare masses have no meaning .",
    "it stems from renormalizable field theory , where indeed masses can undergo abritrary shifts through finite renormalization .",
    "however , in hadron theory constituent quark models and other hadronic models yield the bare states with the bare masses and their couplings to the decay channels . in this case a comparison between scattering data and these models should incorporate the energy shifts through the non - perturbative coupling of bare states and decay channels .",
    "the simplest process contributing to @xmath6-channel scattering is the tree diagram , where the two - particle state @xmath7 , in a particular partial wave , forms a resonance state @xmath8 which decays into a two - particle state @xmath9 .",
    "the transition amplitude is given by : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the coupling constants , @xmath13 is the phase space for each state , @xmath14 the form factors , @xmath15 the mass of the state @xmath8 , and @xmath16 the scattering energy .",
    "this lowest order diagram is a poor approximation @xcite to the actual scattering process , especially for hadron dynamics .",
    "first , the coupling constant is large , therefore , during scattering , the initial state @xmath7 goes , on average , through several intermediate states , before ending up in the final state @xmath9 .",
    "second , for scattering energies @xmath16 close to the resonance mass @xmath17 , the interaction is strong due to the small energy denominators , even if the coupling is small .",
    "hence , the simple tree diagram , which corresponds to the lowest order perturbative expansion , fails here .",
    "if the problem would be solved consistently , the resonance will acquire a width , which corresponds to the shift of the pole into the complex plane .    solving",
    "the scattering problem consistently means iterating the elementary scattering processes such that it reaches a fixed point .",
    "there are many more or less equivalent ways to find the self - consistent solution . in this paper",
    "we will use the lipmann - schwinger equation @xcite : @xmath18 which can be written down in many other forms . in practice",
    ", this equation determines the transition amplitude @xmath0 , which is the sum over all possible processes , with different numbers of intermediate states .    for the case of two coupled channels",
    "the matrix lipmann - schwinger equation will look like : @xmath19 where @xmath20",
    "the reduced transition amplitudes @xmath21 are defined as : @xmath22 with the states @xmath23 given by : @xmath24 @xmath25 is the asymptotic state @xmath9 with energy @xmath16 .    the solution for this case of two coupled channels can still be given in a simple closed form : @xmath26 } { \\cal w}_2 } { 1 - x_{11 } { \\cal w}_1 - x_{22 } { \\cal w}_2 + { \\rm det[x ] } { \\cal w}_1 { \\cal w}_2 } \\ \\ ,   \\label{t11}\\\\ t_{22 } & = & \\frac{x_{22 } - { \\rm det[x ] } { \\cal w}_1 } { 1 - x_{11 } { \\cal w}_1 - x_{22 } { \\cal w}_2 + { \\rm det[x ] } { \\cal w}_1 { \\cal w}_2 } \\ \\ ,   \\label{t22}\\\\ t_{12 } & = &   \\frac{x_{12}}{1 - x_{11 } { \\cal w}_1 - x_{22 } { \\cal w}_2 + { \\rm det[x]}{\\cal w}_1   { \\cal w}_2 } \\ \\ , \\label{t12 } \\\\ t_{21 } & = & \\frac{x_{21}}{1 - x_{11 } { \\cal w}_1 - x_{22 } { \\cal w}_2 + { \\rm det[x ] } { \\cal w}_1 { \\cal w}_2 } \\ \\ , \\label{t21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is defined as : @xmath28 , and the functions @xmath29 are defined through the following integrals : @xmath30 where pv stands for a principal value integral , and the asymptotic states are orthonormal : @xmath31 .",
    "it is clear that these results can easily be extended to incorporate an arbitrary number of channels .",
    "both @xmath32 and @xmath33 are real ; any phase information is to be incorporated in the coupling constants . in the absence of a form factor @xmath33 the second integral",
    "generally does not converge .",
    "it requires regularization , and possibly a motivation for this regularization through renormalization .",
    "subtracted dispersion integrals effectively correspond to regularization through local subtractions .",
    "another option is to set @xmath34 to zero , and only use the phase space for the imaginary part , which is known as the @xmath2-matrix method .    for a general case the dispersion integral eq .",
    "( [ eqwt ] ) can not be solved analytically . however , since the form factor is rather arbitrary , it can be chosen such that @xmath35 has a known solution for the dispersion integral . an expansion in a set of these functions ,",
    "allows one to determine @xmath36 as part of the analysis of scattering data of resonances .",
    "this quantity can , and should , be compared to models of hadrons since the function @xmath37 where @xmath17 is the bare resonance state .",
    "the transition matrix element is expected to fall - off at higher energies , due to the composite nature of hadrons .",
    "another constraint on @xmath38 is given by general covariance , which requires that @xmath38 is analytic in @xmath39 with all the cuts on the real axis associated with decay channels , or asymptotic states . in feynman perturbation theory covariance",
    "is the result of summing the different time - ordered diagrams . in the language of states , these different time orderings correspond to different states , which often correspond to decay channels that will be of little significance in the kinematical region of interest .",
    "however , as restoring covariance comes at little cost , we replace the energy dispersion relation with : @xmath40 would yield generally a small difference in @xmath34 .",
    "this , however , includes the second time ordering and restores analyticity in @xmath6 , which is a consequence of full covariance .",
    "moreover , analyticity in @xmath6 implies a restriction on possible approximations for @xmath41 , _",
    "i.e. _ , there should not be a cut at @xmath42 .",
    "in @xmath38 itself the second time ordering is not included , as it would correspond to a different decay state which is generally of little consequence , however , would yield additional singularities to keep track of .",
    "this feature of manifest relativistic invariant formulation makes the evaluation of higher order feynman diagrams in minkowski space complicated .",
    "the advantage of the one - state - one - singularity approach advocated here is that the singular structure of the perturbative kernel of the lipmann - schwinger equation @xmath43 is near to trivial .",
    "characterizing states by their energy simplifies the equations to such an extent that a greater part of the calculations can be performed analytically , as we will see below .",
    "note , when the kinematical domain of validity is restricted to the energies where only the designated states , that appear as channels in the lipmann - schwinger equation , can go on shell , the result is fully covariant with the replacement eq .",
    "( [ eqetos ] ) .    given a particular threshold behavior @xmath44 , associated with a partial wave , we use as leading order approximation for @xmath38 : @xmath45 + 1 } } \\theta(s / s_{\\rm",

    "the power @xmath44 is not only related to the partial wave , but also to kinematical factors which are different for a heavy - light system like @xmath48 and an equal mass system , like @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore , it depends as well on the kinematical range of the threshold , _",
    "i.e. _ , if the threshold extends to where the masses are comparable to the energy , it would yield a different threshold behavior .",
    "for example , in the @xmath48 scattering in the @xmath50 region , the real threshold behavior stops at about 50 mev above the threshold .",

    "the first coefficient @xmath55 such that the threshold behavior is determined solely by the power @xmath44 and the coupling constant .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath11 are dimensionless .",
    "note , that no additional dimensionful quantities are introduced beside the threshold energy , which makes a good candidate for a normalized description of resonance scattering , which is up to now littered with different form factors with all kind of dimensionful quantities with little meaning .",
    "if any dimensional quantities , such as the qcd scale , pion decay constant , or the pion mass , are relevant the can be expressed as a number times the threshold energy @xmath56 .",
    "each of these terms in the polynomial expansion has a closed form solution for the dispersion integral , where we distinquish integer and half - integer values for @xmath44 in @xmath57 : @xmath58 where @xmath59 refers to a taylor - laurent expansion of all the singular terms in @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "the function @xmath62 eq .",
    "( [ eqp ] ) peaks at @xmath63 , while @xmath64 peaks at @xmath65 , such that every higher order term in @xmath66 extend the range of energies over which @xmath38 can be fitted .",
    "the polynomials form a @xmath67 basis for @xmath29 on @xmath68 .",
    "the real part @xmath69 can be derived in closed form by expanding the series and resumming the terms , analogous to the calculation in @xcite . however , since the singularity at @xmath42 has to cancel , and the difference can only be meromorphic functions that fall off at infinity , it is simple to see that the real part is restricted to the trivial analytical continuation and the laurent series .",
    "the functions @xmath69 generally have a large negative value , leading to a negative mass shift .",
    "this is mainly due to the large high - energy tail @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "this leading order behavior is necessary to be able to fit arbitrary @xmath38 dependence , however , might be suppressed in the actual scattering , with an equal reduction of the mass shift .    using these functions to solve",
    "the lipmann - schwinger equation in closed form effectively means making a simultaneous , or coherent , bubble sum approximation in each of the decay channels for each of the resonances .",
    "therefore we refer to this method as the coherent bubble sum approximation .",
    "single bubble sum approximations have been used widely .",
    "it corresponds to dressing the propagator of the resonance with its single or multiple decay channels .",
    "however , the case of an unitary , analytical , and covariant approach with channel mixing has only appeared at the heart of a few coupled - channel analyses with fixed form factors .",
    "@xcite in the case of a single resonance , the bubble sum can be seen as a dressing of the resonance particle ; a change in the particle properties . in the case of coupled channels",
    "such an interpretation does not exist . in this case",
    "only the physical observables in the scattering experiment are free of ambiguities in the interpretation . in simple terms , the resonance properties are intertwined and co - dependent .    solving the lipmann - schwinger equation eq .",
    "( [ eqls ] ) reduces to solving the algebraic equation eq .",
    "( [ eqt22 ] ) , and determining the laurent - taylor expansions , which is automated in the bubblegum code .",
    "the @xmath2-matrix method leaves the real part of the resonance pole in the same position .",
    "the coherent bubble sum shifts the pole in order to satisfy analyticity contraints .",
    "these shifts can be substantial . however , the word `` mass shifts '' suggest that all effects can be reabsorbed in shifting the mass such that it accounts for main differences between @xmath2-matrix and @xmath0-matrix results .",
    "this is generally not the case . in a coupled channel problem ,",
    "the mass shifts differ from channel to channel . in the @xmath2-matrix the real part of the pole , _",
    "i.e. _ , the position where the real part of the amplitude crosses the axis , is at the same location in every channel as long as the coupling constant is not too large . only for large coupling constants",
    "unitary yields stringent constraints for the @xmath2-matrix , which can shift theses locations independently . for the exact result",
    "this does not hold .",
    "the isobar model , @xcite which implies resonance properties independent of the decay channels , is therefore flawed from the start .",
    "the procedure of finite mass renormalization is not unique .",
    "however , in order to make the comparison between @xmath2-matrix and exact results more meaningful for the @xmath2-matrix method , one can make a global mass shift @xmath72 for resonance @xmath73 , which , in some way , averages the shifts in each of the channel : @xmath74 } { \\cal w}_1 { \\cal w}_2 ) } { \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial m_a } ( e - m_a ) ( 1- x_{11 } { \\cal w}_1 - x_{22 } { \\cal w}_2 + { \\rm det[x ] } { \\cal w}_1 { \\cal w}_2 ) } \\ \\ , \\label{eqms}\\ ] ] where the expression is given by the common denominator in all of the @xmath0-matrix channels , eq .",
    "( [ t11]-[t21 ] ) .",
    "the term in the denominator corresponds to the appropriate wave function renormalization . in the case of small coupled - channel effects and small overlap of the resonances the real part of the shifted pole positions",
    "coincide with the expected channel - independent pole position .",
    "however , in the case large couplings or coupled - channel effects this independent resonance mass shift breaks down , _",
    "i.e. _ , linear approximation of the denominator around the pole is no longer valid . in that case",
    "an iterative optimizing scheme to recover the mass shifts is required . however , as the mass shift is not an invariant quantity , the results from such a scheme would have no real significance .",
    "eventually one has to accept that the scattering data and the bare properties and couplings are the only well - defined quantities .",
    "however , the bare masses must always be given in combination with the coupling constants and the form factors .",
    "this method of comparing scattering data to resonance properties can also serve as an approximate method for handling additional @xmath21-exchange processes . for low and medium energy scattering , @xmath21-exchange diagrams will not go on - shell , _",
    "i.e. _ , there is no imaginary part associated with the perturbative diagram @xmath75 .",
    "however , the real part is a direct consequence of the energies at which the @xmath21-exchange diagram goes on - shell and strength in the channel .",
    "therefore , the contributions can be approximated by a single resonance : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a measure of the kinematical range over which the @xmath21-exchange diagram can go on shell , and @xmath78 is the mean of that measure : @xmath79 in the case where the @xmath21-exchange diagram has an imaginary part in the kinematical range of interest , this approximation will not hold .",
    "more appropriate methods for this problem are under investigation and will be reported later .    in effective field theory highly virtual intermediate states",
    "are replaced by effective contact interactions .",
    "the effective resonance described here does more than that .",

    "we fit the data between threshold and 1.77 gev with minimal model of two bare masses and four coupling constants . beyond the resonance region",
    "there is still a substantial amplitude , and little data in other than the @xmath48 channel , which might indicate the importance of @xmath83 final states , and @xmath21-channel exchanges .",
    "a kink in the @xmath80 data at 1.3 gev is a further indication of @xmath83 states . for the clarity of the example",
    "we do not include the high - energy region and work with the minimal parameter set of six parameters .",
    "we use the gwu - vpi partial wave data@xcite for the @xmath48 elastic amplitude and the results from the pitt - anl analysis@xcite for the @xmath81 channel .",
    "standard fitting algorithms do not work properly as the variables are highly correlated in a non - trivial manner due to the unitarity and analyticity conditions .",
    "instead we performed a global search , with an increasing mesh , zooming in on the optimal fit .    in figure",
    "[ fig ] we compare the exact @xmath0-matrix results with the @xmath2-matrix and breit - wigner approximations .",
    "the top left figure shows real part of the @xmath80 transition amplitude , while the imaginary part appears on the right .",
    "the bottom row is the same combination for the @xmath81 transition amplitude .",
    "the bare masses are 1.60 gev and 1.79 gev , while the renormalized masses come to 1.51 gev and 1.71 gev .",
    "the latter are used for the @xmath2-matrix and the breit - wigner approximations . without these mass shifts",
    "( [ eqms ] ) , the approximate results would have no resemblance with the data .",
    "the dotted line and the circles are the pitt - anl and gwu - vpi partial waves for the @xmath82 and the @xmath48 channels respectively .",
    "the deviation for the @xmath82 partial wave is due to the large error uncertainty , which led to the dominance of the @xmath48 channel in the fit .",
    "however , varying the relative importance of the @xmath82 data , with respect to the @xmath48 data , did not significantly altered the results .",
    "it seems that the pitt - anl and gwu - vpi partial wave analysis , which include background terms , lead to an inconsistent @xmath82 amplitude that can not be fitted with with a resonance - only model like the coherent bubble sum approximation . with the current @xmath82 data it is not possible to determine the nature of the deviations , and whether the data favors a background contribution",
    "however , there seems to be no natural explanation for a background contribution .",
    "the background should model some degrees of freedom , or states , that are important yet virtual , _",
    "i.e. _ , not associated with open channels , such as , perhaps , the @xmath32-exchange between the @xmath48 pair .",
    "including the first term @xmath84 in the expansion eq .",
    "( [ eqex ] ) of the form factors halves the mean square deviation between the data and the fit .",
    "notably , it increases the effective width of the @xmath48 form factor , while it decreases the effective width of the @xmath82 form factors , corresponding , respectively , to a positive and a negative expansion coefficient @xmath84 .",
    "note that it would be possible to obtain better fits in the @xmath2-matrix approximation and the breit - wigner approximation .",
    "however , the purpose of this paper is to point out the differences which are solely the result of the approximations made , keeping the model identical . in this case",
    "it is clear that the first resonance @xmath4 is overestimated in both approximations .",
    "the coupling constants are @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",
    "the @xmath2-matrix approximation does not require the solution of the dispersion integral .",
    "therefore , it is often used to incorporate more complex interactions . in the coherent bubble sum approximation",
    "it correspond to setting @xmath89 to zero .",
    "the breit - wigner approximation is generally not a well - defined procedure .",
    "eventually it boils down to replacing the complex interaction by a sum of breit - wigner forms with partial widths for each of the decay channels in each of the resonances : @xmath90 where , in principle , each of the coupling constants and @xmath91 s are unknown and should be recovered from the analysis .",
    "however , given the @xmath38 s and the coupling constants , the closest general analogy is given by @xmath92 .",
    "from the example of the @xmath3 resonances , where the coupling strength is moderate , it is clear that both the @xmath2-matrix and the breit - wigner approximation leads to significant deviations in the transition amplitudes .",
    "a feature of scattering data where approximate methods such as breit - wigner and @xmath2-matrix approximations yield erroneous results is the interaction between thresholds and subthreshold resonances .",
    "a resonance with a strong coupling to a channel with a threshold at a higher energy might lead to anomalous threshold behavior .",
    "once a resonance has an energy close enough to the threshold energy , it might get attracted into the channel , giving either a full circle in the argand plot , or a sharp spike in the real part of the transition amplitude . neither feature is properly reproduced in the breit - wigner or the @xmath2-matrix method .    in this paper the form of @xmath38",
    "is not derived .",
    "only simple assumptions about its threshold behavior are made .",
    "the energy dependence can be modeled by a polynomial in the variable @xmath93 .",
    "this freedom is an essential part of the coherent bubble sum approximation .",
    "if possible , the data should determine the function @xmath38 .",
    "its value should be extracted from the scattering data without model dependence .",
    "it was only assumed that @xmath38 falls off at infinity , which is considered realistic for composite hadronic systems . analyzing resonance scattering data and modeling",
    "transition matrix elements of hadronic states are two separate problems and should be treated as such . in future studies we will examine @xmath21-exchange , multi - particle final states , and field - theoretical approaches which require renormalization .",
