    "<S> a model of localized classical electrons coupled to lattice degrees of freedom and , via the coulomb interaction , to each other , has been studied to gain insight into the charge and orbital ordering observed in lightly doped manganese perovskites . </S>",
    "<S> expressions are obtained for the minimum energy and ionic displacements caused by given hole and electron orbital configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the expressions are analyzed for several hole configurations , including that experimentally observed by yamada _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ in @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , although the preferred charge and orbital ordering depend sensitively on parameters , there are ranges of the parameters in which the experimentally observed hole configuration has the lowest energy . </S>",
    "<S> for these parameter values we also find that the energy differences between different hole configurations are on the order of the observed charge ordering transition temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of additional strains are also studied . </S>",
    "<S> some results for @xmath1 are presented , although our model may not adequately describe this material because the high temperature phase is metallic .    over the last few years </S>",
    "<S> much attention has been focused on manganese perovskite - based oxides , most notably the pseudocubic materials @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> ( here @xmath3 is a rare earth element such as la , and @xmath4 is a divalent alkali metal element such as ca or sr . ) </S>",
    "<S> the initial motivation came from the observation that for some range of @xmath5 , and temperature , @xmath6 , resistance can be reduced by a factor of up to @xmath7 in the presence of a magnetic field.@xcite two other interesting physical phenomena occurring in this class of materials are charge ordering and orbital ordering.@xcite in this paper , we study the connection between the two .    </S>",
    "<S> the important electrons in @xmath2 are the mn @xmath8 electrons ; their concentration is @xmath9 . for many choices of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , especially at commensurate @xmath5 values , the @xmath8 charge distribution is not uniform and it indeed appears that a fraction @xmath5 of mn ions have no @xmath8 electron while @xmath9 have a localized @xmath8 electron . a periodic pattern of filled and empty sites is said to exhibit charge ordering . </S>",
    "<S> there are two @xmath8 orbitals per mn ion . </S>",
    "<S> a localized mn @xmath8 electron will be in one linear combination of these ; a periodic pattern of orbital occupancy is said to exhibit orbital ordering . </S>",
    "<S> recently , murakami _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite observed the charge ordering transition accompanying simultaneous orbital ordering in @xmath10 at 217 k ( well above the magnetic phase transition temperature 110 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> it indicates that the interplay of the charge and orbital ordering to minimize the lattice energy could be the origin of the charge ordering . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present an expression for the coupling between charge and orbital ordering , with different charge ordering patterns favoring different orbital orderings . </S>",
    "<S> we also argue that the orbital ordering energy differences determine the observed charge ordering in lightly doped manganites . </S>",
    "<S> localized charges induce local lattice distortions , which must be accommodated into the global crystal structure ; the energy cost of this accommodation is different for different charge ordering patterns .    to model the charge and orbital ordering , we assume that the electrons are localized classical objects , so that each mn site is occupied by zero or one @xmath8 electron , and each @xmath8 electron is in a definite orbital state . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption seems reasonable in the lightly doped materials such as @xmath0 , which are strongly insulating at all temperatures,@xcite but may not be reasonable for the @xmath1 composition,@xcite where the charge ordered state emerges at a low temperature from a metallic state . </S>",
    "<S> we proceed by calculating the energies of different charge ordering patterns , emphasizing the 1/8 doping case . </S>",
    "<S> it is practically impossible to consider all possible charge ordering configurations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we consider the three configurations shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , which are the only ones consistent with the following basic features of the hole - lattice implied by the experimental results by yamada _ </S>",
    "<S> et al._@xcite : invariance under translation by two lattice constants in the @xmath5 or @xmath11 direction , four in the @xmath12 direction , and an alternating pattern of occupied and empty planes along @xmath12 direction . </S>",
    "<S> the configuration in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) is the one proposed by yamada _ </S>",
    "<S> et al._@xcite to explain their experimental results for @xmath0 . for localized electrons </S>",
    "<S> there are three energy terms : the coupling to the lattice , which will be discussed at length below , the coulomb interaction , and the magnetic interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we argue that the coulomb energy can not explain the observed ordering pattern or transition temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we take as reference the state with one @xmath8 electron per mn and denote by @xmath13 the charge of a hole on a mn site . from the classical coulomb energy @xmath14 </S>",
    "<S> one finds that the difference in energy between the configurations in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a site containing a hole and @xmath17 is the difference in charge between the two configurations . </S>",
    "<S> we estimated the above infinite sum by repeated numerical calculations for larger and larger volumes of the unit cells around the origin . </S>",
    "<S> we find that fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c ) has the lowest energy ; 12 mev/@xmath18 lower than fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) , and 27 mev/@xmath18 lower than fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) .    </S>",
    "<S> to estimate the magnitude of the coulomb energy differences , we need an estimate for the dielectric constant @xmath19 , which we obtain from the measured reflectivity for @xmath20,@xcite and the lyddane - sachs - teller relation@xcite @xmath21 . at frequencies greater than the greatest phonon frequency </S>",
    "<S> the reflectivity is close to 0.1 , implying @xmath22 ; the reflectivity is near unity between @xmath23 ev , and @xmath24 ev , implying @xmath25 . because both @xmath0 and @xmath20 are insulating and have similar compositions , their static dielectric constants are expected to be similar . using @xmath26 , the energy difference between different configurations of holes is only around 2.4 mev , or 30 k per hole , which is small compared to the observed charge ordering temperature of 150 k @xmath27 200 k of these materials . the inconsistency with the experimentally observed hole configuration and the smallness of the energy difference scale indicate that the electrostatic energy is not the main origin of charge ordering for this material .    </S>",
    "<S> even though the magnetic and charge ordering transitions show a correlation in @xmath0,@xcite we do not think that the magnetic contribution to charge and orbital ordering is as important as the lattice contribution for three reasons . </S>",
    "<S> first , in undoped @xmath28 , the orbital ordering and the structural phase transition occur at around 800 k and the magnetic ordering at around 140 k,@xcite suggesting that the magnetic effects are relatively weak . </S>",
    "<S> second , in @xmath0 the mn spins are ferromagnetically ordered with moment close to the full mn moment at temperatures greater than the charge ordering temperature,@xcite and ferromagnetic order does not favor one charge configuration over another . </S>",
    "<S> third , although in @xmath0 antiferromagnetic order appears at the charge ordering transition , the antiferromagnetic moment is very small ( less than 0.1 of the full mn moment),@xcite so the energy associated with this ordering must be much less than 140 k / site associated with magnetic ordering in @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we think that the canted antiferromagnetism occuring upon charge ordering in @xmath0 ( ref .  </S>",
    "<S> 7 ) is not the cause but the effect of the charge and orbital ordering . </S>",
    "<S> we now turn our attention to the lattice energy .    </S>",
    "<S> a classical model for the lattice distortions of the insulating perovskite manganites has been derived in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> 10 , and shown to be consistent with experimental results on @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> this model is adopted here with an additional term , an energy cost for shear strain . </S>",
    "<S> we now briefly outline the model , which is explained in more detail in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> 10 and the appendix . </S>",
    "<S> the ionic displacements included are the vector displacement @xmath29 of the mn ion on site @xmath30 , and the @xmath31 directional scalar displacement @xmath32 ( @xmath33 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ) of the o ion which sits between the mn ion on site @xmath30 and the mn ion on site @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> for convenience , @xmath29 and @xmath32 are defined to be dimensionless in the following way : the lattice constant of the ideal cubic perovskite is @xmath35 , the mn ion position in the ideal cubic perovskite is @xmath36 , the actual mn ion position is @xmath37 , and the actual o ion position is @xmath38 . the lattice energy is taken to be harmonic and depends only on the nearest neighbor mn - o distance and the first and second nearest neighbor mn - mn distances . </S>",
    "<S> the spring constants corresponding to these displacements are @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . because @xmath39 and @xmath40 involve bond stretching , while @xmath41 involves bond bending , @xmath42 is expected . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath43 , where @xmath44^{2 }     \\nonumber \\\\ & & +    \\left [ \\left(\\frac{\\delta^a_{i+a - b}-\\delta^b_{i+a - b}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)-    \\left(\\frac{\\delta^a_{i}-\\delta^b_{i}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\right]^{2}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above equations @xmath45 denotes @xmath5 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , and @xmath46 represents @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath50 was not considered in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> 10 . </S>",
    "<S> the shear modulus produced by this term is important , because without it , a mn ion on site @xmath51 can have arbitrary large @xmath11 directional displacement relative to the mn ion on site @xmath30 at no cost of energy . for this reason , </S>",
    "<S> the model with @xmath52 has singularities , whose proper treatment requires @xmath53 in our model . </S>",
    "<S> however , still we expect @xmath41 will be much smaller than @xmath39 or @xmath40 . therefore , in order to simplify the calculation , the @xmath54 limit has been taken after the expression of minimized energy and equilibrium ionic displacements have been obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> second , we consider the electronic degree of freedom . we parameterize the electron density by the variable @xmath55 . if an electron is present on site @xmath30 , @xmath56 ; if no electron is present , @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> if there is an electron on site @xmath30 , the electron orbital state , which is a linear combination of the two @xmath8 orbitals , is parameterized by an angle @xmath58 as follows . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath59 with @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> the electron orbital state couples to the distortion of the surrounding oxygen octahedra through the jahn - teller distortion . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling is given by @xmath61 \\nonumber \\\\   & = & -\\lambda\\sum_{i , a}(1-h_{i})v^{a}_{i } \\cos{2(\\theta_{i}+\\psi_{a } ) } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 if a hole is present on site @xmath30 , it attracts the surrounding oxygens equally , giving rise to a breathing distortion energy given by @xmath63 the parameter @xmath64 represents the strength of the breathing distortion relative to the jahn - teller distortion . </S>",
