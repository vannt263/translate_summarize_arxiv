    "specifically , the pbe functional is accurate for both hard materials and individual molecules and has accordingly found widespread applications @xcite .",
    "the last decade has witnessed the successful introduction of the van der waals ( vdw ) density functional ( vdw - df ) method @xcite , launched as a systematic extension @xcite of lda and gga . unlike local and semi - local functionals such as the latter two it describes also the much larger class of sparse systems @xcite , e.g. , molecular solids , layered materials , and weak chemisorption cases , in which binding across internal voids arises from a truly nonlocal , vdw - type binding .",
    "the chalmers- rutgers vdw - df method is focused on the electron response and has both regular releases ( vdw - df1 @xcite , vdw - df2 @xcite , and vdw - df - cx @xcite ) and variants ( including vdw - df - c09 @xcite , optb88 , optpbe @xcite , optb86b,@xcite and rev - vdw - df2 @xcite ) .",

    "it is commonly required that the chosen approach must be accurate both when there are important regions of low - electron concentration , i.e. , sparse matter such as in intermolecular binding @xcite , and when studying dense matter , i.e. , harder materials such as transition metals .",

    "specifically , we consider lattice parameters , thermal expansion , and bulk moduli at finite temperature as well as the cohesive energies including zero - point contributions at the level of he quasi harmonic approximation ( qha ) .",

    "we show that vdw - df - cx meets and exceeds the performance of the pbe , pbesol and am05 functionals for nonmagnetic transition metals .",
    "this suggests that vdw - df - cx provides a good , balanced description of nonlocal exchange and nonlocal correlation also in this type of materials .",

    "several previous studies have shown that some vdw - df approaches can work well for solids @xcite .",
    "while this has helped build trust in the vdw - df method , constraint - based functionals such as vdw - df - cx , pbe , pbesol , and am05 are all linked to the acf and conservation @xcite and can thus be expected to yield good transferability .",
    "yet as briefly reviewed below different physical aspects were emphasized in their construction and one can thus expect to gain insight into strengths and limitations of each approach exactly because these functionals are each representatives of a specific design logic . by focusing the present benchmark on constraint - based functionals",
    "we are thus able to draw more general conclusions .",
    "the four constraint - based functionals considered in the present work share some common traits while also having some distinct differences in their design logic , making it interesting to contrast their performance .",
    "all matter has internal surfaces with a variation between higher and lower electron density regions and insight from surface physics underpins all designs .",
    "it led langreth and perdew to the early gga @xcite and it entered the specification of gradient - corrected correlation in pbesol @xcite and am05 @xcite .",
    "these concepts are also central to the development of the vdw - df method @xcite , which takes the surface idea , however , further than in the gga , noting that a semi - local representation of the electron - gas response does not retain a full description of the electrodynamical coupling among ( gga ) xc holes @xcite .",

    "semi - local gga functionals can be expressed via the local variation in the xc energy per particle @xmath9 here , the xc enhancement factor @xmath10 reflects the physical nature of the associated semi- local xc hole @xcite .",
    "the pbe functional @xcite is an important example of a constraint - based gga @xcite .",
    "the pbe was designed by first constructing a numerical gga with an enhancement factor @xmath11 that reflects conditions on the shape of the semi - local xc hole description and , in a subsequent step , by extracting an analytical form for the pbe @xmath12 for practical use .",
    "one can expect a high degree of transferability because it is anchored in conservation laws @xcite .",
    "in fact the pbe functional has had a huge impact on materials theory and has turned out to be an extremely successful general - purpose functional for systems with dense electron distributions including both individual molecules and hard materials @xcite .",
    "one of the best performing constraint - based semi - local functionals for condensed matter is the pbesol functional @xcite .",
    "while , as in the case of pbe , the nature of screened many - body response and the xc hole were emphasized during its construction , its authors also relied on other formal results in its design . the gga framework that underpins",
    "both pbe and pbesol is very powerful but it is not possible to satisfy all constraints at the same time .",
    "expansion that is also suggested by exact - scaling results for atomic - like high - density regions .",
    "@xcite by contrast , in the construction of pbesol one obtains a behavior consistent with diagrammatic results for pure exchange in the weakly perturbed electron gas .",
    "] the pbe functional is highly transferable and works very well for both molecular formation energies and the structure and energies of hard materials . as a result of the diagrammatic ( gradient - expansion ) emphasis pbesol yields an even better description of the structure of hard materials @xcite .",
    "the am05 constraint - based functional @xcite performs very well for describing the structure of dense materials .",
    "it provides an , in principle , exact account of exchange effects for surfaces , i.e. , the boundary between regions of higher and lower electron densities , whereas for internal regions this surface - exchange description is merged with that of the lda . like pbesol , the am05 functional extracts the gradient - corrected correlation from a study of the jellium surface energy .",

    "the vdw - df method captures vdw forces among dimers in the asymptotic and the binding limits@xcite as well as attraction between two - dimensional layers @xcite .",
    "importantly , it also captures the more general problem when nonlocal correlation forces compete with other types of forces , @xcite for example , giving rise to binding across important regions of low electron densities @xcite .",
    "the method was expected to be relevant in first - principle dft for both pure vdw problems including regular physisorption @xcite , porous - materials gas absorption @xcite , and dna base - pair interactions @xcite .",
    "it was also quickly realized that truly nonlocal correlations affect materials descriptions much more broadly than what was perhaps originally anticipated @xcite .",

    "so far we used experimental values from compilations of standard values @xcite as reference data for equilibrium volumes ( lattice constants ) , bulk moduli , and thermal expansion coefficients . while the data for lattice constants are usually very accurate , it must be acknowledged that measurements of bulk moduli and thermal expansion coefficients can carry rather significant errors , which are usually not documented in reference compendia .",

    "( [ eq : vdwdffram ] ) , implies picking a semi - local exchange component in @xmath24 that is given by diagramatic expansion and therefore is similar to that of pbesol in the low - to - medium @xmath26 regime . yet",
    ", vdw - df - cx still replaces the pbesol description of gradient - corrected correlation entirely with a truly nonlocal xc term @xmath77 .",
    "the fact that df - cx performs at a pbesol level with respect to hard materials thus suggests that vdw - df - cx achieves a good balance between exchange and correlation .",
    "this observation makes it plausible that one can obtain further functional improvements by relying on the acf recast , eq .",
    "( [ eq : vdwdffram ] ) , for descriptions of nonlocal correlation effects @xcite .",
    "this study presents a comprehensive benchmark of constraint - based semi - local and non - local functionals with respect to finite temperature thermophysical properties of nonmagnetic transition metals .",
    "the main outcome of this comparison is that , unlike its predecessors in the vdw - df family , the recently developed non - local vdw - df - cx version achives good transferability and accuracy also for hard materials .",
    "this is crucial , for example , for investigations of weakly - bound molecules at transition - metal surfaces . in the case of vdw - df1 and vdw - df2 ,",
    "the substantial overestimation of the lattice constants of the late transition metals , in particular ag and au , limited their application to these systems .",
    "the successful validation of vdw - df - cx for these cases allows full ionic relaxation and thus tracking the impact of e.g. , associated adsorption - induced surface modifications @xcite .    in completing our work",
    "we found that ambrosetti and silvestrelli @xcite recently presented a related benchmarking of how a range of functionals , including vdw - df - cx , performs for the coinage metals .",
    "our findings are consistent with their results but we have a broader scope as we consider the entire set of nonmagnetic transition metals and assess performance by comparing with experiments on a range of thermo - physical properties .",
    "this broader scope is instrumental for asserting the transferability of the method and provides a strong test of the robustness of the underlying physical input .    for the other functionals considered here the excellent performance",
    "is expected but it is interesting to note that the truly nonlocal functional vdw - df - cx has as good if not better performance and transferability .",
    "this is encouraging for further development that builds of the vdw - df framework .",
    "finally , we observe that quantitative comparisons as in the tables included in the supplementary material can also assist a crude benchmarking of future vdw - df versions .",
    "this is because the tables implicitly provide a quantification of the net differences between the raw kohn - sham results and the associated room temperature characterizations that are relevant for comparison with most experimental observations .",
    "we thank kristian berland for discussions .",
    "this work has been supported by the swedish research council ( vr ) and the knut and alice wallenberg foundation as well as computer time allocations by the swedish national infrastructure for computing at nsc ( linkping ) , hpc2n ( ume ) , and c3se ( gothenburg ) .",
