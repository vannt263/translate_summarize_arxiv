    "in an influential paper @xcite , hitchin initiated a systematic study of compact twistor spaces by algebro - geometric means .",
    "in particular , by investigating the half - anticanonical system of twistor spaces , he showed that if a compact twistor space admits a khler metric , it must be one of the two standard twistor spaces , the projective space or the flag manifold .",
    "this direction of research was succeeded by poon @xcite and kreussler - kurke @xcite to determine structure of twistor spaces over the connected sum of two or three complex projective planes , by means of the same system on the twistor spaces .",
    "also , lebrun @xcite and campana - kreussler @xcite utilized the same system to investigate particular moishezon twistor spaces over the connected sum of any number of complex projective planes .",
    "however , for other twistor spaces , it was evident that the half - anticanonical system no longer brings enough information for analyzing structure of the spaces , because the system is at most a pencil",
    ". therefore multiples of the half - anticanonical system have been used in order to find out and explore new moishezon twistor spaces . in these analyses",
    "the first essential part is always to find a pluri - half - anticanonical system which is not composed with the half - anticanonical system . once this is established , by investigating the rational map associated to the multiple system , we can make a traditional analysis in algebraic geometry to gain detailed structure of the twistor spaces .    in the paper @xcite",
    ", we pursued such a direction and found a series of moishezon twistor spaces on @xmath0 , the connected sum of @xmath1 complex projective planes where @xmath1 being arbitrary with @xmath2 , such that the @xmath3-th power of the half - anticanonical system induces a rational map which is two - to - one over the image .",
    "this image is a scroll of 2-planes over a rational normal curve , which is canonically embedded in @xmath4 , and the branch divisor is a cut of the scroll by a single quartic hypersurface .",
    "further , a defining equation of the quartic hypersurface was determined .",
    "while these twistor spaces on @xmath0 can be regarded as a generalization of the twistor spaces on @xmath5 studied by poon @xcite and kreussler - kurke @xcite , from detail investigation in the case of @xmath6 @xcite , it is strongly expected that the twistor spaces in @xcite are specialization of more general twistor spaces which also have a double covering structure over the same scroll .",
    "a purpose of this paper is to show that this is really the case , and determine the defining equation of the quartic hypersurface which cuts out the branch divisor of the double covering .",
    "however , for the actual analysis totally new method is required , because unlike the ones in @xcite , the present twistor spaces do not have an effective @xmath7-action .",
    "in section [ ss : s ] we construct a rational surface @xmath8 and investigate its pluri - anticanonical systems .",
    "we are concerned with a twistor space on @xmath0 which contains this surface @xmath8 as a member of the half - anticanonical system @xmath9 .",
    "we devote most of section [ ss : ps ] to prove that the multiple system @xmath10 of the twistor space is not composed with the system @xmath9 ( which is just a pencil ) . the basic idea for proving this is simple to the effect that we pick up distinct @xmath3 general members of the pencil @xmath9 and look at the restriction of the system @xmath10 to the union of these members .",
    "however , this does not work well in this primitive form and we need to blowup the twistor space at the base curve of @xmath9 .",
    "this makes the @xmath3 divisors disjoint , and further by letting the exceptional divisor of the blowup to be included in the restriction , we obtain a crucial vanishing of cohomology groups ( proposition [ prop : mainvan ] ) .",
    "this reduces the computations for the multiple system to those on a divisor of smooth normal crossing .",
    "the computations on the last divisor work very effectively , and we can finally show that the system @xmath10 is @xmath1-dimensional as a linear system ( proposition [ prop : z ] ) . once this is proved , it is not difficult to show that the image of the rational map associated to the multiple system is a scroll of planes over a rational normal curve in @xmath11 , and that the map is two - to - one over the scroll , whose branch divisor is a cut of the scroll by a quartic hypersurface ( proposition [ prop : z2 ] ) .",
    "section [ s : red ] is employed to show that there exist two special reducible members of the system @xmath10 which consist of two irreducible components .",
    "these two divisors play a significant role for obtaining the defining equation of the quartic hypersurface .",
    "the chern classes of the irreducible components of these reducible members are presented in explicit forms ( proposition [ prop : red ] ) . the method for proving",
    "this existence is similar to the method in section [ s : ps ] , but as a restriction we have to take degree - one divisors instead of the divisors in @xmath9 , which makes the computations considerably heavier and much more subtle .",
    "but again by making the exceptional divisor of the same blowup to be included in the restriction , we are able to obtain a critical vanishing result ( proposition [ prop : mainvan3 ] ) .",
    "then after long computations over the degree - one divisors and the exceptional divisors , we finally obtain the desired existence of the special reducible members of the system @xmath10 .    like most other non - projective moishezon twistor spaces , the multiple system @xmath10 has non - empty base locus . in section [ s : deg1 ]",
    "we provide a complete elimination of the base locus , by a succession of explicit blowups ( proposition [ prop : elim ] ) .",
    "while the base locus of the system consists of just strings of smooth rational curves , for a complete elimination a number of blowing - up is required .",
    "as a consequence , we obtain information about the image of particular twistor lines and degree - one divisors under the rational map associated to @xmath10 .    in the final section , assembling all the results in sections [ s : ps ] , [ s : red ] and [ s : deg1 ] , we determine a defining equation of the quartic hypersurface which cuts out the branch divisor on the scroll . in section [ ss : dc ] , by utilizing the reducible members obtained in section [ s : red ] , we find special curves on the branch divisor and prove the existence of a quadratic hypersurface in @xmath4 which contains all these special curves . in section [ s : de ]",
    "we prove the main result which determines the defining equation of the quartic hypersurface ( theorem [ thm : main ] ) .",
    "the argument in the proof is mostly algebraic , and is an improvement of the proof given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.5 ) .",
    "finally in section [ ss : moduli ] we first compute the dimension of the moduli space of the present twistor spaces .",
    "next we discuss some global structure of the moduli space .",
    "in particular , we see that the present moduli space can be partially compactified ( completed ) by attaching some part ( a stratum ) of the moduli spaces of lebrun twistor spaces .",
    "we also mention that a stratum of of the moduli space of the twistor spaces constructed in @xcite is also naturally attached to give a partial compactification of the moduli space of the present twistor spaces",

    "* the letter @xmath12 always denotes the canonical square root of the anticanonical line bundle over a twistor space .",
    "the degree of a divisor in a twistor space means the intersection number with a twistor line .",
    "linear equivalence between divisors are often denoted by ` @xmath13 ' .",
    "if @xmath14 is a subvariety of a complex manifold @xmath15 , and if @xmath16 is a sheaf over @xmath15 , we often write @xmath17 to mean @xmath18 . we also write @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",

    "( this means that blown - up point is always the intersection point of @xmath29 with the exceptional curves of the last blowup , and similar for the conjugate point . )",

    "we note that in this construction of the surface @xmath8 , all freedom is in choosing two points on @xmath29 and one point on @xmath32 in the construction of the surface @xmath39 , and there is no freedom in all the remaining blowups @xmath44 .",
