    "the propagations of the ( 1+d)-dimensional light - envelopes in nonlinear media have been studied extensively for a few decades  @xcite , which are governed by the following dimensionless model  @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the complex amplitude envelop , @xmath2 is the light - induced nonlinear refractive index , @xmath3 is the longitudinal coordinate , @xmath4 is the @xmath5-dimensional transverse coordinate vector with @xmath5 being the positive integer , and @xmath6 is the @xmath5-dimensional differential operator vector of the transverse coordinates .",
    "generally , @xmath2 can be phenomenologically expressed as the convolution between the response function @xmath7 of the media and the modulus square of the light - envelope @xmath1 for the bulk media with the nonlocal nonlinearity  @xcite @xmath8 according to the relative scale of the characteristic length of the response function _",
    "r _ and the scale in the transverse dimension occupied by the light - envelope @xmath9 , the degree of nonlocality can be divided into four categories@xcite : local , weakly nonlocal , generally nonlocal , and strongly nonlocal , and locality is the case when the response function _",
    "r _ is the dirac delta function . in the local case , eq.([nnlse ] ) is reduced to @xmath10 eq .",
    "( [ nnlse ] ) together with the nonlocal nonlinearity  ( [ nonlocal - nonlinearity ] ) is called as the nonlocal nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nnlse )  @xcite , while its special case , eq .",
    "( [ nlse ] ) , is the well - known nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse )  @xcite .",
    "the nnlse ( with its special case nlse ) can describe the nonlinear propagations of the optical beams  @xcite , the optical pulses  @xcite and the optical pulsed beams  @xcite .",
    "the second term of the nnlse accounts for the diffraction for the first case where @xmath4 is the spatial transverse coordinate , the group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) for the second case where @xmath4 is the time coordinate , and both the diffraction and the gvd for the last case where @xmath4 is both the spatial transverse coordinate and the time coordinate , while the third term ( the nonlinear term ) describes the compression of the light - envelopes for all cases . specifically , when @xmath11 , the nnlse can model the propagation of the optical beam  @xcite in the self - focusing nonlinear planar waveguide , and can also model the propagation of the optical pulse  @xcite in the self - focusing nonlinear waveguide if the carrier frequency is in the anomalous gvd regime or in the self - defocusing nonlinear waveguide when its carrier frequency is in the normal gvd regime .",
    "the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional nnlse has the spatial ( or temporal ) bright optical soliton solution  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath12 , the nnlse can only describe the propagation of the optical beam in the nonlinear bulk media .",
    "the bright spatial optical soliton can exist stably for the nonlocal case  @xcite , but for the local case the strong self - focusing of a two dimensional beam will lead to the catastrophic phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath13 , the nnlse can describe the propagation of the optical pulsed beams . like the case of @xmath12 ,",
    "the self trapped optical pulsed beam propagating in the local nonlinear media will lead to the spatiotemporal collapse  @xcite , which can be arrested by the nonlocal nonlinearity  @xcite .",
    "but when @xmath14 , the nnlse is just a phenomenological model , the counterpart of which can not be found in physics . it s important to note that@xcite",
    "the response function @xmath15 is symmetric for the spatial nonlocality , but is asymmetric for the temporal nonlocality due to the causality  @xcite .",
    "as the special case of the nnlse , the nlse ( [ nlse ] ) can be solved exactly using inverse - scattering technique  @xcite when @xmath11 .",
    "but for the general case , a closed - form solution of nnlse ( [ nnlse ] ) can not been found except for the strongly nonlocal limit , where the nnlse can be simplified to the ( linear ) snyder - mitchell model for the spatial nonlocality and an exact gaussian - shaped stationary solution known as accessible soliton was found  @xcite .",
    "approximately analytical solutions can be obtained by various of perturbation methods , such as the perturbation approach based on the inverse scattering transform  @xcite , the adiabatic perturbation approach  @xcite , the method of moments  @xcite , and the most widely used one is variational method  @xcite .",
    "it was claimed without proof that the variational method can only be applied in nonlocal cases where the response function is symmetric  @xcite .",
    "but the equivalency between the nnlse ( [ nnlse ] ) and the euler - lagrange equation is not proved rigorously until the mathematical proof given in the paper on the premise of the response function with even symmetry . and",
    "for the case of the response function without even symmetry , the method of moments can work well .",
    "another new approach is presented here , and we apply the canonical equations of hamilton to study the nonlinear light - envelope propagations . by taking this approach , the approximate analytical soliton solution of the nnlse is obtained .",
    "furthermore , the stability of solutions can be analysed analytically in a simple way as well , but it can not be done by the variational approach .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we firstly give the rigorous proof of the equivalency between the nnlse and the euler - lagrange equation in sec .",

    "the canonical equations of hamilton ( ceh ) is a parallel method to the euler - lagrange equation in classical mechanics .",

    "firstly , we show that the conventional ceh will yield contradictory and inconsistent results .",
    "secondly , we discuss the differences between our approach and the variational approach .",
    "[ conclusion ] gives the summary .",
    "the variational approach is a widely used method to obtain the approximately analytical solution of the nlse  @xcite .",
    "the reason why the variational approach can be used is that the nlse can be restated by the euler - lagrange equation , which reads ( for the sake of simpleness , only the case that d = 1 is taken consideration here ) @xmath16 if the lagrangian density @xmath17 is given by  @xcite @xmath18 replacing @xmath19 with @xmath9 , the complex - conjugate equation of the nlse can be obtained from the euler - lagrange equation ( [ euler - lagrange equation ] ) consistently .",
    "although the variational approach has been applied to the problems associated with the nnlse ( [ nnlse ] ) , in which the lagrangian density is expressed as  @xcite @xmath20 with @xmath21 , the equivalency between the nnlse ( [ nnlse ] ) and the euler - lagrange equation has not been proved rigorously . without loss of generality , here we only give the proof of the equivalency in the case that @xmath11 , and the extension to the general case of @xmath5 will be easy in a similar way .",
    "comparing the two expressions of the lagrangian density for the nlse and the nnlse , i.e. , eqs .",
    "( [ lagrangian density for nlse ] ) and ( [ lagrangian density for nnlse ] ) , we can observe that the lagrangian density for the nnlse contains a convolution between the response function @xmath15 and the modulus square of the light - envelope @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , it has been somewhat confused how to calculate such terms as @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the nnlse since @xmath24 is not the function of @xmath9 and @xmath19 but the functional of them . to this end",
    ", we first construct a functional as @xmath25 the variation of the functional @xmath26 is defined as  @xcite @xmath27dx'dxdz\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\delta n\\left[\\varphi(x , z)\\delta\\varphi^*(x , z)+\\varphi^*(x , z)\\delta\\varphi(x , z)\\right]dxdz.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if the response function is symmetric , i.e. , @xmath28 , then we can obtain that @xmath29dx'dx\\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\delta n\\left[\\varphi(x , z)\\delta\\varphi^*(x , z)+\\varphi^*(x , z)\\delta\\varphi(x , z)\\right]dx.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then the variation of the functional @xmath26 is simplified to @xmath30 on the other hand , the variation of the functional @xmath26 can be also expressed as  @xcite @xmath31\\delta\\varphi dxdz\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\left[\\frac{\\partial l_{nl}}{\\partial\\varphi^*}-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\frac{\\partial l_{nl}}{\\partial\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\varphi^*}{\\partial z}\\right)}-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial l_{nl}}{\\partial\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\varphi^*}{\\partial x}\\right)}\\right]\\delta\\varphi^*dxdz\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\partial l_{nl}}{\\partial\\varphi}\\delta\\varphi dxdz+\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\partial l_{nl}}{\\partial\\varphi^*}\\delta\\varphi^ * dxdz.\\label{variation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] comparing eqs.([deal with convolution ] ) and ( [ variation ] ) , we obtain @xmath32 inserting the lagrangian density ( [ lagrangian density for nnlse ] ) for the case of @xmath11 into the euler - lagrange equation ( [ euler - lagrange equation ] ) , the first two terms of ( [ euler - lagrange equation ] ) can be easily obtained as @xmath33 then the nnlse ( [ nnlse ] ) can be obtained from the euler - lagrange equation ( [ euler - lagrange equation ] ) by using eqs .",
    "( [ tonnlse ] ) and ( [ first two terms ] ) respectively , and its complex - conjugate equation can also be obtained consistently in a similar way .",
    "consequently , the nnlse ( [ nnlse ] ) is equivalent to the euler - lagrange equation ( [ euler - lagrange equation ] ) if the response function is symmetric .",
    "but for the asymmetric response function , for example , the response function for the temporal nonlocality  @xcite , we can not show the equivalency between the nnlse ( [ nnlse ] ) and the euler - lagrange equation ( [ euler - lagrange equation ] ) anymore . in our points of view , the conclusion obtained here is equivalent to that given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors claimed that the equation ( 1 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ( similar to the nnlse ) does not have a lagrangian when the temporally asymmetric nonlocal term is included and that `` had the nonlocality been symmetric , then variational techniques could have been applied '' , although no any proof was given in ref .",
    "as discussed in the section above , the variational approach to find the approximately analytical solution of the nnlse is based on the euler - lagrange equations . in the classical mechanics , however , there exist two theory frameworks : the lagrangian formulation ( the euler - lagrange equations ) and the hamiltonian formulation ( canonical equations of hamilton ) .",
    "the two methods are parallel , and no one is particularly superior to the another for the direct solution of mechanical problems  @xcite . the new approach presented in this paper to analytically obtain the approximate solution of the nnlse is based on the new canonical equations of hamilton ( ceh ) found by us recently  @xcite . for the sake of the systematicness and the readability of this paper , the key points about the new ceh are outlined here in this section , although the detail can be found in ref  @xcite .",
    "we firstly define two different systems of mathematical physics : the second - order differential system ( sods ) and the first - order differential system ( fods ) .",
    "the sods is defined as the system described by the second - order partial differential equation about the evolution coordinate , while the fods is defined as the system described by the first - order partial differential equation about the evolution coordinate .",
    "the newton s second law of motion and the nnlse are the exemplary sods and fods , where the evolution coordinates are the time coordinate @xmath34 and the propagation coordinate @xmath3 , respectively . the conventional ceh  @xcite @xmath35 is established on the basis of the newton s second law of motion . the dot above the variable in eqs .",

    "the ceh ( [ qi ] ) and ( [ pi ] ) can be extended to the continuous system as  @xcite @xmath41 with @xmath42 representing the components of the quantity of the continuous system  @xcite , @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote the functional derivatives of @xmath45 with respect to @xmath46 and @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and @xmath45 is the hamiltonian density of the continuous system .",
    "we have shown that the fods can not be expressed by the conventional ceh , and we have re - constructed a set of new ceh through the following procedure .",
    "for the first - order differential system of the continuous systems , the lagrangian density must be the linear function of the generalized velocities , and expressed as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is not the function of a set of @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "consequently , the generalized momentum @xmath47 , which is obtained by the definition @xmath54 as @xmath55 is only a function of @xmath46 .",

    "we take @xmath58 and @xmath59 as the independent variables , where @xmath60 .",

    "we have shown that the fods can only be expressed by the new ceh , but do not by the conventional ceh , while the sods can be done by both the new and the conventional cehs .",
    "we have also shown that the nlse can be expressed by the new ceh in a consistent way if the propagation coordinate @xmath3 in the nlse is considered to be the evolution coordinate .",
    "different from the case of the nlse , the hamiltonian density of the nnlse contains the convolution between the response function @xmath7 and the modulus square of the light - envelope @xmath1 . following the procedure in sec .",
    "[ limition on response ] , it can be easily proved that the nnlse can also be expressed with the new ceh in a consistent way if the propagation coordinate @xmath3 in the model is considered to be the evolution coordinate .",
    "based on the new ceh , we now introduce a new approach to deal with the nonlinear light - envelope propagations .",
    "we assume the trial solution of the form as @xmath73\\exp\\left[iq_c(z)r^2+iq_{\\theta}(z)\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath74 are the amplitude and phase of the complex amplitude of the light - envelope , respectively , @xmath75 is the width of the light - envelope , @xmath76 is the phase - front curvature , and they all vary with the propagation distance ( the evolution coordinate ) @xmath3 . the response function of materials is assumed as @xmath77 inserting the trial solution ( [ trial solution ] ) and the response function ( [ response function ] ) into the lagrangian density ( [ lagrangian density for nnlse ] ) , and performing the integration @xmath71 we obtain @xmath78,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is a function of generalized coordinates , @xmath79 and generalized velocities , @xmath80 ( the dot above the variable indicates the derivative with respect to the evolution coordinate @xmath3 ) , but not an explicit function of the evolution coordinate @xmath3 .",

    "it is known that the generalized momentum conjugate to a cyclic coordinate is conserved  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the generalized momentum @xmath97 conjugate to the generalized coordinate @xmath83 is a constant , which can be confirmed by eq.([dp_theta ] ) .",
    "in fact , this represents that the power of the light - envelope , @xmath98 is conservative .",
    "then we can obtain @xmath99 taking the derivative with respect to @xmath3 on both sides of eq.([qc momentum ] ) , then comparing it with eq.([dpc ] ) , we can obtain with the aid of eq.([amplitude ] ) @xmath100 then by substituting eq.([qc ] ) into the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) with the aid of eq.([amplitude ] ) , we have @xmath101 where @xmath102 are the generalized kinetic energy and the generalized potential of the hamiltonian system , respectively .",
    "now we can observe that the dynamics of the light - envelopes in nonlinear media can be treated as problems of small oscillations of a hamiltonian system about positions of equilibrium from the hamiltonian point of view .",

    "( [ kenetic ] ) and ( [ potential energy ] ) corresponds to the soliton solutions of the nnlse , and can be obtained as the extremum points of the generalized potential of the hamiltonian system .",
    "an equilibrium position is classified as stable if a small disturbance of the system from equilibrium results in small bounded motion about the rest position .",
    "the equilibrium is unstable if an infinitesimal disturbance eventually produces unbounded motion  @xcite .",
    "it can be readily seen that when the extremum of the generalized potential is a minimum the equilibrium must be stable , otherwise , the equilibrium must be unstable . in this sense , therefore , the viewpoint in some literatures  @xcite , where solitons were regarded as the extremum of the hamiltonian itself rather than the generalized potential of the hamiltonian system , would be some ambiguous . because in those literatures  @xcite the trial solution has a changeless profile ( solitonic profile ) , the state expressed with the solitonic profile is the static state .",
    "the kinetic energy of the static state is zero , and the hamiltonian is equal to the potential of the static state . in this connection , the extremum of the hamiltonian equals to the extremum of the generalized potential of the static system only in value .",
    "although the soliton solutions obtained in such literatures  @xcite are correct , it is more reasonable to consider the soliton solutions of the nnlse as the extremum points of the generalized potential of the hamiltonian system . in order to find the equilibrium position ( the soliton solution ) ,",

    "the relation between the potential @xmath108 and the width @xmath75 of the light - envelope is shown in fig.[v ] .",
