    "ldpc codes @xcite , @xcite , have been the focus of intense research over the past decade because they can approach theoretical limits of reliable transmission over various channels even when decoded by sub - optimal low complexity algorithms .",
    "two important classes of such algorithms are ( i ) iterative decoding algorithms , which include message passing algorithms ( variants of the bp algorithm @xcite and gallager type algorithms @xcite ) , and bit flipping algorithms @xcite ( serial and parallel ) , as well as ( ii ) the lp decoding algorithm @xcite .",
    "characterization of the error performance of sub - optimal algorithms ( or simply decoders ) is still an open problem , and has been addressed for both ldpc code ensembles , as well as for individual codes @xcite .",
    "error performance of ldpc codes in the asymptotic limit of the code length is well characterized for a large class of sub - optimal decoders over different channels ( the interested reader is referred to @xcite for general theory of message passing algorithms , @xcite for analysis of bit flipping algorithms and expander based arguments and @xcite for analysis of the lp decoder ) .",
    "a common feature of all the analysis methods used in deriving the asymptotic results is that the underlying assumptions hold in the limit of infinitely long code and/or are applicable to an ensemble of codes .",
    "hence , they are of limited use for the analysis of a given finite length code .",
    "the performance of a code under a particular decoding algorithm is characterized by the bit - error - rate ( ber ) or the frame - error - rate ( fer ) curve plotted as a function of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "a typical ber / fer vs snr curve consists of two distinct regions . at small snr , the error probability decreases rapidly with snr , with the curve looking like a _",
    "waterfall_. the decrease slows down at moderate values turning into the _ error floor _ asymptotic at very large snr @xcite .",
    "this transient behavior and the error floor asymptotic originate from the sub - optimality of decoder , i.e. , the ideal maximum - likelihood ( ml ) curve would not show such a dramatic change in the ber / fer with the snr increase . while the slope of the ber / fer curve in the waterfall region is the same for almost all the codes in the ensemble , there can be a huge variation in the slopes for different codes in the error floor region @xcite . since for sufficiently long codes the error floor phenomenon manifests itself in the domain unreachable by brute force monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations , analytical methods are necessary to characterize the fer performance .",
    "finite length analysis of ldpc codes is well understood for decoding over the binary erasure channel ( bec ) .",
    "the decoder failures in the error floor domain are governed by combinatorial structures known as stopping sets @xcite .",
    "stopping set distributions of various ldpc ensembles have been studied by orlitsky _",
    "( see @xcite and references therein for related works ) .",
    "unfortunately , such a level of understanding of the decoding failures has not been achieved for other important channels such as the bsc and the awgnc .    in this paper , we focus on the decoding failures of ldpc codes for iterative as well as lp decoders over the bsc and the awgnc",
    ". failures of iterative decoders for graph based codes were first studied by wiberg @xcite who introduced the notions of _ computation trees _ and _ pseudo - codewords_. subsequent analysis of the computation trees was carried out by frey _",
    "_ @xcite and forney _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "the failures of the lp decoder can be understood in terms of the vertices of the so - called _ fundamental polytope _ which are also known as pseudo - codewords @xcite .",
    "vontobel and koetter @xcite introduced a theoretical tool known as graph cover approach and used it to establish connections between the lp and the message passing decoders using the notion of the fundamental polytope .",
    "they showed that the pseudo - codewords arising from the tanner graph covers are identical to the pseudo - codewords of the lp decoder .",
    "vontobel and koetter @xcite also studied the relation between the lp and the min - sum decoders .    for iterative decoding on the awgnc ,",
    "mackay and postol @xcite were the first to discover that certain `` near codewords '' are to be blamed for the high error floor in the margulis code .",
    "richardson @xcite reproduced their results and developed a computation technique to predict the performance of a given ldpc code in the error floor domain .",
    "he characterized the troublesome noise configurations leading to the error floor using combinatorial objects termed trapping sets and described a technique ( of a monte - carlo importance sampling type ) to evaluate the error rate associated with a particular class of trapping sets .",
    "the method from @xcite was further refined for the awgnc by stepanov _",
    "@xcite who introduced the notion of _ instantons_. in a nutshell , an instanton is a configuration of the noise which is positioned in between a codeword ( say zero codeword ) and another pseudo - codeword ( which is not necessarily a codeword ) .",
    "incremental shift ( allowed by the channel ) from this configuration toward the zero codeword leads to correct decoding ( into the zero - codeword ) while incremental shift in an opposite direction leads to a failure . in principle",
    ", one can find this dangerous configuration of the noise by exploring the domain of correct decoding surrounding the zero codeword , and finding borders of this domain  the so - called error - surface .",
    "if the channel is continuous , the error - surface consists of continuous patches while configuration of the noise maximizing the error probability over a patch is called an instanton .",
    "the term instanton introduced initially in the context of disordered systems is also known under the names of _ saddle - point _ or _ optimal fluctuation _ , and is common in modern theoretical physics ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    as stated above",
    ", the instantons that affect the decoder performance in the error floor region are extremely rare , and hence identifying and enumerating them is a challenging task .",
    "however , once this difficulty is overcome , the knowledge of the trapping set / pseudo - codeword distribution can be used to evaluate the performance of the code .",
    "it can also be used to guide optimization of the code and design of improved decoding strategies . in this paper , we focus on the methods used to identify the most relevant noise configurations for various decoders and channel models .",
    "previous investigation of the problem include the work by kelley and sridhara @xcite who studied pseudo - codewords arising from graph covers and derived bounds on the minimum pseudo - codeword weight in terms of the girth and the minimum left - degree of the underlying tanner graph .",
    "the bounds were further investigated by xia and fu @xcite .",
    "smarandache and vontobel @xcite found pseudo - codeword distributions for the special cases of codes from euclidean and projective planes .",
    "pseudo - codeword analysis has also been extended to the convolutional ldpc codes by smarandache _",

    "@xcite proposed an algorithm to exhaustively enumerate certain trapping sets .",
    "chernyak _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and stepanov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite suggested to pose this problem of finding the instantons as a special optimization problem .",
    "this optimization method was built in the spirit of the general methodology , borrowed from statistical physics , guiding exploration of rare events which contribute the most to the ber / fer .",
    "the optimization method allowed to discover in @xcite , the set of most probable instantons for the awgnc and iterative decoder .",
    "the operational utility of the method was illustrated on some number of moderate size examples and dependence of the instanton structure on the number of iterations was observed .",
    "the general optimization method was substantially improved and refined in @xcite for the lp decoder over continuous channels ( with main enabling example chosen to be the awgnc ) . the pseudo - codeword - search ( pcs )",
    "algorithm of @xcite was essentially exploring in an iterative way the wiberg formula , treating an instanton configuration as a median between a pseudo - codeword and the zero - codeword .",
    "it was shown empirically that , initiated with a sufficiently noisy configuration , the algorithm converges to an instanton in sufficiently small number of steps , independent or weakly dependent on the code size .",
    "repeated multiple times , the method outputs the set of instanton configurations which can further be used to estimate the ber / fer performance in the transient and error floor domain .",
    "the definition of the instantons and the instanton search method were extended in @xcite to the bsc . in this special case ,",
    "the instanton search algorithm is provably efficient , in the sense that it outputs an instanton in small number of steps , and that the weight of the pseudo - codeword found in the intermediate steps is monotonically decreasing .",
    "( see also @xcite for an exhaustive list of references for this and related subjects . )    in this paper , we discuss failures of iterative decoders ( specifically the bp algorithm and the gallager a / b algorithms ) as well as lp decoding over the bsc and the awgnc .",
    "we explain the notion of instanton and elaborate on the connections between instantons and trapping sets as well as pseudo - codewords .",
    "we then describe algorithms to search for instantons . by using the @xmath0 $ ] tanner code @xcite as an enabling example ,",
    "we illustrate the performance of the instanton search technique outputting the set of most probable instantons . by identifying that all decoding failures can be attributed to the presence of certain subgraphs",
    ", we construct a code avoiding this subgraph and show that this code outperforms the original code . throughout the paper , we focus on the bsc and the awgnc and while the underlying approach is similar for both channels , rigorous statements can be made for the bsc @xcite , while the respective awgnc statements come from experiments only .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section2 ] , we introduce the notation and provide the required background material .",
    "the notions of decoding failures and instantons are discussed in section [ section3 ] , followed by a description of instanton search algorithms for different decoders in section [ section4 ] .",

    "ldpc codes belong to the class of linear block codes which can be defined by sparse bipartite graphs @xcite .",
    "the tanner graph @xcite @xmath1 of an ldpc code @xmath2 is a bipartite graph with two sets of nodes : the set of variable nodes @xmath3 and the set of check nodes @xmath4 .",
    "the check nodes ( variable nodes resp . )",
    "connected to a variable node ( check node resp . )",
    "are referred to as its neighbors .",
    "the set of neighbors of a node @xmath5 is denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "the degree @xmath7 of a node @xmath5 is the number of its neighbors .",
    "a vector @xmath8 is a codeword if and only if for each check node , the modulo two sum of its neighbors is zero .",

    "this code has length @xmath10 and rate @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the tanner graph is not uniquely defined by the code and when we say the tanner graph of an ldpc code , we only mean one possible graphical representation .",
    "we assume that a binary codeword @xmath15 is transmitted over a noisy channel and is received as @xmath16 .",
    "the support of a vector @xmath17 , denoted by @xmath18 , is defined as the set of all positions @xmath19 such that @xmath20 . in this paper",

    "the bp algorithm : * a soft - decision - decoding algorithm , which is the best possible one if the messages are calculated locally in the tanner graph of the code , is the bp algorithm ( also known as the sum - product algorithm ) . with a moderate abuse of notation",
    ", the messages passed in the bp algorithm are described below : @xmath54 the result of decoding after @xmath49 iterations , denoted by @xmath55 , is determined by the sign of @xmath56 . if @xmath57 then @xmath58 , otherwise @xmath59 .    in the limit of high snr ,",
    "when the absolute value of the messages is large , the bp algorithm becomes the min - sum algorithm , where the message from the check @xmath44 to the bit @xmath19 looks like : @xmath60    the min - sum algorithm has a property that the gallager a / b and the lp decoders also possess  if we multiply all the likelihoods @xmath61 by a factor , all the decoding would proceed as before and would produce the same result .",
    "note that we do not have this `` scaling '' in the bp algorithm .    to decode the message in complicated cases",
    "( when the message distortion is large ) we may need a large number of iterations , although typically a few iterations would be sufficient . to speed up the decoding process",

    "the ml - lp decoder finds @xmath63 minimizing the cost function @xmath64 subject to the @xmath65 constraint . the formulation is compact but impractical as the number of constraints is exponential in the code length .",

    "the lclp can fail , generating an output which is not a codeword .",
    "it is appropriate to mention here that the lclp can be viewed as the zero temperature version of bp - decoder looking for the global minimum of the so - called bethe free energy functional @xcite .",
    "to characterize the performance of a coding / decoding scheme for linear codes over any output symmetric channel , one can assume , without loss of generality , the transmission of the all - zero - codeword , i.e. @xmath79 , when the decoding algorithm satisfies certain symmetry conditions ( see definition 1 and lemma 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "the iterative decoding algorithms that we consider in this paper satisfy these symmetry conditions .",
    "the assumption of the transmission of the all - zero - codeword also holds for the lp decoding of linear codes on output symmetric channels , as the polytope @xmath74 is highly symmetric and looks exactly the same from any codeword ( see @xcite for proof ) .",
    "henceforth , we assume that @xmath79 .",
    "a decoding failure is said to have occurred if the output of the decoder is not equal to the transmitted codeword ( all - zero - codeword ) .",
    "probability of a decoder failure , or the frame error rate as a function of the snr @xmath80 can be expressed as : @xmath81 where the sum goes over all the possible outputs of the channel for the zero - codeword input . in case of a continuous output channel ,",

    "is a measure of the snr . for code rate @xmath88 and bpsk modulated transmission over the awgnc with noise variance @xmath89",
    ", we have @xmath90 . ]    calculating the above sum / integral exactly is not feasible , and the instanton - based approach consists of approximating the sum / integral by a finite number of terms corresponding to the most probable failures  the instantons .",
    "this approximation becomes asymptotically exact in the limit of large snr , while at smaller snrs , more terms are needed to obtain accurate approximation for the fer .",
    "note that the details of the approximate evaluations are different for discrete and continuous channels . in the discrete case ,",
    "the number of terms is finite .",
    "we account for the @xmath49-most probable configurations , and @xmath91 , where the multiplicity factor @xmath92 counts the number of instantons equivalent under bit permutations . for continuous channels ,",
    "an instanton is a stationary point of the respective integrand . by stationary point , we mean the local maximum of the noise probability density function .",
    "hence for the awgnc , instanton is defined as the noise configuration with minimal ( probably locally ) value of the @xmath93 norm of @xmath94 that leads to a decoding failure .",
    "the @xmath93 norm of a vector @xmath94 is equal to @xmath95 .",
    "note that for the awgnc , smaller the @xmath93 norm , the more probable the noise configuration is .",
    "the fer approximation should also include , in addition to the multiplicities , the curvature corrections around the stationary point ( e.g. within gaussian approximation ) @xcite .",
    "in other words , @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the curvature factor .",
    "the multiplicities of the instantons are determined by the symmetry group of the code , and if nothing is known about it , one may assume that the group is trivial and all multiplicities are equal to @xmath31 . in continuous case ,",
    "the curvatures are determined by the geometry of the error surface in the vicinity of the instanton ( this subject was not studied numerically so far , as the most important information about the instanton is its weight which determines the slope of fer _ vs. _ snr curve in the asymptotic ) .",
    "intuitively , in the case of the awgnc and @xmath98 , @xmath99 , the decay of the noise correlations is exponential along one direction ( orthogonal to the error surface ) and quadratic along the remaining @xmath100 components of the noise vector ( see fig .",
    "[ errorsurface ] for an illustration of the error surface ) .",
    "consistent with the above statements , instantons @xmath101 can be also defined as special configurations of the noise resulting in decoding failures such that any incremental ( and channel specific ) shift of the noise toward the zero - codeword results in correct decoding .",
    "it is thus useful to also introduce a respective output , @xmath102 , called a pseudo - codeword .",
    "it should be noted that this informal definition of the pseudo - codewords is generic and applicable to any channel and decoder . while the output for the lp decoder is well defined and does not suffer from numerical issues , the iterative decoder can exhibit oscillations i.e.",
    ", the bits which are decoded wrongly can differ from one iteration to another . as a way to streamline the description of decoding failures in the presence of rounding and iterative uncertainties ,",
    "richardson @xcite suggested a proxy notion of the trapping set , which is a combinatorial object that accounts for the decoder output over iterations .",
    "in the subsequent discussion , we formally define trapping sets and pseudo - codewords and also provide some bsc - specific definitions . if an instanton of a channel / decoder is known , the respective pseudo - codeword can be easily found , and conversely if a pseudo - codeword is given ( i.e. we know for sure that there exists a configuration of the noise which is sandwiched in between the pseudo - codeword and the zero - codeword ) the respective instanton can be restored . in fact , this inversion is in the core of the pseudo - codeword / instanton search algorithms discussed in section [ section4 ] .",
    "in practice , we assume that the iterative decoder performs a finite number @xmath103 of iterations .",

    "stated this way the problem of finding an instanton becomes an optimization problem , and all the remaining details of this section are related to efficient implementation of this , generally difficult , optimization problem .",
    "a straightforward optimization method for finding instantons in the case of a continuous channel is based on the standard ( amoeba ) optimization @xcite and was discussed by stepanov and chertkov in @xcite .",
    "the main idea of the direct technique is as follows .",
    "one draws randomly a unit length configuration of the noise and finds a scale - up value which positions the re - scaled configuration of the noise exactly at the error - surface .",
    "thus , incremental increase / decrease of the rescaling factor leads to decoding failure or recovery .",
    "such a configuration and its probability are recorded , and this operation is repeated @xmath152 times , thus generating @xmath100 vertices of a simplex with respective probabilities assigned . then , aiming to find a more probable point in the interior of the simplex , the current point is transformed according to the standard amoeba rules .",
    "the process is repeated until the size of the simplex becomes smaller than a preset accuracy , and the resulting most probable configuration outputs an instanton .",
    "the whole optimization is repeated multiple number of times , each time generating an instanton .",
    "the main advantage of the method is in its generality ( it can be used for any continuous channel and any soft decoding algorithm ) .",
    "however , implementing this method is costly . although one can use amoeba optimization method for lp decoding too , because of a certain property of lp decoding ( it is easy to find an instanton ( noise realization ) corresponding to the output of the decoding which is a pseudo - codeword ) , the pcs method described in section [ section4c ] is a lot more effective .",
    "the instanton - amoeba method easily finds the instantons for a code if the number of iterations in decoding is not large ( less than @xmath153 ) .",
    "increase of the number of iterations , @xmath154 , simply means longer computations .",
    "the other more important effect is associated with enhancement of irregular , stochastic component in decoding observed with @xmath154 increase .",
    "one finds that already a slight variation in the noise can drastically change results .",
    "that makes the function that we have to optimize very irregular , which dramatically slows down the optimization process .    in the case of large number of iterations in the decoder , with the check for a codeword in each iteration ,",
    "it is not easy to come up with good starting point for the amoeba .",
    "the configurations from amoeba with small number of iterations ( when the method is quite effective ) are not very useful as the decoder eventually outputs a codeword .",
    "the following two ways to find such configurations were developed .",
    "both are based on observations from numerical experiments .",
    "\\1 ) input an instanton for lp decoder to the min - sum iterative decoder .",
    "the instantons for lp decoding ( as they have low weight ) serve as good seeding noise configurations for amoeba , as they are in erroneous domain in noise space even for a decoder with a very large number of iterations .",
    "\\2 ) limit the noise configuration on bits where the instanton for low number of iterations is supported .",
    "work then with an optimization problem on these bits only , setting the noise value on all other bits to zero . in this way , the number of variables is much lower , so the optimization procedure is a lot easier to proceed with .",
    "the smaller is the dimension of the space in which the amoeba optimization is done , the easier is the problem .",
    "the instantons for low number of iterations usually have noise in a few bit locations .",
    "one can hope that if one increases the noise level on these selected bits ( while keeping the noise at all other bits being exactly zero ) then the noise configuration will `` survive '' a lot more iterations . the @xmath155 weight instanton ( supported by @xmath156 bits ) for awgnc and @xmath157 iterations decoder that is reported in @xcite was found this way .",
    "in contrast to iterative decoding with continuous alphabet , the trapping sets and instantons for the gallager a / b decoder can be found using certain combinatorial considerations which were first pointed out by richardson @xcite and later investigated in detail in @xcite .",
    "the trapping sets for gallager type decoders are closely related to trapping sets for the bit flipping decoders .      for the lp decoding over the awgnc , another suggestion for solving the difficult optimization problem faster was formulated in @xcite by chertkov and stepanov . this pseudo - codeword search ( pcs )",
    "algorithm , originally stated for the continuous channel model , is based on the aforementioned relation between instantons and respective pseudo - codewords . specifically , if a pseudo - codeword , @xmath158 corresponding to an instanton , is known , then reconstructing the respective instanton @xmath159 is equivalent to maximizing the probability of the noise under the condition that the probabilities of the noise configuration counted from the zero - codeword and from the pseudo - codeword , @xmath158 , are identical , i.e. @xmath160    the idea of the method of @xcite consists of throwing a sufficiently strong configuration of the noise ( so that the resulting decoding is erroneous ) , decode it into a pseudo - codeword , and then assume that the pseudo - codeword shares an error - surface with the zero - codeword .",
    "then the projected instanton is reconstructed using eq .",
    "( [ max_prob ] ) , even though the noise configuration , especially after the first iteration , is not an actual instanton .",
    "this procedure is repeated until the input and the output for an iteration give the same result .",
    "it was empirically shown in @xcite that such scheme formulated for the lp decoder outputs the sequence of noise configurations with probabilities monotonically increasing with the number of iterations and converging in a small number of iterations to an instanton .",
    "the pcs was extended to the case of lp decoding over the bsc by chilappagari _",
    "_ in @xcite .",
    "the algorithm proposed in @xcite termed as the instanton search algorithm ( isa ) is provably efficient and outputs an instanton in bounded number of steps .",
    "we summarize the algorithm below .",
    "+ : initialize to a binary input vector @xmath149 containing sufficient number of flips so that the lp decoder decodes it into a pseudo - codeword different from the all - zero - codeword .",
    "apply the lp decoder to @xmath149 and denote the pseudo - codeword output of lp by @xmath161 .",
    "+ : take the pseudo - codeword @xmath162 ( output of the @xmath163 step ) and calculate its median @xmath164 .",
    "apply the lp decoder to @xmath164 and denote the output by @xmath165 .",
    "only two cases arise :    * @xmath166 .",
    "then @xmath167 becomes the @xmath168-th step output/@xmath169 step input .",
    "* @xmath170 .",
    "let the support of @xmath164 be @xmath171 .",
    "let @xmath172 for some @xmath173 .",

    "apply the lp decoder to all @xmath174 and denote the @xmath176-output by @xmath177 . if @xmath178 , then @xmath164 is the desired instanton and the algorithm halts .",
    "else , @xmath179 becomes the @xmath168-th step output/@xmath169 step input .",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite for a discussion of various issues that arise in the implementation of the isa .",
    "this section summarizes statistics of instantons found for the @xmath0 $ ] tanner code @xcite performing over the bsc and the awgnc and decoded by iterative and lp decoders .",
    "the tanner code is a @xmath180 regular code whose tanner graph has girth @xmath181 @xcite .",
    "* gallager a algorithm : * the most dominant trapping set in the error floor domain is the @xmath182 trapping set which has critical number @xmath183 .",

    "[ instantonbscgala ] ) .",
    "there are @xmath185 @xmath186 trapping sets each with critical number @xmath187 .",
    "hence , the slope of the fer curve in the error floor region is dominated by the @xmath182 trapping sets and it is equal to @xmath183 . the trapping sets for the gallager a algorithm",
    "are found by a combination of simulations and combinatorial considerations ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "* iterative bp : * the instantons for 4 iterations decoder were analyzed by the instanton - amoeba method in @xcite .",
    "the 3 lowest instantons were found , all of which contained a specific characteristic 12 bit structure .",
    "it turns out that this bit structure is what is responsible for errors even for very large number of iterations @xcite .",
    "mc simulations show that the error floor asymptotic for the tanner code under iterative decoder with large number of iterations is determined by these structures ( resulting in effective distance of 12.45 @xcite ) .",
    "all the trapping sets corresponding to the lowest weight instantons contain an ( 8,2 ) trapping set which is shown in fig . [ instantonawgniterative ] . for more details on the fer curves for different number of iterations and relevant discussion ,",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite .    * lp decoder over bsc : * the isa described in section [ section4 ] found @xmath188 distinct instantons of size @xmath189 ( the corresponding pseudo - codewords have bsc weight @xmath190 ) . the support of each of these instantons is a @xmath182 trapping set shown in fig .",
    "[ instantonbsclp ] ( from the symmetry of the tanner code it can be verified that there are exactly @xmath188 such structures present in the tanner graph ) .",
    "the isa also discovered higher weight instantons ( see @xcite for more details ) , but the instantons of size @xmath189 are the most dominant ones in the error floor region .    * lp decoder over awgnc : * the pcs algorithm of @xcite found many low - weight pseudo - codewords ( @xmath191 being the least weight pseudo - codeword as found by the pcs ) .",
    "the weighted - median noise configurations ( instantons ) ( see @xcite ) corresponding to various low - weight pseudo - codewords have high noise at @xmath189 variable nodes corresponding to the @xmath182 trapping sets .",
    "in fact , the respective bsc weight @xmath190 pseudo - codewords have low weight on the awgnc also ( but not the absolute lowest ! ) . the support of each of the lowest - weight pseudo - codewords is large but the components in the variable nodes corresponding to the ( 5,3 ) trapping set have maximum value ( illustrated in fig . [ instantonawgnlp ] ) .",
    "an important insight gained from this comparison is that the decoding failures for various algorithms on different channels are closely related and are dependent on only a few topological structures .",
    "these relations can be exploited to find instantons for a given decoder on a given channel based on the knowledge of instantons for another already analyzed decoder , which can even be performing over another channel .",
    "this relation is also suggestive for design of a better code , the idea substantiated in the next subsection .      in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the minimum pseudo - codeword weight ( for lp decoding ) and the minimum critical number ( for gallager a / b decoding ) of a code increase with the increase in the girth of the underlying tanner graph .",
    "while girth optimized codes are known to perform better in general , the code length and degree distribution place a fundamental restriction on the best achievable girth . observing that the instantons for different decoding algorithms performing over different channels have a common underlying topological structure ( e.g. the @xmath182 trapping set in the case of the @xmath0 $ ] code ) ,",
    "it is natural to discuss design of a similar but new code which excludes these troublesome structures .",
    "in fact , this suggests a natural code optimization technique with an improved instanton distribution . starting with a reasonably good code ( constructed either algebraically or by the progressive edge growth ( peg ) method @xcite )",
    ", we find the most damaging instantons and their underlying topological structure .",
    "we then construct a new code avoiding such subgraphs ( either by swapping edges , by increasing code length , or utilizing a combination of both ) .",
    "we iterate this procedure till the code can no longer be optimized or reaching a computationally unbearable complexity .    for the gallager a decoding ,",
    "it has been proved in @xcite that codes with tanner graphs of girth @xmath181 which avoid the @xmath182 trapping set and weight @xmath181 codewords can correct all the error patterns of weight @xmath183 or less . while proving a similar result might be difficult for the iterative decoder over the awgnc and the lp decoder , such considerations nonetheless play a role in our code design strategy .",
    "an algorithm , suggesting construction of a code meeting the gallager a - related conditions , was provided in @xcite .",
