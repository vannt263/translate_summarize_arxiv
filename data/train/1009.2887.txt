    "the standard treatment of an inflationary scenario , as well as of dark energy , makes use of one or more real scalar fields , variously coupled to gravity and matter . on the other hand , from the point of view of quantum field theory ,",
    "such scalar fields can be taken to be either real or complex .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to get a deeper understanding of the transition from complex to real scalar fields , also contributing to implement the idea that the phase of a complex field characterizing the epoch of dark energy is practically constant , so that it may be set to zero safely .",
    "we will not try here to prove this result in general form , but in particular cases of wide interest . the general proof is postponed to future studies .    on the other hand , during the inflationary epoch",
    ", the phase should very rapidly be driven to be constant , if not already , so that the assumption of real fields would turn out to be justified .",
    "we shall give an example in which this is not entirely obtained , so that further investigation of this point also seems to be necessary .",
    "although there exists a large amount of literature concerning such kind of problems ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for example ) , here we want to look at things from a different point of view , adding new features and offering other examples for the discussion .",
    "furthermore , we do not enter at all into the domain of the open question whether there exists only a scalar field ( or many of them ) driving both inflationary and dark energy epochs or not , since we limit ourselves just to consider the two evolutionary stages as separated .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "another important feature of this work consists in the application of the noether symmetry approach to the problem .",
    "this procedure was applied for the first time by some of us @xcite in the context of a minimally coupled real scalar field . since then , a lot of different results were found in various situations ( as can be seen in ref .",
    "@xcite , for instance , just accounting for the first results only ) .    here",
    "we try to find a noether charge , for some suitable choice of the potential ruling one single scalar field .",
    "the first interesting result is that , by virtue of the phase and of the fact that the potential depends only on the modulus , there is always a trivial symmetry and a cyclic variable ( the same holds also for the hessence case ) .",
    "the associated charge ( below called @xmath0 ) was , on the other hand , already known ( see refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , the presentation which we give here seems to us more elegant both in terms of the procedure and the interpretation , and we shall make use of this constant in order to make most of our considerations . what is more interesting is the fact that , using the noether symmetry approach , we may prove that no other symmetry is found , except for the case @xmath1 , which indeed gives back the real case . since we have proved elsewhere @xcite that , in the real case , a class of symmetries does exist , we see that the more fundamental picture of a complex field breaks the symmetry , which may thus be obtained only as a limiting case , when the field becomes real .    in sec .",
    "ii , we sketch the basis of our problem and find a trivial noether charge . the following sec .",
    "iii is devoted to the possibility of determining other symmetries via the noether symmetry approach with an exponential potential , while sec .",
    "iv studies the equations of motion and the possibility to look at the presence of a complex scalar field as a sort of perturbation with respect to the real scalar field case , hence commenting on the numerical solution so found .",
    "this is done in the two separate situations of dark energy and inflation .",
    "section v studies the semiclassical quantum cosmology for the scalar - field potential obtained in sec .",
    "iv , with application to a better understanding of the conditions for inflation . finally , in sec . vi some conclusions are drawn .",
    "the observable universe and its large scale structure are usually considered to have their origins in an early inflationary stage . driven by a single scalar field , inflation in fact yields a distribution of adiabatic density perturbations capable to give an account of what we observe today in the large scale .",
    "on the other hand , string theory or other higher - dimensional field theories consider a number of scalar fields , which could all play a role during this early stage of evolution of the universe .",
    "this has of course to be taken into account when dealing with inflation and its consequences .",
    "even if considering only one scalar field can be considered as a good starting point to understand the main issues of many fundamental problems , for sake of completeness in what follows we sketch something about the possibility of considering more than one scalar field .",
    "because of the introductory type of discussion we are aiming to do , however , we then continue our treatment by using a single scalar field .",
    "inflationary dynamics and the spectrum of primordial perturbations are drastically affected by considering multiple scalar fields @xcite .",
    "for instance , unlike the single - field scenario , in such a case there appear also the nonadiabatic density perturbations , which could lead to detectable specific features in future observations .",
    "klein  gordon and friedmann equations with multiple ( non mutually interacting ) scalar fields labelled by @xmath2 s are written in the homogeneous and isotropic flat case as @xcite @xmath3 @xmath4 being the hubble parameter and @xmath5 the potential of the @xmath6-th scalar field . here , we are also assuming that the global potential energy is given by the sum of such single potentials , as @xmath7 since the hubble expansion is affected by the sum of all single potentials , it is thus clear that the overall field dynamics can be substantially changed in the presence of multiple scalar fields , even if the single potentials are not affected .",
    "there are , of course , different ways to consider many fields in inflation and we will not touch upon them here . see ref .",
    "@xcite for further comments and citations to literature .",
    "even if there is the possibility to reduce the background dynamics to an equivalent single field with only a potential @xcite , it is nevertheless important to stress again that there are meaningful differences between the scenario with multiple fields and the one with a single scalar field . while the evolution in the latter case can be shown to be independent of the initial conditions , the inflationary dynamics in the former may not .",
    "but , while keeping some distinct features of a multiple field scenario , it can anyway lead to observable predictions which may not depend on the initial conditions , as in nflation @xcite .    implementing the inflationary paradigm with many scalar fields",
    "has gained an increasing interest , since we are now facing a period of greater precision in cosmological observations , which allows the future possibility to discriminate between these various forms of inflationary stages .",
    "but , for what concerns us here , we shall return to the single field model in the following .",
    "it is easy to verify that the friedmann and klein  gordon equations for a spatially flat flrw metric and a complex scalar field @xmath8 may be derived from the following point lagrangian @xmath9 where we have used the metric signature @xmath10 and adopted the units in which @xmath11 , while @xmath12 are the real and imaginary parts of the field @xmath8 and @xmath13 is its modulus , so that one can write @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "it is important to point out that the lagrangian is the same in absence of matter , as well as , up to a constant , in its presence in the form of dust .",
    "the difference consists only in the value of the energy function associated , as usual , with @xmath16 @xmath17 which of course , in our case , should not be interpreted as the physical energy . in the case of vacuum @xmath18 vanishes , while in the case of dust @xmath19 , a value to be related to the present amount of matter , i.e. @xmath20 .",
    "the following arguments will be therefore applied in the two separate cases of inflation and dark energy , with suitable specifications when necessary . as already said , in fact",
    ", we do not want to enter into the realm of the unsolved problem of a unique scalar field , describing both the primeval era and the present accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "any relationship between the two fields present in such different cosmological stages is taken as inessential for our discussion , and we simply limit ourselves to consider the predominance of a complex scalar field in each one of the two epochs .    for our purposes , it is much better to introduce the phase @xmath21 so that the lagrangian becomes @xmath22 and we see at once that @xmath21 is cyclic .",
    "thus , we immediately obtain the conserved charge @xmath23 as expected .",
    "the minus sign is irrelevant , as @xmath24 will always appear in squared form , and we shall set @xmath25 .",
    "it is now clear what was stated in the introduction above : @xmath26 corresponds to the real case , for which we already have a large set of interesting results @xcite .    in order to look for other symmetries ,",
    "we need to make use of the charge obtained and reduce the degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "the procedure is exactly the same as in the case of a central potential in classical mechanics .",
    "first , we write the energy function @xmath27 and substitute for @xmath28 to obtain @xmath29 finally we have the reduced lagrangian @xmath30 it should be stressed that this expression for the lagrangian is _ not _ the same as the one obtained by direct substitution of eq .",
    "( 2.7 ) into @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "we have in fact reduced the configuration space of the problem from @xmath31 degrees of freedom ( @xmath32 ) to @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , as usual in this approach .",
    "we also observe that the system is now `` equivalent '' to that of a real field , endowed with an effective potential @xmath35 as already pointed out elsewhere ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , for example ) .",
    "the presence of the scale factor in @xmath36 substantially modifies the situation , and the field is now in a sense nonminimally coupled to gravity , although in a way which is not standard .",
    "this is of course due to the fact that the new lagrangian is not physical , but obtained as a result of a reduction procedure .",
    "let us now apply the standard procedure of the noether symmetry approach in order to establish nontrivial symmetries of @xmath37 .",
    "we look for a vector field on the reduced configuration space , properly lifted to the tangent space @xcite @xmath38 such that the lie derivative @xmath39 vanishes . here , the two functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 are unknown . by virtue of the linear dependence of @xmath42 on `` velocities '' and the quadratic ones of @xmath37 , a quadratic polynomial in @xmath43 , @xmath44 is obtained . since it must be identically zero , a set of four equations is finally derived , i.e. @xmath45 the first three equations are identical as in refs .",
    "@xcite , while the last one differs because of the presence of an effective potential , by virtue of the supposed complex nature of the scalar field .",
    "thus , proceeding along the very same lines , it is possible to find a general solution for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which however , when inserted into the last equation , turns out to be incompatible , unless @xmath1 ( in the latter situation , of course , a specified class of potentials is found @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus proved that , in the fully complex case , no nontrivial symmetry exists .",
    "it should be stressed that the potential has been simply viewed as a function of @xmath13 , but the same thing can be proved also while using a potential depending on @xmath48 , so covering the well known hessence case @xcite , for instance . as a matter of fact , in the latter situation one has @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 , so that @xmath52 .",
    "one then obtains the same set of eqs .",
    "( 3.2)(3.4 ) , while eq .",
    "( 3.5 ) is replaced by @xmath53 of course , this does not change the qualitative features of our previous results obtained from the noether symmetry approach . in the case",
    "@xmath1 , instead , we recover the real scalar field situation , where it is well known that a class of exponential potentials does the job @xcite . in particular , we shall now make use of the potential @xmath54 finding indeed a peculiar situation @xcite .",
    "we are in fact used to see that in quantum field theory some symmetries are generally found at a more fundamental level , which are subsequently broken during the evolution . here , on the contrary , assuming a potential of the form in eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) , we see that a complex field shows initially no symmetry .",
    "since @xmath55 , we have that , along with the growth of the scale factor with time , and provided that @xmath56 does not contemporarily go to zero very rapidly , @xmath57 should approach @xmath58 .",
    "the term with the initially nonvanishing @xmath0 then becomes negligible and , at least with very good approximation , the noether symmetry is recovered , in contrast with the usual expectation .",
    "it is now clear that @xmath0 can be regarded as a parameter , characterizing a perturbation term in @xmath37 . in this way",
    "the real scalar field corresponds to the _ unperturbed _ solution , while the phase of the complex scalar field gives rise to the _ perturbed _ solution .",
    "this point of view turns out to be particularly useful once an exact solution for the real scalar field is available .",
    "this being our case , let us first write , for the reduced lagrangian ( 2.10 ) , the euler ",
    "lagrange equations @xmath59 and the conservation of the energy function @xmath60 where , as we said , @xmath61 corresponds to the vacuum case . in this case ,",
    "an important consistency check is as follows .",
    "equation ( 4.1 ) , jointly with @xmath61 , yields @xmath62 for the time derivative of the hubble parameter , once that @xmath61 is used to re - express @xmath63 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath61 should have vanishing time derivative ( this corresponds to preservation in time of the hamiltonian constraint ) , and this yields again , upon expressing @xmath64 from the klein ",
    "gordon equation ( 4.2 ) , the formula for @xmath65 written above , since the additional contributions of @xmath66 occur with opposite signs and hence cancel each other exactly .    in what follows we shall first consider , due to its brevity , the dark energy situation and then the inflationary one .",
    "this gives no problem , since one has always to remember that we have not assumed here any relationship between the two scalar fields driving the two different stages of the cosmological evolution .",
    "let us , now , first consider an exact solution for the dark energy scenario . in the case",
    "@xmath1 , as said above , the exponential potential in eq . (",
    "[ 10 ] ) exhibits a noether symmetry .",
    "this allows exact integration of equations , as shown in refs .",
    "it is also possible to show that the solution fits very well with the snia data , as well as other tests @xcite .",
    "following the procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite we find it useful to set the unit of time to the age @xmath67 of the universe .",
    "this greatly simplifies notations and , above all , is of great help in numerical treatments , which are necessary when we go to the perturbed system . in these units",
    "@xmath68 turns out to be of order @xmath69 , and it is in fact convenient to set it exactly to @xmath69 . actually , this is not the best fit value , but very near , so that it can be considered appropriate for our purposes .",
    "other choices of the integration constants lead to @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , which are quite standard .",
    "the last constant fixes the present value of the scalar field @xmath72 . in the unperturbed system",
    ", however , this is quite arbitrary , since we are not able to observe it in any way . here , lies a problem : if , during the evolution of the unperturbed solution , one gets @xmath73 , the perturbing term diverges ! in order to avoid this pathology , we have set @xmath74 , which is not the same as in ref .",
    "@xcite , but appropriately shifted .    in light of all these assumptions ,",
    "the solution takes the very simple form @xmath75 where the value of @xmath20 obtained here is not the best fit one , by virtue of the simplified choice of @xmath68 .",
    "it is easy to check that the equations of motion are satisfied by this solution if @xmath1 .    with our choices , at @xmath67 all terms in the equations are of order @xmath69 , so that a small perturbation is obtained for @xmath76 . introducing this term",
    "now requires a numerical integration , which is performed starting from @xmath77 and integrating backwards .",
    "the choice of @xmath0 is of course arbitrary ; let us thus set @xmath78 , for example .",
    "the plot in fig .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) shows a comparison between the exact solution for the scale factor @xmath79 and the perturbed one in the case of the exponential potential above .     for the exponential potential given in eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) , in the dark - energy regime . ]",
    "it is clearly seen that the agreement is quite good for @xmath80 , as may be checked also by simple computation . before this time",
    ", something dramatic happens and a singularity is obtained for @xmath81 @xmath82 .",
    "this is of course due to the reduced value of the denominator in the perturbation term , which prevents this from being small .",
    "a computation of the redshift at the time when the discrepancy becomes visible gives @xmath83 , which is of course untenable .",
    "lowering the value of @xmath0 , would clearly push the discrepancies away , possibly up to an epoch when the model is not applicable .",
    "but this is in fact what we wanted to show .",
    "_ this dark energy model is viable only if the perturbing term is effectively negligible_. it is also clear that any unperturbed system , for which the term @xmath84 tends to zero in the past , will give similar results .",
    "thus , a better exploration of this possibility is needed .",
    "let us now move to a totally different situation , that is the earlier inflationary scenario .",
    "we want to see what happens if the perturbation term is applied to an exact solution describing primeval inflation .",
    "the general exact solution for the exponential potential in eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) can be easily specified to the new situation , but , unfortunately , what is then obtained is a power - law inflation , with behavior @xmath85 @xcite . as is well known , the spectrum of primordial perturbations for power - law inflation @xmath86 can be computed , and the spectral index is given approximately by @xmath87 so that the higher is the exponent @xmath88 , the nearer we are to the spectral index of the harrison ",
    "zeldovich spectrum @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath88 must be sufficiently large if we want to obtain @xmath89 , in agreement with wmap observations .",
    "thus , for the purpose of describing a more realistic situation , it is necessary to give up the noether symmetry , but we can anyway use an exact solution for the unperturbed system . it was shown long ago @xcite ( but see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) that a power - law behavior can be obtained as a particular solution from the potential @xmath90 so that @xmath91 where we note that the value of @xmath92 only fixes a shift in @xmath56 , which is on the other hand important in order to avoid singularities as above .    in this new situation , we have to fix again a suitable unit of time .",
    "a natural choice is to set the beginning of inflation at @xmath93 , i.e. , if we accept the usual estimate @xmath94 ( the planck time ) , we are restoring the usual planck units .",
    "let us also set @xmath95 , which gives a reasonable @xmath96 , and provides , for @xmath97 , an acceptable e - folding number @xmath98 .",
    "the small interval spanned by time is then good for the numerical integration .",
    "the last constant to be fixed is @xmath92 , which we can arbitrarily set to @xmath69 .",
    "it is again easy to find that , by setting @xmath61 into eqs .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) , and inserting eqs . ( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) into them , they are in fact verified .",
    "now , in order to introduce the perturbation , it is necessary to establish for which value of @xmath0 it turns out to be sufficiently `` small '' .",
    "a check of the terms in the equations at the initial point @xmath99 shows that now they are far from being of order @xmath69 .",
    "for instance , the modified klein ",
    "gordon equation gives at the initial point @xmath100 .",
    "this means that a value of , say , @xmath101 provides a small , but not entirely negligible , perturbation .",
    "on performing a numerical integration from @xmath93 to @xmath97 and plotting the percentage difference @xmath102 between the exact and perturbed solutions with respect to time @xmath103 , we obtain what is plotted in fig .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) .     between the exact and perturbed solutions for the exponential potential in the inflationary regime . ]",
    "this shows that such percentage difference is _ growing _ , even if slowly , up to @xmath104 .",
    "this is clearly small , but we have to remember that we started from a small perturbation . as a matter of fact , taking a larger value like @xmath105 allows the difference to grow up to about @xmath106 .    on the basis of this result we might conclude that the treatment of inflation by means of a real scalar field would be a rather crude approximation . in fact , this is not the case , because what is really important is to check that the phase of the scalar field is nearly constant at the end of inflation , even starting from a different situation .    in order to do that , let us revert to eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , from which we get @xmath107 such that @xmath108 where @xmath109 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "let us note here a subtle point .",
    "after examining the behavior of @xmath110 , we see that it is not dimensionless , which would force us to multiply it by an appropriate time scale . on the other hand , with our units ,",
    "this time scale is actually of order @xmath69 , so that the result we would then get is numerically the same as the one already deduced .",
    "another point is more delicate . to comment on it",
    ", we shall use the exact unperturbed solution in the following computation .",
    "this is justified by the fact that , as just shown ( fig .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) ) , it is only slightly different from the perturbed one .",
    "surprisingly enough , the integral in eq .",
    "( 4.14 ) can be performed in terms of a special function , i.e. @xmath111 where @xmath24 now indicates summation and @xmath112 , while @xmath113 is the exponential integral function . in order to determine the integration constant @xmath109",
    ", it is possible to set the initial phase to @xmath69 , for instance .",
    "this means that the imaginary and real parts of the field are of the same order , or even larger , without substantial changes . by introducing the above numbers for the parameters , we get @xmath114 and @xmath115 , showing a dramatic fall  off",
    "the situation is illustrated by the behavior of @xmath116 shown in fig .",
    "( [ f3 ] ) .    .",
    "]      in this subsection , we are aiming to show that the situation can be even more complicated , with some subtleties which do not appear in what depicted above .",
    "for this purpose we present a toy model , which has the advantage of being simple and suitable for illustrating our claim .",
    "thus , let us consider the unperturbed equations and assume that the evolution of @xmath56 is given by @xmath117 . from the well known relation @xmath118 it is possible to derive @xmath119 and",
    "it is also possible to arrive at the potential @xmath120 it is then easy to check that @xmath121 in ( 4.18 ) is again a special exact solution .",
    "we have now @xmath122 so that @xmath28 goes to infinity with time in this case ( see fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) . as a matter of fact",

    "the expression of eq .",
    "( 4.17 ) is clearly inflationary for small @xmath103 , because @xmath124 so that inflation actually ends at @xmath125 . here",
    ", it has been allowed to start from the very beginning , in such a way that , the time scale being arbitrary , there is no problem with the e - folding number . on the other hand",
    ", our formula for the scale factor leads to @xmath126 which is clearly unphysical , but we already acknowledged that it is only a toy model , which should be anyway taken more seriously into account only until the end of inflation .",
    "let us now consider the perturbed system . on going back to eq .",
    "( 4.1 ) we see that , for very small @xmath127 , the term containing @xmath0 can dominate and there is no inflation . in order to verify this ,",

    "lagrange equations backwards in time . by assuming @xmath128",

    "we see that indeed now one has a natural way for the beginning of inflation .",
    "this sounds interesting , but it is also clear that the duration is now too much shortened , and the e - folding turns out to be of order @xmath69 ! of course , it is possible to improve the situation by taking a much smaller value for @xmath0 , so small that it is impossible to perform a numerical integration .",
    "this is a sort of fine tuning on the phase which should be investigated further .",
    "eventually , we now go beyond the end of inflation , to the future of @xmath130 . in fig . 6",
    "a double surprise is now obtained .",
    "first , we obtain a new limited period of accelerated expansion .",
    "this suggests , confirming in part what was found before in sec .",
    "iv , that a complex scalar field might emulate dark energy , but of course this statement should be supported with much deeper investigation .",
    "second , we obtain a singularity at @xmath131 . it is not clear whether this is due to numerical integration problems . of course , a choice of a much smaller value for @xmath0 would push these features to the right . but",
    "this is even more interesting because , by virtue of the time scale here adopted , this is just what is needed .    , showing a short period of accelerated expansion after the end of inflation , with a possible singularity at a certain time . ]",
    "since we have just found a strong motivation for studying the somewhat unusual potential in eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) , we now take it again into account from a complementary point of view , i.e. , the semiclassical approximation in quantum cosmology . for the basic references on this vast subject , and for a detailed discussion of the main issues , we refer the reader to refs .",
