    "<S> the study of off - equatorial orbits in razor - thin disks is still in its beginnings . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to what was presented in the literature in recent publications , the vertical stability criterion for equatorial circular orbits can not be based on the vertical epicyclic frequency , because of the discontinuity in the gravitational field on the equatorial plane . </S>",
    "<S> we present a rigorous criterion for the vertical stability of circular orbits in systems composed by a razor - thin disk surrounded by a smooth axially symmetric distribution of matter , the latter representing additional structures such as thick disk , bulge and ( dark matter ) halo . </S>",
    "<S> this criterion is satisfied once the mass surface density of the thin disk is positive . </S>",
    "<S> qualitative and quantitative analyses of nearly equatorial orbits are presented . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the analysis of nearly equatorial orbits allows us to construct an approximate analytical third integral of motion in this region of phase - space , which describes the shape of these orbits in the meridional plane .    </S>",
    "<S> the literature on analytical models for disklike galaxies is vast ( see , for instance , ref .  ) . </S>",
    "<S> although most disk galaxies contain internal structures such as bars , warps and spiral arms @xcite , we can gain a deep insight about the orbital dynamics of stars in these systems by modeling them as axisymmetric . </S>",
    "<S> this is a standard procedure to model , for instance , rotation curves of spiral galaxies . in this framework , </S>",
    "<S> a given rotation curve is usually fitted by an axisymmetric mass model decomposition into a stellar disk , a gaseous disk , a central bulge and a dark matter halo . by assuming a constant mass - to - light ratio along the galaxy , it is possible to determine the density profiles of the disks by photometry@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> there is one extra aspect which must be considered in modeling rotation curves of disk galaxies : the corresponding mass models must give rise to stable circular orbits in the disk s equatorial plane . </S>",
    "<S> if we consider a smooth 3d distribution of matter , the stability analysis follows from taylor expanding the effective potential up to second order in the vincinity of the circular orbit @xcite , which is stable if the epicyclic frequencies @xmath0 ( radial ) and @xmath1 ( vertical ) are real . </S>",
    "<S> however , many galaxy models in the literature are composed by a razor - thin disk . </S>",
    "<S> although in this case radial stability of circular orbits is analyzed as above , vertical stability can not be analyzed by second - order taylor expansion . </S>",
    "<S> this happens because of the discontinuity in the vertical component of the gravitational field , due to the surface layer of matter in the equatorial plane . in this contribution </S>",
    "<S> we briefly present the results of our recent work @xcite concerning the vertical stability of circular orbits in newtonian razor - thin disks . </S>",
    "<S> after presenting the basics of razor - thin disk modeling , we comment on the new vertical stability criterion , which is consistent with the delta - like singularity in the density field . </S>",
    "<S> adiabatic approximation permits us to construct an approximate third integral of motion for nearly equatorial orbits in these systems , which describes the shape of the corresponding 3d orbits in the @xmath2 plane . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , we expect that the formalism presented here can also contribute to the `` third integral of motion '' issue @xcite , as well as to the analysis of orbits in piecewise - smooth dynamical systems . </S>",
    "<S> concerning this last topic , we remark that , as far as we know , there is no analogue of the kam theorem which is valid for systems with this kind of discontinuity . </S>",
    "<S> however , the literature on disk - crossing orbits presents a large amount of numerical evidence in which islands of stability appear in the vicinity of a stable fixed point @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the density profile is described as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the dirac delta distribution , @xmath5 is smooth and the system has reflection symmetry with respect to @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the physical interpretetion of the above quantities is the following : @xmath7 is the surface mass density profile of the razor - thin disk and @xmath8 represents all the remaining three - dimensional structures , such as thick disk , bulge and ( dark matter ) halo . for an equatorial circular orbit of radius @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> , we found @xcite that the condition which must substitute the vertical frequency stability condition is @xmath10 the radial stability condition is the same as in 3d disks , i.e. , @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath12 and @xmath13 imply ( liapunov ) stability of the corresponding circular orbit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the vertical stability condition presented here is satisfied along the whole region of the equatorial plane which contains the surface layer of matter . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , every equatorial circular orbit in an axially symmetric razor - thin disk model is vertically stable by construction , regardless of the shape of the remaining components of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> the procedure considered so far in the literature to analyze vertical stability of circular orbits in analytical models of razor - thin disks took into account the vertical epicyclic frequency criterion @xcite , neglecting the term proportional to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this led to the conclusion that some models contain regions with vertically unstable circular orbits@xcite . a suggested solution to this problem was to consider , in addition to the razor - thin disk , thick disks or spheroidal halos in order to guarantee vertical stability @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , as described in the preceding paragraph ( and discussed in detail in ref .  ) , this is not the case . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of 3d distributions of matter does not affect vertical stability in such systems . </S>",
    "<S> radial stability , though , is affected by the off - equatorial density profile @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> concerning nearly equatorial orbits close to a stable equatorial circular orbit with given @xmath14 component of angular momentum , adiabatic invariance of the approximate hamiltonian describing vertical motion near the circular orbit ( with @xmath15 acting as an external time dependence in the corresponding potential ) gives us the following relation @xcite for the shape of nearly equatorial orbits in the meridional plane : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the maximum value of @xmath14 that the star reaches along the whole trajectory , for each given value of @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> this expression represents an approximate third integral of motion for the system in the phase - space region under consideration , and depends only on the density distribution of the razor - thin disk . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of this relation was checked numerically in ref .   for a kuzmin thin disk and a kuzmin disk superposed by a plummer halo , with good agreement near the equatorial plane ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : k ] for orbits in kuzmin s potential ) . </S>",
    "<S> this approximate third integral of motion may be a starting point to apply canonical perturbation theory to integrable hamiltonian systems containing razor - thin disks . </S>"
