    "how can altruism arise through darwinian evolution of the fittest ?",
    "why does a bee kill itself but saves many other bees by stinging a large predator ?",
    "this question worried biologists as well as physicists since a long time @xcite . here",
    "we check if the penna ageing model , suitably modified , allows for self - organization of altruism in the sense that the old make sacrifices for the young , or the young for the old .",
    "the penna bitstring model @xcite is based on medawar s half - century old mutation - accumulation hypothesis : dangerous mutations killing an organism in young age will not be transmitted to future generations , while those affecting old age will be given on to the offspring .",
    "this model gave good agreement with the exponential increase of mortality at middle age ( gompertz law ) .",
    "an alternative theory is antagonistic pleiotropy @xcite , where the same mutation has beneficial effects in young age but detrimental effects in old age , like enhanced calcium intake producing bones for the young and arteriosclerosis for the old .",
    "antagonistic pleiotropy was already combined with the penna ageing model for different purposes @xcite ; here we use it to explain altruism . a somewhat similar theory",
    "@xcite explained the shorter life expectancy of men compared with women by testosterone , which makes men more aggressive to protect their family ; we like this heroic interpretation better than explanations due to too much alcohol and steaks . in the next section",
    "we define our models , followed by a section of results .",
    "we start with the standard asexual penna model program listed in @xcite and discuss here only the changes .",
    "the verhulst deaths , due to the lack of food and space in densely populated ecosystems , were restricted to the newborn @xcite to make the model more realistic ; an additional death probability @xmath3 at every time step kills individuals of all ages ; initially @xmath4 is set to an age - independent input parameter @xmath5 .    at every iteration a new type of inheritable mutations occurs : randomly @xmath6 is changed by an amount @xmath7 for young age and by the opposite amount @xmath8 for old age .",
    "the sign of @xmath9 is determined randomly for each individual at each time step , with equal probabilities for positive and negative signs .",
    "the absolute value @xmath10 is fixed as the input parameter @xmath11 .",
    "the summation of the many mutations of @xmath6 leads to a probability difference @xmath12 , which is twice the change in the death probability @xmath6 .",
    "thus a positive @xmath13 means that the old sacrifice their lifes for the young , with a certain probability .",
    "( mutations violating the requirement @xmath14 were ignored . )",
    "the minimum reproduction age was taken as 8 age units , and thus `` young '' was defined as having an age below an input parameter @xmath15 , while old individuals had an age above @xmath16 ; typically , @xmath17 .",
    "after 2000 iterations the total population as well as the average probability difference @xmath13 barely changed anymore , and we stopped the simulation ; in one case this stabilization was confirmed by ten times more iterations .",
    "this was our first model .",
    "a second model assumed the above additional probability @xmath4 not to change with time ( no mutations for @xmath4 ) ; instead if a young individual is supposed to die because of this fixed probability @xmath18 , it tries to find an old individual which then dies instead of the young one .",
    "the young individual is allowed up to 20 consecutive attempts to find , by randomly selecting one of the existing individuals , one victim old enough to take its place on death row .",
    "fig.1 shows the emergence of altruism in the sense of the first model : with suitable parameters we mostly found the old ones to sacrifice their lives for the young , i.e. @xmath19 .",
    "however , one of the simulations shown there gives negative @xmath13 where the young die for the old . in this figure we varied @xmath20 and @xmath11 as shown in the headline , and kept @xmath21 the same .",
    "fig.2 shows that varying the limits @xmath15 and @xmath16 for young and old age changes the results much less than varying @xmath20 and @xmath11 in fig.1 .",
    "our second model for the above parameters is bad for altruism ; simulations with and without altruism under otherwise identical conditions showed altruism to diminish and not to enhance the population , at best we could achieve that it did not change the population size for long times . * acknowledgements * we thank the european science foundation for supporting the visit of ds via cost - p10 , and fundacja na rzecz nauki polskiej for supporting sc .",
