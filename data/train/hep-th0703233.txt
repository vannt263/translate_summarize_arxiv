    "all indications suggest that the bekenstein - hawking entropy of a black hole s_bh= a 4l_p^2 is true thermodynamic entropy@xcite .",
    "( here @xmath2 is the area of the horizon and @xmath3 the planck length . ) at the microscopic level it must therefore correspond to the logarithm of the number of thermodynamically relevant states .",
    "one can write down a formal path integral expression for the partition function and entropy of the quantum gravitational statistical ensemble@xcite , which in the classical approximation yields precisely this entropy , however the microscopic nature of the states thereby counted remains obscure .",
    "it would appear that an unavoidable contribution to the entropy budget is the entanglement entropy @xmath4 across the horizon of quantum fields propagating on the black hole background@xcite .",
    "the entanglement entropy arises from the spacelike correlations in the freely falling vacuum ( giving rise to hawking radiation ) , on account of which the restriction to the region outside the horizon is a mixed state .",
    "this can also be thought of as entropy of the thermal atmosphere of the black hole@xcite , particularly referring to the near - horizon region where most of the entropy is localized .",
    "it is difficult to see any rationale for omitting the entanglement / atmosphere entropy .",
    "however , in the standard semiclassical evaluation it diverges due to the infinite density of states at the horizon .",
    "one can only conclude that the divergence in @xmath4 must be somehow cut off by quantum gravity effects .",
    "a simple dimensional analysis of the geometry suggests that when cut off at planck scale , the entanglement entropy across the horizon will scale as @xmath5 , just like the bekenstein - hawking entropy .",
    "if so , then @xmath4 would make an important contribution to @xmath6 .",
    "this presents a  species problem , \" since @xmath4 depends on the number and nature of quantum fields , whereas the bekenstein - hawking entropy is _ universally _ given by @xmath7 .",
    "a natural solution to this problem may exist however@xcite : the value of the planck length @xmath8 appearing in @xmath6 involves the low energy gravitational constant @xmath9 , whose value should depend , though renormalization effects , on the quantum matter fields .",
    "the shift of @xmath10 produced by the matter fields could induce a shift of @xmath6 that corresponds precisely to @xmath4 .",
    "the formal arguments of refs .",
    "@xcite support this possibility , as do explicit regularized computations for free field theory such as in  @xcite .",
    "however , mismatches seem to arise for contributions of vector fields  @xcite and in odd dimensional spacetimes  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "very general arguments  @xcite indicate that if one focuses not on entanglement entropy but only on the contribution of matter to the entropy derived from the thermal partition function for gravity plus matter ( which may be the same thing in some cases ) , then the relation between black hole entropy and renormalization of @xmath9 is universal . a purely thermodynamic argument",
    "@xcite suggests the even stronger statement that @xmath9 is wholly determined by the entropy of local rindler horizons .",
    "previous studies of black hole entanglement entropy with a physically motivated regulator ( as opposed to a technical regulator such as pauli - villars ) have adopted a cutoff scheme where a highest momentum @xcite or shortest distance @xcite was imposed in the static frame . in both cases",
    "it was found that the entropy scales as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the cutoff length .",
    "however , the equivalence principle suggests that if there is a cutoff on the freely falling vacuum imposed by quantum gravity it should be physically determined in a freely falling frame .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the nature of the regulated entanglement entropy when a freely falling momentum cutoff @xmath13 is imposed .",
    "we shall consider both a hard momentum cutoff , and a cutoff imposed by the introduction of dispersion at high wavevectors , and we carry out the analysis using wkb methods .",
    "we find that unlike what is found in the static frame , the entropy scales linearly with the cutoff as @xmath14 for a hard cutoff , and with a similar but more complicated scaling law in the case of dispersion . in this expression",
    "@xmath15 is the surface gravity measured in the freely falling frame in which @xmath13 has been defined .",
    "when that frame is at rest at infinity , @xmath15 reduces to the standard surface gravity .",
    "a surprising conclusion may be drawn from our results .",
    "if the freely falling cutoff @xmath13 is identified with the planck mass , then the regulated entanglement entropy is negligibly small compared to the bekenstein - hawking entropy for macroscopic black holes .",
    "this would provide a different resolution to the species problem mentioned above ( unless the number of species were of order @xmath16 ) . on the other hand , as argued in @xcite , it is also possible that the cutoff arises from quantum gravitational effects in the black hole background , and that its value equals the planck mass when measured in the _",
    "static _ frame .",
    ", as suggested in  @xcite , then the question arises whether the entropy is cut off at this scale or instead if the cutoff  floats \" with the fluctuations .",
    "] such a cutoff would appear as @xmath17 in the free - fall frame , and the regulated entropy would be of order @xmath5 after all .",
    "we shall return to a discussion of this issue at the end of the paper .",
    "whatever the regularization scheme one chooses , the divergence in the entanglement entropy can be traced to two distinct sources .",
    "first , the density of modes at fixed frequency and angular momentum diverges due to an infinite number of oscillations as the horizon is approached .",
    "second , there is the sum over all angular momenta . in our approach",
    ", we find that in the case of both the hard cutoff and dispersion the wkb mode density is regulated . in effect",
    ", the dispersion introduces a maximum radial wave number contributing to the thermal atmosphere of the black hole .",
    "we further find that the mode density vanishes at a finite angular momentum in the case of a hard cutoff or super - luminal dispersion , while it decreases to zero asymptotically at large angular momenta in the sub - luminal case .",
    "the angular momentum sum is therefore finite in the former cases , while in the latter case it depends on the dispersion at asymptotically large momenta and can not be determined within the wkb approximation because of the asymptotically vanishing mode density .",
    "the effect of sub - luminal dispersion on entanglement entropy has been previously investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite . there",
    "the dispersion was introduced in the static ( accelerated ) frame of the black hole , rather than in the freely falling frame . in that case",
    ", there is a piling up of transplanckian modes at some radius greater than the horizon radius , so the mode density at fixed angular momentum remains infinite and therefore the entropy diverges .",
    "this is not the result reported in @xcite , where it was instead concluded that the entropy is finite .",
    "we believe this conclusion was based on an incorrect evaluation of the entropy .    in following sections of this paper",
    "we first review the nature of the divergent entanglement entropy in the usual relativistic case .",
    "next we introduce a hard momentum cut - off in the freely falling frame and analyze how it regulates the divergences .",
    "finally we introduce dispersion at high momenta also in the freely falling frame , and analyze its impact on the divergences of the entanglement entropy .",
    "a long appendix provides details on the field modes , the entangled , thermal nature of the free fall vacuum , and the wkb evaluation of the mode density governing the entanglement entropy .",
    "we consider nonrotating , static black hole spacetimes and adopt painlev - gullstrand ( pg ) coordinates since they are adapted to the free - fall frame in which the momentum cutoff or dispersion will be introduced .",
    "a free - fall frame is defined by a family of radial infalling geodesics all with the same velocity at infinity .",
    "the corresponding pg line element in four dimensions takes the form ds^2 = d^2 -(d - v()d)^2 -r()^2 ( d^2 + ^2d^2 ) , [ ds2 ] in units with the speed of light @xmath18 ( see e.g. ref .",

    "the entropy diverges for two independent reasons .",
    "first , for each fixed @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the mode density has a uv divergence logarithmic in the radial momentum cut - off .",
    "this arises from the infinite number of mode oscillations caused by the infinite blue shift at the horizon .",
    "secondly , the sum over angular momenta is unbounded , producing a uv divergence quadratic in the angular momentum .",

    "we are interested in regulating the atmosphere entropy by modifying the field propagation at high momenta as defined in a freely falling frame .",
    "this is in contrast to t hooft s  brick wall \" approach  @xcite to regulating the entropy , where the cut - off is defined on static time slices .",
    "we first consider the simple case of a hard momentum cut - off .    since the momentum cut - off is stationary and spherically symmetric , the atmosphere entropy still has the form ( [ satmo ] ) .",

    "+ _ frame dependence_had we imposed the cut - off @xmath13 in a general free - fall frame the result would have been the same as ( [ scut ] ) , except with @xmath32 replaced by @xmath15 defined in ( [ kappa ] ) or equivalently ( [ kvk ] ) .",
    "thus the entropy actually depends on the free - fall frame in which the cut - off is defined .",
    "this is to be expected , since the cut - off prescription is not lorentz invariant .",
    "+ _ universal dependence on transverse momentum cutoff_although the entropy depends on the free - fall frame adopted for the cut - off @xmath13 , it scales universally with the maximum angular momentum as _",
    "max^2~a |p^2_max , with @xmath87 the value of @xmath88 ( [ pmax ] ) evaluated at @xmath89 ( where most of the entropy resides ) .",
    "thus each unit of area @xmath90 carries of order one bit of entropy .",
    "put differently , the entropy scales as the number of angular momentum states below the cutoff .",
    "the same scaling is found in the case of a dispersive cutoff in the next section .",
    "+ _ near - horizon approximation_as explained after ( [ pt ] ) , the near - horizon approximation is justified for modes with @xmath91 .",
    "we can now see that this is satisfied for the dominant modes , since @xmath92 .",
    "+ _ anisotropy of momentum cutoff_since @xmath93 is much smaller than the cut - off @xmath13 , the entropy would be unchanged were the cut - off @xmath13 imposed isotropically on the norm of the momentum rather than on the radial component alone .",
    "+ _ mode density for dominant angular momenta_since the entropy scales as the number of angular momentum states , the number of modes contributing to the entropy at fixed angular momentum @xmath94 is of order one for the dominating values of @xmath50 .",
    "indeed , evaluating the mode density ( [ ncut ] ) for @xmath73 parametrized as a fraction of the maximum value , @xmath95 , yields @xmath96 . since thermal suppression by the boltmann factor",
    "limits the effective frequency range to @xmath97 , the number of contributing modes is @xmath98 .",
    "since most of the entropy comes from @xmath99 close to unity , only a  fraction of a mode \" contributes for each angular momentum . in this regime @xmath100",
    "should be interpreted as the _ probability _ to find the corresponding particle in the atmosphere outside the horizon .",
    "+ _ comparison with  brick wall \" model_the entropy ( [ scut ] ) scales as @xmath101 , linearly with the momentum cutoff @xmath13 .",
    "this scaling differs from that of the entropy regulated with a  brick wall \" cutoff  @xcite , i.e. a reflecting boundary condition at a proper distance @xmath12 from the horizon , which scales quadratically as @xmath102 .",
    "the difference arises only because different frames have been used to measure the cutoff scales : we measured @xmath13 on a time slice orthogonal to the free - fall worldlines , whereas @xmath12 was measured in ref .",
    "@xcite along a static time slice , orthogonal to the killing vector . on the free - fall time slice ,",
    "the same brick wall lies at a much smaller proper distance @xmath103 from the horizon .",
    "hence when expressed in terms of @xmath104 , the brick wall entropy scales as @xmath105 , in agreement with what we found .    the agreement in overall scaling with the cutoff is a feature of the total entropy , after integrating over all frequencies and transverse momenta .",
    "this agreement arises because the dominant contributions scale the same way , despite the fact that the physical nature of the two cutoffs is different .",
    "in particular , the brick wall cuts off all modes at the same _ location _ , whereas we cut off all modes at the same _ momentum_. in our case the cutoff location is not sharp , but can be characterized using the wkb approximation .",
    "its value then depends on the frequency and angular momentum .",
    "the angular momentum dependence is negligible because , as noted after equation ( [ pmax ] ) , @xmath106 for the frequencies @xmath107 that dominate the total entropy .",
    "the frequency dependence on the other hand is significant . using the dispersion relation ( [ reldisp ] ) one finds near the horizon @xmath108 , so that the wkb position cutoff is @xmath109 .",
    "however , this @xmath80 dependence does not affect the total entropy scaling since frequencies much greater than @xmath32 are thermally suppressed .",
    "a further negligible difference with the brick wall evaluation arises because we cut off the wkb trajectories at the final horizon crossing , whereas the brick wall trajectories begin and end at the same radius , as explained in more detail in the appendix .",

    "as can be verified a posteriori , this approximation is valid in the present context , as in the hard cutoff case .",
    "moreover , the @xmath127 dependence in @xmath128 can be safely replaced by the constant value @xmath129 .    as before we take the field to be in the free fall vacuum state .",
    "a num- ber of studies have demonstrated that in this state , to leading order in @xmath130 , models with uv dispersion reproduce the relativistic result that the outgoing modes at infinity are thermally populated at the hawking temperature  @xcite . to evaluate the entanglement entropy we need to know whether thermality extends to the near - horizon modes that contribute to the entropy . in the appendix",
    "we deduce the quantum field theoretic description of the near - horizon free fall vacuum , generalizing to four dimensions the treatment of ref .",
    "the state is a product of two - mode squeezed states that are thermal when reduced to one mode .",

    "as in the relativistic case , the wavevector @xmath68 corresponds to the point where the particle trajectory finally crosses the horizon . in the wkb approximation ,",
    "the _ only _ place where the dispersion enters the calculation of the atmosphere entropy is in the determination the initial wavevector @xmath67 .    in the super - luminal case",
    "the outgoing positive frequency modes emerge from behind the horizon after parting ways with their negative frequency partners which always remain behind the horizon ( see fig .  [ trajectories ] ) .",
    "therefore the relevant trajectory for determining the density of states to be included in the entropy extends between the two horizon crossing points of the positive frequency trajectory , and @xmath67 is the value of @xmath132 at the first ( outward ) horizon crossing .",
    "the mode density at fixed @xmath49 and @xmath50 is thus finite , and the sum over @xmath50 is cut off when the turning point drops below the horizon and the two horizon crossing points merge .",
    "the atmosphere entropy is thus finite .",
    "we now discuss the determination of @xmath67 in the sub - luminal case , before computing the entropy for both cases together .",
    "in the sub - luminal case , the positive and negative frequency outgoing modes are initially infalling with respect to the static frame . for high enough frequency or low enough angular momentum the positive frequency modes",
    "convert to outward propagation at a turning point just outside the horizon ( see fig .  [ trajectories ] ) , followed by a second turning point at the angular momentum barrier where they begin to fall back in . for lower frequency or higher angular momentum",
    "the pair of turning points disappears and the particle just follows the partner straight across the horizon with a small time lag . since the entanglement of these modes is the source of the entropy , we shall identify @xmath133 the value of @xmath132 for the positive frequency particle at the time the negative frequency partner crosses the horizon , leaving the particle stranded outside .",

    "hence @xmath262 yields a positive norm mode if @xmath263 , while @xmath264 yields a negative norm mode . taking into account the normalization factor of each of these modes ,",
    "the annihilation operator for ( [ phi+ ] ) with @xmath265 thus decomposes as .",
    "[ abc]that is , it is a combination of the annihilator of the @xmath266 mode and the creation operator for the complex conjugate of the @xmath267 mode , which is a positive norm mode with killing frequency @xmath226 . when @xmath268 , one finds ( [ abc ] ) with @xmath269 and @xmath270 interchanged , and @xmath80 replaced by @xmath226 .",
    "the condition that the annihilator for ( [ phi+ ] ) ( for all @xmath80 ) annihilates the state thus becomes a statement that the state contains correlated pairs of @xmath271 particles with opposite killing frequency .",
    "tracing over the negative killing frequency particles yields a thermal state at the hawking temperature @xmath44 .",
    "thus , even in the dispersive case , the near horizon free fall vacuum has a thermal character .    with vanishing angular momentum and no dispersion , these correlated pairs are strictly localized , with the positive killing frequency one outside and the negative killing frequency one inside the horizon .",
    "with angular momentum added , the positive killing frequency mode falls back across the horizon with a low radial momentum . with dispersion , there is a further blurring of the outside / inside distinction which this time comes from the uv domain . nevertheless ,",
    "because @xmath272 there exists an intermediate domain @xmath273 wherein ( [ plusminus ] ) can be used to define a decomposition into a correlated pair of positive and negative killing frequency modes which are localized on either side of the horizon . moreover , when wavepackets are formed by integrating over @xmath80 , those wavepackets will spend some time near the horizon behaving as do the ones with no angular momentum and no dispersion .",
    "the amount of time the one with positive @xmath80 will spend outside the horizon while its partner is inside is ( by definition ) given by ( [ ndtapp ] ) .    indeed , in identifying the modes contributing to entanglement entropy",
    ", we use the wkb description of these modes , and require that the positive killing frequency particle lies outside the horizon while the negative killing frequency partner lies inside . having formed a wavepacket , at any given time the wavevector of the particle and partner is given by the stationary point of the wavepacket integral over @xmath80 .",
    "it follows from ( [ plusminus ] ) and the fact that no other rapidly oscillating function of @xmath80 appears in the wavepacket that , at leading wkb order , this wavevector is the _ same _ for the particle and partner . that common wavevector is then used to locate the particle and partner using the dispersion relation with @xmath263 for the particle and @xmath226 for the partner .      in the near horizon region ,",
    "the dispersion relation ( [ nhdisp ] ) reads = k x - k + f(k , p; ) .",
    "[ eq1 ] solving for the trajectory @xmath274 we have x( , p , k ;  ) = x_0(k , p; ) +  / k , [ x ] with x_0(k , p;)= ( k - f(k , p;))/k . [ xmean ] as just explained , the particle and partner have the same value of @xmath132 at any given time , and opposite values of @xmath80 . hence the mean position ( [ xmean ] ) of the pair is independent of @xmath80 , while the separation of the particle and partner is universally given by x = 2  / k , independent of @xmath73 and the form of the dispersion .",
    "this reflects at the classical level the fact , seen in ( [ factoreddisp ] ) , that the modes always split into a factor independent of @xmath73 and @xmath229 and a factor independent of @xmath80 .",
    "this result , as many others , is identical to what was found in the 1 + 1 case studied in @xcite because the transverse momentum @xmath73 only enters as a modification of the dispersion function @xmath229 .",
    "the space time trajectories @xmath275 are determined by ( [ x ] ) since @xmath276 is known .",
    "as seen in ( [ kdot ] ) , the @xmath132-trajectories are simply given by @xmath277 , again independently of the value of @xmath73 and the dispersion relation governed by @xmath229 .",
