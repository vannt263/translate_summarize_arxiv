    "although these methods can cover different contingencies , they mainly focus on steady - state analysis and can not capture the full performance of dynamic var sources .",

    "section [ allocation ] discusses the formulation of optimal placement of dynamic var sources and its implementation .",
    "then in section [ vsi method ] , we briefly introduce the voltage sensitivity index based placement of dynamic var sources , which will be compared with the proposed method in case studies . in section",
    "[ case ] , the proposed method is tested and validated on an npcc 140-bus system . finally the conclusion is drawn in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "here , we introduce the fundamentals of controllability and the definition of ecc .      for a linear time - invariant system    [ linear ] = a + + = +    where @xmath0 is the state vector , @xmath1 is the input vector , and @xmath2 is the output vector , it is controllable if the controllability matrix @xmath3\\ ] ] or the controllability gramian @xcite @xmath4 has full rank .    for a nonlinear system    [ n1 ]",
    "= ( , ) + = ( , )    where @xmath0 is the state vector , @xmath1 is the input vector , and @xmath2 is the output vector , it is locally controllable at @xmath5 if the nonlinear controllability matrix obtained by using lie derivative has full rank at @xmath6 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the rank test method is easy and straightforward for linear systems .",
    "however , for nonlinear systems this can be very complicated even for small systems .",
    "one possibility is to linearize the nonlinear system .",
    "but the nonlinear behavior will inevitably be lost .",
    "alternatively , empirical controllability covariance @xcite , @xcite provides a computable tool for empirical analysis of the input - state behaviour of a nonlinear system .",
    "it is also proven that the ecc of a stable linear system described by ( [ linear ] ) is equal to the usual controllability gramian @xcite .",
    "the following sets are defined for ecc : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of matrices for excitation directions , @xmath9 is the number of different excitation sizes for each direction , @xmath10 is the number of inputs to the system , and @xmath11 is the identity matrix with dimension @xmath10 .    for a nonlinear system ( [ n1 ] ) , ecc can be defined as @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the state of the nonlinear system corresponding to the input @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the shape of the input .    for practical implementation , the discrete form of the ecc can be defined as @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the state of the nonlinear system at time step @xmath22 corresponding to the input @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the number of points chosen for the approximation of the integral in ( [ gd ] ) , and @xmath25 is the time interval between two points .    for multiple inputs @xmath26 , we have @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the empirical covariance for input @xmath29 .",
    "the ecc for a system with @xmath10 inputs is the summation of the empirical covariances computed for each of the @xmath10 inputs @xcite .",
    "here , we discuss how to calculate the ecc used for dynamic var sources placement . because the voltages are of interest for fidvr issues",
    ", we consider the state as the voltage magnitude of all buses in the system , which can be obtained by dynamic simulations , such as by using siemens pti pss / e @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in section [ s_cont ] , the ecc for a system with @xmath10 inputs is the summation of the empirical covariances for each of the @xmath10 inputs . then the ecc calculated from placing @xmath10 dynamic var sources individually adds to be the covariance calculated from placing the @xmath10 dynamic var sources simultaneously .",
    "depending on whether or not a fault and the corresponding outputs of the installed dynamic var sources are specified , there are two methods to calculate the ecc , which will be discussed separately as follows .    1 .",
    "* case 1fault specified * + a specific fault is applied and each time one dynamic var source is installed at one of the load buses , whose reactive power output is considered as the input .",
    "this is the case in which dynamic var sources need to be placed to address a given fault , e.g. the most severe fault .",
    "we do not explicitly use the excitation size @xmath30 but install dynamic var sources with different capacities to apply different sizes of input perturbation .",
    "each input has a series of step changes and at time step @xmath22 it is : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the reactive power output of the dynamic var source with the @xmath33th capacity at time step @xmath22 and @xmath34 is the time instant when the @xmath22th step change occurs ; @xmath35 is the unit step function defined as @xmath36 + correspondingly , @xmath30 in ( [ gd1 ] ) is substituted by @xmath32 instead and the definition of ecc is modified to be : @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "* case 2fault unspecified * + no fault is specified and the dynamic response is obtained by perturbing the reactive power load at one load bus .",
    "the perturbation could be a step , pulse , or some specifically defined function that can well mimic the response of dynamic var sources .",
    "this generally applies to the case that dynamic var sources need to be placed to address fidvr issues following multiple faults .",
    "+ the case study later will apply the perturbation as illustrated in fig . [",
    "pulse ] to potential svc locations , which mimics the var injection from an svc under fault conditions . in fig .",
    "[ pulse ] , four actual svc outputs are obtained by simulating the output of a 200 mvar svc installed at four different locations in the npcc system following the most severe n-1 contingency , which can be approximated by a pulse change of 200 mvar lasting for 1s .",
    "we may use different magnitudes for the pulse change to calculate the ecc .",
    "+ the perturbation can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are parameters that can be chosen as different values to reflect the response of dynamic var sources under different scenarios , such as different types of faults at different locations with different time durations .",
    "+ since the response of dynamic var sources is simulated by changing the reactive power of load buses , for which increasing or reducing reactive power separately correspond to absorbing or injecting reactive power by dynamic var sources , @xmath44 that are used to defined the empirical covariance in ( [ gd1 ] ) is chosen as @xmath45 .",
    "here , we formulate the optimal dynamic var source placement problem based on ecc and discuss its implementation .      the degree of controllability can be quantified by a variety of different measures of the ecc , such as the smallest eigenvalue @xcite@xcite , the trace @xcite , @xcite , the determinant @xcite , @xcite@xcite , or the condition number @xcite , @xcite .",
    "different measures reflect various aspects of controllability : the smallest eigenvalue defines the worst scenario of controllability ; the trace measures the total gain from input variation to state ; the condition number emphasizes the numerical stability ; and the determinant measures the overall controllability in all directions in noise space .",
    "although the trace of empirical covariance also tends to measure the overall controllability , it can not tell the existence of a zero eigenvalue . thus an uncontrollable system may still have a large trace .",
    "compared with the method based on the smallest eigenvalue , the determinant is a smooth function , which is a desirable property in numerical computations .    based on these considerations , in this paper we choose the objective as the maximization of the determinant of the ecc under different dynamic var source placements , which is the same as that in @xcite for optimal pmu placement for dynamic state estimation .",
    "the optimal placement of dynamic var sources can thus be formulated as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the vector of binary control variables that determines where to place the dynamic var sources , @xmath48 is the corresponding ecc , @xmath49 is the number of load buses , and @xmath10 is the number of dynamic var sources to be placed .",
    "since the ecc for a system with @xmath10 inputs is the summation of the empirical covariances computed for each of the @xmath10 inputs individually , as mentioned in section [ s_cont ] , the ecc calculated from placing @xmath10 dynamic var sources individually adds to be the identical covariance calculated from placing the @xmath10 dynamic var sources simultaneously .",
    "based on this property , the optimization problem ( [ opt ] ) can be written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the ecc by only placing one dynamic var source at load bus @xmath52 .",
    "the determinant of a matrix is a high - degree polynomial and its absolute value can be too small or too huge to be represented as a standard double - precision floating - point number .",
    "by contrast , the logarithm of the determinant is much smaller number and can be simply represented .",
    "thus we can equivalently rewrite the optimization problem in ( [ opt1 ] ) as @xmath53    to summarize , the optimal placement of dynamic var sources based on the maximization of the determinant of the ecc can be implemented in the following two steps .    1 .",
    "* calculate ecc * + the ecc in ( [ gd ] ) is calculated by emgr ( empirical gramian framework ) @xcite on time interval @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "we choose @xmath55 as 5 seconds .",
    "note that we only need to calculate the ecc for placing one dynamic var sources at one of the load buses and there is no need to compute all the combinations of dynamic var source locations .",
    "2 .   * solve max - det optimization problem * + the mixed - integer max - det optimization problem in ( [ opt2 ] ) is solved by using the nomad solver @xcite , which is a derivative - free global mixed integer nonlinear programming solver and is called by the opti toolbox @xcite .",
    "the nomad solver implements the mesh adaptive direct search ( mads ) algorithm @xcite , a derivative - free direct search method with a rigorous convergence theory based on the nonsmooth calculus @xcite , and aims for the best possible solution with a small number of evaluations . under mild hypotheses",
    ", the algorithm globally converges to a point satisfying local optimality conditions based on local properties of the functions defining the problem @xcite .",
    "+ nomad also includes a variable neighborhood search ( vns ) algorithm @xcite , which is based on the vns metaheuristic @xcite .",
    "this search strategy perturbs the current iterate and conducts poll - like descents from the perturbed point , allowing an escape from local optima on which the algorithm may be trapped @xcite .",
    "a traditional approach for the placement of dynamic var sources is to evaluate , for a small amount of var injection at a candidate bus , how sensitively voltage at one or several target voltage - vulnerable buses will change following the most severe contingency @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the most severe contingency can be identified by simulating a list of credible contingencies , which are short - circuit faults near a load bus cleared after a protection reaction time , and finding the buses where violations of post - fault voltage criteria happen .",
    "some criteria , such as the nerc / wecc reliability standards @xcite , usually limit the post - fault voltage deviations .",
    "examples of such criteria are :    1 .",
    "post - fault transient voltage dip or overshoot should not exceed 25% at load buses or 30% at generator buses , and should not exceed 20% for more than 20 cycles at load buses ; 2 .   post - transient voltage deviation should not exceed 5% at any bus .",
    "[ nerc ] illustrates the criteria for load buses .",
    "assume that the simulation time step is @xmath56 , the total simulation period is @xmath57 .",
    "if the @xmath22th contingency causes violation of the criteria at bus @xmath58 , a severity index @xmath59 about the violation at time step @xmath60 can be evaluated as follows .    for each bus @xmath58 ,",
    "the percentage voltage deviation at the @xmath60th time step is defined as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the bus @xmath58 voltage magnitude at time step @xmath60 and @xmath63 is the pre - fault initial voltage magnitude . let @xmath64 if any of the above criteria is violated , or 0 , otherwise .",
    "then , this average severity index over the simulation period is calculated for each contingency @xmath22 as @xmath65        the contingencies with the largest @xmath66 are considered as the most severe contingencies . for an identified severe",
    "contingency , a dynamic var source is generally placed where var injection causes large sensitivities in terms of post - fault voltage improvements at those buses violating the criteria .",
    "for instance , a method based on the post - fault voltage sensitivity index ( vsi ) defined in @xcite may be applied . for a severe contingency @xmath22",
    ", a small amount of dynamic var @xmath67 is injected at bus @xmath52 , which can be simulated by adding an svc or statcom of size @xmath67 .",
    "assume that the var injection changes the voltage at bus @xmath58 from @xmath68 to @xmath69 at time step @xmath60 according to time - domain simulation .",
    "for each bus @xmath58 over the whole simulation period , vsi is defined as the maximum voltage recovery sensitivity and can be calculated by @xmath70 then , the normalized average voltage sensitivity index for all of the @xmath71 buses of the system following the injection @xmath67 under contingency @xmath22 is @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the set of the candidate buses to install dynamic var sources .    if the top @xmath24 most severe contingencies are considered , the overall sensitivity index can be calculated as @xmath74 if @xmath10 dynamic var sources are to be installed , using the top @xmath24 most severe contingency , the vsi method calculates @xmath75 for each bus and selects the top-@xmath10 buses with the highest @xmath75 to install dynamic var sources .",
    "here , the proposed dynamic var sources placement method is tested on an npcc 140-bus system @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ npcc1 ] , the npcc system has 48 generators and 140 buses and represents the northeast region of the eastern interconnection system .",
    "for both aforementioned case 1 ( fault specified ) and case 2 ( fault unspecified ) in section [ calecc ] , the vsi and ecc based methods are compared .",
    "note that the svc placements identified by the vsi - based method can be further improved during the optimization of dynamic var sizes , as has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "similarly , the svc locations determined by the proposed ecc - based method can also be improved . however , in this paper we do not consider the optimization of dynamic var sizes but only target at finding the optimal placements of svcs which are assumed to have a predetermined size .",
    "we assume that all dynamic var sources are svcs and all of the svcs have an identical capacity of 200 mvar unless otherwise stated . in the time - domain simulation ,",
    "the composite load model clodbl and svc model csvgn5 provided by siemens pti pss / e @xcite are applied to simulate fidvr issues and to provide the solutions by svcs .    the clodbl load model shown in fig .",
    "[ lm ] is used for power system planning and operation studies in pss / e .",
    "it consists of induction motors , lighting , and other types of equipment , and is used where it is desirable to represent loads at dynamic level . by using this model , users are allowed to specify a minimum amount of data stating the general characteristic of the composite load , which can be used internally to establish the relative sizes of motors modeled in dynamic detail .",
    "the parameters of the composite load are listed in table [ para ] .",
    ".parameters for composite load model [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     fig .",
    "[ trend ] shows the percentage coverage of the contingencies with fidvr issues addressed by the vsi - based and fault unspecified ecc2 methods .",
    "[ fig11 ] shows the increase of the percentage coverage with the increase of the number of svcs for the ecc2 method .",
    "for example , from 5 to 10 svcs installation , the coverage increases by 7.5% , 15% , and 10% for 4- , 5- , and 6-cycle fault duration , respectively .",
    "it is seen that the coverage grows rapidly when the number of svcs is less than 25 , and then does not grow for 4-cycle fault duration and hardly grow for 5- and 6-cycle duration . from table [ fidvr - coverage ] and figs .",
    "[ trend ] and [ fig11 ] , it is also seen that there is a maximum number of svcs above which the contingency coverage will not increase . for example , for 5-cycle fault duration , this maximum number is 40 .",
    "the optimal number of svcs that minimizes the total cost can also be determined .",
    "the total cost includes that for installing svcs ( @xmath76 ) and that for the fidvr issues caused by the contingencies that are not addressed for the considered fault durations ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the total cost can be written as : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the cost of one svc , @xmath80 is the number of svcs installed , @xmath81 is the cost of fivdr issue caused by one contingency , @xmath82 is the total number of contingencies that are considered , and @xmath83 is the number of contingencies addressed by installing @xmath80 svcs which is a function of @xmath80 , and @xmath84 is the number of fault durations .    with the increase of @xmath80 , @xmath76 will linearly increase while @xmath77 will decrease before the effect of installing svcs in eliminating the contingencies with fidvr issues saturates .",
    "therefore , we can get an optimal number of svcs ( @xmath85 ) that minimizes the total cost @xmath86 . by assuming @xmath87 , the optimal number of svcs is determined as 25 and the corresponding minimal cost is @xmath88 .",
    "we also evaluate the vsi1 , vsi3 , ecc1 , and ecc2 methods under an extreme case , in which a three - phase fault is applied at bus 35 and is cleared by opening line @xmath89 after 5 cycles , and a half of the generation at bus 21 is lost when the line is tripped . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , the voltages collapse after the fault is cleared .",
    "[ fig13 ] illustrates the voltage recovery under the four methods with 5 svcs installed .",
    "the svc placement for ecc1 is bus 6 , 12 , 19 , 30 , and 56 while those for vsi1 , vsi3 , and ecc2 can be found in table [ placement ] .    from fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] it is seen that the system voltages can be successfully maintained against this voltage collapse scenario by 5 svcs placed by all four methods .",
    "since the location of the initiating fault of the voltage collapse is close to the most severe contingency used by ecc1 and vsi1 and also the top three most severe contingencies used by vsi3 , the svcs placed by them are closer to the initiating fault and are more effective in preventing voltage collapse and maintaining system stability . because ecc2 is fault independent and focuses on the controllability of voltages across the whole system , it is not as effective as the other methods .",
    "the resulting damping ratios of the system with 5 svcs placed by vsi1 , vsi3 , ecc1 , and ecc2 are estimated by the prony analysis as 10.20% , 8.07% , 9.51% , and 6.67% , respectively , which also verifies the above comparison of the four methods .              in the above sections we assume that all of the svcs have an identical capacity of 200 mvar . here ,",
    "we discuss how svc sizes may influence the results .",
    "[ fig14 ] illustrates the percentage coverage for different svc capacities .",
    "it is seen that the improvement of contingency coverages is not obvious when the svc capacity is above 200 mvar , which also implies that it is practical to install svcs with a 200 mvar capacity .",
    "in this paper , ecc is applied to quantify the degree of controllability of the voltage magnitudes under a specific dynamic var source placement and the optimal placement problem for dynamic var sources is formulated as an optimization problem that maximizes the determinant of ecc .    the proposed method is tested and validated on an npcc 140-bus system .",
    "the results show that the proposed method for fault specified case can solve the fidvr issue caused by the most severe n-1 contingency with fewer dynamic var sources than that of the vsi - based method .",
    "the proposed method for fault unspecified case does not depend on the settings of the contingency and thus has better performance under different fault durations , in the sense that when placing the same number of svcs the proposed method can address more fidvr issues than the vsi - based method .",
    "the optimal number of svcs that minimizes the total cost is determined and it is shown that the proposed method can help mitigate voltage collapse .",
    "it is also found that the improvement is not obvious when the svc capacity is above 200 mvar .",
