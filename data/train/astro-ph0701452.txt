    "barred galaxies represent an important sub - sample of systems in any study of galaxy interactions and induced star formation .",
    "bar formation is attributed to one of two possible mechanisms ; bars can form spontaneously as a result of an intrinsic gravitational instability , or they can be produced by tidal disturbance of the galactic potential during an interaction .",
    "both mechanisms are supported by numerical simulations .",
    "massive stellar disks with small velocity dispersions are intrinsically unstable to bar formation and will develop a strong bar structure without external perturbation within a few rotation periods ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "similarly , external perturbations can induce bar structures in galactic disks that are stable in isolation .",
    "observationally , @xcite used @xmath2-band images to study the bar fraction in a sample of pairs , finding 80% of the pairs to display signs of bar formation .",
    "@xcite also find a high fraction of barred galaxies in binary systems ( @xmath3 ) , higher than in the field ( @xmath4 ) or group environments ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "however , @xcite , using a sample of 930 galaxies found no evidence for a dependence of bar frequency on galaxy environment , consistent with the nature of the host galaxy being the most important factor in bar formation . taken together these results suggest that bar formation is strongly dependent on the host galaxy , but that pair - wise interactions do induce bars in many systems .",
    "galaxy bars represent a principal mode of disruption to the axisymmetric potential of spiral galaxies , providing a mechanism of gas inflow toward the central regions .",
    "the simulations of @xcite and mh96 indicate that bars can play a particularly important role in fly - by encounters , where they provide a dominant trigger for central gas concentration and ensuing star formation .",
    "in addition , the high proportion of galaxies in the local universe hosting bars @xcite means that the response of a barred potential to an external perturbation is also of interest .",
    "the relationship between bars and interactions and the evolution of the ism in barred systems is crucial in attaining a better understanding of the star formation response of interacting galaxies .    both theoretical ( mh96 ) and observational @xcite evidence exists pointing to enhanced molecular gas concentration in barred systems ( at least in early - type spirals ) .",
    "however , the relationship between bars and star formation remains less clear .",
    "whilst bars do not appear to affect the disk - wide star - formation properties of galaxies , they can be important in triggering enhanced star formation in the central regions ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "star formation in barred galaxies manifests itself in a diverse range of morphologies @xcite . a number of studies point to an enhanced level of star formation in the central region of early - type barred systems , although similar enhancements are not observed in late - type systems .",
    "this distinction is consistent with molecular gas observations .",
    "bars may well play a particularly important role in the evolution of the most actively star - forming systems .",
    "@xcite examined the @xmath6 ratio in a sample of ir - bright galaxies and only detected a difference between the barred and non - barred systems for the most actively star - forming galaxies .",
    "similarly , @xcite found a higher incidence of bars in starburst galaxies , and @xcite , who looked at the properties of intrinsically luminous galaxies , detected a mean ir luminosity three times larger in barred systems than their unbarred counterparts .    in this paper",
    "we examine the spatial and kinematic distribution of both the atomic and molecular gas associated with ngc  5218 , the late - type barred spiral galaxy in the spiral  elliptical interacting pair arp  104 .",
    "this is one of a small sample of nine spiral  elliptical interacting pairs , which have been studied by and @xcite .",
    "each pair has an flux of at least 5  jy  km  s@xmath7 , and arp 104 has a relatively large separation between the galaxies , implying they are in the early state of interaction .",
    "we use these data in conjunction with @xmath0-body simulations and data probing the star formation properties of this system to assess the impact of the bar on ngc  5218 s evolution , and look at the extent to which the tidal interaction may have been important in triggering its bar . in section  [ observations ] we present details of our and co observations . in section  [ results ]",
    "we discuss the star - formation properties and efficiency of ngc  5218 and present the results of the simulations . in section  [ bar_imp ]",
    "we examine the importance of the bar in this galaxy . in section  [ discuss ]",

    "the first step in the analysis of the bar is to attain a rotation curve for ngc  5218 .",
    "the rotation curve was established predominately using the vla data . using the channel maps ( fig .",
    "[ a104hi_channel.fig ] ) , spatial and velocity selection were use to isolate gas which is dynamically associated with ngc  5218 , this corresponded to gas out to a radius of approximately 9  kpc .",
    "ngc  5218 contains a bright central radio continuum source and as a result in the nuclear region is seen in absorption , making it difficult to fit a rotation curve to the data in this region .",
    "however , in the central region our observations provide a reliable estimate of the rotation curve .",
    "we therefore use data for radii beyond about 2.5  kpc and co data within this radius .",
    "the observations have the additional advantage that they are higher resolution than the data , reducing the problems of beam - smearing in the centre of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "rotation curves for ngc  5218 were derived from the intensity - weighted velocity field of the and co data using the aips task gal . for both the and co datasets we used the highest resolution images , so as to minimise the effect of beam smearing . for the data this corresponded to a spatial resolution @xmath118 , and for the co data the resolution was @xmath119 .",
    "the rotation curves were derived using a tilted - ring model @xcite .",
    "this method approximates the galaxy as a set of concentric rings of gas at increasing radii , characterised by a circular velocity , position angle and inclination angle .",
    "attempts to derive the rotation curve leaving the dynamic centre and inclination angle as free parameters yielded unphysical results .",
    "the dynamical centre was therefore calculated by performing a global rotation curve fit to datasets at three different resolutions for both brandt and exponential rotation curves independently .",
    "the dynamical centre was found to be stable across all fits and was therefore fixed for the purposes of the tilted - ring curve fitting .",
    "optical data were used to fix the inclination angle which was taken from the hyperleda database .",
    "the rotation curve was fitted by breaking the galaxy into annuli @xmath120 in width ( approximately the half - beam width ) and fitting the velocity field in each annulus , keeping the dynamical centre and inclination angle fixed .",
    "radii below @xmath30 in which the is seen predominately in absorption were excluded .",
    "a similar fit was performed on the molecular gas data , using the same fixed dynamical centre and inclination angle . for these higher resolution data",
    "@xmath121 annuli were used , and the data were fit from zero radius outwards . in fig .",
    "[ vel_comb.fig ] we plot the circular velocity @xmath122 , resulting from analysis .",
    "we fit a function to these data the differential of which was evaluated to allow computation of @xmath123 , the epicyclic frequency . in fig .",
    "[ omega_all.fig ] we plot the angular velocity , @xmath124 and @xmath125 curves .",
    "the error bars on figs  [ vel_comb.fig ] and [ omega_all.fig ] do not include any possible bias due to beam smearing .",
    "science - grade images in @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 were downloaded from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) archive .",
    "the @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 passbands are less sensitive to extinction by dust in the central regions of the galaxies than shorter wavelengths , and offer a bar tracer that is unlikely to be contaminated by recent star formation .",
    "we adopt the method of @xcite  see also @xcite and @xcite for examples of this technique  to estimate the length of the bar ; this assumes the bar ends correspond to the point of maximum ellipticity when fitting the galaxy isophotes .",
    "the ellipticity of the 2mass image isophotes , in the plane of the sky , were fit using the iraf stsdas task ellipse , which measures the surface brightness , ellipticity and position angle of the semi - major axis .",
    "figure  [ ellip_fit.fig ] shows the ellipse fitted ellipticities for both the @xmath126- and @xmath2-band 2mass images .",
    "both images give very similar results ; the @xmath126-band image indicates a maximum ellipticity of @xmath129 at a radius of @xmath130 and the @xmath2-band image a maximum ellipticity of @xmath131 at a radius of @xmath132 .",
    "the bar s de - projected length @xmath133 can then be obtained from the observed length @xmath134 using @xmath135 @xcite , where @xmath79 is the inclination angle of the galaxy ( @xmath111 ) and @xmath136 is the angle the bar makes with galaxy s major axis in the plane of the galaxy . to determine @xmath136 we take the position angle of the galaxy to be the average of position angles fitted to the data using the tilted - ring model in gal and the position angle of the bar to be that obtained by the iraf package ellipse at maximum ellipticity .",
    "these angles are @xmath137 and @xmath138 respectively .",
    "thus , the angle the bar makes with the major axis in the plane of the sky @xmath139 , and @xmath136 follows since @xmath140 , thus @xmath141 .",
    "these angles yield a very small correction factor in converting between the observed and de - projected bar length : @xmath142 , giving @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "assuming co - rotation is at @xmath145 @xcite yields a co - rotation radius of @xmath146 which corresponds to a physical radius of 3.4  kpc and gives and estimate of the pattern speed of the bar of 40 @xmath10 kpc@xmath7 , which is similar to that seen in other sb galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "examining the angular velocity obtained from the rotation curve fitting at a radius of 3.4  kpc we find the velocity is significantly larger than the peak value of the @xmath147 curve ; this implies there is no inner lindblad resonance in ngc  5218 .",
    "we note that the calculated radius of co - rotation ( 3.4  kpc ) is not dissimilar to the radius obtained by measuring distance between the molecular gas peaks toward the ends of the bar ( 3.9  kpc ) .",
    "constraints on the existence or not of an inner lindblad resonance in ngc  5218 depend sensitively on @xmath148 and @xmath149 . as",
    "such they are subject to a large degree of uncertainty .",
    "in particular , the absence of an observed peak in the @xmath150 is symptomatic of a mass distribution which is not strongly centrally condensed ; inner lindblad resonances only develop if the mass distribution is sufficiently centrally peaked .",
    "it is well known that low resolution observations smooth out the steep central rise of rotation curves which results from the core and bulge of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the limited resolution of our observations is making it difficult to detect the steeply rising rotation curve in the central region of ngc  5218 and as such yielding an artificially smooth @xmath150 curve .",
    "figure  [ vel_comb.fig ] shows the fitted circular velocities for both the and co datasets . around radii of approximately 3  kpc , where we have both atomic and molecular gas observations",
    "there is a clear deviation in the velocity structure of the two components .",
    "this is not unexpected .",
    "the fall in the angular velocity of the molecular gas around 3  kpc , in the region of the bar end may be a result of streaming motions within the bar .",
    "gas on the elongated , so - called @xmath151 orbits in the bar @xcite , has a rotational velocity at the apex of the ellipse , near the end of the bar , which is lower than that of gas on a circular orbits at the same radius , therefore its @xmath148 will be lower . by comparison ,",
    "if the has a large scale height than the molecular gas , it is likely to have been less influenced by the bar in this region .",
    "we have also performed a more detailed comparison of the and co dynamics by comparing the and spectra at four locations across the disk .",
    "the spectra were extracted from data cubes at a common resolution of @xmath152 . in the central region",
    "the linewidths and lineshape of the spectra were very similar . in the more extended regions",
    "the molecular gas displays a broader linewidth than the .",
    "in particular , at the eastern end of the bar , the molecular gas displays a two - peaked profile with the atomic gas indicating emission in only one of these peaks .",
    "in section  [ gas_content.sec ] we showed that ngc  5218 has a large molecular gas mass for an sbb galaxy .",
    "the molecular gas distribution is strongly centrally concentrated with a peak surface density greater than 2000 m@xmath41 pc@xmath82 ( section  [ 5218_co.sec ] ) .",
    "numerous numerical simulations predict that bars , whether spontaneously or externally triggered , can induce large scale gas inflow toward the central regions of galaxies .",
    "two recent observational studies have found strong evidence for this process ; both @xcite and @xcite have demonstrated that barred galaxies have a larger concentration of molecular gas in their central kiloparsec than unbarred systems .",
    "@xcite used the nro  ovro survey of 20 nearby spiral galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to show that the degree of concentration of molecular gas in the central kiloparsec of barred spiral galaxies is greater than in their unbarred counterparts .",
    "they quantify this effect using the ratio of the molecular gas surface density in the central kiloparsec to that over the entire optical disk ( @xmath153 ) , finding this ratio is on average four times larger in barred than in unbarred systems .",
    "@xcite studied a sample of 50 nearby spirals  including both late type barred and unbarred spirals , and co - bright and co - faint galaxies  and found the effect of the bar equally pronounced in late and early hubble type spirals .",
    "atomic gas observations also indicate higher gas column densities in barred galaxies .",
    "@xcite examined the atomic gas column density in front of seyfert nuclei using x - ray measurements and found significantly higher column densities in seyferts with barred hosts than those in the unbarred sample . to estimate @xmath153 for ngc  5218",
    "we remade the channel maps at the highest possible spatial resolution ( @xmath154 , @xmath155 kpc ) .",
    "although beam smearing introduces uncertainty into our analysis , we find a flux over the central kiloparsec in ngc  5218 which corresponds to a gas mass of @xmath156 m@xmath41 .",
    "this is equivalent to a molecular hydrogen surface density of @xmath157 m@xmath41 pc@xmath82 and a gas surface density of @xmath158 m@xmath41 pc@xmath82 .",
    "this is approximately six times the mean of the barred sample of @xcite ( @xmath159 m@xmath41 pc@xmath82 ) .",
    "in addition , the data for ngc  5218 indicate an @xmath153 value of 113 , almost twice the average of the bima sample ( @xmath160 ) and slightly larger than the average of the nro ",
    "ovro sample ( @xmath161 ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the two literature values can be attributed to the nro ",
    "ovro sample consisting mainly of co - luminous galaxies .",
    "in contrast , the bima sample was selected on the basis of @xmath65-band magnitude and thus represents , at least from the perspective of co flux comparison , a less biased sample .",
    "the existence of the bar in ngc  5218 has led to a very large central molecular gas surface density , even within the context of barred galaxies .",
    "for comparison we note that typical mean densities of the largest molecular cloud complexes in m31 , m33 and m51 are in the range @xmath162 m@xmath41 pc@xmath82 , whilst the gas surface density of a typical giant molecular cloud in the outer disk of the milky way is 200 m@xmath41 pc@xmath82 @xcite .",
    "the impact of the bar potential on the gas distribution in ngc  5218 is consistent with the bar s ellipticity , which implies it is a strong bar .",
    "the ellipticity of a bar is thought to provide a good measure of the bar strength .",
    "@xcite identify strong bars as those with an ellipticity greater than 0.4 ; the 2mass @xmath2-band data for ngc  5218 give a deprojected ellipticity for ngc  5218 of the bar of at least 0.4 .",
    "simulations by @xcite find that weak bars have almost no effect on the radial distribution of the ism .",
    "in contrast , strong extended bars are likely to be more effective at driving gas toward the centre of the galaxy .",
    "their simulations also indicate that bars are only able to drive gas inwards to a radius at which a ring forms ; for bars containing inner rings , little net inflow takes place inside this radius .",
    "nuclear rings are likely to form when so - called @xmath163 orbits exist ; such orbits require the presence of two inner lindblad resonances .",
    "our very high central gas densities are consistent with no inner ring and no inner lindblad resonances as our analysis of the bar dynamics suggests .      the molecular gas mass in ngc  5218 and the resulting gas column densities are calculated using the co - to - h@xmath72 conversion factor , @xmath164 @xmath61 k  km  s@xmath7 , which is appropriate for molecular gas clouds in the milky way @xcite . in adopting this conversion factor",
    "we assume that the conditions of the molecular gas clouds in ngc  5218 are similar to the molecular gas clouds in the milky way .",
    "this is an assumption , and it is possible that the co emissivity in this system is enhanced due to high pressures and/or velocity dispersion in the bulge region @xcite .",
    "however , the observation of a @xmath93co ( @xmath94)/ line ratio of @xmath95 in ngc  5218 , which is comparable to the value observed in the milky way when averaged over 300 pc , lends weight to the adoption of the milky way conversion factor .",
    "although the molecular gas distribution in ngc  5218 is centrally concentrated , there is also evidence of more extended emission ( see fig .  [ 5218co10_mom0.fig ] ) . in particular",
    ", the integrated emission indicates two molecular gas condensations slightly offset from the bar ends .",
    "the radius of these gas peaks ( 3.9  kpc ) is similar to the calculated radius of co - rotation ( 3.4  kpc ) , see section  [ barlength.sec ] .",
    "the presence of these gas complexes , like that of the large central peak , can be attributed to the existence of a barred potential .",
    "gas concentrations at bar ends have been observed in a number of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these concentrations may be stagnation points in the gas flow ; gas on @xmath151 orbits at the bar ends will have a smaller angular velocity than more central gas due to its larger radius .",
    "their presence may also be due to the convergence of gas on elliptical orbits in the bar with gas on more circular orbits in the region just beyond the bar @xcite ; these gas complexes are located in a transition region between the spiral arms and bar ends .",
    "although the bar in ngc  5218 appears to have contributed to a central concentration of gas , this process appears to be ongoing .",
    "we now consider the origin of ngc  5218 s high molecular gas mass . in section  [ gas_content.sec ]",
    "we showed that ngc  5218 has a comparatively low mass .",
    "the bar may have led predominately to the transport of existing molecular material from the disk to the centre of ngc  5218 , or this transport could have involved both atomic and molecular gas with subsequent conversion of atomic to molecular gas in the central region .",
    "studied the effects of bars on the neutral hydrogen content of starburst and seyfert galaxies and found that the barred galaxies had a lower total mass than unbarred galaxies .",
    "they suggest that atomic gas is funnelled toward the centre of barred galaxies where it is then converted to molecular gas . in section  [ a104_hi.sec ]",
    "we used absorption observations to estimate the atomic gas column density in the centre of ngc  5218 to be @xmath165 @xmath61 .",
    "various studies indicate a ` transition ' column density at which is sufficiently dense for self - shielding to allow the formation of h@xmath72 of @xmath166 @xmath61 , increasing to @xmath167 @xmath61 for large molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "the column density observed at the centre of ngc  5218 lies above these values so to h@xmath72 conversion may be taking place at the centre of ngc  5218 .",
    "the high h@xmath72 to ratio in the centre of ngc  5218 and the dynamical consistency of the two components in the central region ( see section  [ 5218_hicocomp.sec ] ) is certainly consistent with inflow of both components and efficient to h@xmath72 conversion .      in section  [ 5218_starformrate.sec ]",
    "we estimated the sfr of ngc  5218 using both radio and fir data ; these data yield sfrs of 3.4 and 5.3 m@xmath41 yr@xmath7 respectively . a large proportion of the star formation is taking place in the dusty central region of ngc  5218 ( see below ) where we observe a very large molecular gas density .",
    "however , both the radio and fir provide largely extinction - free probes of the star formation and as such should yield robust estimates of the sfr .",
    "comparison of the nvss ( @xmath168 ) flux density ( @xmath169 mjy ) and the first @xcite ( @xmath170 ) flux density ( @xmath171 mjy ) suggests at least 75% of the galaxy s star formation is coming from the central kiloparsec region .    before discussing the star - formation properties of ngc  5218 we note a potential caveat with the estimation of the sfr of this system .",
    "a number of authors have examined the optical spectroscopy of ngc  5218 for agn activity . on the basis of their investigation @xcite",
    "conclude the emission line properties of ngc  5218 are ambiguous , and @xcite classify it as a liner .",
    "ngc  5218 sits comfortably on the radio - fir correlation @xcite with no obvious radio or fir excess ; the two sfr estimators yield very similar results ( section  [ 5218_starformrate.sec ] ) .",
    "in addition , recent work by @xcite suggests that in their sample of ir - bright liners the low x - ray luminosities and eddington ratios imply the contribution from the agn to the fir luminosity is likely to be small .",
    "however , we can not exclude the possibility that nuclear activity in this system leads to an overestimated fir sfr .",
    "ngc  5218 appears to have a substantial star formation rate .",
    "the 60-@xmath37 m luminosity of ngc  5218 , @xmath172 l@xmath41 , is more than three times the median for sb  sbc galaxies found by @xcite , although it does not qualify it as luminous infrared galaxy ( lirg ) .",
    "ngc  5218 s @xmath127-band normalised sfr , an approximation of star formation per unit mass , implies a slightly enhanced value @xcite .",
    "the mean value of @xmath173 obtained by @xcite for sb  sbc galaxies was @xmath174 , whereas the value for ngc  5218 is @xmath175 , consistent with a high current sfr in relation to its recent star formation history ( although it may also reflect , to some extent , increased gas and therefore dust in its centre ) .",
    "the star - formation efficiency ( sfe ) is the ratio of the current star - formation rate to the mass of molecular gas : for ngc  5218 the sfe derived from the fir star formation rate and total molecular gas mass is @xmath176 yr@xmath7 .",
    "this value , whilst larger than the average for sb galaxies , is still significantly below the @xmath177 over @xmath178  yr found in starburst systems . despite ngc  5218 s relatively high star - formation rate , its global star - formation efficiency appears to be more in keeping with that of a normal sb galaxy than a starburst system .",
    "the star formation efficiency of the central @xmath179 kpc is approximately three times the global value , falling toward the lower end of those systems classified as nuclear starbursts    @xcite have investigated the gas - to - dynamical mass ratio in the central kiloparsec of a sample of 20 nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "they observe a larger ratio in galaxies with an spectral classification , and interpret this as evidence for more active star formation and nuclear spectra dominated by regions in galaxies which have large amounts of gas given their size .",
    "they suggest that the effect may be related to the stability of the nuclear molecular gas disk , relating @xmath180 to the toomre @xmath181 parameter @xcite . for comparison with these data we use the highest resolution co data set for ngc  5218 to examine the gas - to - dynamical mass ratio in central kiloparsec .",
    "we integrate the flux obtained in the central molecular gas peak and compare the mass obtained with an estimate of the dynamical mass in this region .",
    "we select a physical region with a radius of @xmath182 kpc , larger than the region ( @xmath183 pc ) examined by @xcite because we can make a more robust estimate of @xmath180 on this scale given our available data .",
    "the region examined lies well within the physical extent of the bar ; the molecular gas dynamics in this region are dominated by circular motion ( fig .",
    "[ 5218co10_mom1.fig ] ) .",
    "assuming keplerian rotation and a spherical mass distribution , the dynamical mass is @xmath184 where @xmath107 is the rotational velocity in the plane of the disk at a radius @xmath185 .",
    "the 20% linewidth over the 1.1  kpc radius region is 280 @xmath10 .",
    "correcting for the inclination of the galaxy yields a rotational velocity in the plane of the disk of 184 @xmath10 , corresponding to a dynamical mass of @xmath186 m@xmath41 .",
    "integrating the co flux observed over this area yields a molecular hydrogen mass of @xmath187 m@xmath41 and a molecular gas mass of @xmath188 m@xmath41 .",
    "the molecular gas mass fraction over the central 1.1  kpc radius region in ngc  5218 is 26% , @xmath189 above the value obtained by @xcite for dominated systems ( @xmath190 over the central kiloparsec ) .",
    "if we reduce the physical scale over which we undertake the comparison , the mass fraction increases dramatically .",
    "our data imply that the gas - to - dynamical mass ratio over the central region of ngc  5218 is large when compared with actively star forming systems in the sakamoto et al .  sample .",
    "we note that the derived @xmath180 is only related to the toomre @xmath181 parameter and the central gas stability if the gas is in the form of a nuclear disk .",
    "bar - streaming motions introduce inherent uncertainty into the use of the ratio @xmath180 as a probe of the stability .",
    "in addition , many theorists are sceptical about using the toomre @xmath181 parameter as a measure of instability toward star formation , arguing that feedback from such star formation would lower the parameter on short timescales ( e.g. , @xcite , see also ) . nonetheless , the results of @xcite indicate that all except one of the galaxies in their sample have an @xmath180 greater than 0.1 and we believe comparison with these observations is useful .      both simulation - based and observational evidence exists linking tidal perturbations with the triggering of bars . in particular , observations in the literature point to bars in early - type galaxies ,",
    "of which ngc  5218 is an example , being produced in this way .",
    "this result is supported by simulations which indicate that a bulge component acts to stabilise the galaxy against spontaneous bar formation , an increasingly massive bulge offering increased stability ( mh96 ) .",
    "it may be that for galaxies with bulges an external trigger is a prerequisite for a bar to form . to investigate any link between the bar in ngc  5218 and its tidal interaction , we look in more detail at the nature of the bar , undertaking comparisons with both simulation - based and observational data .",
    "simulations suggest that interactions can affect bar formation in galaxies in a number of different ways : they can trigger bar formation in an otherwise stable galaxy ; speed up the process of bar formation in a system which is already unstable ; regenerate a dissolved or weakened bar @xcite and enhance or decrease the strength of an existing bar .",
    "all such scenarios are possible in ngc  5218 , although the strength of the bar , as measured from the axial ratio , would imply that the tidal encounter is unlikely to have significantly weakened the bar .    in an investigation of the blue and",
    "near - infrared surface photometry of 15 barred spirals , @xcite observed two different types of major axis surface density profiles , exponential and flat .",
    "on the basis of their simulations , @xcite argue that exponential profiles are found in spontaneously produced bars , whilst flatter profiles occur in bars produced by tidal instability .",
    "unfortunately the photometric data available for ngc  5218 are not of sufficiently high resolution to confidently discern between the two profiles ; the large central peak observed in all bars yields a profile that appears exponential when smoothed to lower resolution .",
    "nonetheless , the sdss @xmath191-band light profile indicates some flattening and a flattened profile is certainly possible . in noguchi",
    "s interpretation , this implies the bar profile is consistent with a bar produced by tidal perturbation .",
    "recent work by @xcite has questioned this interpretation , arguing that the results of @xcite indicate that both profiles occur in isolated systems and that the different profiles are associated with varying bar strengths rather than the triggering mechanism , flatter profiles being produced in stronger bars .",
    "our analysis of ngc  5218 gave an estimated pattern speed for the bar of @xmath192 @xmath10 kpc@xmath7 .",
    "studies by @xcite show that in weak tidal perturbations the properties of the bar depend largely on the internal structure of the host galaxy , rather than the speed of the perturber ( see also simulations by ) .",
    "however , for stronger tidal perturbations the pattern speed is dependent on the perturber mass ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite argue that for the strongest perturbations tidally induced bars can rotate slowly with an inner lindblad resonance near the bar ends , whereas bars produced by weaker perturbations have no inner - lindblad resonances , rotate more rapidly , and end near co - rotation . in the case of ngc  5218 we inferred that there are no inner - lindblad resonances , and that if the bar - ends are co - rotating its angular velocity is @xmath193 @xmath10 kpc@xmath7 .",
    "however , since the @xmath147 curve provides a relatively constant resonance throughout the galactic radii at a velocity of 10 @xmath10 kpc@xmath7 , we can not exclude the possibility that the bar in ngc  5218 is rotating at this , much slower velocity , and ending before co - rotation .",
    "a number of investigations of tidal triggering of bar formation have looked at the relationship between strength of interaction and bar formation @xcite .",
    "quantitative comparison between these simulations and our results is difficult since many of the results are sensitive to the mass concentration of the disk and the disk - to - halo mass fraction which are difficult to constrain observationally .",
    "nonetheless , we can make some important observations about this system .",
    "given the apparently low mass ratio of ngc  5216 to ngc  5218 ( @xmath194 using @xmath2-band data , section  [ 104_sim.sec ] ) , the perigalactic separation required to produce a tidal perturbation of sufficient strength to induce bar formation is likely to be small .",
    "the necessity of a small perigalactic separation is consistent with the simulations , which indicate that production of the extended tidal features observed in the distribution require a small perigalactic separation .",
    "the gas surface density in the central kiloparsec of ngc  5218 ( 1300 m@xmath41 pc@xmath82 ) is significantly larger than the mean of both the unbarred ( @xmath195 m@xmath41 pc@xmath82 ) and barred sample ( @xmath196 m@xmath41 pc@xmath82 ) of @xcite .",
    "the enhanced surface density observed in ngc  5218 can be accounted for by an additional molecular gas mass of the order of @xmath197 m@xmath41 .",
    "estimates of gas inflow rates in barred galaxies vary widely ; adopting the value inferred by @xcite of @xmath198 m@xmath41 yr@xmath7 via calculation of the torques on the molecular gas using near - ir images , we find the time taken to produce the observed enhanced central gas density in ngc  5218 is similar to the time since perigalacticon .",
    "however , it must be remembered the inflow rate is not certain , and may vary with time .      ngc  5218 is a barred interacting spiral galaxy which has undergone a prograde encounter with an elliptical , ngc  5216 , sometime in the recent past .",
    "both the velocity field and the simulations indicate the timescale since perigalacticon is of the order of @xmath199 yr .",

    "this proposition is supported by the following evidence .    *",
    "the large concentration of molecular gas and very high surface density in the central region of ngc  5218 . * a sizable , extended molecular gas component which indicates that the process of gas transfer to the central region is ongoing .",
    "* ngc  5218 s large fir - luminosity and sfr when compared with other galaxies of the same hubble type . * the large @xmath200 ratio , indicating that the current - to - recent star formation in ngc  5218 is larger than an average early - type spiral . * the large @xmath180 ratio in the centre of ngc  5218 implying a large quantity of gas in this region given its size .",
