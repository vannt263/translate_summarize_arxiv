    "the presence of a significant nj quadrupole component and its multiplicity trend have several implications : ( a ) initial - state transverse geometry does not appear to be a useful concept for  collisions as noted above , ( b ) the appearance of a nj quadrupole component in a small system with negligible particle density contradicts the concept of a hydro phenomenon based on particle rescattering and large energy / particle density gradients and ( c ) the same - side `` ridge '' observed in  collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , interpreted by some to suggest `` collectivity '' ( flows ) in small systems , results from an interplay of the jet - related away - side 1d peak and the nj quadrupole that together determine the curvature on azimuth near the origin . when that curvature transitions from positive to negative ( depending on collision energy and other applied cuts ) a same - side `` ridge '' appears .    in a hydro narrative",

    "<S> an established phenomenology and theoretical interpretation of @xmath0-@xmath0 collision data at lower collision energies should provide a reference for @xmath0-@xmath0 and other collision systems at higher energies , against which claims of novel physics may be tested . </S>",
    "<S> the description of @xmath0-@xmath0 collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) has remained incomplete even as claims for collectivity and other novelties in data from smaller systems at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have emerged recently . in this study </S>",
    "<S> we report the charge - multiplicity dependence of two - dimensional ( 2d ) angular correlations and of single - particle ( sp ) densities on transverse rapidity @xmath1 and pseudorapidity @xmath2 from 200 gev @xmath0-@xmath0 collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we define a comprehensive and self - consistent two - component ( soft + hard ) model ( tcm ) for hadron production and report a significant @xmath0-@xmath0 nonjet ( nj ) quadrupole component as a third ( angular - correlation ) component . </S>",
    "<S> our results have implications for @xmath0-@xmath0  centrality , the underlying event ( ue ) , collectivity in small systems and the existence of flows in high - energy nuclear collisions . </S>"
