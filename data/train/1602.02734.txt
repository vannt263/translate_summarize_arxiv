    "a wide range of phenomena in physics , biology , chemistry and materials science are caused by strong spatial variations in thermodynamic quantities , such as pressure or temperature , on a microscopic scale .",
    "some of these effects are related to temperature gradients which may , for instance , be induced by ultrasonic insonation  @xcite or heated nanoparticles  @xcite .",
    "the peltier effect as well as the soret effect both fall in this category  @xcite .",
    "another effect , which has received considerable attention recently , is the thermo - polarisation effect  @xcite . using non - equilibrium molecular dynamics ( nemd ) simulations , bresme and co - workers demonstrated that water molecules align in response to an imposed temperature gradient , leading to electrostatic fields as high as @xmath3  v / m for gradients of 5  k /   @xcite .",
    "in addition , they were able to confirm that the electric field scales linearly with the temperature gradient  @xcite in accordance with the theoretical predictions of non - equilibrium thermodynamics ( net )  @xcite .    in molecular simulations ,",
    "coulomb interactions are regularly treated via ewald summation  @xcite ( including approximations to it ) or a form of truncated interactions  @xcite . in most studies on the thermo - polarisation effect  @xcite",
    ", electrostatic interactions were handled with the truncated , short - ranged wolf method  @xcite .",
    "it was argued that ewald summation can introduce artifacts , which can be avoided by using the short - ranged method  @xcite .",
    "very recently , however , bresme and co - workers found that the wolf method overestimates the induced electric field in a spherical droplet of water by an order of magnitude as compared to ewald summation  @xcite .    the wolf method and other short - ranged methods  @xcite are attractive because they achieve linear scaling with the number of particles as compared to the fastest approximations to ewald summation , such as particle - mesh ewald , which scale as @xmath4  @xcite",
    "however , it is well known that truncation of long - ranged coulomb interactions in simulations can lead to severe artifacts  @xcite . in particular",
    ", short - ranged methods often fail for heterogeneous systems containing interfaces , even though they are known to perform well in bulk equilibrium simulations provided that the parameters are chosen carefully  @xcite . in simulations of the liquid  vapour interface , for example , the wolf method was found inadequate for predicting the electrostatic potential and dipole orientations , regardless of the choice of parameters  @xcite . in the context of local molecular field ( lmf )",
    "theory it has been demonstrated recently that averaged long - range effects can be taken into account self - consistently through an external potential  @xcite . in this approach",
    ", short - ranged interactions are modelled through a pairwise potential which bears strong similarities to the wolf method  @xcite .",
    "however , in the absence of the external potential the short - ranged method failed to reproduce the correct results as obtained with ewald summation and molecules were found to overorient  @xcite .    here , using a full treatment of electrostatic interactions with ewald summation we investigate the validity of the electric fields and induced orientations observed by bresme and co - workers  @xcite .",
    "the field calculation requires especially careful consideration , as the large body of work published thus far relies on the formulation which is inconsistent with the dynamics of the simulation  @xcite .",
    "the correct calculation of the field requires a modified kernel ( rather than @xmath5 ) that is consistent with the effective truncated coulomb interactions  @xcite .",
    "we discuss this issue in detail and carry out a comparison of the thermally induced fields and multipole moments as obtained both with ewald summation and the wolf method .",
    "another important aspect that deserves consideration , is the spatial averaging of the potential and the field . in order to resolve the spatial variation of these quantities , it is advantageous to consider a quasi one - dimensional setup to enhance sampling . usually , the charge density is first spatially averaged over small slabs ( bins ) and then convoluted with an appropriate kernel to obtain , for example , the potential  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the potential calculated in this way does , in general , not represent the exact average over the individual bin .",
    "however , as we demonstrate in this work , calculating the exact analytical average can be done straightforwardly for both summation methods and can lead to huge reductions in the error bars for low resolutions .",
    "therefore , this approach frees us from the constraint of employing an unnecessarily high , submolecular resolution .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : electrostatics ] , we briefly summarise the electrostatic kernels for ewald summation and the wolf method , respectively , and discuss important differences using a simple model system . then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : spatavg ] , we reduce the three - dimensional problem to one spatial dimension employing symmetry properties of the setup .",
    "the two different multipole expansions considered in this work are derived in sec .",
    "[ sec : multi ] .",
    "the simulation protocol is explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : sim ] and all simulation results are presented in sec .  [",
    "sec : res ] .",
    "in md simulations , periodic boundary conditions ( pbcs ) are usually employed to reduce finite - size or surface effects  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the simulated system is infinite , but can be fully described with knowledge of the state of a reference box .",
    "the electrostatic potential , @xmath6 , is governed by poisson s equation , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the charge density and all quantities are expressed in gaussian units .",
    "one way of determining the potential is to solve this equation directly for the fictitious infinite system .",
    "alternatively , the task can be mapped onto the problem of finding a generalised kernel or green s function , @xmath9 , compatible with a finite volume with pbcs , considering nearest images only  @xcite .",
    "once @xmath9 is known , the potential and the field can then be calculated as @xmath10 and @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the simulation box of volume @xmath13 . throughout this work",
    ", we assume that pbcs are explicitly taken into account whenever expressions that depend on an argument of the form @xmath14 are evaluated  ( see for example appendix  [ secapp : electrostatics ] ) .",
    "although both approaches lead to the same result , there is an important conceptual difference : in the former case , we consider the infinite system of charges interacting with the potential that scales as @xmath5 ( in three dimensions ) plus surface term , whereas in the latter case , we only consider the charge distribution in our reference box with an effective interaction .",
    "the periodicity of the setup is then fully mimicked by the green s function , which no longer decays as @xmath5 and is not even spherically symmetric .",
    "let us consider a charge - neutral system consisting of @xmath15 molecules each comprising @xmath16 partial charges @xmath17 located at positions @xmath18 ( @xmath19 labels molecules and @xmath20 sites within a molecule ) .",
    "the total electrostatic energy is then given by  @xcite @xmath21 \\nonumber \\\\ &   & & + \\frac 12 \\sum_{j}\\sum_{\\alpha } q_{j                           \\alpha}^2 \\lim_{r \\to 0 } \\left [ g(\\mathbold r ) -                           \\frac{1}{r } \\right ] , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the distance vector between the nearest pair of images , @xmath23 and @xmath24 is a @xmath25-dimensional vector . in the above equation",
    "we have omitted the summation bounds for readibility .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ufromg ] ) the surface term of de leeuw and co - workers  @xcite has been omitted , because we employ conducting ( tin - foil ) boundary conditions .",
    "we can see that the functional form of @xmath9 directly affects the forces , which are calculated from the negative gradient of the energy , and therefore the dynamics of the simulation . in",
    "what follows , we briefly summarise the kernels for ewald summation and the wolf method .      ewald summation is a numerical approximation to the exact solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : poisson ] ) for pbcs , whose green s function is formally given by @xmath26 here , the summation extends over reciprocal vectors @xmath27 with components @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is an integer and @xmath30 the box size in direction @xmath20 . introducing the convergence factor @xmath31 , the expression is split up into two terms ,",
    "one of which is converted back to real space .",
    "this leads to the representation  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a shift vector between a molecule and its periodic image and the summation runs over all periodic images .",
    "choosing @xmath34 carefully , it is possible to achieve fast convergence of the first sum and small contributions for @xmath35 . if we ignore these terms and introduce a spherical cutoff , @xmath36 , for better performance , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ga ] ) finally reduces to @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the heaviside function . inserting this expression back into eq .",
    "( [ eq : ufromg ] ) yields the standard ewald summation expression  @xcite as presented in textbooks , e.g.  in ref .  .",
    "wolf and co - workers showed that in a condensed ionic system the net coulomb potential is effectively short - ranged  @xcite . based on this insight",
    ", they devised a summation method that avoids the expensive _",
    "k_-space term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gesim ] ) altogether . instead",
    ", the potential is damped and shifted in a way that enforces charge neutrality within the cutoff sphere for improved convergence properties .",
    "the corresponding kernel is given by @xmath39    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and reproduces the correct madelung energy as suggested by wolf and co - workers  @xcite . later",
    "the method was extended to eliminate also higher - order multipoles inside the cutoff sphere  @xcite .",
    "however , it was pointed out that the entire approach embodies certain assumptions on the underlying physical system  @xcite , such as the availability of charges outside the cutoff region for screening  @xcite .",
    "whether these assumptions are reasonable is not always clear a priori , especially for inhomogeneuous systems such as the one considered in this work .",
    "we note that the first term in @xmath40 is identical to the one in @xmath41 , although the optimal choice of the damping parameter , @xmath42 , is not necessarily the same as for ewald summation",
    ". a good value can be found by analysing the convergence of the madelung energy per ion  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the wolf method the force is not exactly given by the negative gradient of the potential energy .",
    "the reason for this inconsistency is that the expression @xmath43 is used for the evaluation rather than @xmath44 in order for the force to vanish at the cutoff distance  @xcite .",
    "there are extensions of the wolf method which address this issue  ( for example ref .  ) . however , given a reasonable combination of damping parameter and cutoff value",
    ", we expect the effects of this inconsistency on the electric field to be negligible .      to illustrate the difference between the electrostatic kernels , we consider a test case based on calculating the potential generated by a single spc / e water  @xcite molecule .",
    "this simple example should draw attention to the fact that , for an identical arrangement of charges , the results for the wolf method sensitively depend on the choice of kernel , damping parameter and cutoff radius . the quality of the wolf approximation to the electrostatic potential , computed according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) , is assessed by comparison with the results of ewald summation , which approximates the exact solution .",
    "considering only a single molecule may seem atypical for the wolf method , since it relies on the idea that long - range contributions average out in a dense system .",
    "however , this comparison serves as a guideline for the choice of new parameters which help us to reduce the dependence on this crucial assumption .",
    "this is achieved by tuning the potential to get better agreement with ewald summation already on the level of a single molecule .",
    "the comparison in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] will then allow us to assess the performance of the wolf method for a wider range of parameters , but it is not the intention of this work to single out an optimal choice .",
    "figure  [ fig : phispcemodel ] shows the potential due to a single spc / e water molecule in a fully periodic system .",
    "the molecule is located at the centre of a rectangular simulation box with dimensions @xmath45 .",
    "the three charges , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the elementary charge , are located in the @xmath49plane at positions @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "ewald summation was carried out taking @xmath52 with @xmath53 , and choosing the set of @xmath54-vectors for eq .",
    "( [ eq : gesim ] ) such that the estimated relative error of the force was approximately @xmath55 . for the wolf method , we compare two sets of parameters : @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the latter combination was employed by armstrong and bresme  @xcite and the former with considerably weaker damping and a larger cutoff is added for comparison .",
    "we note that we also investigated the effects of a large cutoff combined with strong damping , i.e. @xmath58 .",
    "however , we did not observe any substantial differences for the main results of this work compared with the @xmath59 cutoff and therefore omitted the comparison .",
    "( dotted lines ) and @xmath60 ( dashed lines ) . with increasing distance from the origin ,",
    "the isolines of the potential correspond to the values @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively . ]",
    "it is obvious that for the strong damping ( dashed lines ) the potential decays too quickly as compared to the result we get with ewald summation ( solid lines ) .",
    "only the short - range behaviour in the immediate vicinity of the molecule is captured correctly .",
    "the weaker damping parameter ( dotted lines ) , on the other hand , yields a reasonable agreement with ewald summation within a distance of about 6   from the origin , but shows some deviation further away .",
    "employing even lower values for @xmath42 , for example @xmath66 , reduces the discrepancy between the outermost contour lines only minimally ( not shown ) . since the value of the potential represented by the lowest contour level in fig .",
    "[ fig : phispcemodel ] corresponds to only @xmath67 of the highest one , we conclude that the parameters @xmath56 yield a reasonable approximation to the ewald result within the cutoff sphere of @xmath59 .",
    "validation of both sets of parameters in bulk simulations also reveals good agreement with ewald summation ( see appendix  [ secapp : valid ] ) .",
    "once the method to treat electrostatic interactions is chosen and optimised , one typically wishes to improve the statistics of the collected averages . for this purpose",
    "a simulation setup with high spatial symmetry is advantageous  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the case where the underlying three - dimensional problem can be reduced to one spatial dimension , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : box ] .",
    "for such a system , the average charge density can only depend on @xmath68 for sufficiently long simulation times , because the system is isotropic in all other directions .",
    "therefore , this approach is justified only if one considers sufficiently long simulations .",
    "assuming @xmath69 , we can then rewrite eq .",

    "the above integrals can be evaluated readily for ewald summation and the wolf method ( see appendix  [ secapp : electrostatics ] ) .",
    "the results can be improved considerably by averaging the potential and the microscopic field over small spatial regions , such that we obtain the macroscopic maxwell field for the latter .",
    "the centre of each control volume then represents its exact spatial average . to this end",

    "since we only consider the multipole moments @xmath101 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , from now on we omit the subscripts for readability .",
    "in general , the multipole moments depend on the way the charge distribution is partitioned  @xcite and consequently the multipole densities for slabs and molecules are not directly comparable . for example , the quadrupole moment of a reference bin will , in general , not be equal to the sum of the molecular quadrupole moments .",
    "furthermore , we make an intentional , small mistake in the evaluation of @xmath120 and @xmath121 for the sake of computational convenience , because we ignore the precise location of the molecular moments within the bin @xmath77 .",

    "we recall that the latter approach corresponds to averaging the charge density first and integrating it with the appropriate kernel afterwards [ eq .  ( [ eq : avgphimulticontr])a ] .",

    "the error ratio approaches unity implying that both methods become comparable , which is the expected behaviour in the limit @xmath173 . at the same time",
    "the magnitude of the error naturally increases for higher resolutions because fewer molecules contribute to a particular bin ( for 400 bins the maximum error increases by about @xmath174 as compared to the resolution of 40 bins shown in the figure ) .",
    "given that molecules point , on average , in opposite directions for the two electrostatic kernels ( fig .",

    "for both electrostatic kernels ( figs  [ fig : phimulticomb]a - b ) we found the monopole contribution ( black curve ) to capture the exact potential ( red line ) reasonably well for the chosen spatial resolution ( @xmath169 , @xmath170 ) .",

    "in fact , for ewald summation we recover the exact potential almost perfectly , whereas we observe an overshoot inside the hot reservoir for the wolf method .",

    "the situation changes entirely for the molecule expansion shown in figs  [ fig : phimulticomb]c - d , where the monopole contribution is zero . for ewald summation ( fig .",

    "however , close to the hot reservoir the quadrupole contribution ( blue curve ) outweighs the dipole contribution causing the slope of the overall potential to be negative and therefore the field to be positive . in the vicinity of the cold reservoir the dipole contribution dominates over the quadrupole contribution and",
    "the field is negative .",
    "the sum of both terms ( red circles ) agrees perfectly with the exact average ( red line ) . for the wolf method we found that the quadrupole density constitutes a much smaller correction to the dipole contribution which is almost negligible outside the reservoirs",
    "this might seem surprising at first given that the results for the quadrupole densities agree well for both summation methods ( fig .",

    "the apparent contradiction is explained by the fact that the derivatives of the kernels in the evaluation of the potential are very different for both methods .",

    "[ subsec : respol ] when we discuss the macroscopic polarisation .    with regard to the accuracy of the full multipole approximations ( up to the quadrupole term ) , we observed different trends for the maximum error of the potential within each expansion . for the slab expansion we found the maximum error to be about 6 times larger than the error of the exact potential for the lowest resolution ( @xmath175 , @xmath176 ) . upon increasing the resolution , the error ratio approaches unity , which is the expected behaviour .",

    "close to the hot reservoir , the short - ranged method overshoots the ewald summation result for low damping and vice versa for high damping .",
    "we also infer from the figure that the field changes its sign in the vicinity of the cold reservoir . from the discussion of the potentials in the previous section ( fig .",

    "<S> finally , we propose a more accurate way of calculating the electrostatic potential and the field . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that averaging the microscopic field analytically to obtain the macroscopic maxwell field reduces the error bars by up to an order of magnitude . as a consequence , the simulation times required to reach a given statistical accuracy decrease by up to two orders of magnitude .    </S>",
