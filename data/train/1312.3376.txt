    "recently , quantum systems and their classical wave counterparts featuring the @xmath0 ( parity - time ) symmetry , supported by the balance between spatially separated gain and loss terms , have drawn a great deal of attention , as reviewed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this context , the straightforward similarity between the schrdinger equation in quantum mechanics and the paraxial propagation equation in optics has made it possible to propose  @xcite and demonstrate in experiments @xcite that the @xmath0 symmetry can be implemented in terms of the optical - beam propagation in waveguides with appropriately placed and mutually balanced gain and loss .",
    "the optical realizations of the @xmath0 symmetry make it natural to extend this concept to nonlinear settings @xcite .",
    "in particular , solitons can be supported by the combination of the kerr nonlinearity and spatially periodic complex potentials , whose odd imaginary part accounts for the balanced gain and loss , thus accounting for the @xmath1  symmetry .",
    "a detailed analysis demonstrates the existence of stability regions for such @xmath0-symmetric solitons , both bright @xcite and dark ones @xcite , as well as for two - dimensional vortices  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one - dimensional @xcite and two - dimensional @xcite bright @xmath1-symmetric solitons , and their one - dimensional dark counterparts @xcite can be built as stable objects in dual - core couplers , with the balanced gain and loss placed in the different cores .",
    "stable bright solitons were also predicted in @xmath0-symmetric settings with the second - harmonic - generating ( quadratic ) nonlinearity chi2 .",
    "another class of nonlinear @xmath0-symmetric systems is represented by a pair of discrete ( delta - functional ) gain and loss elements stuttgart , or the _ gain - loss dipole _",
    ", with the imaginary part of the potential represented by the @xmath2 function of the coordinate @xcite , which are embedded into a continuous medium with the cubic nonlinearity . the model with the the gain - loss dipole admits a full family of exact analytical solutions for solitons pinned to the @xmath1 dipole .",
    "further , discrete solitons were predicted in various chains of linear discrete and circular @xcite coupled @xmath0-symmetric elements and , more generally , in networks of coupled @xmath0-symmetric _ oligomers _ ( dimers , quadrimers , etc . )  @xcite .",
    "parallel to incorporating the usual kerr nonlinearity into the conservative part of the @xmath0 system , its gain - loss - antisymmetric part can be made nonlinear too , by introducing mutually balanced cubic gain and loss terms @xcite .",
    "this can be done in the simplest way in the context of discrete systems , by embedding nonlinear cores into linear chains @xcite .",
    "effects of combined linear and nonlinear @xmath0  terms on the existence and stability of optical solitons were studied too combined .",
    "although @xmath0-symmetric models belong , generally speaking , to the class of dissipative systems , the fact that they give rise to _ continuous _ families of modes , which exist due to the balance between the separated gain and loss with equal strengths , makes them similar to conservative systems .",
    "the @xmath0-symmetry of the modes gets broken with the increase of the gain - loss coefficient . above the critical value of this coefficient",
    ", the solution typically undergoes blowup  @xcite , due to the onset of the imbalance between the linear gain and loss . on the other hand , in the presence of the nonlinear @xmath0-balanced gain and loss terms , the symmetry breaking of the solutions may lead to the formation of a self - trapped asymmetric mode , rather than the blowup @xcite .",
    "however , in the latter case the modes exist as _ isolated attractors _ ( rather than continuous families ) , like in generic nonlinear dissipative systems , i.e. , the @xmath0 symmetry is broken in that case too .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to introduce nonlinear systems with double symmetries , @xmath0 and spatial , and explore results of the interplay between these symmetries .",
    "the simplest example of such a setting , which we construct and analyze here , are _ bi - dimers _ ,",
    "i.e. , pairs of two linearly coupled @xmath0-symmetric dimers with the on - site cubic nonlinearity .",
    "two types of this setting are possible , both considered below : _",
    "straight_- and _ cross_-coupled ones , in which , respectively , the gain and loss elements of one dimer are coupled to their counterparts in the parallel one , or , alternatively , the two dimers are set anti - parallel to each other , the gain pole of one being coupled to its lossy counterpart in the other . in earlier works ,",
    "similar configurations were considered either for equal couplings between all the sites  @xcite , or for special cases ( e.g. , cross - coupled dimers for a special form of unequal couplings were touched upon in ref .",
    "none of the earlier considered bi - dimer settings included the above - mentioned nonlinear @xmath0-symmetric gain / loss terms , which are a part of the models introduced in the present work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we formulate the  models of the straight- and cross - coupled bi - dimers .",
    "we report partial analytical and systematic numerical results , varying the linear gain / loss parameter , @xmath3 , in the presence of the nonlinear gain and loss terms with coefficient @xmath4 , for varieties of stationary modes in the straight- and cross - coupled bi - dimers in sections iii and iv , respectively . in particular , the cross - coupled bi - dimer with the two linear - coupling constants equal to each other may be considered as a @xmath0__-hypersymmetric _ _ quadrimer .",
    "the paper is concluded by section v , which also puts forward directions for future studies .",
    "we introduce a system of two linearly coupled @xmath0-symmetric dipoles , each one represented by complex variables @xmath5 , where subscripts @xmath6 and @xmath7 stand for the gain and loss sites , while superscripts @xmath8 and @xmath9 refer to the dipole s number .",

    "however , it is worthy to note that , unlike the other unstable branches , which were considered above , whose amplitudes blow up due to the instability , the evolution of solutions associated with the thick red branch is quite different .",
    "it leads at first to a breakup of the @xmath0 symmetry , bringing the pair of amplitudes , @xmath97 , very close to zero .",

    "the second configuration is the cross - coupled bi - dimer , with each of the gain sites coupled to two lossy ones .",

    ", we have identified a number of solutions analytically , including those keeping both the spatial and the @xmath0-symmetries unbroken , as well as solutions that break one of these symmetries .",
    "these solutions present a number of noteworthy features , in terms of the bifurcation theory .",
    "in particular , symmetry - breaking and saddle - center bifurcations were found in these settings .",
    "instabilities typically lead to blowup of the solutions , but examples of convergence to another attractor were also identified .",
    "these fundamental systems may be used as building blocks to construct lattices consisting of either straight- or cross - coupled bi - dimers , which should be a natural next step of the analysis .",

    "<S> ' '' ''    the subject of the work are pairs of linearly coupled @xmath0-symmetric dimers . </S>",
    "<S> two different settings are introduced , namely , _ </S>",
    "<S> _ straight - coupled dimer__s , where each gain site is linearly coupled to one gain and one loss site , and _ cross - coupled dimers _ , with each gain site coupled to two lossy ones . </S>",
    "<S> the latter pair with equal coupling coefficients represents a @xmath0-_hypersymmetric _ quadrimer . </S>",
    "<S> we find symmetric and antisymmetric solutions in these systems , chiefly in an analytical form , and explore the existence , stability and dynamical behavior of such solutions by means of numerical methods . </S>",
    "<S> we thus identify bifurcations occurring in the systems , including spontaneous symmetry breaking and saddle - center bifurcations . </S>",
    "<S> simulations demonstrate that evolution of unstable branches typically leads to blowup . </S>",
    "<S> however , in some cases unstable modes rearrange into stable ones .    ' '' '' </S>"
