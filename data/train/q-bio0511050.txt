    "unveiling how neuronal activity represents and processes sensory information remains a very difficult problem , despite theoretical and experimental efforts undertaken by neuroscientists for the last several decades ( for a recent review , see  @xcite ) . in this broad context , relatively little attention has been devoted to the question of how organisms cope with the several orders of magnitude spanned by the intensities of sensory stimuli  @xcite .",
    "this astonishing ability is most easily revealed in humans by classical results in psychophysics  @xcite : the perception of the intensity of a given stimulus is experimentally shown to depend on the stimulus intensity @xmath3 as @xmath4 ( weber - fechner law ) or @xmath5 ( stevens law ) , where the stevens exponent @xmath6 is typically @xmath7 .",
    "those laws have in common the fact that they are _ response functions with broad dynamic range _ , i.e. they map several decades of stimuli into a single decade of response .",
    "one would like to understand how this broad dynamic range is physically achieved by neuron assemblies .",
    "recent experimental evidence suggests that electrical coupling among neurons in the early layers of sensory systems plays an essential role in weak stimulus detection .",
    "deans et al .",
    "@xcite showed that electrical coupling is present in the mammalian retina via gap junctions ( ionic channels that connect neighboring cells ) .",
    "in particular , the spiking response of ganglion cells to light stimulus changes dramatically when the gap junctions are genetically knocked out : both sensitivity and dynamic range are reduced  @xcite .",
    "another example comes from the olfactory system .",
    "the spiking response of isolated olfactory sensory neurons ( osns ) to varying odorant concentration usually presents a narrow dynamic range  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast with the response observed in the next layers of the olfactory bulb : both the glomerular  @xcite and mitral cell  @xcite responses present a broader dynamic range than the osns . in this case",
    ", the tightly packed unmyelinated axons of osns in the olfactory nerve are believed to interact electrically via ephaptic interactions  @xcite ( i.e. mediated by current flow through the extracellular space ) , as shown by bokil et al .  @xcite . in particular , their results indicate that a spike in a single axon can evoke spikes in all other axons of the bundle , suggesting that some computation is performed prior to the glomerular layer .    motivated by these results ,",
    "previous papers have shown through numerical simulations that electrical coupling among neurons indeed changes the response function in a way that is consistent with experimental results . due to the coupling ,",
    "stimuli generate excitable waves which propagate through the neuron population .",
    "the interplay between wave creation and wave annihilation leads to a nonlinear amplification of the spiking response , increasing the sensitivity at low input levels _ and _ enhancing the dynamic range  @xcite . in one dimension ,",
    "the robustness of the mechanism is attested by the diversity of models employed : either the biophysically realistic hodgkin - huxley equations  @xcite , a lattice of nonlinear coupled maps  @xcite , or the greenberg - hastings cellular automata ( ghca )  @xcite yield qualitatively similar results .",
    "the same phenomenon has recently been observed in simulations with the two - dimensional ghca  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the response of excitable ghca model neurons  @xcite , where the bidirectional ( electrical ) coupling is modeled by a probability @xmath8 of spike transmission . while the uncoupled case @xmath9 can be exactly solved , the coupled case @xmath10 is handled within two mean field approximations , namely at the single - site and pair levels .",
    "the aim is to shed light on the analytical behavior of the response function for the one - dimensional case , therefore building on previous efforts which have relied entirely on numerical simulations .",
    "our focus on the _ response _ of a _ continuously driven _ spatially extended excitable system should be carefully confronted with other recent studies , where the main interest has been on phase transitions between an excitable and a self - sustained collective state .",
    "for instance , the sirs model of epidemics in hypercubic lattices has been recently investigated under the mean field and pair approximations  @xcite . in those contagion models ,",
    "stationary self - sustained activity becomes stable for sufficiently strong connection among neighbors , a behavior which has been shown to be universal under very general assumptions  @xcite .",
    "similar results have been obtained for a variety of neuronal models , including collective responses to a localized transient stimulus  @xcite , as well as the emergence of sustained activity in complex networks  @xcite .    while interesting in its own , the framework of stable - unstable collective transitions does not seem particularly suited for our modeling purposes . to account for sensory responses ,",
    "the employed ghca model is an excitable system which always returns to its absorbing state in the absence of stimulus , there are no phase transitions .",
    "the refractory period of the ghca model neurons is absolute ( unlike , say , reaction - diffusion lattices ) , mimicking the deterministic behavior of continuous - time systems like the hodgkin - huxley equations or integrate - and - fire models  @xcite .",
    "the only source of stochasticity of the model regards the firing of the neurons .",
    "stimuli can come from spiking neighbors ( with probability @xmath8 ) or from an `` external '' source , which is modeled by a poisson process and represents sensory input .",
    "therefore , in the limit @xmath11 the dynamics is that of a _ deterministic _ excitable lattice being _ stochastically stimulated _ , which casts the problem into the framework of probabilistic cellular automata  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ model ] , the ghca rules are described ; section  [ uncoupled ] contains the exact calculations for the response of uncoupled neurons , while in sections  [ coupled ]  and  [ coupledpair ] results for the coupled case are discussed in the mean field and pair approximations , respectively . our concluding remarks are presented in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "in the @xmath0-state ghca model  @xcite for excitable systems , the instantaneous membrane potential of the @xmath12-th cell ( @xmath13 ) at discrete time @xmath14 is represented by @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the state @xmath17 denotes a neuron at its resting ( polarized ) potential , @xmath18 represents a spiking ( depolarizing ) neuron and @xmath19 account for the afterspike refractory period ( hyperpolarization ) .",
    "we employ the simplest rules of the automaton : if @xmath17 , then @xmath20 only if there is a supra - threshold stimulus at site @xmath12 ; otherwise , @xmath21 . if @xmath22 , then @xmath23 , regardless of the stimulus . in other words , the rules state that a neuron only spikes",
    "if stimulated , after which it undergoes an absolute refractory period before returning to rest .",
    "whether the neurons are isolated or coupled is implicit in the definition of the supra - threshold stimulus .",
    "we assume _ external _ supra - threshold stimuli to be a poisson process with rate @xmath3 ( events per second ) .",
    "hence at each time step an external stimulus arrives with probability @xmath24 per neuron .",
    "notice that @xmath25  ms corresponds to the approximate duration of a spike and is the time scale adopted for the time step of the model .",
    "the number of states @xmath0 therefore controls the duration of the refractory period ( which corresponds to @xmath26 , in ms ) . in the biological context , @xmath3 could be related for example with the concentration of a given odorant presented to an olfactory epithelium  @xcite , or the light intensity stimulating a retina  @xcite",
    ". we shall refer to @xmath3 as the stimulus rate or intensity .",
    "when electrically coupled , neurons at rest can also be stimulated by their neighbors .",
    "we define @xmath8 and @xmath27 as the probabilities that a resting neuron spikes as a consequence of transmission ( ionic current flow ) from respectively one or two spiking neighbors [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : p1coupled ] ) ] .",
    "we keep @xmath8 and @xmath27 as two independent parameters in most calculations to show the robustness of some asymptotic results . in the simulations , we concentrate on the more physically intuitive choice of @xmath28 , where the contributions from two spiking neighbors are independent .",
    "let @xmath29 be the probability that the @xmath12-th neuron is in state @xmath30 at time @xmath14 .",
    "since the dynamics of the refractory state is deterministic , the equations for @xmath31 are simply    @xmath32    to describe the coupling among first neighbors , let @xmath33 be the joint probability that sites @xmath34 , @xmath12 and @xmath35 are respectively in the states @xmath30 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 at time @xmath14 . following the definitions of @xmath38 , @xmath8 and @xmath27 above , the equation for @xmath39 thus becomes    @xmath40p_{t}^{(i)}(1,0,1 ) \\nonumber \\\\   & & + [ 1-(1-\\lambda)(1-p)]\\left(\\sum_{k\\neq 1}^{n-1}p_{t}^{(i)}(1,0,k ) \\right .",

    "( [ eq : refrac]-[eq : norm ] ) and in what follows .",

    "the difficulties of a quantitative match are not surprising : the retina is organized in layers which have , to first order , a two - dimensional structure , signal processing from the photoreceptors to the ganglion cells involves a complex intermediate neuronal circuit ( with bipolar , horizontal and amacrine cells  @xcite ) , and individual neurons themselves can have subtle dynamical properties ( such as adaptation , for instance ) .",
