    "starting from its first formulation in 1992 , the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) has rapidly established itself as the leading numerical method in the simulation of statical and dynamical properties of strongly correlated one - dimensional quantum systems@xcite .",
    "the versatility of this approach allowed the extension of dmrg applications to fields quite far from those it was originally designed to address , e.g. the quantum chemistry of small to medium - sized molecules@xcite .",
    "a deeper understanding of the mechanisms which contribute in making dmrg such a successful tool has been achieved recently , when this technique was shown to be equivalent to a variational approach over the set of matrix product states ( mpss)@xcite . the latter were originally named `` finitely correlated states '' , due to their intrinsic ability in capturing the internal structure of many - body quantum states having exponentially decaying correlations@xcite .",
    "remarkably it has been found that the ground state of the one - dimensional aklt model is exactly given by a mps@xcite , thus stimulating a plethora of investigations in the quantum many - body realm ( e.g. see refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "the mps architecture is so immediate and powerful that in some cases it is even amenable to analytical studies , providing an exact , and often _ optimal _",

    "slater determinants correspond to product states of ( say ) @xmath0 fermions where each fermion occupies a different single - particle orbital out of an orthonormal set ( typically solution of a mean - field hamiltonian ) .",
    "they are the starting point of most many - body calculations ( e.g. _ ab - initio _ hartree - fock and post - hartree - fock methods)@xcite and , even though lacking true electron - electron correlations , their characterization poses significant problems when working on a configuration space for which the single - particle orbitals entering the determinant are not local ( by this we mean that the latter might have extended and non - mutually excluding supports in a wavefunction basis chosen a priori ) . for this reason , most previous attempts to address quantum chemistry problems with dmrg@xcite , and more in general with tensor network variational structures@xcite , agreed on adopting the hartree - fock basis as the selected configuration space for the correlation calculus .",
    "in the present work , we step back from this assumption , and show that that the description can be kept simple and manageable even when the chosen configuration basis is not related to the solutions of the one - body problem .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    ", we provided the exact representation of a ( delocalized orbital ) creation operator as an mpo , which we checked to be optimal in terms of the refinement parameter . stacking these mpo leads to the description of the uncorrelated many - body states quite automatically .",
    "the representation we introduced is tailored upon fermionic exchange statistics , but it generalizes easily to particles obeying any abelian exchange statistic .",
    "also , it leads to a compact and simple tensor network representation of the many body transformation corresponding to one - body basis change . finally , we discussed some possible extension of the previous description to embed also states carrying a controlled amount of many - body correlation , such as ci states .",
    "we provided some proposals for the simplest cases and argued that there is no unique , highly - compatible and optimal solution .",
    "we conclude by arguing that , while the tensor network representation proposal we tailored in this paper was based on a one - dimensional qubit lattice , we are positive that similar construction can be adapted to other lattice geometries , as long as some peculiar topological features are preserved . in particular , we are thinking about finitely correlated states on cayley trees@xcite , sharing with 1d obc systems the fact that no closed loops in the geometry are present .",
