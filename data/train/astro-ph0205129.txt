    "one of the principal motivations for undertaking a proper - motion survey is to construct a reduced proper motion ( rpm ) diagram , in which the rpm @xmath1 , is plotted against color . here",
    "@xmath2 is the apparent magnitude and @xmath3 is the proper motion measured in arcsec per year .",
    "the rpm serves as a rough proxy for the absolute magnitude @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the parallax measured in arcsec . indeed ,",
    "if all stars had the same transverse speed , the rpm diagram would be identical to a conventional color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) up to a zero - point offset .",
    "hence , one can hope to roughly classify stars using a rpm diagram , even when one has no parallax or spectroscopic information .",
    "in particular , subdwarfs ( sds ) should be especially easy to distinguish from main - sequence ( ms ) stars , since they are several magnitudes dimmer at the same color , and are generally moving several times faster .",
    "each of these effects tends to move sds several magnitudes below the ms on a rpm diagram .",
    "white dwarfs ( wds ) should also be easily distinguished from ms stars , since they are typically 10 magnitudes fainter at the same color , and are generally moving at similar velocities . although wds are closer to sds on an rpm than they are to the ms , they still should be distinguishable .",
    "more than two decades after its final compilation , the _ new luyten two - tenths catalog _ ( nltt ) of high proper - motion stars ( @xmath6 ) @xcite , and its better known subset _ luyten half - second catalog _",
    "* lhs ) ( @xmath7 ) continue to be a vital source of astrometric data .",
    "they are still mined for nearby stars @xcite , subdwarfs @xcite , and white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "nltt is by far the largest all - sky catalog of high - proper motion stars with more than 58,000 entries , and it is substantially complete to @xmath8 over most of the sky .",
    "in addition to positions and proper motions ( ppm ) , nltt contains photographic photometry in two bands , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , as well as important notes on some individual stars , particularly binaries .",
    "the combination of nltt photometry and astrometry permits the construction of a rpm diagram",
    ". see figure [ fig : rpml ] . unfortunately , this diagram is almost devoid of features that could be used to isolate individual populations .",
    "there is a clump of stars off to the lower left that one might plausibly identify with wds .",
    "however , there is no obvious separation between sds and ms stars .",
    "moreover , it is common knowledge that reddish wds are mixed in with the sds at intermediate colors , so that wds must be spectroscopically culled from relatively large samples drawn from the lower reaches of this diagram ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are three reasons for this mixing of populations .",
    "first , photographic @xmath11 and @xmath12 do not provide a very broad color baseline .",
    "second , photographic photometry has intrinsically large errors .",
    "third , nltt does not reach even the relatively limited precision that is in principle achievable with photography .",
    "given the steepness of the color - magnitude relations of individual populations , the short color baseline and large errors combine to seriously smear out the diagram .",
    "we are in the process of obtaining improved photometry and astrometry for the great majority of nltt stars . here",
    "we give a very brief summary of our procedure .",
    "details are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for bright stars , we find counterparts to nltt stars in three ppm catalogs : hipparcos @xcite , tycho-2 @xcite , and starnet @xcite .",
    "using this improved astrometry , we easily identify the 2mass @xcite second incremental release counterparts of these stars and so obtain infrared ( ir ) photometry .",
    "hipparcos and tycho-2 have generally excellent optical photometry . for faint stars , we first identify candidate counterparts from usno - a @xcite around the ( circa 1950 epoch ) positions given by nltt , and then ask if there are any 2mass counterparts around the ( circa 2000 epoch ) positions predicted by the usno - a positions and the nltt proper motion .",
    "we use several criteria to ascertain the validity of the nltt / usno - a/2mass match .",
    "thus , we obtain infrared photometry from 2mass , optical photometry from usno - a , and proper motions with typical accuracies of @xmath13 from the difference of positions in the two catalogs . the former allows us to construct the optical - ir color index @xmath0 .",
    "the latter represents a roughly 5-fold improvement relative to the nltt proper - motion errors @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : rpmv ] shows the resulting rpm restricted to @xmath14 , for which the data of @xcite and @xcite are relatively homogeneous . for @xmath15 band",
    "we adopt @xcite @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the photographic magnitudes from usno - a . note",
    "that the sds and ms stars are clearly separated into two tracks , at least for @xmath19 .",
    "the wds are also clearly separated from the other stars .",
    "going towards the bright end , the sd track becomes vertical at @xmath20 and then turns to the right at @xmath21 . for a star having a transverse speed of @xmath22",
    ", this latter value corresponds to @xmath23 , i.e. , roughly a mag below the subdwarf turnoff . in any event ,",
    "the bright end is dominated by hipparcos counterparts of nltt stars ( shown in yellow ) .",
    "hipparcos stars generally have excellent parallaxes , so for them rpms are superfluous .",
    "we therefore remove these stars from further consideration .    using superior color - color plots of nltt stars based on sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) photometry ,",
    "we have checked that the scheme shown in figure [ fig : rpmv ] indeed properly classifies nltt stars that lie in the sdss early data release @xcite area . in a future paper",
    ", we will show how sdss / usno - a data can be combined to classify stars at much lower proper motions than the threshold of nltt .",
    "once stars are classified using the rpm diagram , it is possible to estimate their distances photometrically . using this technique , in table [ table : wds ]",
    "we have tentatively identified 23 wd candidates ] that lie within 20 pc and are not listed in the online edition of the gliese catalog of nearby stars .",
    "these wd candidates are also not listed in @xcite catalog of spectroscopically confirmed wds .",
    "we determine photometric distances from @xmath24 , @xmath0 , and a cmr calibrated using @xcite data .",
    "stars with low values of @xmath25 lie close to the sd / wd discriminator line shown in figure [ fig : rpmv ] , and could therefore be extreme sds ",
    "stars interesting in their own right .",
    "spectroscopy will be ultimately required to confirm the nature of these objects .",
    "if confirmed , these wds would represent a significant addition to 109 wds known to be closer than 20 pc @xcite .",
    "in fact , since for 10 of our candidate wds we calculate @xmath26 pc , they could raise the local density derived by @xcite using a 13 pc sample ( which they believe is complete ) by as much as 20% ( but note that we do not cover the entire sky ) .",
    "panels in figure [ fig : rpmlall ] show respectively where the stars classified as wds , sds , and ms stars in figure [ fig : rpmv ] , lie in the original nltt rpm .",
    "the points representing the wds are enlarged for emphasis .",
    "note that while the region to the lower left is indeed dominated by wds , the red wds are sprinkled among a much higher density of other faint red stars . from the distribution of sds and ms stars",
    "it is clear that while the sds do tend on average to be bluer and fainter than the ms stars , the two populations are severely mixed in the original nltt rpm diagram .",
    "we have presented an optical / ir rpm diagram for nltt stars based on photometry and astrometry obtained from usno - a and 2mass .",
    "wds , sds , and ms stars are well separated in this diagram , at least for stars with rpms @xmath19 .",
    "this should provide a powerful tool for choosing wd and sd candidates from among the 58,845 nltt stars for a variety of studies .",
    "we acknowledge the use of cd - rom versions of usno - a1.0 and a2.0 catalogs provided to us by d.  monet .",
    "this publication makes use of catalogs from the astronomical data center at nasa goddard space flight center , vizier and simbad databases operated at cds , strasbourg , france , and data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the ipac / caltech , funded by the nasa and the nsf .",
