    "the accurate hydrodynamical description of free surface flows , although initiated during the xix@xmath0 , still remains a modern problem of physics .",
    "the difficulties to be overcome are of different sorts . in some situations , like a viscous flow on a slope ,",
    "the governing equations are both well posed and easy to integrate numerically . however , a numerical experiment , although giving access to any measurement , by contrast to actual experiments , does not provide in itself a physical understanding of the system .",
    "most often , theories aiming to enlighten the physical mechanisms at work have been based on low dimensional model equations   like the lubrication approximation for viscous flows ( @xcite ) . in other situations ,",
    "the numerical inegration of the governing equations is not accessible , due to the range of relevant length - scales and time - scales involved .",
    "for instance , the simulation of turbulent flows is currently limited to slightly less than four decades in space while the simulation of a river section would require at least @xmath1 times more mesh - points . even for viscous flows ,",
    "the presence of a moving contact line implies a divergence of the viscous stress regularised at the molecular scale .",
    "five to six decades of length - scales being involved , the simulation of a simple millimetre scale moving droplet is beyond usual computer facilities .",
    "one trick is to introduce a sub - grid model , like for large eddy simulations of turbulence .",
    "another solution consists again in deriving a low dimensional model . in the turbulent case",
    ", one can use the shallow water equations without ( @xcite ) or with a damping term ( @xcite ) . in the viscous case",
    ", the lubrication approximation can be extended to moving contact lines by introducing the slip length ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , there exist situations , like dense granular flows , for which the constitutive relations have not been derived from first principles and are still under debate ( @xcite ) . in the particular case of granular matter",
    ", the depth averaged dynamical equation",
    "  hereafter referred as the saint - venant equation ( @xcite )   has been widely used to bypass the problem . within this framework , instead of prescribing a stress / strain relation , one simply models the friction on the static bed over which grains are flowing ( @xcite ) .    in any flow bounded by a free surface @xmath2 , the idea is to simplify the full set of equations governing the evolution of the velocity @xmath3 ( 3d equations ) into that for the depth averaged velocity @xmath4 ( referred to as ( 2 + 1)d equations ) . to perform this reduction under controlled approximations ,",
    "one usually assumes that the flow is thin , i.e. that the longitudinal variations are negligible in comparison to transverse ones : @xmath5 .",
    "this restricts the validity of the approach to small interface slopes , i.e. @xmath6 . to go beyond this restriction , methods in the spirit of the lubrication approximation",
    "have been developped to recover quantitative results for larger slopes .",
    "for instance , a long - wavelength expansion has been performed by @xcite for wedge - like geometries , where the restriction is on the curvature of the interface , i.e. @xmath7 .",
    "it yields to an equation that is well adapted to treat contact line problems ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , by construction , the lubrication approximation ( even extended to larger slopes ) is lacking important dynamical mechanisms , namely inertial effects and longitudinal diffusion of momentum .",
    "it is therefore unable to give much insight into instability and pattern formation mechanisms .",
    "this is why a lot of numerical models , starting from a long - wave expansion , have been derived since the pioneering work of @xcite in order to study development of waves at the surface of the fluid into large - amplitude strongly non - linear localized structures ( @xcite ) .",
    "assuming that the height of the waves remains small in comparison to their wavelength , i.e. @xmath8 , the interface modulations are expected to be governed by a benney - like equation ( @xcite ) , where the temporal evolution of @xmath9 is expressed as a function of various algebraic powers of @xmath9 and its gradients .",
    "the most recent models ( @xcite ) accurately and economically predict linear and non - linear properties of film flows up to relatively high reynolds numbers .",
    "such developments do not exist for real turbulent or granular flows . in this paper , we show how one can , in a general way , take into account all terms of navier - stokes equations , while keeping the saint - venant projection .",
    "this goal is achieved by looking for approximate solutions ( called below ` test functions ' ) whose form is inferred from that of the exact steady and homogeneous solutions of the original equations , and with which we require that these equations are fulfilled on average only , i.e. integrated over the flow depth . of course , we expect this approach to work well for situations which are not too far from the steady and homogeneous case .",
    "we shall explain the precise development of this integral method in the next section for the case of the well studied viscous flow .",
    "we then turn to more original calculations with the treatment of turbulent and granular flows . for each of these three cases ,",
    "we illustrate our approach with a concrete example of application : the formation of dunes in viscous streams , the transverse velocity profile in turbulent channels and the kapitza instability in dense granular flows .",
    "although we are greatly interested in the physical insights of these different situations , we shall here focus on the technical discussion of the benefits of this approach .",

    "a schematic drawing of the flow with all notations is shown in figure [ schemavisc ] .",
    "combined with the incompressibility equation , the navier - stokes equation provides the theoretical framework that describes the motion of the fluid : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the velocity field , @xmath21 is the pressure divided by the fluid density @xmath22 , @xmath23 the gravity vector and @xmath24 the kinematic viscosity . note that in the entire paper , we assume the density to be constant and omit this @xmath25 factor for simplicity .",

    "same for momentum and stress .",

    "equation ( [ ns ] ) admits a trivial solution corresponding to a steady constant - thickness film .",
    "assuming that all derivatives with respect to @xmath32 , @xmath10 and @xmath12 vanish , there is only a streamwise velocity @xmath28 and the equations reduce to : @xmath33 which , for a film of thickness @xmath34 ( in this homogeneous case , @xmath35 and thus @xmath36 ) , yields to @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the reference pressure .",
    "the next step is to reduce the full equations to a set of two equations governing the evolution of the local depth of the flow @xmath39 . for the sake of simplicity we shall keep to @xmath40 dimensions , but",
    "the following derivation can be easily generalized to ( 2 + 1)d . the local flow rate @xmath16 is defined as : @xmath41 from @xmath16 , we define the mean velocity @xmath17 .",
    "the first of these equations is simply the ( integral ) mass conservation : @xmath42 .",
    "the second one is the projection of the navier - stokes equation integrated over the height of the flow .",
    "it gives an integral momentum conservation equation ( saint - venant equation ) : @xmath43 \\ , dz = \\int_z^h \\left [ g \\sin\\theta - { \\partial_x}p + \\nu \\delta u \\right ] \\ , dz .",
    "\\label{stvenant}\\ ] ] in order to compute these integrals , the vertical profiles are assumed to remain close to those obtained in the homogeneous steady case .",
    "we thus take a parabolic velocity test profile parametrized by @xmath16 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( or @xmath46 ) @xmath47 similarly , the pressure profile remains hydrostatic : @xmath48 we shall turn to the limit of this assumption in the conclusion .",
    "because of the incompressibility relation , we can compute the @xmath11-component of the velocity : @xmath49 an analysis of the order of magnitude of this velocity leads , as expected , to a ratio @xmath50 . in the following we shall then focus on the streamwise component velocity only , as we are interested in situations with a weak bed slope correction to the homogeneous @xmath51 case . using incompressibility as well as the free surface and bottom boundary conditions , one can write the inertial terms as the derivative of the momentum flux : @xmath43 \\ , dz = { \\partial_t}\\int_z^h u \\ , dz + { \\partial_x}\\int_z^h u^2 \\ , dz= { \\partial_t}q + { \\partial_x}\\left ( \\alpha \\frac{q^2}{r } \\right ) .\\ ] ] interestingly",
    ", the value of @xmath52 depends only on the test function and is thus determined in the homogeneous steady case : @xmath53 for the parabolic profile ( [ uparabol ] ) .",
    "the right hand side of the saint - venant equation contains the different forces integrated vertically , namely : + ( i ) the projection of gravity along the streamwise direction , @xmath54 , + ( ii ) the pressure gradient , @xmath55 , + ( iii ) the vertical diffusion of momentum , @xmath56 ( iv ) the streamwise diffusion of momentum , @xmath57 .",

    "one then recovers the standard lubrication equations .",
    "in the right - hand side of equation ( [ streamwisediffmomentum ] ) , one recognizes a term corresponding to the viscous diffusion of @xmath16 .",
    "the three other dissipative terms originate from the geometry of the flow and their interpretation is less straightforward .",
    "the above equation set is very close in spirit to the derivation of @xcite .",
    "other versions of this modeling have been proposed for specific problems ( @xcite ) .",
    "they all keep the same functional form , but with different numerical coefficients , adjusted to match experimental data . by contrast ,",
    "our equations are less quantitative but directly come from the original navier - stokes equations and the different terms have therefore not been modified in an _ ad hoc _",
    "way for some particular purpose .",
    "all dynamical mechanisms are thus present and can be backtracked to get their physical meaning .",
    "the interest of the terms extending the lubrication approximation for the problem of kapitza instability and roll waves has been discussed at length by @xcite .",
    "we refer the interested reader to the review section of that article . in the following we discuss another example : the formation of sand anti - dunes in a viscous stream .",
    "let us first apply our approach to the simple case of a steady flow over a non - uniform bed @xmath13 . from conservation of mass , we infer that the flow rate is uniform along the stream and is equal to : @xmath59 the flow may be usefully characterized by two independent non - dimensional numbers among the following three : the slope @xmath60 , the froude number @xmath61 and the reynolds number @xmath62    in the limit of a small bed amplitude",
    ", one can without loss of generality consider sinusoidal perturbations of the form @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the wavenumber rescaled by the flow height .",

    ", we get : @xmath69 combining the first and last equations , we obtain the deformation of the free surface as a function of that of the bed .",
    "@xmath70     and @xmath71 .",
    "the free surface profiles have been plotted for a low froude number ( b ) and for a high one ( c ) . ]    in figure [ phaseetamplitudevisc ] , we plot the amplitude and the phase of the free surface profile with respect to the sinusoidal bed deformations as functions of the froude number . due to viscous",
    "damping , the bed and the free surface are out of phase essentially close to a unit froude number , and the amplitude of the perturbation is strongly reduced . in contrary , for large froude numbers , the disturbances of the free surface profile exactly match that of the bed profile in phase as well as in amplitude .",

    "the following calculation is only an illustration of the integral method .",
    "we thus restrict ourselves to exhibit the interest of the new equations in comparison to the lubrication approximation .",
    "we refer the reader interested in dunes generated by a steady viscous flow to @xcite .",
    "the linear stability analysis of a flat sand bed can be described in the framework developed by @xcite for dunes forming in a turbulent boundary layer .",
    "the evolution of the bed @xmath45 is governed by the sand mass conservation : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the volumic sediment flux , i.e. the volume of the sand grains per unit time which cross an infinite normal surface of unit transverse width .",
    "the sand flux @xmath80 itself depends on the basal shear stress @xmath81 , with a space lag @xmath82 ( @xcite ) @xmath83 where the saturated sand flux @xmath84 is a function of @xmath81 only . for the following analysis",
    ", we do not need to know the details of the transport law @xmath85 but only the value of this saturated flux over a flat bed , @xmath86 , and that of the coefficient : @xmath87 the unstable modes are now of the form @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath89 is the temporal growth rate of the dunes and @xmath90 is their phase velocity .",
    "equation ( [ exner ] ) then reads @xmath91 .",
    "similarly , equation ( [ sat ] ) simplifies into @xmath92 , where subscripts @xmath93 denote first order corrections .",
    "combining these two equations , we get @xmath94 which relates @xmath89 to the ratio @xmath95 , governed by the hydrodynamics",
    ". we can see as from now that the sand bed instability can be related to the phase of the shear stress with respect to the bed ( @xcite ) .    to determine @xmath95 , we assume that the time scales over which the bed and the flow evolve are well separated . for the hydrodynamics ,",
    "the sand bed can thus be considered as static , as in the previous section .",
    "one can compute the basal shear stress from equation ( [ uparabol ] ) with @xmath96 .",
    "its first order perturbation @xmath97 then reads : @xmath98 inserting this hydrodynamical relation into the expression of the growth rate ( [ sigma_visc ] ) , we finally obtain : @xmath99 } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the dimensionless growth rate and frequency as defined above .",

    "the growth rate is positive and the perturbation is unstable .",
    "the dashed line represents the most unstable mode .",
    "the thin line corresponds to the very same equations but without the terms coming from ( [ streamwisediffmomentum ] ) . in this case",
    ", there is no upper cut - off for @xmath73 and the most unstable mode is at @xmath103 . ]    both @xmath100 and @xmath72 are represented as a function of @xmath73 in figure [ sigmakvisc ] for different values of the froude number . for @xmath104 , the perturbation remains stable for all wavelengths ( @xmath100 is negative ) . above @xmath105 ,",
    "the perturbation is unstable for a range of @xmath73 .",
    "these lower and upper cutoffs are represented in the stability diagram of figure [ frvskvisc ] .",
    "note that the value of @xmath105 depends on the other parameters @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "unlike the growth rate , the velocity of the waves is always negative ( opposite to the fluid one ) below or above the critical froude number .",
    "as these sand dunes propagate up - stream , they correspond in fact to ` antidunes ' . performing the very same calculation without the terms coming from ( [ streamwisediffmomentum ] ) ,",
    "one get a similar scenario as that displayed in figure [ sigmakvisc ] with the important difference that when perturbations are unstable ( above @xmath108 independently of the other parameters ) , the corresponding range of wavenumbers extends up to infinitely large @xmath73 ( no upper cut - off ) . as a conclusion",
    ", the longitudinal diffusion of momentum plays a crucial role in the control of this instability .",
    "our equations are thus able to recover the correct dynamical mechanisms that were present in the original 3d equations but were lost in the shallow water approximation   and _ a fortiori _ in the lubrication approximation .",
    "in the previous section , we have shown how it is possible to extend saint - venant equations beyond the classical shallow water approximation .",
    "the method was illustrated on the extensively studied viscous case , which extends the lubrication equations to slightly inertial flows .",
    "we now apply the same method to fully turbulent flows , for which equation ( [ stvenant ] ) strongly under - estimates the rate of energy dissipation .      at large reynolds numbers fluctuations can no longer be neglected .",
    "writing the navier - stokes equation for the mean flow ( intended as an ensemble average over realizations ) , a turbulent stress @xmath109 adds to the viscous one , called the reynolds stress tensor ( @xcite ) . for large values of @xmath110 ,",
    "the viscosity term may be neglected and the saint - venant equation becomes : @xmath111 \\ , dz = \\int_z^h [ g \\sin\\theta - { \\partial_x}p + { \\partial_x}\\tau_{xx } + { \\partial_z}\\tau_{xz } ] \\ , dz.\\ ] ] in the case of a homogeneous turbulent boundary layer , @xmath112 can be related to the velocity gradient using dimensional analysis .",
    "the only length - scale is given by the distance to the boundary @xmath11 and the only time scale by the inverse of the shear rate @xmath113 .",
    "the shear stress is then of the form @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the prandtl mixing length .",
    "@xmath116 is the von krmn constant , determined experimentally , and @xmath117 is the hydrodynamic roughness . for a homogeneous shear stress @xmath118 , one obtains a logarithmic velocity profile @xmath119    in the general case",
    ", there exists no univoque relation between the reynolds stress @xmath112 and the velocity field .",
    "however , situations close to the homogeneous turbulent boundary layer can be reasonably described by a phenomenological closure . for the sake of simplicity , we have chosen here to introduce a turbulent viscosity @xmath120 , derived from the prandtl mixing length approach .",
    "the reynolds stress tensor is written as a function of the velocity gradient : @xmath121 . in the case of a river",
    ", it is commonly assumed that the pressure field is hydrostatic and that the velocity profile , as in the case of the turbulent boundary layer , is logarithmic .",
    "we thus write @xmath122 where @xmath16 is the instantaneous local flow rate defined in ( [ defq ] ) .",
    "the vertical integration of this profile @xmath123 gives for self - consistency @xmath124 this so - called chezy coefficient is an important quantity as it gives the ratio of the shear stress on the bed to the square of the mean velocity : @xmath125 ( see below ) .    in the steady case , due to the linearity of the shear stress with @xmath11 , we get the following expression for the prandtl mixing length : @xmath126 we recover , with this phenomenological expression , that the size of the mixing eddies is limited by the distance to the rigid boundary as well as by that to the free surface . by analogy with the previous viscous equations ,",
    "we introduce a turbulent viscosity @xmath120 in the definition of the shear stress tensor @xmath127 .",
    "in contrast to the viscous case where the viscosity is a constant , @xmath120 depends on @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath32 : @xmath128      we consider a 2d turbulent fluid flow down an incline . keeping the relations ( [ uturbul ] ) and ( [ pturbul ] )",

    "furthermore , under the approximation @xmath132 , the value of @xmath133 is close to unity .",
    "therefore , one recovers the standard shallow water equation : @xmath134 among the additional terms , one recognizes a term corresponding to a diffusion of momentum along @xmath10 . as in the viscous case ,",
    "the other dissipative terms originate from the geometry of the flow .      to illustrate this method in the turbulent case , we study the transverse mean velocity profile in a river homogeneous along the streamwise direction .",
    "this is a standard hydrological geometry , usually treated within the shallow water approximation ( @xcite ) .",
    "we show here that the transverse momentum fluxes plays a significant role .",
    "in other words , the predicted mean flow is sensitive to the way friction on the bed and the banks is taken into account ( @xcite ) .",
    "as previously , we call @xmath10 the direction of the flow , @xmath106 the slope of the river and @xmath11 the axis normal to the bed .",
    "@xmath12 designates the direction perpendicular to the flow .",
    "for this example , we take a simple polynomial form for the transverse depth profile @xmath135 , shown in figure [ river](a ) .",
    "such a flat and elongated shape is typically that of channels or river beds .",
    "note that the above equations have been derived for a flow over a bottom varying along the _ streamwise direction _",
    "@xmath10 in order to allow for a straightforward comparison between the three cases ( viscous , turbulent and granular flow rules ) . for the determination of the velocity profile in a river ,",
    "the bed varies along the _ direction transverse to the flow _ , @xmath12 .",
    "it thus requires a specific derivation of the integral method . as it strictly follows the same procedure , we shall mainly explicit the main steps and emphasise the differences .",

    "lengths are in units of the bed roughness @xmath137 .",
    "the velocity is rescaled by @xmath138 , and the stresses by @xmath139 .",
    "for this example , we choose @xmath140 with channel deepest depth @xmath141 and channel width @xmath142 . in panel ( b ) , the solid line corresponds to the velocity field computed taking into account the friction due to the banks .",
    "it is qualitatively different and quantitatively lower than that including the bed friction only ( dashed line ) . ]    at first sight , such a channel geometry is close to the homogeneous turbulent boundary layer .",
    "this suggests that a prandtl - like closure , although phenomenological , may be successful .",
    "however , four different distances come into play to construct a mixing length @xmath143 : the distances to the bed and to the free surface as in the previous sub - sections ( i.e. in the @xmath11 direction ) , but also the distances to the left and right banks of the river ( in the @xmath12 direction ) . for the sake of simplicity , we decouple the @xmath11 and @xmath12 contributions by writing @xmath144 in the above expression , @xmath145 is the roughness of the river banks   we shall below simply take @xmath146 as well as @xmath147 .",

    ", we can directly read that the last term is of diffusive form , with a turbulent eddy viscosity written in terms of @xmath158 and the mean velocity @xmath159 gradient . without its contribution ,",
    "i.e. without taking into account the friction of the banks , the steady solution of this equation is the usual hydrological relation ( @xcite ) @xmath160 the result of the integration of equation ( [ u_river ] ) is displayed in figure [ river](b ) with the solid line .",
    "the important point is that , although the typical bed profile curvature scales on the water depth , that of the velocity is more like the channel width .",
    "this is in agreement with experimental and field measures ( @xcite ) . for comparison",
    ", the dashed line corresponds to the velocity computed with formula ( [ uh ] ) .",
    "its profile is , by contrast , as flat as @xmath135 . finally , the stress profiles are shown in panel ( c ) . as expected",
    ", the curvature of the curve @xmath161 is similar to that of @xmath162 .",
    "more interesting is the profile @xmath163 : it goes very quickly ( almost at the bank ) to its maximum ( absolute ) value and then gently decreases down to zero at the center of the channel .",
    "this large value of @xmath136 is of the order of that of @xmath118 at the center of the channel where the flow velocity is the largest .",
    "this means that the banks are in fact as stressed as the center of the channel bed .",
    "this remark may be of importance as far as erosion processes are concerned .",
    "the integral method can be applied to the case of a dense granular material flowing down an inclined plane , just like for a fluid . as for the above turbulent flow case , the starting equations are identical to ( [ ns ] ) but the viscous term @xmath164 is replaced by @xmath165 . of course , the constitutive relation , i.e. the relation between the stress tensor to the velocity field , has to be specified . we use here the recent advances in this field obtained by @xcite .      it has been shown that the rheology of dense granular flows is local in first approximation .",
    "this means that the stress and the shear rate at a given location in the flow are related through a univoque relation . from dimensional analysis",

    "this unexpected behaviour of the curve @xmath210 could not be checked with the calculations of @xcite as , in accordance with the experimental data , the numerics was run up to @xmath228 only .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that , for the description of the dynamical properties of flows , one can go beyond the lubrication or shallow water approximations following a well - defined procedure that can be adapted to any constitutive relation : the integral method .",
    "the equations derived within this framework are simpler to integrate than the full 3d equations ( e.g. the navier - stokes equations ) but possess the same physical ingredients .",
    "the technique consists in choosing ` test functions ' for the velocity profiles , whose functional form is inferred from the exact homogeneous and steady solutions of the full equations , and in performing a depth averaging procedure with these profiles .",
    "we have successfully applied this method to situations as diverse as viscous , turbulent and granular flows down an incline . in these three cases",
    ", we have investigated a specific example , respectively , formation of anti - dunes , velocity profile in a river cross - section and development of the kapitza instability .",
    "we have emphasised the benefits of the method compared to the usual approximations . in particular",
    ", we have shown that important physical mechanisms are qualitatively recovered : the presence of wavelength or frequency cut - offs in the dispersion relations of anti - dune or kapitza instabilities , the significant role of the friction at the river banks on the velocity profile curvature .",
    "a strong assumption in the derivation proposed concerns the exchanges of vertical momentum . in the three cases",
    ", we have indeed assumed that the pressure was dominated by gravity effects .",
    "it has for instance been shown by @xcite that the topography induces corrections to the hydrostatics pressure profile .",
    "it has also been shown by @xcite that , in the first stages of the vertical collapse of a granular column , gravity is not balanced by the pressure but by the vertical acceleration .",
    "the description of such a situation is beyond the scope of the equations derived here .",
    "however , the same strategy could be applied , using the depth - averaged vertical momentum equation to determine the pressure , whose profile would be prescribed by a test - function . by analogy to the choice made for the velocity , a linear pressure profile is probably the best choice as one recovers the above equations when vertical inertia and vertical diffusion of momentum are negligible .",
    "a dedicated work is needed to test this idea further on .",
    "our aim is now to use the integral method as a tool to investigate physical problems such as the formation of current ripples versus dunes in viscous or turbulent flumes , the river width selection or the description of fingering effects in granular avalanches .",
