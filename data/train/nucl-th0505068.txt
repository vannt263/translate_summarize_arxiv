    "in a previous work @xcite we introduced a covariant impulse approximation method for the study of scattering processes on composite systems .",
    "we briefly recall that in the impulse approximation one constituent interacts with the external field , while the others , the spectators , do not change their momenta in the interaction process . in the present paper",
    "we derive , by means of a gauge invariant procedure , the specific form of the electromagnetic current operator for a system made up by two scalars constituents .",
    "+ after discussing some general properties of the obtained current operator , we study a numerical application to reproduce the experimental behavior of the pion form factor , being aware that in the present simplified `` scalar '' model all the spin effects are neglected . also , we verify that the approximations of the procedure as such do not allow to reproduce the form factor at low momentum transfer . to remedy to this failure we introduce a suitable vector meson dominance ( vmd ) corrective factor , consistently with the other assumptions of the model .",
    "this vmd factor takes into account , in a phenomenological way , all our `` ignorance '' about the structure of the bound state explored at low momentum transfer .",
    "+ we point out that the main aim of the present work is to analyze in a clear way our procedure for deriving a conserved current with the simplest dynamical model , that is two scalar interacting constituents . + the same procedure , applied to the much more complex case represented by the nucleon as a three - quark relativistic composite system , is currently under examination and gives very good results for the study of the electric and magnetic nucleon form factors @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in a subsequent work we shall study the pion form factor by considering a model with two spin @xmath0 -quark antiquark- particles . + the present work is organized as follows : in section 2 , we analyze the dynamical relativistic model and extract from the wave equation the conserved current . finally in section 3",
    "we introduce the vmd factor and draw some conclusions .",
    "we firstly introduce the relativistic wave - equation for the two - body system . in its rest frame ( rf )",
    "it has the standard form of a positive energy relativistic integral equation @xcite @xmath1\\varphi(\\vec p ) = \\int d^3p ' w(\\vec p,\\vec{p'})\\varphi(\\vec{p'}),\\ ] ] where @xmath2 represents the relative momentum of the constituents ; hereafter , the asterisk denotes the quantities referred to the rf ; @xmath3 represents the kinetic energy of the constituents , being @xmath4 their mass ; finally , @xmath5 denotes the interaction operator .",
    "+ in a generic reference frame that is chosen for the observation of the scattering process , called observation reference frame ( orf ) , the 4-momenta , on - shell , of the two constituents @xmath6 , @xmath7 , are obtained with a lorentz transformation on the corresponding quantities of the rf .",
    "standard calculations give the following relation : @xmath8 where @xmath9 in the previous equations the total observable 4-momentum of the system @xmath10 is introduced with @xmath11 . equation ( [ 2.4 ] ) represents the main assumption of the present model that is based on the use of on - shell momenta as dynamical spatial variables .",
    "+ also , by means of the last two equations it is easily shown that in an orf , the on - shell 4-momentum @xmath7 can be considered as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath10 . in consequence",
    "we can make for the explicitly covariant wave - equation in an orf the following hypothesis : @xmath12f\\varphi = \\int \\frac{d^3p'_1}{e(p'_1 ) } v(p_1,p'_1,p)f'\\varphi',\\ ] ] being @xmath13 an function : @xmath14 . calculating the previous equation in the rf , the requirement of hermiticity of the interaction leads to @xmath15 and , comparing with equation ( [ 2.1 ] )",
    ", one finds that the interaction of the orf equation is related to that of the rf by the following relation : @xmath16 also @xmath17 the last equation shows that the rest frame momentum must be expressed as a function of the orf momentum @xmath6 and of the total 4-momentum @xmath10 by means of a standard lorentz transformation .",
    "+ starting from the covariant wave equation in the orf of equation ( [ 2.6 ] ) , we derive the gauge invariant conserved current by means of the following procedure .    1 .",
    "we specialize equation ( [ 2.6 ] ) to the initial state , that is @xmath18 .",
    "2 .   to obtain the current related to the constituent 2 , being the constituent 1 the spectator , one should multiply by its charge , @xmath19 . however , in the example under examination , due to the symmetries of the wave function , to derive the total current one can directly multiply by the total charge of the system , denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "we multiply by @xmath21 and perform the covariant integration over @xmath22 .",
    "we repeat this procedure for the h.c .",
    "wave function of the final state .",
    "subtracting the two results we obtain @xmath23 - 2\\delta\\left[\\frac{p^{\\nu}}{m}\\right ] p_{1\\nu}\\right]f(p_1,p_i)\\varphi(p_1,p_i){\\nonumber}\\\\ { \\nonumber}\\\\ & = q\\int \\frac{d^3p_1}{e(p_1)}\\frac{d^3p'_1}{e(p'_1 ) } \\varphi^+(p_f , p_1)f(p_f , p_1)\\delta[v(p_1,p'_1,p)]f(p_i , p_1)\\varphi(p_i , p_1),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the notation @xmath24=o(p_f)-o(p_i)\\ ] ] has been introduced .",
    "in particular , we point out that in all the @xmath25 quantities in equation ( [ 2.10 ] ) the momentum transfer @xmath26 can be factorized .",
    "we have @xmath27 = q_{\\mu}\\frac{2k^{\\mu}}{m_f+m_i},\\ ] ] @xmath28 = q_{\\mu } \\left[\\frac12\\frac{m_f+m_i}{m_fm_i}g^{\\mu\\nu } - \\frac{2k^{\\mu}k^{\\nu}}{m_fm_i(m_f+m_i)}\\right],\\ ] ] with @xmath29 also , @xmath30 $ ] can be expressed in a similar way as it will be shown in a subsequent work .",
    "we obtain a current @xmath31 that satisfies the gauge condition @xmath32 in this paper we study the terms obtained from the lhs of equation ( [ 2.10 ] ) that represent the `` kinetic '' contributions .",
    "we have : @xmath33f(p_i , p_1)\\varphi(p_i , p_1),{\\nonumber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the matrix - element of the current of the last equation is of the same kind of that introduced in our previous work -see equation ( 3.8 ) of @xcite- .",
    "in other words , the contribution to the current coming from the kinetic energy of the covariant wave equation gives rise to a term of impulse approximation form , where the spectator s 4-momentum @xmath6 remains unchanged .",
    "the operator of the interacting particle that is represented in the present work by the term in the parenthesis of equation ( [ 2.16 ] ) , was generically denoted as @xmath34 in equation ( 3.8 ) of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , standard but tedious calculations show that , in the present model , this operator , in the limit of free constituents , is proportional to @xmath35 as it must be for scalar particles .",
    "finally , the factors @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 represent the covariant normalization factors of the wave function , also introduced in @xcite .",
    "+ in the following we study the case of elastic scattering , that is , @xmath39 ; the elastic form factor is related to the matrix - elements of the current by the following equation : @xmath40 that will be used to determine @xmath41 . + for the calculations the breit reference frame will be used . in this frame",
    ", one has @xmath42^{1/2},\\pm\\frac{\\vec q}{2}\\right)\\label{2.18 } \\\\ q & = ( 0,\\vec q)\\label{2.19 } \\\\ k & = \\left(\\left[m^2+\\frac{q^2}{4}\\right]^{1/2},\\vec 0\\right).\\label{2.20}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] also , the momentum transfer @xmath43 is taken along the @xmath44 axis .",
    "in consequence , for an elastic scattering , in the breit frame , the matrix elements of the current take the form @xmath45 where , from equation ( [ 2.16 ] ) , @xmath46 has the form @xmath47,\\ ] ] @xmath48 note that , even though equation ( [ 2.16 ] ) only represents the kinetic contribution to the current , this current is conserved , in elastic scattering on a scalar composite system .",
    "this property can be proved by means of invariance under parity transformations .",
    "+ to this aim let us consider the operator @xmath49 , which is the only one appearing in the current conservation relations .",
    "it satisfies the following relation under parity transformation : @xmath50 furthermore , in this case , that is , elastic scattering on a scalar state in the breit frame , the parity transformation interchanges the initial and final states : @xmath51 the last two equations are sufficient to prove current conservation , that , due to the covariance of the model , holds in all the reference frames .",
    "+   + considering the numerical results for the form factor , we found that with standard wave - functions as gaussian , hulten , or the modified hulten that will be introduced later , this simple scalar model reproduces the high momentum transfer behavior of the pion form factor , while the low momentum transfer region can not be correctly reproduced .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "this problem can be related to the highly non perturbative character of the system when explored at low momentum transfer , i.e. at large spatial distance .",
    "+ on the other hand , the model , being essentially a relativistic impulse approximation , explains correctly the `` partonic '' behavior at high momentum transfer , i.e. at short spatial distance .",
    "+ a phenomenological way to improve the model is to introduce the so called vector meson dominance , as it will be explained in the next section .",
    "the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) is an old model that has been extensively used for the study of the electro - weak interactions of hadronic systems . as for the electron scattering processes ,",
    "the initial photon interacts not only in a direct way with the hadronic system , but also by means of an intermediate meson ( @xmath52 ) having the same ( vector ) quantum numbers as the photon . in consequence the bare electromagnetic vertex",
    "is multiplied by the following factor @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 represent the mass and the 4-momentum transfer squared of the virtual vector meson , respectively .",
    "also , @xmath56 represents the `` intensity '' of the vector meson coupling . in the last term of the previous equation",
    "we recognize straightforwardly the vector meson propagator .",
    "the expression of @xmath57 in ( [ 3.1 ] ) is constructed in such way that , when the momentum transfer is vanishing , the charge normalization of the electromagnetic current is not affected , being @xmath58 .",
    "+ for the present example , unessential isospin operators are neglected .",
    "+ in standard vmd models , a monopole form @xmath59 is considered and @xmath55 is taken of the same magnitude as the virtual photon momentum transfer , that is @xmath60 on the other hand , in the present work we assume that the state of the vector meson is determined by the dynamics of the hadronic constituent to which the vector meson is coupled , that is the # 2 .",
    "for this reason we take @xmath61 that is the difference squared of the on shell momenta of the interacting constituent in the initial and final state ; their explicit expression is obtained by means of equations ( [ 2.4 ] ) and ( [ 2.5 ] ) .",
    "the same implementation of the vmd has been used to study the weak current of the nucleon in a relativistic quark model @xcite .",
    "+ multiplying @xmath62 by @xmath57 with the assumption of equation ( [ 3.3 ] ) and performing the integration , we obtain the final result of the model .",
    "+ for the wave function we have taken a modified hulten function given by the following expression @xmath63 the values of the parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 being @xmath66 the normalization constant , are chosen to reproduce the pion form factor and are given in the figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "+   + in conclusion , this very simple scalar model has been used to study some good properties of the covariant impulse approximation introduced in @xcite . with the same model we tried to reproduce the pion form factor also introducing the effects of the vmd consistently with the other assumptions of the model ."
