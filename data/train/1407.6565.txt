    "simulations of structure formation in the universe with dark matter only lead us to believe that virialized structures , such as dark matter haloes , possess universal properties that depend only weakly on mass .",
    "one such property , most often used , is the spherically averaged density profile that can be approximated by the well - known nfw @xcite formula .",
    "however , dark matter haloes are definitely not spherical and their shapes can be approximated by triaxial ellipsoids , with principal axes labelled @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , so that @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite reported that on average @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , the longest axis is usually aligned with the closest filament in the neighbouring structure .",
    "@xcite showed that the profiles of axis ratios are increasing functions of radius , i.e. their outer parts are more spherical than the inner ones .",
    "the inner regions are usually elongated , whereas the outer ones are triaxial or even oblate .",
    "another quantity often used to describe the properties of dark matter haloes is the anisotropy parameter @xmath7 @xcite that characterizes the type of orbits dominating in the halo . in general , this parameter is also found to be a function of radius and may depend on mass and environment .",
    "for example , @xcite found that the inner parts of simulated cluster - size haloes are characterized by @xmath8 while the outer parts are usually radially biased with @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is the virial radius ) .",
    "although the nearly zero value of the anisotropy parameter in the central parts of simulated haloes is commonly interpreted as a signature of an isotropic velocity distribution , it results from spherical averaging of an axisymmetric and highly anisotropic velocity distribution @xcite .",
    "the origin of these properties and the relation between the density distribution , shape and orbital properties of dark matter haloes is still under investigation .",
    "one phenomenon that may contribute to the evolution of these properties is the one of orbit instability . @xcite",
    "proved that a system consisting entirely of matter streams moving radially is unstable against perturbations of potential .",
    "independently , @xcite showed that a system with a radially anisotropic distribution function is unstable .",
    "the existence of this kind of instability in an @xmath0-body simulation was demonstrated for the first time by @xcite .",
    "he showed that the shape of an initially spherical system , whose particles have only radial component of velocity ( i.e. @xmath11 ) , changes dramatically in the course of the simulation .",
    "this type of instability is referred to as the radial orbit instability ( roi ) .",
    "@xcite analyzed a finite - size system , whose @xmath12 profile rose from zero in the centre to a given value at the boundary of the system .",
    "they decomposed the density and potential into a complete set of functions with the angular part described by spherical harmonics @xmath13 and searched for exponentially growing eigenmodes .",
    "the system turned out to be unstable to the @xmath14 mode .",
    "moreover , they identified a boundary that separates a system vulnerable to roi .",
    "they introduced a global parameter @xmath15 , which for a system without streaming motions of particles amounts to @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a global anisotropy parameter .",
    "the system studied by @xcite turned out to be stable for @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite analyzed a suite of systems that all had the same density profile but various @xmath12 profiles .",
    "they used two families of models : one with @xmath20 const and one with the osipkov - merritt @xcite anisotropy profile : @xmath21 $ ] , where @xmath22 is the so - called anisotropy radius . for constant @xmath23",
    "they found that roi sets on for @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) . in the case of the second family transition",
    "was found for @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the half - mass radius .",
    "for such a model @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "therefore , a global value of @xmath30 is not a good indicator of the possibility of the onset of roi .",
    "@xcite additionally found that the density profile averaged in spherical shells does not change significantly due to roi , although the final elongations were @xmath31 .",
    "most of their models were axisymmetric , only the one composed only of radial orbits was triaxial , with @xmath32 .",
    "the stability of anisotropic spherical systems against roi was later investigated also by means of the adiabatic deformation method @xcite , @xmath0-body simulations @xcite and the linear stability analysis @xcite .",
    "roi may be connected to the form of the density profiles of cosmological haloes .",
    "@xcite showed that for a cold collapse occurring in cosmological setting , if tangential components of gravity were artificially turned off , a halo with the density profile @xmath33 would form , in contrast with normal conditions when a halo with an nfw profile forms . in similar simulations @xcite noted that the haloes formed were elongated , with @xmath12 raising from zero in the centre to unity at the virial radius .",
    "one more factor that affects the final shape of the haloes formed from a collapse is the initial virial ratio ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite indicated that an initially isotropic core suppresses the onset of roi during cold collapse .",
    "an additional stabilizing factor is the presence of a black hole in the centre of the system .",
    "it may entirely suppress instability @xcite or even drive partial reduction of elongation @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a counterpart of roi in a system that was already triaxial .",
    "initially , their system had axis ratios @xmath34 and @xmath35 . during the simulation ,",
    "the shape has changed to less triaxial and finally @xmath36 . moreover ,",
    "reduction of the number of box orbits led to the suppression of instability .",
    "understanding roi may be crucial for at least two reasons .",
    "first , it allows us to place constraints on dynamical models constructed to describe real galaxies .",
    "second , it seems that the onset of roi may be of importance in the process of the formation of dark matter haloes , which surround individual galaxies and whole clusters . in this work",
    "we study the impact of roi on systems having initially the same nfw density profile , but different anisotropy profiles .",
    "our study is inspired by recent developments in the understanding of anisotropy profiles of gravitationally bound systems forming in cosmological context .",
    "we focus on dark matter haloes of mass and other properties characteristic of present - day dwarf galaxies .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that the dynamical time of the systems is relatively short and therefore their evolution may be significant over cosmic time .",
    "such systems are presumably old , therefore there was likely enough time for roi to affect them .",
    "formation of non - spherical dwarf haloes is also important for testing the reliability of different methods of estimating mass and density profiles of these haloes as such models can be used to generate mock data samples .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_simulations ]",
    "we describe the initial conditions used in our simulations and the set - up of the @xmath0-body code . in section [ sec_mass_distribution ]",
    "we show how the distribution of matter in the haloes changes due to the occurrence of roi depending of the different anisotropy profiles assumed . in section [ sec_kinematics ]",
    "we characterize the influence of roi on halo kinematics , while in section [ sec_individual_orbits ] we focus on orbits of individual particles .",
    "the discussion follows in section [ sec_discussion ] and in section [ sec_summary ] we summarize our results .",
    "the initial conditions of our simulations were generated as numerical realizations of dark matter haloes with the same nfw profile and different profiles of the orbital anisotropy . since the standard nfw profile does not have a finite mass , as the radial density profile we adopted the nfw profile with a cut - off at the virial radius @xmath37 : @xmath38 thus , below the virial radius our haloes have the standard nfw density distribution with the characteristic density @xmath39 and the scale radius @xmath40 . outside the virial radius",
    "the density profile is steeper and the constants @xmath0 and @xmath41 are determined by the condition that the functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 are continuous near @xmath10 .",
    "we employed haloes with the virial mass ( the mass inside the virial radius ) @xmath44 , the virial radius @xmath45 kpc and the concentration parameter @xmath46 , resulting in a scale radius @xmath47 kpc .",
    "although these choices make the results directly applicable to galaxies of the dwarf mass scale , they can be rescaled to more massive objects .",
    "the appropriate scaling formulae for the nfw density profile are given in section 2.1 of @xcite .",
    "we adopted a model of the distribution function proposed by @xcite , namely @xmath48 with its angular momentum part given by the formula @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are anisotropies of the system in the centre and at infinity , respectively .",
    "the angular momentum constant @xmath52 is related to the characteristic radius @xmath53 defined as @xmath54 that describes the scale of transition from @xmath50 to @xmath51 in the @xmath12 profile .",
    "such a profile of anisotropy has three free parameters and is sufficiently flexible to adequately describe the variability and diversity of @xmath12 profiles found in majority of cosmological haloes .",
    "it is also possible to choose a set of values @xmath55 that corresponds to a mean anisotropy profile of a halo @xcite .",
    "the assumed density profile uniquely determines the energy part of the distribution function , @xmath56 .",
    "the details of its construction are given in @xcite .",
    "we generated seven different numerical realizations of dark matter haloes with different initial orbital anisotropy @xmath23 profiles .",
    "the basic properties of the models are listed in table [ tab_models ] .",
    "the first three models in the table , c1-c3 , had constant anisotropy parameters : @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively . in the other four",
    "the anisotropy varied with radius .",
    "the peculiar model d had an anisotropy profile decreasing with radius from @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "the central anisotropy parameter in this model ( and model c3 ) takes the maximum value permitted by the condition of non - negative phase - space density for a spherical nfw halo ( see @xcite ) .",
    "models i1-i3 had the anisotropy profile increasing with radius , with the same central and asymptotic anisotropy , namely @xmath62 , @xmath63 , but the value of the transition radius @xmath53 was varied from 0.5 to 2 times the scale radius @xmath40 .",
    "such a dependence on radius was chosen in order to mimic the anisotropy profiles obtained in cosmological simulations ( see e.g @xcite ) .",
    "the last column of table [ tab_models ] gives the colour with which the results for a given orbit will be shown throughout the paper .",
    "all the anisotropy profiles considered here are plotted in figure  [ fig_initialanisotropy ] .",
    ".anisotropy models of simulated haloes . [ cols=\"^,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in an integrable potential in order to classify an orbit it is sufficient to know its integrals of motion , as orbit families occupy distinct regions in the space of integrals of motion . in the simulation we do not know the exact form of the potential , moreover it evolves in time , thus it is impossible to determine integrals of motion and place any definite conditions on the membership of an orbit in a given family",
    ". there exists an efficient method for searching for basic frequencies ( e.g. @xcite ) , but it could not be used for our simulations , as it requires a much denser sampling of particle positions and velocities . here",
    ", we adopt instead the approach of @xcite who described simple criteria that allow to determine the orbit type for a given particle .",
    "we modified them slightly and present them in table [ tab_orbit_conditions ] .",
    "as in the previous section , the coordinate system is such that the @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 axis are oriented along , respectively , the major , intermediate and minor axis of the matter distribution . for the b family",
    "it is crucial for all of the mean components of the angular momentum @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 to vanish .",
    "in addition , this kind of orbit is symmetric with respect to the principal planes of the coordinate system .",
    "this means that the largest distances from both sides of the @xmath70 plane , i.e. in the positive direction of @xmath64 axis ( @xmath71 ) and negative ( @xmath72 ) , are the same ( except for the sign ) : @xmath73 .",
    "a similar condition holds for the outermost positions in the @xmath65 and @xmath66 direction .",
    "the simple resonant orbits from the family r also have negligible @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , but they are asymmetric with respect to at least one plane of the coordinate system .",
    "the three remaining families have a fixed sense of rotation and , consequently , one component of the angular momentum does not change its sign , thus its average is non - vanishing . for the family",
    "s the non - alternating angular momentum component is @xmath74 .",
    "the distinction between the two families of orbits rotating around the @xmath64-axis ( both of which have @xmath75 const ) is given by a simple feature , which can be easily seen in the relevant figures of @xcite : the i orbits are _ concave _ , while the o orbits are _ convex _ with respect to the @xmath64 axis ( i.e. their axis of revolution ) . quantifying this feature results in that for family i the maximum distance from the @xmath64-axis ( @xmath76 ) and the minimum one ( @xmath77 ) occur , respectively , at a large and a small distance from the @xmath70 plane .",
    "simply put , @xmath78 .",
    "the situation is reversed for the family o.    for the analysis of orbits we again chose simulation c3 because it underwent the most pronounced evolution , thus we expect the largest differences between orbit types .",
    "we have analyzed orbits of all particles with initial energy in the range @xmath79 ( km s@xmath80)@xmath81 .",
    "there were about 1200 such particles .",
    "in the nfw potential the circular orbit of such energy has the radius of about 1.95 kpc and the period of 0.67 gyr .",
    "its angular momentum , and thus the maximum angular momentum for such energy , amounts to @xmath82 kpc km s@xmath80 . at this distance from the centre",
    ", the shape ceases to change at about 2.5 gyr from the beginning of the simulation , so the adopted conditions from table [ tab_orbit_conditions ] apply to a later time .",
    "such a choice of the energy is a compromise between two extremes .",
    "particles further away from the centre of the halo completed too few cycles to reliably determine the families they belong to . on the other hand ,",
    "particles from the more central part of the halo have short periods and with positions saved only every @xmath83 gyr we could not fully trace their motion .",
    "+   +   +     in figure  [ fig_orbit_projections ] we show a few examples of particle orbits in projection onto the principal planes of the coordinate system . in most cases the change of the orbit after @xmath84 gyr is easily seen .",
    "apart from stability , a system made up only of o - type particles would be axisymmetric and oblate ( but then we would call this family s ) . in the case of family",
    "i , it would be prolate and , in an extreme case , slightly triaxial . the contribution from the box orbits",
    "also makes the system elongated , but much more triaxial .",
    "it is worth noting that the extreme position in the @xmath64-direction of a b - type particle is larger than in the case of a particle belonging to family i. it is a result of an i - type particle having a non - zero velocity at a maximum distance ( to conserve @xmath85const@xmath86 ) , whereas a b - particle stops at this point , thus it can move away more while conserving its energy . in the cases of both families",
    "i and b , a particle spends more time at a greater distance from the @xmath87-plane than in its vicinity .",
    "the situation is similar to that in a keplerian potential when it spends more time away from the centre of the potential .    , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are along the major , intermediate and minor axis of the halo . ]    in figure  [ fig_particle_angular_momentum ] we show the time dependence of the modulus of the angular momentum and its components for the same particles that were used in figure  [ fig_orbit_projections ] .",
    "for the family i , the @xmath88 component is approximately conserved , but the other two oscillate in time . in consequence ,",
    "the angular momentum modulus also oscillates and is usually larger than its initial value .",
    "the variation of the angular momentum of the o - type particles is similar . in the case of the s - type orbit ,",
    "the sign of the @xmath74 component is conserved and the other two oscillate . for the box and resonant orbits",
    "all three components oscillate with large amplitudes and their mean values are zero . in effect , the mean angular momentum modulus is larger than at the beginning .",
    "the energy of each single particle is approximately constant , however non - periodic changes are present .",
    "this is related to the time - dependence of the potential due to the evolution of the halo shape , hence the energy is not an integral of motion .",
    "one can raise the question whether we can predict which family a given particle will join based on its initial position and velocity vectors .",
    "if the families differ between themselves in angular momentum , then such classification will likely depend on the initial angular momentum vector .     and @xmath89 .",
    "_ bottom panel _ : orbit classification for particles which originally had @xmath90 , depending on the initial @xmath91 and @xmath74 . ]    in the top panel of figure  [ fig_orbit_classification ] we show to which family a particle belongs , depending on its initial @xmath88 and @xmath92 , i.e. the projection of the angular momentum vector onto the @xmath70 plane .",
    "first , let us consider the region @xmath93 .",
    "clearly , the families i and o occupy distinct regions",
    ". for small @xmath88 particles belong to family o above @xmath94 . for large @xmath88",
    "this value raises up to @xmath95 or maybe even more .",
    "interestingly , i orbits with initial @xmath96 are actually oblate  their maximum distance from the @xmath70 plane is smaller than the maximum distance from the @xmath97 axis .",
    "hence all particles with @xmath98 appear to eventually move on an orbit with an oblate shape .",
    "particles from the family o residing in the uniform i region are erroneously interpreted resonances .",
    "we also note that not all the particles which were marked by our algorithm as belonging to the family i indeed belong to it , they just have similar shape .",
    "it is due to the fact that our orbit classification is very simple and based on very crude properties of the angular momentum time dependence and the shape of the orbit of the particle .",
    "it is not precise enough to grasp the whole variety of resonant and chaotic orbits .    in order to examine the region @xmath99 , in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig_orbit_classification ]",
    "we plot all particles fulfilling this condition , in the plane of the initial @xmath91 versus @xmath74 . for @xmath100",
    "two families are present : s for @xmath101 and o in the opposite case . for small values of @xmath102",
    "there is no clear division between orbits from families i , b and r. the orbits b and r seem to disappear for @xmath103 . in the case of family i the larger the ratio @xmath104 ( above unity ) , the smaller the fraction of particles with this type of orbit among all .",
    "a closer inspection reveals that they usually then have larger @xmath88 .    in a spherically symmetric nfw potential , the region which the particle is allowed to occupy",
    "is uniquely determined by the energy and the angular momentum vector .",
    "it has to be noted that the final orbit type does not seem to be always determined by the components of the angular momentum , but may also depend on other factors , such as the particle trajectory when the shape evolution occurs .",
    ", for all simulations .",
    "the vertical dotted line indicates the radius beyond which the evolution of model c3 is not yet completed .",
    "the evolution of model i1 has not finished anywhere . ]",
    "all final states of the haloes can be considered biaxial , thus in figure  [ fig_comparision_axes_ratios ] we plot the final short - to - long axis ratios for all models , with the ratio defined as @xmath105 .",
    "one should notice different areas affected by the instability .",
    "the haloes in simulations c1 , i2 and i3 have not undergone roi . in these cases",
    "the axis ratios at all radii are consistent with unity within uncertainties from shot noise .",
    "first , let us consider models whose initial profile of the anisotropy parameter was constant , i.e. @xmath20const . systems with an isotropic distribution of orbits ( @xmath106 ) , such as model c1 , are stable and roi does not develop in them .",
    "the more radial the orbits , i.e. the larger is the initial @xmath23 parameter , the greater is the impact of roi on the shape of the halo .",
    "the moment when the configuration of the particles begins to change depends to some extent on the initial anisotropy , whereas the rate of this change depends significantly on @xmath23 . after some time ,",
    "when the new orbits of particles become stable , the halo reaches its final , approximately axisymmetric shape , with the axis ratios increasing with radius .    if we introduce the triaxiality parameter @xmath107 we can quantify the degree of triaxiality in the haloes .",
    "the haloes in simulations c2 and c3 have @xmath108 in the region subject to instability , hence we can conclude they are biaxial and prolate .",
    "it may seem that they are more triaxial in the centres , but the determination of the axis ratio in the central part of the halo is uncertain .",
    "additionally , haloes with a larger initial anisotropy are slightly more triaxial . in both haloes ,",
    "at the end of the simulation @xmath109 , however only in the very central part of the halo the distribution of orbits is more isotropic than initially .",
    "there exists a vast region where @xmath23 is almost equal to its initial value , though the shape of the matter distribution has altered significantly .",
    "the models c3 and d had the initial central anisotropy @xmath60 , but for the latter @xmath12 was a decreasing function of radius , approaching the isotropic distribution at large radii . comparing these simulations",
    "we conclude that for model d the rate of the evolution was considerably slower and affected a smaller part of the halo .",
    "the more isotropic distribution of orbits in the outer part of the halo suppressed the development of the instability : the radius beyond which the halo remained spherical ( @xmath110 kpc ) corresponds to the radius at which the orbits are practically isotropic ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "the central axis ratio in simulation d amounts to about 0.4 and in simulation c3 to a little more than @xmath112 .",
    "taking into account that for the nfw profile the maximum @xmath60 ( and that even using an increasing profile of @xmath12 with @xmath113 would probably not change the situation much compared to model c3 ) , we can formulate a hypothesis that the minimum central axis ratio that can occur in an nfw halo as a result of roi is about 0.3 .",
    "interestingly , it is consistent with the maximum elongation of elliptical galaxies , which are similar to dark matter haloes in a sense of being supported by random motion of their constituents . in the case of elliptical galaxies",
    "it is argued that the bending instability prevents the formation of more elongated shapes @xcite .",
    "it is thus plausible that the occurrence of this instability halts the development of roi .    among haloes which initially had an isotropic distribution of orbits in the centres and anisotropic in the outer parts ,",
    "only model i1 underwent roi .",
    "the remaining two models were stable during the 10 gyr of the simulation .",
    "we can not rule out that extending the simulation to a longer period would lead to the occurrence of the instability .",
    "then the situation would be similar to the case studied by @xcite who showed that one of the models claimed by @xcite to be stable turns out to be unstable after doubling the simulation time .",
    "@xcite argued that for generalized polytropes with a distribution function of the form @xmath114 if @xmath115 then a growing eigenmode is always present , but the growth rate @xmath116 decreases exponentially with @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath117 .",
    "hence , in the case of a finite simulation time a given system may seem stable . in our simulations ,",
    "model i1 appeared stable for a long time before the onset of the instability , so models i2 and i3 might have turned out to be unstable as well if only the simulation had lasted longer .",
    "however , there is a major difference between systems with a distribution function whose angular momentum part is given by equation with @xmath62 and generalized polytropes .",
    "in the latter case the limit @xmath118 of @xmath119 is not bounded , and according to @xcite and @xcite it is a sufficient condition for roi to occur .    in models with @xmath120",
    "the instability took place first in the very centres of the haloes and then spread outwards . in this respect ,",
    "model i1 was significantly different in a sense that in this case the roi manifested itself first at a considerable distance from the halo centre .",
    "a closer inspection revealed that the central part of this halo was not subject to instability , despite the fact that the axis ratios differed from unity .",
    "the principal axes of the shape tensor in the central part are not aligned with the principal axes in the outer part . moreover",
    ", the value of @xmath23 in the centre began to decrease only after the decrease in the outer part took place .",
    "a similar effect should be present in the case of the instability occurring in osipkov - merritt models .",
    "unfortunately , the radial dependence of axis ratios was rarely examined in the literature . in the case of @xcite work , the central parts reached @xmath121 , whereas at the radius encompassing 60 per cent of the system mass @xmath122 .",
    "@xcite studied the cold collapse of haloes in cosmological setting and for a system with a large isotropic velocity dispersion obtained a spherical nucleus .",
    "however , they did not point out that at an average distance from the halo centre @xmath123 .",
    "since the outer part of their halo remained spherical , their @xmath124 profile was qualitatively similar to the one obtained in our simulation  i1 .",
    "the values of @xmath125 , above which the system is unstable against roi , reported in the literature depend on the model and are widely scattered in the interval @xmath126 , which translates to @xmath127 ( see a review by @xcite ) . among our models which underwent roi the one with the smallest",
    "@xmath30 is model d , from which we can derive an upper limit for the critical value @xmath128 for the nfw density profile .",
    "interestingly , models i2 ( @xmath129 ) and i3 ( @xmath130 ) with a higher value of parameter @xmath131 seemed to be stable .",
    "@xcite suggested that a parameter @xmath132 , which is defined in the same way as @xmath131 , but calculated only within the half - mass radius , might be a good indicator of the stability .",
    "however , our system d had @xmath133 and was unstable .",
    "we note that this value of @xmath134 should not be treated as a new and reliable constraint on the occurrence of roi .    moreover , from figure  [ fig_comparision_axes_ratios ] it is obvious that the area subject to roi is smaller if the initial distribution of orbits is more isotropic .",
    "it seems that there might exist a critical profile @xmath135 ( or , similarly , @xmath136 ) , below which we can not confirm the occurrence of roi , because the @xmath124 and @xmath137 profiles would be indistinguishable from numerical noise ( also present in the profiles for simulation c1 ) .",
    "it would not mean that we have found a true critical value ( or profile ) of anisotropy , but only that we reached the limit of the resolution of the numerical results .",
    "additionally , @xcite showed that all systems with a distribution function not bounded in the limit of @xmath118 are unstable to roi .",
    "such a feature is for example characteristic of _ all _ distribution functions of the form given in equation , for which @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , we recommend against using the notion of the global ( or half - mass ) critical value of @xmath131 , as the onset of roi seems to depend predominantly on the shape of the anisotropy parameter profile @xmath12 .",
    "final axis ratios obtained in our simulations are similar to those reported by other authors .",
    "however , one has to bear in mind that a direct comparison of the final axis ratios is difficult , as we measured _ profiles _ of those ratios , whereas usually only global values are provided .",
    "the maximum elongation found by other authors is of the order of @xmath139 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite describe all their haloes as having @xmath140 .",
    "haloes which form as a result of cold collapse usually have @xmath141 .",
    "dark matter haloes from cosmological simulations are typically less elongated and have smaller differences between the inner and outer values of @xmath124 .",
    "we suppose that a gradual formation of such a halo , in contrast with the monolithic collapse , may be one of the reasons for the difference .",
    "the density profile of our simulated haloes did not change significantly , thus particles did not change their mean distance form the potential centre , but only reconfigured themselves .",
    "the decrease of the logarithmic slope @xmath116 in the centre may be a continuation of the effect noticed by @xcite , i.e. the transition from @xmath142 to @xmath143 in the centre of the collapsed halo if the onset of roi was permitted .",
    "the anisotropy parameter @xmath23 calculated in spherical shells is definitely an inadequate quantity to describe the velocity distribution of a non - spherical object .",
    "the fact that the orbit distribution is tangentially biased in the plane perpendicular to the major axis of the halo is connected to the prevalence of orbits with significant angular momentum ( o , s and i with high initial @xmath144 ) in this region .",
    "moreover , when members of the families b , r and the rest of the family i cross this plane , they usually have small radial and large tangential components of the velocity . on the other hand , in the region along the major axis",
    "there is much more diversity in the behaviour of the particles , thus the @xmath23 parameter remains almost the same as initially .",
    "altogether , it is likely that such a complicated distribution of orbits is not a result of roi but rather an effect of bi- or triaxiality of the potential generated by the mass distribution .",
    "a number of authors ( e.g. @xcite ) speculated about the relation between the box orbits and roi .",
    "@xcite studied the influence of the @xmath14 perturbation on two - dimensional orbits .",
    "they argued that during precession the orbit with a small generalized momentum @xmath145 ( which is in fact the angular momentum ) would be attracted by the bar and if the initial @xmath145 was small enough , the orbit would be caught by the bar . as a result , it would become a two - dimensional equivalent of a box orbit and its @xmath145 would oscillate .",
    "we have observed such oscillations for all components of the angular momentum of box orbits and for components @xmath91 and @xmath74 of inner long - axis tubes .",
    "analyzing the behaviour of individual particles one can try to understand the development of the instability . if the alignment of particles in the central part of the halo breaks spherical symmetry , particles in outer part of the halo start to move in a triaxial potential .",
    "particles with a small @xmath146 which are situated there start to move on orbits belonging to families b and i. contribution of these families to the potential is again non - spherical .",
    "therefore , particles from further away once again orbit in a triaxial potential and their trajectories are modified .",
    "such a reasoning explains the difference between models c2 and c3 . in the former case",
    "there was a smaller number of particles with a small @xmath146 , thus less particles that could have a non - spherical contribution to the density distribution .",
    "it explains also why for simulation d the outer part of the halo remained spherical .",
    "some of the particles situated there passed to family o and the rest to the others .",
    "however , there were enough particles in family o ( which initially had a large @xmath146 ) to balance the influence of families i and b.    there is no good answer to the question why in the case of models with constant @xmath23 ( c2 and c3 ) the shells lying further from the centre of the potential are rounder than the ones lying closer to the halo centre .",
    "it might be related to the bending instability , whose influence depends on the radius in a non - trivial manner .",
    "the size of the area influenced by roi may depend not on _ relative _ parameters , e.g. the ratio of the pericentre distance to the size of the orbit or the ratio of the initial angular momentum to its maximum value at a given distance , but it may depend on _ absolute _ values .",
    "particles with a larger mean orbit radius do not pass close to the centre .",
    "they also have a larger angular momentum  even if it is small compared to @xmath147 .",
    "simply put , in order to get to families b and i a small absolute value of @xmath146 is necessary , not relative to @xmath147 .",
    "in this paper we examined the impact of roi on the shape of dark matter haloes . for this purpose we performed seven different simulations of haloes with the same nfw density profile of virial radius @xmath148 kpc and concentration @xmath149 .",
    "the virial mass of each halo was equal to @xmath150 corresponding in size to haloes of dwarf galaxies obtained in cosmological simulations .    however , each model had a different initial radial dependence of the anisotropy parameter @xmath23 .",
    "three of them had a constant anisotropy , including an isotropic one .",
    "the next model was rather peculiar : it had a strongly anisotropic core but an isotropic envelope .",
    "the last three had and increasing @xmath12 profile , similar to haloes obtained in cosmological simulations .",
    "they differed in @xmath53  the transition scale between the isotropic core and the anisotropic envelope .",
    "the evolution of each halo was followed for 10 gyr using an @xmath0-body code .    among all seven haloes ,",
    "four underwent roi : two with the constant , non - zero anisotropy ( c2 and c3 ) , the only one with the decreasing @xmath23 ( d ) and the one with an increasing @xmath12 and the smallest @xmath53 ( i1 ) . in the three remaining haloes",
    "we did not notice any significant evolution of the shape .",
    "in all haloes that underwent the instability the final profiles of the axis ratios turned out to depend on radius . with the exception of model i1",
    ", haloes were elongated in the centres and remained spherical in the outer parts .",
    "halo i1 was spherical in the centre and had a minimum of the @xmath124 profile at a distance of about 2 kpc from the centre .",
    "all haloes became approximately axisymmetric and prolate .",
    "the density profiles of the haloes changed only slightly , which means that there were no large scale flows of matter .",
    "the profiles of @xmath23 measured in the planes perpendicular to the major axes of the haloes decreased significantly , whereas the ones measured along major axes remained almost unchanged .",
    "this indicates that the velocity distribution is axisymmetric .",
    "the mean @xmath146 of the haloes increased remarkably , in particular there were few particles with @xmath151 .",
    "this is due to large oscillations of the angular momentum components perpendicular to the symmetry axis .",
    "the component of the angular momentum along the symmetry axis is conserved with great accuracy .",
    "depending on the initial angular momentum , particles eventually join different orbit families .",
    "regions of membership are well separated in the planes of the angular momentum components .",
    "moreover , regions of different types of contribution to the halo shape also seem to be separable . for a large initial @xmath146",
    "the particle contribution is oblate .",
    "particles with a small @xmath146 join the families which make the shape of the halo more prolate . additionally , for small @xmath88 ( component along the later symmetry axis ) orbits",
    "are not axisymmetric , thus they contribute to the triaxiality of the halo and this may be related to the fact that the triaxiality increases with the anisotropy of the system .",
    "different reactions to the bar - like perturbation arise from different numbers of particles with a given angular momentum that may later join orbit families which make the halo non - spherical .    considering the influence of roi on the real dark matter",
    "haloes one has to bear in mind a few important issues .",
    "first , the infalling matter moves on rather elongated orbits and has small angular momentum relative to the centre of the halo .",
    "thus , it is quite likely that roi sets on during the halo growth making it triaxial or prolate .",
    "however , in reality haloes accumulate mass continuously , so the situation is different than the one considered in this work .",
    "second , it is unlikely that many haloes have a radial orbit distribution in their centre  in other words , in simulated haloes we never have @xmath152 significantly above zero .",
    "our simulations apply directly to haloes of dwarf galaxy size , but it seems that simple scaling is enough to adapt them to larger objects .",
    "one has to remember also that these results refer to isolated haloes . in the case of an interaction of a halo with another object",
    "some of the properties discussed above may change .",
