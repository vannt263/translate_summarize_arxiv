    "a recent result from the tevatron places a lower bound of 338 gev on the mass of the @xmath1 quark of a fourth family @xcite",
    ". this lower bound is narrowing the allowed mass window for fourth family quarks , since the upper bound allowed by partial wave unitarity is about 600 gev @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , depending on whether the masses are at the low or high end of this range a fourth family could still be characterized as `` light '' or `` heavy '' .",
    "the implications are profoundly different .",
    "the response to the discovery of a light fourth family may be `` who ordered _ that _ ? '' , while the discovery of a heavy family could cause a realization as in `` so _ that _ is the way nature works ! ''",
    "a light fourth family is introduced into the standard model in the hope that it can co - exist with the higgs boson .",
    "the new family significantly modifies the running of the quartic higgs coupling as reflected by the two new terms in @xmath2 involving the new large yukawa couplings .",
    "these terms must be carefully balanced to keep @xmath3 finite and positive at some higher scale @xmath4 , and this translates into a smaller allowed range of the higgs mass @xcite .",
    "the yukawa couplings @xmath5 also tend to quickly run into trouble at higher scales .",
    "perhaps these issues can be side - stepped if the yukawa and higgs couplings instead approach a nontrivial ultraviolet fixed point @xcite .",
    "more troublesome is the direct contribution to the higgs mass from the loop of fourth family fermions .",
    "if we are to take this seriously then there must be some new physics which acts to cut off this quadratically divergent contribution . assuming this effective cutoff is somewhat above the heavy quark masses , then these quarks act to shift the higgs mass by @xmath6 ^ 2\\lambda^2.\\ ] ] thus as the heavy quark masses approach 400 gev , the higgs mass in the absence of fine tuning is pushed up to the cutoff . when the higgs mass is pushed up to the scale where new physics must enter , then the original higgs description is no longer useful .",
    "when a fourth family becomes clearly `` heavy '' then it clearly can not co - exist with a light higgs .",
    "when @xmath7 600 gev then the goldstone bosons of electroweak symmetry breaking couple maximally strongly to the @xmath8 .",
    "the self - interactions of the goldstone bosons will also be strong and so strong interactions rather than a weak higgs exchange will unitarize @xmath9 scattering .",
    "a higgs not only loses meaning but it is also no longer needed , since the strong interactions can cause dynamical symmetry breaking and thus yield the goldstone bosons directly . following the cue of qcd",
    ", we can expect that a bilinear fermion condensate takes the place of the higgs vacuum expectation value .",
    "we also need an alternative to yukawa couplings for the generation of quark and lepton masses . in the presence of electroweak symmetry breaking fermion condensates of size @xmath10 , appropriate 4-fermion operators can feed mass down to other quarks and leptons .",
    "the origin of these 4-fermion operators imply the existence of new scales of flavor physics above the tev scale . if such a scale is @xmath11 then the resulting quark or lepton mass is of order @xmath12 .",
    "what then causes fermions to develop the needed condensates ?",
    "a new confining gauge interaction , technicolor , is one possibility , but another is to have new strong _ broken _ gauge interactions . it is for this latter possibility that we can identify the fermions developing condensates with the fourth family , since by definition a sequential fourth family does not feel any new unbroken gauge interaction .    the idea that new broken gauge interactions are involved with electroweak symmetry breaking is also economical .",
    "we have just mentioned that new flavor interactions well above the tev scale are responsible for feeding mass to light quarks and leptons . the gauge symmetry broken near a tev",
    "may then just be a remnant of this larger flavor gauge symmetry , where the latter only partially breaks at the higher scale .",
    "the remnant flavor interactions must yield effective 4-fermion operators that are strong enough to produce the electroweak scale condensates .",
    "thus broken flavor gauge interactions may hold the key to both electroweak symmetry breaking and quark and lepton masses .",
    "we return to the point that a heavy fourth family is incompatible with a light higgs .",
    "this provides strong motivation to search for a fourth family , given that the experimental signatures of a fourth family at the lhc are more accessible than those of a light higgs .",
    "it then becomes intriguing to wonder whether it is possible to rule out a light higgs before the search for it gets seriously under way .",
    "the answer to this question involves another question .",
    "how easy is it to tell a sequential quark of a fourth family from a `` vector quark '' ( vector - like in the sense that its mass preserves electroweak symmetry ) ? unlike sequential quarks , vector quarks are compatible with and are sometimes even motivated by a light higgs .",
    "vector quarks have unconstrained masses and they have decay modes involving the @xmath13 as well as the @xmath0 .",
    "we shall consider a method to distinguish vector quarks from sequential quarks in the next section .",
    "we first would like to consider what the early indications of a sequential fourth family at the lhc may look like .",
    "we shall assume that the dominant decay modes are @xmath14 we shall also assume that a @xmath15-tagger is not yet operational in the early searches",
    ". we can consider signatures that are indirect in the sense that they do not involve a full mass reconstruction of the heavy quark .",
    "a well studied method of this type is the search for same sign leptons from @xmath16 , where the backgrounds are believed to be small @xcite .",
    "but same sign leptons could also be a signal of other types of new physics , and so this search needs to be supplemented by other approaches .",
    "a strategy to be explored here is to focus on the excess of boosted and isolated @xmath0 s , that arise from both @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the hadronic decay of such @xmath0 s give rise to @xmath0-jets , and they have been studied in the context of the mass reconstruction of the heavy quarks @xcite",
    ". here we shall study the excess of @xmath0-jets directly by looking for a peak in the jet invariant mass distribution . to suppress backgrounds one of the other @xmath0 s",
    "is required to decay leptonically . in each event",
    "we shall consider the jet with the largest jet mass to construct the jet mass distribution .",
    "event generation and simulation details are as follows .",
    "signal and background events are generated by madgraph @xcite and alpgen @xcite respectively , along with pythia @xcite using tune 108 ( d6 ) with cteq6l1 .",
    "the primary backgrounds of interest are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and mlm jet matching is used with @xmath20 and 150 gev respectively .",
    "detector simulation is performed with pgs @xcite modified to use the anti-@xmath21 jet algorithm and using cms settings .",
    "we present results at @xmath22 tev for @xmath23 and at @xmath24 tev for @xmath25 gev .",
    "results are always normalized to a luminosity of 1 fb@xmath26 .",
    "we use a @xmath27 factor of 1.5 for both the pair production of heavy quarks and the @xmath18 background , as indicated by the nlo and nll cross sections in @xcite .",
    "these cross section results do not directly apply to the relevant @xmath18 background , where @xmath28 is large compared to the @xmath29 threshold , but the study in @xcite comparing mc@nlo to alpgen suggests that @xmath30 is reasonable .",
    "our @xmath19 background is dominated by 2 or more jets ; for @xmath31 a @xmath27 factor somewhat less than unity was found @xcite , and for @xmath32 the @xmath27 factor may be even less @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we set @xmath33 for this background .    for event selection",
    "we require three or more jets with @xmath34 gev and @xmath35 , as well as an @xmath36 defined as an isolated lepton with @xmath37 gev * or * missing @xmath38 gev .",
    "we focus on the jet with largest invariant mass in each selected event .",
    "this jet is required to be isolated , separated by @xmath39 from the other @xmath34 gev jets and @xmath36 , and if so its mass is used to form the histogram .",
    "there are two quantities that need to be adjusted to enhance the signal to background ratio : the value of @xmath40 for the @xmath28 cut and the jet resolution parameter @xmath41 .",
    "the optimal @xmath40 is about @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath41 should be large enough to make it likely that a single jet can capture the hadronic decay products of a @xmath0 produced in a heavy quark decay .",
    "thus the optimal @xmath41 also depends on @xmath43 , becoming smaller for larger @xmath43 .",
    "therefore the observed effect that the variation of @xmath40 and @xmath41 has on the signal can provide information about @xmath43 .",
    "the signal events are shown in fig .",
    "( 1 ) where it is seen that the @xmath44 and @xmath45 production contribute about equally to the strong peak at the @xmath0 mass .",
    "@xmath45 production has a larger high jet mass tail due to the presence of the @xmath46 in the final state .",
    "( 2 ) shows the combined signal and background for @xmath47 gev and @xmath48 .",
    "signal to background is degraded for a smaller @xmath40 , as seen in fig .",
    "( 3 ) where @xmath49 gev .",
    "the procedure of optimizing the results as a function of @xmath40 will thus help to determine @xmath43 . in fig .",
    "( 4 ) @xmath41 is increased to 0.8 , and this shows the sensitivity of the shape of the jet mass distribution to this quantity . increasing @xmath41 moves the distribution towards higher values as expected , but the signal remains strong .",
    "figure 1 : largest jet mass ( signal only )        figure 2 : largest jet mass ( combined signal and background )    we see that a strong @xmath0 mass peak does not show up in the background events .",
    "this is the key for isolating signal from background since it makes possible some type of side - band subtraction .",
    "it reflects the fact that this method is only really effective for identifying @xmath0 s that are both boosted and isolated .",
    "there are boosted @xmath0 s decaying hadronically in the @xmath50jets background , but they are typically not isolated due to a neighboring @xmath15 jet . for the @xmath51jets contribution the @xmath0",
    "is required to decay leptonically to satisfy event selection , so while qcd jets can fluctuate into large invariant masses this does not produce a @xmath0 peak . the @xmath51jets background could also be significantly reduced when @xmath15 tagging becomes available .",
    "figure 3 : largest jet mass ( @xmath40 reduced from 1200 gev to 1000 gev )        figure 4 : largest jet mass ( @xmath41 increased )    we next consider a reduced heavy quark mass of @xmath25 gev , and to place this in the context of the very early running of the lhc we also reduce the center of mass of energy to @xmath24 tev .",
    "the cuts are proportionally reduced to @xmath52 gev for jets and @xmath53 gev . in figs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) we display results for @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "these larger @xmath41 values are now more effective due to the typically smaller boosts of the @xmath0 s , and this illustrates further the way the shapes of the distributions as a function of @xmath41 will give information about @xmath43 .        figure 5 : largest jet mass ( smaller @xmath56 and @xmath43 )",
    "figure 6 : largest jet mass ( @xmath41 increased )    given the success of identifying @xmath0-jets from the signal events , we see why @xmath0-jets may be useful for a direct reconstruction of the heavy quark masses @xcite .",
    "we can show this here for the present set of parameters , and including both the @xmath57 and the @xmath1 contributions .",
    "the basic idea is to combine a @xmath0-jet with one other jet .",
    "events are selected to have only three jets having @xmath58 gev and @xmath35 , labelled @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "the @xmath0-jet , @xmath59 , has a jet mass within 12 gev of @xmath62 . with @xmath36 defined as before we require that @xmath36 be @xmath39 away from @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "we consider all possible ways of assigning objects to [ @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath36 ] . in each case",
    "we let the invariant mass of [ @xmath59 , @xmath60 ] contribute to the histogram .",
    "note that for the events which contribute , they each contribute at least twice to the histogram .",
    "this technique helps to avoid biasing the background contributions , thus suppressing a false peak in the background that often arises in traditional attempts at full event reconstruction .",
    "figure 7 : invariant mass of @xmath0-jet @xmath65 jet ( signal only )        figure 8 : invariant mass of @xmath0-jet @xmath65 jet ( combined signal and background )    fig .",
    "( 7 ) shows the peak in the reconstructed heavy quark mass for the signal events .",
    "the @xmath44 contribution gives a more realistic peak while the @xmath45 contribution is broader and extends to invariant masses below @xmath43 .",
    "this is understandable given that the @xmath60 jet for the latter case is attempting to capture the hadronic decay of the @xmath46 , where the @xmath46 is often not boosted enough for this to be effective .",
    "it is of interest to contrast the @xmath44 dominance in the heavy quark mass peak to the roughly equal @xmath44 and @xmath45 contributions in the previous @xmath0 mass peak .",
    "the relative strength of the @xmath0 and @xmath66 mass peaks could then in principle be used as evidence for the existence of both the @xmath57 and the @xmath1 .",
    "( 8) shows the combined signal and background while fig .",
    "( 9 ) shows the same for different choices of parameters .",
    "figure 9 : invariant mass of @xmath0-jet @xmath65 jet ( smaller @xmath56 and @xmath43 and larger @xmath41 )    we comment here on our use of large jet resolution parameters , @xmath41 in the range of 0.7 to 0.9 , and the possibility that this may imply sensitivity to multiple parton interactions and the underlying event . to test this we changed the underlying event model in pythia in the generation of the signal events .",
    "we changed from tune 108 ( old model ) to tune 326 ( new model ) and we found that this hardly degrades the signal .",
    "we also turned off the multiple parton interactions altogether , in which case the @xmath0 and heavy quark mass peaks are only somewhat sharper .",
    "we have described methods that will allow a fairly early discovery of heavy quarks with standard charged current decays .",
    "the next question is how to distinguish such sequential quarks from vector quarks . to illustrate the issues we consider a vector doublet of quarks @xmath67 because this most closely resembles the sequential quarks @xmath68 .",
    "the mixing of the vector quarks with @xmath46 and @xmath15 happens through yukawa couplings @xmath69 since the goldstone bosons are identified with the longitudinal modes of the gauge bosons , this mixing implies the following decay modes . @xmath70 as indicated by the color coding , @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) controls the branching fraction into modes involving @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) . but",
    "regardless of the relative size of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and for @xmath77 and @xmath78 of similar mass , the mixing as described implies that the proportions of @xmath0 , @xmath13 , and @xmath79 produced will be close to @xmath80 .",
    "this is also true of other varieties of vector quarks and top partners .",
    "this leads us to compare the production of like - sign leptons to the production of pairs of leptons that arise due to @xmath13 decay .",
    "the former can arise when at least three @xmath0 s are produced , as happens when at least one of the two heavy quarks decays to @xmath81 .",
    "thus like - sign leptons can occur for both sequential and vector quarks , while leptons from @xmath13 decay occur only for vector quarks . for suitable event selection",
    "the backgrounds for both processes can be made small .",
    "we therefore need only count the signal events , and we consider the case @xmath82 gev and @xmath23 gev with 1 fb@xmath26 .",
    "event selection for leptons from @xmath13 is : @xmath83 tev , [ 2 isolated leptons and @xmath84 100 gev ] or [ 3 isolated leptons ] , and @xmath85 or @xmath86 within 4 gev of the @xmath13 mass .",
    "the requirement of missing energy or an extra lepton eliminates the @xmath87jets background .",
    "this leaves @xmath88jets as the largest of the small backgrounds , and this could be reduced further with a @xmath15-tag .",
    "event selection for like - sign leptons is : @xmath83 tev , 2 isolated same - sign leptons , @xmath84 50 gev and @xmath89 gev .",
    "the backgrounds for this process are considered in @xcite .",
    "we find for the number of events , without a @xmath15-tag :    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the 1 to 7 corresponds to @xmath90 varying from 0 to @xmath91 .",
    "these results indicate that sequential quarks could be distinguished from vector quarks at roughly the same time that a new same sign lepton signal is detected .",
    "thus when heavy quark masses have been reconstructed or inferred and if leptons from @xmath13 are not observed at the rate at least comparable to same sign leptons , then we will have good evidence for new quarks belonging to a fourth family .",
    "the existence of a fourth family would cast a new light on the question of neutrino mass . a sufficiently heavy fourth neutrino is required and is at first sight strange ;",
    "this has even held back the consideration of a fourth family .",
    "a large neutrino mass is also often taken to imply that a large dirac mass is present ( with or without a separate majorana mass for the right - handed neutrino ) .",
    "this bias may also be faulty since there may well be no right handed neutrinos , at least at or below the tev scale . in particular no known gauge symmetry protects the @xmath92 s from receiving some mass much larger than a tev , from whatever dynamics existing at higher scales .    when we discussed the origin of mass for a heavy fourth family we described a new strong interaction that coupled to all members of the fourth family .",
    "thus the fourth neutrino mass could arise in a way similar to the other fourth family fermions , and in the absence of @xmath92 s this would imply a majorana mass for @xmath93 . in any case",
    "a fourth neutrino mass similar to the other fourth family members is not in itself unnatural , and the real question is why the other neutrinos are so light .    before pursuing that question",
    "we can look at the implications for electroweak precision observables .",
    "the effect of the majorana mass for a purely left - handed neutrino shows up in the last term in each of the following contributions to @xmath94 and @xmath77 @xcite . @xmath95 the presence of @xmath96 ( just somewhat larger than @xmath97 ) is associated with the dynamical nature of the mass and the fact that the mass function falls off quickly above this scale .",
    "( 10 ) illustrates these leptonic contributions as a function of @xmath98 while holding the other fourth family masses fixed .",
    "figure 10 : illustration of equations ( [ e5 ] ) and ( [ e6 ] ) .    in the absence of a light higgs ,",
    "a contribution to @xmath77 of the order 0.5 is needed .",
    "since @xmath99 is decreased by the new term , one needs a larger @xmath100 to obtain @xmath101 .",
    "one is forced to the right side of the plot which decreases @xmath102 further as shown , and this can thus cancel a larger portion of @xmath103 .",
    "larger values of @xmath98 and @xmath97 can also produce this effect , and the result is that any constraint on the relative size of @xmath104 and @xmath105 is lessened .",
    "thus while there was never a serious conflict between a fourth family and electroweak precision observables @xcite , a @xmath93 with a majorana mass makes a fourth family even easier to accommodate @xcite .",
    "let us return to the question of light neutrino masses by comparing them to their associated charged lepton masses .",
    "we relate the much lighter neutrino masses to our hypothesis that they are purely left handed .",
    "consider the following operators ( which can be written in an @xmath106 symmetric form ) that feed down mass from the @xmath107 to a light charged lepton @xmath108 ( or @xmath109 ) and a light neutrino @xmath110 ( or @xmath111 ) .",
    "@xmath112 @xmath113 the main point is that there is no 4-fermion operator that can feed mass from @xmath107 ( or @xmath57 or @xmath1 ) to the @xmath110 .",
    "then for example if @xmath114 tev and @xmath115 , the resulting illustrative lepton masses are @xmath116 ev .",
    "we note that the 6-fermion operator could result from 4-fermion operators that involve right - handed neutrinos after the latter are integrated out .",
    "thus it is quite consistent for the @xmath92 masses to be similar to the highest flavor scale , denoted here by @xmath11 . ) and ( [ e2 ] ) , which if present would increase @xmath11 . ]",
    "the large majorana mass for right handed neutrinos is a natural order parameter for the breaking of the original flavor gauge symmetries , including a possible @xmath117 .",
    "we can contrast this situation to the standard see - saw with higgs , which requires a much larger hierarchy between the @xmath92 masses and other masses ( or alternatively some very small yukawa couplings ) .",
    "there is in fact a 4-fermion operator that could feed down mass from the @xmath93 to the light neutrinos , of the form @xmath118 .",
    "this can also be written in an @xmath106 symmetric form and the @xmath119 here can be the @xmath108 , @xmath109 or @xmath120 neutrino . but this operator can be eliminated , or strongly suppressed , if ( fourth family lepton number ) @xmath121 ( third family lepton number ) is a symmetry , or a very good approximate symmetry of the flavor physics .",
    "the operators in ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) are allowed by this symmetry , while it is broken by the @xmath93 dynamical mass .",
    "this symmetry may correspond to a broken gauge symmetry , in which case the associated gauge boson may be a tev scale remnant of the original flavor gauge symmetry .",
    "similarly we consider 4-fermion operators that can feed down mass from the fourth family quarks to the third family quarks .",
    "@xmath122 @xmath123 here we note the effect of an approximate symmetry defined by the charges : @xmath124 this is ( fourth family axial quark number ) @xmath121 ( third family axial quark number ) and it may be the quark part of the same remnant flavor gauge symmetry already mentioned . the @xmath66 masses also contribute to its breaking . to the extent that it is a symmetry of the flavor physics it would suppress the two operators in ( [ e3 ] ) relative to the two operators in ( [ e4 ] ) .",
    "this is advantageous since the @xmath46 mass operator in ( [ e4 ] ) has suppressed impact on the @xmath125 coupling ; two insertions of this operator are needed due to its lrlr form @xcite .",
    "we mention in passing that the massive gauge boson associated with the remnant flavor gauge symmetry has its own implications for lhc physics @xcite .",
    "we have hopefully made it clear why a fourth family is interesting , and especially so if its masses are large enough to imply new strong interactions . despite the presence of strong interactions ,",
    "the standard weak decays of the heavy quarks make them quite easy to find or to rule out at the lhc .",
    "any modification of the production cross section due to the strong interactions should not change this conclusion .",
    "a crucial step will then be to distinguish fourth family quarks from vector quarks , for example in a manner we have described .",
    "the confirmation of heavy sequential quarks would bring an end to the long `` era of the higgs '' .",
    "it would cause the focus of the lhc , which has been to find the higgs , to suddenly shift . and it would also cause the focus of theorists to suddenly shift .",
    "theorists would see that new strong dynamics is showing up at the tev scale , right where it is needed .",
    "this would be a serious blow to anthropic thinking , and the concept of naturalness may return as an important criteria in the construction of physical theories .",

    "<S> given the large mass of the fourth neutrino we describe how a picture for neutrino mass emerges in the absence of right - handed neutrinos , and how it suggests the existence of a remnant flavor gauge symmetry . based on talk given at `` second workshop on beyond 3 generation standard model  new fermions at the crossroads of tevatron and lhc '' , january 2010 , taipei taiwan . </S>"
