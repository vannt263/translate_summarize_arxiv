    "abell 2218 is a very rich galaxy cluster ( richness class 4 , according to abell et al .",
    "1989 ) , characterized by a large velocity dispersion of the galaxy population ( @xmath1  km / s , le borgne et al .",
    "1992 ) , and a high x - ray temperature and luminosity ( @xmath2  kev , see e.g. markevitch 1997 , @xmath3 erg / s  km / s / mpc and @xmath4 in the energy band 0.54.4 kev , see e.g. kneib et al .",
    "1996 ) .    these properties , coupled to a relatively small distance ( @xmath5 , le borgne et al .",
    "1992 ) , made this cluster an attractive target for studies of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( birkinshaw & hughes 1994 ) , and one of the closest clusters where gravitational arcs are detected .",
    "the amazing concentration of gravitational arcs and arclets has stimulated a huge observational effort first to get sub - arcsec imaging ( from the ground , see , e.g. kneib et al .",
    "1995 , and from space with hst , kneib et al .",
    "1996 ) , and then to get spectra of the arcs ( ebbels et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the optical and near - ir observations have allowed a very detailed modelling of the mass distribution within the cluster ( kneib et al .",
    "1996 ) , confirmed later to a great level of accuracy , ( ebbels et al .",
    "it was found that the cluster mass distribution is bi - modal , with the main concentration centred on the cd galaxy .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness , as obtained via rosat observations , does not trace the gravitational potential as derived from the lensing analysis , a possible indication that the x - ray emitting gas is far from hydrostatic equilibrium ( kneib et al . 1996 ) .",
    "this would also explain the discrepancy in the x - ray and lensing mass estimates ( markevitch 1997 ) .",
    "in this paper we report on the mid - ir observations of abell 2218 done with isocam on - board esa s _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) satellite .",
    "the high sensitivity of isocam allows us to determine the photometric properties of lensed and cluster galaxies in the mid - ir band , thus widening the wavelength coverage of their spectra .",
    "mid - ir observations are critical in understanding the intrinsic nature of these distant galaxies , since a starburst is known to emit a large fraction of its energy in the mid - ir , due to dust grain re - processing of the emitted radiation .",
    "abell 2218 was observed on march 3 , 1996 and again on february 28 , 1997 as part of an iso program of observations of lensing galaxy clusters with arcs and arclets : abell 370 , abell 2218 , cl2244 - 02 and ms2137 - 23 .",
    "an important criterion for target selection was to choose the clusters with the brightest arcs in the optical , spatially extended and the farthest from the lens , due to the limited spatial resolution of iso .",
    "+ the observations were performed by rastering in microscanning mode yielding to very deep isocam images of the galaxy cluster .",
    "the pixel field - of - view was 3@xmath6 and the microscanning steps were 7@xmath6 in both directions of the 5x5 raster .",
    "the cluster was imaged in the 4 filter bands , lw1 [ 4 - 5@xmath0 m ] , lw2 [ 5 - 8.5@xmath0 m ] , lw7 [ 8.5 - 11@xmath0 m ] , and lw3 [ 12 - 18@xmath0 m ] , at 5 or 10 sec integration times for a total observing time of 5.5 hours , covering a field of more than 2x2 arcminutes .",
    "the data reduction was done partly within the idl based ( iso)cam interactive analysis ( cia ) package ( ott et al . , 1997 ) and partly through the usage of",
    "c++ based multi - resolution median transform ( _ wavelet _ ) techniques ( starck j .- l .",
    "et al , 1997 ) .",
    "cross - correlation of the two methods allows us to increase the reliability of source detection .",
    "the lw1 , lw2 and lw3 maps are presented in figures 1 & 2a , as overlays on top of the hst image ( courtesy j .-",
    "kneib ) of abell 2218 .    in the cluster core",
    ", no arclet is detected at a significant level at any wavelength in the mid - ir .",
    "this non - detection of arcs or arclets contrasts with our recent mid - ir imaging of abell 370 ( metcalfe et al .",
    "1997 ) , where the a0 giant arc is clearly detected as the main feature and emitter in the cluster core at 15@xmath0 m .",
    "but this giant arc is already a prominent feature in the optical , ( first giant arc discovered ) , whereas arcs and arclets are fainter in abell 2218 .",
    "+ the cd galaxy which is apparently centred on the cluster potential is clearly detected in the lw1 & lw2 filter bands . at 4.5@xmath0 m ( rest - frame wavelength 3.8 @xmath0 m )",
    "the cd emission is extended , covering part of the optical halo ; at 7@xmath0 m the emission is much more confined to the centre , but with an extension along the optical major axis , probably contaminated by the neighbouring merging dwarf galaxies . at 10@xmath0 m and 15@xmath0 m",
    "it lies just above the detection limit of isocam and no statement can be made on its extension .",
    "the mid - ir spectral energy distribution up to 15@xmath0 m seems to follow a simple rayleigh - jeans tail of the cold stellar component as found in optically - selected normal early - type galaxies ( e , s0 , s0a ) in the virgo cluster ( boselli et al .",
    "1998 ) . but due to the contamination by close - by galaxies it is very difficult to estimate the 4.5@xmath0 m flux of the cd .",
    "+ the brightest cluster member galaxies are also detected at 4.5 @xmath0 m and 7 @xmath0 m . at the redshift of the cluster the 4.5 @xmath0 m emission is mostly coming again from cold stellar photospheres .",
    "the 7 @xmath0 m ( lw2 band ) ( rest - frame 5.7 @xmath0 m ) emission includes a small fraction of pah emission but comes mainly again from the cold stellar photospheres . at 10 & 15 microns",
    "most of cluster members have vanished ( ie . are below or very close to our detection limit ) , as expected for normal early - type galaxies ( ellipticals ) where there is only the rayleigh - jeans tail mid - ir emission from cold stellar photospheres , in dust & gas poor cluster core ellipticals .",
    "+ still one cluster member galaxy # 373 ( numbering system from le borgne et al .",
    "1992 in the following ) is detected at 15@xmath0 m , but also at 4.5 @xmath0 m and 7 @xmath0 m , it has a cart - wheel like aspect , from the ring surrounding it and is probably a big face - on spiral galaxy .",
    "the 4.5@xmath0 m and 7@xmath0 m emission comes mostly from the nucleus whereas the 15@xmath0 m originates apparently from the ring structure .",
    "it could be pah and small hot grain emission enhanced by star formation in tidal shocks in the ring.    object # 323 is detected at 15 @xmath0 m .",
    "this object was suspected to be an arclet candidate in the first deep multi - filter ground - based imaging ( pello et al .",
    "1992 ) , since it appeared as a fine unresolved extended structure , together with another 32 arclets in total .",
    "it is classified as one of the 235 arclet candidates in the first hst observation of abell 2218 ( kneib et al .",
    "however , as noted by kneib et al . , it was also suspected not to be a strongly lensed object when comparison is made with shear orientation .",
    "this was again confirmed by ebbels et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , object # 323 being very elongated but at an angle of 45 degrees from the shear direction .",
    "identification of several absorption features in its spectrum reveal it to be a cluster member at a redshift of z=0.179 , a spiral seen edge - on .    to our surprise",
    "the brightest source by far from 7@xmath0 m to 15@xmath0 m is object # 395 , an apparently insignificant z=0.1032 ( le borgne 1992 ) foreground sb galaxy , showing an ultraviolet excess and a strong h@xmath7 emission line , both indicating strong star formation of massive stars .",
    "most of this mid - ir emission could then originate from the reprocessing by the small hot dust heated by a strong uv radiation field .",
    "the second strongest emitter at long wavelength ( from 10@xmath0 m to 15@xmath0 m ) , but much less at shorter wavelengths is object # 317 , a lensed galaxy at z=0.474 ( ebbels et al .",
    "1997 ) , a rather red object from the visible to the mid - ir .",
    "first indications show that this type of lensed object is common on our larger field imaging towards lensing clusters ( metcalfe et al .",
