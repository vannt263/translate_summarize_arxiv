    "recently , motivated by the study of diffusive trajectories performed by animals in various conditions , blanco and fournier @xcite reported an important result concerning the mean first exit time of pearson random walks @xcite in a bounded domain . beyond the applications for animal trajectories , numerous physical systems are concerned , such as the neutron scattering processes @xcite .",
    "pearson random walks can be defined by the trajectory of a particle which is submitted at stochastic times to random reorientations of the direction of its constant velocity @xmath0 .",
    "the stochastic times are exponentially distributed with mean value @xmath1 . for this category of random walks , blanco and",
    "fournier showed that the mean first exit time @xmath2 of a random walk starting from the boundary of a finite domain is independent of the frequency @xmath3 and is simply related to the ratio of the domain s volume @xmath4 over the surface @xmath5 of the domain s boundary , namely in three dimension :    @xmath6    the fact that this result does not depend on the frequency @xmath3 but only on the geometry of the system seems counter - intuitive , although blanco and fournier propose some heuristic explanation for it . very recently , following the demonstration of blanco and fournier , mazzolo @xcite extended their results and gave a relation between the @xmath7th moment of the first exit time of a particle starting inside the domain , and the @xmath8th moment of the first exit time of a particle starting from the boundary .    in this paper",
    ", we present an alternative approach , which allows us to extend these results in three directions .",
    "first , we consider the case of any combination of absorbing and reflecting boundary conditions , which is useful in many applied stochastic processes .",
    "second , we study not only first exit time properties , but also residence time within a sub - domain properties ( prior to the first exit of the domain ) , which is a more general quantity .",
    "last , we show that these results can be generalized for a wide class of stochastic motions .",
    "before considering the case of a general motion , we restrict our discussion to the previously examined pearson walks , which corresponds to a succession of deterministic ballistic movements in the bounded domain @xmath4 delimited by an absorbing boundary @xmath9 , interrupted by instantaneous and isotropic redistributions of the velocity @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath11 be the conditional density probability at time @xmath12 that the particle is at position @xmath13 with a velocity @xmath14 , given that it starts initially at position @xmath15 with a velocity @xmath10 .",
    "this quantity satisfies the well - known backward chapman - kolmogorov differential equation @xcite :    @xmath16,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 stands for the solid angle in @xmath18-dimension and the integral @xmath19 is taken over unit vectors in the direction of the velocity .",
    "this equation can be easily converted into an equation for the moments of the first exit time @xmath20 starting from @xmath15 with the initial velocity @xmath10@xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the @xmath7th moment of the first exit time , which verifies @xmath23 on the absorbing boundary ( @xmath24 ) , for all @xmath25 and for an outward velocity .",
    "noting that the symmetric quantity @xmath26 obviously equals zero , and that @xmath27 , the integration of equation ( [ timemoment ] ) over all possible initial positions and velocities gives : @xmath28 applying the gauss divergence theorem on the left - hand side of the equation ( [ intt ] ) , we can write that : @xmath29 where the two averages involved in equation ( [ timesv ] ) are defined for any function @xmath30 as follows : @xmath31 with @xmath32 is the inward flux of a unit , isotropically distributed vector through a unit surface , and @xmath33 is a dimension dependent constant . equation ( [ timesv ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath34 which corresponds to the results previously obtained by blanco and fournier@xcite and mazzolo@xcite .",
    "parenthetically , we know that since @xmath35 , ( [ fmat ] ) yields a general lower bound for @xmath36 : @xmath37",
    "we now extend these results , which take unexpected simple forms , to the general case of mixed boundary conditions .",
    "the domain s boundary @xmath9 is now supposed to be composed of any combination of absorbing and reflecting parts ( see fig.[f.1],[f.2 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath38 be the absorbing part of @xmath9 , and @xmath39 its reflecting part , so that @xmath40 .",
    "we assume that initially the particle starts from the absorbing surface . whether we consider that the reflecting boundary is perfect , i.e. that the inward velocity angle equals the outward velocity angle , or whether we consider that the particle s velocity angle is uniformly redistributed after each collision with the reflecting boundary , we have @xmath41 in this case of mixed boundary conditions , equation ( [ fmat ] ) becomes : @xmath42    let us , for instance , consider animals leaving their home through its boundary @xmath38 , and exploring a domain @xmath4 ( see fig.[f.1 ] ) .",
    "the previous equation gives a simple estimate of their mean return time to home if the boundary @xmath39 is reflecting for them , provided that the interrupted ballistic motion correctly models their behaviour .",
    "consider now a closed volume @xmath4 with two absorbing surfaces @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and let us compute the absorption probability @xmath45 on the surface @xmath43 for a particle starting initially from the boundary @xmath46 .",
    "this probability obeys the differential equation @xcite : @xmath47=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for which the boundary conditions , for an outward velocity @xmath10 , are @xmath48 and @xmath49 . following the same lines as previously , one can show that @xmath50 in other words , the splitting probability through absorbing boundary is uniform , when starting uniformly from any point of it .",
    "a relevant quantity involved in the theory of chemical reactivity and in other similar problems@xcite , is the residence time in a sub - domain @xmath51 ( see fig.[f.3 ] ) of the domain @xmath4 . in order to study it , we assume that the particle can disappear in @xmath51 ( but not outside @xmath51 ) with a constant and uniform reaction rate @xmath52 .",
    "the central quantity is now the survival probability of the particle with respect to the reaction in volume @xmath51 ( i.e. considering that _ an absorption on the boundary is not a killing process _ ) , which can be expressed in two ways @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the residence time up to the observation time @xmath12 inside @xmath51 of the particle , starting from @xmath55 , and @xmath11 is the conditional density probability of the particle which satisfies the following backward chapman - kolmogorov differential equation :    @xmath56\\\\ & & -k{\\bf 1 } _ { v'}(\\vec{r } ) p(\\vec{r'},\\vec{v'},t|\\vec{r},\\vec{v})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath57 is the indicator function of @xmath51 which equals zero if @xmath58 and equals one if @xmath59 .",
    "note that the boundary conditions give @xmath60 for an outward velocity of a particle on the absorbing surface @xmath38 .",
    "indeed , such a particle absorbed on this surface will never disappear within the sub - domain @xmath51 .",
    "writing down the equation ( [ bck ] ) for the conditional survival probability , we obtain : @xmath61\\nonumber\\\\                                     &    &   -k { \\bf 1}_{v'}(\\vec{r } ) s(t|\\vec{r},\\vec{v}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as @xmath62 is a bounded non - increasing function of @xmath12 , it tends to a finite limit as @xmath63 , so much @xmath64 .",
    "letting @xmath63 in ( [ seq ] ) , integrating it over @xmath65 and @xmath10 , taking into account the boundary conditions and using the expansion ( see ( [ defs ] ) when @xmath63 ) @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the @xmath7th moment of the residence time of the particle inside @xmath51 for an infinite observation time , we derive our main result for the residence time : @xmath68    note that the mean fraction of time spent inside @xmath51 prior to the first exit of @xmath4 is given by @xmath69 , which can be seen as an ergodic type property@xcite .",
    "let us now assume that the particle undergoes a more general stochastic diffusion process , interrupted at stochastic times by an instantaneous redistribution of its velocity , without changing its position .",
    "the conditional density probability @xmath11 to be at position @xmath13 with velocity @xmath14 at time @xmath12 , starting from @xmath55 at time 0 , corresponding to the general diffusion process obeys the backward equation @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the mass of the particle , @xmath72 is the force exerted on the particle in state @xmath55 , @xmath73 is the general diffusion matrix , and @xmath74 stands for the adjoint of @xmath75 . in many situations of physical interest ,",
    "@xmath76 is the sum of a conservative force due to a potential @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and of a friction force @xmath79 due to a surrounding fluid , @xmath80 being a constant friction coefficient . furthermore , @xmath81 , @xmath82 being the usual diffusion coefficient of the fick law , which is independent of @xmath15 in an homogeneous medium .",
    "now , we assume that this general diffusion process is interrupted at stochastic times , for which the velocity @xmath83 of the particle is instantaneously redistributed with a given transition rate @xmath84 .",
    "the overall stochastic process , including the velocity reorientation , obeys the equation : @xmath85 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv&{\\cal l}^{+ } p(\\vec{r'},\\vec{v'},t|\\vec{r},\\vec{v}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the conditional probability density at time @xmath12 , @xmath11 also obeys the following forward equation : @xmath86 let us assume that this equation , when the whole boundary @xmath9 is assumed to be reflecting , admits a stationary solution @xmath87 .",
    "for instance @xmath87 is the thermodynamic equilibrium @xmath88 if equation ( [ general ] ) is the usual diffusion equation of a particle in an equilibrium fluid at temperature @xmath89 and if the velocity redistribution process defined previously does not affect this thermodynamic equilibrium , which is the case if @xmath90 .",
    "then it is possible to generalize the previous results .",
    "indeed , let us consider the residence time of the particle in a sub - domain @xmath91 , and let @xmath38 be the absorbing part of the total surface @xmath9 .",
    "as previously , we assume that inside @xmath51 , the particle can disappear with a constant and uniform reaction rate @xmath52 .",
    "its conditional survival probability at time @xmath12 , @xmath92 , starting from @xmath93 obeys the backward equation @xmath94 where @xmath95 if @xmath59 and 0 otherwise . following the method used for the pearson random walks",
    ", we let @xmath96 in ( [ 38 ] ) , and we multiply this equation by the equilibrium probability @xmath97 computed for the reflecting conditions on the boundary @xmath9 of @xmath4 . the integration of equation ( [ 38 ] ) over all @xmath65 and @xmath10 , leads to : @xmath98 the left hand side of ( [ 20 ] ) can be transformed into    @xmath99    the first integral vanishes , since @xmath100 if @xmath101 . in the second integral",
    "we separate the inward and outward integration over @xmath10 in the surface integral .",
    "the inward part can be written , using the expansion ( [ expan ] ) of @xmath102 : @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the one - way equilibrium probability current on @xmath38 , and the surface average of a quantity @xmath105 is defined as : @xmath106 the outward part is actually equal to @xmath107 , as @xmath108 if @xmath109 and @xmath10 points outward . then , comparing both sides of ( [ 20 ] ) , we generalize the relations ( [ residencetime ] ) for the moments of the residence time within @xmath51 : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the equilibrium probability of volume @xmath51 .",
    "considering now the special case @xmath112 , we obtain the relations for the moments of the first exit time from @xmath4 : @xmath113 which generalize the formulas ( [ fmat ] ) . in the same way , the results of the splitting probabilities ( [ split ] )",
    "can be generalized for the general stochastic motion discussed here .",
    "equation ( [ genetps ] ) takes a particularly simple form if we now consider a fluid of identical particles and if we replace @xmath87 by the equilibrium density of particles in the phase space @xmath55 .",
    "then , the probability current @xmath107 is replaced by the equilibrium one - way flux of particles @xmath114 through @xmath9 , and equation ( [ genetps ] ) becomes :    @xmath115    @xmath116 being the number of particle in @xmath4 .",
    "this formula can easily be understood intuitively : if at time @xmath117 the boundary is supposed to be reflecting , the number of particles leaving @xmath4 per unit time should be @xmath118 , so that the equilibrium is maintained inside @xmath4 if @xmath4 is supplied with an entering flux of new particles @xmath119 .",
    "we have shown that the geometrical relations previously obtained for person random walks in bounded domains , are particular cases of very general relations between residence times for a large class of stochastic processes .",
    "thus , they can be very useful in many applications , when the evolution equations can not be solved exactly .",
    "furthermore they can be extended to intermittent systems , which are frequent in biology@xcite .",
    "lastly , with relevant changes , this work can be extended to discrete space and time systems .",
    "such extensions are in progress ."
