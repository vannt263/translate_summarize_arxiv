    "the study of the physical properties of hii regions and their classification is a fundamental key to understand how they evolute and how stars form .",
    "the radio continuum emission at centimeter wavelengths traces the emission of the ionized gas . in the other hand ,",
    "the study of the molecular gas next to hii regions provides significant information about these objects and issues of star formation theory applied to these objects .",
    "so far , most of the studies of the molecular gas are based on co emission , which has a low dipole moment , implying that low rotational transitions do not trace dense gas , while molecules with higher dipole moments can be used to observe high density gas . the high density cores ( @xmath21 )",
    "can be studied from mm and submm line emission of the hcn and hco@xmath0 molecules @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we use 1.3 and 3.6  cm very large array images to study the physical conditions of the gas in the ultracompact hii region g75.78 + 0.34 , as well as berkley illinois maryland association ( bima ) interferometric data at 3 mm .",
    "this object presents a well known molecular outflow observed in co @xcite and hcn @xcite , is located the giant molecular cloud on2 and was firstly identified by @xcite with observations at 5 and 10.7 ghz .",
    "@xcite used the vla observations to study the gas content of g75.78 + 0.34 .",
    "they found radio emission coming from three components : a cometary ultracompact hii region , excited by a b0 type star , and with no associated dust emission , an almost unresolved ultracompact h ii region , associated with a compact dust clump detected at millimetric and mid - infrared wavelengths and a compact source embedded in a dust condensation .",
    "the continuum emission at 3.5  mm of g75.78 + 0.34 is dominated by free - free emission from the ionized gas surrounding the exciting star and dust emission may contribute only with a small fraction of its 3.5 mm continuum @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the observations , section 3 presents our results , which are discussed in section 4 .",
    "the conclusions of this work are presented in section 5 .",
    "the observations of the emission of hco@xmath22 at 89.1885 ghz and hcn@xmath23 at 88.63ghz from g75.78 + 0.34 and g75.77 + 0.34 were performed with the berkley illinois maryland association ( bima ) interferometer @xcite in june , 1999 using its shortest baseline configuration ( d - array ) .",
    "mars and 3c273 observations were used as primary amplitude and bandpass calibrators and the data reduction followed standard procedures with the software miriad @xcite .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the synthesized map is about 18 arcsec and the resulting velocity sampling is @xmath24 .",
    "the hcn emission has already been presented and discussed in @xcite , where more details about the observations and data reduction process can be found . here , we present and discuss the spectrum for the hco@xmath0 .",
    "we used very large array ( vla ) radio - continuum observations of g75.78 + 0.34 at 8.46  ghz ( 3.6 cm ) and 22.46  ghz ( 1.3 cm ) from the vla data archive obtained using the interferometric array at configuration  a \" .",
    "these observations were processed following the standard procedure of vla radio continuum imaging processing using the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "the angular resolution at these frequencies are 024 and 008 for 3.6  cm and 1.3  cm observations , respectively .",
    "these resolutions corresponds to a spatial resolution of @xmath25pc and @xmath26pc assuming a distance of 5.6kpc to g75.78 + 0.34 @xcite from which we estimate the sizes of the main components a , b and c are respectively 0.065 , 0.013 and 0.027 pc .",
    "in figure  [ 22 ] we show the 1.3 cm continuum image of g75.78 + 34 , showing thee components identified as a , b and c in the figure .",
    "our image is in good agreement with the one presented by @xcite using the same instrument configuration .",
    "the component a show a complex structure , being more extended to the north - south direction and presenting at least two knots of higher emission .",
    "it is associated to the cometary hii region observed at 6 cm by @xcite and their image appears to be smoother than ours , probably because of its lower spatial resolution . in the other hand ,",
    "the components b and c are more compact and were not detected at 6 cm .",
    "the component c is co - spatial with the water maser emission detected by @xcite .",
    "the 3.6  cm image of g75.78 + 0.34 is shown in figure  [ 8 ] , showing the same three components observed at the 1.3  cm image . the complex structure seen for the component a at 1.3  cm is not seen at 3.6  cm image , because of its lower spatial resolution .",
    "our 3.6  cm image is very similar to the one shown by @xcite .",
    "the linear sizes of the components seen at 3.6  cm image are similar to those listed above for the 1.3  cm image .",
    "[ fluxes ]    .total flux and peak intensity for each component of g75.78 + 0.34 at 1.3  cm and 3.6  cm . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table  2 we present the physical parameters estimated by the equations above , which can be compared with previous estimates from the literature .",
    "the values obtained for the electron density are in reasonable agreement with those obtained by @xcite from the 6  cm radio emission ( @xmath27 ) and with the value obtained from 7 mm observations ",
    "@xmath28 @xcite , as well as with the one found by @xcite from a multi - frequency study ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the emission measure found here is between the values found by @xcite of @xmath30 , by @xcite of @xmath31 and the one from @xcite of @xmath32 .",
    "@xcite found @xmath33 and @xmath34 and thus , our values obtained from the 1.3  cm emission are in good agreement with theirs , while those estimated from the 3.6  cm are a bit smaller .",
    "the mass of g75.78 + 0.34 obtained here is about one order of magnitude smaller than the value found by @xcite and about one order of magnitude larger than the value obtained by @xcite , probably due to differences in the size of the region used to integrate the flux by these authors and by us , as well as due to the assumptions used in the calculations .",
    "the parameters presented in table  [ physpar ] confirm that g75.78 + 0.34 is an ultracompact hii region @xcite , confirming previous results of @xcite .    for the components b and c",
    ", we estimate the physical parameters using only the 1.3  cm image , since it has the highest spatial resolution . for the component",
    "b , we obtain @xmath35@xmath36 , @xmath37 and a mass of ionized gas of @xmath38  m@xmath10 , assuming a radius of 0.25 arcsec for the region . assuming a radius of 0.4 arcsec for the component c , we obtain @xmath39@xmath36 , @xmath40 and @xmath41  m@xmath10 .",
    "these values are similar to those espected for ultracompact hii regions @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite identified the component c as being an ultracompact hii region associated to dust emission in the millimetric and mid - infrared wavelengths , while the component b seems to be embedded in dust .      although , the signal - to - noise ratio of the hco@xmath0 data was not high enough to construct flux and channel maps , as it has been done for the hcn in @xcite using the same data , its detection can tell us some information about the star - forming region g75.78 + 0.34 . the complex line profile shown in fig .",
    "[ spec ] suggests that the hco@xmath0 emission is originated from gas with a disturbed kinematics and since it is usually originated from high density gas , the hco@xmath0 emission may be tracing also the bipolar molecular outflows observed in hcn for g75.78 + 0.34 in our previous paper .",
    "a similar conclusion has been presented for the serpens star - forming region using bima observations by @xcite , for which it is found that the hcn and hco@xmath0 present enhanced emission near outflows , while the n@xmath42h@xmath0 reflects the distribution of the cloud .      besides the bima data , we have also employed the swedish - eso submillimeter telescope ( sest ) in 20th april 2003 in order to detect higher excitation lines like sio ( 2 - 1 at 86.646 ghz ) , sio ( 3 - 2 at 130.268 ghz ) and sio ( 5 - 4 at 217.104 ghz ) and sio ( 8 - 7 , 347.330 ghz ) to make a spectral line survey of maser emission from g75.78 + 0.34 and g75.77 + 0.34 at higher excitations . even with longer integration times of about one hour per transition , we were unable to detect these lines at a confidence better than @xmath43 above the instrumental noise level",
    ".    on the other hand , the h@xmath44cn at 86.338 ghz was present in our sest observations , presenting a similar profile than the one of the hcn ( 1 - 0 ) suggesting that the emission may occur within zones of similar physical and kinematical conditions .",
    "our observations therefore suggest that sio lines may not be good observational tracers of shock - driven outflows in g75.78 + 0.34 .",
    "this conclusion is supported in a similar result obtained for the star - forming core w3-se using the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) by @xcite , in which the authors report the detection of the hco@xmath0 associated to outflows , while the sio ( 2 - 1 ) line at 86.243 ghz was also not detected for w3-se in independent observations .",
    "this certainly brings the fact that there are difficulties in using sio to obtain information on the astrophysical conditions of this compact object within the production of sio by destruction of dust grains by radiatively - driven mhd shock front from young and massive stars .    on the other hand",
    ", we must emphasize that there are several works for uchii regions and more evolved objects showing that the sio is a good tracer of outflows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a possible explanation for the absence of excited sio lines in g75.78 + 0.34 could be due to low sensitivity of the sest observations .",
    "new and more sensitivity observations are henceforth needed to better constrain the sio emission or its absence in g75.78 + 0.34 and to unravel such apparently contradictory statements .",
    "we studied the radio continuum and molecular emission from the star forming region g75.78 + 0.34 using vla and bima observations .",
    "our main conclusions are :    * the 3.6 and 1.3  cm radio continuum images for the hii region g75.78 + 0.34 present three components , one associated to the cometary hii region , other located at 6@xmath1 east of the cometary hii region and another structure located at 2@xmath1 south of it .",
    "* the cometary hii region present an electron density of @xmath21.5@xmath310@xmath4 , an emission measure of @xmath26@xmath310@xmath5 , ionized gas of @xmath6 and a diameter of 0.05pc , consistent with the values expected for an ultracompact hii region . *",
    "the hco@xmath0 ( j=1 - 0 ) seems to be originated from the gas which follows the same astrophysical conditions of outflows previously observed in main hcn transitions .",
    "nevertheless , new interferometric observations with enhanced sensitivity and resolution are needed to better constraint the hco@xmath0 origin in g75.78 + 0.34 . *",
    "the sio higher transitions up to 200 ghz were not detected using single dish observations with sest of g75.78 + 0.34 , suggesting that either it is not a good tracer of outflows in dense cores or that more sensitivity is needed at those relevant frequencies .",
