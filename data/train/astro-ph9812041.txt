    "quasars have long been mysterious points of light in our sky . originally turning up as star - like radio sources in the early radio surveys of the late 1950s , their spectra remained a puzzle until maarten schmidt s realization ( schmidt 1963 ) that their emission lines are as those seen in emission line galaxies ( seyfert 1943 ) , but greatly redshifted .",
    "the `` discovery object '' was 3c  273 with a redshift of 0.158 .",
    "this placed quasars billions of light years away and made them the most distant and luminous entities in the universe .",
    "as more were discovered , the redshift limit was pushed ever higher , meaning that we were probing ever - earlier epochs in our universe s history .",
    "soon it was realized that if we could establish quasars as``standard luminosity candles '' , we could determine their distances independent of their redshifts and thus determine the expansion history of the universe .",
    "thirty - five years later ( my lifetime ) we are still puzzling over the story that quasars are telling us .",
    "while a comprehensive understanding of the quasar phenomenon remains illusive , a standard model has emerged : a supermassive black hole in the nucleus of a massive galaxy accretes matter at rate @xmath2 , converting gravitational potential energy into light ( @xmath4 ; @xmath5 ) and mechanical energy ( blandford & rees 1978 ; rees 1984 ) .",
    "evidence continues to trickle in that quasars represented a dynamically active stage in the lives of massive galaxies ( mcleod & riecke 1995a , 1995b ; bahcall et al .",
    "1997 ; mclure et al .",
    "1998 ) , with the masses of their central black holes related to the host galaxy s halo mass ( haehnelt , natarajan , & rees 1998 ; laor 1998 , and these proceedings ) .",
    "the rapid appearance of quasars with redshifts @xmath6 was likely associated with massive galaxy formation ( boyle & terlevich 1998 ; haehnelt et al .",
    "1998 ; miller & percival 1998 ; silk & rees 1998 ) .",
    "quasars are now extinct , though their low luminosity cousins , the seyfert galaxies , are still found in the here and now . during their reign ,",
    "the quasar `` central engines '' poured out tremendous numbers of uv / x - ray photons . in the standard model the mass of the central black hole and the mass accretion rate together determine the quasar s luminosity and continuum spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the central engine of a quasar is manifested in the accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole .",
    "this process releases energy , much of this in the form of light at ionizing energies ( e.g. , mathews & ferland 1987 ) which is generally unobservable due the opacity of the intergalactic and interstellar media .",
    "therefore , we can not discern directly how a large fraction of the energy in the central engine is dissipated . however , some of these continuum photons are intercepted by gas of unknown origin moving rapidly in the black hole s gravitational potential .",
    "these photons ionize and heat this non - lte gas , which responds by producing the quasar broad emission line spectrum .",
    "the recombination lines of ly@xmath7 @xmath81216 and he  ii @xmath81640 are a measure of the numbers of photons lying just shortward of 912   and 228   , respectively . the ratio of the intensities of the strongest line coolant , c  iv @xmath81549 , to the strongest recombination line , ly@xmath7 , measures the cooling per recombination , or the heating per photoionization , and thus reflects the energy balance of the gas . since the energy from the continuum source absorbed by the gas must equal the energy emitted by the gas , the emission lines serve as an indirect means to measure the ionizing continuum .",
    "this and the likelihood that the emission line widths are indicative of the central gravitational potential well mean that we can hope to learn from the emission lines the nature of the central engines of quasars .",
    "the emission line spectra of quasars must be leaving clues , albeit apparently subtle ones , as to the origin and nature of the emitting gas . for a discussion of this see my other contribution to these conference proceedings .",
    "the strengths of the heavy element emission lines in even the highest redshift quasars give testimony to the heavy element enrichment from stellar evolution that had to occur within the first billion years of cosmic history .",
    "if they can be understood , quasar emission lines will elucidate the chemical evolution of galactic nuclei over the time span of @xmath9  10%  90% the age of the universe ( hamann & ferland 1993 ; hamann & ferland 1999 ; hamann , these proceedings ) .",
    "quasars are known to have evolved in number density and luminosity over past 10 or so billion years .",
    "their rapid rise at high redshifts ( presumably due to galaxy formation ) , their reign near @xmath10 , and their demise at lower redshifts , as the source of gas `` ran dry '' and/or the accretion mechanism itself failed ( haiman & menou 1998 ) , is reasonably well established ( boyle , shanks , & peterson 1988 ; boyle 1991 ; hewett , foltz , & chaffee 1993 ; goldschmidt & miller 1997 ; la franca & cristiani 1997 ; graham , clowes , & campusano 1998 ) .",
    "quasar evolution may be tied to the dynamical and chemical evolution of massive galaxies ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "but we do not understand these things at the fundamental level .",
    "quasar emission lines , mirroring the action occurring in galactic nuclei , are keys to unlocking these mysteries .      since the 1970s we ve known of the so - called `` ly@xmath7 '' forest of absorption lines in the spectra of quasars representing matter along the line of sight to the quasar .",
    "the statistics in number and character of the ly@xmath7 forest demonstrate an evolution with look - back time in the gas that may represent galaxies , protogalaxies , or failed galaxies .",
    "however , quasars themselves are strewn throughout most of cosmic history and their intrinsic light must be telling us something about that history .",
    "their connection to galaxy evolution is an example .",
    "another is if their light could be somehow established as a standard luminosity candle , we might establish the expansion history and fate of the universe .",
    "detailed analysis of quasar spectra became possible in the late 1970s with the advent of sensitive electronic spectrographs .",
    "it was at this time that a young astronomer by the name of jack baldwin was compiling spectral characteristics of quasars , when he came across something interesting .",
    "this is a brief summary of the situation . for a more complete review",
    "the reader is directed to the conference proceedings contribution from osmer & shields .",
    "uncharacteristic of galactic emission line sources ( e.g. , novae , pne , h  ii regions ) , the spectra of quasars are remarkably homogeneous .",
    "the same emission lines sitting atop a `` blue bump '' continuum , with similar intensity ratios , are observed again and again  this , in the face of 45 orders of magnitude in their luminosities and billions of years of lookback time .",
    "however , upon comparison of the c  iv emission line flux to that of the underlying continuum flux density @xmath12 , jack discovered that this ratio is in inverse proportion to the monochromatic ultraviolet continuum luminosity @xmath13 ( baldwin 1977 ) .",
    "@xmath14 this effect is illustrated dramatically , though qualitatively , in figure  1 .",
    "if calibrated , a measurement of a quasar s c  iv equivalent width would indicate its luminosity and thus its luminosity distance .    since baldwin s initial discovery , several studies have found similar relationships for uv emission lines in addition to c  iv , and that each emission line has its own logarithmic slope in the @xmath15 relation , perhaps offering clues to its origin ( baldwin , wampler , & gaskell 1989 ; kinney , rivolo , & koratkar 1990 ; zamorani et al .",
    "1992 ; espey , lanzetta , & turnshek 1993 ; osmer , porter , & green 1994 ; laor et al .",
    "1995 ; zheng , kriss , & davidson 1995 ; turnshek 1997 ) .",
    "kinney et al .  ( 1990 ) also showed that the baldwin effect extends down to seyfert nuclei luminosities .",
    "unfortunately , many of these same studies also demonstrated the existence of substantial intrinsic scatter in the relations .",
    "thus , the use of quasars as `` beacons of cosmic history '' via the baldwin effect would have to await some understanding of quasar spectra .",
    "a number of other important quasar spectral correlations have been amassed since baldwin s discovery in 1977 and these may provide clues to the latter s origin .",
    "quasars are intrinsically luminous x - ray sources .",
    "a number of quasar x - ray emission studies have found a relationship between the uv / x - ray continuum flux ratio @xmath16 and the uv continuum luminosity @xmath13 , in that higher luminosity quasars have characteristically steeper effective logarithmic uv to x - ray spectral slopes @xmath17 ( 2500    2 kev ) and @xmath18 ( 1350    1 kev ) ( zamorani et al .  1981 ; wilkes et al .  1994 ;",
    "wang , lu , & zhau 1998 ) .",
    "the wilkes et al .",
    "( 1994 ) relation is @xmath19 this relation extends down to the luminosities of seyfert nuclei .",
    "it should be noted that the significance of this relationship is a subject of debate ( lafranca , franceschini , & vio 1995 ; avni , worrall , & morgan 1995 ; yuan , siebert , & brinkmann 1998 ) .",
    "line ratios sensitive to the ionizing continuum sed , e.g. , ly@xmath7/c  iv and ly@xmath7/o  vi , and the equivalent widths of these three emission lines all correlate with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this is an expected result based upon energetics arguments _ if _ @xmath17 and @xmath18 are proxies for the actual ionizing continuum seds of quasars ( netzer , laor , & gondhalekar 1992 ; zheng et al .",
    "1995 ; green 1996 ; wang et al .",
    "1998 ) . as explained above these line ratios",
    "reflect the energy balance of the gas and thus broadly measure the average ionizing photon energy of the incident continuum .",
    "relationships between @xmath13 and these line ratios and the line equivalent widths were also found in these studies .    taken together",
    ", these correlations would indicate a general relationship between the quasar s ionizing sed and its observed ultraviolet luminosity , and this may play a major role in the origin of the baldwin effect .",
    "the emission lines of quasars arise mainly or exclusively via the photoionization of gas , in the so - called broad line region , surrounding a uv / x - ray ionizing continuum source .",
    "early successful photoionization models of emission from single clouds are described in the works of davidson & netzer ( 1979 ) and kwan & krolik ( 1981 ) .",
    "the incident continuum sed and gas chemical abundances are the basic `` raw materials '' from which the emitted spectrum from a single cloud arises . for a given set of raw materials , the ionizing photon flux , the gas density , and _ especially _ the ratio of these two parameters  proportional to the ionization parameter @xmath20  set the spectrum . the gas column density and details concerning the radiation transfer place the final touches on the emitted spectrum .",
    "the early models found that there was a preferred value of @xmath21 , though a separate population of gas with a larger value must also exist to account for the observed strength of the o  vi @xmath81034 line .",
    "the work of many observational spectroscopists of the late 1970s and early 1980s demonstrated the homogeneous nature of the emission line spectra of quasars and their lower luminosity cousins , seyfert nuclei .",
    "nature must somehow know to adjust the ionization parameter knob to the nearly the same value through 5 decades in luminosity and 10 billion years of lookback time .    from the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s , the monitoring of seyfert nuclei variability and emission line reverberation ( peterson 1993 ) demonstrated that the broad line regions lie nearer to their continuum sources than thought earlier , and contain gas with a range of particle densities to accommodate a range in ionization through a region that spans at least @xmath9  1.5 decades in radius .",
    "rees , netzer , & ferland ( 1989 ) and goad , obrien , & gondhalekar ( 1993 ) and others explored models in which the gas density and column density were unique to and allowed to vary with the distance from the ionizing photon source .",
    "however , the means by which the quasar normalizes its gas properties or why one power law of gas properties is chosen over another remained unknown .",
    "somehow , over a huge range in ionizing continuum luminosity , gas that is broadly distributed in space , particle density , and ionization is able to produce the same sets of emission lines in roughly similar ratios .",
    "what s going on ?    in the history of quasar photoionization models ,",
    "the `` single cloud '' model was followed by the `` two cloud '' model , and then a radial power law in cloud properties .",
    "recently , baldwin et al .",
    "( 1995 ) extended the `` multi - cloud '' idea to its next logical step : `` locally optimally - emitting clouds ( loc ) . ''",
    "what if nature provides the broad line regions with a large pool of gas properties , such that at every radius there exists a large range in particle and column densities ? under these conditions the emitted spectrum is controlled by powerful _ selection effects",
    "_ introduced by the atomic physics and basic radiative transfer effects .",
    "see figure  2 and korista , baldwin , & ferland ( 1997 ) .",
    "gas having properties that make it most efficient in reprocessing the continuum into a particular line will emit most of that line s luminosity .",
    "the gas need not fill the entire @xmath22 plane in figure  2 , but unless the gas in the blr has a remarkably restricted range of properties , we will in fact observe the optimally emitting gas for most lines . and just as important , such an ensemble spectrum reproduces a typical quasar spectrum .",
    "the loc model suggests that at work is a loose analog of darwin s natural selection and it offers natural explanations for : ( 1 ) the observed homogeneity of the quasar spectra and the `` magic ionization parameter '' problem , and ( 2 ) the ionization stratification inferred from observations .",
    "another important consequence of this idea is that to a good approximation we can take a `` statistical mechanics '' approach to the modelling of quasar spectra , concerning ourselves with the ensemble emission , rather than with the details of the properties and arrangement of the individual gas clouds . in this picture",
    "the continuum sed and gas chemical abundances are the major drivers of the emission line spectrum , not a magic ionization parameter . in this case we can hope to learn about these two fundamental parameters and the possible stories they can tell concerning cosmic history and the nature of quasars .    a word of caution should appear here .",
    "the emission line spectrum from gas distributed in particle density and radius is in general much less sensitive to changes in the gas abundances and continuum sed than that emitted by a single `` cloud '' of fixed particle density and ionization parameter .",
    "this is because that as a cloud s thermodynamics adjusts to changes in the sed or gas abundances , its reprocessing efficiency can change immensely . in _ any _ distributed cloud model",
    ", there will be other clouds with other properties at similar distances from the ionizing source that will also react , and the integrated response is dampened . under the distributed cloud hypothesis ,",
    "the emitted spectrum does remain sensitive to the continuum sed and gas abundances , and this sensitivity will probably better represent nature .",
    "i use the spectral synthesis code , cloudy ( 90.04 ; ferland et al .",
    "1998 ) , and the emission from an ensemble of plane - parallel clouds under the assumption of the loc model to demonstrate that a characteristic dependence of the continuum sed and gas abundances on the quasar luminosity may provide an explanation for the baldwin effect . for simplicity and because of the spectrum s general insensitivity to it , i held the column density fixed at @xmath23 .",
    "see korista , baldwin , & ferland ( 1998 ) for details .      for reasons of simplicity",
    "and because we do not know what ionizing continuum sed is incident upon the broad line emitting gas , i will demonstrate the effects of a changing continuum sed on the gas emission using simple power laws , their spectral indeces @xmath7 ranging from @xmath24 to @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "panel ( b ) of figure  3 shows how the equivalent widths ( here , always measured with respect to the continuum at 1215   ) of 5 prominent quasar emission lines vary with the power law index .",
    "the gas abundances were fixed to roughly solar values in all cases .",
    "the emission line equivalent widths ( @xmath27 ) all diminish with the softening in the continuum .",
    "this is simply a result of conservation of energy  fewer high energy ionizing photons and the resulting lower gas temperatures produce weaker lines relative to the _ non - ionizing _ uv continuum at 1215   .",
    "panel ( d ) of figure  3 shows that ratios ly@xmath7/o  vi and ly@xmath7/c  iv are highly sensitive to the continuum sed , but that n  v / he  ii and especially n  v / c  iv are not .",
    "other sed - insensitive line ratios are @xmath81900  blend / c  iv , @xmath81400  blend / c  iv , and n  iii  990/c  iii  977 .",
    "figure  4 compares our simulations for fixed gas abundances to the observations of ly@xmath7/o  vi ( zheng et al .",
    "1995 ) and ly@xmath7/c  iv ( wang et al .  1998 ) .",
    "the observational points used measurements of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , while of course the simulations have assumed a simple power law with index @xmath7 .",
    "the correspondence is good and demonstrates that the observed @xmath17 and @xmath18 must stand as reasonably good proxies for the true ionizing continuum sed .",
    "zheng & malkan ( 1993 ) proposed that the baldwin effect could be explained via the combined effect of a strengthening non - ionizing uv continuum and weakening ionizing continuum with luminosity .",
    "that the higher ionization lines in figure  3b have steeper @xmath27 dependencies on the spectral index is a reflection of these two effects , and is generally consistent with the trends in the measured slopes of the baldwin effects of various emission lines ( espey et al .  1993",
    "; espey , these proceedings ) .",
    "a sed@xmath13 relationship might be driving the baldwin effect , but it can not be the whole story .",
    "when the @xmath27(n  v ) is measured it has little or no dependence upon luminosity ( espey et al .",
    "1993 ; osmer et al .  1994 ; laor et al .",
    "figure  1 illustrates this further .",
    "panels ( b ) and ( d ) of figure  3 predict that n  v / c  iv should be luminosity independent , i.e. , n  v should show a baldwin effect as strong as c  iv .",
    "hamann & ferland ( 1993 ) showed that larger values of n  v / c  iv and n  iv / he  ii are systematically found at larger quasar luminosities .",
    "this must mean that the continuum shape is not the only parameter .      here",
    "i will demonstrate the effects of a changing gas metallicity , @xmath0 , for a fixed continuum sed ( @xmath28 ) . in a simple scheme to change the metallicity i assumed that the metal abundances relative to hydrogen scale from their solar values as @xmath0 .",
    "however , nitrogen is expected to be selectively enhanced by `` secondary '' cno processing in stellar populations ( at least when z exceeds a few - tenths solar ) , and so in these simulations @xmath29 while @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( hamann & ferland 1993 ; vila - costas & edmunds 1993 ; van zee , salzer , & haynes 1998 ) . as such",
    ", nitrogen lines are valuable tracers of the gas chemical enrichment ( ferland et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in panel ( a ) of figure  3",
    "i show how the equivalent widths of the same five emission lines vary with the metallicity .",
    "the strengths of ly@xmath7 and especially he  ii diminish with the increasing metal opacity . in as far as hydrogen and helium are still the major opacity sources , their ionized volumes diminish with increasing @xmath0 due to the increased numbers of electron donors . for @xmath32 , the strengths of c  iv and o  vi both diminish as the gas cools and the cooling shifts to other lines .",
    "however , since n  v is initially a weak line and because the n / h abundance ratio is proportional to @xmath33 , @xmath27(n  v ) @xmath34 ! other initially weak lines are generally correlated to a lesser extent with metallicity . however , those lines that are formed near the front of the cloud ( e.g. , o  iv ] 1402 ) remain roughly constant with @xmath0 .",
    "the temperatures here scale strongly with @xmath0 ( i.e. , cooler with increasing @xmath0 ) and the he@xmath35 zone where these lines form is diminshed in volume . in panel",

    "vi and ly@xmath7/c  iv are relatively insensitive to the gas metallicity . however , the n  v / he  ii and n  v / c  iv ratios are roughly linear in @xmath0 .",
    "we also find the following rough dependencies on metallicity : @xmath81900/c  iv @xmath36 , n  iii  990/c  iii  977 @xmath34 , and @xmath81400/c  iv @xmath37 .",
    "it is worth noting that the same line ratios that are insensitive to the continuum sed are sensitive to @xmath0 , and those sensitive to the continuum sed are insensitive to @xmath0 . while the relationship is not always simple , this dichotomy of emission line ratio properties is not a coincidence , and may prove to be a powerful tool in disentangling the effects of these two fundamental parameters on the quasar spectrum .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure  3 suggest a solution to the n  v conundrum . if , characteristically , the gas metallicity increases ( with n / h @xmath38 ) while the continuum sed softens with increasing luminosity , the @xmath27(n  v )",

    "_ the rapid turn on of quasars was the result of massive galaxy formation , during which the action of merging halos ( press & schecter 1974 ) both created and drove gas into supermassive black holes ( haehnelt , natarajan , & rees 1998 ; miller & percival 1998 ) . masses of the nuclear black holes , @xmath1 , correlated with masses of forming galaxies or their dark halo masses ( haehnelt et al .",
    "more massive galaxies , with their deeper central gravitational wells , were better able to retain gas deposited during stellar evolution than were lower mass galaxies , so they had a more rapid buildup of the heavy elements in their nuclear regions ( hamann & ferland 1993 ; 1999 ) .",
    "the most massive black holes likely produced the most luminous quasars , _ initially _ , since quasars turned on near or above their eddington limits : @xmath50 .",
    "these most luminous quasars thus required the largest mass accretion rates , @xmath2 , to sustain their luminosities .",
    "while we are far from understanding the mechanisms that generate the quasar continua ( see antonucci 1988 ; 1998 ) , the standard accretion models predict softer uv bumps for larger @xmath1 at a fixed @xmath51 ( laor & netzer 1989 ; sincell & krolik 1998 ) , and the current corona ",
    "accretion disk models predict larger uv to x - ray continuum flux ratios for larger values of @xmath3 ( czerny , witt , & @xmath52ycki 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , more luminous quasars might be expected to have typically softer continuum seds ( e.g. , steeper @xmath17 ) . with the largest required mass accretion rates ,",
    "the most massive and luminous quasars are expected to have the shortest lifetimes ( like massive stars ) , as the limited `` fuel '' supply is exhausted .",
    "the fuel exhaustion process is not well understood , but there are some ideas . at sufficient luminosities",
    "relative to the disk binding energy , a `` back reaction '' may occur , choking off the matter accretion significantly ( haehnelt et al .",
    "furthermore , the self - similar infall solutions of bertschinger ( 1985 ) and the press - schecter theory of the collapse of dark matter halos ( 1974 ) both predict a decline in the mass accretion rate with time .",
    "even if @xmath2 were to remain constant , the ratio @xmath3 must evolve to smaller values due to accretion alone .",
    "thus the evolution of an accreting black hole quite naturally leads to a drop in @xmath3 with time ( see also haiman & menou 1998 ) .",
    "once @xmath3 drops below a critical value , the accretion flow radiation efficiency is expected to drop to values @xmath53 , and an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) may result ( narayan & yi 1995 ) . in this mode , the uv to x - ray continuum luminosities are expected to be more comparable .",
    "thus , as @xmath3 in individual quasars diminished with time , evolution to lower luminosities and harder continuum seds ( e.g. , flatter @xmath17 ) likely resulted ( caditz , petrosian , & wandel 1991 ; yi 1996 ; haehnelt et al .",

    "the initial nuclear gas metallicity would be characteristically smaller in the shallower potential wells of the lower mass black holes .",
    "further evolution to smaller values in @xmath0 might have occurred in quasars of any mass due to dilution by lower @xmath0 gas falling into the nuclear regions over the life of the galaxy ( hamann & ferland 1993 ) .",
    "later epoch galaxy mergers could rekindle the nuclear fires and again enrich the gas , temporarily extending the quasar epoch .",
    "but in a maturing and expanding universe , galaxy merger rates slowed , and eventually all quasars died .",
    "remaining are the seyfert nuclei with their typically smaller @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , lying within the centers of more modest galaxies , whose nuclear gas metallicities are within a factor of 2 of solar . also present are the more massive , yet generally dormant , black holes in the nuclei of present - day giant elliptical and other galaxies ( margorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the above picture is presently sketchy at best , and may be completely wrong .",
    "key uncertainties are : the lives of quasars and their energy dissipation mechanism(s ) , galaxy formation and its relation to the births of the quasars . if this picture has any validity it is easy to see why the baldwin effect has been such a hard nut to crack .",
    "different initial conditions and times of massive galaxy formation resulted in separate quasar populations , characterized by @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath0 , co - evolving in time .",
    "this scenario suggests that these four parameters are fundamental to the quasar in driving its continuum and emission line spectra .",
    "osmer , porter , & green ( 1994 ) demonstrated that the baldwin effect is seen globally across all redshifts _ and _ within narrow redshift intervals .",
    "this would argue for the study of carefully selected samples of quasars at many redshift or lookback time intervals .",
    "further sources of intrinsic scatter in any continuum ",
    "emission line correlations can arise from geometry  orientation effects due to possible anisotropies in the line and continuum emission ( netzer 1987 ; netzer et al .",
    "1992 ) , as well as short time scale continuum  emission line reverberation ( kinney et al .  1990 ; pogge & peterson 1992 ; shields , ferland , & peterson 1995 )",
    ". the latter should be less important for the higher luminosity quasars . these and other nuisances should `` average out '' in large samples of objects  and perhaps the luminosity distances can be recovered through a process analogous to `` main sequence fitting '' of stellar clusters , as suggested by jack baldwin at this meeting . for a thorough discussion of these issues ,",
    "see the conference proceedings contribution of osmer & shields .",
    "while the jury is still out as to whether the baldwin effect in quasar spectra can ever be used as a standard luminosity candle , it may be telling us about the workings of the quasar central engine , the gas enrichment in the nuclei of massive galaxies , and possibly about the evolution of massive galaxies themselves .",
    "jack baldwin and gary ferland are my collaborators in the work presented here .",
    "i also acknowledge helpful discussions with fred hamann and joe shields .",
    "i am grateful to the baldwin family for their gracious hospitality during my two week stay in la serena ."
