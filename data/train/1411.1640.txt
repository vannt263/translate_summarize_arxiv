    "the fragmentation of a local overdensity ( a `` cloud '' ) in a continuum is one of the fundamental problems in astrophysics , as it underlies the formation of galaxy and star clusters . over sixty years ago , @xcite proposed a model in which stars form in a fragmentation process _ during _ the collapse of a nearly isothermal spherical cloud , based on the fact that the jeans mass in an isothermal medium decreases as the density increases .",
    "hoyle s mechanism was subsequently laid on firmer mathematical grounds by @xcite .",
    "this point of view prevailed until it was realized by @xcite that the small - scale density fluctuations within a cloud whose initial mass is close to the jeans mass could not grow faster than the cloud itself , because when thermal pressure is non - negligible , it acts to slow down the collapse of smaller - scales compared to the larger scales . since then , it has been generally accepted that molecular clouds ( mcs ) do not fragment by a hoyle - like mechanism , and other mechanisms , such as turbulent fragmentation might be at work .",
    "however , recent numerical studies suggest that cold , dense clouds in the interstellar medium ( ism ) can form by intermediate- to large - scale converging flows in the warm atomic medium , which are capable of coherently triggering a phase transition to the cold atomic phase over large regions in the gas .",
    "this large - scale coherence implies that the clouds can form already containing a large number of jeans masses @xcite .",
    "therefore , the crucial assumption made by @xcite , that the cloud s mass is near the jeans mass , is not necessarily fulfilled in collapsing mcs , thus making it relevant to again consider the collapse of small - scale fluctuations within a larger - scale object which is itself collapsing , for the fragmentation of mcs .",
    "the analysis of the collapse of density structures embedded within larger ones that are also undergoing collapse may benefit from the tools developed for studying the evolution of linear fluctuations in the cosmological flow of dark matter . in this case",
    ", it is standard to consider a pressureless , expanding hubble flow , in which small - amplitude density enhancements at a certain scale @xmath3 begin to retard their expansion , until they eventually begin to collapse , at which point , they are said to `` separate '' from the global expansion .",
    "it is well known that , in this case , the collapse of these regions proceeds more slowly ( as a power - law in time ) than that of a fluctuation in a non - expanding medium ( which grows exponentially ) , because the global expansion counteracts the global collapse .",
    "now , if being embedded in an expanding ( regular hubble ) flow reduces the growth rate of the large - scale fluctuation , it is natural to expect that being embedded in a _ contracting _ ( inverse hubble ) flow should _ enhance _ the growth rate of the fluctuations located inside the collapsing large - scale structure .",
    "this could be thought of as an inescapable form of nonlinearity , in the sense that the growth of one mode is linked to that of another mode , since the growth of a small - scale fluctuation depends on its being located within a larger - scale one , an effect that will be active even when the small - scale fluctuation has a small ( linear ) amplitude .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate this possibility , using a linear perturbation analysis to study the growth of density fluctuations located inside a larger - scale spherical fluctuation undergoing free - fall collapse as well .",
    "because , as dicussed above , the mc case may be adequately described by means of a nearly pressureless regime , while the dark matter is intrinsically so , we consider a pressureless regime here .",
    "the solution for the density perturbation growth is then compared to that of the classical jeans case for a static background , to show that the initially linear density perturbations grow at a faster rate inside a collapsing spherical cloud .",
    "in what follows , we will consider the collapse of a _ spherical _ cloud , embedded in a medium that is itself collapsing .",
    "although mcs in particular are known to strongly depart from a spherical symmetry , and the collapse times for non - spherical clouds are known to be longer than the standard free - fall time , which assumes this geometry @xcite , the study of the spherical case will allow us to compare with this standard timescale .",
    "the collapse of a spherical cloud can be described using the standard machinery applied for a contracting universe , noting that the physical differences lie in the definition of the hubble parameter @xmath4 . in both cases",
    "this can be written as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a suitable scale factor .",
    "for the cosmological case , @xmath7 is simply the well - known scale factor , while for a spherical mc , @xmath7 can be defined as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the initial cloud s radius . in both the mc and the cosmological cases , @xmath6 satifies friedmann s equation ( see appendix a for the mc case ) @xmath10 the case of a collapsing spherical cloud is mathematically equivalent to the second half of the evolution of a closed ( @xmath11 ) , matter - dominated universe that frst expands to a certain maximum scale factor and then recollapses .",
    "so , in what follows , we will consider that the origin of the time coordinate is the point of maximum expansion of such closed universe .",
    "note that , during this contracting phase , @xmath12 .",
    "the standard linear stability analysis for the growth of density fluctuations in the case of an expanding ( or contracting ) universe starts from the linearized equations of continuity and momentum conservation , together with the poisson equation , which read @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the sound speed , @xmath15 denotes the position vector , and the variables ( generically denoted @xmath16 ) have been decomposed as @xmath17 , the subindex `` 0 '' denoting the unperturbed quantities , and the subindex `` 1 '' denoting the corresponding ( small ) fluctuation .",
    "the unperturbed quantities include the background expansion ( or contraction ) : @xmath18 where @xmath6 is the scale factor , obeying the friedmann equation , eq.([eq : friedmann ] ) .",
    "as is well known , for scales much larger than the jeans scale , that is , neglecting the pressure term , the equation for the perturbation growth is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the relative density fluctuation .",
    "a general solution to eq.([eq : deltas ] ) can be written as @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are constants .    to find the solution ,",
    "a parameterization is usually proposed in which both the scale factor @xmath7 and time @xmath24 are functions of a parameter @xmath25 .",
    "a usual parameterization is @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath28 $ ] @xcite . in figure",

    "this case has been studied by @xcite , who found the solution for @xmath30 as a function of @xmath25 as @xmath31 + b \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{(1-\\cos\\theta)^{2 } } , \\label{eq : delta1}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are constants , which can be evaluated using the initial conditions as follows .",
    "we note that     and scale factor @xmath7 as a function of @xmath25 for the collapsing part ( @xmath34 $ ] ) of the closed matter - dominated universe . ]",
    "@xmath35    and @xmath36 for @xmath37 , the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta1 ] ) is positive but monotonically decreasing in the interval @xmath38 , approaching @xmath39 as @xmath40 , and becoming zero at @xmath41 . for @xmath42 ,",
    "the sings are reversed , but the divergence of this term as @xmath43 persists . for @xmath44 , it approaches @xmath45 as @xmath46 . on the other hand , the first term in the right - hand side of eq.([eq : delta1 ] )",
    "is zero at @xmath47 .",
    "this implies that the full solution with @xmath48 diverges there . for the cosmological case , which starts contracting at @xmath41 , but must have previously undergone an expanding stage ( @xmath38 ) , we must require that @xmath49 as @xmath40 ( the big bang ) , and thus we must take @xmath50 .",
    "the constant @xmath32 is determined by eq.([eq : a ] ) , which gives @xmath51 . defining @xmath52 , we can then write the evolution equation for the cosmological case as @xmath53 , \\label{eq : delta_ihf_cos}\\ ] ] together with the initial condition , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ab ] ) , @xmath54 where we have defined @xmath55 .",
    "on the other hand , for the molecular cloud case , for which there is no constraint that our initial state ( @xmath41 ) be the continuation of a previous expanding stage , we have no boundary condition applicable at @xmath56 , and thus no reason to set @xmath50 . in this case , a reasonable limiting initial condition is to set @xmath57 at @xmath41 , meaning that the fluctuation starts growing from rest . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ab ] ) , this implies @xmath58 , and thus the evolution equation for the perturbation becomes @xmath59 + \\frac{3\\pi \\delta_{0}}{2}\\frac{\\sin\\theta}{(1-\\cos\\theta)^{2 } } , \\label{eq : delta_ihf_mc}\\ ] ] with the initial condition @xmath60 the solution starting from this initial condition should be considered as describing the minimum possible growth rate of the density fluctuation . in reality",
    ", the buildup of the fluctuation will imply that at the initial time its growth rate is moderate but larger than zero .",
    "however , since there is no criterion to decide the initial growth rate , we consider the case of zero rate as the lower limit to the possible realistic rates , and so the evolution of actual fluctuations should be considered to be bounded from below by this case .",
    "equations ( [ eq : delta_ihf_cos ] ) and ( [ eq : delta_ihf_mc ] ) , with the corresponding initial conditions given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : abbis ] ) and ( [ eq : abtris ] ) , describe the evolution of a density fluctuation in a contracting background , in the cosmological and molecular cloud subcases , respectively . in general",
    ", we will refer to the situation of a contracting background , as an inverse hubble flow ( ihf ) .",
    "finally , we note that the collapsing background ( assumed spherical ) for either ihf case completes its collapse on its free - fall time , which is given by    @xmath61    because at @xmath62 the scale factor of the background @xmath7 has shrunk to zero , @xmath63 corresponds to @xmath64 . on the other hand , we consider that the evolution starts when @xmath65 , that is , at the onset of the contracting stage .",
    "thus , relation ( [ eq : t - theta ] ) can be written as the equality @xmath66      in this next section , we will compare the evolution of the fluctuations in an ihf to the evolution of the classical jeans case , applicable to a static background .",
    "for this case , it is well known that the general solution is @xmath67 where the characteristic timescale @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 and @xmath70 and @xmath71 are coefficients to be determined as follows .",
    "first , we note that , to compare to the cosmological ihf case , the simplest choice is @xmath72 and @xmath73 , since we then have @xmath74 this can be compared to the initial growth rate for the cosmological ihf case which , writing eq .  ( [ eq : abbis ] ) in terms of the time variable , is @xmath75 and so the two initial growth rates are nearly the same .",
    "on the other hand , in order to compare to the molecular - cloud ihf solution , a useful choice is @xmath76 , since in this case the initial growth rate for the jeans solution is zero , in agreement with the initial condition for the molecular - cloud ihf solution .",

    "note that these expressions contain an explicit dependence on the initial density perturbation @xmath79 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : deltas ] , we plot the two ihf solutions , eqs.([eq : delta_ihf_cos ] ) and ( [ eq : delta_ihf_mc ] ) ( black and red solid lines , respectively ) as a function of time , together with the jeans solution with either finite ( @xmath80 , @xmath78 ) or zero ( @xmath81 ) initial growth rate ( black and red dashed lines , respectively ) .",
    "the timescale for all cases is normalized to the free - fall time , @xmath63 , and all solutions are normalized to the initial fluctuation amplitude , @xmath79 . from figure",
    "[ fig : deltas ] , the linear growth of the normalized density fluctuation is seen to be faster in the ihf case*s * than in the jeans case .",
    "moreover , the fact that @xmath30 increases monotonically with time means that the density of the perturbation increases faster than that of the collapsing background .",
    "however , note that , for the linear ihf solutions , the fluctuation terminates its collapse at the same time as the background , since , from eqs .",

    "the time for the density fluctuation to grow by a factor of @xmath89 ( i.e. , the time to reach nonlinearity , or @xmath90 ) in the cosmological ihf case and the corresponding jeans case is @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively , as shown by the black solid and dashed lines , respectively . for the molecular cloud case and its correponding jeans case with zero initial growth rate ( red solid and dashed lines , respectively ) , these times are @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively . in general , this figure shows that , the smaller the initial amplitude , the larger the ratio of the jeans to the ihf growth times .",
    "more fundamentally , the linear growth time in the jeans case increases without limit as @xmath95 decreases , while it remains finite , asymptotically approaching the free - fall time for the ihf cases .",
    "again , this is a manifestation of the inherent nonlinearity of the situation when a small - scale perturbation is growing within a larger - scale one that is also growing .     for the perturbation to grow to @xmath87 in both the jeans ( dashed lines ) and the ihf ( solid lines ) cases , _ versus _ the initial fluctuation amplitude , @xmath95 .",
    "as in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltas ] , the black lines denote the cosmological case , and the red lines denote the molecular cloud case . ]",
    "the results from the previous section have a number of important implications for the evolution of density fluctuations within collapsing mcs .",
    "first and foremost , our results imply that the standard notion that , in the linear regime , all fluctuations grow at the same rate , is not entirely accurate .",
    "small - scale fluctuations embedded in a larger - scale fluctuation that is also collapsing will grow faster than isolated fluctuations .",
    "the fact that this feature has not been recognized before can be traced to the common practice of discussing purely in terms of fourier spectra , neglecting the _ phases _ of the fourier modes , which are the part related to the spatial distribution of the density field @xcite . in",
    "* our * case , it is seen that the spatial location introduces a fundamental modification to the picture .",
    "this coupling between a small and a large scale is inevitable even in the linear regime , and arises from the fact that the large - scale fluctuation embedding the small - scale one constitutes a background which modifies the governing equations , even in the linear analysis .    in the case of structure formation within the expanding cosmological flow",
    ", it is well known that all density fluctuations are initially part of the expanding universe , and therefore , although their corresponding density fluctuation @xmath30 is increasing monotonically , their physical size is still increasing as a consequence of the expansion , albeit at a lower rate than the global one . at some time , usually referred to as the _ turnaround point _ , they finally stop expanding and begin to contract , but by this time they are already nonlinear with respect to the universal hubble flow .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the _ linear _ growth of a small - scale fluctuation embedded within a larger - scale one will occur while the latter is still expanding , even if its corresponding @xmath30 is increasing . in this case , the small - scale fluctuation will nevertheless find itself embedded in a background that is expanding more slowly that the global expansion , and so its growth will be faster than that of a fluctuation growing in the global expansion field , causing an earlier collapse anyway .",
    "we hope to investigate this in future work .",
    "in fact , it is possible that the accelerated growth of density fluctuations embedded in growing density fluctuations may have already been observed in numerical simulations of halo and galaxy formation , but not recognized as a consequence of this effect .",
    "indeed , the numerical study of the environmental dependence of halo formation by @xcite found evidence that _ halos of a given mass forming in high density environments typically form earlier than those formed in low density environments_. this result has been subsequently confirmed by other authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , some of which use a different measure of the environment s overdensity .",
    "we suggest that this result may be a consequence of the halo being located in an overdense region which is itself growing , therefore , it grows faster than otherwise .    in the mc context ,",
    "our results have also relevant implications .",
    "first , if the formation mechanism of mcs is such that they quickly acquire many jeans masses , then their collapse is nearly pressureless , and then even moderately linear perturbations , with @xmath96 can grow faster than the global collapse , as systematically observed in those simulations .",
    "of course , this is supplemented by the facts that a ) the turbulence may produce moderately _ nonlinear _ fluctuations , which then have shorter free - fall times even from the start , and b ) that flattened or filamentary structures have longer free - fall times than spherical ones , so that spheroidal fluctuations within such structures will collapse earlier than the larger structure @xcite .",
    "but the important issue here is that , even in the worst - case scenario for fragmentation , namely that of a spherical geometry with linear density fluctuations , the perturbations are able to collapse earlier than the cloud .",
    "recent numerical simulations of mc formation and evolution have shown that the clouds engage in global gravitational collapse , and that the density fluctuations within them grow and complete their local collapse before the global collapse is completed @xcite .",
    "motivated by these results , in this paper we have performed a linear analysis of the growth rate of density fluctuations immersed in a medium that is itself undergoing global gravitational contraction . we have used the standard linear analysis used for the growth of density fluctuations in hubble flows , but considering the case of an _ inverse _ hubble flow ( ihf ) , where the background is contracting rather than expanding .",
    "we considered two variants of an ihf .",
    "the first is appropriate for a cosmological setup , in which the initial fluctuation at the onset of the collapse of the background is already growing at a finite rate , consistent with the evolution during a previous epoch of growth , during the epoch when the background was still expanding .",
    "the other is meaningful as a lower limit for a collapsing molecular cloud , in which we assume the initial growth rate to be zero .",
    "this represents a lower limit to the possible initial growth rate of the fluctuation , which is unconstrained in this case .",
    "our main results are the following :    * density fluctuations embedded in an ihf grow faster than in the standard jeans analysis ( where the background is static ) . *",
    "while in the jeans case the growth time to reach nonlinearity ( i.e. , to reach a density fluctuation amplitude @xmath97 ) increases without limit as @xmath98 , where @xmath95 is the initial value of @xmath30 , in the ihf case this growth time is bounded from above by the free - fall time of the background density , @xmath63 .",
    "this reflects the fact that the density fluctuation is embedded in a medium which is itself collapsing on a timescale @xmath63 , and the longest possible time for the fluctuation to complete its collapse is the free - fall time of the medium in which it is embedded . * for perturbations embedded in an ihf having initial amplitudes",
    "@xmath99 , the time to reach nonlinearity is @xmath100 in the cosmological variant , and @xmath101 in the molecular cloud variant . from then on ,",
    "the perturbation grows at its own free - fall rate , and therefore it will always be `` ahead '' of the global collapse .    in the context of large - scale structure formation in the universe , these results may offer an alternative ( or complementary ) explanation for the observation in numerical simulations that halos of a given mass typically form earlier in high density environments than those formed in low density environments . in the mc context , they may offer an explanation for the ubiquitous observation in numerical simulations that small - scale density fluctuations within large mcs complete their collapse ( i.e. , form stars ) before the collapse of the parent cloud is completed , even if the time difference is not too large .",
    "it must also be borne in mind that the spherical symmetry that we have assumed for the background constitutes a worst - case scenario for the possibility of fragmentation , since in this case the free - fall time depends only on the density , and is independent of size scale . instead ,",
    "for flattened or filamentary geometries , the actual collapse time is larger than the spherical free - fall time by factors that depend on the aspect ratio of the object @xcite .",
    "more fundamentally , our results show that the hierarchical nesting of the fluctuations of different scales affects the growth rate of density fluctuations , even in the linear regime .",
    "thus , our results imply that density perturbations are always able to collapse earlier than the whole cloud , as envisioned by @xcite , and recently observed in the numerical simulations , regardless of whether they have linear or nonlinear amplitudes , making hoyle - like fragmentation an inescapable process in multi - jeans - mass molecular clouds .",

    "<S> motivated by recent numerical simulations of molecular cloud ( mc ) evolution , in which the clouds engage in global gravitational contraction , and local collapse events culminate significantly earlier than the global collapse , we investigate the growth of density perturbations embedded in a collapsing background , to which we refer as an _ inverse hubble flow _ ( ihf ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use the standard procedure for the growth of perturbations in a universe that first expands ( the usual hubble flow ) and then recollapses ( the ihf ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that linear density perturbations immersed in an ihf grow faster than perturbations evolving in a static background ( the standard jeans analysis ) . </S>",
    "<S> a fundamental distinction between the two regimes is that , in the jeans case , the time @xmath0 for a density fluctuation to become nonlinear increases without limit as its initial value approaches zero , while in the ihf case @xmath1 always , where @xmath2 is the free - fall time of the background density . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this effect , although moderate , implies that small - scale density fluctuations embedded in globally - collapsing clouds must collapse earlier than their parent cloud , regardless of whether the initial amplitude of the fluctuations is moderate or strongly nonlinear , thus allowing the classical mechanism of hoyle fragmentation to operate in multi - jeans - mass mcs . </S>",
    "<S> more fundamentally , our results show that , contrary to the standard paradigm that fluctuations of all scales grow at the same rate in the linear regime , the hierarchical nesting of the fluctuations of different scales does affect their growth even in the linear stage .    </S>",
