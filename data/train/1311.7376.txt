    "studies of supersymmetric models at large coupling are rather involved and lack from satisfactory techniques to extract analytical results .",
    "exception for this is the use of ads / cft correspondence initially conjectured by maldacena @xcite but this can not be helpful for a wess - zumino model as this symmetry applies for gauge theories . on the other side ,",
    "supersymmetry is broken on the lattice and so lattice computations have not yielded useful insight so far .",
    "the problem here is to recover a meaningful limit in the continuum ( see @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "it is important to have a way to manage quantum field theories non - perturbatively as one can draw definite conclusions on all momenta ranging from infrared to ultraviolet .",
    "wild differences in the behavior of the theories in these regimes are expected .",
    "typical is the case of a yang - mills theory displayng bounded states in a non - perturbative regime but having asymtptotic freedom on the other case @xcite .    the quest for the study of non - perturbative regimes in quantum field theory has a powerful tool provided by dyson - schwinger equations .",
    "indeed , the idea to use dyson - schwinger equations for the wess - zumino model is not completely new @xcite .",
    "recently , a new way to manage these equations for the self - energies was given and exact results were provided for the computation of the anomalous dimension in ordinary and supersymmetric quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "particularly , the article @xcite has been one of the main motivations to attack the problem in the way provided in this paper .",
    "the other main reason is that the analysis by witten on the wess - zumino model @xcite does not seem to apply straightforwardly to our case with conformal symmetry and in the strong coupling limit .",
    "the reason is that , in the infrared limit , the massless theory can display a spectrum of bound states that evades witten s analysis on this model : the breaking mechanism can be different due to the presence of a zero mode @xcite .",
    "indeed , the analysis , in the conformal case and in the strong coupling limit has never been seen in literature .",
    "nobody was able to check this in real life as non - perturbative techniques are lacking .",
    "recently , we were able to provide , using techniques developed for yang - mills theory , both classical and quantum solutions @xcite .",
    "classical solutions seem to indicate that , when the coupling becomes very large , supersymmetry would be broken .",
    "it remains to be seen if quantum corrections can fix the situation .    on the other side ,",
    "an approach using dyson - schwinger equations is readily amenable to a numerical treatment .",
    "so , we are in a position to provide a fully numerical solution for the self - energies of the wess - zumino model as in @xcite the equations were fully exposed and successfully applied to the computation of the anomalous dimension in this case .",
    "but these authors made a well - definite choice for the solution of the dyson - schwinger equations starting with all self - energies being equal .",
    "this is a too strong _ ansatz _ and must be supported by the fact that the equations , also with a different choice , should drive to a solution like this .",
    "equal self - energies grant that supersymmetry is never broken .",
    "so , the main question we answer in this paper is : is there an unique choice for the self - energies of a massless wess - zumino model ?",
    "the interesting result we obtain is that the question has a negative answer .",
    "different choices with different self - energies for each involved field do not drive to the solution selected in @xcite and the question is somewhat more delicate . the paper is structured as follows . in sec.[sec1 ] we present the model and all the notational matter . in sec.[sec2 ] we yield the dyson - schwinger equations and put them into a numerical amenable form . in sec.[sec3 ] we present the numerical results .",
    "finally , in sec.[sec4 ] we give the conclusions .",
    "in all this paper the main reference is @xcite .",
    "so , in this section and the following one we take the presentation of the model and the equations we started from from that article .",
    "we do this for the sake of readers convenience .",
    "our fields are given by the massless chiral superfields @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) and their ( antichiral ) complex conjugates @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with the constarints:@xmath5 being @xmath6    each chiral superfield represents a complex scalar ( @xmath7 ) , a weyl fermion ( @xmath8 ) and a complex auxiliary field ( @xmath9 ) as it can be seen from their expansion in the @xmath10 variables , @xmath11 the lagrangian density is @xmath12 that written in terms of component fields is @xmath13 finally , we take @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "the dyson - schwinger equations for the propagators of the superfields we will work with are derived in @xcite .",
    "one has @xmath16moving to the euclidean space with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 the full propagators for fields @xmath20 and @xmath21 in ( euclidean ) momentum space , the corresponding self - energies are defined to be @xmath22 the corresponding self - energies at one - loop are @xmath23 for the auxiliary field , @xmath24 for the fermion field and @xmath25 for the scalar field in order to solve these equations and consistently with supersymmetry , in @xcite authors have chosen @xmath26 this is the key point . indeed ,",
    "doing this , the two integrals in  ( [ sigmachi ] ) combine to give @xmath27 times the right hand side of  ( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "similarly , the equation for @xmath28  ( [ sigmaa ] ) becomes @xmath29 times  ( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "the integration in ( [ sigma ] ) can be done along the same lines as in  @xcite .",
    "the angular integration uses the fact that the angular average of @xmath30 is @xmath31 and we note the fundamental identity @xmath32    with the variables @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the radiative corrections become ( @xmath35 ) @xmath36 + \\nonumber \\\\     & & \\xi(\\mu^2)-\\xi(x ) \\nonumber \\\\     \\sigma_a(x)&=&\\lambda\\int_{\\mu^2}^x\\frac{dy}{y(1-\\sigma_\\chi(y))}+{\\tilde f}(\\mu^2)-{\\tilde f}(x)+a_1(\\mu^2)-a_1(x)+a_2(\\mu^2)-a_2(x)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the renormalization condition @xmath37 and @xmath38 \\nonumber \\\\     a_1(x)&=&-\\lambda\\int_0^x dy\\frac{y}{x^2}\\left(\\frac{1}{1-\\sigma_\\chi(y)}-\\frac{1}{1-\\sigma_f(y)}\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\",
    "a_2(x)&=&-\\lambda\\int_x^\\infty\\frac{dy}{x}\\left[\\frac{2}{1-\\sigma_\\chi(y)}-\\frac{1}{1-\\sigma_f(y)}-\\frac{1}{1-\\sigma_a(y)}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is consistent with the solution proposed in @xcite eq.([eq : ansatz ] ) @xmath39 .",
    "our aim is to see , by numerically solving the above equations , if the ansatz chosen in @xcite is unique .",
    "we just note that such a choice for a solution prevents any possible breaking of supersymmetry . in any case",
    ", self - energies never get a constant value .",
    "in order to check for the uniqueness of the choice of the self - energies in @xcite we implemented numerically eq.([eq : ds ] ) with an iterative procedure . this technique is well - known and very simple to adopt . in order to verify the consistency of our approach we need to check that the final result does not depend on the choice of the first iterate and that all the procedure converges .",
    "this last control was operated by varying the number of iterations .",
    "the first step was to check the _",
    "ansatz _ of the authors in @xcite starting the iteration in the numerical code with all the self - energies assumed to have an equal functional form .",
    "the iterative procedure converges after a few steps to the proper values , as can be seen in fig.[fig : eq ] . independently on the value of the coupling , the self - energies keep on stay on identical values .",
    "we have also numerically checked that @xmath40 , being @xmath41 , settles to a constant and this is indeed the case .",
    "we observed that this result is fully independent from the choice of the first iterate in the procedure and the dyson - schwinger equations indeed settle on a solution with all equal self - energies when this ansatz is set from the start .    in order to answer the question of uniqueness we have to see what happens to dyson - schwinger equation when different values of the self - energies are chosen as first iterate deviating in this way from the original _ ansatz _ of the authors in @xcite .",
    "we performed this task and observed that in this case the solutions do not settle at all at the same value unless small couplings are considered .",
    "so , the particular choice of equal self - energies is not a generic one for the wess - zumino model .",
    "this can be seen at glance in fig.[fig : neq ]    the effect of a different choice of a first iterate introduces a constant scale factor into the computation of the self - energies independently on the way these are chosen ( if equal or not ) without any deviation from the functional form implied .",
    "it is also interesting to note the behavior of the self - energies at different couplings : for small couplings these are almost well preserving supersymmetry that appears broken at strong couplings instead , a behavior that appears to be almost generic .",
    "the numerical solution of dyson - schwinger equations for the self - energies of the wess - zumino model yields some unexpected results .",
    "these equations admit a simple solution assuming the self - energies are equal for all the fields in the model .",
    "but we have shown that this choice is not a generic one as this model gets solutions also with different choices .",
    "this could have far - reaching consequences unless a more mundane explanation is found .",
    "we hope to extend this analysis further for a better understanding of these results .",
