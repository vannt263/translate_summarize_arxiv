    "the cosmological constant problem is by far the most severe fine - tuning problem in physics . despite many interesting proposals ( see for a review ) the problem still lacks a compelling solution .",
    "recently , there has been an interesting idea in the context of the ` brane universe ' scenario that may solve part of the cosmological constant problem , namely the sensitivity of the effective low - energy cosmological constant to standard - model radiative corrections @xcite . in this proposal the standard - model fields",
    "are assumed to be localized on a 3-brane in 5 spacetime dimensions .",
    "it was argued in that special bulk - brane interactions can be chosen so that solutions with unbroken 4-dimensional poincar invariance exist independently of the standard model parameters and the 3-brane tension .",
    "the solutions found in have a naked spacetime singularity , whose resolution in a more fundamental theory of gravity was argued to play an important role in this scenario . on the other hand ,",
    "the description of the cancellation mechanism of the cosmological constant from a low - energy field theory perspective is not evident . also , it is not clear whether these ideas can be extended to eliminate the fine - tuning of bulk interactions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we describe a mechanism for relaxing the cosmological constant that incorporates some of the features of , and that addresses some of these open questions .",
    "we assume that the standard - model fields are localized on a 3-brane in 6 spacetime dimensions .",
    "we exhibit bulk solutions with the property that no locally - defined quantity away from the 3-brane is sensitive to the value of the 3-brane tension .",
    "this arises because the only effect of the 3-brane tension on the geometry is to induce a conical singularity in the transverse space with a deficit angle proportional to the brane tension .",
    "these solutions have flat induced metric on the 3-brane independent of the couplings on the 3-brane , and are therefore a natural context for the ideas of .    in order to obtain 4-dimensional gravity at long distances , the extra dimensions must be compactified .",
    "we first consider several mechanisms for non - singular compactifications that can be reliably analyzed in the context of 6-dimensional gravity .",
    "we find that none of these mechanisms preserves the property that the 4-dimensional cosmological constant is independent of the couplings on the 3-brane .",
    "we give general reasons for this .",
    "the solutions that we find generally have naked spacetime singularities at finite distance from the 3-brane .",
    "these allow new compactification mechanisms that are sensitive to physics at the 6-dimensional planck scale .",
    "we speculate that these may allow compactifications with the desired properties .",
    "we argue that such a compactification can not be parameterized purely by higher - dimension operators , suggesting that new planck - scale degrees of freedom play an important role .",
    "we then speculate on the behavior of gravity at long distances , assuming that a compactification mechanism with the desired properties can be found .",
    "if the compactification scale is @xmath1 , we argue that standard model loop contributions to the effective 4-dimensional cosmological constant are cut off at distances shorter than @xmath1 .",
    "the standard - model contribution to the cosmological constant is then of order @xmath2 , which can be small if @xmath1 is large .",
    "this model therefore realizes the ideas of .",
    "recent cosmological observations suggest that vacuum energy may be a significant fraction of the present density of the universe , as suggested by recent observations of type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "the standard - model contribution to the cosmological constant is of this order for @xmath3 mm .",
    "as is now well - known , having 2 extra dimensions of this size do not grossly conflict with observation or cosmology @xcite .",
    "more refined estimates of cosmological bounds give limits as strong as @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we will not attempt to resolve this discrepancy in the present paper , but we note that the solutions we find have a nontrivial ` warp factor ' in the bulk that can weaken the bounds .",
    "it is also interesting that extra dimensions of this size can be probed in upcoming short - distance gravity experiments and in high - energy collider experiments .",
    "it is important to remember that the scenario we are discussing is not a complete solution to the cosmological constant problem .",
    "the reason is that interactions involving bulk fields and their couplings to other branes must be adjusted to special values to obtain a solution with unbroken 4-dimensional poincar invariance .",
    "the reason that the mechanism considered here is progress is that this tuning does not involve any coupling involving the 3-brane .",
    "this means that we can hope that the required parameter relations be made natural by unbroken symmetries in the bulk , for example supersymmetry .",
    "it is interesting that these ideas provide a completely independent motivation for considering 2 large extra dimensions in the millimeter range .",
    "the original motivation came from the gauge hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "large extra dimensions can solve the gauge hierarchy problem , and for 2 extra dimensions the size of the extra dimensions must be of order @xmath5 .",
    "the fact that logarithmic potentials are natural in 2 extra dimensions gives a natural mechanism for stabilizing large extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "finally , precisely in 2 extra dimensions there is a mechanism that may explain the apparent unification of standard - model couplings near the planck scale @xcite .",
    "to describe the mechanism described above in more detail , consider a 6-dimensional metric of the form ds^2 = ^2(r ) _",
    "dx^dx^+ dr^2 + ^2(r ) d^2 , where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) parameterize the space parallel to the brane , @xmath8 is the 4-dimensional minkowski metric , and @xmath9 parameterize the transverse space .",
    "this is the most general metric with unbroken 4-dimensional poincar invariance and a translation symmetry ( @xmath10 ) in the transverse space .",
    "we assume that the variable @xmath11 is periodic with period @xmath12 , so the translation symmetry in @xmath11 is interpreted as rotation symmetry . if @xmath13 as @xmath14 , then @xmath15 corresponds to a single point in the transverse space , like the origin of polar coordinates .",
    "a 3-brane with extent along the @xmath6 directions at @xmath15 induces a conical singularity with deficit angle = 2= , where @xmath16 is the 3-brane tension and @xmath17 is the 6-dimensional planck scale .",
    "away from the brane and away from other singularities , no local quantity is sensitive to the 3-brane tension . a simple way to see",
    "this is to note that for any value of the brane tension we can rescale @xmath11 so that @xmath18 . in these coordinates , the deficit angle is parameterized by the range of @xmath11 , which can not be determined by measuring local quantities  as long as there is no other deficit angle singularities away from @xmath15 .",
    "the reason for the caveat can be understood by representing the solution with a deficit angle by a smooth metric of the form with a ` wedge ' cut out starting from @xmath15 .",
    "specifically , we consider two radial geodesics in the transverse space emerging from the 3-brane with relative angle @xmath19 , and identify points on the geodesics that are equidistant from the 3-brane . away from the brane",
    "the position of these geodesics is not measurable , since their absolute angular position is a coordinate artifact .",
    "however , if the geodesics cross , the space is compactified with spherical topology , and at the second crossing there is another conical singularity with a deficit angle proportional to the deficit angle at the original 3-brane .",
    "this must be interpreted as due to a second 3-brane , whose tension is proportional to the tension of the original 3-brane . if such singularities are not present , then there are solutions for any value of the 3-brane tension",
    ".    these solutions must be compactified . from the discussion above",
    ", we see that we do not want to compactify the solution with a second 3-brane , since that necessarily involves tuning the two 3-brane tensions against each other .",
    "one promising possibility is to end the space at a @xmath20 orbifold plane at constant @xmath21 surrounding the 3-brane at @xmath15 .",
    "another possibility is that the space is not compactified , but that the warp factor @xmath22 degreases sufficiently rapidly at large @xmath21 that gravity is effectively localized at the 3-brane .    to understand the limitations of these ideas , it is useful to compute the effective 4-dimensional cosmological constant assuming that a compactified solution has been obtained .",
    "this can be obtained by integrating the 6-dimensional action evaluated at the classical solution over the transverse space .",
    "this gives for de sitter space . ] _",
    "4,eff = t_4 - dr d ^4(r ) ( r ) , where @xmath23 is the bulk ricci scalar , @xmath24 is the bulk cosmological constant , and the ellipses denote the contribution from possible additional bulk fields or other branes .",
    "the ricci scalar evaluated at the solution can be written r = r_sing + r_bulk , where @xmath25 is proportional to @xmath26 , and @xmath27 contains the contributions from the bulk fields and other branes . precisely for the case of 2 extra dimensions ,",
    "the contribution from @xmath25 exactly cancels the contribution from the first term on the of , and we have _",
    "4,eff = -_max dr ^4(r ) ( r ) , where we have performed the ( trivial ) @xmath11 integral .",
    "in order to solve the cosmological constant problem , the integral on the of must vanish .",
    "this condition is completely independent of couplings on the brane , which is another manifestation of the independence of the brane tension discussed above .",
    "however , the vanishing of the integral above is an additional condition that in general requires fine - tuning @xcite . in the present scenario , we can hope that the vanishing of this integral can be enforced by unbroken symmetries in the bulk .",
    "for example , supersymmetry can be unbroken in the bulk , and branes away from the standard - model 3-brane may be bps states .",
    "this is natural even if supersymmetry is broken badly by fields localized on the brane , since radiative corrections of brane fields do not renormalize the couplings associated with bulk modes and distant branes .",
    "we begin by determining the metric away from the branes .",
    "the solution is a special case of the one obtained in ( see also @xcite ) , but we will derive it from first principles for completeness .",
    "we generalize the metric to allow constant curvature on the 3-brane .",
    "we parameterize the 6-dimensional metric as ds^2 = ^2 _ dx^dx^+ s ( ) d^2 + f ( ) d^2 , where @xmath28 is a metric with constant curvature @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the ` warp factor ' @xmath31 is the radial coordinate in the transverse space , while @xmath32 is an angular variable .",

    "this immediately implies s ( ) = , where a possible overall constant can be set to one by rescaling @xmath6 and @xmath31 . substituting this into the @xmath35 or @xmath34 equations gives f + 3 f = - + .",
    "the general solution is simply f ( ) = -k ^2 + + c ^-3 , where k = and @xmath37 is an arbitrary integration constant . with this solution for @xmath38 and @xmath39",
    ", one finds that the @xmath40 equations are solved ; this is a general consequence of the reparameterization invariance in @xmath21 .",
    "note that @xmath31 is dimensionless , @xmath41 , @xmath29 , and @xmath37 have mass dimension @xmath42 , and @xmath32 has mass dimension @xmath43 .",

    "the proper distance to the singularity is @xmath66 , and the time measured by an observer on the brane for a light signal to go from the brane to the singularity and back is t = 2 _ 0 ^ 1 d .",
    "this singularity is similar to the one found in .",
    "it is an interesting conjecture ( following ) that in a more fundamental theory of gravity this singularity is smoothed out in a way that preserves the independence of the solution on the 3-brane tension .",
    "for @xmath49 the region @xmath55 is also physical , although it is not possible to have a 3-brane in this region .",
    "( note that the metric depends only on @xmath67 , so the sign of @xmath31 is not physical . )",
    "this also has a naked singularity as @xmath64 ; in fact , the metric is the same near both singularities .",
    "we now turn to compactification .",
    "we first attempt to construct compactified solutions using mechanisms that we can control in the 6-dimensional gravity effective theory . we will find that these conventional mechanisms fail for very general reasons .",
    "we then turn to possible compactifications that depend on the existence of the naked singularities .",
    "we first attempt to find a compact solution with a 4-brane surrounding the 3-brane at fixed @xmath21 . in order to avoid a second deficit angle singularity , we assume that the 4-brane is at a @xmath20 orbifold boundary , which effectively ends the space .",
    "it is easy to see that there are no solutions if the 4-brane action contains only a tension term .",

    "this can not evolve in a finite distance to the solution near the 3-brane , which has @xmath70 .",
    "we now consider the possibility that there is a non - minimal stress tensor on the 4-brane of the form t _",
    "= -t_5 _ , t _ = -t_5 , _ , where @xmath71 is the induced metric on the 4-brane .",
    "this is the most general stress tensor compatible with the symmetries we are assuming .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath72 allows us to find solutions with a 3-brane surrounded by a 4-brane at finite distance , as we will see below . in the limit",
    "@xmath73 the proper separation between the 3-brane and the 4-brane becomes infinite , so the mechanism that gives rise to the asymmetry is crucial for the compactification .    to cancel the standard - model contributions to the cosmological constant ,",
    "it is important that the mechanism that gives rise to the asymmetry does not bring in dependence on the 3-brane tension via the deficit angle .",
    "for example , casimir energy from fields localized on the 4-brane will give rise to a stress tensor of the form , but @xmath74 is proportional to the circumference of the 4-brane , which depends on the deficit angle at the 3-brane .",
    "similarly , a scalar field localized on the 4-brane that wraps in the @xmath11 direction must come back to its original value around the 4-brane , and hence its stress tensor also depends on the deficit angle .",
    "a more promising mechanism is to localize a 3-form gauge field on the 4-brane and assume that it has nonzero field strength f _ = e _ , e = , with all other components vanishing .",
    "this is a constant ` electric ' field in the @xmath6 directions , and is not subject to any quantization condition .",
    "the sign of the stress tensor from this configuration gives @xmath75 .",
    "we will see that this is the sign that we require to obtain a solution .",
    "the solution requires a single fine - tuning involving @xmath76 , but this fine - tuning does _ not _ involve the 3-brane tension .    nonetheless , this is not a satisfactory solution . to understand the reason ,",
    "consider adiabatically changing the 3-brane tension .",
    "this can be thought of as a crude model for a phase transition involving matter on the 3-brane .",
    "the metric then has the form with an adiabatically evolving deficit angle .",
    "as the deficit angle changes in time , the size of the 4-brane changes .",
    "this changes the value of @xmath76 , since it is the integrated number of field lines ( rather than @xmath76 ) that is conserved in the adiabatic evolution .",
    "the 4-form flux mechanism has effectively recast the cosmological constant problem as a problem of fine - tuning initial data .",
    "this phenomenon is actually a general consequence of the conservation of stress - energy . to see this ,",

    ", we construct the solutions explicitly .",
    "the main goal of this is obtain a quantitative estimate of the fine - tuning of the 4-brane tension that is required to obtain a small cosmological constant .",
    "we find that there is no improvement relative to a generic theory with new physics at the tev scale .",
    "the reader who is not interested in these details can skip to the next subsection .",
    "away from the 4-brane , the solution has the form considered in the previous section . at the 4-brane ,",
    "the metric components have discontinuous first derivatives . in terms of the metric ,",
    "the relevant terms in the einstein tensor are those with second derivatives with respect to @xmath21 .",

    "we choose the coordinate @xmath21 to increase monotonically as we pass through the 4-brane from the 3-brane position at @xmath15 .    because of the @xmath20 orbifold projection",
    ", we require the solution to be symmetric with respect to reflections about the 4-brane .",
    "this means that the bulk solution is described by the same function @xmath38 on both sides of the 4-brane .",

    "we can not hope to obtain consistent solutions , but we can see that the hoped - for effects do not occur if we treat the higher - derivative terms perturbatively . at each order in perturbation theory , we have a system of second - order equations that involves the lower - order solutions . at each order , the boundary conditions on the metric at the orbifold boundary",
    "is @xmath134 , which gives rise to a symmetric solution ( @xmath135 ) . for higher - derivative terms localized on the orbifold boundary",
    ", the same argument holds if we regulate the brane ( by a scalar domain wall ) .    if we attempt to include the higher - derivative terms non - perturbatively , the initial data at the orbifold boundary involves higher derivatives of the metric . taking asymmetric initial conditions",
    ", one can presumably find solutions of the kind we seek .",
    "however , it is difficult to interpret such solutions physically .",
    "the additional initial conditions can be thought of as additional planck - scale degrees of freedom .",
    "however , theories with higher - derivative terms are generally classically unstable , corresponding to the fact that the extra degrees of freedom are generally ghosts . at best",
    ", this line of reasoning may be viewed as a weak hint that new planck - scale degrees of freedom localized at the orbifold boundary may allow compactification .",
    "recently , there has been an interesting proposal to make sense out of naked singularities such as this by imposing boundary conditions at the singularity @xcite .",
    "while we regard this proposal as very interesting , we note that it appears to be difficult to give a generally covariant formulation of the boundary conditions for the metric ( see however ) .",
    "another interesting approach is to look for solutions that ` regulate ' the singularity by hiding it behind an event horizon @xcite .",
    "these approaches are definitely worthy of further exploration .",
    "we conclude that there are potential difficulties with the idea of compactification near the naked singularities , but the idea can not be ruled out . in light of this , we believe that the scenario described here is worth further investigation .",
    "we now turn to the effective field theory analysis of the scenario described above , assuming that compactification is possible . without a specific compactification mechanism",
    ", we can not address the details of the kaluza - klein ( kk ) spectrum or the 4-dimensional effective field theory , but we can analyze some simple aspects of the scenario that depend on the behavior near the 3-brane .",
    "we first consider the light degrees of freedom .",
    "the kk spectrum contains the 4-dimensional graviton and a massless gauge field corresponding to the unbroken rotational invariance in the transverse space .",
    "these can be parameterized by the metric ds^2 = ^2(r ) g_(x ) dx^dx^+ dr^2 + ^2(r ) ^2 , where @xmath22 and @xmath136 are as in our solution .",
    "the kk gauge field couples to momentum in the @xmath11 direction , so the standard - model fields are not ` charged ' under the gauge group .",
    "in addition , the couplings of the kk gauge field is suppressed by large volume factors and the wavefunction factor @xmath136 above .",
    "the bounds on the couplings of such a vector are therefore much weaker than the corresponding bounds on kk gravitons , which is safe .",
    "another important question we can address is whether higher - order terms on the brane upset the non - dependence of the 4-dimensional cosmological constant on the 3-brane tension .",
    "for example , we can write s_brane ~d^4 x m_6 ^ 2 .",
    "such terms can be generated by standard - model loops with external gravitational lines ; in fact , _ all _ such loop effects proportional to positive powers of @xmath17 ( the cutoff ) correspond to ultraviolet divergences , and therefore correspond to operators localized on the brane .",
    "since all such effects are equivalent to tree - level terms , this reduces the question to a classical analysis .    making sense of the equations of motion that follow from requires regulating the 3-brane , presumably taking care to preserve general covariance .",
    "however , a very general argument shows that the independence of the 4-dimensional cosmological constant of the 3-brane tension is robust against the addition of such effects .",
    "let us momentarily adopt the contrary hypothesis , namely that the absence ( or fine - tuning ) of the couplings in are required to obtain a solution with unbroken 4-dimensional poincar invariance .",
    "we should then ask what the solutions are . if we violate the fine - tuning of the couplings away from the 3-brane by a small amount , it is clear that the effect in the 4-dimensional effective field theory is a nonzero cosmological constant . the vacuum solutions in the 4-dimensional field theory are then de sitter or anti de sitter space .",
    "the 6-dimensional metric that corresponds to this solution should therefore have the symmetries of 4-dimensional de sitter or anti de sitter space ; this metric was given in , , and , where the parameter @xmath29 is the 4-dimensional curvature .",
    "this metric admits deficit angle singularities at simple zeros of @xmath38 .",
    "since these are the _ only _ solutions with the required symmetries , we conclude that all the effects of the 3-brane couplings can be absorbed into the deficit angle and the 4-dimensional curvature .",
    "( this is analogous to a ` no - hair ' theorem for codimension 2 branes . )",
    "we must still address the possibility that the 4-dimensional curvature is sensitive to the terms in .",
    "when these terms are properly regulated , their effect on physics below the scale @xmath17 can be written as boundary conditions on the gravitational fields involving higher derivatives . if the terms in can be treated as non - singular perturbations , these new boundary conditions will still allow solutions for any value of the 4-dimensional curvature , including flat space . under our assumptions",
    ", it is the matching condition at the _ other _ boundary of the transverse space that picks out the value of @xmath29 .",
    "we conclude that the presence of the terms does not invalidate our picture .",
    "this argument eliminates contributions to the effective 4-dimensional cosmological constant proportional to positive powers of @xmath17 .",
    "however , we expect loop matching corrections from loops of standard - model fields of order _ 4,eff ~. the scale of these corrections is set by @xmath1 because the size of the dominant loops in position space is of order @xmath1 . there are no contributions involving positive powers of @xmath17 because these would have to correspond to a local counterterm in the 6-dimensional theory that gives an @xmath1-dependent contribution to @xmath137 at tree level . to the effective 4-dimensional cosmological constant , which will be much larger than for large @xmath138 .",
    "however , the different kk states are nothing more than different eigenstates of momentum in the compact directions , and so such contributions correspond to contributions proportional to the cutoff @xmath17 from loops with high momentum .",
    "the argument above shows that these can not occur .",
    "the underlying reason is 6-dimensional locality , which is not manifest in a kk description .",
    "]    we can ask whether it is possible that @xmath137 could be _ smaller _ than the estimate .",
    "we believe that this is impossible , simply because of the naturalness of the effective theory at distances larger than @xmath1 .",
    "there are no massless scalars in this effective theory , and hence no light degrees of freedom that can adjust the cosmological constant to zero .",
    "we can get some insight into the mechanism for the cancellation of the standard model contribution to the cosmological constant by considering the dynamics of a slowly rolling scalar field localized on the 3-brane .",
    "the potential of the scalar acts as an effective 3-brane tension that varies with time .",
    "if the rate of change of this tension is sufficiently slow , the bulk gravitation fields will respond adiabatically .",
    "the solution will therefore have a deficit angle that tracks the instantaneous value of the scalar potential .",
    "from the point of view of the 4-dimensional effective theory , this corresponds to a mixing between the scalar and the gravity kk mode that corresponds to the deficit angle .",
    "this light mode adjusts itself to cancel the cosmological constant .",
    "we expect this mode to have a mass of order @xmath139 , and below this scale the cancellation mechanism is no longer effective ; this leads to the estimate .",
    "however , we do not understand the generation of a nonzero cosmological constant from a 6-dimensional perspective .",
    "the arguments above address only the contribution of standard - model loops to the effective cosmological constant .",
    "we emphasize again that even if one accepts the existence of a compactification with the properties described in the previous section , we do not have a complete solution to the cosmological constant problem .",
    "in particular , we have not addressed the question of bulk gravity loops , and we have seen that fine - tuning of bulk interactions is necessary to obtain a solution with unbroken 4-dimensional poincar invariance .",
    "the important point is that the quantities that must be fine - tuned do not involve the 3-brane couplings .",
    "we can therefore hope that unbroken bulk symmetries such as supersymmetry can make these parameter choices natural .",
    "we therefore believe that it is plausible that the leading contribution to the cosmological constant is of order .",
    "we have described a natural mechanism for canceling the standard - model contribution to the cosmological constant .",
    "it relies only on the properties of branes with 2 transverse dimensions .",
    "the mechanism requires the compactification scale to be in the millimeter range , and suggests a nonzero cosmological constant in the range favored by cosmology .",
    "previous work has shown that the presence of 2 large extra dimensions can also explain the gauge hierarchy problem and the unification of gauge couplings ; this confluence of ideas is nothing if not suggestive .",
    "most importantly , these ideas are testable by terrestrial experiments and cosmological observations .",
    "while we have not definitely established all aspects of the mechanism we proposed , we hope that some of these ideas will prove fruitful in the search for the ultimate solution of the cosmological constant problem .",
