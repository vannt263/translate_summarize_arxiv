    "over the last years the existence of exotic hadrons has been firmly established @xcite and now the next step is to accurately determine their structure . among the proposed configurations , the meson molecule and the tetraquark are the most often discussed .",
    "the main difference between a tetraquark and a meson molecule is that the former is compact and the interaction between the constituents occurs through color exchange forces whereas the latter is an extended object and the interaction between its constituents happens through meson exchange forces .",
    "it is also possible that the observed states are charmonium - tetraquark , charmonium - molecule or tetraquark - molecule mixtures .",
    "indeed this mixed approach has led to the best description of the @xmath1 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the mass and strong decay width were very well reproduced assuming that the @xmath1 has a @xmath2 component with a weight of 97 % and a @xmath3 component with @xmath4 % weight .",
    "as for the production in proton - proton ( pp ) collisions , both at fermilab and at the lhc , in ref . @xcite it was shown that the best description can be achieved with a charmonium - molecule combination , i.e. @xmath5 , in which the @xmath2 component is of the order of @xmath6 % . even if the best description is given by a mixture it is still very important to understand the individual role played by each component .",
    "one of the reactions which were proposed as a tool to discriminate between the two theoretical descriptions of the exotic states ( @xmath7 ) is the decay into two photons , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "this process involves particle - antiparticle annihilation , which is sensitive to the spatial configuration of the decaying states and should be hindered if its constituents are away from each other , as it is the case in a molecular configuration .",
    "in fact , for an s - wave non - relativistic two - body system @xmath7 in a state described by a wave function @xmath9 the width for annihilation into @xmath0 is given by ( r ) = |(0)|^2 [ largura ] we may expect that for a loosely bound meson molecule @xmath10 is much smaller than for a diquark - antidiquark compact system .",
    "the production of exotic particles in hadronic colliders is one of the most promising testing grounds for our ideas about the structure of the new states .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that it is difficult to produce molecules in pp collisions . in a pure molecular approach",
    "the estimated cross section for @xmath1 production is two orders of magnitude smaller than the measured one .",
    "one might try to explain these data with a pure tetraquark model .",
    "an attempt to do this , using an extension of the color evaporation model to the cases where we have double parton scattering , was presented in @xcite .",
    "an alternative is to explore the fact that ultra - relativistic hadrons are an intense source of photons ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and investigate resonance production in the @xmath0 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 = p , a ) interactions present in pp / pa / aa collisions . at large impact parameters ( @xmath13 ) , denoted hereafter ultra - peripheral collisions ( upcs ) , the photon ",
    "induced interactions become dominant with the final state being characterized by the state @xmath7 and the presence of one intact hadron , in the case of an inclusive @xmath11 interaction , or two intact hadrons if the resonance was produced in a @xmath0 or a diffractive @xmath11 interactions .",
    "recent experimental results at rhic @xcite , tevatron @xcite and lhc @xcite have demonstrated that the study of photon  induced interactions in hadronic collisions is feasible and can be used to improve our understanding of the qcd dynamics as well to probe beyond standard model physics ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this work",
    "we will systematically explore the possibility of producing exotic charmonium ( ec ) in two - photon interactions in upcs with ultra - relativistic protons and nuclei .",
    "we consider hadronic collisions at the lhc as well as in the proposed future circular collider ( fcc ) @xcite .",
    "the idea of studying exotic meson production in upcs was pioneered in @xcite , where the production cross section of several light and heavy well known mesons ( and also exotic mesons and glueballs candidates ) in nucleus - nucleus collisions was computed .",
    "later , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the same formalism was applied to the production of mesons and exotic states in proton - proton collisions .",
    "special attention was given to the exotic charmonium states @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "more recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors calculated the cross sections of the processes",
    "pp @xmath16 pn@xmath17 , where @xmath17 are the exotic charmonium states @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath14 and @xmath20 . in these reaction one",
    "proton emits one photon and the other emits a pion or a pomeron .    in this work",
    "we revisit and update the calculations performed in @xcite and @xcite , extending them to pp , pa and aa collisions at lhc and fcc energies .",
    "we shall focus on photon - photon production of the exotic charmonium states and include @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "as it will be seen , all the ingredients of the calculation are fixed with the exception of the two - photon decay width of the exotic state ( [ largura ] ) . in principle tetraquark and molecular configurations",
    "would yield quite different numbers for the decay widths , which would yield quite different production cross sections .",
    "the two - photon decay width of the exotic states has been calculated in the molecular approach in several works @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the theoretical predictions of the tetraquark model are not yet available .",
    "we are going to present production cross sections of meson molecules keeping in mind that , if the states in question were tetraquarks , the corresponding cross sections would be much larger .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present a short description of the formalism used for particle production in @xmath0 interactions at hadronic colliders . in section",
    "iii we present our predictions for the exotic charmonium production in pp / pa / aa collisions at lhc and fcc energies . finally , in section iv we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "since the theoretical treatment of upcs in relativistic heavy ion collisions has been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite , in what follows we will only review the main formulas needed to make predictions for exotic meson production in @xmath0 interactions . in the equivalent photon approximation ,",
    "the cross section for the production of a generic exotic charmonium state , @xmath17 , in upcs between two hadrons , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , is given by ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 is center - of - mass energy for the @xmath27 collision ( @xmath28 = p , a ) , @xmath29 characterizes a rapidity gap in the final state and @xmath30 is the invariant mass of the @xmath0 system .",
    "moreover , @xmath31 is the equivalent photon spectrum generated by hadron ( nucleus ) @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the cross section for the production of a state @xmath7 from two real photons with energies @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , in eq.([sec_hh ] ) , @xmath36 is the energy of the photon emitted by the hadron ( nucleus ) @xmath37 at an impact parameter , or distance , @xmath38 from @xmath28 .",
    "the photons , and their corresponding electric fields , interact at the point shown in fig .",
    "[ esquema_colisao ] .",
    "the factor @xmath39 is the absorption factor , given in what follows by @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the radius of the hadron @xmath28 ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the presence of this factor in eq .",
    "( [ sec_hh ] ) excludes the overlap between the colliding hadrons and allows to take into account only ultraperipheral collisions . remembering that the photon energies @xmath34 and @xmath35 are related to @xmath43 and the rapidity @xmath44 of the outgoing resonance @xmath7 by @xmath45 the total cross section can be expressed by ( for details see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath46 the equivalent photon flux can be expressed as follows @xmath47^{2}\\ , , \\label{fluxo}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the nuclear form factor of the equivalent photon source . in the nuclear case , it is often used in the literature a monopole form factor given by @xcite @xmath49 with @xmath50 gev . for proton projectiles ,",
    "the form factor is in general assumed to be @xcite @xmath51^{2 } \\ , .",
    "\\label{ff_pro}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in what follows we will assume these form factors to estimate the cross sections . however , as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , distinct models for @xmath48 imply that the resulting cross sections can differ significantly . in order to estimate the theoretical uncertainty associated to the model used for @xmath48 , in what follows we also will present the predictions obtained assuming @xmath52 , i.e. that proton and nucleus are point - like particles . in this case , we need to integrate from a minimum distance @xmath53 ( @xmath54 fm for protons and @xmath55 fm for nuclei ) in eq . , because the flux is divergent for @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "additionally , in the case of @xmath57 collisions , we also will consider a more realistic form factor , obtained as a fourier transform of the woods - saxon distribution for the nuclear density .",
    "as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , this form factor coincides with the monopole one only in a very limited range of values of the photon virtuality , with the difference between them becoming larger at large values of @xmath58 .        in order to estimate the @xmath59 cross section",
    "we need the @xmath60 interaction cross section as input . in what follows we will use the low formula @xcite , where the cross section for the production of the @xmath7 state due to the two - photon fusion can be written in terms of the two - photon decay width of the corresponding state as @xmath61 where the decay width @xmath62 can in some cases be taken from experiment or can be theoretically estimated .",
    "furthermore , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are , respectively , the mass and spin of the produced state .",
    "finally , it is important to emphasize that due to the @xmath65 dependence of the photon spectra , we have that for the same @xmath43 the following hierarchy is expected to be valid for the resonance production induced by @xmath0 interactions : @xmath66 .",
    "in this section we present our predictions for the production of exotic mesons due to photon - photon fusion in upcs at energies available at the lhc and proposed for the fcc .",
    "we have considered all the charmonium states for which either a measurement or a theoretical estimate of the decay width is available . for the sake of comparison with the results found in @xcite we consider the two possible assignments , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , for the states @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , in the last edition of the pdg @xcite these states still appear with undefined assignments .",
    "the masses and decay widths were inferred from refs .",
    "we use the following notation : @xmath69 denotes cross sections evaluated with @xmath70 and @xmath71 denotes cross sections evaluated with the form factors from eqs .",
    "( [ ff_nuc ] ) and ( [ ff_pro ] ) for nuclei and protons , respectively . in the particular case of @xmath57 collisions we also will present the predictions obtained using the realistic form factor @xcite , which we will denote by @xmath72",
    ". the precise form of the form factor is the main source of uncertainties in our calculations and the use of the two cases mentioned above gives us an estimate of the theoretical error .    initially let us consider the energy dependence of the total cross sections and the rapidity distributions of the resonances produced in @xmath0 interactions in upcs .",
    "these observables were shown to be the most useful ones to be compared with theoretical predictions .",
    "this expectation has been confirmed by recent experimental results ( obtained at rhic and also at the lhc ) on vector meson production ( @xmath73 , j/@xmath74 and @xmath75 ) @xcite .",
    "here we propose to extend these measurements beyond the production of well - established mesons , such as the j/@xmath74 , and use upcs in hadronic colliders to asses new information on exotic mesons and constrain theoretical predictions . in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , we present our predictions for the energy dependence of the production cross section in pb - pb collisions with @xmath26 from 100 gev to 100 tev obtained using the monopole form factors and the widths presented in table [ sig_aa ] .",
    "similar energy dependences are predicted for p - pb and p - p collisions , with the normalization scaled by a factor @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "the predicted cross sections for the lhc kinematical range are of the order of 1  100 @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , this result shows us that the cross sections are one order of magnitude larger for the energies expected to be covered by the fcc in pb - pb collisions ( @xmath79 tev ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , we show the rapidity distribution of the exotic charmonium production in pb - pb collisions at @xmath80 tev .",
    "we have that the maximum of the distribution occurs at central rapidities , strongly decreasing at forward and backward rapidities .",
    "in particular , for the @xmath15 production , the two predictions differ by a factor 3 at @xmath81 .    .cross sections for exotic meson production in pb - pb collisions using the theoretical decay rates presented in refs .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table [ sig_pp ] we present our results for the production of exotic mesons in p - p collisions at @xmath82 tev , @xmath83 tev and 100 tev . here",
    "we observe a smaller difference between the two choices of form factor when compared with the previous cases .",
    "moreover , in this case ( @xmath84 ) we do not have any enhancement of the cross section compared with the other cases , leading to much smaller cross sections .",
    "even so , these are non - negligible cross sections , of order of few pb , well within reach of present experiment detection techniques , considering the high luminosity present in pp collisions .    before concluding ,",
    "let us compare our predictions for the production of the @xmath20 and @xmath14 states in @xmath0 interactions with those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the contribution associated to @xmath11 interactions in pp collisions was estimated .",
    "we observe that the cross sections obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite are of the order of @xmath85 , while our predictions , presented in table [ sig_pp ] , are of the order of @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , the dominant channel for the production of these states are @xmath11 interactions . however , as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , they will be produced in the very forward region , with a large background associated to the pomeron exchange , which makes the experimental separation of these states a hard task .",
    "in contrast , in @xmath0 interactions , they will produced essentially at central rapidities as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , i.e. in the kinematical range covered by the current lhc detectors .",
    "in this work we have studied the production of exotic mesons in upcs at lhc and fcc energies due to two photon fusion .",
    "this is a clean process where the particles of the initial state are intact at the final state and can be detected at the forward direction as featured by the presence of two rapidity gaps between the projectiles and the produced particle .",
    "moreover , we have predicted large values for the cross sections in pbpb and ppb collisions and non - negligible values in pp collisions .",
    "our predictions for the rapidity distributions can also be of relevance for testing the theoretical models used in the calculations .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the experimental study is worth pursuing , that it can be useful to constrain decay widths evaluated theoretically and , ultimately , it can help in determining the configuration of the considered multiquark states .",
