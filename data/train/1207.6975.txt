    "the hubbard model has been widely used as a minimal model to describe strongly interacting electrons in a solid and played a particularly important role in understanding the physics related to the quantum magnetism and high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "recent experiment progress in trapping the quantum gas in optical lattice @xcite has renewed the interest in this basic model @xcite . in comparison with real materials in solid form ,",
    "the fermionic quantum gas trapped in optical lattice is a more ideal realization of the hubbard model @xcite , which provides a laboratory to simulate and study this basic quantum many - body system from different aspects .",
    "particularly current experiment techniques also prompt intensive study of quantum many - body systems in reduced one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems , among which important benchmarks include experimental realization of the tonks - girardeau ( tg ) gases @xcite , and the mott transition in 1d tight tubes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the recent experimental realization of two - component fermi gases in a quasi-1d geometry with tunable interaction strengths by feshbach resonance @xcite provides a unique possibility to experimentally study the 1d hubbard model even in the strong interaction limit .",
    "the good tunability of optical lattices enables us to experimentally elucidate the subtleties of 1d quantum many - body systems , for example , the physical properties in the strongly interacting limit .",
    "due to recent experimental progress on chromium atoms @xcite and heteronuclear polar molecule produced by stimulated raman adiabatic passage technique @xcite , dipolar atomic systems with strong long - range dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) have also attracted intensive studies @xcite .",
    "in addition , schemes of creating coulomb - like interaction in cold atom systems have also been proposed @xcite .    in the presence of long - range repulsive interaction , an interesting issue for the 1d fermionic system",
    "is the existence of wigner crystal phase @xcite . for a 1d gas of electrons with long - range coulomb interaction which has been investigated by schulz in the scheme of bosonization @xcite ,",
    "the extremely slow decay of density correlations at wave vector @xmath1 has been used as a signature of appearance of wigner crystal . here",
    "@xmath2 is the fermi wave vector with @xmath3 the particle density .",
    "after that , exploring wigner crystal phase in the short - range interacting fermion systems , for example the hubbard model , has also been carried out @xcite . by using bosonization and density matrix renormalization group methods to study the one - dimensional finite hubbard chains with hard - wall boundaries , a crossover from @xmath4- to @xmath1-density oscillations with the increasing of repulsion has been found @xcite , and sometimes the @xmath1 density oscillations was taken as a signature of the emergence of wigner crystal . in the limit of infinitely strong interaction ,",
    "the on - site repulsion imposes an effective pauli principle between fermions with different spins .",
    "consequently , the ground state in the strong repulsion limit is degenerate for states with different spin configuration @xcite , and thus the ground state density distribution of an equally mixed trapped system is identical to the fully polarized system with the appearance of the doubling of the crests in density profiles .",
    "such a phenomenon , which is also refereed as fermionization , was recently observed by the experiment in a two - particle system with tunable interaction using two fermionic @xmath5li atoms @xcite .    as the density distribution is not solely a convincing criteria of wigner crystal",
    ", the density - density correlation function plays an important role in characterizing the wigner crystal phase @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we shall study both the density distribution and density correlation function of the hubbard model either without or with long - range interactions .",
    "for the hubbard model with only the short - range interaction , we find that the density correlation function does not show any signature of wigner - crystal correlations in spite of the fact that the ground - state density profile displays pronounced @xmath1 wigner oscillations in the strong repulsion limit .",
    "to unveil the role of the interaction range , we then study the hubbard model with additional long - range interactions and compare the calculated results with those of the hubbard model .",
    "we find that the system with long - range interactions indeed exhibits quite different behaviors from those of short - range hubbard model .",
    "particularly , the clear evidence in static structure factor has indicated the important role of the long - range interaction in the formation of wigner crystal .",
    "the remain of the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we introduce our studied models and main conclusions based on the calculation of models . in sec.iii , we present our calculation results of density distributions and static structure factors in subsection a and b for the hubbard model and hubbard model with additional long - range interactions , respectively .",
    "a summary is given in the last section .",
    "the basic model describing the short - range interacting fermions in a 1d lattice is the hubbard model @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7(@xmath8 ) is the creation(annihilation ) operator of the fermion with the spin @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is the spin - up(down ) particle number operator , @xmath12 is the hopping strength which is set to the unit , and @xmath13 is the on - site interaction strength .",
    "the 1d hubbard model can be realized by trapping a two - component fermi gas in a deep 1d optical lattice .    to study the long - range interaction , we consider the following hamiltonian @xmath14 with @xmath15 the strength of the long - range interaction and @xmath16 the decaying exponent .",
    "for dipolar atoms confined in a 1d optical lattices , the dipole - dipole interaction decays as @xmath17 with the exponent @xmath18 @xcite , whereas @xmath19 corresponds to the electron system with long - range coulomb interaction . in the present work",
    ", we consider the case with repulsive on - site interaction @xmath20 and repulsive long - range interaction @xmath21 .    in the following section",
    ", we shall first calculate the density distribution and the density - density correlation function for the hubbard model ( [ eqn1 ] ) with the on - site interaction strength varying from weak to strong repulsion limit by exact diagonalization method . in order to see the oscillation of the density profile",
    ", we shall use open boundary condition ( obc ) in the calculation of density distribution , whereas periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) shall be used in the calculation of structure factor , where for the case of pbc , the distance of long - range interaction should be min@xmath22 . in the limit of @xmath23 , the total ground - state density distribution with different spin configurations",
    "is identical to that of the polarized noninteracting fermions , despite the fact that the spin - dependent densities are different .",
    "this is consistent with the exact result obtained via the exact construction of many - body wavefunction @xcite .",
    "our numerical diagonalization results also show that the structure factor , which is the fourier transformation of density - density correlation function , in the infinite repulsion limit also displays the same behavior as the fully polarized fermions .",
    "these results suggest that the appearance of the doubling of peaks of the equally mixing system ( or 4@xmath24 wigner oscillation ) in the infinite repulsion limit can not be taken as a hallmark of the emergency of wigner crystal .",
    "it is just a kind of  fermionization \" between fermions with different spins as a result of the effective pauli principle imposed by the infinite repulsion .",
    "the absence of wigner crystal phase in the short - range hubbard model implies that the long - range interaction may play a very important role in the formation of wigner crystal phase . to unveil its role",
    ", we then calculate the density distribution and the density - density correlation function for the hubbard model with the additional long - range interaction described by hamiltonian ( [ eqn2 ] ) . for conveniences",
