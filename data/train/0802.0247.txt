    "pulsar j1819 + 1305 was discovered twice , once in a swinbourne survey ( edwards  2001 ) and also in the arecibo 430-mhz survey of navarro ( 2003 , hereafter naf ) .",
    "the latter paper notes that this pulsar is the brightest of the 9 stars discovered , and using pulse - sequence ( hereafter ps ) observations they were able to identify several of its outstanding characteristics .",
    "first among these is the star s tendency to `` null '' roughly half of the time , a feature not uncommon in pulsars with a large spin - down age ( 47 myr for j1819 + 1305 ) .",
    "however , a second very strange circumstance is that the observed `` null '' intervals exhibited a strong periodicity of 53@xmath03 times the rotation period ( hereafter @xmath1 ) of 1.06 s. a 1000-period section of their observation is shown in their fig .",
    "6 , and some 18 nearly equally spaced bursts of emission are clearly evident .",
    "the figure also shows the star s asymmetric , apparently triple , profile and the text notes that a part of the intensity variation is due to `` strong intensity modulation of the first component '' .",
    "[ tab1 ]    .arecibo single - pulse polarimetry observations [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it should be noted that there are frequent variations on this basic 2-pattern picture of the emission bursts .",
    "sometimes one or other of the patterns is unusually long compared to the other .",
    "occasionally , the first pattern restarts rapidly after the second without an intervening long null sequence , leading to an unusually long emission burst .",
    "the 3-@xmath1 modulation can seem sometimes to commence while the 6-@xmath1 modulation persists in the trailing components ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] from about pulse 2340 ) . nevertheless , there appears to be a  rule \" , which must have some physical significance , that the 6.2-@xmath1 modulation is generally followed by the faster modulation , and not the reverse . in this respect ,",
    "j1819 + 1305 has much in common with b003107 , b2319 + 60 and b1918 + 19 , which also have  quantised \" subpulse drift - rates governed by succession rules ( see wright & fowler 1981 ; wright & fowler 1982 ; and hankins & wolszczan 1987 , respectively )",
    "two basic properties of j1819 + 1305 s subpulse behaviour have been established .",
    "firstly , and primarily , that the null pulses tend to bunch together and that these bunches occur on a quasi - periodic basis . secondly , that the intervening bursts of emission have two characteristic patterns such that a 6.2-@xmath1 modulation in the outer components is usually followed by a 3-@xmath1 modulation present in the first component only .",
    "both these features suggest the idea of an underlying cycle regularly repeating itself , with secular modulations superimposed on the cycle so that no two cycles are the same .",
    "a natural model which would support these properties is that of the `` carousel '' , whereby a pattern of `` beamlets '' are carried around the pulsar s magnetic axis close to its surface and are randomly sampled by the observer s line of sight .",
    "such a carousel with , say , 70% of its beamlets persistent and active would indeed generate a modulation feature reflecting its circulation time , as observed . whether or not one accepts the physical basis of this model ( and it has been modified considerably over the years , ruderman & sutherland 1975 ; wright 2003 ; gil 2006 ) , in the present context its geometry is a convenient and dynamic way of modeling the observed cyclic patterns .    in the carousel picture",
    "one naturally interprets the repetiton time of the cycle as a circulation time .",
    "this implies that the recurrent bunches of nulls are seen as regions of `` empty '' emission convected around the pole .",
    "it is then of interest to see how the observed emission bursts , with their dual modulation patterns and double cone structure , would appear in such a geometry .",
    "we have therefore constructed visual images of the conjectured carousel``polar maps '' using the cartographic transform of deshpande & rankin ( 2001)using the underlying geometry of the star , derived in  3 , and assuming the mean circulation time of 57-@xmath1 derived in  4 .",
    "the sense of the drift is taken as positive since this is the sense found in both the first and fourth components during the emission bursts .",
    "we have computed polar emission maps and movies corresponding to the several available pss , and two are shown in figure  [ fig11 ] .",
    "the left - hand display gives a polar map corresponding to an interval with relatively few `` nulls '' , whereas about half the pulses in the right - hand ps are `` nulls '' .",
    "we note that these maps correspond to only a single 57-@xmath1 circulation time , so they are necessarily more poorly sampled that those computed for stars with stable carousel configurations .",
    "there is no evidence that most of the `` beamlets '' encountered are active even over this short interval . indeed ,",
    "when `` movies '' consisting of multiple successive frames like these are viewed together , we see little evidence that particular `` beamlets '' persist for a full circulation .",
    "one can see instances in each map where the sightline traverses a given `` beamlet '' at several different angles , indicating that it persisted long enough to be tracked through both of the two outer cone components . and",
    "other passes can be seen where only weak noise - like emission was encountered .",
    "also , we can see again here the double - cone structure of the map ( and radial beamform in the lower panels ) compatible with the emission geometry worked out in  3 .",
    "figure  [ fig12 ] gives a map corresponding to that part of the long burst of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] where emission is seen across the entire profile ( pulses 2296 - 2402 ) .",
    "here we see a few fairly regularly spaced `` beamlets '' which seem to produce the bright 6.2-@xmath1 lrf feature .",
    "note that these `` beamlets '' are primarily seen in the outer conal region  and the feature is most prominent at these longitudes in the lrf  though there appears to be a weaker system in the inner cone as well .",
    "note also that a similar `` beamlet '' pattern is seen in the sub - ps of fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ( left ) , and a closer inspection indicates that some of these `` beamlets '' do persist for a couple of circulation times at this point in the overall ps , perhaps explaining why the drift feature is more prominent here .",
    "finally , we have made `` movies '' consisting of multiple frames like those seen above .",
    "we do not understand why it is that some pulsars exhibit a double conal emission configuration , nor indeed why most all conal emission has an either outer or inner conal geometry .",
    "j1819 + 1305 and other pulsars with a similar configuration provide opportunity to examine the dynamics of the emission in the two cones .",
    "that every measurable aspect of the `` beamlet '' structure in the two cones exhibits the same circulation time , drift direction , and @xmath2 strongly suggests that the emission within the respective cones is produced by the same set of emitting particles .",
    "j1819 + 1305 exhibits an asymmetrical profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) over a broad band which appears to reflect emission from both the outer and inner emission cones .",
    "thus we have classified it as having a conal quadruple ( cq ) profile despite the difficulty of distinguishing the trailing components in its profiles .",
    "profile polarimetry permits us to estimate the star s magnetic latitude @xmath3 and sightline impact angle @xmath4 as about 32  and 3.0 , respectively .",
    "@xmath5 should then be some 0.53 .",
    "though we have assumed an equatorward ( positive ) sightline traverse , no strong evidence exists to determine the sign of @xmath4 .    the pulse sequences ( ps ) of pulsar j1819 + 1305 were already known ( naf ) to exhibit `` periodic nulls '' , in which the pulsar s emission appears to switch on and off for several rotation periods with a fairly regular 50-rotation - period cycle .",
    "our fluctuation spectra over multiple observations reveal that the star s pss indeed regularly exhibit a bright and narrow low frequency feature .",
    "this striking feature permits relatively accurate measurement and is found to represent a 57@xmath01-@xmath1 period in each observation  very nearly the same interval as seen qualitatively in the `` periodic nulls '' .",
    "its positive and negative components show that it has both an amplitude and a phase - modulation character , reflecting the charactersitic patterns formed by the emission bursts which occur between the null bunches .",
    "other than their periodicity , nothing about the `` nulls '' themselves appears extraordinary .",
    "an analysis shows immediately that the populations of weak pulses and `` true '' nulls can not be fully distinguished ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "however , a careful analysis of null and burst - lengths clarified the situation : while short nulls occurred randomly ( as would typical weak pulses ) , longer nulls ( @xmath6 periods) corresponding to the periodic bunches of `` true '' nulls  were over - abundant , suggesting some underlying structural feature .    on examining the emission bursts between the null bunches we noted clear examples of subpulse drift toward increasing longitude ( positive ) at both the 6.2- and 3-@xmath1 periodicities .",
    "the interaction of these two drift patterns is subtle .",
    "the drift bands at the repetition rate of 6.2 @xmath1 traverse both the leading and trailing components .",
    "by contrast , those of 3 @xmath1 are confined to the first component and are always accompanied by strong emission in the second component together with a striking lack of emission in the third and fourth components .",
    "furthermore , the 6-@xmath1 pattern always precedes 3-@xmath1 intervals , although the 3-@xmath1 modulation sometimes begins before the 6-@xmath1 pattern expires .",
    "thus the pulsar s irregular aggregate profile is a combination of a regular four - peaked profile arising from the 6-@xmath1 modulation and the sharp two - component profile of the 3-@xmath1 modulation .",
    "the fact that there is a sequence rule between the two patterns in each burst , and therefore that emission in the trailing half of the profile ceases before that in the first naturally explains why the low frequency feature in the spectra suggests a long - term phase modulation towards the leading component .",
    "it also accounts for an observed strong anti - correlation between the leading and trailing components at a delay of around 22 @xmath1approximately half the burst length .",
    "j1819 + 1305 s regular cycle of alternating long nulls and emission bursts can be modeled geometrically as a rotating carousel with the 57-@xmath1 modulation reflecting the carousel circulation time @xmath7 , and the `` nulls '' representing sightline passes through the carousel which fail to encounter significant emission .",
    "this model therefore does not require nulls to correspond to a complete cessation of emission thoughtout the magnetosphere , merely that `` empty '' regions of the carousel circulate and maintain their identity for significantly longer than @xmath7 , giving rise to a large and obvious population of pseudo - nulls .",
    "we have argued earlier ( rankin & wright 2007 ) that the much smaller proportion of `` nulls '' in the cambridge pulsar b0834 + 06 are also pseudo - nulls , and this second type of ostensible null may be more common that heretofore realized .",
    "herfindal & rankin ( 2007a , b ) , moreover , have identified null periodicities in cambridge pulsar b1133 + 16 and several other stars .",
    "can it be , for instance , that the nulls in pulsars b1918 + 19 ( hankins & wolczszan 1987 ) and b1944 + 17 ( deich  1986 ) are also of this character ?    the carousel model , though here in essence no more than a geometric representation of the observed emission cycle , had its physical genesis in the work of ruderman & sutherland s polar gap theory ( 1975 ) . in this respect",
    "it encounters difficulty .",
    "firstly , b1819 + 1305 s @xmath7 value of 57 @xmath1 is very long compared to that expected in polar gap theory . for a very usual pulsar with a 1.06-s @xmath1 and 6.3x@xmath8 g field",
    ", it would predict a value of barely 4 @xmath1 .",
    "even if this star behaved as does b0943 + 10 ( deshpande & rankin 2001)also with a longer value than predicted by the above theory  its @xmath7 would be some 12.6 @xmath1 .",
    "thus to account for the much slower observed driftrate a reduced electric potential across the gap [ as in the theoretical modifications suggested by harding  ( 2002 ) or gil  ( 2006 ) ] may be needed .",
    "another perplexing difficulty results from the subtle behaviour of the inter - null emission within the cycle .",
    "this shows two distinct drift modes , one about twice the repetition rate of the other . where this occurs in other pulsars ( , b003107 , b2303 + 30 , etc ) ,",
    "it is easy to postulate that the circulation has , for some unknown reason , speeded up the very same `` beamlets '' ( redman 2005 ) .",
    "this is harder to allege for j1819 + 1305 because it would be in conflict with the ostensible regular carousel circulation rate .",
    "we would have to reason that certain sectors of the carousel were twice as densely populated by `` beamlets '' than others , although this would not obviously explain why we tend to see the former immediately after the other .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the more rapid modulation at 3 @xmath1 is confined to the first component of the profile and generally accompanied by the `` nulling '' of the third and fourth components appears to coordinate two different sections of the underlying double cone , related only by the chance intersection of our line of sight .",
    "one possibility is that the 3-@xmath1 modulation reflects a pattern of orthogonally polarised modal beamlets ( as per rankin & ramachandran 2003 ) , but we have not been able to confirm this circumstance owing to the weakness of the pulsar s ps emission .",
    "however , this can not easily explain why the 3 p1 modulation is _ never _ found in the trailing components .",
    "we thank paulo freire and avinash deshpande for bringing the peculiar properties of this pulsar to our attention .",
