    "we have entered into a new era , where synoptic photometry for millions of stars is currently being collected and analysed ( e.g. , ogle , gaia , wasp ) . in the relatively near future , lsst will obtain synoptic photometry for billions of stars . in order to make the most of those data , we need to develop automated routines to sift through enormous datasets in order to identify light curves of interest .",
    "a precursor to that activity is to develop a better understanding of all the types of photometric variability present in real stars , and where possible to assign physical mechanisms to those variability classes .",
    "the _ kepler _ mission provided one very well characterized training set of light curves for @xmath4100,000 stars . however , because it was tied to a single position in the sky and the target stars were primarily chosen for one science goal , the _ kepler _ data only provide templates for a limited range of stellar variability types .",
    "k2 _ mission ( howell et  al .",
    "2014 ) is providing a greatly augmented set of data by observing a new group of @xmath220000 stars every three months , with those stars having a much wider range of characteristics .",
    "one specific variability type for which _",
    "k2 _ is providing a wealth of new data is young stellar objects ( ysos ) .    during campaign 2 of the _ k2 _",
    "mission , nearly 1500 candidate members of the star - forming regions comprised of the @xmath0 oph dark - cloud complex and the upper scorpius association were targeted . the data from that 78 day campaign form the largest set of precision yso optical light curves that have ever been obtained .",
    "those light curves provide a hunting ground for the search for newly formed planets via their transits ( david et  al .",
    "2016a ; mann et  al .  2016 ) , for the identification of yso eclipsing binaries ( alonso et  al .",
    "2015 ; david et  al .  2016b",
    "; kraus et  al .  2015 ; lodieu et  al .",
    "2015 ) , and for the determination of the rotational periods for a large sample of low mass stars of 5 - 10 myr age ( rebull et  al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "a small fraction of the upper sco ysos have ir excesses and are likely classical t  tauri stars ( ctts ) ; a sub - group of  burster \" lightcurves associated with some of these accreting systems is discussed in cody et  al .",
    "( 2017a ) .",
    "the discussion of our process for identifying a best set of probable upper sco members , and the categorization of light curve morphologies for the disked stars is provided in cody et al .",
    "( 2017b , in preparation ) .",
    "our sorting of those members into stars with primordial disks and those without disks ( weak - lined t tauri stars , wtts ) is described briefly below , and more fully in cody etal ( 2017b ) .",
    "about 1100 of the upper sco and @xmath0 oph stars appear not to have infrared ( ir ) excesses and presumably have shed their primordial circumstellar disks .",
    "in the course of our processing and analysis of those light curves , the vast majority were identified as showing periodic variability characteristic of stars with dark , non - axisymmetrically distributed spots .",
    "a handful were found to be eclipsing binaries , and another handful ( all relatively high mass stars ) are pulsators . however , twenty - three of the stars showed periodic photometric variability which did not fit into any of those categories .",
    "it is those stars that are the subject of this paper .",
    "all of these stars are m dwarfs , with most having spectral types between m4 and m6 .",
    "all have short periods  more than half less than one day , and all but one less than two days .    in",
    " 2 , we describe the sources of data for this paper . our process for identifying unusual light curve classes , and the working definitions we have developed for our three classes is provided in  3 .",
    "the empirical characteristics of the variability for each of the three classes is laid out in  4 - 6 .",
    "for the first three _ k2 _ campaigns , the _ k2 _ science center did not produce detrended light curves .",
    "instead , what was provided was the raw ccd pixel data for each star at each epoch .",
    "we ( cody et  al.2017a ) therefore created our own detrended light curves .",
    "we produced two primary versions ",
    "one where the aperture centers were held fixed over the course of the _ k2 _ campaign , and another where a new center was derived at each epoch . for each flavor of reduction ,",
    "photometry was produced with 2 and 3 pixel radius apertures . for each of these four light curve versions",
    ", we then applied a version of the detrending routine described in aigrain et  al .",
    "( 2016 ) to remove the short - term , non - astrophysical trends in the data .",
    "after we had begun writing this paper , two other light curve reductions became publicly available for campaign 2 , the vanderburg reduction ( vanderburg & johnson 2014 ) and the everest reduction ( luger et  al .",
    "we downloaded light curves for each of the stars that we considered as possibly relevant to this paper .    for each star addressed in this paper , we examined all of the light curve variants that we had available , and chose the one which appeared to have the least non - astrophysical contribution ( when several variants were about the same , we simply adopted our own detrended light curve ) . in all cases , the unusual features which caused us to include",
    "the star in our paper were present in multiple light curve variants .",
    "in a few cases , one of the light curve variants did not have the same signature .",
    "we believe this indicates that the detrending algorithm employed in that version removed some real astrophysical signature , or that the aperture size used in that version or the centering algorithm in that version resulted in the light curve being dominated by light from a different star .",
    "we made special effort in these cases to closely examine all the available data ( finding charts , literature , all light curve variants and different aperture sizes ) in order to make sure that the light curve we present here is the best available for that star .",
    "the ecliptic plane input catalog ( epic ; huber et  al .",
    "2016 ) catalog available at mast provides accurate coordinates for all of the stars in our sample . using those coordinates , we downloaded all available near and mid - ir photometry for our stars from the 2mass ( skrutskie et  al .",
    "2006 ) , wise ( wright et  al .",
    "2010 ) , spitzer ( werner et  al .",
    "2004 ) seip and feps ( meyer et  al .  2006 ) , akari ( murakami et  al .  2007 ) , and sdss ( e.g. , ahn et  al .  2014 ) archives as well as @xmath5 and @xmath6 band photometry from apass ( henden & munari 2014 ) .",
    "we also downloaded @xmath7 photometry for most of our stars from the pan - starrs database ( flewelling et  al .",
    "spectral types were available in the literature ( preibisch et  al .",
    "2002 , erickson et  al .",
    "2011 , lodieu et  al .",
    "2011 , luhman & mamajek 2012 , rizzuto et  al .",
    "2015 ) for 80% of our stars ; for most of the stars , those same references also provided h@xmath3 and lithium ( 6708 ) equivalent widths .",
    "we have used our own keck hires spectra to provide a small amount of new spectral information , as described in the appendix .",
    "one goal for the ancillary data was to provide a color - magnitude diagram which would include all the stars in our sample , and for that we decided to attempt to determine estimated @xmath8 colors for every star . because only a small fraction of the upper sco members have published @xmath6 band photometry , this required transforming photometry or colors obtained at other optical bands .",
    "as the first step in that process , we downloaded @xmath9 band photometry for all of our stars from the newly released gaia dr1 archive ( gaia collaboration 2016 ) .",
    "we then derived a formula to convert @xmath10 colors to @xmath8 colors based on a large sample of low mass stars with published @xmath8 colors in praesepe ( rebull et  al .",
    "2017 , submitted ) . for the stars lacking gaia photometry",
    ", we obtained @xmath11 magnitudes from the deep near - infrared survey of the southern sky ( denis ; epchtein et  al .",
    "1997 ) and derived a conversion formula in a similar way between @xmath12 and @xmath8 .",
    "we used all of the available photometry and spectral types to produce spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for each star ( the individual seds are shown in the appendix ) . from those seds , we identified stars with possible ir excesses . for each of the sources",
    "thought to have an ir excess , we looked at the images , where available , to assess the quality of the photometry .",
    "the longest wavelength data we have is either wise 22 @xmath13 m  or , for just four stars spitzer 24 @xmath13 m . in several cases , the 22 @xmath13 m  point from wise ,",
    "in particular , was not a secure detection , and the apparent ir excess therefore vanished .",
    "only one star in our final sample has a relatively secure , though small ir excess ( only at 24 @xmath13 m ) , and that is epic 205024957 .",
    "carpenter et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) also determined that epic 205024957 has a 24 @xmath13 m  excess and identified it as a debris disk .",
    "for the stars where our longest wavelength detection is at 12 @xmath13 m , the lack of an excess at that wavelength precludes them from having primordial disks . because of the paucity of good data longward of 12  @xmath13 m for most of our stars",
    ", a larger fraction could harbor debris disks .",
    "the first step in our sample selection was to eliminate stars with active accretion ( ctts ) from the upper sco and @xmath0  oph _ k2 _ sample ,",
    "since the accretion process in ctts and interactions with the primordial circumstellar disk can produce unusual light curves of many types , and addressing those types of variability was beyond the scope we wanted here ( but see cody et  al .",
    "none of the stars we retained for this paper have seds consistent with class i or ii primordial disks ( see the sed plots in the appendix , and compare , for example , to the seds of class i and ii sources in upper sco shown in cody et  al .",
    "2017a or similar sources in taurus as shown in rebull et  al .",
    "two of the stars are considered as @xmath0  oph members in the literature ( epic 203962559 and epic 203927435 ) ; all of the others are considered as members of upper sco .",
    "once we had identified the full set of upper sco weak - lined t  tauri ( wtts ) members with _ k2 _",
    "data , three of the authors ( tjd , lmr , amc ) independently examined the data for each star , including each of the light curve variants described above .",
    "they also independently searched for periodicities in those light curves and examined the phased light curves .",
    "those efforts were aimed primarily at identifying possible planet transits , or eclipsing binary candidates , or variability related to accretion or circumstellar disk structure , or in compiling stellar rotation periods . during the course of those efforts ,",
    "a few dozen stars were identified as having light curves that were not easily explained by any of those mechanisms . in those cases ,",
    "further analysis was done and other members of the team were brought in to perform more manual detrending of the light curves .",
    "this more detailed analysis resulted in some of these light curves being ascribed to artifacts in the data or to allowing them to fit into one of the established light curve classes .",
    "however , 23 of these stars survived .",
    "these stars are listed in table  1 .",
    "we have sorted our unusual light curves into three classes in order to facilitate our discussion of their properties .",
    "we acknowledge that this sorting is probably imperfect , and that the boundaries between classes are indistinct .",
    "an alternative view is that all of our stars belong to a single group , and their differing light curve morphologies arise due to a range in our view angle to their rotation axes or to a range in their rotation rates ( e.g. , because that affects the location of the keplerian co - rotation radius relative to the sublimation radius ) or to some other hidden parameter . after assembling the data we had available",
    ", we nevertheless felt it was helpful to sort the stars into the three groups in order to emphasize the shared properties within each group .",
    "table 1 provides a list of all 23 stars we have identified as belonging to these three classes , along with some of their overall defining properties .",
    "spectral types are known for 20 of these stars ; all are m dwarfs with 17 of the 20 having spectral types between m4.0 and m5.5 .",
    "most of the upper sco _",
    "k2 _ sample are m dwarfs , but the stars in table 1 are predominantly weighted towards later m sub - types ( this is also reflected in their cmd locations ",
    "see figure [ fig : uscocmd.pvmk ] ) .",
    "eighteen of the stars in table 1 have known h@xmath3 equivalent widths , all but one of which have equivalent widths appropriate for wtts ( @xmath143.0   @xmath1 eqw @xmath1 @xmath1416  ) .",
    "thirteen of the stars in table 1 have measured li 6708  equivalent widths , all of which are @xmath2  0.5  , also as appropriate for wtts mid - to - late m dwarfs ( the spectral types for two stars and the lithium data for six stars are from our own hires spectra , as described in the appendix ) .",
    "eleven of 23 ( 48% ) of the stars in table  1 have two lomb - scargle periods ( i.e. are apparent binaries ) , which seems high . from the full sample of _ k2",
    "_ m dwarf wtts with 2 @xmath1 p @xmath1 8 days ( @xmath2280 stars ) , only 16% are apparent binaries by the same measure .",
    "however , for the @xmath2140 _ k2 _",
    "m dwarfs with p @xmath1 1 day , 38% are apparent binaries .",
    "thus , the stars in table  1 may have a high binary fraction simply because the rapidly rotating low mass stars in upper sco are often binaries .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusion from stauffer et  al .",
    "( 2016 ) that m dwarfs in the pleiades with two lomb - scargle peaks were both more rapidly rotating and the two periods were closer together than would have been true if their periods were drawn at random from the single star population .",
    "figure [ fig : prototype_light_curves ] shows phased light curves for two examples of each of the three classes ; phased light curves for all members of the scallop - shell and persistent flux dip classes are provided in the appendix , along with a description of the processing we have done to the original light curves .",
    "the class definitions are as follows :    * * scallop - shells *  phased light curves that look like the rim of a scallop shell .",
    "they have many wave - shaped undulations in their phased light curves .",
    "usually the shape remains nearly constant for the entire _",
    "k2 _ campaign , but in some cases it changes over time .",
    "peak to trough amplitudes from a few percent to more than 10% ; periods always less than 0.65 days .",
    "eleven of our upper sco stars fall in this category . *",
    "* persistent flux dip class *  discrete , triangularly shaped flux dips , generally covering less than 0.15 in phase ( for each of up to 4 dips ) .",
    "the flux dips are often more or less stable in depth over the _ k2 _ campaign , with dip depths generally a few percent . outside of the dips , the phased light curves are either nearly flat or consistent with sinusoidal variation due to cool starspots .",
    "periods range from 0.5 to 1.8 days .",
    "a half dozen rapidly rotating , late m dwarf members of the pleiades with this light curve signature were identified from _ k2 _ campaign 4 data ( rebull et  al .",
    "2016 ,  3.6 ; collier cameron et  al .",
    "eight of our upper sco stars fall in this category . * * transient , narrow dip class *  more or less triangularly shaped flux dips , narrow in phase , but always variable in depth , on both short and long timescales , over the 78 day _ k2 _ campaign . only one prominent dip present in the phased light curve .",
    "dip depths generally a few percent , but up to 20% for epic 205483258 ( rik-210 ) .",
    "all four stars also show a spotted - star waveform , whose period is identical to the dip period within our uncertainties .",

    "similar features have also recently been detected in a rapidly - rotating ( p=0.44 days ) m dwarf , v374 peg ( vida et  al .",
    "jardine & van ballegooijen ( 2005 ) have proposed a model for these systems in which gas from the stellar ( parker ) wind accumulates in a lumpy torus at or above the keplerian co - rotation radius where net gravitational and magnetic forces vanish , with density maxima at the places where the radial component of the magnetic field changes polarity .",
    "these density maxima could be the  clouds \" that give rise to the light curve structure we see in the persistent flux dip and scallop - shell light curves .",
    "note that in this model , the flux dips in the _ k2 _ data arise when one of these glowing clouds is eclipsed by the star , rather than when the cloud transits the face of the star and produces the h@xmath3 absorption transients .",
    "the scallop - shells may differ from the persistent flux dip class because they have an additional source of supra - photospheric gas ",
    "gas lost through their equatorial plane because they are rotating at breakup velocity .",
    "the above speculations are at most proof of concept .",
    "the next step is to determine if the gas in these structures have densities , ionization fractions and temperatures consistent with that needed to generate the light curve features we see .",
    "we intend to address those issues in a future paper ( collier cameron et al .",
    "2017 , in prep ) .",
    "by targeting the upper sco association , the second campaign of the _ k2 _ mission provided the largest collection of high quality light curves for low mass pre - main - sequence stars ever obtained .",
    "those data made it possible to search for rare light curve types which only occur to a significant degree at very young ages and very low masses .",
    "we have , in fact , identified 23 stars with light curve morphologies which have few or no previous counterparts in the literature .",
    "we have attempted to characterize these light curves as well as possible and to identify correlations or shared characteristics among these stars and their light curves that might point to the physical mechanism responsible for creating their unusual light curve morphologies .",
    "the most striking shared characteristics of the 19 stars in our two main groups are :    * all have mid - to - late m dwarf spectral types ; * more than half of the stars have rotation periods within a factor of two of the predicted breakup period ; * eight of these stars show rapid  state - transitions \" in their light curve morphology , in many cases apparently triggered by a strong flare ; * the short - duration flux dips and highly structured phased light curves seem incompatible with star - spots as the driver of the photometric variability .",
    "warm gas clouds organized into a structured , toroidal shape located at the keplerian co - rotation radius seems to be the most plausible explanation for these characteristics .",
    "a discussion of a detailed physical model for creating and maintaining these clouds and for their producing our observed light curve morphologies is provided in collier cameron et  al .",
    "( 2017 , in prep ) .",
    "the four other upper sco stars we have identified have single short - duration flux dips superposed on normal spotted - star light curves , with the dip period and spot period being identical .",
    "the flux dips have highly variable depths and shapes , with shapes that are often asymmetric .",
    "these characteristics seem better matched to some type of dusty debris , orbiting a young planet located at or near the keplerian co - rotation radius .",
    "a detailed examination of the best studied of this group ( rik-210 ) and a comparison of those data to a variety of physical models is provided in david et  al .",
    "( 2016c ) .    while the unusual light curve morphologies we find in upper sco may only be present for a small fraction of stars during a brief time interval in their early evolution , understanding these stars may have more far reaching implications .",
    "if an ab dor slingshot prominence type model is found to be appropriate for the scallop - shell and persistent flux dip morphologies , then analysis of those stars may provide important new clues to the magnetic field topologies , winds and mass loss rates of low mass stars .",
    "these data could also help explain the comparatively uniform and rapid rotation found for most field brown dwarfs . if a young planet is present near the keplerian co - rotation radius for the four transient flux - dip stars , that also could have significant implications for models of planet formation , particularly around m dwarfs .",

    "our standard processing ( see  3 ) produced light curves from which short - term non - astrophysical trends had been removed and identified the best lomb - scargle period ( or periods ) for each star .",
    "plots were created showing the original light curve and the light curve phased to each period identified for the star .",
    "those latter plots were the basis for selecting stars that might be included in this paper .    in order to produce higher quality versions of the phased light curves and to validate stars for inclusion in the paper , we conducted additional processing . for stars with long - term trends in their light curve , we fit low order polynomials to the data and then removed the long - term trend ( assuming that it was likely to be non - astrophysical  but that in any case the presence of the long term trend would degrade the ability to phase - fold the light curve and examine its detailed structure ) . in some cases , even after this step , the light curve retained bumps and wiggles on timescales much longer than the rotation period but shorter than the _ k2 _ campaign length . in those cases , we determined the median count - rate at each period and then normalized the data in each period to the same rate ( for stars with very short periods , we instead adopted an interval of 4 periods for the calculation ) .",
    "this again could remove real flux variations from the light curve , but removing these trends allowed us to produce phased light curves with significantly less noise .",
    "more than half of the scallop - shell and persistent narrow flux dip stars had two significant , narrow - peaked , independent ( non - harmonic ) lomb - scargle periods , indicating that they are binaries ( or at least that light from two stars is contributing to the _ k2 _ light curve ) . in all cases ,",
    "the plots from our standard processing showed one of the two stars to be relevant for this paper with the other star appearing to have a normal , spotted star light curve .",
    "for these systems , we adopted an iterative approach to the final processing .",
    "first , we phased the initial light curve to the period of the star that appears to have the larger light curve amplitude .",
    "we then derived a median smoothed version of that light curve , and then subtracted that median - smoothed light curve from the initial light curve  resulting in a residual light curve that should largely be the signal from the second star .",
    "we then phased that residual light curve to the second lomg - scargle period , derived a median - smoothed version of that , and then subtracted this median - smoothed light curve from the initial light curve - resulting in a new residual light curve that should largely be the signal from the 1st star ( now with the signal from the second star largely removed ) .",
    "this process was repeated if necessary  with the final product being a phased light curve for the star of interest , from which most or all of the signal from the binary companion had been removed .",
    "cool spots generally produce phased light curve morphologies ressembling sinusoids or broad dips or humps whose fwzi is approximately 50% in phase .",
    "that is because spots seen from most view angles will be visible for nearly half the rotation period of the star ( or more ) , and therefore the signatures they impose on the light curve will span half or more in extent of the phased light curve .",
    "however , for a view angle which places a spot very near the top or bottom of the visible hemisphere of the star , the spot could be visible for significantly less than half the rotation period .",
    "therefore , it is conceivable that in such geometries , single spots could produce narrow flux dips ( as observed for our persistent or transient flux dip class ) or that several spots at widely spaced longitudes could produce the highly structured , wavy phased light curves we find for the scallop - shell class .    to test this hypothesis ,",
    "we have created a program to produce simulated light curves for stars with up to four cool spots placed at arbitrary latitudes and longitudes , and viewed from an arbitary view angle .",
    "the spots are required to be circular and to have a uniform surface brightness that is a factor of between 0.0 and 1.0 of the surface brightness of the pristine photosphere of the star .",
    "the star is assumed to be spherical .",
    "we adopt a linear limb darkening law , and a limb darkening coefficent ( normally designated as `` u '' ) of 0.8 , following the tables of claret et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) for a mid - m dwarf and for the _ kepler _ camera .",
    "we then allow the star to rotate , and measure its brightness after every 1 degree in rotation , following the star for a complete rotation period .",
    "for the present purposes , we set all the spots to be `` black ''  that is , non - emitting  because that will produce the largest possible amplitude for a given spot size .",
    "we have first used the program to attempt to produce narrow flux dips that might be similar to those we observe .",
    "the persistent flux dip stars have fwzi for their dips ranging from 0.06 to 0.2 ( in fractional phase ) and depths ranging from 1% to 7.5% , with an average of about 2.5% .",
    "the transient flux dip stars have fwzi for their dips of about 0.06 , 0.08 , 0.20 and 0.20 and maximum depths of 1.5% , 2.5% , 3% and 20% . to determine if those properties can be matched by cool spots , we first ran models with single spots of 8 degree radius , viewed from a range of locations up to a view angle which places the spot essentially at the upper limb of the visible hemisphere when the spot is facing the observer . figure [ fig : onespot_8d ] shows the flux dips resulting from those spots for the selected viewing angles .",
    "figure [ fig : spotwidth_depth_8d ] shows how the width and depth of these flux dips vary with view angle .",
    "based on the two preceding figures , spots with radii of 8@xmath45 or less can not be responsible for our short - duration flux dips because they are incapable of producing dip depths of 1% or more .",
    "we therefore decided to try a larger spot ; specifically a spot of radius 18@xmath45 .",
    "figure [ fig : onespot_18d ] and figure [ fig : spotwidth_depth_18d ] show the flux dip shapes and their depth and width as a function of the observer s view to the star . a spot this size can produce flux dip depths of several percent",
    "; however , the dips are relatively broad .",
    "the plots demonstrate that no view angle will produce a dip with depth @xmath4 1%  and fwzi @xmath46 0.2 .",
    "we have tried other combinations of parameters , but the answers are always the same . for any cold spot that can produce a fwzi of 0.2 or less , the spot depth will always be much less than 1%",
    ". therefore , cold spots can not be the explanation for the short - duration flux dips for either our persistent flux dip or transient flux dip light curves .    as a test to determine if appropriately arranged spots could produce phased light curves ressembling the scallop - shell class , we placed four spots of 8 to 10@xmath45 radius at latitudes between 60 and 62@xmath45 and longitudes of 0 , 80 , 180 and 250@xmath45 .",
    "we first put the observer at a latitude of @xmath1424@xmath45 in order for those spots to be near the upper limb of the star as seen by the observer .",
    "as shown in the first panel of figure [ fig : model_scallop ] , this does produce a phased light curve whose shape is reasonably similar to several of the stars in our scallop shell class .",
    "however , the light curve amplitude is tiny .",
    "the other panels in figure [ fig : model_scallop ] show that while the amplitude does increase as the observer to spot angle decreases , the degree of structure in the light curve also decreases . by the point where the light curve amplitude is @xmath21.0% ,",
    "the morphology of the light curve is much smoother and no longer ressembles the scallop - shell stars .",
    "choosing larger spots does not help  there is again a trade off between degree of structure in the light curve and amplitude , and in no case have we been able to produce shapes which approximate our stars and had amplitudes @xmath4 0.4% . because many of the scallop - shell stars have light curve amplitudes of 5 - 10%",
    ", we conclude that cold spots also are unable to explain the scallop - shell light curve morphologies ."
