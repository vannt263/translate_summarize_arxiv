    "spin - dependent tunnelling between ferromagnetic electrodes separated by an insulating barrier is the basis of many magnetic data storage technologies .",
    "many of these technologies are based on the tunnelling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) effect whereby the current that flows through such a device is strongly dependent on the relative magnetization of the magnetic layers due to the spin - dependent density of states . switching between parallel ( p ) and antiparallel ( ap )",
    "alignment causes a change in the device resistance @xcite .",
    "tmr is generally defined as ( i@xmath1 - i@xmath2 ) / i@xmath2 where i@xmath1 is the current through the junction with parallel magnetic alignment and i@xmath2 is the current through the junction with antiparallel alignment . using scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) , where the role of the second electrode is played by a magnetic tip and tunnelling occurs through the vacuum rather than through an insulating layer , it is possible to detect a tmr effect for even single magnetic adatoms on surfaces @xcite .",
    "further to this , due to spin - orbit coupling , the resistance can also depend on the magnetization direction relative to the crystallographic axes , an effect which has been coined the tunnelling anisotropic magnetoresistance ( tamr ) effect  @xcite .",
    "the tamr effect is a particularly attractive route for alternative spintronics applications as only one ferromagnetic electrode is required and the effect does not require coherent spin - dependent transport .",

    "( w atoms not shown ) . ]",
    "the tamr effect was first experimentally observed in @xmath3 measurements taken above the domains and domain walls of a double layer of fe on w(110 ) where the magnetization pointed out - of - plane and in - plane , respectively @xcite .",
    "tamr effects were subsequently found in planar ferromagnetic junctions @xcite , tunnel junctions @xcite and mechanically controlled break junctions @xcite .",
    "the tamr effect also allows the possibility of imaging noncollinear spin structures on the atomic scale using stm with non - magnetic tips @xcite , although the measured corrugation amplitudes were quite small .",
    "as the effect is driven by spin - orbit coupling , attempts have been made to increase its magnitude by combining 3@xmath4 and 5@xmath4 elements in bimetallic alloys @xcite and with antiferromagnetic electrodes @xcite .",
    "a microscopic understanding of the mechanisms governing the tamr effect , and in particular how it scales down to the atomic scale , can be achieved by considering the limiting case of a single adatom .",
    "serrate found evidence of spin - orbit related effects in co adatoms adsorbed on a mn monolayer ( ml ) grown on a w(110 ) substrate  @xcite .",
    "this surface displays a spin spiral ground state with spins propagating along the [ 1@xmath50 ] direction with an angle of @xmath6173@xmath0 between neighbouring magnetic moments ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tmr_tamr ] ) @xcite . in this sense it acts as an atomic - scale noncollinear magnetic template so that by moving adatoms laterally on the surface it is possible to control to a high degree the spin direction of the adatom .",
    "the co adatom couples ferromagnetically to the underlying magnetic thin film via heisenberg exchange , allowing for the spin to take any direction that is accessible in the mn spin - spiral - not only those directions perpendicular and parallel to the plane defined by the surface .",
    "stm line profiles along the [ 1@xmath50 ] direction above a row of deposited co adatoms showed that although the height above the atomic centres followed an approximate @xmath7 profile as expected for the tmr effect , where @xmath8 is the angle between the tip magnetization direction and the magnetization of the respective co adatom , better agreement could be achieved by including a small percentage of the higher order correction @xmath9 .",
    "it was proposed that this correction could be attributed to spin - orbit coupling , and in particular the tamr effect .",
    "more recently , nel considered the change in electronic properties of a co adatom adsorbed on the domain or domain wall of a double layer fe film grown on the w(110 ) substrate @xcite .",
    "they performed spectroscopy measurements on co adatoms with out - of - plane and in - plane magnetization direction and found a tamr effect that repeatedly changes sign as a function of bias voltage and with a magnitude as large as 12% .",
    "the observed tamr was explained based on a first - principles calculation of the anisotropy of the local density of states in the vacuum .    here",
    ", we propose to study adatoms on noncollinear spin structures in order to explore the angular dependence and the magnitude of the tamr .",
    "an advantage of using a surface with noncollinear magnetic ordering is that the magnetization direction of the adatom can be tuned almost continuously without requiring an external magnetic field .",
    "this is achieved instead relying only on the local exchange interaction between the adatom and the surface .",
    "we use first - principles calculations based on density functional theory to investigate valence isoelectronic transition - metal adatoms of increasing atomic number , namely co , rh and ir , on a mn monolayer on w(110 ) which displays a spin - spiral ground state .",
    "we consider the two limiting cases of the spin direction , i.e. , when the magnetization direction points perpendicular to the surface and when it points in - plane along the [ 1@xmath50 ] direction , as shown in fig .  [ fig : tmr_tamr ] .",
    "we find that the adsorption of such adatoms can be used to enhance the spin - orbit coupling strength locally above a surface and in doing so offers a route to the determination of whether or not a surface spin structure displays noncollinearity using conventional stm with non - magnetic tips .",
    "in particular , the tamr is dramatically enhanced for heavy 5@xmath4 transition - metal adatoms , which become spin - polarized by the substrate .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "after briefly presenting the computational method and the details of the calculation , we proceed to describe the electronic structure of the three adatoms adsorbed on the surface , focusing in particular on the vacuum density of states and the subsequent tamr effect .",

    "as the largest contribution to the ldos in the vacuum comes from states with @xmath16 symmetry ( as well as @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) , it follows that the largest contribution to the tamr will come from a modification of the @xmath16 states .",
    "this is highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig : co_adatom](b ) where the red dashed line shows the anisotropy of the co @xmath16 states at the atom .",

    "the largest contribution to the tamr at @xmath60  ev originates from spin - orbit induced mixing of these @xmath16 states with states of @xmath67 and @xmath15 character whereas the peaks in the tamr close to the fermi level originate from interactions between the @xmath16 states and minority states of @xmath15 and @xmath65 symmetry .      in an stm experiment the tunnelling current measured above adatoms with two different magnetization directions at a given bias voltage will be composed of a constant part , @xmath68 or @xmath69 , depending on the contributing electronic states and a height dependent part so that @xmath70 and @xmath71 . in the limit of low bias voltages the decay constant can be written as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the apparent height of the tunnelling barrier .",

    "@xcite .    as an aside , we note here the implications of experimentally extracting the tamr from the current measurements . as this method integrates all states within the bias window , it is possible that as the bias is increased the tamr will become smaller , as any oscillations present in the asymmetry of the local density of states cancel each other .",

    "our results demonstrate that the deposition of transition - metal adatoms can be used to determine whether or not noncollinear magnetic ordering is present on magnetic surfaces and that the magnitude of this effect can be increased dramatically using 5@xmath4 adatoms . to date , studies of the tamr of single adatoms using an stm tip have been performed by exploiting the domain and domain wall structures of ferromagnetic surfaces .",
    "we propose that the use of a spin - spiral surface removes , to a great degree , the constraint imposed by the substrate magnetization direction , and opens up the possibility to study the angular dependence and the magnitude of the tamr effect on individual adatoms . we emphasise that this effect will be seen even with a non - magnetic stm tip .",
