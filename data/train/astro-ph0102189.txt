    "in the accompanying article , eisenhauer @xcite both introduces this subject and provides a summary of many indirect evidences that the imf is seen to vary .",
    "much of his evidence is based on the review of john scalo @xcite in the recent conference `` the stellar initial mass function '' @xcite .",
    "scalo s review , while compelling , is in disagreement with the remainder of the contributions to that volume .",
    "thus , it is worth noting immediately that the concensus among expert opinion has changed dramatically in recent years , as data have improved .",
    "previously it was assumed that the imf was variable , and the task of observation was to quantify those changes .",
    "one hoped to identify some dominant parameter ( metallicity , environment , .. ) , whose identification would in turn lead star formation theory towards reality .",
    "the holy grail of explaining ( baryonic ) dark matter in the universe was a further motivation in the early days , though now accepted to be irrelevant to imf studies : even in an extreme interpretation of the data , ( and lots of such analyses exist ) the stellar imf is irrelevant to the dominant problem of dark matter .",
    "the postulation of a universal imf  in its strongest form  states that the imf is and has always been the same in all regions of star formation everywhere ; the frequencies of initial stellar masses in any unbiased sample are always drawn from the same statistical distribution function .    a decade ago , the scientific null hypothesis was that the imf should vary , based on naive theory , and did vary , based on extant analyses of observations .",
    "a second major open problem , identification of the ` missing mass ' , was certainly relevant to determination of the number of low mass stars .",
    "applying the long - standing scientific rule that any explanation of one problem which incidentally explains a second is progress , quantifying imf variations became a reasonable default experiment .",
    "as the data improved however  the star count data has extended faintward by some 20 magnitudes in the red / infrared during the last two decades  and as an appreciation of the physical complexity of star forming regions observed only in integrated light arose , and , most importantly , as the number of high - quality very detailed hst studies of star clusters increased , the evidence in favour of apparent imf variations has decreased .",
    "the unexpected current result is that any variation in the imf is startlingly small .",
    "the observational situation has changed so much that the conservative assumption has now inverted .",
    "that is , the conservative assumption is now that the imf is invariant , and that apparent variations are due to unrecognised complexities in the physical situation being analysed , and the statistics of small samples , both convolved with recognised difficulties in the conversion of observables  ionisation state , metallicity , age range , stellar colour , ... into fundamental parameters , such as mass .",
    "this null hypothesis is clearly extreme : zero intrinsic variation in the imf seems ab initio implausible , given the diversity of physical conditions in which stars form .",
    "however , the observations point to a situation in which variation in the imf is a second - order effect .",
    "here we consider two complementary conservative questions : first , is there any irrefutable evidence that the imf is variable , and secondly , do we know what the imf is ?",
    "i conclude that there is indeed no robust evidence for variation , while there remains considerable ( systematic ) uncertainty in quantifying the underlying ( invariant ) imf .",
    "was the imf different in the early universe than it is today ?",
    "a variety of indications suggest such changes , primarily indirectly from attempts to model the chemical evolution of the igm , to explain galaxy cluster abundances , and to explain the lack of very metal - poor stars in the galactic halo .",
    "all of these suffer inevitable uncertainty from the many simplyfying approximations involved in modelling gas flows , accretion histories , outflows , and so on .      although absolute chemical abundances remain poorly understood , some much less indirect constraints are available from the relative abundances of the chemical elements .",
    "the relative abundances of a subset of the elements are determined purely by the high mass stellar imf , and the rate of star formation .",
    "the astrophysics of this analysis is described in many published papers and need not be detailed here .",
    "( an example of one of the many relevant reviews is @xcite ) .",
    "the essential feature is that the ratio of the elements created purely in high mass stars to those elements created primarily in lower mass stars is manifestly a measure of the relative numbers of such stars , and so the slope of the imf .    the state of recent observational determinations of this ratio is illustrated in fig .  1 , from chen et al .",
    "@xcite , who also discuss the current uncertainties in understanding elemental production sites . for present purposes however , the essential result is that observational determinations , by many different authors , agree that metal - poor stars show a systematic overabundance of the alpha elements , created in high - mass stars , relative to the abundance of the iron - peak elements , created in lower mass stars .",
    "the absolute value of the overabundance thus provides a limit on the high - mass imf slope at very early times .",
    "extant modelling ( eg @xcite ) limits any imf variation relative to the present - day imf to be less than about 0.3 in slope , a maximum systematic change comparable to the uncertainty in direct star - count determinations of the slope today .",
    "thus , modelling chemical element data provides no evidence for any systematic change in the imf slope over the whole age of the universe .",
    "it is very easy to expect the imf to vary strongly in starburst regions .",
    "the relevant observational suggestions are well reviewed by eisenhauer @xcite .",
    "as so often is the case , one may however provide theoretical expectation to favour all possible outcomes . in particular , the concept of a jeans mass , and calculations of small perturbations from stability in a self - gravitating system , are least likely to be relevant in a starburst , where one must expect dramatic inhomogeneity and significant shock energy .",
    "analysis of observational data on current starbursts is necessarily dependent on simplifying assumptions of the stellar age and metallicity distributions , and is inevitably very sensitive to the relative spatial distributions of stars , dust and the ism , together with any non - thermal energy sources which may be present .",
    "there is one simple observational test , which does not probe the most extreme high star formation rates , does probe most of the available dynamic range , but is limited to low masses .",
    "that is to compare the present - day imf in the remnants of high and low star formation rate systems .",
    "the remnant high - rate systems are globular clusters .",
    "these are limited in duration of formation by the lack of a spread in abundances , and additionally are seen today to be forming rapidly , and to be forming in starburst galaxies .",
    "globular clusters seem to form @xmath0 stars in 1myr , for a rate of @xmath1 .",
    "the remnant low star formation rate systems are the dsph galaxies .",
    "the star formation rate can not have been high in these fragile galaxies .",
    "quantitative determinations of the rates , eg by hernandez , gilmore , and valls - gabaud @xcite , derive star formation rates of order @xmath2 that in galaxy disks today , and so some 3 - 7 orders of magnitude below those of globular clusters .",
    "the difference in present stellar volume density is similar .",
    "a direct comparison of the stellar luminosity function in a globular cluster and dsph galaxy has recently been obtained , by feltzing , wyse & gilmore @xcite .",
    "they compared the luminosity functions of unevolved , low mass stars in the umi dsph galaxy and in the globular cluster m92 .",
    "both these systems are of similar age and metallicity , so the luminosity function comparison is an imf comparison .",
    "the systems have star formation rates and present stellar density differing by about 6 orders of magnitude , and very different mass : light ratios .",
    "the results , shown in fig .  2 , show very clearly that there is no detectable imf difference between these systems for stars with masses in the range @xmath3 .",
    "differential comparison between comparable systems with large numbers of stars is the most sensitive way to identify real imf variations .",
    "the best case available , and the most studied , are the galactic and local group globular clusters .",
    "these contain large numbers of stars , minimising statistical sampling errors ( see below ) , and have little or no internal metallicity range , minimising the need for reliable stellar models ( see below ) .",
    "the mass - luminosity relation does of course change systematically with metallicity , generating a systematic change in luminosity function with metallicity .",
    "this is seen @xcite , and is to first order consistent with a constant imf over the metallicity range from @xmath4dex to the solar value . at a specific metallicity",
    "one may in principle provide more exact comparisons .",
    "the extant hst cluster luminosity function data are collected in fig .  3 , where large variations are apparent .",
    "are these real imf variations ?",
    "systematic changes with time away from the primordial imf of a globular cluster are an inevitable consequence of internal dynamical evolution .",
    "mass segregation must happen , as will stellar merging and mass - dependent mass and star loss from the cluster .",
    "to date , modelling this rich mix of physical effects has not been computationally feasible , so that highly simplified diffusion modelling ( fokker - planck ) has been necessary .",
    "such modelling is necessarily inexact in the densest regions , where 2-body interactions are dominant .",
    "the best available calculations of this type are still unable to reproduce observed distributions of cluster properties , so considerable caution is required .",
    "recent advances in n - body systems , especially grape , are starting to allow more realistic modelling , and hold great promise .",
    "in particular , the important effects of cluster core dynamical evolution , and external tides can be included reliably @xcite .",
    "an indication of the potential importance of these effects is seen in fig .  4 , which plots the differences between cluster luminosity functions seen in fig .  3 as a function of distance from the galactic plane .",
    "this distance is a crude measure of tidal forces , and suggests that these additional factors are important .",
    "preliminary modelling from extant grape facilities suggests that the range of luminosity function slopes seen is ( marginally ) consistent with the effects of dynamical evolutions which are feasible , assuming a universal imf .",
    "until the next generation of such models are available , it is premature to interpret the real differences in present day luminosity functions of clusters as evidence for variation in the primordial imf .",
    "determination of the imf from star count data is a complex challenge .",
    "in addition to the obvious requirement for high - quality observational data with reliable calibrations , there are many other factors in the analysis .",
    "the most obvious among these include effects of stellar age , multiplicity , and metallicity , mass segregation , sample incompleteness , primordial and dynamical mass segregation ....",
    "these , plus all the many other contributions to the malmquist bias , were considered explicitely by kroupa , tout & gilmore ( ktg @xcite ) .",
    "recently , kroupa @xcite has updated this analysis , also including the effects of sampling noise .",
    "sampling noise is dominant in most published imf determinations , which are studies of young open clusters with few members .",
    "kroupa s current `` best '' imf is shown in fig .",
    "note that this imf , which is very similar to that of ktg , increases systematically to the hydrogen burning limit .    to consider variations from this mean imf in any observed sample",
    ", it is easiest to consider @xmath5 , the gradient of this function , rather than the function itself .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "6 , the alpha - plot .",
    "an important point is the extent to which the scatter of observational points in the alpha - plot indicates real variation .",
    "in addition to the systematic effects considered below , there is one important effect to emphasise : statistical sampling noise , due to the finite and small number of stars in a star - forming region .",
    "this has a disproportionate effect at high masses , where the numbers are very small .",
    "the effect is shown in fig .  7 ,    overall",
    ", this analysis illustrates that sampling and observational effects , together with the many other contributions to malmquist bias , dominate available data : any direct evidence for imf variation is not robust .",
    "a further very important factor is illustrated in fig .",
    "8 : even if one has a large sample with accurate data , conversion of an observed luminosity and derived effective temperature to source mass is not a robust procedure .",
    "extant stellar models are uncertain by an amount that is large compared to deduced changes in the imf @xcite .",
    "variations of the stellar initial mass function have been reported for all masses and in a large variety of stellar populations .",
    "we show that in ( almost ) all cases the suggested variation is either dependent on simplifying assumptions made in other important parameters , or is dominated by sampling noise .",
    "some direct evidence exists showing the imf has been invariant over 12gyr , at all abundances from to at least the solar value , in systems with stellar densities covering 6 orders of magnitude , and in systems with a range of star formation rates spanning at least 6 orders of magnitude .",
    "this remarkable and unexpected constancy , showing any real variation to be a second order , suggests the physics underlying the imf is dominated locally by the central limit theorem , rather than one or a few dominant parameters .",
