    "the structure of the qcd phase diagram and thermodynamics at finite baryon density is of crucial importance in heavy - ion phenomenology . due to the sign problem in lattice calculations , a major approach to a finite density qcd",
    "is based on effective lagrangians possessing the same global symmetries as the underlying qcd .",
    "the @xmath0 yang - mills theory has a global @xmath1 symmetry which is dynamically broken at high temperature .",
    "this is characterized by the polyakov loop that plays a role of an order parameter of the @xmath1 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "effective models for the polyakov loop were suggested as a macroscopic approach to the pure gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "their thermodynamics is qualitatively in agreement with that obtained in lattice gauge theories  @xcite .",
    "alternative approaches are based on the quasi - particle picture of thermal gluons  @xcite .",

    "we summarize its properties and argue that at hight temperatures , it exhibits the correct asymptotic behavior , whereas at low temperatures , it disfavors gluons  @xcite .",
    "we therefore suggest a hybrid approach to yang - mills thermodynamics , which combines the effective gluon potential with glueballs implemented as dilaton fields .",
    "also , we propose an effective theory of su(3 ) gluonic matter  @xcite .",
    "the theory is constructed based on the center and scale symmetries and their dynamical breaking , so that the interplay between color - electric and color - magnetic gluons is included coherently .",

    "described by the gluon sector ( [ full ] ) apparently indicates , that gluons are _ physically _ forbidden .",

    "the resulting eos follows general trends seen in lattice data  @xcite .",
    "the model can be improved further by introducing a thermal gluon mass , @xmath79 , as carried out e.g. in @xcite .",
    "asymptotic properties of non - abelian gauge theories at finite temperature are successfully captured in the quasi - particle description , which can be consistently calculated in the leading - order perturbation theory  @xcite . however , a naive perturbative treatment in the weak coupling @xmath80 is spoiled since the magnetic screening mass is dynamically generated as a ultra - soft scale @xmath81  @xcite . the magnetic sector remains non - perturbative in the high temperature phase , and consequently , the spatial string tension is non - vanishing for all temperatures  @xcite , indicating certain confining properties .",
    "this residual interaction brings apparent deviations in equations of state ( eos ) from their stefan - boltzmann limit at high temperature .",
    "in particular , the interaction measure @xmath82 is the best observable to examine dynamical breaking of scale invariance of the yang - mills ( ym ) lagrangian . in lattice simulations of pure su(3 ) ym theory the @xmath83 , with the deconfinement critical temperature @xmath53 , is nearly constant in the range @xmath84 .",
    "this observation strongly suggests non - trivial dynamical effects  @xcite . beyond",
    "this temperature range the lattice data follow the results from the hard thermal loop ( htl ) resummed perturbation theory .",
    "thus , a non - perturbative part in the lattice data is extracted by subtracting the htl contribution  @xcite .",
    "the resultant non - perturbative part in @xmath83 is _ monotonically _ decreasing , whereas the htl result is monotonically increasing with @xmath85 .",
    "a plateau that arises in intermediate temperatures in @xmath83 can be therefore understood as resulting from the summation of those two contributions .    in @xcite",
    ", we formulate an effective theory of su(3 ) gluonic matter , which accounts for two dynamically different contributions , the chromomagnetic and chromoelectric gluons . in general , the dilaton couples also to the polyakov loop which is the order parameter of confinement - deconfinement phase transition and belongs to the color - electric sector .",
    "thus , the dilaton captures the thermodynamic properties around the critical point @xmath53 , which are related with both , the color - electric and color - magnetic gluons .",
    "thermal behavior of the magnetic gluon condensate at high temperature is found , using the three - dimensional ym theories  @xcite , as  @xcite @xmath86 with @xmath87 the constants @xmath88 and @xmath89 appear in @xmath90 and in the magnetic gluon mass as @xmath91 for @xmath2 ym theory @xmath92  @xcite and @xmath93  @xcite .",
    "the potential that mixes the dilaton field and the polyakov loop should be manifestly invariant under @xmath1 and scale transformation . for @xmath94 ,",
    "its most general form is as the following  @xcite , @xmath95 with unknown coefficients @xmath96 . in the following , we take only the first term .    at high temperature , due to the dimensional reduction , the theory in four dimensions should match the three - dimensional ym theory .",
    "we postulate the following matching condition , @xmath97 this transmutation from @xmath98 const . to @xmath99",
    "leads to an additional contribution to the interaction measure : @xmath100 the interaction measure normalized by @xmath101 is monotonically decreasing even at high temperature when no matching to the 3-dim ym is made .",
    "the magnetic contribution generates a @xmath102 dependence .",
    "the sum of those two contributions forms a plateau - like behavior in @xmath103 at moderate temperature , @xmath104-@xmath105 .",
    "this property appears due to the residual chromomagnetic interaction encoded in the dilaton , @xmath106 .",
    "the resulting behavior of @xmath103 with temperature qualitatively agrees with the latest high - precision lattice data  @xcite .",
    "we note that a smooth switching from the dilaton to the magnetic condensate must happen dynamically , so that thermodynamic quantities , such as the specific heat , do not experience any irregular behavior above @xmath53 .",
    "we have derived the thermodynamic potential in the @xmath2 yang - mills theory in the presence of a uniform gluon background field .",
    "the potential accounts for quantum statistics and reproduces an ideal gas limit at high temperature . within the character expansion , the one - to - one correspondence to the effective action in the strong - coupling expansion is obtained .",
    "different effective potentials used so far appear as limiting cases of our result .",
    "the phenomenological consequence is that gluons are disfavored as appropriate degrees of freedom in confined phase .",
    "this property is in remarkable contrast to the description of `` confinement '' within a class of chiral models with polyakov loops  @xcite , where colored quarks are activated at any temperature .",
    "we have also presented an effective theory implementing the major global symmetries , the center and scale symmetries , and their dynamical breaking .",
    "this naturally allows a mixing between the polyakov loop and the dilaton field .",
    "consequently , the magnetic confinement is effectively embedded and results in deviations of the eos from their stefan - boltzmann limit at high temperature . through a matching to the 3-dimensional ym theory ,",
    "the gluon condensate increases with temperature in deconfined phase .",
    "contrary , in the conventional treatment of the dilaton condensate , there is a weak thermal behavior of the composite gluon in a wide range of temperature .",
    "this suggests , that at some temperature above @xmath53 , the gluon condensate exhibits a distinct behavior on @xmath85 . in the present theory",
    "this temperature is roughly estimated as @xmath107 , compatible with @xmath108 extracted from the spatial string tension  @xcite . applying this idea to the interaction measure",
