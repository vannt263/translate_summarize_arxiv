    "fidelity , as a measure of the distinguishability between quantum states@xcite , plays an important role in many areas of quantum information science , for example it is related to the precision limit in quantum metrology  @xcite , serves as a measure of entanglement preservation through noisy quantum channels  @xcite , and a measure of entanglement preservation in quantum memory  @xcite ; it has also been used as a characterization method for quantum phase transitions  @xcite , and a criterion for successful transmission in formulating quantum channel capacities  @xcite . unlike the fidelity of quantum states",
    "which is defined directly on quantum states , most commonly used measures for the distinguishability of quantum channels are defined indirectly through the effects of the channels on the states .",
    "for example the diamond norm , which is defined as @xmath0@xcite ( here @xmath1 , @xmath2 denotes a state on system+ancilla , and @xmath3 denotes the identity operator on the ancillary system ) , is induced by the trace distance on quantum states @xmath4 ; another measure on quantum channels which is defined as @xmath5$]@xcite , is induced by the fidelity on quantum states @xmath6 .",
    "these induced measures through quantum states lack a direct connection to the properties of quantum channels , which severely restrict the insights that can be gained from these measures . a direct measure on quantum channels",
    "is expected to provide more insights thus highly desired .    in this paper",
    "we provide a fidelity function defined directly on quantum channels , and show that this fidelity function on quantum channels , together with the classical fidelity on probability distribution and the fidelity on quantum states , form a hierarchy of fidelity functions in terms of optimization . this fidelity function on quantum channels also lead to various distance measures defined directly on quantum channels , in particular we show the bures angle and the bures distance can be extended to quantum channels .",
    "we then show the distance between quantum channels leads naturally to a new fisher information on quantum channels which quantifies the ultimate precision limit in quantum metrology .",
    "we also show that this fidelity function provides a unified framework for perfect quantum channel discrimination and quantum metrology , in particular we show the minimum number of uses needed for perfect channel discrimination is exactly the counterpart of the precision limit in quantum metrology , and various useful lower bounds for the minimum number of uses needed for perfect channel discrimination can be obtained via this connection .",
    "we start by defining the fidelity function on unitary channels then extend it to noisy channels .    for a @xmath7 unitary matrix @xmath8 ,",
    "we denote @xmath9 as the eigenvalues of @xmath8 , where @xmath10 $ ] for @xmath11 and we call @xmath12 the eigen - angles of @xmath8",
    ". we define(see also@xcite ) @xmath13 and @xmath14 as the minimum of @xmath15 over equivalent unitary operators with different global phases , i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "we then define @xmath17 quantitatively @xmath18 is equal to the maximal angle that @xmath8 can rotate a state away from itself@xcite , i.e. , @xmath19=\\min_{|\\psi\\rangle}|\\langle \\psi |u |\\psi \\rangle|.$ ] for mixed states it can be written as @xmath19=\\min_{\\rho}f_s(\\rho , u\\rho u^\\dagger).$ ]    if @xmath20 are arranged in decreasing order , then @xmath21 when @xmath22@xcite .",
    "we then define @xmath23 , here @xmath24 and @xmath25 are unitary operators on the same hilbert space(we can expand the space if they are not the same ) .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath26&=\\cos[c(u_1^\\dagger u_2)]\\\\   & = \\min_{\\rho}f_s(u_1\\rho u_1^\\dagger , u_2\\rho u_2^\\dagger ) , \\endaligned\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath27 thus corresponds to the maximal angle between the output states of @xmath24 and @xmath25(however we note that the definition of @xmath27 is independent of the states ) .",
    "we then denote @xmath28 $ ] as the fidelity between @xmath24 and @xmath25 . for unitary channels",
    "this is equivalent to the fidelity function proposed previously in @xcite .",
    "we now generalize this to noisy quantum channels .",
    "a general quantum channel @xmath29 , which maps from @xmath30- to @xmath31-dimensional hilbert space , can be represented by kraus operators , @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "equivalently it can also be written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes some standard state of the environment , and @xmath36 is a unitary operator acting on both system and environment , which we call as the unitary extension of @xmath29 .",
    "we define @xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath39 are unitary extensions of @xmath40 , @xmath41 . in appendix",
    "[ app - compute ] , we show that the optimization can be taken by fixing one unitary extension and just optimizing over the other unitary extension , i.e. , @xmath42 in terms of @xmath43 it can be written as @xmath44 this can be seen as the counterpart of uhlmann s purification theorem on quantum states  @xcite(however the proof does not use uhlmann s purification theorem  @xcite ) . in appendix  [ app - metric ] , we show that @xmath45 is a metric and can be computed directly from the kraus operators of @xmath46 and @xmath47 as  @xcite @xmath48 here @xmath49 denotes the minimum eigenvalue of @xmath50 with @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote the kraus operators of @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively , @xmath54 denotes the @xmath55-th entry of a @xmath56 matrix @xmath57 with @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the operator norm which corresponds to the maximum singular value , here @xmath57 arises from the non - uniqueness of the kraus representations .",
    "thus @xmath60 we emphasize that @xmath61 is defined directly on quantum channels without referring to the states , such direct connection , in contrast to the induced measure , is crucial when applying the fidelity to channel discrimination and quantum metrology as we will show later .",
    "furthermore the fidelity can be formulated as a semi - definite programming and computed efficiently as @xmath62 @xmath63    analogous to the bures distance on quantum states @xmath64 , we can similarly define a bures distance on quantum channels as @xmath65 . in appendix",
    "[ app - compute ] , we prove an intriguing and useful connection between @xmath66 and the minimum distances between the kraus operators of @xmath46 and @xmath47 as @xmath67 where @xmath68 are the sets of all equivalent kraus representations of @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "this connection is particular useful in studying the scalings of the distance between quantum channels as we will show later .",
    "in which sense we call @xmath43 a fidelity function ? it turns out that @xmath69 $ ] . to see this , it is proved in the supplemental material of ref .",

    "from this relationship it is also immediate clear that @xmath43 is stable , i.e. , @xmath71 .",
    "this result gives an operational meaning to @xmath72 .",
    "we emphasize that although we made connections between @xmath43 and the minimum fidelity of the output states , @xmath43 is defined directly on quantum channels and does not depend on the states .",
    "the definition and the operational meaning of @xmath43 play distinct roles in applications , the operational meaning provides a physical picture while the direct definition brings insights which enable or ease the proofs and computations , which will be demonstrated in the applications .",
    "this is in analogy to how fidelity of quantum states is connected to the classical fidelity @xmath73 , here @xmath74 denotes the classical fidelity with @xmath75 and @xmath76 , @xmath77 denotes a set of positive operator valued measurements(povm)@xcite , here similarly the fidelity between quantum states has the operational meaning as the minimum classical fidelity , however the fidelity between quantum states is defined directly on quantum states which is independent of the measurements and such direct definition has provided numerous insights which would be hindered with just the classical fidelity .",
    "it is known that the trace distance and the fidelity between quantum states have the following relationships@xcite @xmath78 from which it is straightforward to get the relationships between the diamond norm and the fidelity of quantum channels .",
    "this can be obtained by substituting @xmath79 and @xmath80 , then optimizing over @xmath2 @xmath81&\\leq \\max_{\\rho_{sa}}\\frac{1}{2}\\|k_1\\otimes i_a(\\rho_{sa})-k_2\\otimes i_a(\\rho_{sa})\\|_1\\\\ & \\leq \\max_{\\rho_{sa}}\\sqrt{1-f_s^2[k_1\\otimes i_a(\\rho_{sa}),k_2\\otimes i_a(\\rho_{sa } ) ] } , \\endaligned\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which gives @xmath82 since @xmath43 can be computed directly from the kraus operators , this also provides a way to bound the diamond norm using the kraus operators .",
    "in @xcite the choi matrices of the quantum channels are used to compute the fidelity between the channels , which corresponds to the fidelity between the output states of two quantum channels when the input state is taken as the maximal entangled state . as the maximal entangled state is in general",
    "not the optimal input state , the fidelity thus defined does not have operational meaning as the minimum fidelity of the output states , thus can not be related to the ultimate precision limit in quantum metrology etc(instead related to the precision limit when the probe state is taken as the maximally entangled state ) .",
    "next we demonstrate the applications in quantum information science , in particular we show how the fidelity provides a unified platform for the ultimate precision in quantum metrology and the minimum number of uses needed for perfect channel discrimination .",
    "the task of quantum metrology , or quantum parameter estimation in general , is to estimate a parameter @xmath83 encoded in some channel @xmath84 , this can be achieved by preparing a quantum state @xmath2 and let it go through the extended channel @xmath85 with the output state @xmath86 . by performing povm , @xmath87 , on @xmath88 one gets the measurement result @xmath89 with probability @xmath90 .",

    "intuitively , this ultimate precision limit should be quantified by the distance between @xmath84 and its infinitesimal neighboring channel @xmath109 , in a way analogous to how bures distance of quantum states quantifies the precision limit of estimating @xmath83 from the state @xmath88@xcite .",
    "however although much progress has been made on calculating the ultimate precision limit@xcite , such a clear physical picture has still not been established after more than two decades since braunstein and caves s seminal paper@xcite , this is mainly due to the lack of proper tools on quantum channels . here",
    "we show that the fidelity between quantum channels can be used to establish such a physical picture , which also leads naturally to a new fisher information on quantum channel .",

    "any measurements that are used in the control can be substituted by controlled unitaries with ancillary systems , the controls interspersed between the channels can thus be taken as unitaries , which is shown in fig.[fig : seqsupp ] .",
