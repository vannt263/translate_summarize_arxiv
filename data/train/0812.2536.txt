    "we have investigated quark - pair production and determined particle spectra in time - dependent external u(1 ) and su(2 ) chromo - electric fields  @xcite . in this paper , we describe strange and charm quark - pair production , and make a calculations of corresponding suppression factors for su(2 ) gauge field .",
    "the results of solving similar problem for u(1 ) gauge field can be found in  @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach , that takes into account space inhomogeneities , was considered in  @xcite .",
    "however , it is worthwhile to mention that in contrast to the main idea of  @xcite , where pairs production is directly calculated by numerical integration of a dirac equation , our approach based on solving a kinetic equation for an `` observable '' wigner function ( or , finally , distribution function ) providing to a considerable extent an intuitive insight to the physical problem . the next advantage of the current approach that it is not so highly computer demanded , thus allows to obtain detailed information about created particles .",

    "the particle production happens during the whole evolution of the field .",
    "in contrast to this , for long pulse , the number densities of produced charm quark - pairs becomes negligible in the final state , because charm - pair production is balanced by subsequent absorption by the field .",
    "this dependence on the pulse width is also demonstrated on the right panel of fig .",
    "this figure clearly displays that charm quark - pair production is substantially enhanced in the cases of short pulse widths , and this enhancement has a maximum at @xmath53 . in opposite to the heavy charm quark ,",

    "[ gamma ] summarizes our results . on the left panel",
    "the dependence on the pulse width is displayed .",
    "the strange to light ratio has a weak dependence on the pulse width , its value is approaching slowly the asymptotic value of schwinger limit ( 0.84 ) from below , similarly to u(1 ) gauge field  @xcite . for charm quark",
    "this schwinger limit is negligibly small , which value is reproduced by our numerical calculation for very long pulse width . on the other hand , at short pulse widths , the relative charm production is surprisingly large , which does not follow any earlier expectation .",
    "considering charm to light and charm to strange ratios , only a slight difference can be seen between them .",
    "on the right panel we display the quark mass dependence of the suppression factor for different pulse widths . for short pulse width",
    "the suppression factor is decreasing almost linearly with increasing quark mass value . for large pulse widths we can see a very fast ( @xmath54 ) drop , which is consistent with the schwinger formula .",
    "we have calculated light , strange and charm quark - pair production in time - dependent su(2 ) non - abelian field . applying a pulse - like time evolution and investigating the influence of pulse width , we observed that light and strange quark - pairs are produced as we expected , approaching the schwinger limit .",
    "charm quark - pairs followed this behaviour for large pulse widths .",
    "however , for short pulses we did not see the expected charm suppression , connected to the large charm quark mass . indeed , the large value of inverse temporal width of the pulse , overwhelming the mass of the heavy quark , @xmath55 , determines the quark - pair production .",
    "this finding could indicate the formation of collective gluon field via enhanced heavy quark - pair production at rhic .",
    "the issue of quantitative calculation of particle suppression factors for different quarks and comparison with the existing models will be addressed elsewhere .",
