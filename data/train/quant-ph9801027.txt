    "in 1982 feynman pointed out that it appears to be impossible to efficiently simulate the behaviour of a quantum mechanical system with a computer@xcite .",
    "this problem arises because the quantum system is not confined to its eigenstates , but can exist in any superposition of them , and so the space needed to describe the system is very large . to take a simple example , a system comprising @xmath0 two level sub - systems , such as @xmath0 spin - particles , inhabits a hilbert space of dimension @xmath1 , and evolves under a series of transformations described by matrices containing @xmath2 elements . for this reason it is impractical to simulate the behaviour of spin systems containing more than about a dozen spins .",
    "the difficulty of simulating quantum systems using classical computers suggests that quantum systems have an information processing capability much greater than that of corresponding classical systems .",
    "thus it might be possible to build quantum mechanical computers@xcite which utilise this information processing capability in an effective way to achieve a computing power well beyond that of a classical computer . such a quantum computer could be used to efficiently simulate other quantum mechanical systems@xcite , or to solve conventional mathematical problems@xcite which suffer from a similar exponential growth in complexity , such as factoring@xcite .",
    "considerable progress in this direction has been made in recent years .",
    "the basic logic elements necessary to carry out quantum computing are well understood , and quantum algorithms have been developed , both for simple demonstration problems@xcite and for more substantial problems such as factoring@xcite .",
    "experimental implementation of a quantum computer has , however , proved difficult .",
    "much effort has been directed towards implementing quantum computers using ions trapped by electric and magnetic fields@xcite , and while this approach has shown some success@xcite , it has proved difficult to progress beyond computers containing a single two - level system ( corresponding to a single quantum bit , or qubit ) .",
    "recently two separate approaches have been described@xcite for the implementation of a quantum computer using nuclear magnetic resonance@xcite ( nmr ) .",
    "these approaches shows great promise as it has proved relatively simple to investigate quantum systems containing two or three qubits@xcite .",
    "here we describe our implementation of a simple quantum algorithm for solving deutsch s problem,@xcite on a two qubit nmr quantum computer .",
    "all current implementations of quantum computers are built up from a small number of basic elements .",
    "the first of these is the qubit , which plays the same role as that of the bit in a classical computer .",
    "a classical bit can be in one of two states , @xmath3 or @xmath4 , and similarly a qubit can be represented by any two level system with eigenstates labelled and .",
    "one obvious implementation is to use the two zeeman levels of a spin-  particle in a magnetic field , and we shall assume this implementation throughout the rest of this paper . unlike a bit , however , a qubit is not confined to these two eigenstates , but can in general exist in some superposition of the two states .",
    "it is this ability to exist in superpositions which makes quantum systems so difficult to simulate and which gives quantum computers their power .",
    "the second requirement is a set of logic gates , corresponding to gates such as and , or and not in conventional computers.@xcite quantum gates differ from their classical counterparts in one very important way : they must be reversible@xcite .",
    "this is because the evolution of any quantum system can be described by a series of unitary transformations , which are themselves reversible .",
    "this need for reversibility has many consequences for the design of quantum gates .",
    "clearly for a gate to be reversible it must be possible to reconstruct the input bits knowing only the design of the gate and the output bits , and so every input bit must be in some sense preserved in the outputs .",
    "one trivial consequence of this is that the gate must have exactly as many outputs as inputs .",
    "for this reason it is obvious that gates such as and and or are not reversible .",
    "it is , however , possible to construct reversible equivalents of and and or , in which the input bits are preserved .",
    "just as it can be shown that one or more gates ( such as the nand gate ) are universal for classical computing@xcite ( that is , any classical gate can be constructed using only wires and nand gates ) , it can be shown that certain gates or combinations of gates are universal for quantum computing .",
    "in particular it can be shown@xcite that the combination of a general single qubit rotation with the two bit `` controlled - not '' gate ( cnot ) is universal .",
    "furthermore it is possible to build a reversible equivalent of the nand gate , and thus to implement any classical logic operation using reversible logic .",
    "single qubit rotations are easily implemented in nmr as they correspond to rotations within the subspace corresponding to a single spin , and such rotations can be achieved using radio frequency ( rf ) fields .",
    "one particularly important single bit gate is the hadamard gate , which performs the rotational transformation @xmath5 the hadamard operator can thus be used to convert eigenstates into superpositions of states .",
    "similarly , as the hadamard is self - inverse , it can be used to convert superpositions of states back into eigenstates for later analysis .",
    "two - bit gates correspond to rotations within subspaces corresponding to two spins , and thus require some kind of spin ",
    "spin interaction for their implementation . in nmr",
    "the scalar spin ",
    "spin coupling ( j - coupling ) has the correct form , and is ideally suited for the construction of controlled gates , such as cnot .",
    "this gate operates to invert the value of one qubit when another qubit ( the control qubit ) has some specified value , usually ; its truth table is shown in table  [ table : cnot ] .",
    ".the truth table for the cnot gate .",
    "the first qubit ( the control qubit ) is unchanged by the gate , while the second qubit is flipped if the control qubit is in state 1 , effectively implementing an xor gate .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     these four functions can be divided into two groups : the two `` constant '' functions , for which @xmath6 is independent of @xmath7 ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , and the two `` balanced '' functions , for which @xmath6 is zero for one value of @xmath7 and unity for the other ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "given some unknown function @xmath12 ( known to be one of these four functions ) , it is possible to determine which of the four functions it is by applying @xmath12 to two known inputs : @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this procedure also provides enough information to determine whether the function is constant or balanced .",
    "however knowing whether the function is constant or balanced corresponds to only one bit of information , and so it might be possible to answer this question using only one evaluation of the function @xmath12 .",
    "equivalently , it might be possible to determine the value of @xmath13 using only one evaluation of @xmath12 .",
    "( the symbol @xmath14 indicates addition modulo @xmath15 , and for two one bit numbers , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 equals @xmath3 if @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the same , and @xmath4 if they are different . ) in fact this can be achieved as long as the calculation is performed using a quantum computer rather than a classical one .    quantum computers of necessity use reversible logic , and",
    "so it is not possible to implement the binary function @xmath12 directly .",
    "it is , however , possible to design a propagator , @xmath19 , which captures @xmath12 within a reversible transformation by using a system with two input qubits and two output qubits as follows @xmath20 the two input bits are preserved ( @xmath7 is preserved directly , while @xmath21 is preserved by combining it with @xmath6 , the desired result ) , and so @xmath19 corresponds to a reversible transformation . note that for any one bit number @xmath16 , @xmath22 , and so values of @xmath6 can be determined by setting the second input bit to @xmath3 . using this propagator and appropriate input states it is possible to evaluate @xmath23 and @xmath24 using @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    "the approach outlined above , in which the state of a quantum computer is described explicitly , swiftly becomes unwieldy , and it is useful to use more compact notations .",
    "one particularly simple approach is to use quantum circuits,@xcite which may be drawn by analogy with classical electronic circuits . in this approach lines",
    "are used to represent `` wires '' down which qubits `` flow '' , while boxes represent quantum gates which perform appropriate unitary transformations .",
    "for example , the analysis of @xmath12 can be summarised by the circuit shown in figure  [ fig : cf ] .",

    "however , it is not necessary to start with the system in some eigenstate ; instead it is possible to begin with a superposition of states .",
    "suppose the calculation begins with the second qubit in the superposition @xmath27 .",
    "then @xmath28 ( we have used the fact that @xmath22 , as before , while @xmath29 if @xmath30 and @xmath3 if @xmath31 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath6 is now encoded in the overall phase of the result , with the qubits left otherwise unchanged . while this is not particularly useful , suppose the calculation begins with the first qubit also in a superposition of states , namely @xmath32 .",
    "then@xcite @xmath33 with the first qubit ending up in the superposition @xmath34 , with the desired answer ( @xmath13 ) encoded as the _ relative _ phase of the two states contributing to the superposition .",
    "this relative phase can be measured , and so the value of @xmath13 ( that is , whether @xmath12 is constant or balanced ) has been determined using only one application of the propagator @xmath19 , that is only one evaluation of the function @xmath12 .",
    "this approach can be easily implemented using a quantum circuit , as shown in figure  [ fig : cd ] .",
    "( 210,100 ) ( 15,70)(0,0)[r ] ( 20,70)(1,0)20 ( 40,60)(20,20)@xmath35 ( 60,70)(1,0)20 ( 15,30)(0,0)[r ] ( 20,30)(1,0)20 ( 40,20)(20,20)@xmath35 ( 60,30)(1,0)20 ( 80,20)(20,60)@xmath19 ( 100,70)(1,0)20 ( 120,60)(20,20)@xmath35 ( 140,70)(1,0)20 ( 165,70)(0,0)[l ] ( 100,30)(1,0)20 ( 120,20)(20,20)@xmath35 ( 140,30)(1,0)20 ( 165,30)(0,0)[l ]    this circuit starts off from appropriate eigenstates , uses hadamard transformations to convert these into superpositions , applies the propagator @xmath19 to these superpositions , and finally use another pair of hadamard transforms to convert the superpositions back into eigenstates which encode the desired result .",
    "the deutsch algorithm can be implemented on a quantum computer with two qubits , such as an nmr quantum computer based on two coupled spins .",
    "first it is necessary to show that the individual components of the quantum circuit can be built .",
    "it is convenient to begin by writing down the necessary states and operators using the product operator basis set@xcite normally used in describing nmr experiments ( this basis is formed by taking outer products between pauli matrices describing the individual spins , together with the scaled unit matrix , @xmath36 ) .",
    "the initial state , @xmath37 , can be written as a vector in hilbert space , @xmath38 but this description is not really appropriate .",
    "unlike other implementations , an nmr quantum computer comprises not just a single set of spins but rather an ensemble of spins in a statistical mixture of states .",
    "such a system is most conveniently treated using a density matrix , which can describe either a mixture or a pure state ; for example @xmath39 this density matrix can be decomposed in the product operator basis as @xmath40 . ignoring multiples of the unit matrix ( which give rise to no observable effects in any nmr experiment )",
    "this can be reached from the thermal equilibrium density matrix ( @xmath41 ) by a series of rf and field gradient pulses@xcite .",
    "the unitary transformation matrix corresponding to the hadamard operator on a single spin can be written as @xmath42 this corresponds to a @xmath43 rotation around an axis tilted at @xmath44 between the @xmath45 and @xmath7-axes .",
    "such a rotation can be achieved directly using an off resonance pulse,@xcite or using a three pulse sandwich@xcite such as @xmath46 .",
    "even more simply the hadamard can be approximated by a @xmath47 pulse .",
    "while this is clearly not a true hadamard operator ( for example , it is not self inverse ) , its behaviour is similar and it can be used in some cases : for example , it is possible to replace the first pair of hadamard gates in the circuit for the deutsch algorithm ( figure  [ fig : cd ] ) by @xmath47 pulses and the second pair of gates by @xmath48 pulses .",
    "clearly it is possible to apply the hadamard operator either to just one of the two spins ( using selective soft rf pulses@xcite ) or to both spins simultaneously ( using non - selective hard pulses ) .    the unitary transformations corresponding to the four possible propagators @xmath19 are also easily derived .",
    "each propagator corresponds to flipping the state of the second qubit under certain conditions as follows : @xmath49 , never flip the second qubit ; @xmath50 , flip the second qubit when the first qubit is in state one ; @xmath51 , flip the second qubit when the first qubit is in state zero ; @xmath52 , always flip the second qubit .",
    "the first and last cases are particularly simple , as @xmath49 corresponds to doing nothing ( the identity operation ) , while @xmath52 corresponds to inverting the second spin ( a conventional not gate , or , equivalently , a @xmath43 pulse ) .",
    "the second and third propagators correspond to controlled - not gates , which can be implemented using spin  spin couplings .",
    "for example @xmath50 is described by the matrix @xmath53 which can be achieved using the pulse sequence @xmath54 where @xmath55 indicates a @xmath56 pulse on the second spin , _ couple _ indicates evolution under the scalar coupling hamiltonian , @xmath57 , for a time @xmath58 , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 indicate either periods of free precession under zeeman hamiltonians or the application of composite @xmath45-pulses.@xcite similarly @xmath51 can be achieved using the pulse sequence @xmath61    the pulse sequences described above can be implemented in many different ways , as different composite @xmath45-pulses can be used , the order of some of the pulses can be varied , and in some cases different pulses can be combined together .",
    "we chose to use the implementation @xmath62 where pulses not marked as either @xmath63 or @xmath64 were applied to both nuclei .",
    "the phase of the final pulse distinguishes @xmath50 ( for which the final pulse is @xmath65 ) from @xmath51 ( for which it is @xmath66 ) .",
    "finally it is necessary to consider analysis of the final state , which could in general be one of the four states @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , or @xmath70 . in order to distinguish these states",
    "it is necessary to apply a @xmath47 pulse and observe the nmr spectrum .",
    "the final nmr signal observed from spin @xmath63 is @xmath71 if the spin is in state @xmath3 , and @xmath72 if it is in state @xmath4 . for a computer implementing the deutsch algorithm",
    "the final detection @xmath47 pulses cancel out the two final pseudo - hadamard @xmath48 pulses , and thus all four pulses can be omitted ( see figure  [ fig : cdnmr ] ) .",

    "hence it is simple to determine the value of @xmath13 ( that is , determine whether the function is constant or balanced ) by determining the relative phase of the signals from the two spins .",
    "in order to demonstrate the results described above , we have constructed an nmr quantum computer capable of implementing the deutsch algorithm . for our two - spin system",
    "we chose to use a @xmath79 solution of the pyrimidine base cytosine in @xmath80 ; rapid exchange of the two amine protons and the single amide proton with the deuterated solvent leaves two remaining protons forming an isolated two - spin system .",

    "the observed j - coupling between the two protons was , while the difference in resonance frequencies was .",
    "selective excitation was achieved using gaussian@xcite soft pulses incorporating a phase ramp@xcite to allow excitation away from the transmitter frequency . during a selective pulse",
    "the other ( unexcited ) spin continues to experience the main zeeman interaction , resulting in a rotation around the @xmath45-axis , but the length of the selective pulses can be chosen such that the net rotation experienced by the other spin is zero .",
    "the residual hod resonance was suppressed by low power saturation during the relaxation delays .",
    "this system can be used both for the implementation of classical algorithms to analyse @xmath23 and @xmath24 and for the implementation of the deutsch algorithm ; as shown in figure  [ fig : cdnmr ] the pulse sequences differ only in the placement of the @xmath47 pulses .",
    "the results for the classical algorithm to determine @xmath23 are shown in figure  [ fig : rf0 ] .",
    "the lefthand pair of signals corresponds to the first spin ( @xmath63 ) , while the pair on the right hand side correspond to the second spin ( @xmath64 ) ; the ( barely visible ) splitting in each pair arises from the scalar coupling @xmath83 . in this experiment",
    "the value of @xmath23 is determined by setting both spins @xmath63 and @xmath64 into state , performing the calculation , and then measuring the final state of spin @xmath64 ; spin @xmath63 should not be affected , and so should remain in state .",
    "the phase of the reference spectrum ( a ) was adjusted so that signals from spin @xmath63 appear in absorption , and the same phase correction was applied to the other three spectra .",
    "the state of a spin after a calculation can then be determined by determining whether the corresponding signals in the spectrum are in absorption ( state ) or emission ( state ) .",
    "as expected spin @xmath63 does indeed remain in state , while the value of @xmath23 ( determined from spin @xmath64 ) is @xmath3 for @xmath84 and @xmath85 but @xmath4 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "clearly our nmr quantum computer is capable of implementing this classical algorithm , as it is simple to determine @xmath23 .",
    "the other value , @xmath24 , can be determined in a very similar way ( see figure  [ fig : rf1 ] ) .",
    "in this case spin @xmath63 remains in state , while @xmath24 equals @xmath3 for @xmath84 and @xmath86 and equals @xmath4 for @xmath85 and @xmath87 .",
    "there are , however , several imperfections visible in the results .    first , the signals are not perfectly phased : rather than exhibiting pure absorption or pure emission lineshapes the signals have more complex shapes , including dispersive components .",
    "these arise from the difficulty of implementing perfect selective pulses , which effect the desired rotation at one spin while leaving the other spin entirely unaffected .",
    "similarly the selective pulses will not perfectly suppress j - couplings during the excitation , leading to the appearance of antiphase contributions to the lineshape .",
    "any practical selective pulse will be imperfect , and so will result in systematic distortions in the final result .",
    "note that these distortions are most severe in cases ( b ) and ( c ) , where the propagator is complex , containing a large number of selective pulses .",
    "interestingly the distortions are also more severe for the measurement of @xmath23 ( figure  [ fig : rf0 ] ) than for @xmath24 ( figure  [ fig : rf1 ] ) ; there is no simple explanation for this effect , which is due to the complex interplay of many selective pulses .",
    "we are currently seeking ways to minimise these effects .",
    "secondly , the signal intensities vary in different cases ; as before the signal loss is most severe in cases ( b ) and ( c ) , corresponding to complex propagators .",
    "this is in part a consequence of imperfect selective pulses , as discussed above , but may also indicate the effects of spin relaxation , that is decoherence of the states involved in the calculation .",
    "decoherence is a fundamental problem , and may ultimately limit the size of practical quantum computers,@xcite although a variety of error correction techniques@xcite have been devised to overcome it .",
    "these imperfections are not a major problem in our nmr quantum computer , as it is still easy to determine the state of a spin .",
    "however our computer is small , and the programs run on it are short ( that is , they contain a small number of logic gates ) ; if more complex programs are to be run on larger computers then these imperfections must be addressed .",
    "the results of implementing the deutsch quantum algorithm are shown in figure  [ fig : rd ] .    in this case",

    "once again a number of imperfections are visible , though in this case they appear to be most severe in the case of @xmath87 .",
    "we have demonstrated that the isolated pair of nuclei in partially deuterated cytosine can be used to implement a two qubit nmr quantum computer .",
    "this computer can be used to run both classical algorithms and quantum algorithms , such as that for solving deutsch s problem ( distinguishing between constant and balanced functions ) .",
