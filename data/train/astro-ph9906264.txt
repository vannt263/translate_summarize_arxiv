    "water is one of the most abundant molecules in the atmosphere of late m - giants , and it is a dominant absorber in the near - infrared ( near - ir ) region .",
    "water vapor in stellar atmospheres has been studied by theoretical and observational methods .",
    "the strength of the h@xmath0o absorption possibly correlates with the spectral type , the effective temperature of the star , and the near - ir color ( kleinmann & hall @xcite ; lanon & rocca - volmerange @xcite ) , even though such correlations were not clearly found by hyland ( @xcite ) . according to spinrad & wing ( @xcite ) and hyland ( @xcite ) ,",
    "h@xmath0o could only be detected in giants with spectral type m6 or later .",
    "this was consistent with hydrostatic models of the atmosphere of red - giants ( tsuji @xcite ; scargle & strecker @xcite ) .",
    "as a further complication , most late m - giants are long period variables , and in general , the band strength of the h@xmath0o absorption features depends on stellar variability .",
    "for example , mira variables show very deep h@xmath0o absorption , and the depths of h@xmath0o features in miras vary from phase to phase ( hyland @xcite ) .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopic observations of the mira variable r  leo by hinkle & barnes ( @xcite ) revealed that a significant fraction of the h@xmath0o molecules were in a component with a distinct velocity , and a cooler excitation temperature than molecules near the photosphere .",
    "they interpreted this ` cool component ' as an overlying layer above the photosphere .",
    "these previous studies were mostly based on ground or airborne observations , where the terrestrial h@xmath0o interferes with a detailed study of the center of the stellar water bands .",
    "in contrast , observations from space are ideal for investigations of stellar h@xmath0o features . using the infrared space observatory ( iso ) , tsuji et al .",
    "( @xcite ) discovered a weak h@xmath0o absorption in the early m - type star , ( m2.5ii - iii ) .",
    "they argued that the observed h@xmath0o is in a ` warm molecular layer ' above the photosphere .    in this paper",
    ", we present the results of a study of h@xmath0o absorption features , using data from the infrared telescope in space ( irts , murakami et al . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this study is based on data from the two grating spectrometers onboard the irts : the near - infrared spectrometer ( nirs ) , and the mid - infrared spectrometer ( mirs ) .",
    "the irts was launched in march 1995 , and it surveyed about 7% of the sky with four instruments during its 26 day mission . the nirs covers the wavelength region from 1.43 to 2.54 and from 2.88 to 3.98  @xmath4 m in 24 channels with a spectral resolution for point sources of @xmath5  @xmath4 m .",
    "the mirs covers the range from 4.5 to 11.7  @xmath4 m in 32 channels with a resolution of @xmath6 m .",
    "both spectrometers have a rectangular entrance aperture of @xmath7 .",
    "the total number of detected point sources is about 50,000 for the nirs ( freund et al .",
    "@xcite ) and about 1,000 for the mirs ( yamamura et al .",
    "the estimated absolute calibration errors are 5% for the nirs , and 10% for the mirs .",
    "this may cause systematic errors in the colors and the h@xmath0o index discussed in this paper .",
    "the spectra are not color corrected .",
    "all stars used in this study were observed both by the nirs and the mirs between april 9 and 24 .",
    "we only include stars at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath8 ) in this sample , to minimize source confusion and interstellar extinction .",
    "each selected star has a unique association with the iras point source catalog ( psc , @xcite ) , within 8@xmath9 from the nominal nirs position , and each associated psc entry has reliable 12 and 25  @xmath4 m band fluxes ( fqual@xmath103 ; iras explanatory supplement @xcite ) .",
    "known carbon and s - type stars ( stephenson @xcite , @xcite ) , as well as non - stellar objects were discarded from the sample .",
    "the current sample contains 108 stars .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio for all stars is larger than 5 in all nirs bands .    of the 108 stars used in this study",
    ", 43 have a unique association in the bright star catalogue ( bsc , hoffleit & jaschek @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution of spectral types for these 43 stars are : 1  b , 2  f , 4  g , 22  k , and 14  m - types .",
    "a total of 31 m - giants are found in the general catalogue of variable stars ( gcvs , kholopov et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and the distribution of variable types in the gcvs is as follows : 10 miras , 13 semi - regulars ( sr , sra or srb , hereafter sr ) , and 8 irregulars ( l or lb , hereafter l ) . no m - dwarfs or m - supergiants were found in the bsc or the gcvs associations .",
    "in fig .  [ spec ] , we show the composite spectra of six representative m - giants observed by the nirs and the mirs . we indicate the position of the molecular absorption features due to co ( 1.4 , 2.3 , 4.6  @xmath4 m ) , h@xmath0o ( 1.5 , 1.9 , 2.7 , 6.2  @xmath4 m ) , and sio ( 8.2  @xmath4 m ) .",

    "the h@xmath0o bands at 1.9 and 2.7  @xmath4 m are visible in two early m - giants , ( m2 , lb ) and ( m5 , srb ) , where no h@xmath0o in the photosphere was expected to be detectable .",
    "one could argue that the early m - type stars with h@xmath0o absorption had spectral types later than m6 at the time of observation , because of their variability .",
    "however , this is not the case .",
    "we can estimate the spectral types , using the relation between the spectral type and color ( bessell & brett @xcite ) .",
    "we use the color @xmath11 instead of the photometric color @xmath12 , where @xmath11 is defined as : @xmath13 @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the irts / nirs fluxes at 2.2 and 1.7  @xmath4 m in units of jy , respectively . for the nirs wavelength region ,",

    "one m9 star ( @xmath10 ) deviates from this relation , but we regard this star as m5 , according to abt ( @xcite ) .    all stars of spectral type m6 and later are above @xmath16 .",
    "thus , stars bluer than @xmath17 are expected to have spectral types earlier than m6 .",

    "these numbers confirm that these 2 stars have spectral types earlier than m6 at the time of the irts observation , even though both stars show clear h@xmath0o absorption .",
    "we now discuss the relationship between the h@xmath0o absorption strength and the spectral type . for this , we define the h@xmath0o index @xmath22 as follows : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the continuum flux level at 1.9  @xmath4 m in units of jy , which is evaluated by linear interpolation between @xmath15 and @xmath14 .",

    "the stars above the @xmath31 are supposed to be stars with h@xmath0o absorptions .",
    "there are 6 such stars in the region of @xmath18  m6 .",

    "furthermore , there is a clear correlation between @xmath22 and @xmath38 , which implies that the h@xmath0o absorption is related to the circumstellar dust emission .",

    "@xcite ) , which is about a factor of 10100 larger than those expected for ls and srs ( @xmath51@xmath52 , jura & kleinmann @xcite ) .",

    "( @xcite ) and hinkle & barnes ( @xcite ) , we conclude that they are in an outer atmosphere , i.e. the layer above the photosphere , but below the circumstellar envelope .",

    "hinkle & barnes ( @xcite ) found that in miras the h@xmath0o in an outer layer is responsible for the near - ir absorption , and we find the same situation in some early m - type stars .",
