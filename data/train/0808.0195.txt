    "2007 )    the nfw density profile is a source of an ongoing controversy  its universality in the numerical pure dm models is in apparent contradiction with at least some of the observations of disk galaxies and galaxy clusters , which exhibit rather flat density cores ( e.g. , flores & primack 1994 ; kravtsov et al . 1998 ; salucci & burkert 2000 ; sand et al .",

    "early arguments about change of the central density profile claimed that baryons drag dm in the so - called adiabatic contraction , steepening the dm density slope ( e.g. , blumenthal et al . 1986 ) .",
    "however , they have neglected the clumpy nature of the accreting material in the assembling halo , which can give rise to clump - background dynamical friction and energy transfer from the clumps to the background . the ability of baryons to radiate their internal energy increases the binding energy and acts as a ` glue ' on the dm substructure ( el - zant et al .",
    "el - zant et al . have used the monte - carlo technique to calculate the leveling of the nfw cusp in the presence of such clumps and found this process to be efficient over @xmath15  gyr .",
    "the initial conditions presumed the existence of a nfw cusp , a spherically - symmetric dm halo and indestructible clumps .",
    "the nfw cusp is characterized by the  temperature \" ( i.e. , dm dispersion velocities ) inversion which makes it thermodynamically improbable but dynamically stable in the absence of energy transfer mechanism ( el - zant et al .",
    "dynamical friction of sufficiently bound clumps can trigger such energy flux into the cusp , increasing its dispersion velocities and washing it out .",
    "el - zant et al . found that the necessary condition for the dynamical friction to have an effect is the aggregation of mass into the clumps more massive than @xmath16 of the dm halo  result confirmed for the galaxy clusters as well ( el - zant et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in fully self - consistent numerical simulations with baryons ,",
    "the question is whether the nfw cusp forms in the first place .",
    "such simulations have been either limited to high redshifts ( @xmath17 , gnedin et al .",
    "2004 ) or focused on the adiabatic contraction and had an insufficient resolution ( gustafsson et al .",
    "they have verified that baryons lead to a steeper dm density profile than the nfw cusp , but left open its subsequent evolution .",

    "it was imposed on a @xmath41 grid and predicted to collapse by @xmath42 by the top - hat model .",
    "this perturbation is embedded in a region ( 2nd constraint ) corresponding to @xmath43 in which the over - density is zero , i.e. , the unperturbed universe .",
    "the random component of the cr introduces density perturbations on all scales , thus leading to major mergers ( romano - daz et al .",

    "we have randomly replaced 1/6 of dm particles by equal mass sph particles .",
    "hence , @xmath45 is not affected .",
    "two models analyzed here are those of a pure dm ( hereafter pdm ) and dm@xmath0baryons ( bdm ) . evolution of dm density profiles for both models is shown in fig .  1 at various redshifts and in three different ways : as @xmath46 _ per se _ , factored by @xmath47 , and by @xmath48 , in order to emphasize the @xmath2 and @xmath3 cusps .",
    "at early redshifts , @xmath49 , the dm density profiles of both models are nearly identical . with time , the bdm halo becomes more cuspy  the dm experiencing the adiabatic contraction by baryons .",
    "this region of higher density extends gradually to larger @xmath47 , up to @xmath50  kpc at @xmath51 . between @xmath52 and 1",

    "hence over prolonged time period , while the pdm model displays the nfw cusp , the dm in the bdm model remarkably forms an isothermal cusp , down to the central kpc , i.e. , to @xmath56 .",
    "the isothermal cusp in the bdm model is gradually erased inside @xmath57  kpc after @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , within the central 3  kpc it becomes flatter than @xmath5 , i.e. , flatter than the nfw cusp , as seen in all three frames of fig .  1 , and within @xmath6  kpc forms a rather flat core . at @xmath51 ,",

    "the inner 200  kpc of halos are shown .",
    "the vertical coordinate units are logarithmic . ]    furthermore , in the pdm model , the density around 1  kpc from the center stays virtually unchanged after @xmath62 .",
    "the baryonic model shows a somewhat different behavior .",
    "namely , it keeps the same dm density at 1  kpc between @xmath63 , which decays thereafter by a factor of @xmath64 .",
    "behavior of the velocity dispersions , @xmath65 , in both models mirrors that of the density .",
    "the nfw dm cusp in the pdm model forms early and is characterized by the ` temperature ' inversion as shown in fig .  2 , where we display the @xmath7 evolution of the dm dispersion velocities",
    "( see also el - zant et al .",
    "in contrast , the bdm model shows a cuspy distribution of @xmath66 , which after @xmath52 can be approximated well by a single power law , @xmath67 inside central 10  kpc .",
    "the evolution of @xmath68 is shown in fig .  3 for both models .",
    "it is steadily increasing in the pdm model until the end of the major mergers epoch at @xmath69 , where it levels off .",
    "the bdm model shows a similar increase in @xmath68 , but well beyond the mergers epoch , until @xmath70 , where it sharply declines .",
    "this decline in @xmath71 is crucial in understanding the fate of the density cusp , as we discuss below .     in the pdm ( blue solid ) and",
    "bdm ( dashed red ) models .",
    "@xmath71 is calculated by fitting a power law @xmath72 between 1  kpc and 10  kpc .",
    "note that @xmath73 for bdm and @xmath74 for pdm models . ]",
    "we have performed a direct comparison between the dm halo evolution in the pure dm and baryonic models , from identical cosmological initial conditions .",
    "our goal is to understand the effect of the baryons on the dm density profile .",
    "we , therefore , focus on the dm evolution within the central region , quantify the cuspiness of the density distribution there , and attempt to relate its evolution to that of the dm substructure .",
    "our results show that the dm in the pdm model has established a nfw cusp early , and the only subsequent changes we observe are related to sudden increases in @xmath9  at the time of the major mergers ( e.g. , romano - daz et al . 2006 , 2007 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the baryonic ( bdm ) model goes through a two - step process : first , in the central @xmath75  kpc , the dm is dragged in by the baryons in what fits the adiabatic contraction ( e.g. , gnedin et al . 2004 ; gustafsson et al . 2006 ) .",
    "this stage is concurrent with the formation and growth of a galactic disk , but we did not verify whether the disk is solely responsible for the dm contraction .",
    "for an extended period of time , after @xmath52 , an isothermal cusp forms with @xmath76 and persists . in the next step ,",
    "the dm cusp is being gradually washed out from inside out , mainly after @xmath4 .",
    "by @xmath51 , the isothermal cusp is largely erased , and the density slope within the central 10  kpc is less steep than @xmath10 .",
    "in fact within the central @xmath64  kpc , it is less steep than the nfw slope of @xmath5 .",
    "we note , that the _ dm in the bdm model does not form the nfw cusp in the first place , but rather by - passes it in favor of an isothermal dm cusp which is subsequently washed out .",
    "_ for example , the ` temperature ' inversion characteristic of the nfw cusp is never observed in the bdm model ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "we first argue , that this leveling of the dm cusp is not a numerical artifact , i.e. , is not caused by a finite resolution of the code which is @xmath77  kpc . at this distance , softened and exact newtonian forces between point masses differ by 5%  this can not account for the observed changes in density profile further out .",
    "we also note that the dm density peak in the bdm model is occasionally offset from the baryonic peak by a few kpc , around @xmath4 and especially 0.4 , with the subhalos influx into the center , in what can be treated as @xmath78 instability .",
    "therefore , we have fitted the dm halo profile based on the position of the dm density peak at each frame .",
    "the cusp will be ` smeared ' if this procedure is not followed ( mcmillan & dehnen 2005 ) . also",
    ", the prime halo moves with respect to the center of mass of the computational sphere , this is related to the residual large - scale streaming motions in the dm ( romano - daz et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "next , we note that most of the cusp leveling happens after @xmath4 ( fig",
    "this correlates with a decrease in the slope of the central dispersion velocities ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the slope change in @xmath71 ( fig .  3 ) comes from the decrease in the central dispersion velocities around few kpc , while @xmath65 at @xmath80  kpc remains unchanged .",
    "what is the reason for this apparent ` cooling ' of the isothermal dm cusp ?",
    "any decrease in central @xmath65 of a dissipationless self - gravitationg entity in a virial equilibrium is counter - intuitive .",
    "it clearly has nothing to do with the major mergers , as this epoch ends at @xmath69 in our models .",
    "any subsequent _ smooth _ accretion of dissipative baryons will only increase @xmath65 as a result of the ongoing adiabatic contraction .",
    "however , if one considers accretion of _ clumpy _ baryons , which act as a ` glue ' on the dm subhalos where they reside , additional process of ` heating ' the dm by means of a dynamical friction becomes important .",
    "the heating rate is skewed to the density peak and will cause the dm to stream out of the cusp s gravitational well , eventually decreasing the ` temperature ' gradient at the center .",
    "fig .  3 displays this behavior of @xmath71 after it reaches its peak at @xmath70 . for a comparison ,",
    "the pdm halo shows a flat @xmath71 after the epoch of major mergers , for nearly 10  gyr .",
    "central region crossing by subhalos ( as well as accretion and tidal disruption ) continues to the present time",
    ". why do changes in the cusp become significant after @xmath4 ?",
    "4 displays the evolution of the subhalo population within the central 30  kpc of the bdm halo .",
    "we observe that at least in two instances , @xmath4 and 0.4 , there is a clear excess in the bdm subhalo population , corresponding to the splash in the subhalo influx rates .",
    "the number of these subhalos also exceeds that of the pdm by @xmath6 .",
    "the bdm subhalos appear in waves within the central region and these waves coinside with the dm streaming out of the center and ` cooling ' down .",
    "hence , the process of washing out the dm cusp correlates with the influx of subhalos into the innermost region of the bdm halo .",
    "we show elsewhere that waves of subhalos crossing the central region of the prime halo originate in the filament , cluster there and enter the prime halo before they merge among themselves .",
    "we find that the mass distribution of subhalos ( in the computational sphere ) with masses @xmath81 evolves with redshift  at high @xmath82 it can be approximated by a power law , @xmath83 , both in pdm and bdm models ( romano - diaz et al .",
    "but in the central virialized 100  kpc of the halo it evolves differently from the field subhalos . specifically , it is heavily skewed toward more massive ones after @xmath4 , while that of the pdm subhalos is only weakly so .",
    "this is significant , because the efficiency of dynamical friction increases substantially with the clump - to - prime halo virial mass ratio ( el - zant et al .",
    "2001 ) . at @xmath52 ,",
    "this ratio for the most massive subhalo residing within the virialized halo is @xmath84 . by @xmath4",
    "this ratio is @xmath85 , and at @xmath51 it is @xmath86  still higher than the minimum required by el - zant et al .",
    "the size of the obtained core in the dm distribution of the bdm model can be compared with observationally inferred cores .",
    "following salucci et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , for the virial mass of our halo at @xmath51 , @xmath87@xmath88 , the expected core is @xmath89  kpc .",
    "spano et al . ( 2008 ) lists a large range of core sizes , starting from @xmath90  kpc .",
    "both are compatible with the value obtained here .    in summary , we find that the dm density cusp corresponding to @xmath91 in the pdm model is leveled off by the action of subhalos in the presence of baryons in the bdm model .",
    "the energy feedback from stellar evolution has decayed by this time without any effect on the cusp .",
    "we do not detect the angular momentum ( @xmath92 ) transfer from the bar to the cusp  the latter @xmath92 stays constant in time .",
    "we also find that the bdm model forms a steeper isothermal rather than nfw - type cusp for extended time period .",
    "it goes through a two step process which involves gravitational contraction , followed by the influx of subhalos which heat up and dissolve the cusp .    our models , although containing about @xmath93 particles per halo , are still insufficient to fully resolve the formation of substructure around the prime halo .",
    "they should be viewed rather as a lower limit on the efficiency of the process reported here . neither is the process described here limited to low @xmath7  one can easily envision scenario(s ) when the subhalos act at intermediate and even high @xmath7 .",
    "overall , this work stands in agreement with gnedin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who stopped the simulation at redshift @xmath17 , well before the leveling of the density cusp",
    ". however , gustafsson et al . ( 2006 ) barely lacked resolution to detect the cusp behavior observed here .",
    "we have recently learned that j.p .",
    "ostriker ( priv",
    ". comm . ) obtained similar results on the cusp flattening ."
