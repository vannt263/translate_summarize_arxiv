    "in classical general relativity anisotropy has often played an important role from models of stellar structure and cosmologies to more exotic solutions @xcite-@xcite . in the category of exotic solutions exhibiting spherical symmetry",
    ", anisotropy is almost always present in systems such as wormholes , gravastars , and even certain black hole models forming from gravitational collapse or singularity - free models .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite - @xcite and references therein . )",
    "these sorts of anisotropic solutions usually involve strong gravity effects , and in some cases it may be argued that they are in the realm where effects from a quantum theory of gravitation should be considered . for example , the vicinity of the classical singularity formed during the gravitational collapse is almost certainly a domain where quantum gravity effects are expected to apply .",
    "more recently , bojowald , paily , reyes and tibrewala have performed a thorough , in - depth study of midisuperspace models containing horizons with scalar fields @xcite in order to study quantum effects in these space - times .    in the arena of non - trivial topologies , a common rationale for studying wormholes",
    "is that they may provide a simple model for the space - time foam , a potential model for the vacuum in theories of quantum gravity , where not only the geometry but also the topology of space - time may fluctuate due to quantum effects , @xcite , @xcite , as illustrated in figure [ fig : foam ] .",
    "it has been argued that systems of wormholes may provide good models for such a foam @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the vein of wormhole - like structures , there is good reason to study these systems utilizing the variables of loop quantum gravity due to their relevance in topology change which may exist in the quantum gravity realm . in the context of black hole physics ,",
    "topologically non - trivial horizons have already been studied within loop quantum gravity @xcite-@xcite .",
    "there have been a number works produced studying the possibility of a change in the topology of space - time at the classical and semi - classical level @xcite - @xcite .",
    "it is known that if one allows for the possibility of topology change in space - time , there are arguments that if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are distinct compact 3-manifolds , there will exist a space - time whose boundary is comprised of the disjoint union of @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite ( see figure [ fig : tc1 ] for reference . ) regarding this , geroch s theorem states that if a segment of space - time has @xmath0 and @xmath1 as boundaries possessing differing topology , then a singularity or closed time - like curves must exist somewhere on the manifold @xcite .",
    "it has been convincingly argued that these singularities that arise in certain topology changing space - times are extremely mild @xcite in the sense that the tetrad becomes degenerate ( introducing metric degeneracy ) but the resulting curvature remains well defined .",
    "the loop quantum gravity approach utilized here relies on _ densitized tetrads _ and su(2 ) connections , and it is known that solutions with classically degenerate metrics can yield finite equations when using these new ashtekar variables @xcite . therefore , even before implementing quantum corrections it is worthwhile using these alternate variables",
    "as they are better suited to study systems with non - trivial topology .",
    "in fact , it is possible that degenerate tetrads may play an important role in quantum gravity @xcite , @xcite .",
    "represent the critical point of the topology change , where quantum gravitation effects are expected to become important .",
    "this sort of topology change is thought to be ubiquitous at the planck scale . ]",
    "the cases for topology change or the existence of a space - time foam are still open .",
    "it is not yet completely clear if either of these are indeed possible or not .",
    "however , they are actually related issues as the existence of a space - time foam as a sea of fluctuating topologies is directly linked to the possibility of topology change . that is , if this picture of the space - time foam is correct , then topology change is allowed , at least in the quantum gravity realm .",
    "although we also can not answer this question definitively here , we do find that the existence of non - trivial topologies is less exotic when loop quantum corrections are present in the equations of motion , and hence this may be an indication that in the full loop - quantum gravity picture topology change would be at least more probable than in the classical regime . in wheeler - dewitt theory ,",
    "a study has also been performed by visser @xcite to determine whether the existence of non - trivial topologies is favored or not in that theory .    as well , the existence of wormholes in gravity theories which deviate from general relativity in the high curvature ( high energy ) realm are of interest to the wormhole community .",
    "of particular recent interest has been @xmath2 theory , where higher curvature scalar terms may appear in the gravitational lagrangian .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite . )",
    "wormholes have been studied in the @xmath2 theory @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the study in this article can be seen as another extension of general relativity to the high energy realm .",
    "specifically related to discerning effects from quantum gravity , some studies of wormholes within the paradigm of wheeler - dewitt theory have been carried out in @xcite , @xcite . as well , many authors have used classical higher derivative theories of gravity to capture some possible effects of high energy corrections to the general relativity solutions @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , some of which fall in the @xmath2 category mentioned above .",
    "others still have approached the problem by considering semi - classical gravity where the non - trivial topologies are supported by quantum matter @xcite - @xcite .",
    "given that the above solutions are necessarily anisotropic , we aim to study here inhomogeneous anisotropic systems .",
    "as most of the studies of such solutions have to date been classical , we also add some low - order loop quantum gravity holonomy corrections .",
    "we use a midi - superspace approach where we freeze the symmetry a priori to be spherical symmetry and then apply an `` effective quantization '' by replacing the configuration variable ( the su(2 ) connection ) with a function incorporating some holonomy corrections from the quantum theory .",
    "although we analyze anisotropic structures in general , we will pay special attention to the wormhole solutions , given the above arguments for their possible importance in quantum gravity .    regarding the possible detection of quantum gravity effects at the macroscopic level ,",
    "it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that one could imagine an extremely advanced civilization @xcite pulling a wormhole from this submicroscopic space - time quantum foam and enlarging it to macroscopic dimensions .",
    "however , in a more plausible scenario , the possibility that inflation might provide a natural mechanism for the enlargement of such wormholes to macroscopic size was explored @xcite .",
    "some authors have also investigated the effects of such a foamy space on the cosmological constant .",
    "one example is the coleman mechanism , where micro - wormhole contributions suppress the cosmological constant , explaining its small observed value @xcite .",
    "however , even in the absence of detectable effects , predictions of a quantum gravity theory are important for understanding physics at the planck scale @xcite .",
    "the basic variables in loop quantum gravity ( fixed to the time gauge ) are the su(2 ) connection as the configuration variable and the densitized triad as the conjugate momentum variable . in terms of more traditional variables in the 3 + 1 space - time decomposition , the densitized triad , @xmath3 , is directly related to the spatial three - metric , @xmath4 , via @xmath5 in this work we adopt the convention that indices @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , etc .",

    "to this set one adds the gauss constraint in order to eliminate redundant degrees of freedom from internal rotations : @xmath27    the formal quantization occurs by replacing the `` classical functions '' @xmath28 and @xmath3 in ( [ eq : vecconst],ii ) and ( [ eq : gaussconst ] ) with operators which obey the non - canonical algebra of loop quantum gravity .",
    "the resulting constraint operators then serve to constrain a ray in the hilbert space with an appropriate inner - product @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "as dealing within the full quantum theory is technically difficult , we will deal with an effective quantum theory such as that which is often used in studies of loop quantum cosmology and the study of vacuum black hole interiors .",

    ", much progress has been made regarding the partial quantization of spherically symmetric inhomogeneous pure gravity in the interesting works on the exterior schwarzschild space - time @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the systems studied here are necessarily inhomogeneous , anisotropic , and non - vacuum , which leads to complications not present in simpler systems . to begin with",
    ", we will require an appropriate inhomogeneous and anisotropic matter contribution to the equations ( [ eq : vecconst],ii ) and ( [ eq : gaussconst ] ) .",
    "for this we choose an anisotropic fluid whose four - dimensional stress - energy tensor is given by : @xmath29 here @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the energy density , perpendicular ( to the inhomogeneous direction ) pressure and parallel pressure respectively as measured in the fluid element s rest frame .",

    "these vectors satisfy : @xmath35    the fluid is particularly useful in anisotropic studies as it provides one of the most general matter models allowed , yet still respecting the symmetry constraints . essentially , for anisotropic structures in",
    "spherical symmetry we require a stress - energy tensor of segre characteristic @xmath36 $ ] , and the spherically symmetric anisotropic fluid is one of the most general matter models which provide this . it may also be noted that the material ( [ eq : anisot ] ) is also capable of accommodated segre characteristic @xmath37 $ ] ( i.e. the perfect fluid ) in the special limit @xmath38 and can therefore be seen as a generalization on perfect fluids .",
    "a possibly more fundamental material , such as the scalar field , under certain assumptions on the field configuration which are compatible with spherical symmetry , is algebraically similar ( in its stress - energy tensor ) to the anisotropic or isotropic fluid @xcite , and therefore by choosing a fluid source we potentially cover these scenarios as well .",
    "finally , using the anisotropic fluid will simplify comparisons with purely classical solutions which most often use a fluid material as their source .",
    "hamiltonians for a dust and an isotropic perfect fluid have already been constructed in the literature @xcite-@xcite and , as is usual in fluid mechanics , variables more appropriate for thermodynamic studies are usually chosen . however , here we choose to work in the original fluid variables of ( [ eq : anisot ] ) as this system is more perspicuous and has immediate physical interpretation in these variables .",
    "the price to pay is that certain relationships between thermodynamic quantities ( such as temperature , entropy , etc . )",
    "are not enforced from the variational principle in this scheme , but these are usually not of primary interest in gravitational studies . for an in - depth treatment of more fundamental field couplings to loop quantum gravity see @xcite , @xcite .    as a fluid of this type",
    "is considered an effective matter model , there seems to be no lagrangian in the literature describing the anisotropic fluid .",
    "therefore we adopt here a pragmatic strategy often used in field theories @xcite .",
    "specifically , we will construct a lagrangian density , @xmath39 , which produces the desired equations of motion , in this case the stress - energy tensor ( [ eq : anisot ] ) .",
    "after the derivation , the conservation law ( which results from having a true scalar lagrangian and the gravitational field equations ) supplemented with the enforcement of the on - shell conditions ( [ eq : fluidvecs ] ) , which are also consequences of the variational principle in this scheme , will guarantee that the fluid equations of motion are obeyed .",
    "we propose the following matter action which produces the desired result : @xmath40 -2{p_{\\mbox{\\tiny{$\\perp$}}}}+ \\delta\\left[s_{\\alpha}s_{\\beta}\\,g^{\\alpha\\beta } -1 \\right]\\right\\}\\,d^{4}x\\ , , \\label{eq : fluidact}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we define @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which must be viewed as independent variables in their own right ( the quantity @xmath43 can be viewed as the particle number times the enthalpy ) . the quantities",

    "now , having established that @xmath30 and @xmath32 are scalars , the trace @xmath46 establishes that @xmath31 must also be a scalar quantity ( and hence so are @xmath43 and @xmath47 ) .",
    "note that with this particular choice of action the fluid variables @xmath43 and @xmath47 appear simply as lagrange multiplier fields which give rise to the set of constraints ( [ eq : fluidvecs ] ) , and their dynamics are not completely governed by their variation .",
    "instead , as mentioned above , the fluid dynamics are governed by variation of the gravitational degrees of freedom via the bianchi identities .",
    "this is in - line with the usual treatment of fluids in classical general relativity where one does not specify the fluid equations of motion separately .",

    "it is therefore possible in principle to have a model where the energy densities of both the classical and quantum corrected throat are zero at the throat , but in the vicinity of the throat region the energy density of the classical solution is negative and the quantum one is positive .    ideally one would like to analyze the individual pressures to completely specify the properties of the matter field .",

    "one loop - hole out of these arguments is the abandoning of the energy conditions , as it is known that energy condition violating matter can theoretically prevent such singularities from forming .",
    "it is also often believed that quantum gravity effects should take over close to singularity formation , when the curvature is large , and that these effects may prevent the formation of the classical singularity . in this vein",
    ", the loop quantum gravity paradigm has previously indicated that both in cosmology and black holes the quantum gravity effects have replaced the singularity with a smooth bounce @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite due to gravity becoming repulsive under certain situations in the quantum regime .",
    "that is , a scenario that classically requires matter energy condition violation to occur , can occur naturally within loop quantum gravity .",
    "what we find here in the context of wormholes is a manifestation of the same phenomenon . in order to support the wormhole classically",
    ", energy conditions must be violated to a certain degree . in the quantum corrected case , however , the energy condition violation is less , and this is directly due to the quantum properties of the gravitational field .",
    "it is , in principle from the above expressions , possible to find wormhole solutions where there is an energy density which is everywhere positive ( with a zero at the throat ) but whose classical counter - part yields an everywhere negative ( with a zero at the throat ) fluid energy density .",
    "this is due the repulsive nature of gravity in the regime where loop quantum effects become important .",
    "it should be noted that these are low - order quantum corrections , similar to those employed in most studies of effective loop quantum black holes or loop quantum cosmology .",
    "it is a possibility that higher order corrections may improve the energy condition situation even further .",
    "related to this , the repulsive nature of the gravitation under such extreme conditions could act to alleviate the singularities that are thought to occur when space - time topology changes classically .",
    "( although even classically it has been shown that there are some topology changing scenarios where the singularities are not curvature singularities but merely metric ones @xcite . )",
    "we have studied anisotropic spherically symmetric systems in the 3 + 1 hamiltonian formalism of gravity in the variables used in loop quantum gravity . by replacing the su(2 ) connection with functions that encode the holonomy structure of the corresponding operator we essentially have an effective theory with some quantum inspired corrections . in the case of wormhole throats it was found that the energy density of the material source is increased in comparison to the purely classical case .",
    "this may indicate that the energy condition violation ubiquitous in wormhole throats in einstein gravity may be lessened by quantum gravity effects .",
