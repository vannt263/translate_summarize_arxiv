    "decays of pseudoscalar mesons to light leptons are suppressed in the standard model ( sm ) by angular momentum conservation . in particular , the sm width of @xmath4 decays ( with @xmath5 ) is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the fermi constant , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are meson and lepton masses , @xmath10 is the decay constant , and @xmath11 is the corresponding ckm matrix element .    within the two higgs doublet models ( 2hdm of type ii ) , including the minimal supersymmetric one , the charged higgs boson ( @xmath12 ) exchange induces a tree - level contribution to ( semi)leptonic decays proportional to the yukawa couplings of quarks and leptons  @xcite . in @xmath13 , it can compete with the @xmath14 exchange due to the helicity suppression of the latter . at tree level ,",
    "the @xmath12 exchange contribution is lepton flavour independent , and for @xmath15 leads to  @xcite @xmath16 ^ 2.\\ ] ] here @xmath17 is the @xmath12 mass , @xmath18 is the ratio of the two higgs vacuum expectation values , and @xmath19 is an effective coupling .    a plausible choice of parameters @xmath20 , @xmath21 leads to @xmath22 relative suppression of @xmath23 decays , and @xmath24 suppression of @xmath25 decays with respect to their sm rates .",
    "however , searches for new physics in the decay rates are hindered by the uncertainties of their sm predictions .",
    "in particular , interpretation of the measurements of the ratio @xmath26 in terms of constraints on ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) phase space is currently limited by lattice qcd uncertainties  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the ratio of kaon leptonic decay widths @xmath27 , where the notation @xmath28 is adopted for @xmath29 decays , is sensitive to loop - induced lepton flavour violating ( lfv ) effects via the @xmath12 exchange  @xcite : @xmath30 where the mixing parameter between the superpartners of the right - handed leptons @xmath31 can reach @xmath32 .",
    "this can enhance @xmath0 by @xmath33 relative without contradicting any presently known experimental constraints , including upper bounds on the lfv decays @xmath34 with @xmath35 .    unlike the individual @xmath36",
    "decay widths , the ratio @xmath27 is precisely predicted within the sm due to cancellation of hadronic uncertainties  @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is an electromagnetic correction due to the internal bremsstrahlung ( ib ) process .",
    "the sensitivity to lfv and the precision of the sm prediction make @xmath0 an excellent probe of lepton universality .",
    "the current world average ( based on final results only ) @xmath39 is dominated by a recent kloe result  @xcite .",
    "a precise measurement of @xmath0 based on a part ( 40% ) of the data sample collected by the cern na62 experiment in 2007 is reported here .",
    "this is an update of an earlier result obtained with the same data sample  @xcite .",
    "the na48/2 experimental setup  @xcite has been used for the na62 200708 data taking .",
    "experimental conditions have been optimized for the @xmath40 measurement .",
    "the beam line is designed to deliver simultaneous unseparated @xmath41 and @xmath42 beams derived from the sps 400 gev/@xmath43 primary protons .",
    "however , the muon sweeping system was optimized for the positive beam in 2007 , and the sample used for the present analysis was collected with the @xmath41 beam only .",
    "positively charged particles within a narrow momentum band of @xmath44 gev/@xmath43 are selected by an achromatic system of four dipole magnets with zero total deflection , pass through a muon sweeping system , and enter a fiducial decay volume contained in a 114 m long cylindrical vacuum tank .    with about @xmath45",
    "primary protons incident on the target per sps pulse of about @xmath46  s duration , the secondary beam flux at the entrance to the decay volume is @xmath47 particles per pulse , of which 5% are kaons ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the fraction of beam kaons decaying in the vacuum tank at nominal momentum is @xmath48 .",
    "the transverse size of the beam within the decay volume is @xmath49  mm ( rms ) , and its angular divergence is negligible .    among the subdetectors located downstream the decay volume , a magnetic spectrometer , a plastic scintillator hodoscope ( hod ) and a liquid krypton electromagnetic calorimeter ( lkr ) are principal for the measurement .",
    "the spectrometer , used to detect charged products of kaon decays , is composed of four drift chambers ( dchs ) and a dipole magnet .",
    "the hod producing fast trigger signals consists of two planes of strip - shaped counters .",
    "the lkr , used for particle identification and as a veto , is an almost homogeneous ionization chamber , @xmath50 deep , segmented transversally into 13,248 cells ( @xmath51 each ) , and with no longitudinal segmentation .",
    "a beam pipe traversing the centres of the detectors allows undecayed beam particles and muons from decays of beam pions to continue their path in vacuum .",
    "a minimum bias trigger configuration has been employed .",
    "the @xmath52 trigger condition consists of coincidence of hits in the two hod planes ( the @xmath53 signal ) , loose lower and upper limits on dch hit multiplicity ( the 1-track signal ) , and lkr energy deposit @xmath54 of at least 10 gev .",
    "the @xmath55 trigger condition requires a coincidence of the @xmath56 and 1-track signals downscaled by a factor @xmath57 .",
    "the analysis strategy is based on counting the numbers of reconstructed @xmath52 and @xmath58 candidates collected concurrently .",
    "thus the analysis does not rely on the absolute beam flux measurement , and several systematic effects ( e.g. due to charged track reconstruction and @xmath56 trigger efficiencies , time - dependent effects ) cancel at first order .    due to the significant acceptance and background dependence ,",
    "the measurement is performed independently in 10 bins of lepton momentum covering a range from 13 to 65  gev/@xmath43 .",
    "the first bin spans 7 gev/@xmath43 , while the others are 5 gev/@xmath43 wide .",
    "the selection conditions have been optimized separately in each momentum bin .",
    "the ratio @xmath0 in each bin is computed as @xmath59 where @xmath60 are the numbers of selected @xmath36 candidates @xmath61 , @xmath62 are the numbers of background events , @xmath63 is the geometric acceptance correction , @xmath64 are the lepton identification efficiencies , @xmath65 are the trigger efficiencies , @xmath66 is the global efficiency of the lkr readout , and @xmath57 is the @xmath58 trigger downscaling factor .    to evaluate the acceptance correction and the geometric parts of the acceptances for background processes , a detailed monte carlo ( mc ) simulation including beam line optics , full detector geometry and material description , magnetic fields , local inefficiencies of dch wires , non - working lkr cells ( 0.8% of channels ) and temporarily masked lkr cells is used .",
    "particle identification , trigger and readout efficiencies are measured directly from data .",
    "charged particle tracks are reconstructed from hits and drift times in the spectrometer .",
    "track momenta are evaluated using a detailed magnetic field map .",
    "clusters of energy deposition in the lkr are found by looking at the maxima in the digitized pulses from individual cells in both space and time , and accumulating the energy within a radius of 11  cm .",
    "shower energies are corrected for energy outside the cluster boundary , energy lost in non - working cells , and cluster energy sharing .",
    "due to the topological similarity of @xmath52 and @xmath58 decays , a large part of the selection is common for the two modes : ( 1 ) exactly one reconstructed particle of positive electric charge geometrically consistent with originating from a kaon decay is required ; ( 2 ) extrapolated track impact points in the dchs , hod and lkr must be within their geometrical acceptances ; ( 3 ) track momentum must be in the range ( 13 ; 65 )  gev/@xmath43 , where the lower limit assures the efficiency of the @xmath67  gev trigger condition ; ( 4 ) no lkr energy deposition clusters with energy @xmath68  gev and in time with the track are allowed unless they are consistent with being produced by the track via direct energy deposition or bremsstrahlung ; ( 5 ) the reconstructed decay vertex longitudinal position must be within the nominal decay volume ; ( 6 ) distance between the charged track and the nominal kaon beam axis must be below 3.5  cm .",
    "the following two principal criteria are used to distinguish @xmath52 from @xmath58 decays .",
    "kinematic identification is based on constraining the reconstructed squared missing mass in positron ( muon ) hypothesis @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the four - momenta of the kaon ( defined as the average one monitored with @xmath72 decays ) and the lepton ( under the @xmath73 or @xmath74 mass hypothesis ) . the limits @xmath75 and @xmath76 have been optimized taking into account the resolution and backgrounds , and vary among lepton momentum bins in the ranges ( 0.013 ; 0.016 ) and ( 0.010 ; 0.014 ) ( gev/@xmath77)@xmath78 , respectively .",

    ".    however , the muon passage through the pb wall affects the measured @xmath94 via two principal effects : 1 ) ionization energy loss in pb decreases @xmath87 and dominates at low momentum ; 2 ) bremsstrahlung in pb increases @xmath87 and dominates at high momentum . to evaluate the corresponding correction factor @xmath95 , a dedicated geant4 based  @xcite mc simulation of muon propagation downstream the spectrometer involving all electromagnetic processes , including muon bremsstrahlung  @xcite , has been developed .",
    "the relative systematic uncertainties on @xmath87 and @xmath96 obtained by simulation are estimated to be @xmath97 , mainly due to the simulation of cluster geometry and calibration ( measured and simulated @xmath98 are shown in fig .  2 ) . however , the error affecting their ratio is significantly smaller ( @xmath99 ) due to partial cancellation of uncertainties .",
