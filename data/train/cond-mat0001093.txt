    "a stretched solid breaks instantaneously when the external widening stress exceeds a critical value corresponding to the limit of mechanical stability of the system . for smaller stresses",
    "the fracture is time - delayed and assisted by thermal fluctuations . at sufficiently low temperatures",
    "there can be quantum effects , and the breaking rate becomes temperature independent .",
    "this last situation is the main subject of this paper .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional system ( for example , a polymer chain or nanotube ) stretched by a constant external force applied at the chain ends at zero temperature , where quantum tunneling is the only mechanism responsible for the fracture .",
    "there have been several attempts in the past to study this problem@xcite@xcite however its many - body nature was not taken into account until the pioneering work of dyakonov@xcite , who gave qualitatively correct results in the limits of weak and large external forces . a more precise analytical approach to the problem",
    "valid for small external forces has been suggested recently by levitov",
    "_ et al_@xcite .",
    "we will adopt a general formalism that allows us to look at various limits from a single viewpoint . according to feynman@xcite the tunneling rate per unit length",
    "is given by @xmath0 where _ a _ is the imaginary - time action calculated along particle trajectories connecting the `` initial '' ( stretched ) and `` final '' ( broken ) states of the chain , @xmath1 is planck s constant , and the summation is performed over all trajectories . in the quasiclassical limit the trajectories contributing most to the sum satisfy the stationarity condition @xmath2 .",
    "these trajectories describe how the system traverses the classically- forbidden region , going from an unbroken chain into a configuration from which even a classical chain released at rest would break irreversibly .",
    "it is convenient to combine this motion with its time reversal to form a localized path called a `` bounce''@xcite . in the quasiclassical approximation",
    "the tunneling rate is given by w b ( - a_bounce/ ) [ eq1 ] where the amplitude _ b _ and action @xmath3 are calculated for the bounce ( there is no factor of 2 in the exponential from the squaring because the bounce covers both the past and future ) .",
    "we will demonstrate below that the problem of finding bounce solutions is identical to the classical problem of finding the equilibrium crack configuration for a two - dimensional solid stretched by a constant uniaxial stress ",
    "yet another example of the correspondence between one - dimensional quantum field theory and two - dimensional statistical mechanics@xcite . in view of this equivalence the results of @xcite and @xcite",
    "are already implied by the classical works of griffith@xcite .",
    "the present contribution to this field contains two main results .",
    "first , in the limit of a large applied force close to the limit of mechanical stability we find an exact bounce solution ; simultaneously this for the first time determines the equilibrium crack configuration in the large stress classical limit .",
    "establishing the range of applicability of this solution reveals that fluctuations inevitably come into play in the immediate vicinity of the limit of mechanical stability .",
    "second , we show how the bounce solutions can be used to provide insight into the real time post - tunneling dynamics .",
    "the imaginary - time action describing a one - dimensional chain stretched by an external force _ p _ applied to the chain ends has the form a = dx dt [ ( ^2 + c^2 u^2 ) - p u^ ] + dt [ v(h ) - p h ] [ eq2 ] where @xmath4 is the linear particle density , @xmath5 is the spatial coordinate ( along the chain length ) , @xmath6 is the imaginary time coordinate , @xmath7 is the particle displacement field , and dots and primes stand for the imaginary time ( t ) , and spatial ( x ) derivatives .",
    "the first integral is over all positions and times except for a small region near @xmath8 , where the break will appear .",
    "this separates the line into two pieces , so that for all @xmath6 the field _ u _ is discontinuous : @xmath9 ; however , we expect @xmath10 to be small outside a well - defined time interval .",
    "we have defined @xmath10 so that the distance between the two parts of the chain is @xmath11 , where _ a _ is the equilibrium @xmath12 interparticle spacing in the chain .",
    "the coupling between the segments of the chain in the tear region is given by the potential of cohesive forces _",
    "v_(_h _ ) which describes the interaction between the two ends of the broken chain for arbitrary separation  that is , it goes beyond the harmonic approximation .",
    "the properties of the function _",
    "v_(_h _ ) can be summarized as follows ( fig .",
    "1 ) . for @xmath13",
    "it obeys hooke s law : @xmath14 , so that the two parts of the chain are joined into one elastic medium . for large negative _ h",

    "_ it approaches a constant , @xmath16 , which is the work done in infinitely separating the halves of the chain ; @xmath17 can also be called the bond energy and the factor of 2 is introduced to indicate that there is an energy @xmath18 associated with each free end of the half- infinite chain pieces . in what follows we will also need to know the properties of the cohesive force function @xmath19 shown schematically on fig .",
    "2 : for small _ h _ it grows linearly with @xmath20 , reaching a maximal value @xmath21 at @xmath22 , while _ g_(_h _ ) decreases to zero as @xmath23 .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 can be called the critical bond lengthening , while @xmath25 is the limit of mechanical stability of the system  indeed only for @xmath26 does @xmath27the total potential energy in the external field ) have a metastable minimum at @xmath28fig.3 ) corresponding to the equilibrium stretched chain .",
    "the bounce solution is shown schematically on fig.4 using the imaginary time variable @xmath6 as a second ( space - like ) coordinate .",
    "the particle world lines belonging to the two ends of the breaking chain deviate significantly from each other for a time interval and then come back together .",
    "the external force _",
    "p _ applied at the chain ends is time - independent , therefore it is shown schematically by series of arrows of the same length pointing in the spatial ( x ) direction .    the action ( [ eq2 ] ) and the figures can be interpreted as representing a two - dimensional `` crystal '' of particle world lines subject to a uniaxial stress _ p _ , and in this interpretation the bounce of fig .",
    "4 is a critical crack , poised between the small perturbations that can spontaneously heal and the large disruptions that lead to fracture .",
    "we note in passing that our point of view that the crack opening is nonzero everywhere is different from that of many classical approaches@xcite , which restrict the break to a finite region completely surrounded by an elastic medium .",
    "our treatment contains the standard approach as a special case .    to see the connection to the classical fracture problem",
    "explicitly let us seek extremal paths for the action ( [ eq3 ] ) by varying @xmath29 while keeping the boundary values @xmath10 fixed .",
    "the condition @xmath30 reduces to the laplace equation d^2u / dt^2 + c^2 u^ = 0 [ eq3 ] the solution to ( [ eq3 ] ) satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath31 has the form u(x , t ) = pc^2 x + sign x2",
    "^+_- d2 h ( ) + x + x2c ^+_- dt^ h(t^)(t^- t)^2 + x^2/c^2 [ eq4 ] where the first term describes the stretched chain , the second is due to the break , and the fourier transform @xmath32 has been introduced .",
    "substituting ( [ eq4 ] ) in ( [ eq2 ] ) , integrating over x , and ignoring overall constants we find the action in a form that depends only on the field _ h _ a = -d2^_|t - t^|t_0(t )",
    "dt ( |t - t^|/t_0 ) h ( t^)dt^+ dt[v(h ) - ph ] [ eq5 ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is a cutoff introduced to prevent singularities for @xmath35 .",
    "if imaginary time is viewed as a space - like variable then the action ( [ eq5 ] ) can be interpreted as a hamiltonian describing a `` crack '' in a two - dimensional `` crystal '' of particle world lines .",
    "the crack can be represented by a distribution of fictitious dislocations@xcite , and then the first term of ( [ eq5 ] ) describes the logarithmic interaction of these dislocations with each other with an interaction strength _",
    "d _ , a `` dislocation density '' given by @xmath36 , and `` burgers vectors '' pointing along the chain .",
    "similarly the second integral in ( [ eq5 ] ) can be thought of as describing the cohesive interaction _ v_(_h _ ) between the sides of the `` crack '' in the presence of the external opening field _ p_. a free - energy functional similar to ( [ eq5 ] ) has been proposed in @xcite and @xcite as a field - theoretical starting point of classical fracture mechanics .",
    "the configuration @xmath10 for which ( [ eq5 ] ) is extremal is determined by the condition @xmath37 : d ^+_-h ( t^ ) dt^= g(h ) - p [ eq6 ] here and below the singular integral is taken as a principal value .",
    "a model of cracks based on a singular nonlinear integral equation of the form ( [ eq6 ] ) has been analyzed by blekherman and indenbom@xcite .",
    "the sound velocity c sets the upper limit on the value of @xmath38 , therefore the physical solutions to ( [ eq6 ] ) should satisfy @xmath39 ; at the same time the field @xmath10 can take on arbitrarily large values .",
    "a bounce solution to ( [ eq6 ] ) will have the following form ( figs .",

    ", we find the tunneling action that goes into the probability ( [ eq1 ] ) a_bounce = ^+_-dt[u(h ) - u(h_1 ) - h - h_12 du(h)dh ] [ eq7 ] where we used the result due to blekherman and indenbom@xcite that @xmath46 = 0 $ ] ( total zero force along the tear ) for the solution to ( [ eq6 ] ) satisfying @xmath47 .    for large @xmath48 we can use a harmonic approximation , since the function @xmath10 is close to its asymptotic limit @xmath49 .",
    "thus we introduce @xmath50 and approximate the right - hand side of ( [ eq6 ] ) by @xmath51 , valid for @xmath52 . expanding the integrand of ( [ eq6 ] ) in @xmath53 and noting that @xmath10 is even in @xmath6 we find ( t ) = dt^2u^(h_1 ) ^+_-(t^)dt^ [ eq8 ] however , this is not very interesting , since within the harmonic approximation the tunneling action ( [ eq7 ] ) vanishes .",
    "further progress can be made by looking separately at the cases of weak and strong tearing force where the tunneling action can be computed in a controlled fashion .",
    "in studying the weak force limit , @xmath56 , we can import some ideas from classical fracture mechanics*. * the position of the unstable maximum @xmath57 of the function _ u_(_h _ ) ( fig.3 ) shifts to infinity as @xmath58",
    ". however the amplitude of the bounce solution must be larger than @xmath59 , thus implying that over some time the distance between the edges of the tear is much bigger than equilibrium interparticle spacing . since the bounce tail ( [ eq8 ] ) does not contribute to the tunneling action ( [ eq7 ] ) in quadratic order",
    ", we can take _ h _ to be nonzero only within a time interval @xmath60fig.4 ) . the tunneling time",
    "2l will be determined later .",
    "the cohesive force , _ g_(_h _ ) , is negligible for @xmath61 and operative beyond this interval .",
    "the latter feature implies that there is a strain outside the segment @xmath62 $ ] that takes care of the assumed @xmath63 .",
    "then ( [ eq6 ] ) simplifies to d ^+l_-l h ( t^ ) dt^= - p [ eq9 ] for @xmath64 l. neglect of the cohesive forces within the tunneling interval implies that the edges of the tear are force free , i.e. @xmath65 ; this condition applied to the representation ( [ eq4 ] ) with the limits of the integration set by @xmath66 and @xmath67 indeed reproduces ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "in the same approximation the total potential @xmath68 can be replaced by @xmath69 , and ( [ eq7 ] ) simplifies to a_bounce = ^+l_-ldt(2- 12 ph ) [ eq10 ] where for @xmath56 we neglected @xmath70 compared to @xmath17 .",
