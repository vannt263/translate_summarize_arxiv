    "the _ covering spectrum _ of a geodesic space , introduced by christina sormani and guofang wei ( @xcite , @xcite ) , provides a way to understand the topology of the space at a given scale . their construction uses a classical method of spanier ( @xcite ) that produces a covering map for a given open cover ; in particular , they use the covering map @xmath5 of a geodesic space @xmath1 corresponding to the open cover by @xmath3-balls .",
    "such a cover is constructed for every @xmath6 , yielding a parameterized collection @xmath7 .",
    "the covering spectrum consists of those @xmath6 such that for all @xmath8 , the covering maps @xmath9 and @xmath10 are not equivalent ( see also remark [ swr ] below ) .",
    "sormani and wei used these covering maps , and the covering spectrum , to obtain interesting results concerning limits of compact riemannian manifolds with ricci curvature uniformly bounded below .",
    "valera berestovskii and conrad plaut independently developed a method to construct covering maps determined by geometric information - first for topological groups ( @xcite ) and later for uniform spaces ( @xcite , @xcite ) , hence metric spaces .",
    "unlike spanier s construction , which uses classical ( continuous ) paths and homotopies , the berestovskii - plaut construction uses discrete chains and homotopies , which we will discuss in more detail in the following section .",
    "one consequence is that the construction works for an arbitrary connected metric space and yields , for each @xmath11 , a covering map @xmath12 and corresponding deck group @xmath13 , called the @xmath4-cover and @xmath14-group , respectively .",
    "plaut and wilkins show in @xcite that for compact geodesic spaces the sormani - wei cover @xmath10 is equivalent to @xmath15 when @xmath16 . at the same time , in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , they give several topological and geometric applications of the discrete methods .",
    "for example , in @xcite the authors strengthen a theorem of m. gromov ( @xcite ) that the fundamental group of any compact riemannian manifold of diameter at most @xmath17 has a set of generators @xmath18 of length at most @xmath19 and relators of the form @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , they obtain an explicit bound for the number @xmath21 of generators in terms of the number of equivalence classes of short loops  at every point and the number of balls required to cover a given semi - locally simply connected geodesic space . as a corollary",
    "they obtain a curvature free  fundamental group finiteness theorem ( new even for riemannian manifolds ) that generalizes the finiteness theorems of anderson ( @xcite ) and shen - wei ( @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    ", they investigate the covers of gromov - hausdorff convergent sequences , where discrete methods are particularly useful due to the well - established principle that many properties of the limit of a convergent sequence of compact metric spaces @xmath22 can be formulated in terms of the limits of finite point sets ( cf .",
    "chapter 7 of @xcite ) .",
    "they establish a type of weak closure result for a collection of covers called _ circle covers _ that generalize @xmath4-covers , allowing them to complete the investigation of sormani - wei into the structure of limits of @xmath3-covers . in @xcite , wilkins employs these discrete methods to relate the existence of universal covers of peano continua to the geometry and topology of various generalized fundamental groups .",
    "for example , he shows that such a space has a universal cover if and only if the revised and uniform fundamental groups are finitely presented , which , in turn , holds if and only both groups are discrete in a specific topology called the _ covering topology_.    in @xcite , plaut and wilkins ask to what degree these concepts are topological invariants .",
    "the present paper represents a start on that program by moving beyond the geodesic case .",
    "there are many reasons why one would want to pursue such a program , including the existence of new topological invariants . as an example , given a peano continuum @xmath1 , one can consider the collection of all covering maps of @xmath1 ( with connected domain ) that are @xmath4-covers for some geodesic metric ( or more general metric ) on @xmath1 . for instance , up to rescaling , there is only one geodesic metric on a topological circle , and the only @xmath4-covers for that metric are the trivial cover and the universal cover ; the @xmath23-fold covers of the circle are not @xmath14-covers for the geodesic metric .",
    "we conjecture that the same is true for any metric on the circle ( assuming the covers have connected domain ) . on the other hand , @xmath24 with an open disc removed",
    "is homeomorphic to the moebius band , and so there are geodesic metrics on the moebius band that gromov - hausdorff approximate @xmath24 .",
    "it follows from the convergence results of @xcite that the 2-fold cover of the moebius band occurs as an @xmath4-cover for some geodesic metrics . in other words",
    ", one can distinguish between the circle and the moebius band on this basis , despite the fact that the circle is a deformation retraction of the moebius band .",
    "however , other than directly classifying all of the @xmath14-covers in examples like the circle , at this point we have few good methods to show that a given cover is _ not _ an @xmath4-cover for some geodesic metric , and it may be easier to consider more broadly the collection of covering maps that are @xmath4-covers for some compatible metric in general . in this case one",
    "has to consider the possibility that @xmath25 is not connected , and also that the analog of the covering spectrum may not be discrete in @xmath26 .",
    "the latter possibility is one of the main complications of the non - geodesic case , and understanding it is a main thrust of this paper .    note also that these discrete methods - unlike geodesic methods - can be applied to fractals with no rectifiable curves like the sierpinski gasket with its resistance metric ,  which is not geodesic and different from the metric induced by the plane ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "one may also consider more exotic spaces such as metrized solenoids , and - as was already observed in @xcite - the topologist s sine curve .",
    "finally , one should recall that gromov - hausdorff convergence of non - compact proper geodesic spaces is generally reduced to consideration of metric balls which , even in geodesic spaces , need not themselves be geodesic spaces when equipped with the subspace metric .",
    "the results of this paper are built around a natural defintion of the _ critical spectrum _ for an arbitrary metric space .",
    "the precise definition ( definition [ crit value def ] ) requires some technical background given in section 2 , but the critical spectrum of a metric space @xmath1 - denoted by @xmath0 - can be intuitively thought of as the set of all positive real numbers @xmath4 at which the equivalence type of @xmath4-covers changes as @xmath4 decreases toward @xmath27 .",
    "this spectrum extends both the covering spectrum of sormani - wei and the homotopy critical spectrum of plaut - wilkins ( @xcite ) to the non - geodesic case .",
    "the latter spectra are known to be discrete in @xmath26 for any compact geodesic metric ( see section 3 ) , but for non - geodesic spaces the situation is more complicated .",
    "first of all , we have    there exist compact , connected metric spaces with critical spectra that are not discrete in @xmath26 .",
    "in section 3 we give a formal classification of the ways in which discreteness may fail . in section 4 , we give examples of many of the types of critical values deduced in section 3 using spaces we call rapunzel s combs . to begin with ,",
    "one may identify two types of fundamental critical values - homotopy and refinement critical values .",
    "the resulting spectra are denoted by @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "homotopy critical values are defined for metric spaces in the same way that they are defined for geodesic spaces , and are more topologically significant than refinement critical values , although the latter do indicate a lack of connectivity of certain metric balls ( proposition [ local conn thm ] ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath29 is empty for geodesic spaces , and refinement critical values can often be removed by changing the metric :    [ eintrinsic metric ] let @xmath30 be a compact , connected metric space .",
    "then for every @xmath11 there is a metric @xmath31 on @xmath1 such that    1 .",
    "@xmath32 , and @xmath33 if and only if @xmath34 .",
    "2 .   @xmath35 and @xmath36 are bi - lipschitz equivalent .",
    "@xmath36 has no refinement critical values greater than @xmath4 .",
    "the metric @xmath31 is called the _",
    "@xmath4-intrinsic metric induced by @xmath35_. note that the only obstruction in theorem [ eintrinsic metric ] to possibly removing _ all _ refinement critical values is that one may have @xmath37 ( see theorem [ ulcc ] ) .",
    "rapunzel s combs show that not all critical values are refinement or homotopy critical values , but these two types determine the entire spectrum :    [ spec equals closure hrcv ] let @xmath1 be a compact , connected metric space . if @xmath38 denotes the closure of the homotopy critical spectrum @xmath28 in @xmath39 , then @xmath40    since a geodesic space @xmath1 has no refinement critical values , the discreteness of @xmath28 in @xmath41 when @xmath1 is compact immediately yields the following .",
    "[ geodesic crs ] if @xmath1 is geodesic , then @xmath42 .",
    "if @xmath1 is also compact , then @xmath43 .",
    "we are also able to classify isolated critical values :    [ characterize isolated cv ] if @xmath1 is a compact metric space , and if @xmath11 is an isolated critical value of @xmath1 , then @xmath4 is a homotopy or a refinement critical value .    finally , it is interesting to consider the limit of the metrics @xmath31 described in theorem [ eintrinsic metric ] , which are monotone increasing as @xmath44 . in general the limit",
    "need not be finite , or if it is finite , topologically equivalent to the original metric .",
    "however , we do have :    [ ulcc ] let @xmath30 be a compact , connected metric space .",
    "if @xmath45 is finite , then @xmath46 has no refinement critical values .",
    "if , in addition , @xmath30 and @xmath46 are topologically equivalent then @xmath45 is a geodesic metric  and hence @xmath1 is locally path connected .    some of the research contained in this paper was carried out by the undergraduate authors during an reu at the university of tennessee in summer 2009 and during the subsequent year .",
    "the quality of contributions by undergraduate co - authors in published papers is known to vary from paper to paper . in the case of the present work ,",
    "the contributions of the undergraduate authors are substantial , including the discovery of rapunzel s combs and insights into the distinct types of critical values in general metric spaces .",
    "omitted proofs of statements in this section may be found in @xcite or @xcite . given a metric space @xmath30",
    ", we will denote the open metric balls of radius @xmath14 centered at @xmath47 by @xmath48 .",
    "if multiple metrics on the same space are being considered , we will distinguish them by subscripts : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , etc .",
