    "the low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) 4u1636 - 536 is a well - known type - i x - ray burster , which has been extensively observed over the past four decades and is considered well - established as a persistent x - ray source ( see references in * ? ? ?",
    "its optical counterpart ( v801 ara ) revealed its 3.8h orbital period @xcite through photometric variations , but the period has also been detected spectroscopically @xcite .",
    "however , during 2001 , the _ all sky monitor _ onboard the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( rxte / asm ) recorded an obvious , gradual decline of its x - ray flux level . within a year",
    ", it began to exhibit a substantial quasi - periodic , long - term variability of @xmath146d @xcite .",
    "more remarkably , shih et al . also reported that this variation was present at both soft ( 2 - 12 kev , rxte / asm ) and hard ( 20 - 100 kev , integral / ibis ) x - ray energies , but that these were _ anti - correlated_. such a pronounced energy - dependent phenomenon led to the suggestion of an accretion disc instability as the most likely explanation , as the result of a decrease in the mass transfer rate .",
    "+ @xcite provided further evidence regarding the nature of the long - term variability of 4u1636 - 536 based on a @xmath11.5 yr rxte / pca monitoring campaign from march 2005 to september 2006 .",
    "the lightcurves display long - term variability of 30 - 40d which is consistent with the temporal and energy changes that occur between two states of atoll sources : the _ island _ ( hard ) and _ banana _ ( soft ) states @xcite . from recently published swift / bat hard x - ray ( 20 - 50 kev ) light curves that began in 2005 , @xcite have confirmed the anti - correlated relationship between the soft and hard x - rays in 4u 1636 - 536 , providing further support for the suggestion of a state change / accretion instability within the source . + according to the standard model for lmxbs , their optical emission is dominated by x - ray reprocessing in the accretion disc around the compact object @xcite .",
    "thus , the varying x - ray flux of 4u1636 - 536 should also influence the apparent brightness of its optical counterpart . with this in mind , we began a @xmath1100d optical daily monitoring program which was expected to cover at least 2 cycles of the previously observed long term x - ray variability in 4u1636 - 536 .",
    "+ in this paper , we report the results of our optical observations , and compare them with the simultaneous x - ray data available from the rxte / asm and swift / bat archives .",
    "these x - ray monitoring data also allowed us to investigate the long - term variability properties of 4u 1636 - 536 as a function of x - ray energy .",
    "an x - ray spectroscopic analysis of rxte / pca and hexte data was carried out to investigate the evolution of its spectral properties as a function of the long - term variability .",
    "we also discuss possible physical mechanisms that might drive such phenomena .",
    "we performed a 3 months optical monitoring of 4u1636 - 536 using the noao smarts 1.3 m telescope with the andicam on cerro tololo , chile between 01 april and 30 june 2008 .",
    "the ccd for the andicam is a fairchild 447 2048x2048 ccd with 15-micron pixels .",
    "each night , a pair of exposures of 2 minutes each through both b and v filters was taken . in total",
    ", we obtained 67 nights of good data during the campaign .",
    "data reductions , such as bias subtraction and flat - field correction , were provided by the yale smarts team .",
    "+ we utilised the aperture photometry package iraf / daophot to extract photometric information from the data .",
    "a number of bright comparison stars ( listed in the nomad catalog ) on the same ccd frame were selected to reconstruct the variability of the source , but absolute calibration of the field was not performed in this work . from the scatter of the differential magnitudes of companion stars ,",
    "the accuracy of the differential magnitude measurement of 4u 1636 - 536 is typically @xmath10.006 mag .",
    "+      since the 1960s 4u1636 - 536 has been frequently observed by many x - ray missions . the all - sky monitor",
    "( asm , 2 - 12 kev ) onboard the long - lived rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) has been providing the longest continuous coverage of all luminous x - ray sources , stretching from 1996 to the present day ( see * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , the hard x - ray transient monitor program , using the burst alert telescope ( bat , @xmath115 - 50 kev ) onboard swift , has been operating since 2005 @xcite .",
    "we retrieved both datasets up to 09 february 2009 from the heasarc archive and the website of the swift / bat hard x - ray transient monitor , respectively .",
    "figure [ multiple lightcurves ] displays the three months of smarts monitoring in the optical b and v bands , together with the simultaneous soft ( rxte / asm ) and hard x - ray ( swift / bat ) data .",
    "the first feature to note is the presence of a nearly regular variation in all wavelengths , which is even more obvious in the x - ray data . in figure [ ls periodogram ]",
    "the lomb - scargle periodogram reveals a significant , consistent period of @xmath130 d at all wavelengths except the optical v band .",
    "we notice that the peak profile is rather wide , so we simulated our data with a 30d sine wave ( plus poisson noise ) using a similar count rate as observed for 4u 1636 - 536 .",
    "this simulation shows a peak with similar width to that observed , suggesting that it is a result of the short length of the simultaneous dataset ( only covering a few cycles ) .",
    "indeed , the peak width becomes narrower as we increase the duration of data included ( rxte / asm and swift / bat only ) .",
    "for example , within one year surrounding the campaign , the source clearly exhibited a significant long - term variability of @xmath1 30d in both energy bands .",

    "however , with the availability of both rxte / asm and swift / bat monitoring over extended periods of time , a time - dependent power spectral analysis , similar to that reported by @xcite on the superorbital modulation in smc x-1 , was performed in order to investigate the long - term variability evolution in 4u 1636 - 536 . as the timescale of interest is @xmath150d , a sliding data window of 200d",
    "was used . in order to provide some smoothing of the resulting dynamical power spectrum , each subsequent window moved forward by 50d .",
    "the resulting power spectrograms from both datasets are shown in figure [ swift and rxte power spectra ] .",
    "+    46d modulation reported by @xcite is marked by the dashed vertical line.,width=302 ]    our analysis suggests that even the dominant periodicity ( the darkest region ) is transient in nature .",
    "the most recent ( 2009 ) data show that the variation has evolved to a shorter timescale ( @xmath130d ) , but our analysis did not reveal any ultra long - term periodic trend , as was seen in e.g. smc x-1 @xcite .",
    "near the three months of smarts observations ( hjd @xmath154600 ) , it appears that the @xmath130 d period was only significant in swift / bat data .",
    "however , as we have shown in figure [ ls periodogram ] , the @xmath130 day period is also significant in rxte / asm data .",
    "+      to investigate the correlation between different wavebands , we performed a cross - correlation analysis with the three datasets : ( i ) optical and soft x - rays , ( ii ) optical to hard x - rays , ( iii ) soft and hard x - rays . since the variability is more significant in optical b band , that was used in the analysis ( after conversion from magnitude to intensity ) .",
    "+ our analysis adopted the interpolation method of calculating the cross - correlation function ( ccf , * ? ? ?",
    "the light curves were shifted backwards and forwards up to 30 days against each other in steps of 1 day .",
    "the results of this analysis are shown in figure [ cross correlation ] .",
    "+        the ccf analysis reveals a clear anti - correlation between the soft and hard x - rays . on the other hand ,",
    "the optical emission is positively correlated with the soft x - rays .",
    "however , we also note that the optical emission seems to lag the soft x - rays by @xmath1 1 - 2 days , which is much too long to be the result of x - ray reprocessing / irradiation ( time - scale of @xmath1 minutes ) .",
    "the optical emission , like the soft x - rays , is anti - correlated with hard x - rays , and the lag is slightly longer .",
    "however , we caution that the lag appearing in the ccf may not be real , but is instead an artefact related to the gaps in the optical data . a more regular and longer term optical campaign will be needed to confirm this .",
    "+      in an attempt to understand how the x - ray spectral properties of 4u 1636 - 536 evolve through the different phases of the long - term variability , a broad - band spectroscopic analysis was performed .",
    "we used archival rxte / pca and hexte data because of their wide spectral range between 2 and 250 kev @xcite .",
    "two observations , which represent two distinct epochs in the rxte / asm light - curve ( at maximum and minimum ) and sufficiently long to provide good signal - to - noise ratio , were selected ( see figure [ rxte_total ] ) :    * obsid 70036 - 01 - 02 - 00 ( mjd 54270 ) , at the peak of an oscillation * obsid 70034 - 01 - 01 - 000 ( mjd 53612 ) , at the minimum of an oscillation        the spectra were derived from pca standard-2 and hexte archive mode following standard procedures : using only pcu 2 ( the only pcu that operates in all our datasets ) in pca and cluster b ( which provides the necessary background information ) in hexte and the latest calibration data @xcite .",
    "the combined pca and hexte data were then analysed with xspec v.12.x . throughout the analysis , the galactic column density ( @xmath2 ) toward the source",
    "was fixed at 3@xmath310@xmath4 @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we note that this value is well within the range determined by the rosat position sensitive proportional counter observations ( pspc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to estimate the luminosity and radii ( see context below ) ,",
    "the distance of 4u 1636 - 535 is referred to @xmath1 5.9 kpc @xcite .",
    "+    .spectral model fits to two distinct states of 4u1636 - 536 with the rxte pca / hexte data .",
    "the x - ray luminosity is determined from the unabsorbed flux . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     figure [ spectral fitting result ] shows the data and model fits , with table [ spectral data ] summarising the best fit model details .",
    "the spectral properties of 70036 - 01 - 02 - 00 ( rxte / asm high epoch ) can be simply described by a model consisting of a multi - temperature accretion disc ( diskbb ) component plus a thermal comptonisation ( comptt , a spherical geometry was assumed ) component .",
    "+ on the other hand , the spectral properties of 70034 - 01 - 01 - 000 ( rxte / asm low epoch ) is more complicated .",
    "the same two - component model fit to the data is poor ( @xmath6 2 ) .",
    "instead , it is more compatible with a single - temperature blackbody component ( bbody ) plus a thermal comptonised one ( using the same input soft photon temperature t@xmath7 as in the high - state epoch ) .",
    "the blackbody component likely represents the emission from the surface of the neutron star . additionally , a power - law component for the hard x - rays @xmath8 50 kev and a lorentz profile at @xmath1 6.3 kev ( which may represent a relativistically broadened fe k@xmath9 emission line ) are required to improve the fitting result .",
    "we note that these additional components are quite similar to those observed in the hard state of black hole x - ray binaries , such as gro j1655 - 40 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "from the 3 years of simultaneous rxte / asm and swift / bat archival data on 4u1636 - 536 , it is clear that the variability , on both short and long time - scales , is indeed strongly energy - dependent .",
    "this was first noted in simultaneous rxte / asm and integral / ibis data @xcite , and has been a persistent feature of this source since 2002 , when rxte / asm observed the beginning of a dramatic decline in flux .",
    "additionally , we find that the long - term variability of 4u1636 - 536 has been constantly evolving over the last decade , although not in a periodic manner . + a tilted / warped , precessing accretion disc was suggested as an explanation for such long term variations @xcite , and the system parameters ( in particular the low mass - ratio ) of 4u 1636 - 536 do allow for a precessing accretion disc @xcite",
    ". however , the presence of an evolving trend in the long - term period , the anti - correlation between soft and hard x - rays , and the distinct x - ray spectral properties at different epochs are all difficult to understand in terms of a precessing disc .",
    "+ the x - ray spectroscopic analysis clearly reveals two different spectral states in the high and low epochs .",
    "it suggests that , in the high epoch , 4u1636 - 536 is like a typical lmxb : the accretion disc is fully developed and extends into the inner boundary region ( r@xmath10 25 km , assuming face - on orientation , @xmath11=0@xmath12 ) , which is likely surrounded by a comptonised region , or corona @xcite .",
    "the energy state is softer as the spectrum is dominated by soft x - rays ( 2 - 10 kev ) .",
    "+ in the low epoch , on the other hand , no reliable multi - temperature disc component could be derived suggesting that the accretion disc probably retreated away from the inner region , or was _ truncated_. instead , we have determined a soft x - ray emitting region of radius @xmath1 5 km , which most likely corresponds to the neutron stellar surface .",
    "we also note that the spectral data in the low epoch contains a high energy component ( @xmath850 kev ) which is very similar to that in a `` peculiar '' integral observation of 4u1636 - 536 @xcite , as well as to those of black hole binaries in hard x - ray states .",
    "clearly , 4u 1636 - 536 became significantly harder during the low epoch , as the hard x - ray luminosity ( l@xmath13  erg  s@xmath14 ) composed roughly half of the bolometric x - ray flux ( 2.0 - 80 kev , see table [ spectral data ] ) .",
    "+      the observed x - ray variability phenomena from 4u1636 - 536 resemble the main x - ray spectral states of black hole x - ray binaries , namely the `` hard '' and `` thermal '' states @xcite .",
    "currently , various flavours of accretion flow models have been developed , mainly for black hole x - ray binaries , to not only explain these main spectral states , but also the more subtle states observed ( e.g. see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "the most commonly used explanation assumes that the optically thick inner disc is replaced by a hot , optically thin , flow when black hole x - ray binaries change to the `` hard '' state .",
    "although a similar scenario is used to explain the state transition in atoll sources , there is a fundamental difference with their black hole cousins : the presence of an observable solid surface at the neutron star . with its frequent state changes and abundant archival data from rxte , swift and integral",
    ", 4u1636 - 536 could be an ideal target to study the behaviour of the accretion flow in neutron star binaries , and thereby adapt the models that are currently used for the bhxrbs .",
    "+      our three - month optical monitoring campaign on 4u1636 - 536 reveals a clear modulation which was obviously correlated with the x - ray states .",
    "not surprisingly , this is consistent with the currently accepted mechanism for lmxb optical counterparts that they are dominated by x - ray reprocessing on the accretion disc and heated face of the donor star by the central x - ray source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus the observed optical component largely follows variations in the intrinsic x - ray flux .",
    "+ our campaign also reveals that the increasing hard x - rays ( @xmath8 10 kev ) does not seem to influence the optical modulation .",
    "this is in contrast to lmc x-2 where its optical / x - ray correlation was much stronger with the hard x - rays than the soft @xcite , suggesting that different accretion mechanisms are working in the inner regions of these systems .",
    "+ one possible scenario that could explain our observation of 4u 1636 - 536 is compton reflection ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case ,",
    "the softer part of x - ray continuum ( power - law component with @xmath15  2.12 ) are photoelectrically absorbed by material in the disc / stellar surface , while a large fraction of the hard x - rays are scattered out of the system with little change in photon energy .",
    "since this would not explain the observations of lmc x-2 , we think that further research into this topic is warranted , especially given the improvement in hard x - ray spectroscopic sensitivity over the last decade .",
    "we have demonstrated that 4u1636 - 536 exhibits a coherent long - term variation across a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "the soft and hard x - rays are clearly anti - correlated on the @xmath130 - 50d variability timescale , and this appears to be a persistent phenomenon .",
    "the evolution of the broad - band spectral characteristics of 4u 1636 - 536 resembles the _ hard _ and _ soft / thermal _ state change usually seen in black hole x - ray binaries . +",
    "our work suggests that 4u 1636 - 536 is a unique and valuable target to understand the physics of x - rays binaries , including the size and location of the hard component in neutron star lmxbs , the interaction of hard x - rays with their surrounding environments such as the accretion disc / companion star surface , and the similarity or dissimilarity of accretion disc evolution between neutron star and black hole x - ray binaries .",
    "we are planning to explore these topics through a comprehensive optical spectroscopic and broad - band x - ray spectral analysis covering different variation epochs in the future .",
