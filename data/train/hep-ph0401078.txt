    "it is known that third generation squark loops can introduce sizeable cp violation in the higgs potential of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , if the soft - supersymmetry - breaking mass parameters of the third generation are complex ; see , for example ,  @xcite . as a result",
    ", the neutral higgs bosons will mix to produce three physical mass eigenstates with mixed cp parity , which we denote @xmath12 and @xmath5 in order of increasing mass .",
    "a benchmark scenario of maximal cp violation , called cpx , was introduced in ref .",

    "the phenomenological consequences of this model may be quite spectacular .",
    "in particular , the @xmath15 coupling of the lightest higgs boson can be significantly suppressed ; see , for example ,  @xcite and references therein . in this case",
    ", it was shown that the lep2 data do not exclude the existence of a light higgs boson with mass @xmath16  gev ( 40  gev ) in the minimal susy model with @xmath174 ( 23 ) and cp - violating phase _",

    "[ eq : a1 ] since the @xmath2 couplings to the @xmath18 and @xmath19 gauge bosons become rather small , it would be hard to detect the light higgs via the processes @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "it is therefore interesting to consider the possibility of observing a light higgs boson at the lhc or tevatron collider .",
    "however , in general , it will be hard to observe a light higgs at hadron colliders via the @xmath22 decay mode because , in particular , the transverse momenta of the outgoing @xmath3 and @xmath23 jets are not large . as a consequence",
    "the signal is swamped by the qcd @xmath22 background .",
    "therefore it was proposed  @xcite to search for a cp - violating light higgs boson in the _ exclusive _ process @xmath24 at hadron colliders , where the @xmath25  signs denote the presence of large rapidity gaps . over the past few years",
    "such exclusive diffractive processes have been considered as a promising way to search for manifestations of new physics in high energy proton - proton collisions ; see , for instance ,  @xcite .",
    "these processes have both unique experimental and theoretical advantages in hunting for higgs bosons as compared to the traditional non - diffractive approaches . in particular , in the exclusive diffractive reactions the @xmath22 background is suppressed  @xcite , and it may be feasible to isolate the signal .    in the present paper we discuss the central _ exclusive _ diffractive production ( cedp ) in more detail .",
    "we compare the signal and the background for observing a light neutral higgs boson via @xmath26 and @xmath27 decay modes",
    ". then we evaluate the asymmetry arising from the interference of the p - even and p - odd production amplitudes .",
    "note that this asymmetry is the most direct manifestation of cp - violation in the higgs sector .",
    "finally we consider the exclusive diffractive production of the heavier neutral higgs bosons , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , followed by the decays @xmath4 or @xmath28-jets . + for numerical estimates , we use the formalism to describe central production in diffractive exclusive processes of  @xcite , and the parameters ( that is the masses , width and couplings of the higgs bosons ) given by the code `` cpsuperh '' @xcite , where we choose @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31  tev , ( that is @xmath32  tev , @xmath33  tev , @xmath34  tev ) and the charged higgs boson mass @xmath35 gev so that the mass of the lightest higgs boson , @xmath2 , is @xmath36 gev .",
    "the exclusive process is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the cross section may be written@xcite as the product of the effective gluon ",
    "gluon luminosity @xmath37 , and the square of the matrix element of the subprocess @xmath38 .",
    "note that the hard subprocess is mediated by the quark / squark triangles . for a cp - violating higgs , there are two different vertices of the higgs ",
    "quark interaction : the scalar yukawa vertex and the vertex containing the @xmath39 dirac matrix .",
    "therefore the @xmath40 matrix element contains two terms : and @xmath41 in the mssm with cp - violation see , for example , @xcite . ] = g_s(e_1^e_2^ ) - g_p ^ e_1e_2p_1p_2/(p_1p_2 ) [ eq:1 ] where @xmath42 are the gluon polarisation vectors and @xmath43 is the antisymmetric tensor . in ( [ eq:1 ] )",
    "we have used a simplified form of the matrix element which already accounts for gauge invariance , assuming that the gluon virtualities are small in comparison with the higgs mass . in forward exclusive central production ,",
    "the incoming gluon polarisations are correlated , in such a way that the effective luminosity satisfies the p - even , @xmath44 selection rule  @xcite .",
    "therefore only the first term contributes to the strictly forward cross section .",
    "however , at non - zero transverse momenta of the recoil protons , @xmath45 , there is an admixture of the p - odd @xmath44 amplitude of order @xmath46 , on account of the @xmath41 term becoming active .",
    "thus we consider non - zero recoil proton transverse momenta , and demonstrate that the interference between the cp - even ( @xmath47 ) and cp - odd ( @xmath41 ) terms leads to left - right asymmetry in the azimuthal distribution of the outgoing protons .",
    "first , we consider the background .",
    "unfortunately , even in the exclusive process , we show below that the qcd @xmath22 background is too large .",
    "however , we shall see that it may be possible to observe such a cp - violating light higgs boson in the @xmath48 decay mode , where the qed background can be suppressed by selecting events with relatively large outgoing proton transverse momenta , say , @xmath49  mev .",
    "first , we consider the exclusive double - diffractive process ppp+(h)+p [ eq : a2 ] the signal - to - background ratio is given by the ratio of the cross sections for the hard subprocesses , since the effective gluon ",
    "gluon luminosity @xmath37 cancels out . the cross section for the @xmath38 subprocess to indicate that each of the incoming gluons belongs to colour - singlet pomeron exchange . here",
    "this notation is assumed to be implicit . ]",
    "@xcite ( ggh )  =  ( 1- )  ~(1- ) , [ eq:2]as the width , @xmath50 , behaves as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the fermi constant . on the other hand , at leading order , the qcd background is given by the @xmath53 subprocess ~ , [ eq:3 ] where @xmath54 is the transverse energy of the @xmath3 and @xmath23 jets . at leading order ( lo )",
    ", the cross section is suppressed by the @xmath44 selection rule ( which gives rise to the @xmath55 factor ) in comparison with the inclusive process .",
    "the extra factor was crucial to suppress the background .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that it is possible to achieve a signal - to - background ratio of about 3 for the detection of a standard model higgs with mass @xmath56  gev , by selecting @xmath22 exclusive events where the polar angle @xmath57 between the outgoing jets lies in the interval @xmath58 if the missing mass resolution @xmath59  gev .",
    "the situation is much worse for a light higgs , since the signal - to - background ratio behaves as   ~  m_^5 [ eq:4 ] where we have used @xmath60 .",
    "the @xmath61 behaviour comes just from dimensional counting . as the experimental resolution",
    "@xmath62 is larger than the width of the higgs , @xmath63 , the higgs cross section ( in the numerator ) is driven by @xmath64 , while the qcd background is proportional to @xmath65 and the size of the @xmath62 interval . to restore the dimensions we have to divide @xmath66 by @xmath67 .",
    "thus , in going from @xmath56  gev to @xmath68  gev , the expected leading - order qcd @xmath22 background increases by a factor of 240 in comparison with that for @xmath69 gev .    strictly speaking",
    ", there are other sources of background  @xcite .",
    "there is the possibility of the gluon jet being misidentified as either a @xmath3 or a @xmath23 jet , or a contribution from the nlo @xmath70 subprocess , where the extra gluon is not separated from either a @xmath3 or a @xmath23 jet .",
    "these contributions have no @xmath71 suppression , and hence increase only as @xmath72 , and not as @xmath73 , with decreasing @xmath74 .",
    "for @xmath56  gev , the lo @xmath22 qcd production was only about 30% of the total background .",
    "however , for @xmath75  gev , the lo @xmath22 contribution dominates . finally , with the cuts of ref .",
    "@xcite , we predict that the cross section of the @xmath2 signal is of the recoil protons in the gluon loop of fig.1 . for smaller boson masses , @xmath76 gev ,",
    "this leads to a steeper @xmath77 dependence of the amplitude , which emphasizes larger values of the impact parameter , @xmath78 , where the absorptive effects are weaker .",
    "therefore we obtain a larger soft survival factor , @xmath79 , at the lhc energy . however , recall that a factor of 2 difference is within the accuracy of the approach@xcite . ] @xmath80 as compared to the qcd background cross section , with the same cuts - tagging efficiencies and the missing mass resolution in the case of a light higgs boson are the same as for the case of @xmath81  gev @xcite .",
    "likely , this assumption is not well justified . in particular , the missing mass resolution and proton tagging efficiency may worsen at lower masses .",
    "] , of @xmath82 that is the signal - to - background ratio is only @xmath83 , and so even for an integrated luminosity @xmath84 for @xmath85  gev the significance of the signal is only @xmath86 .",
    "here we have taken a @xmath87 factor of @xmath88 for the qcd @xmath22 background , and again used the cuts and efficiencies quoted in ref.@xcite . therefore , to identify a light higgs ,",
    "it is desirable to study a decay mode other than @xmath26 .",
    "the next largest mode is @xmath27 , with a branching fraction of about 0.07 .",
    "the dependence of the results on the mass of the @xmath2 higgs boson is illustrated in table 1 .",
    "clearly the cross section decreases with increasing mass . on the other hand the signal - to - background ratio increases .",
    "therefore for the case @xmath89  gev we see a slightly improved statistical significance of @xmath90 for the @xmath22 decay mode .",
    ".the cross sections ( in fb ) of the central _ exclusive _ diffractive production of @xmath91 neutral higgs bosons , together with those of the qcd(@xmath22 ) and qed(@xmath92 ) backgrounds .",
    "the acceptance cuts applied are ( a )  the polar angle cut @xmath93 in the higgs rest frame , ( b )  @xmath94  mev for the forward outgoing protons and ( c )  the polar angle cut @xmath95 .",
    "the azimuthal asymmetries @xmath96 are defined in eq.(12 ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have evaluated the cross sections , and the corresponding backgrounds , for the central double - diffractive production of the ( three neutral ) cp - violating higgs bosons at the lhc .",
    "this scenario is of interest since even a very light boson of mass about 30 gev is not experimentally ruled out for some range of the mssm parameters .",
    "we have studied the production of the three states , @xmath97 , both with exclusive kinematics , @xmath24 which we denoted cedp , and in double - diffractive reactions where both the incoming protons may be destroyed , @xmath98 which we denoted cdd . recall that a + sign denotes the presence of a large rapidity gap .",
    "proton taggers are required in the former processes , but not in the latter .",
    "typical results are summarised in tables 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the cross sections are not large , but should be accessible at the lhc .",
    "the uncertainties in the calculation of the exclusive cross sections were discussed in refs.@xcite . for the light @xmath2 boson , where the contribution from the low @xmath99 region is more important",
    ", the uncertainty is much larger . recall that for the semi - inclusive cdd processes the effective gluon - gluon ( @xmath100 ) luminosity",
    "is calculated using the lo formula .",
    "thus we can not exclude rather large nlo corrections . on the other hand , for cdd",
    ", the values of the cross sections are practically insensitive to the contributions from the infrared domain . moreover , with the _ skewed _ cdd kinematics , the nlo bfkl corrections are expected to be much smaller than in the forward ( cedp ) case .",
    "so we may expect an uncertainty of the predictions to be about a factor of 3 to 4 , or even better .",
    "it would be very informative to measure the azimuthal angular dependence of the outgoing proton systems , for both the cedp and cdd processes .",
    "such measurements would reveal explicitly any cp - violating effect , via the interference of the scalar and pseudoscalar @xmath38 vertices .",
    "finally , we recall the advantages of diffractive , as compared to the non - diffractive , production of higgs bosons :    \\i ) a much better mass higgs resolution is obtained by the missing mass method for exclusive events ,    \\ii ) a clean environment , which may be important to identify four @xmath3-jets with transverse momenta @xmath101 gev ( for the non - diffractive process , at the lhc energy , the qcd backgroud may be too large ) ,    \\iii ) a possibility to measure cp - property of the higgs boson and to detect cp - violation ( note that the asymmetries @xmath102 and @xmath103 are explicit manifestations of cp violation at the quark level ) ,    next , assuming that p and c parities are conserved ,    \\iv ) the existence of the p - even , @xmath44 selection rule for lo central exclusive diffractive production , which means that we observe an object of natural parity ( most probably @xmath104 ) ; the analysis of the azimuthal angular distribution of the outgoing protons may give additional information about the spin of the centrally produced object  @xcite ,    \\v ) in addition we know that an object produced by the diffractive process ( that is by pomeron - pomeron fusion ) has positive c - parity , is an isoscalar and a colour singlet resonance@xcite .",
    "a knowledge of its c - parity is important to understand its nature .",
    "if it is a c = + 1 state with spin - parity @xmath104 or @xmath105 then it may be even seen in cdd production with a large rapidity gap on either side of its j/@xmath106 decay .",
    "forward proton tagging would , of course , allow a better spin - parity analysis . ] .    the properties listed above should help to distinguish the @xmath4 and @xmath5 four - jet decay channels from the production of a susy particle , followed by a ` cascade'-like decay .",
