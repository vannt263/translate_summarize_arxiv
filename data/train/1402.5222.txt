    "the study of the exotic hadrons provides us with unique opportunities to explore fundamental properties of the low energy qcd , such as color confinement , the chiral symmetry breaking , etc .",
    "recently , in the heavy flavor ( charm and bottom ) sectors , experimental evidences for new candidates of exotic hadrons , such as x , y , z , have been reported , and these states are extensively investigated in theoretical works  @xcite . although there have been many theoretical studies based on various pictures such as multiquarks , hybrids of quarks and gluons , multi - hadrons , and so on , we have not yet understood the essential features of exotic heavy hadrons . in the present article , we approach the structure of the hadronic molecules with a heavy quark from a point of view of the heavy quark symmetry ( hqs )  @xcite , namely the symmetry of the heavy - quark spin , as the fundamental property of heavy hadrons .    in general , for hadrons with a single heavy quark , the hqs leads to the mass degeneracy of two states with different total spin in the heavy quark limit .",
    "this is because the spin of the heavy quark is decoupled from the total spin of the other components made of light quarks and gluons .",
    "the latter component is called the brown muck , which is everything but the heavy quark .",
    "it is important to note that the brown muck has the conserved total spin @xmath3 , although the brown muck is a non - perturbative object which is dressed by many quarks and gluons like @xmath4 with a net quark number @xmath5 . for @xmath6 , the spin degeneracy in the heavy hadrons",
    "is realized by the pair states with the total angular momenta , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we call those two states the  hqs doublet . \" for @xmath9 , there is only one state with @xmath10 .",
    "we call this state the  hqs singlet . \"",
    "the hqs is seen in the mass spectrum of the charm and bottom hadrons .",
    "for example , the mass splitting between @xmath11 @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xmath14 mesons is 140 mev , and that between @xmath15 and @xmath16 meson is 45 mev  @xcite .",
    "those mass splittings are smaller than ones between @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 mev ) and that between @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 mev ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath11 and @xmath13 ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) mesons are approximately regarded as the hqs doublet states . in those cases ,",
    "the brown muck is a light quark @xmath23 , which is dressed by quark - antiquark pairs and gluons , with spin and parity @xmath24 in total .",
    "similar mass degeneracy of hqs doublets is also seen in the baryonic sector .",
    "the mass splitting between @xmath25 @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xmath28 ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) baryons is 65 mev ( 20 mev ) , which is smaller than 192 mev between @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 with @xmath10 in the ground state are regarded as the hqs singlet states , because there is no nearby @xmath35 partner .",
    "recently , two excited bottom baryons @xmath36 have been observed at lhcb  @xcite .",
    "although the quantum numbers are not settled yet , assigning @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) for the state with the lower ( higher ) mass , we see that the mass splitting between @xmath39 and @xmath40 is 33 mev and that between @xmath41 and @xmath42 is only 8 mev .",
    "those mass splittings can be compared with 115 mev between @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the brown muck in a heavy baryon with one heavy quark and two light quarks has the same quantum number as a pair of two quarks @xmath45 .",
    "the cluster of two quarks is called diquark in the constituent picture of the quark model . because two quarks can have many possible quantum numbers , such as isospin , total angular momentum and parity @xmath46",
    ", we can investigate a variety of properties of diquarks in the heavy baryons .",
    "the diquark in @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) has @xmath49 .",
    "the diquark in @xmath25 @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xmath28 ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) has @xmath50 .",
    "the diquark in @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) has @xmath51 .",
    "the analysis of the brown muck in heavy hadrons will also be useful to understand the role of diquarks , not only in the confinement phase , but also in the deconfinement phase , e.g. the quark - gluon plasma @xcite and the color superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the hqs has been also successfully applied to several excited hadrons with charm and bottom flavors  @xcite .",
    "it is also relevant to understand the properties of exotic hadrons with hidden charm or bottom quarks @xcite .",
    "we have pointed out in ref .  @xcite that the hqs is seen also in multi - hadron systems with a heavy quark .",
    "let us consider a hadronic molecule ( or hadron composite ) , where a heavy hadron is surrounded by light hadrons to form bound and/or scattering states including resonances .",
    "when the hqs holds , we can use spin degrees of freedom to classify states ; the total spin of the hadronic molecule is decomposed into the heavy - quark spin and the total spin of the brown muck  @xcite .",
    "the latter has three contributions , namely , a sum of ( i ) the spins of the light quarks and gluons in the heavy hadron , ( ii ) the spins of the light hadrons surrounding the heavy hadron and ( iii ) the relative angular momenta between the heavy hadron and the light hadrons .",
    "this particular form of the brown muck is called the light spin - complex ( or spin - complex in short ) , because it is a composite object of light quarks , gluons and light hadrons having the total spin as a conserved quantum number .",
    "it is important to note that the quark - gluon degrees of freedom ( i ) coexist with the hadronic degrees of freedom ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "let us show examples for the spin - complex .",
    "first we consider a @xmath52 bound state composed of a heavy meson @xmath53 and a nucleon @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is a heavy antiquark and @xmath23 is a light component in @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath23 is not simply a single light quark but rather a composite of light quarks and gluons with appropriate quantum numbers in total .",
    "then , the spin - complex for the @xmath52 is denoted by @xmath57 $ ] , which is a composite object of the light component @xmath23 , the nucleon @xmath54 and the relative angular momentum between @xmath56 and @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath56 molecule has also been considered for the dibaryons of @xmath58 , where the spin - complex is identified with @xmath59 $ ] @xcite . yet , another example is the @xmath56 meson embedded in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the spin - complex there is identified with a sum of @xmath23 in @xmath56 and many pairs of the particle ( nucleon ) @xmath54 and the hole @xmath60 generated around the fermi surface .",
    "the spin - complex provides a new picture for a certain class of brown muck , which is useful in particular for the analysis of hadronic molecules .",
    "it is regarded as a colored effective degree of freedom inside hadrons , just as the constituent quarks and diquarks are .",
    "it should be noted , however , that there is a subtle issue for a criterion about how to separate the spin - complex from other components of the brown muck .",
    "the problem is essentially the same with the difficulty to define the structure of hadrons , such as compact multi - quarks and/or extended hadronic molecules , in a model - independent manner @xcite .",
    "therefore , the spin - complex is unambiguously defined only when the model space is specified . nevertheless , in this paper",
    ", we will show that the spin - complex is a powerful tool to classify the structure of hadrons .    before closing the introduction ,",
    "we mention the mass spectrum of the brown muck as the color non - singlet objects  @xcite .",
    "the brown muck is a colored object being ( anti-)fundamental representation of the color symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , it is a well - defined object characterized by its spin - parity and light flavor quantum numbers in the heavy quark limit .",
    "we expect that the brown muck exhibits a rich pattern in mass spectrum , because of its internal structure .",
    "for example , the brown muck in the excited hadrons is heavier than that in the ground state hadrons .",
    "the mass of the brown muck can be defined in the heavy quark limit with the help of the hadron mass formula in the heavy quark effective theory . in this paper",
    ", we will show that the mass of the brown muck can be extracted from the hqs multiplets both in the charm and bottom sectors .",
    "thus , with the heavy hadron spectrum , we can perform the spectroscopy of the color non - singlet object .",
    "the study of spin - complexes will be useful to interpret the spectrum of the brown muck in hadronic molecules with a heavy hadron .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : general ] , we briefly review the hqs and introduce the idea of the spin - complex , and give a general discussion for the wave function of the brown muck . in section  [ sec : examples_exotic ] , we show that the spin - complex can be used to classify the structure of hadrons , with the example of the exotic baryons with a heavy antiquark in a potential model .",
    "the present discussion includes the part of the results in our previous work in ref .  @xcite . in section  [ sec : spectrum ] , we discuss the mass spectrum of the brown muck extracted from the experimental data as well as from the predictions in a quark model . summary and perspectives are given in the last section .",
    "in this section , we introduce the spin - complex as a convenient tool to express the brown muck , starting from the hqs in qcd .",
    "we show that a heavy hadron with the total spin @xmath61 may have two components with different spin - complex of spin @xmath62 .",
    "they can be mixed for a finite heavy quark mass , but are decoupled in the heavy quark limit . the spin - complex basis",
    "is then related to the particle basis , from which the wave functions of the pair states in the hqs doublet are analyzed in terms of the hadronic degrees of freedom .",
    "explicit examples of these components will be given for the @xmath63 system in section  [ sec : examples_exotic ] .",
    "the hqs leads to the systematic expansion of the hadron mass in the inverse powers of the heavy quark mass .",
    "this expansion enables us to define the mass of the brown muck , and hence that of the spin - complex , in the heavy quark limit .",
    "we present the basic formula which will be used , in section  [ sec : spectrum ] , to extract the spectrum of the brown muck from the experimental data and theoretical predictions with a finite heavy quark mass .",
    "we consider that the heavy quark mass @xmath64 is much larger than a typical energy scale of low energy qcd . in this case ,",
    "an effective field theory with the @xmath65 expansion is useful to study the hadrons containing a single heavy quark @xcite . to this end , let us start our discussion first with the heavy quark lagrangian ; @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the heavy quark field , the covariant derivative is defined by @xmath68 with the gluon field @xmath69 , the gauge coupling @xmath70 , and @xmath71 with the gell - mann matrices @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the term from light quark and gluon sectors is not relevant in the current discussion . denoting the four - velocity of the heavy quark as @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) , we decompose the heavy quark field into the positive energy component @xmath76 and the negative energy component @xmath77 as @xmath78 by the projections @xmath79 here we remove the momentum @xmath80 in the original field @xmath81 and leave only the residual momenta .",
    "we multiply the projection operators @xmath82 to select the positive ( negative ) energy component . in the following discussion , we abbreviate the coordinate  @xmath83 \" in the field . by eliminating @xmath84 , we obtain the effective lagrangian for @xmath85 , @xmath86 with @xmath87 , @xmath88/ig_{\\mathrm{s}}$ ] , and @xmath89/2 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath90 is the wilson coefficient for the matching with qcd at the energy scale @xmath91 .",
    "this is the effective lagrangian in the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite . in the heavy quark",
    "mass limit @xmath92 , only the first term of eq",
    ".   remains and the spin - flip terms involved in @xmath93 are suppressed by @xmath65 .",
    "this indicates that the spin of the heavy quark is a conserved quantity , which is known as the hqs .",
    "we will see that the @xmath65 expansion and the hqs are essential also for heavy hadrons .",
    "we now consider the consequences of the hqs in hadronic systems .",
    "we are interested in hadrons either with a single heavy quark @xmath94 or with a single heavy antiquark @xmath95 , and with arbitrary baryon number @xmath15 . in qcd",
    ", such state may be expressed by a superposition of various components with light quarks ( @xmath23 ) and gluons ( @xmath96 ) as @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( negative @xmath5 represents the number of antiquarks , @xmath100 ) .",
    "we then decompose the total spin of this hadron @xmath101 into the spin @xmath102 of the heavy ( anti-)quark and the spin @xmath103 of the rest which contains only light degrees of freedom ; @xmath104 as shown in the previous subsection , the heavy - quark spin @xmath102 is conserved in the heavy quark limit . since the total @xmath101 is conserved , the total spin @xmath103 of the light system is also conserved in the heavy quark limit .    for a single hadron system @xmath105 , the object which carries the total spin @xmath103",
    "is called `` brown muck '' , which is everything but the heavy quark  @xcite . in the present discussion ,",
    "we introduce a notation @xmath106_{f , j^{\\cal p } } = q^{n } + q^{n}q\\bar{q } + q^{n}g + \\dots , \\label{eq : notation_bm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to express the state of the brown muck @xmath107 with total @xmath5 quarks , whose quantum numbers are given by the structure of light flavor @xmath108 and the total spin - parity @xmath109 .",
    "for example , when the light flavor @xmath110 symmetry is a good symmetry , @xmath108 denotes the representation of the @xmath110 symmetry . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : notation_bm ] ) , the weight of each component depends on @xmath107 .",
    "we note that , as indicated in eqs .   and , the brown muck is a highly non - perturbative object made of light quarks and gluons .",
    "the brown muck belongs to the color ( anti-)triplet , so the strong interaction is at work between the heavy ( anti-)quark and the brown muck .",
    "nevertheless , the total spin @xmath103 of the brown muck is well defined through eq .   and conserved in the heavy quark limit . in other words , all the interactions which flip @xmath103 ( and hence flip the spin of the heavy quark @xmath102 ) are suppressed in the heavy quark limit , while the interaction which does not flip the spin , such as color electric force , is still active .",
    "in this way , the conservation of @xmath103 of the brown muck is realized .",
    "in addition , the light - flavor quantum numbers ( isospin and strangeness ) of the brown muck are identical to those of the heavy hadron , because the heavy quark does not carry them .",
    "thus , the brown muck is a well - defined object in the heavy quark limit , characterized by its spin - parity and light flavors .",
    "we emphasize that this viewpoint is useful , not only for theoretical researches , but also for experimental researches in realistic situations with finite heavy quark mass , as we will discuss later .    for normal hadrons like @xmath111 mesons and @xmath112 baryons ,",
    "the brown mucks are composed of quarks and gluons .",
    "however , this situation may change for exotic hadrons .",
    "it has been pointed out that , in the heavy sector , there can be hadronic states as ensembles of multiple color singlet objects .",
    "for instance , hadronic molecules which are loosely bound systems of hadrons can be generated by inter - hadron forces , even in the exotic sector  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are investigations on nuclei with heavy hadrons  @xcite which consists of a heavy hadron and several nucleons . in these cases ,",
    "`` everything but the heavy quark '' is not simply made of quarks and gluons , but a mixture of quark - gluon components and hadronic degrees of freedom . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we proposed to call it `` light spin - complex '' ( or `` spin - complex '' in short ) to express the composite system of quarks , gluons and hadrons . before discussing the structure of the spin - complex , however , we will first discuss the general property of the brown muck in the next subsection .",

    "also , the brown muck of a @xmath120 bound state with @xmath121 can have the spin - complex @xmath57_{i=0,0^{+}}^{(1,{\\rm s})}$ ] which stands for the system made of a nucleon @xmath54 and @xmath23 , with total spin combined into triplet and relative angular momentum being s - wave as denoted by @xmath122 in the superscript .",
    "in general , several different components @xmath114 $ ] can contribute to each brown muck , because @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the only well - defined quantum numbers .",
    "for practical analysis the brown muck can be expanded by a suitable basis , for instance , by the diquark basis for heavy baryons and by the spin - complex basis for hadronic molecules .",
    "we introduce a term  brown - muck component ( bmc ) \" to indicate the component concretely given by particular objects like diquarks and/or spin - complexes .",

    "it should be noted that for a given @xmath164 , it is not necessary that both @xmath139 and @xmath138 form a hadronic state , because they are made of different brown muck , and it is not necessary that both of them are stable . on the other hand , if a hadron with spin @xmath164 exists in the @xmath139 ( @xmath138 ) channel , there must be a partner @xmath141 ( @xmath148 ) with the different total spin @xmath140 ( @xmath174 ) .",
    "the existence of the hqs doublet in the heavy quark limit leads to an important phenomenological consequence ; if we observe a hadron with spin @xmath164 , there can be a spin partner with spin @xmath175 with a similar mass , except for the hqs singlet of @xmath10 .",
    "in general , the observed hadron with spin @xmath164 can be either @xmath139 or @xmath138 , but the difference of @xmath139 and @xmath138 is seen in the wave function .",
    "such difference should be reflected in the production and decay properties .    in the present discussion ,",
    "the structure of the brown muck is not specified at all , meaning that the spin degeneracy occurs in the heavy quark limit irrespective of the structure of the brown muck .",
    "thanks to this generality , the discussions in this section can be applied not only to conventional hadrons but also to exotic hadrons , multi - hadron states , and their mixtures .      in many discussions of hadronic composites ,",
    "the wave functions are expressed by the particle basis , namely the relative wave functions between hadrons . in this subsection",
    "we show a transformation of hadronic states written in terms of a brown muck and a heavy quark to those of a physical particle basis .",
    "let us start with an expansion of a hadron state @xmath126 in terms of a physical particle basis .",
    "for example , a heavy baryon state with minimal quark configuration @xmath176 can be expanded as @xmath177 where the first term corresponds to the `` bare '' heavy baryon state with spin @xmath164 .",
    "the bare state does not include the meson - cloud effect , which is represented by the two - body channels in the second ( third ) term ; a heavy meson @xmath178 and a light baryon @xmath15 ( a light meson @xmath179 and a heavy baryon @xmath180 ) with relative spin and angular momentum @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "the expansion may also include several @xmath183 and @xmath184 channels , as well as many - hadron channels .",
    "the physical hadron including all the virtual states can also be decomposed into the spin - complex basis  .",
    "then , we can relate the particle basis   with the spin - complex basis by a unitary matrix @xmath185 as @xmath186_{j-1/2}q \\",
    ", \\right\\rangle}_{j } \\\\      { \\left| \\ , [ \\alpha_{2}]_{j-1/2}q \\ , \\right\\rangle}_{j } \\\\      \\vdots \\\\      { \\left| \\ , [ \\beta_{1}]_{j+1/2}q \\ , \\right\\rangle}_{j } \\\\      { \\left| \\ , [ \\beta_{2}]_{j+1/2}q \\ , \\right\\rangle}_{j } \\\\      \\vdots \\\\      \\end{pmatrix }   .",
    "\\label{eq : transformation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] each element of the matrix @xmath185 can be obtained by the rearrangement of the quark structure .",
    "note that the transformation matrix @xmath185 is determined , only when the model space is explicitly specified . in section  [ sec : examples_exotic ] , we will show the examples of the basis transformations of an exotic hadron with a @xmath111 heavy meson for @xmath178 and a nucleon @xmath54 for @xmath15 .",
    "the consequences of the hqs become clear by this basis transformation .",
    "let us suppose that the hamiltonian @xmath187 of the system with total spin @xmath164 is defined in the particle basis .",
    "using the transformation matrix @xmath185 , we then obtain the hamiltonian in the bmc basis @xmath188 as @xmath189 in order to realize the separation of @xmath190 components in eq .  , the hamiltonian in the bmc basis should be block - diagonalized in the heavy quark limit @xmath191 as we will see below , the block - diagonalization of the hamiltonian is indeed possible , as far as the hamiltonian @xmath187 is constructed in accordance with the hqs .",
    "note that the off - diagonal terms within each @xmath192 are not constrained by the hqs , and it is this term that determines the coefficients @xmath171 in the bound state wave function  .",
    "the relation to @xmath193 is also seen in the bmc basis .",
    "the hamiltonian with spin @xmath140 in the heavy quark limit can be block - diagonalized into @xmath194 with @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "the degeneracy of @xmath197 and @xmath193 requires @xmath198 strictly , it is sufficient for us that eigenvalues in the two hamiltonian are the same . to express this ,",
    "we introduce @xmath199 as @xmath200 in the sense that the eigenvalues of @xmath201 are as same as those of @xmath202 .",
    "for instance , the signs of the off - diagonal components are irrelevant for the eigenvalues .",
    "we will see that this happens in the case of the exotic hadron in section  [ sec : examples_exotic ] .",
    "thus , the diagonalization in eqs .   and and the coincidence of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "are the consequence of the hqs of the hamiltonian in the bmc basis .",
    "the particle basis is also useful to analyze the wave function of the eigenstates .",
    "for instance , the state @xmath139 given by the brown muck in eq .",
    "is expressed by the particle basis as @xmath203 with @xmath204 the weights @xmath205 ( @xmath206 , @xmath183 , @xmath207 ,  , @xmath184 , @xmath208 ,  ) represents the probability of finding the state @xmath209 in the eigenstate wave function . because the transformation matrix @xmath185 is determined only by the symmetry argument , the structure of the eigenstate is specified once the wave function is determined in terms of the brown muck @xmath139 .",
    "so far we have discussed the symmetry aspects of heavy hadrons . in the end of this section , we discuss some dynamical aspects , and evaluate the mass of the brown muck , which is also useful to the study of the spin - complex in the heavy quark limit .    in order to define the mass of the brown muck , we decompose the mass of the heavy hadron in terms of @xmath65 . based on the effective lagrangian ( [ eq : hqet ] ) , we can expand the mass of the hadron h containing a heavy quark q as  @xcite @xmath210 where we define , in the rest frame with @xmath211 , @xmath212 with denoting the hadron state by @xmath213 .",
    "the factor @xmath214 is multiplied due to the normalization of the wave function @xmath215 . here @xmath216 is the hamiltonian obtained from the leading ( first ) term in @xmath217 ( [ eq : hqet ] ) and the light degrees of freedom . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chromomagnetic0 ] ) , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the operators for the spin of the heavy quark q and the total spin of the brown muck @xcite , respectively .",
    "the dependence of @xmath91 on @xmath218 originates from the wilson coefficient @xmath90 , because the matching with qcd is done at the energy scale @xmath219  @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath220 and @xmath221 for charm and bottom , respectively .",
    "the expansion   is useful to analyze the qcd properties in heavy hadrons .",
    "in fact , @xmath222 , @xmath223 and @xmath224 are concerned with the scale anomaly in qcd @xcite , the chromoelectric gluons @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and the chromomagnetic gluons , respectively .",
    "there are discussions to utilize the heavy hadrons to probe the gluon dynamics in the ( multi-)hadron systems and nuclear systems with a heavy hadron @xcite .",
    "now we consider the heavy quark limit where the mass of the hadron h is given by @xmath225 .",
    "we notice that there is no spin dependence , as required by the hqs .",
    "in addition , we have defined the brown muck as everything except for the heavy quark , and the mixing with other @xmath3 components vanishes in the heavy quark limit .",
    "thus , we shall identify @xmath222 as the mass of the brown muck .",
    "we will discuss the way to extract @xmath222 from the experimental spectrum as well as from the prediction of theoretical models of heavy hadrons in section  [ sec : spectrum ] .",
    "for the formalism given in the previous section , we will give concrete examples of spin - complex .",
    "we consider exotic baryons with a heavy antiquark with the minimal quark configuration @xmath226 , and discuss the two - body states whose model space is supplied by a heavy meson and a nucleon .",
    "this state is exotic , because it can not be reduced to the normal baryons with three quarks as a minimal valence component . in section  [ sec : decomposition ]",
    ", we will analytically decompose the meson - baryon basis into the spin - complex basis , and show that the hqs doublets / singlets appear . in section  [ sec : model ] , we will discuss results by the one - pion exchange potential from the heavy meson effective theory in analytical and numerical calculations , including the @xmath65 corrections .",
    "we discuss the spin structures of exotic baryons with @xmath226 . in the current discussion",
    ", we assume that there exist exotic baryons which are composed of a heavy meson @xmath227 or @xmath228 and a nucleon @xmath54 . here",
    "@xmath56 stands for @xmath229 or @xmath230 .",
    "was used to mean @xmath111 . ] since the @xmath229 and @xmath230 belongs to the same hqs doublet , we consider the coupled - channel problem of @xmath231 and @xmath232 and denote their superposition as @xmath52 .",
    "we do not include three- or many - hadron channels , higher energy excited channels , and possible compact five - quark states .",
    "the exotic baryon is then considered to have a hadronic molecule structure , and the corresponding brown muck is identified as a spin - complex of a quark @xmath23 and a nucleon @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath52 states are classified by the quantum numbers : total spin @xmath164 , parity @xmath233 and isospin @xmath234 .",
    "the relevant channels for given quantum numbers @xmath113 up to @xmath235 are summarized in table  [ tab : channel ] . as emphasized in refs .",
    "@xcite , the state mixing between @xmath231 and @xmath232 is important due to the mass degeneracy of @xmath231 and @xmath232 in heavy quark limit .",
    "moreover , the states with angular momenta @xmath182 and @xmath236 can be also mixed by the tensor force . in",
    "what follows , we discuss the transformation of the particle basis to the spin - complex basis ( the bmc basis spanned exclusively by the spin - complex channels ) .",
    "the isospin indices will be suppressed , which does not affect the basis transformation .        using the wave function of the spin - complex basis",
    ", we can extract the ratio of the @xmath237 component as in section  [ sec : fractions ] .",
    "the wave function of the hqs singlet in the non - exotic sector is @xmath238 and the @xmath37 part of the hqs doublet is @xmath239 the mixing ratio of the wave function is reflected in the coupling strength @xmath240 obtained from the residue of the pole .",
    "the hqs implies that the ratios of the coupling strengths should be @xmath241 in the heavy quark limit . in table",
    "[ tbl : coupling ] we show the ratios of the coupling strengths of the ground states in refs .",
    "@xcite together with the values in the heavy quark limit .",
    "we see that the actual coupled - channel calculation with finite @xmath64 provides the coupling strengths similar to the values indicated by the hqs .",
    "in addition , the ratio of the coupling constants approaches the value in the heavy quark limit as the quark mass is increased from charm to bottom . in this way , the spin - complex basis provides a new insight into the calculations in the charm and bottom sectors .",
