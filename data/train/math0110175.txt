    "zeta functions on the sphere ( and in general on a closed riemannian manifold ) were first introduced by minakshisundaram and peijel as extensions of the classical riemann zeta function @xcite .",
    "an analytic definition , by a mellin transform of the trace of the heat operator associated to the laplacian in the standard metric , shows how the residua at the poles are given by the coefficients in the asymptotic expansion of the trace of the heat operator @xcite .",
    "such an expansion can be obtained in a large number of cases using global analysis @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , and in particular the first coefficients in the case of the laplacian on a riemannian manifold can be computed using local invariants associated to the curvature tensor @xcite .",
    "the constant term , that corresponds to the value of the zeta function at the origin , is important in physics @xcite and in conformal theory @xcite , being associated to the conformal anomaly . on the other hand ,",
    "the derivative of the zeta function at the origin gives the atiyah regularized determinant of the laplacian @xcite .",
    "early approaches to calculate these quantities give explicit results for the 2 sphere @xcite @xcite , while more recently an explicit formula for the residua has been obtained in @xcite for the @xmath0-sphere , using a result that allows to write a dirichlet series as a sum of classical hurwitz zeta functions @xcite .",
    "this method fails to compute the derivative , but an alternative one is provided by @xcite , where a factorization theorem for zeta regularized products is introduced and explicit results for the low dimensional spheres are given .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show how these zeta functions can be treated very easily by classical methods using a hermite type formula , in exactly the same way as for the one dimensional case of the riemann ( hurwitz ) zeta function .",
    "this approach allows us to deal not only with the zeta function on the spheres , but also with the zeta function on the real and complex projective spaces .",
    "for all these cases , we localize the poles and give explicit formulas for the residua .",
    "we show that the origin @xmath1 is a regular point , and compute the value of the zeta function together with the value of its first derivative at @xmath1 .",
    "the main feature of this approach is that it can be used more generally to deal with the zeta function of any operator whose eigenvalues are explicitly known with their multiplicity .",
