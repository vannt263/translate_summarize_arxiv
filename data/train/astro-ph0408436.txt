    "the nature of the progenitors of celestial gamma  ray bursts ( grbs ) is a still open issue .",
    "collapse of massive fast rotating stars ( hypernova model , e.g. , paczynski 1998 ) or delayed collapse of a rotationally stabilized neutron star ( supranova model , vietri & stella 1998 ) are among the favoured scenarios for the origin of these events .",
    "both models predict that the pre - burst environment consists of a high density gas , due to strong winds from the massive progenitor in the case of a hypernova or to a substantial enrichment of heavy elements by a previous supernova explosion ( sn ) in the case of the supranova model ( lazzati et al .",

    "the recent discovery , from the spectral evolution of the optical afterglow emission from grb030329 , of a direct connection between this burst and the type ic energetic supernova ( hypernova ) sn2003dh ( e.g. , stanek et al . 2003 , hjorth et al . 2003 ) seems to point toward the hypernova model , even if the strict simultaneity of the two events has not been fully proved .",
    "it is however not yet clear whether all grbs are connected with energetic supernovae , lacking in many cases evidence of supernova spectroscopic features and/or a supernova bump in the optical emission of grb afterglows . on the other hand , from the current estimates of the opening angles of grb jets , the expected grb rates , when compared with those of sne type ib / c , suggest that less than 1% of such sne might be accompanied by a grb @xcite .",
    "the case of sn2002ap ( e.g. , wang et al .",
    "2003 ) is an outstanding example of type ic hypernova which has no simultaneous detected grb event associated with it .",
    "the presence of a post - supernova environment can be tested from the study of the burst x  ray spectrum , which should show a low - energy cutoff and/or absorption features due to elements in the circumburst material left by the previous supernova explosion . either the progressive photoionization of the neutral gas by the grb photons ( e.g. , bttcher et al .",
    "1999 ; lazzati & perna 2002 ) or the electron density decrease or the electron temperature increase of an already almost photoionized medium @xcite would make the features transient",
    ".    in fact a transient absorption feature at @xmath6  kev has been detected in the prompt emission x  ray spectrum of grb990705 @xcite .",
    "the feature is present in the first , rising part of the burst profile and disappears thereafter .",
    "interpreted by amati et al .",
    "( 2000 ) as a cosmologically redshifted k edge due to neutral fe around the grb location , a grb redshift of @xmath7 was derived and later confirmed by optical spectroscopy of the associated host galaxy ( @xmath8 = 0.84 , le foch et al .",
    "2002 ) . with this assumption ,",
    "the iron relative abundance with respect to the solar one was derived , @xmath9 , which is typical of a supernova explosion environment .",
    "an alternative explanation was given by lazzati et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who assumed that the feature is an absorption line due to resonant scattering of grb photons on h - like iron ( transition 1s-2p , @xmath10 kev ) .",
    "also in this case the derived redshift is consistent with that of the host galaxy and the line width is interpreted as due to the outflow velocity dispersion ( up to  0.1c ) of the material , which should have a fe relative abundance of @xmath11 with respect to the solar one . in both scenarios , the observed feature points to the presence of an iron - rich environment left by a recent supernova explosion .",

    "rutledge and sako ( 2003 ) , examining the same data analyzed by reeves et al .",

    "we report the results of our findings and their possible interpretation .",

    "the background in the grbm energy band was estimated by linear interpolation using the 250  s count rate data before and after the burst .",
    "the wfc spectra were extracted through the iterative removal of sources procedure ( iros , e.g. jager et al .",

    "following the investigation performed on a sample of  grbs @xcite , we are performing the systematic analysis of all grb detected with the  wfcs and grbm , in order to study their spectral evolution in the 2700 kev energy band .",
    "our method is that of subdividing the pulse profile in a certain number of slices of duration such to derive statistically significant count spectra for each of them . for grb011211 , we subdivided the light curve in 3 intervals a , b , c ( see fig .  [",
    "f : lc ] ) , 100  s , 76  s , and 116  s duration , respectively .",
    "the derived 2700 kev count rate spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : sp ] .",
    "the surprise was the shape of the spectrum in the time interval a , which showed at a glance , between 6 and 8 kev , a structured depression , which was not apparent in the other two spectra , which exhibited the typical shape found in many other grbs .",
    "subdividing the 100  s interval in two sub - intervals , the count statistics were very low , but , in spite of that , the depression marginally appeared in both spectra . subdividing the interval b in two sub - intervals ,",
    "no trace of the feature was found in either spectra .",
    "the feature in the interval a is also evident ( see fig .  [",
    "f : crab_ratio ] ) when we perform the ratio of the grb count spectra with that of the crab nebula , which by chance was observed at an angular offset similar to that ( 9.1@xmath20 ) of grb011211 .",
    "the crab ratio criterion , commonly used to search for cyclotron resonance features in x - ray pulsars ( e.g. , dal fiume et al . 2000 ) , has the advantage of being independent of the detector response function adopted and thus minimizing the calibration uncertainties .",
    "we investigated a possible instrumental origin of this depression with negative results .",
    "the high - voltage , which is monitored every second , does not show any glitch in the interval a. given the accuracy of the readout ( which dominates over statistical noise ) this excludes gain changes higher than 0.01% .",
    "all the ratemeters show the grb event , even the ones that measure the illegal events , so there is nothing that can be concluded from them .",
    "there are no dips or spikes of any sort , with a typical 3@xmath26 upper limit of 10% per second of measurement ( for a count rate of 700 counts s@xmath27 ) .",
    "all monitored quantites at the time of the depression do not show anything out of the ordinary .",
    "finally , note that the same procedure was followed to extract both the spectrum a and the spectra b and c , in which the feature is not observed .",
    "as for the other events , the joint wfc and grbm count rate spectra a , b and c were analyzed by means of the xspec software package @xcite . in the fits , allowing the normalization factor of the grbm data with respect to the wfc data free to vary , we tested various continuum models : power - law ( pl ) , broken power - law ( bknpl ) and smoothly broken power - law ( or band law , bl , band et al .",
    "the pl model provided a good fit only with a grbm / wfc normalization factor of 0.3 which is unusually low . indeed , from extended flight calibrations with celestial sources ( e.g. , crab nebula ) and using grbs observed with both the wfc - grbm and the cgro / batse experiment ( e.g. , fishman et al .",
    "1994 ) , this factor was found to range from 0.8 to 1.3 .",
    "thus we excluded the pl model .",
    "the bl gave a good fit , but the best fit parameters derived were not constrained by the data .",
    "the best data description and the best parameter constraints were obtained with a bknpl , with best fit parameters reported in table  [ t : results ] . in the fits",
    "the grbm / wfc normalization factor was fixed to 0.8 , but we verified that the fit quality and the bknpl parameter values did not significantly change by using other values of this factor in the 0.81.3 range .",
    "we also took into account , in the fits , photoelectric absorption of the radiation from the grb , finding that the equivalent hydrogen column density @xmath28 was consistent with zero .",
    "thus we assumed a galactic absorption along the grb direction ( @xmath29  @xmath30 , dickey & lockman 1990 ) .    even if , for the interval a , the bknpl model already provides an acceptable fit ( @xmath31 corresponding to a chance probability of 0.57 , see table  [ t : results ] ) , the distribution of the residuals from the model ( see fig .  [",
    "f : residuals ] ) still shows evidence of the structured depression .",
    "the feature is still apparent in the residuals from the best fits with the other models ( pl and bl ) and is also evident when only the wfc data are fit with a pl model .",
    "the used models are those generally used to describe the prompt continuum emission from grbs",

    "( e.g. , barraud et al . 2003 ) , this possibility appears much less probable .",
    "thus we decided to evaluate from a statistical point of view the significance of the feature using the residuals from the bknpl best fit model . given that the @xmath33-test is a global test , which does not take into account the relative position of the residuals , we performed a null - hypothesis test to check the independence of the residuals around the depression ( see fig .",

    "taking the residuals to the bknpl as data points , we investigated the probability that groups of @xmath34 consecutive data points are mutually independent .",
    "conservatively the @xmath34 value was chosen to be the number of energy bins corrersponding to 4 times the energy resolution of the instrument in correspondence of the depression region .",
    "thus we considered values of @xmath34 ranging from 11 to 14 bins . for a chosen value of @xmath34 , we scanned the entire count spectrum , by moving the first bin of the group .",
    "we found that the probability that @xmath34 consecutive residuals from the bknpl model are mutually independent , ranges from about 0.16 to 0.47 when the energy bins are far from the depression , and from @xmath35 down to @xmath36 ( equivalent , in a gaussian approximation , to 2.83.1 @xmath26 ) , depending on @xmath34 , when the energy bins cover the depression region .",

    "now we have the possible evidence of another similar feature from grb011211 .",
    "also in this case , the feature is visible only during the rise of the primary event .",
    "however , in the case of grb011211 the interpretation is not so straightforward .",
    "first of all , the feature , due to its symmetrical shape , is more consistent with an absorption line than a k edge",
    ". also the assumption of a cyclotron resonance feature , which was the assumption for the origin of the _ ginga _ lines , appears untenable .",
    "if an oriented magnetic field were present in the emitting region , the magnetic field strength can be derived from the condition that the magnetic energy density integrated over the emission region of the prompt emission times a radiative efficiency factor ( likely not smaller than @xmath80 ) is at most equal to the estimated energy released ( see section  [ s : results ] ) .",

    "neither this large magnetic field seems to be compatible with the value derived from the analysis of the afterglow data @xcite using the standard homogeneous fireball model @xcite .",
    "the rest - frame energy of the absorption feature is also inconsistent with any plausible resonant scattering line unless we invoke a blue shift of the line .",
    "indeed the most abundant elements of typical interstellar environments or those typical of a supernova explosion have resonant scattering energies far below the rest  frame energy of the discovered feature ( see , e.g. , kato 1976 ) .",
    "this implies an absorbing medium with very high outflowing velocities @xmath85 . a lower limit to this velocity",

    "a possible explanation is that the absorption feature is due to outflowing material in the line of sight toward the jet cone ( see also knigl 2004 ) .",
    "the fit with the physical model allows us to estimate the distance of the absorber and the amount of absorbing material . from eq .",
    "12 of lazzati et al .",
    "( 2001 ) we derive : @xmath107 while the fit yields @xmath108  @xmath30 .",
    "assuming isotropy , the mass of the absorber results in @xmath109 , the total mass being @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the iron ( cobalt ) richness in solar units .",
    "this estimate implies a moderate iron and cobalt enriched material in order to keep the total mass to a reasonable value .",
    "alternatively , one can envisage a clumped material , with a covering factor much lower than unity , with a dense clump lying randomly along the line of sight .",
    "in addition , it is possible to derive the total energy involved in the outflow , from the best - fit average speed .",
    "we obtain @xmath112 $ ]  erg where @xmath113 is the covering factor of the clumps and @xmath114 is the solid angle within which the material is accelerated to the high speed obtained from the fit .",
    "reasonable values are @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , resulting in a large amount of kinetic energy @xmath118  erg , a value larger than the typical grb energy of @xmath119  erg @xcite .    given that any absorption feature in the grb prompt emission , specially during its rise , implies that the absorbing material is external to the fireball",
    ", there is only one model , among the proposed progenitors , which can accommodate this observation . in the supranova scenario",
    "@xcite a supernova explodes prior to the grb , ejecting high speed material around a newly formed rotating supra - massive neutron star .",
    "the grb is produced when the spin of the neutron star is reduced and the compact object collapses to a black hole . in the time span between the supernova and grb explosions , the spindown of the neutron star releases @xmath120 erg , of which a significant fraction could be in the form of a pulsar - type wind . as discussed in knigl & granot ( 2002 ) , this energy might be deposited in a pulsar - wind bubble and used to accelerate the supernova shell .",
    "they in fact argued that the swept - up remnant is likely to expand anisotropically , with the polar regions of the shell ( which can be identified with the gas responsible for the high - energy absorption detected in grb 011211 ) attaining speeds @xmath121 . , would be approximately equal to the ratio of their respective expansion speeds ( @xmath122 in this case ) .",
    "( 3 ) , this yields @xmath123 cm . ] on the other hand , explaining the presence of a large amount of high velocity absorbing material in the immediate vicinity of the burster is extremely problematic for any model invoking a simultaneous explosion of the burst with the progenitor star ( e.g. woosley 1993 ) , since the stellar wind creates an iron poor ( solar at most ) low - density environment at the required distance .    only more sensitive",
    "ray observations than those performed with the  wfcs can enlarge the grb sample , improve the statistical quality of the time resolved spectra , and thus test the results obtained with  on the x  ray transient absorption lines .",
    "these observations are expected to be only partly covered by the upcoming satellite _",
    "( e.g. , krimm 2004 given that these lines are observed only during the leading edge of the bursts , while the _ swift _ burst alert telescope has an energy passband from 15 to 150 kev .",
    "however _ swift _ can solve the issue of the hard x  ray lines observed with _",
    "ginga_. a sensitive mission which would be capable to observe the grb since their onset and to test the presence of transient x - ray lines with centroid energies below 10 kev could be the proposed _ lobster ",
    "iss _ for the international space station , an all - sky monitor with focusing optics from 0.1 to 3.5 kev @xcite paired with a grb monitor for higher photon energies , from 2 kev to several hundreds of kev @xcite .",
