    "recent data from type ia supernova ( sn ia ) @xcite and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation @xcite have provided strong evidences for a spatially flat and accelerating universe at the present time . in the context of friedmann - robertson - walker cosmology , this acceleration is attributed to the domination of a new matter component with negative pressure , dubbed dark energy @xcite .",
    "the simplest candidate for dark energy seems to be a remnant small cosmological constant or vacuum energy with @xmath0 .",
    "this energy scale @xmath1 ev is smaller than the known energy scales in particle physics except that of the neutrino masses , which is comparable to the scale of dark energy .",
    "the dark energy could also be due to a dynamical component , such as a canonical scalar field @xmath2 , named _ quintessence _",
    "cosmological observations indicate that the potential of the quintessence field should be very flat around the present epoch .",
    "consequently the effective mass should be extremely small , @xmath3 ev , which surprisingly is also connected to the neutrino masses _ via _ a see - saw formula @xmath4 , with @xmath5 being the planck mass .    are there any connections between the neutrinos and dark energy",
    "? given the arguments above it is quite interesting to make such a speculation on this connection .",
    "if yes , in terms of the language of particle physics , it requires the existence of new dynamics and new interactions between the neutrino and the dark energy sector .",
    "recently there are quite a few studies in the literature on the possible realization of the models connecting neutrinos and dark energy ) and ( 1).]@xcite .",
    "qualitatively these models have made at least two interesting predictions : 1 ) neutrino masses are not constant , but vary during the evolution of the universe ; 2 ) cpt is violated in the neutrino sector due to the cpt violating * ether * during the evolution of the quintessence scalar field@xcite .",
    "quantitatively these predictions will depend on the dynamics governing the coupled system of the neutrinos and dark energy .",
    "one of the possible couplings between the neutrinos and the scalar field is the derivative interaction@xcite : @xmath6 during the evolution of a homogeneous quintessence scalar field , @xmath7 does not vanish and gives rise to cpt violation in the neutrino sector .",
    "however , since @xmath7 is very small at the present epoch this type of cosmological cpt violation is predicted to be much smaller than the current experimental limits .",
    "but in the early universe with high temperature it has been shown in ref.@xcite that this cpt violation is large enough for the generation of the baryon number asymmetry via leptogenesis . this new mechanism @xcitefor",
    "baryogenesis / leptogenesis provides a unified picture for dark energy and baryon matter of the universe .",
    "another type of the interaction between the neutrinos and dark energy is that the quintessence field couples to the neutrino mass term . in the minimal extension of the standard model of particle physics",
    ", the neutrino masses can be described by a dimension-5 operator [ nu1 ] l_l = l_ll_lhh+h.c .  , where @xmath8 is the scale of new physics beyond the standard model which generates the @xmath9 violation , @xmath10 are the left - handed lepton and higgs doublets respectively .",
    "when the higgs field gets a vacuum expectation value @xmath11 , the left - handed neutrino receives a majorana mass @xmath12 . in ref .",
    "@xcite we considered an interaction between the neutrinos and the quintessence [ coupl ] l_int= l_ll_l h h+ h.c , where @xmath13 is the coefficient characterizing the strength of the interaction between quintessence and the neutrinos . in this scenario",
    "the neutrino masses vary during the evolution of the universe and the neutrino mass limits imposed by the baryogenesis are modified .",
    "the operator ( [ nu1 ] ) is not renormalizable , which in principle can be generated by integrating out the heavy particles .",
    "for example , in the model of the minimal see - saw mechanism @xcitefor the neutrino masses , we have _",
    "= h_ij|l_lin_rjh+ m_ij|n^c_rin_rj+h.c .  , where @xmath14 is the mass matrix of the right - handed neutrinos and the dirac mass of neutrinos is given by @xmath15 . integrating out the heavy right - handed neutrinos will generate the operator in ( [ nu1 ] ) .",
    "however , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , to make the light neutrino masses vary there are various possibilities , such as by coupling the quintessence field to the dirac masses and/or the majorana masses of the right - handed neutrinos . in ref.@xcite",
    "we have proposed a model of mass varying right - handed neutrinos . in this model",
    "the right - handed neutrino masses @xmath16 are assumed to be a function of the quintessence field @xmath17 . integrating out the right - handed neutrinos will generate a dimension-5 operator like in ( 3 ) , with the light neutrino masses varying in the following way [ exp ]",
    "l_l = e^- l_ll_l hh+ h.c . .",
    "in this paper we will give a systematic study on the effects for a coupled system of light neutrinos and the quintessence field , especially on the late - time evolution and the fate of the universe .",
    "we will show numerically that 1 ) unlike the case in the absence of the interaction the relic neutrino energy density @xmath18 may not decrease , instead it can track the energy density of the quintessence field . in the future , all of the pressureless matter may be diluted away and only the components of the neutrinos and quintessence remain .",
    "2 ) neutrino masses will increase as the universe expands , however when kinematically allowed the neutrinos will decay for instance into electrons and pion mesons . since the electrons and the mesons are not coupled to the dark sector , the fate of the universe is governed by the `` pure '' dynamics of the quintessence field . in this paper",
    "we will quantify the moment when the neutrinos decay by the numerical calculation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we will study the general features of the dark energy models with mass varying neutrinos and discuss analytically the behavior of the evolution of the system . in section",
    "iii we present the numerical results for some specific models .",

( [ coupl ] ) and ( [ exp ] ) . in this paper",
    "we consider mainly the models of neutrino coupling to the quintessence via the mass term .    as shown in eq.(6 ) different dark energy models are specified by the form of @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in this paper",
    "we will consider two classes of models , one has the exponential form of @xmath21 and @xmath22 and the other has the power law form . in this section",
    "we will give a general analysis of the behavior of the system and its condition for the attractor solution .",
    "the equation of motion for the scalar field @xmath2 is given by [ em ] + 3h++=0  , where [ sour ] = nis the source term by the interaction between the neutrinos and the scalar field , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 being the number density and energy of the neutrinos respectively , @xmath25 indicates the thermal average . for relativistic neutrinos , the term @xmath26 is greatly suppressed and the neutrinos decouple from quintessence . for non - relativistic neutrinos , the effective potential of the system is given by @xmath27 .    for this coupled system , the energy for each component does not conserve",
    "it is easy to get that the energy density of neutrinos evolutes as _",

    "correspondingly due to the conservation of energy - momentum tensor of the whole system , the fluid equation of the scalar field @xmath2 is _ + 3h_(1+w_)=-nm  , where @xmath29 is the equation of state of the scalar field .",

    "the effective equation of states @xmath30 and @xmath31 describe the actual rate of the energy density decrease of the two components respectively as the universe expands .",
    "when the two equation of states become equal we expect the two components to remain a constant ratio in energy densities . in the future when the energy densities of all other components of the universe dilute away and requiring @xmath33",

    "= +   , where we have set @xmath34 and used the relation @xmath35 .",
    "we can use the requirement of a constant ratio of the energy densities to derive the attractor solution of the system .",

    "this is the attractor solution given in ref .",

    "the exponential potential has very good attractor behavior and generically the coupled system is very close to the attractor region today and leads to a constant ratio of the two coupled components energy densities .",
    "this scenario seems to be less interesting to us , since the evolution of the universe is still dominated by the dynamics of the scalar field with a negligible neutrino component .    in the following",
    "we will consider a class of power law models where @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the two model parameters to be specified for the numerical calculations in the next section . in this class of models , @xmath47",

    "specifically we will focus on the power law models and on the behavior of the solution to the equation above , when @xmath2 tends to zero and @xmath49 tends to a constant .",
    "our results will show explicitly the importance of the neutrino component and the interaction with quintessence in determining the evolution and the fate of the universe .",
    "in this section , with the power law forms of interaction and potential , we will present our numerical results for the evolution of the coupled system given in eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) . we will show that this class of models can satisfy the observations within the model parameter space , furthermore predict different fates of the universe . at high temperatures ,",
    "the neutrinos are relativistic and decoupled from the scalar field , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ sour ] ) . at low temperatures ,",
    "the neutrinos begin to affect the evolutions of the scalar field .",
    "specifically we notice that the system will undergo a period of oscillation before entering the attractor region . in the period of oscillation ,",
    "the equation of state of neutrino can be below @xmath50 , so its energy density can grow up and become comparable with the scalar field or dark matter .",
    "therefore , the fate of the universe as we show below can be quite different from the dark energy model in the absence of the interaction with neutrinos .",
    "when neutrinos do not interact with dark energy , the density ratio between dark matter and neutrinos remains constant and typically dark energy will dominant the late time universe .",
    "however as shown below , the universe can be dominant with dark energy and neutrinos after introducing the interaction , with constant ratio of the energy densities of the two components .",
    "on the other hand , the universe can also be dominated by neutrinos and dark matter with negligible dark energy in another scenario . in the numerical study",

    "the universe will be dominated by the two components in the future and the ratio of the two components keeps constant for ever .",

    "when the oscillating amplitude is small enough the kinetic term of @xmath2 becomes negligible , i.e. @xmath76 , and @xmath72 tends to @xmath50 . for the power law form we will then have @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 . taking the model in fig .",

    "we mainly focus on the models where neutrinos can track dark energy .",

    "it is trivial if the system has entered the tracking regime today when the fraction of the neutrino energy density is negligible@xcite .",
    "meanwhile as the tracking regime has been kept in the * far * future from today , the mass of neutrinos has changed little till the present epoch due to the slow rolling of @xmath2 . in this sense",
    "our scenario is hard to distinguish experimentally from the standard case with constant neutrino masses . on the other hand , however , if we do not expect a neutrino dominant future universe and the present epoch is closer to the tracking regime , neutrino mass could have evolved from the past to now , as shown in the example of @xmath58 and @xmath59 in fig .",
    "we could then expect some distinguishable imprints from the uncoupled case@xcite .",
    "in addition , if the neutrino mass is produced through the seesaw mechanism and the scalar field only couples with the right - handed neutrinos , this scenario will change the predictions of the leptogenesis mechanism . as shown explicitly in ref .",
