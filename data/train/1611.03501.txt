    "cosmic  surveys of the distant universe have made enormous advances over the past two decades , since the launches of the _ chandra  observatory _ ( _ chandra _ ; e.g. , @xcite ) and _  multi - mirror mission _ (; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these surveys are a primary source of information about accreting supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) , i.e. , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , in the universe , providing insights about their demographics , physical properties , and interactions with their environments ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . furthermore ,  surveys are an essential tool for the study of clusters and groups ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) as well as  binary populations in starburst and normal galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; and references therein ) .  surveys with a wide variety of sensitivities and solid angles are required to gain a comprehensive understanding of  source populations in the universe ( e.g. , see section 2.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "such surveys range from shallow , all - sky surveys , the lowest tier of the  surveys `` wedding cake '' , to the highest tier of ultradeep , pencil - beam surveys .",
    "ultradeep  surveys are particularly important as cosmic `` time machines '' , since fainter  sources of a given type generally lie at higher redshifts and thus earlier cosmic epochs .",
    "furthermore , at a given redshift , such ultradeep surveys are capable of probing objects with lower observable  luminosities that are generally more typical members of source populations",
    ". additionally , some intrinsically luminous  sources may have low observable  luminosities owing to strong obscuration ( e.g. , compton - thick agns ) , and ultradeep surveys are one of the key ways of identifying and characterizing such important sources ( e.g. , see section 3.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "the deepest  surveys to date have been conducted in the _ chandra_deep field - south ( ) , which is arguably the most intensively studied multiwavelength region across the entire sky .",
    "currently , published  catalogs exist for the 4  ms _ chandra_exposure ( covering 465  arcmin@xmath1 ; e.g. , @xcite ) and the 3  ms  exposure ( covering 830  arcmin@xmath1 ; e.g. , @xcite ) . in 2013",
    ", we proposed to extend the 4  ms  observations to a total _",
    "chandra _",
    "exposure of 7  ms , and the new observations were conducted during .",
    "the very small _ chandra _  point spread function ( psf ) and low background still allow for significant gains in sensitivity near the field center , and thus the detection of many new sources , even for such long exposures .",
    "furthermore , all previously detected  sources benefit greatly from the improved photon statistics , which allow better measurements of  positions , photometric properties , spectral properties , and variability ; variability studies also benefit from the significantly lengthened time baseline of sensitive  observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these better x - ray measurements advance significantly the physical understanding of the sources producing most of cosmic accretion power ; e.g. , a typical agn in the  will have @xmath14 times more counts than the same agn in the cosmos legacy survey ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will present  point - source catalogs derived from the 7  ms _ chandra _  exposure for use by the community in advancing  deep - survey science projects ; previous _ chandra _  deep fields catalogs of this type have been widely utilized ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we will also present multiwavelength identifications , basic multiwavelength photometry , and spectroscopic / photometric redshifts for the detected  sources .",
    "_ chandra _  source - cataloging methodology has advanced greatly over the years since the _ chandra _  launch , providing substantially improved yields of demonstrably reliable sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) and improved source characterization . here",
    "we will utilize acis extract ( ae ; @xcite ) as a central part of our point - source cataloging .",
    "ae is used as part of an effective two - stage source - detection approach , and it allows for the optimal combination of multiple observations with different aim points and roll angles .",
    "some key agn science projects that should be advanced by the 7  ms  include investigations of ( 1 ) how smbhs , including those in obscured systems , grow and co - evolve with galaxies through the critical era at when massive galaxies were largely assembling , and ( 2 ) how smbhs grow within the first galaxies at @xmath15 .",
    "starburst and normal galaxies are also detected in abundance at the faintest  fluxes ; their differential number counts are comparable to those of agns at the faintest fluxes reached by the 4  ms  ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the 7  ms will thus be a key resource for examining how the  binary populations of starburst and normal galaxies evolve over most of cosmic time , both via studies of the directly detected sources and via stacking analyses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "owing to its unique combination of great depth and high angular resolution , the 7  ms  should serve as a multi - decade _ chandra _  legacy .",
    "for example , even _ athena _ , a  observatory aiming for launch in @xmath16 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , may not be able to reach the flux levels probed in the central region of the 7  ms .",
    "missions capable of substantially surpassing the sensitivity of the 7  ms , such as the _  surveyor _ ( e.g. , @xcite ) , are presently not funded for construction .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following . in section  2",
    "we present the new _ chandra _  observations and the reduction details for the full data set .",
    "section  3 describes the creation of observation images , exposure maps , and the main and supplementary source catalogs . in section  4",
    ", we present the main _ chandra _  source catalog in detail . here",
    "we also present key aspects of the  source characterization and the multiwavelength identifications .",
    "we briefly compare the properties of the newly detected sources to those already found in the 4  ms .",
    "section  5 presents the supplementary catalog of  sources that have lower detection significances but align spatially with bright near - infrared ( nir ) sources . in section  6",
    "we present an analysis of source completeness and reliability , showing that we strike a reasonable balance between these two criteria .",
    "section  7 describes an analysis of the background and sensitivity across the . in section  8",
    "we present cumulative number counts for the main _ chandra _  source catalog , and in section  9 we provide a summary of the main results .",
    "the _ chandra _  source catalogs and several associated data products are being made publicly available along with this paper .",
    "we adopt a galactic column density of @xmath17  @xmath8 along the line of sight to the  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "coordinates are presented in the j2000.0 system , and magnitudes are in the ab system @xcite .",
    "we quote uncertainties at a 1@xmath18 confidence level and upper / lower limits at a 90% confidence level .",
    "a cosmology with @xmath19  km  s@xmath9  mpc@xmath9 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ( @xcite ) is used .",
    "the 7 ms  contains observations taken in four separate epochs of time .",
    "the basic information on these observations , 102 in total , is listed in table  [ tbl - obs ] .",
    "there were 48 recent observations acquired between 2014 june 9 and 2016 march 24 , which constitute the last 3  ms of exposure of the 7  ms .",
    "the first 1  ms of exposure consists of 11 observations taken between 1999 and 2000 @xcite , the next 1  ms of exposure consists of 12 observations taken in 2007 @xcite , and another 2  ms of exposure includes 31 observations in 2010 @xcite .",
    "all 102  observations used the _ chandra _",
    "advanced ccd imaging spectrometer imaging array ( acis - i ; @xcite ) , which is optimized for _ chandra _  surveys .",
    "consists of four ccds ( i0-i3 ) with @xmath22 pixels each ; the size of the ccd pixels is @xmath23 , and the acis - i array size or the field of view of each observation is @xmath24  arcmin@xmath1 . of the 11 observations in the first 1  ms of  exposure , ten ( except observation 1431 - 0 ) were taken in faint mode , while the first observation ( 1431 - 0 ) and all the observations in the later 6 ms of  exposure were taken in very faint mode ( see table  [ tbl - obs ] ) , which reduces particle background significantly and improves detection of weak sources @xcite . during the first two observations ( 1431 - 0 and 1431 - 1 ) , the nominal focal - plane temperature was @xmath25c , while it was @xmath26c for the other observations .",
    "the roll angles of the 102 observations ( table  [ tbl - obs ] ) were intentionally allowed to vary , in order to obtain more uniform sensitivity across the field by averaging out some of the effects ( e.g. , see figure  [ fig - rawimg ] below ) and to obtain a larger areal coverage . the total area covered by the 7  ms is 484.2 arcmin@xmath27 , substantially larger than the field of view of acis - i .",
    "the aim points of individual observations also differ slightly ( table  [ tbl - obs ] ) ; the average aim point for the merged observations , weighted by the individual exposure times , is @xmath28 , @xmath29 .      the data for the 102 observations downloaded from the _ chandra _  x - ray center ( cxc ) have gone through the cxc pipeline software for basic processing .",
    "the software versions are listed in table  [ tbl - obs ] , and the data for the previous 4  ms  observations have been processed with newer versions of the software compared to those presented in the previous catalog papers @xcite .",
    "these data were then reduced and analyzed utilizing _",
    "chandra _  interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ; v4.8 ) tools , ae ( version 2016may25 ) , the marx ray - tracing simulator ( v5.3 ) that is used in ae to model the _",
    "chandra _",
    "acis - i psf , and custom software .",
    "most of the procedures are similar to those performed in @xcite and @xcite , and the main steps are described below .",
    "we adopted the ciao tool acis_process_events to reprocess level 1 event files , applying charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) corrections for observations with nominal focal - plane temperatures of @xmath26c @xcite , flagging potential cosmic - ray background events for very faint mode data ( check_vf_pha = yes ) , and implementing a custom stripped - down bad - pixel file instead of the standard cxc one .",
    "a large fraction of the bad - pixel locations in the standard bad - pixel file appear to contain good @xmath30  kev events that are appropriate for source searching and characterization ; instead of rejecting all events falling on these pixels , we chose to exclude manually those events below a row - dependent energy of 0.50.7 kev that fall on `` hot '' soft columns ( see section 2.2 of @xcite for details ) .",
    "this approach allows us to recover a significant number of additional good events ( @xmath31 of the total ) compared to the standard level 2 data products from the cxc pipeline .",
    "we employed the ciao tool acis_detect_afterglow to identify and flag cosmic - ray afterglow events .",
    "following the procedure of @xcite and @xcite , we further employed custom software and removed 113 additional faint afterglow events with three or more total counts falling on the same ccd pixel within 20  s ( see footnote 27 of @xcite for details about this choice ) .",
    "we inspected the background light curve of each observation utilizing the event browser tool in the tools for acis review & analysis ( tara ; @xcite ) , and we removed background flares using the ciao tool deflare with an iterative 3@xmath18 clipping approach .",
    "the 7  ms  observations are not significantly affected by background flares .",
    "only four observations ( 1431 - 0 , 16176 , 16184 , 17542 ) were affected by flares longer than 10% of their durations ( up to @xmath32 ) , while the other observations have milder or no background flares .",
    "the cleaned exposure time for each observation is listed in table  [ tbl - obs ] . in total ,",
    "1.2% of the exposure was removed due to background flares ; the total cleaned exposure is 6.727  ms .    after generating a cleaned event file for each of the 102 observations ,",
    "the next steps were to register and align these observations to a common astrometric frame and merge them into a combined master event file .",
    "the first action was fixing any astrometric offsets of individual observations .",
    "for each observation , we created a 0.57.0 kev image using the standard _",
    "asca_grade set ( grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) .",
    "we then searched for x - ray sources in the image using wavdetect @xcite with a `` @xmath33  sequence '' of wavelet scales ( i.e. ,  1 , 1.414 , 2 , 2.828 , 4 , 5.656 , and 8 pixels ) and a false - positive probability threshold of 10@xmath34 .",
    "a psf - size image was supplied to the wavdetect run that was created with the ciao tool mkpsfmap assuming a power - law spectrum with a photon index of @xmath35 and an enclosed counts fraction ( ecf ) of 0.4 .",
    "depending on the exposure times of the observations , x - ray sources are detected in the individual data sets .",
    "the initial  positions of these wavdetect sources were refined using ae , and the centroid positions determined by ae from its `` check_positions '' stage were adopted as the improved positions of these sources .",
    "we registered the absolute astrometry of each observation to a common frame by matching the x - ray source positions to the nir source positions in the taiwan ecdfs near - infrared survey ( tenis ) @xmath36-band catalog @xcite , where 6651 bright ( @xmath37 ) tenis sources within the field of view of the 7  ms  were used .",
    "this nir catalog was chosen as its astrometric frame is consistent with those of other optical / nir catalogs ( e.g. , see the list in section  [ sec - id ] below ) offsets in right ascension and declination between this frame and those of the optical / nir catalogs , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , the x - ray source positions in the current 7  ms  catalogs have the same systematic offsets from the 4  ms source positions inherited from the different choices of the astrometric systems .",
    "we caution that the tenis astrometric frame is off from that of the first gaia data release @xcite by @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the @xcite very large array astrometric frame thus agrees better with the gaia frame , although there are not a sufficient number of sources in common for a direct comparison .",
    "[ foot - astrometry ] ] and the fractions of x - ray sources with a bright nir counterpart are high ( ranging from @xmath4280% ) in the  observations .",
    "the matching of the x - ray and tenis sources as well as the world coordinate system ( wcs ) update were performed using the ciao tool reproject_aspect with a 3@xmath43 matching radius and a 06 residual limit ; matches are found in the individual observations , and the positional offsets were used to obtain the wcs transformation for each observation .",
    "the wcs transformation matrices range from 0007 to 1011 in linear translation , @xmath44 to 0014 in rotation , and 0.9996 to 1.0012 in scaling ; the resulting registrations are accurate to @xmath4503 . although the astrometric offsets are small , registering the observations and correcting for the offsets is a necessary step for detecting very faint x - ray sources and obtaining the best - possible  source positions as well as reliable photometric properties .",
    "the astrometry registered event files were produced with the ciao tool reproject_events .",
    "we then projected the event files to the astrometric frame of observation 2406 using reproject_aspect and reproject_events .",
    "finally , we merged these 102 event files into a master event file using the ciao tool dmmerge .",
    "we note that x - ray source detection was performed in the merged observation while source characterization was carried out mainly using the individual astrometry registered observations ( e.g. , the ae photometric extraction ) .",
    "we created  images from the merged event file using the standard _",
    "asca_grade set in three bands : ( full band ; fb ) , ( soft band ; sb ) , and ( hard band ; hb ) . the full - band raw image is shown in figure  [ fig - rawimg ] ; also illustrated are the fields of view of some of the deepest optical",
    " nir surveys from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) within the , including the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the great observatories origins survey southern field ( goods - s ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the combined field of the cosmic assembly deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels ; @xcite ) and the 3d - hst survey @xcite .",
    "3d - hst fields , goods - s survey , and hudf , respectively .",
    "the central black plus sign marks the average aim point .",
    "the apparent lightening of the area surrounding the black plus sign is caused by the relatively low effective exposure in this region due to the acis - i ccd gaps ( see figure  [ fig - expimg ] ) .",
    "the apparent scarcity of sources near the field center is largely due to the small psf size at that location , which makes sources difficult to identify visually in this figure ( see figures  [ fig - clrimg ] and [ fig - srcdist ] for clarification ) . ]    due to the effects of vignetting , gaps between the ccds , bad - pixel filtering , bad - column filtering , spatially dependent degradation in quantum efficiency due to contamination on the acis optical - blocking filters , and slightly different aim points between observations , the effective exposure time of the combined observation can not reach the total cleaned exposure of 6.727  ms , and it varies across the  field . therefore , we constructed effective - exposure maps in the three bands following the basic approach described in section 3.2 of @xcite , taking into account the above effects .",
    "a power - law spectrum with a photon index of @xmath35 was assumed when creating the exposure maps , which is approximately the slope of the cosmic  background spectrum in the full band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the full - band map is shown in figure  [ fig - expimg ] , with a maximum effective exposure time of 6.651  ms .    from the effective - exposure maps",
    ", we can derive the survey solid angle as a function of the minimum effective exposure .",
    "for the purpose of comparing to the previous 2  ms and 4  ms  results ( the definition of the full band and hard band have changed ) , we show in figure  [ fig - soildangle ] such a relation in the soft band .",
    "approximately 49% of the 7 ms  field has effective exposure , while @xmath46  ms is close to the deepest effective exposure achieved in the 4 ms  with only 3% of the field having longer exposure times . in the 7  ms , @xmath47 , 39% , and 9.4% of the field",
    "have @xmath48  ms , @xmath49  ms , and @xmath50  ms effective exposure , respectively .",
    "the survey solid - angle curves for the 4 ms cdf - s @xcite and 2  ms cdf - s @xcite are similar to the 7  ms curve in the sense that they are approximately the scaled - down versions of the 7  ms curve with scaling factors of 1.8 and 3.5 in effective exposure , respectively .",
    "the overall larger solid angles of the 7  ms  compared to the 4  ms  suggest that we are not only able to detect new sources below the 4  ms  sensitivity limit , but also detect new sources above that limit owing to the significantly increased solid angle coverage at any given exposure time .    .",
    "]     ( 49% ) of the 7  ms cdf - s and 13.0  arcmin@xmath1 ( 3% ) of the 4  ms   have @xmath51  ms effective exposure . for comparison ,",
    "the dashed and dash - dotted curves display the 4  ms cdf - s @xcite and 2  ms cdf - s @xcite solid angles , which were derived following the same procedures as in this paper .",
    "the 7  ms curve can be roughly rescaled to 4  ms and 2  ms curves with scaling factors of 1.8 and 3.5 in effective exposure ( gray solid curves ) , respectively . ]",
    "we created exposure - corrected smoothed images in the 0.52.0  kev , 24  kev , and 47  kev bands following section 3.3 of @xcite using the ciao tool csmooth .",
    "the images and effective - exposure maps were adaptively smoothed with the same scale map in each band , and the smoothed images were divided by the corresponding smoothed exposure maps .",
    "these exposure - corrected smoothed images were combined to produce a color composite , as shown in figure  [ fig - clrimg ] ; an expanded view of the central @xmath52 region is also shown to illustrate the large abundance of sources near the field center .",
    "although many of the x - ray sources are clearly visible in the adaptively smoothed images , our source searching was performed on the raw images ( e.g. , figure  [ fig - rawimg ] ) , as detailed in section  [ sec - detection ] below .",
    "our csmooth processes were not optimized to enhance the visibility of extended sources ( which requires external background files for proper computation of the source significance ) , and extended faint color halos which appear in figure  [ fig - clrimg]b are usually artifacts rather than real extended sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "x - ray source detection for the 7  ms  follows the same two - stage approach as was employed in the @xcite 4  ms  catalog , which maximizes the number of reliable sources detected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a candidate source list was initially generated by wavdetect source detection , and it was then filtered by ae to produce our main source catalog , which includes significant  sources that are unlikely to be false detections caused by background fluctuations .",
    "a supplementary source catalog was also produced that contains  sources with bright ( @xmath2 ) nir counterparts .",
    "to generate the candidate source list , we ran wavdetect on the combined raw images in the full band , soft band , and hard band , using a `` @xmath33  sequence '' of wavelet scales ( i.e. ,  1 , 1.414 , 2 , 2.828 , 4 , 5.656 , 8 , 11.314 , and 16 pixels ) and a probability threshold of 10@xmath53 .",
    "the wavdetect process made use of a merged psf map , created by choosing the minimum psf size at each pixel location among all the psf maps of individual observations ( e.g. , see section 2.2.2 of @xcite ) ; such a process is optimized for detection .",
    "we merged the three source lists for the three bands into the candidate source list by cross matching them with a matching radius of @xmath54 for sources within @xmath55 of the average aim point and @xmath56 for sources at larger angles ( the distance between the source position and the average aim point ) ; we also visually inspected all the sources beyond @xmath57 of the average aim point and removed nine candidate sources which are likely the same as their companion detections away .",
    "the x - ray source positions in the merged source list were adopted from , in order of priority , the , , and hard - band positions .",
    "the resulting candidate source list includes 1121 sources .",
    "the relatively loose wavdetect source - detection threshold of 10@xmath53 introduces a non - negligible number of spurious detections .",
    "we also performed wavdetect source searching with the more stringent false - positive probability thresholds of 10@xmath34 , 10@xmath58 , and 10@xmath59 .",
    "we then assigned a minimum wavdetect false - positive probability to each of the 1121 candidate sources according to the minimum wavdetect threshold value at which the source was detected .",
    "of the 1121 sources , 644 , 58 , 102 , and 317 have minimum wavdetect probabilities of 10@xmath59 , 10@xmath58 , 10@xmath34 , and 10@xmath53 , respectively .",
    "candidate sources with smaller minimum wavdetect false - positive probabilities are more likely real detections and most of the spurious detections will have minimum false - positive probabilities of 10@xmath53 ( e.g. , see figure  [ fig - pbvssig ] below ) .    before filtering the candidate source list with ae",
    ", we improved the source positions through the ae `` check_positions '' procedure . as was done in our previous , extended _ chandra _  deep field - south ( ) , and _",
    "chandra _  deep field - north ( ) catalogs @xcite , we adopted ae centroid positions for sources within @xmath57 of the average aim point and matched - filter positions for sources located at larger off - axis angles .",
    "we further visually inspected the raw and adaptively smoothed images for each source and manually chose centroid or matched - filter positions for @xmath60 sources which align better with the apparent source centers ( mostly sources located within 6@xmath57 of the average aim point where the matched - filter positions are preferred ) .",
    "we then utilized ae to extract photometric properties of the candidate sources .",
    "the details of the ae photometric extraction are described in the ae user s guide ; a short summary is presented in section 3.2 of @xcite . briefly , ae performed source and background extractions for each source in each observation and then merged the results .",
    "a polygonal extraction region that approximates the @xmath61 ecf contour of the local psf was utilized to extract source counts ; smaller extraction regions ( @xmath6275% ecfs ) were used in crowded areas where sources have overlapping @xmath61 ecf apertures .",
    "the ae `` better_backgrounds '' algorithm was adopted for background extraction ( section 7.6.1 of the ae user s guide ) , which seeks to obtain a single background region plus a background scaling that simultaneously models all background components , including the background that arises from the psf wings of neighboring sources .",
    "a minimum number of 100 counts in the merged background spectrum is required to ensure photometric accuracy , which was achieved through the ae `` adjust_backscal '' stage .",
    "the extraction results from individual observations were then merged to produce photometry for each source through the ae `` merge_observations '' procedure .",
    "one important output parameter from ae is the binomial no - source probability , @xmath63 , which is the probability of still observing the same number of source counts or more under the assumption that there is no real source at the relevant location and the observed excess number of counts over background is purely due to background fluctuations .",
    "the formula to obtain @xmath63 is given by : @xmath64 in this equation , @xmath65 is the total number of counts in the region and @xmath66 is the total number of counts in the background - extraction region ; @xmath67 is the sum of @xmath65 and @xmath66 ; @xmath68 , with @xmath69 being the area ratio of the background and source - extraction regions .",
    "a smaller @xmath63 value indicates that a source has a larger probability of being real . for each source ,",
    "ae computed a @xmath63 value in each of the three bands , and we adopted the minimum of the three as the final @xmath63 value for the source .",
    "although @xmath63 is a classic confidence level , it is usually not a good indicator of the fraction of spurious sources ( e.g. , a cut at @xmath70 does not correspond to a 1% spurious rate ) , mainly because the extractions were performed on a biased sample of candidate sources that already survived a filtering process by wavdetect .",
    "furthermore , given its definition , the value of @xmath63 also depends on the choices of source and background extraction regions .",
    "therefore , we can not reject spurious sources simply based on the absolute value of @xmath63 itself .",
    "fortunately , from past experience ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we found that the superb multiwavelength coverage in the  allows us to identify counterparts for the majority ( @xmath71 ) of the x - ray sources , and the accurate x - ray and optical / nir / radio source positions also ensure high - confidence associations ( false match rate @xmath72 ) .",
    "these combined factors indicate that x - ray sources having a multiwavelength counterpart ( down to the magnitude limits of the multiwavelength catalogs ) are extremely likely to be real detections .",
    "thus we proceeded to choose a @xmath63 threshold that retains a large number of sources with multiwavelength counterparts while removing most of the sources without counterparts .",
    "the multiwavelength catalogs used for identification and the identification procedure are the same as those described in section [ sec - id ] below .",
    "after evaluation of the matching results at several possible @xmath63 threshold values ( 0.0010.01 ) , we adopted @xmath73 as the criterion to prune the candidate source list and generate a main source catalog , which includes 1008 sources with a @xmath74 multiwavelength - identification rate .",
    "the detailed properties of the main - catalog sources are presented in section 4 below .",
    "the choice of the @xmath63 threshold is an empirical decision , optimized to balance the needs of recovering a large number of real sources ( high completeness ) while keeping the fraction of potential spurious sources small ( high reliability )",
    ". a slightly different choice of the threshold value will affect the final source catalog as well as the catalog completeness and reliability slightly ; in fact , most of the main - catalog sources , 922 out of the 1008 ( 91.5% ) , have @xmath75 and are highly reliable ( @xmath76 identification rate ) .",
    "the @xmath63 threshold value was 0.004 for the 2  ms cdf - n @xcite and 4  ms  @xcite , and it was 0.002 for the 250  ks @xcite . as reasoned above , the absolute @xmath63 values are not directly comparable , but these choices were also made based on the multiwavelength identification results to optimize the balance between completeness and reliability , consistent with our current approach .",

    "we subsequently utilized ae to compute photometric properties and @xmath63 values for these candidate - list sources .    by comparing the input sources and detected sources from the simulation , we can assess the completeness and reliability of our main catalog .",
    "for a given source - count limit , the completeness is defined as the fraction of the input sources detected above the count limit ( the source recovery fraction ) , while the reliability is defined as 1 minus the ratio between the number of spurious sources ( not in the input source list ) above the count limit and the number of input sources above the count limit . as we further filtered the candidate sources with a @xmath63 threshold cut during the second stage of our approach ,",

    "* ) ; we do not attempt to separate these components for our analysis here .",
    "the mean numbers of background counts per pixel are small ( 0.170.60 ) , indicating that many of the  pixels did not receive any x - ray photons over the 7  ms exposure .",
    "indeed , in the full - band , soft - band , and hard - band raw images , @xmath236 , 84% , and 68% of the pixels have zero counts .",

    "the 7  ms  observations span a broad range in time and not all the background components are affected by the decline of the acis effective area .",

    "the ratio between the total numbers of background and source counts in the soft band is approximately the same ( @xmath238 ) for the 2  ms , 4  ms , and 7  ms . in the full and hard bands , the mean background count rates are smaller ( @xmath239 ) than those for the 2  ms and 4  ms , mainly because we adopted a smaller upper energy bound of 7  kev ( instead of 8  kev ) here .",
    "the ratio between the total numbers of background and source counts in the hard band ( @xmath240 ; 27 kev ) is significantly lower than those ( @xmath241 ; 28 kev ) for the 2  ms and 4  ms , confirming that it is advantageous to search for sources in the 27  kev band instead of the 28  kev band where the background has a larger contribution .",

    "the sensitivity drops with increasing off - axis angle .",
    "the full - band sensitivity map is displayed in figure  [ fig - fbsen ] ; flux limits in different ranges are shaded with different gray - scale levels .",
    "it is possible to detect sources with fluxes somewhat smaller than the sensitivity limits at their locations , due to the difference between the @xmath150 values of the sources and the assumed value of 1.4 when computing the flux limits .",
    "there are 11 soft - band , 28 , and 2 sources with fluxes @xmath25313% below their corresponding flux limits .",
    "given the spatial dependence of the sensitivity , we display in figure  [ fig - senhist ] the survey solid angle versus flux limit in the full , soft , and hard bands .",

    "we also compared the 7  ms   sensitivity  area curve to the one for the 4  ms  @xcite in figure  [ fig - senhist ] .",
    "the 4  ms  curve can be approximately scaled to the 7  ms one by dividing the flux limits by a scaling factor of @xmath256 , indicating that the 7  ms   sensitivity has been improved by a factor of @xmath256 on average .",
    "such an improvement in sensitivity is expected given the factor of @xmath257 increase in exposure ( see section  7.3 of @xcite ) and the decrease of the acis - i soft - band effective area over the past years ( see footnote  [ footnote - area ] ) .",
    "we computed the cumulative number of sources , , brighter than a given intrinsic flux , @xmath65 , for the soft and hard bands following the procedure described in section  2 of @xcite .",
