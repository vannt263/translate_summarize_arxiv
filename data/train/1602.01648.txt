    "constructing lattices based on codes is an active topic of study since its first comprehensive introduction by conway and sloane @xcite .",
    "however , not all of the proposed constructions provide a lattice and this is the case of construction c ( or multi - level construction by a code - formula @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the first immediate relation of construction c with a lattice construction happens when we consider a single level ( @xmath1 ) , and then we obtain simply the known construction @xmath4 @xcite . a recent work of kositwattanarerk and oggier @xcite have also explored the relation between construction c and ( lattice ) construction d. they showed that if we consider a family of nested linear binary codes @xmath5 where these nested codes are closed under schur product , then both constructions coincide and we obtain a lattice from contruction c. a well - known example of a lattice construction originating from construction c ( which coincides with construction d ) , that uses as underlying codes the family of reed - muller codes , is the barnes - wall lattice @xcite , @xcite .",
    "besides that , there exist significant properties and applications of construction c that can be useful for engineering purposes , such as the fact that construction c with multi - stage decoding can achieve the high snr capacity of an awgn channel asymptotically as the dimension @xmath6 goes to infinity @xcite . moreover ,",
    "if the underlying codes of this construction are linear , then all points in this constellation have the same minimum distance @xcite , but not necessarily the same kissing number ( our following example [ cex1 ] shows , for example , that the kissing number of an element of construction c varies between @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "another application of nonlattice construction is presented by agrell and eriksson [ [ agrelleriksoon ] ] , where they proved that the @xmath9 tessellation [ [ conwaysloane ] ] ( which we can visualize as a @xmath10level construction c ) exhibits as a lower normalized second moment ( i.e. a better quantization efficiency ) than any known lattice tessellation in dimensions @xmath11 and @xmath12 note that a tessellation of an @xmath13dimensional space is a partition of @xmath14 into regions , such that any pair of regions can be transformed into each other through a rotation , reflection or translation , so it is generally not a lattice .",
    "motivated by this background , our idea in this paper is to study properties of a general construction c and find out how close to a lattice can this construction be , in case it does not satisfy the condition given by @xcite .",
    "our study demonstrates that a two - level ( @xmath2 ) construction c provides a geometrically uniform constellation [ [ forneyguc ] ] , however for three levels and up ( @xmath3 ) the distance spectrum varies between the points of the constellation and consequently it is not geometrically uniform .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we briefly define and present some known properties of construction c. in section iii we prove that we can obtain a geometrically uniform constellation by a two - level construction c. finally , in section iv we discuss the equi - distance spectrum ( eds ) of a two - level construction c and present examples which demonstrate that for more than two levels this property is not valid .",
    "( _ construction c _ ) consider @xmath0 binary codes @xmath15 not necessarily nested or linear .",
    "then we define an infinite constellation @xmath16 in @xmath14 that is called construction c as : @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes real addition , and @xmath19 denotes the set of integers .    note that if @xmath20 i.e. , if we consider a single level with a linear code , then this construction reduces to lattice construction a.    consider @xmath21 and @xmath22 then",
    ", applying the process defined by construction @xmath23 we have : @xmath24    geometrically , we can see this constellation in figure [ ex1 ] where clearly @xmath16 is not a lattice .",
    "obtained by construction @xmath23,height=226 ]    in general , construction @xmath23 produces a nonlattice constellation .",
    "there is a modification of this construction called construction @xmath25 that always provides a lattice .",
    "this happens when the codes @xmath26 considered in the construction are linear and nested , i.e. , @xmath27 and we combine their basis vectors rather than the full codes @xmath26 as in ( [ eqc ] ) .",
    "( _ construction d _ ) let @xmath28 be a family of nested linear binary codes .",
    "let @xmath29 and let @xmath30 be a basis of @xmath31 such that @xmath32 span @xmath33 the lattice @xmath34 consists of all vectors of the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 @xmath37 and the map @xmath38 is defined by @xmath39 with @xmath40 for @xmath41    ( _ schur product _ ) for @xmath42 and @xmath43 we define @xmath44    denote by @xmath45 the smallest lattice that contains @xmath46 there is a condition that if satisfied can guarantee that the construction c will provide a lattice .",
    "@xcite ( _ relation between constructions c and d _ ) given a family of nested binary linear codes @xmath5 then the following statements are equivalent :    * @xmath16 is a lattice .",
    "* @xmath47 * @xmath28 is closed under schur product .",
    "* @xmath48    from our point of view , the result shows a condition under which construction c provides a lattice constellation and this condition makes constructions c and d coincide .",
    "the @xmath9 tessellation [ [ conwaysloane ] ] could be conceived as a @xmath10 level construction c if we consider @xmath49 as the @xmath50-$ ] repetition code and @xmath51 as the @xmath52-$]even parity check code .",
    "note that for @xmath6 even , this construction represents a lattice , because we would have nested linear codes that are closed under schur product .",
    "otherwise , when @xmath6 is odd , we obtain a nonlattice constellation which coincides with our construction c. in particular , for dimensions @xmath53 and @xmath54 it was proved that @xmath9 has a lower normalized second moment than any known lattice tessellation [ [ agrelleriksoon ] ] .",
    "an important lattice property is geometric uniformity and the first point of this study is to check if the constellation given by @xmath16 satisfies this property .",
    "[ gudef ] ( _ geometrically uniform constellation _ ) a constellation @xmath55 is geometrically uniform if for any two codewords @xmath56 there exists a distance - preserving transformation @xmath57 ( translation , reflection , rotation , permutation ) such that @xmath58 and @xmath59    note that the notion of geometric uniformity can be redefined such that for every point @xmath60 there exists a transformation @xmath57 consisting only of reflection , rotation or permutation such that @xmath61 this definition is equivalent to definition [ gudef ] by replacing @xmath62    every lattice @xmath63 is geometrically uniform , due to the fact that any translation @xmath64 by a lattice point @xmath65 is just @xmath63 and it means that every point of the lattice has the same number of neighbors at each distance and all voronoi regions are congruent . indeed , any lattice translation @xmath66 is geometrically uniform .",
    "[ propgu ] ( geometric uniformity of @xmath10level construction c ) consider @xmath67 where @xmath49 and @xmath51 are linear codes .",
    "then , @xmath16 is geometrically uniform .",

    "let @xmath74 be given by @xmath75 with @xmath76 @xmath77 where @xmath78 following ( [ eqdefgu ] ) , we first need to show that @xmath79 we write @xmath80 and @xmath81 @xmath82    hence , the @xmath83th coordinate of @xmath84 has two possible cases : @xmath85_{i}= \\begin{cases }      \\tilde{c_{1i}}+2(\\tilde{c_{2i}}-c_{2i})+4(\\tilde{z_{i}}-z_{i } ) , & \\text{if } c_{1i}=0 \\\\     ( 1-\\tilde{c_{1i}})- 2(\\tilde{c_{2i}}-c_{2i})-4(\\tilde{z_{i}}-z_{i } ) , & \\text{if } c_{1i}=1 \\end{cases}\\ ] ] for @xmath86    we can rewrite the expression ( [ ext ] ) as @xmath87_{i}= ( \\tilde{c_{1i}}-c_{1i } ) { \\rm mod } \\ 2 \\ + 2[(\\tilde{c_{2i}}-c_{2i } ) { \\rm mod } \\ 2 ] + 4z_{i}',\\ ] ] where @xmath88    this covers all the possibilities which guarantees that @xmath84 is an element of @xmath46 to prove that @xmath89 we still need to show the reverse statement , i.e. , that for each @xmath74 there exists @xmath90 such that @xmath91 however , this fact follows from the above derivation because @xmath84 is an isometry ( as a function of @xmath92 ) .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that for @xmath93 @xmath16 is geometrically uniform .",
    "observe that the choice of the transformation t in equation ( [ eqt ] ) is only with respect to the lower level code @xmath49 due to the fact that if it was the zero code , we relapse into construction a ( inflated by a factor of @xmath94 that always provides a lattice which is geometrically uniform . therefore ,",
    "this property only can be changed by the action of the code @xmath95",
    "geometric uniformity implies , in particular , that all points have the same set of euclidean distances to their neighbors .",
    "( _ distance spectrum _ ) the distance spectrum @xmath96 for @xmath97 is defined as    @xmath98 number of points in the constellation at a euclidean distance @xmath99 from the origin .",
    "we can also define    @xmath100 number of points in the constellation at a euclidean distance @xmath99 from an element @xmath101 in the constellation .",
    "( _ equi - distance spectrum _ ) a constellation @xmath55 is said to have equi - distance spectrum ( eds ) if    @xmath102    for all @xmath103    geometric uniformity implies equi - distance spectrum for @xmath2 levels in construction c. however for @xmath104 the equi - distance spectrum ( and hence the geometric uniformity ) property does not hold .",
    "we will now exhibit a direct proof for this consequent property , starting by a definition of a slightly more restrictive notation of distance :    ( _ coordinate - wise equi - distant vectors _ ) two vectors are said to be coordinate - wise equi - distant if their components are equal up to a possible sign change , i.e. , @xmath105    we shall first show that a @xmath10level construction c satisfies the eds property .",
    "although this fact is clearly implied by theorem [ propgu ] , it will serve to contrast the counter example for three levels and up , which we shall bring next .",
    "[ lemmaequi ] ( _ coordinate - wise equi - distant error vector in @xmath16 _ ) consider @xmath106 where @xmath49 and @xmath51 are linear codes .",
    "then , for any @xmath107 there exists @xmath90 such that the error vectors @xmath108 and @xmath109 are coordinate - wise equi - distant .",
    "we have that @xmath107 so we can write them as : @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112    set an element @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 note that , due to the linearity of the codes , clearly @xmath116 also define @xmath117 where @xmath118 is to be defined later and observe that @xmath119    by the definition of the @xmath120 operation , for each coordinate @xmath121 we have that @xmath122    or equivalently , we have that either @xmath123 or @xmath124 for @xmath125 we want to show that the only degree of freedom that is available , i.e. the value of @xmath126 is enough to correct the possibly wrong signs that may appear when we are comparing the absolute values of @xmath109 with @xmath108 .",
    "hence , we want to define @xmath127 such that the error vectors @xmath108 and @xmath109 are coordinate - wise equi - distant , i.e. , @xmath128    define the following error vectors for @xmath109 @xmath129 and also the error vectors for @xmath108 @xmath130 clearly , @xmath131 for @xmath132    let @xmath133 where @xmath134 we can describe the choice of @xmath135 depending on the value of @xmath136 which can be classified into the following possibilities :    * if either @xmath137 or @xmath138 then @xmath139 * if @xmath140 and @xmath141 then @xmath139 * if @xmath142 and @xmath143 then @xmath144 * if @xmath142 and @xmath145 then @xmath146    proceeding this way for each coordinate we would find the element @xmath147 that makes @xmath148 be the right candidate and then @xmath149 will be the element in @xmath16 which we were looking for .    in view of lemma [ lemmaequi ] , we have two important results that follow from it .",

    "[ cex1 ] consider the following linear codes , with @xmath160 and @xmath161 : @xmath162    the construction c in this case will be given by @xmath163 so , consider elements @xmath164 such that    @xmath165 + @xmath166 + @xmath167    we want to show that there is no @xmath90 such that @xmath168 which means in this one dimensional case : @xmath169    note that @xmath170 and the only two values that @xmath152 can take to satisfy @xmath171 are @xmath172 or @xmath173 however , the numbers that can be obtained by combination of codewords plus multiples of @xmath174 are @xmath175 which do not include @xmath176 and @xmath177    therefore , it is not possible to always find an element @xmath90 such that @xmath178 with @xmath164 and it proves that the result of lemma [ lemmaequi ] is not valid for three levels .    clearly , this counter example can be extended to any number of levels @xmath179    example [ cex1 ] relies on @xmath180 being more sparse than @xmath49 and @xmath51 .",
    "however , efficient multi - level constructions usually exhibit the opposite property .",
    "for example , construction d requires a forward nesting relation @xmath181 .",
    "the next example demonstrates that even when the codes are nested ( specifically , all three codes are equal ) , the result of lemma [ lemmaequi ] does not always hold for a @xmath182level construction c.

    "indeed , consider @xmath186 and @xmath187 and we have that @xmath188 and the same elements can be used to prove that @xmath51 is not closed under schur product .",
    "suppose that we had chosen the following elements in @xmath189    @xmath190 + @xmath191 + @xmath192 +    to check whether this constellation has equi - distance spectrum ( eds ) we shall first try to find an element @xmath90 such that @xmath178 so by definition we need to have @xmath193 for all @xmath194 + by analyzing each particular case :    * @xmath195 + * @xmath196 + * @xmath197    we will start by investigating the first coordinate of @xmath198 to have @xmath199 we need to have exclusively @xmath200 following this process , to have @xmath201 @xmath202 so the only options for @xmath203 and @xmath204 are respectively @xmath205 and @xmath206 observe that we can not obtain with these elements @xmath207 or @xmath208 because @xmath209 @xmath210    if we change the value of @xmath211 to @xmath212 that is the other available option , we would have instead of equation ( [ e1 ] ) : @xmath213 and the possible elements @xmath203 and @xmath204 are in this case , respectively @xmath214 and @xmath206 notice that @xmath215 @xmath216 and there is no integer @xmath217 that make the result @xmath207 or @xmath7 holds .",

    "indeed , the point @xmath224 satisfies @xmath225 , so its euclidean distance from @xmath226 is the same as that of @xmath92 from @xmath227",
    "we have seen that a general construction c has two important properties for @xmath2 levels , which are the geometric uniformity and consequently equi - distant spectrum .",
    "moreover , we also proved that these two properties are exclusive for @xmath1 and @xmath8 levels , the first because it falls into the case of construction @xmath4 that is a lattice construction , and the last is the main result of this work , together with the counter examples which show that the respective two properties are not always valid for @xmath104 levels .",
    "we also observed that the importance of this study is well represented by its application into quantization process , where a @xmath10 level construction c represents a low normalized second moment in @xmath11 and @xmath54 dimensions [ [ agrelleriksoon ] ] .",
    "the recent years saw the blooming of multi - terminal lattice coding theory , e.g. , for side information problems , network coding and interference alignment [ [ nazergastpar ] , [ pradhanramchandran ] , [ zamirshamaierez ] ] . some of the new coding schemes are motivated by the insight provided by the lattice structure , while others really hinge upon the euclidean - space linearity of the lattice . more specifically",
    ", multi - terminal codes usually use a nested pair of codes , where one of the codes should be closed under real addition ( i.e. , a lattice ) while the other code can have a non - linear structure.as multi - level codes are natural candidates for nesting , it would be interesting to explore the potential of a hybrid construction c / d nested coding scheme for efficient multi - terminal coding .",
    "another interesting future work is related with forney s research [ [ forneyguc ] ] , where he considered generalized coset codes in @xmath14 based on nested geometrically uniform codes @xmath228 and found conditions under which the resulting coset code is geometrically uniform .",
    "for the special case @xmath229 and @xmath230 this coset code reduces to a construction a lattice .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to extend the main result of this paper to a @xmath10level generalized coset code based on a chain @xmath231 of three geometrically uniform codes .",
