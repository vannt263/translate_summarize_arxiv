    "spatial broken symmetries in the quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) @xmath0-filled organic charge - transfer solids ( cts ) have been of strong experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite interest .",
    "the broken symmetry states include charge order ( hereafter co , this is usually accompanied by intramolecular distortions ) , intermolecular lattice distortions ( hereafter bond order wave or bow ) , antiferromagnetism ( afm ) and spin - peierls ( sp ) order .",
    "multiple orderings may compete or even coexist simultaneously .",
    "interestingly , these unconventional insulating states in the cts are often proximate to superconductivity @xcite , the mechanism of which has remained perplexing after intensive investigations over several decades .",
    "unconventional behavior at or near @xmath0-filling has also been observed in the quasi - two - dimensional organic cts with higher superconducting critical temperatures @xcite , sodium cobaltate @xcite and oxides of titanium @xcite and vanadium @xcite .    in spite of extensive research on 1d instabilities in the cts , detailed comparisons of theory and experiments",
    "remain difficult .",
    "strong electron - electron ( e - e ) coulomb interactions in these systems make calculations particularly challenging , and with few exceptions @xcite existing theoretical discussions of broken symmetries in the interacting @xmath0-filled band have been limited to the _ ground _ state @xcite .",
    "this leaves a number of important questions unresolved , as we point out below .",
    "quasi-1d cts undergo two distinct phase transitions as the temperature ( hereafter t ) is reduced @xcite .",
    "the 4k@xmath1 transition at higher t involves charge degrees of freedom ( t@xmath2 100 k ) , with the semiconducting state below t@xmath3 exhibiting either a dimerized co or a dimerized bow .",
    "charges alternate as 0.5 + @xmath4 and 0.5 ",
    "@xmath4 on the molecules along the stack in the dimerized co. the site charge occupancy in the dimerized co state is commonly written as @xmath51010@xmath5 ( with ` 1 ' and ` 0 ' denoting charge - rich and charge - poor sites ) , and this state is also referred to as the wigner crystal .",
    "the 4k@xmath1 bow has alternating intermolecular bond strengths , but site charges are uniformly 0.5 .",
    "it is generally accepted that the dimer co ( dimer bow ) is obtained for strong ( weak ) intermolecular coulomb interactions ( the intramolecular coulomb interaction can be large in either case , see section iii ) . at t @xmath6 10",
    " 20 k , there occurs a second transition in the cts , involving spin degrees of freedom , to either an sp or an afm state .",
    "importantly , the sp and the afm states both can be derived from the dimer co or the dimer bow .",
    "coexistence of the sp state with the wigner crystal would require that the sp state has the structure @xmath7 , with singlet `` bonds '' alternating in strength between the charge - rich sites of the wigner crystal .",
    "similarly , coexisting afm and wigner crystal would imply site charge - spin occupancies @xmath8 .",
    "the occurrence of both have been suggested in the literature @xcite .",
    "the sp state can also be obtained from dimerization of the dimer 4k@xmath1 bow , in which case there occurs a spontaneous transition from the uniform charge - density state to a coexisting bond - charge - density wave ( bcdw ) @xcite @xmath9 .",
    "the unit cells here are dimers with site occupancies ` 1 ' and ` 0 ' or ` 0 ' and ` 1 ' , with strong and weak interunit 11 and 0@xmath50 bonds , respectively .",
    "the afm state with the same site occupancies @xmath51100@xmath5 is referred to as the bond - charge - spin density wave ( bcsdw ) @xcite and is denoted as @xmath10 .",
    "the above characterizations of the different states and the related bond , charge and spin patterns are largely based on ground state calculations .",
    "the mechanism of the transition from the 4k@xmath1 state to the 2k@xmath1 state lies outside the scope of such theories .",
    "questions that remain unresolved as a consequence include : ( i ) does the nature of the 4k@xmath1 state ( charge versus bond dimerized ) predetermine the site charge occupancies of the 2k@xmath1 state ?",
    "this is assumed in many of the published works .",
    "( ii ) what determines the nature of the 2k@xmath1 state ( afm versus sp ) ? ( iii ) how does one understand the occurrence of two different afm phases ( hereafter afm1 and afm2 ) straddling a single sp phase in the proposed t vs. p ( where p is pressure ) phase diagram ( see fig .  [ fig - phasediag ] ) @xcite for the cationic @xmath0-filled band quasi-1d cts ?",
    "( iv ) what is the nature of the intermediate t states between the 4k@xmath1 dimerized state and the 2k@xmath1 tetramerized state ? as we point out in the next section , where we present a brief review of the experimental results , answers to these questions are crucial for a deeper understanding of the underlying physics of the @xmath0-filled band cts .    in the present paper",
    "we report the results of our calculations of t - dependent behavior within theoretical models incorporating both e - e and electron - phonon ( e - p ) interactions to answer precisely the above questions . one key result of our work is as follows : in between the strong and weak intermolecular coulomb interaction parameter regimes , there exists a third parameter regime within which the intermolecular coulomb interactions are intermediate , and within which there can occur a novel transition from a wigner crystal co state to a bcdw sp state as the t is lowered .",
    "thus the charge or bond ordering in the 4k@xmath1 phase _ does not _ necessarily decide the same in the 2k@xmath1 state .",
    "for realistic intramolecular coulomb interactions ( hubbard @xmath11 ) , we show that the width of this intermediate parameter regime is comparable to the strong and weak intersite interaction regimes .",
    "we believe that our results are directly applicable to the family of the cationic cts ( tmttf)@xmath12x , where a redistribution of charge upon entering the sp state from the co state has been observed @xcite in x = asf@xmath13 and pf@xmath13 .",
    "a natural explanation of this redistribution emerges within our theory .",
    "the sp state within our theory is unique and has the bcdw charge occupancy , while the two afm regions in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig - phasediag ] have different site occupancies .",
    "our theory therefore provides a simple diagnostic to determine the pattern of co coexisting with low - temperature magnetic states in the @xmath0-filled cts .",
    "in addition to the above theoretical results directly pertaining to the quasi-1d cts , our work gives new insight to excitations from a sp ground state in a non - half - filled band . in the case of the usual sp transition within the @xmath14-filled band , the sp state is bond - dimerized at t = 0 and has uniform bonds at t @xmath15 .",
    "the site charges are uniform at all t. this is in contrast to the @xmath0-filled band , where the sp state at t = 0 is bond and charge - tetramerized and the t @xmath15 state is dimerized as opposed to being uniform .",
    "furthermore , we show that the high t phase here can be either charge- or bond - dimerized , starting from the same low t state .",
    "this clearly requires _ two different kinds of spin excitations _ in the @xmath0-filled band .",
    "we demonstrate that spin excitations from the sp state in the @xmath0-filled band can lead to two different kinds of defects in the background bcdw .    in the next section we present a brief yet detailed summary of relevant experimental results in the quasi-1d cts .",
    "the scope of this summary makes the need for having t - dependent theory clear . following this , in section iii we present our theoretical model along with conjectures based on physical intuitive pictures . in section",
    "iv we substantiate these conjectures with accurate quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) and exact diagonalization ( ed ) numerical calculations .",
    "finally in section v we compare our theoretical results and experiments , and present our conclusions .",
    "examples of both co and bow broken symmetry at t @xmath16 t@xmath3 are found in the @xmath0-filled cts .",
    "the 4k@xmath1 phase in the anionic 1:2 cts is commonly bond - dimerized .",
    "the most well known example is mem(tcnq)@xmath12 , which undergoes a metal - insulator transition accompanied with bond - dimerization at 335 k @xcite .",
    "site charges are uniform in this 4k@xmath1 phase .",
    "the 2k@xmath1 phase in the tcnq - based systems is universally sp and not afm . the sp transition in mem(tcnq)@xmath12 occurs below t@xmath17 = 19 k , and low t neutron diffraction measurements of deuterated samples @xcite have established that the bond tetramerization is accompanied by 2k@xmath1 co @xmath51100@xmath5 .",
    "x - ray @xcite and neutron diffraction @xcite experiments have confirmed a similar low t phase in tea(tcnq)@xmath12 .",
    "we will not discuss these further in the present paper , as they are well described within our previous work @xcite .",
    "we will , however , argue that the sp ground state in ( dme - dcnqi)@xmath12ag @xcite ( as opposed to afm ) indicates @xmath51100@xmath5 co in this .",
    "the cationic ( tmtcf)@xmath12x , c= s and se , exhibit more variety , presumably because the counterions affect packing as well as site energies in the cation stack . differences between systems with centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric anions are also observed .",
    "their overall behavior is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig - phasediag ] , where as is customary pressure p can also imply larger interchain coupling .",
    "we have indicated schematically the possible locations of different materials on the phase diagram .",
    "the most significant aspect of the phase diagram is the occurrence of two distinct antiferromagnetic phases , afm1 and afm2 , straddling a single sp phase .",
    "most tmttf lie near the low p region of the phase diagram and are insulating already at or near room temperature because of charge localization , which is due to the intrinsic dimerization along the cationic stacks @xcite .",
    "co at intermediate temperatures t@xmath18 has been found in dielectric permittivity @xcite , nmr @xcite , and esr @xcite experiments on materials near the low and intermediate p end .",
    "although the pattern of the co has not been determined directly , the observation of ferroelectric behavior below t@xmath18 is consistent with @xmath51010@xmath5 type co in this region @xcite . with further lowering of t ,",
    "most ( tmttf)@xmath12x undergo transitions to the afm1 or sp phase ( with x = br a possible exception , see below ) .",
    "x = sbf@xmath13 at low t lies in the afm1 region @xcite , with a very high t@xmath18 and relatively low neel temperature t@xmath19 = 8 k. as the schematic phase diagram indicates , pressure suppresses both t@xmath18 and t@xmath19 in this region . for p",
    "@xmath20 0.5 gpa , ( tmttf)@xmath12sbf@xmath13 undergoes a transition from the afm1 to the sp phase @xcite , the details of which are not completely understood ; any charge disproportionation in the sp phase is small @xcite .",
    "( tmttf)@xmath12reo@xmath21 also has a relatively high t@xmath18 = 225 k , but the low t phase here , reached following an anion - ordering transition is spin singlet @xcite .",
    "et al . _ have suggested , based on nmr experiments , that the co involves the wigner crystal state , but the low t state is the @xmath51100@xmath5 bcdw @xcite .",
    "further along the p axis lie x = asf@xmath13 and pf@xmath13 , where t@xmath18 are reduced to 100 k and 65 k , respectively @xcite .",
    "the low t phase in both cases is now sp .",
    "neutron scattering experiments on ( tmttf)@xmath12pf@xmath13 have found that the lattice distortion in the sp state is the expected 2k@xmath1 bow distortion , but that the amplitude of the lattice distortion is much smaller @xcite than that found in other organic sp materials such as mem(tcnq)@xmath12 . the exact pattern of the bow has not been determined yet .",
    "experimental evidence exists that some form of co persists in the magnetic phases .",
    "for example , the splitting in vibronic modes below t@xmath18 in ( tmttf)@xmath12pf@xmath13 and ( tmttf)@xmath12asf@xmath13 , a signature of charge disproportionation , persists into the sp phase @xcite , indicating coexistence of co and sp . at the same time",
    ", the high t co is in competition with the sp ground state @xcite , as is inferred from the different effects of pressure on t@xmath18 and t@xmath22 : while pressure reduces t@xmath18 , it",
    "_ increases _ t@xmath22 .",
    "this is in clear contrast to the effect of pressure on t@xmath19 in x = sbf@xmath13 .",
    "similarly , deuteration of the hydrogen atoms of tmttf increases t@xmath18 but decreases @xcite t@xmath22 . that higher t@xmath18 is accompanied by lower t@xmath22 for centrosymmetric x ( t@xmath22=",
    "16.4 k in x = pf@xmath13 and 11.1 k in x = asf@xmath13 ) has also been noted @xcite .",
    "this trend is in obvious agreement with the occurrence of afm instead of sp state under ambient pressure in x = sbf@xmath13 .",
    "most interestingly , nakamura _ et al . _ have very recently observed redistribution of the charges on the tmttf molecules in ( tmttf)@xmath12asf@xmath13 and ( tmttf)@xmath12pf@xmath13 as these systems enter the sp phase from co states @xcite .",
    "charge disproportionation , if any , in the sp phase is much smaller than in the co phase @xcite , which is in apparent agreement with the above observations @xcite in x = reo@xmath21 and sbf@xmath13 .",

    "although purely 1d calculations can not yield a finite temperature phase transition , as in all low dimensional theories @xcite we anticipate that the 3d ordering in the real system is principally determined by the dominant 1d instability .",
    "the above hamiltonian includes the most important terms necessary to describe the family of quasi-1d cts , but ignores nonessential terms that may be necessary for understanding the detailed behavior of individual systems .",
    "such nonessential terms include ( i ) the intrinsic dimerization that characterizes many ( tmttf)@xmath12x , ( ii ) interaction between counterions and the carriers on the quasi-1d cations stacks , ( iii ) interchain coulomb interaction , and ( iv ) interchain hopping .",
    "inclusion of the intrinsic dimerization will make the wigner crystal ground state even less likely @xcite , and this is the reason for excluding it .",
    "we have verified the conclusions of reference from exact diagonalization calculations .",
    "the inclusion of interactions with counterions may enhance the wigner crystal ordering@xcite for some ( tmttf)@xmath12x .",
    "we will discuss this point further below , and argue that it is important in the afm1 region of the phase diagram .",
    "the effects of intrinsic dimerization and counterion interactions can be reproduced by modifying the @xmath37 in our hamiltonian , and thus these are not included explicitly .",
    "rather the @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn - h ] ) should be considered as the effective @xmath31 for the quasi-1d cts .",
    "interchain hopping , at least in the tmttf ( though not in the tmtsf ) , are indeed negligible .",
    "the interchain coulomb interaction can promote the wigner crystal within a rectangular lattice framework , but for the realistic nearly triangular lattice will cause frustration , thereby making the bcdw state of interest here even more likely .",
    "we therefore believe that hamiltonian ( [ eqn - h ] ) captures the essential physics of the quasi-1d cts .    for applications to the quasi-1d cts we will be interested in the parameter regime @xcite @xmath38 ev , @xmath39 .",
    "the exact value of @xmath31 is less known , but since the same cationic molecules of interest as well as other related molecules ( for e.g. , hmttf , hmtsf , etc . )",
    "also form quasi-1d @xmath14-filled band mott - hubbard semiconductors with short - range antiferromagnetic spin correlations @xcite , it must be true that @xmath40 ( since for @xmath41 the 1d @xmath14-filled band is a cdw @xcite ) .",
    "two other known theoretical results now fix the range of @xmath31 that will be of interest .",
    "first , the ground state of the @xmath0-filled band within hamiltonian ( [ eqn - h ] ) in the limit of zero e - p coupling is the wigner crystal @xmath51010@xmath5 only for sufficiently large @xmath42 .",
    "second , @xmath43 , and is larger for finite @xmath11 @xcite . with the known @xmath44 and the above restrictions in place",
    ", it is now easily concluded that ( i ) the wigner crystal is obtained in the cts for a relatively narrow range of realistic parameters , and ( ii ) _ even in such cases the material s @xmath31 is barely larger than @xmath45 _ @xcite .",
    "we now go beyond the above ground state theories of spatial broken symmetries to make the following crucial observation : _ each different spin subspace of hamiltonian ( [ eqn - h ] ) must have its own @xmath46 at which the wigner crystal is formed_. this conclusion of a _ spin - dependent _ @xmath47 follows from the comparison of the ferromagnetic subspace with total spin @xmath48 and the @xmath49 subspace .",
    "the ferromagnetic subspace is equivalent to the @xmath14-filled spinless fermion band , and therefore @xmath50 is independent of @xmath11 and exactly 2@xmath51 .",
    "the increase of @xmath52 with decreasing @xmath11 @xcite is then clearly related to the occurrence of doubly occupied and vacant sites at finite @xmath11 in the @xmath49 subspace .",
    "since the probability of double occupancy ( for fixed @xmath11 and @xmath31 ) decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath53 , we can interpolate between the two extreme cases of @xmath49 and @xmath48 to conclude @xmath54 .",
    "we prove this explicitly from numerical calculations in the next section .",
    "our conjecture regarding spin - dependent @xmath45 in turn implies that there exist three distinct parameter regimes for realistic @xmath11 and @xmath31 : ( i ) @xmath55 , in which case the ground state is the bcdw with 2k@xmath1 co and the high temperature 4k@xmath1 state is a bow @xcite ; ( ii ) @xmath56 , in which case both the 4k@xmath1 and the 2k@xmath1 phases have wigner crystal co ; ( iii ) and the intermediate regime @xmath57 .",
    "parameter regime ( i ) has been discussed in our previous work @xcite .",
    "this is the case where the description of the @xmath0-filled band as an effective @xmath14-filled band is appropriate : the unit cell in the 4k@xmath1 state is a dimer of two sites , and the 2k@xmath1 transition can be described as the usual sp dimerization of the dimer lattice .",
    "we will not discuss this parameter region further .",
    "given the @xmath44 values for the cts , parameter regime ( ii ) can have rather narrow width .",
    "for @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and there is no value of realistic @xmath31 for which the ground state is a wigner crystal . for @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and the widths of parameter regime ( iii ) , @xmath62 and of parameter regime ( ii ) , @xmath63 ,",
    "are comparable .",
    "we will discuss parameter regime ( ii ) only briefly , as the physics of this region has been discussed by other authors @xcite .",
    "we investigated thoroughly the intermediate parameter regime ( iii ) , which has not been studied previously . within the intermediate parameter regime",
    "we expect a novel transition from the bcdw in the 2k@xmath1 state at low t to a @xmath51010@xmath5 co in the 4k@xmath1 phase at high t that has not been discussed in the theoretical literature .",
    "our observation regarding the t - dependent behavior of these cts follows from the more general observation that thermodynamic behavior depends on the free energy and the partition function . for the strong e - e interactions of interest here , thermodynamics of 1d systems at temperatures of interest",
    "is determined almost entirely by spin excitations .",
    "since multiplicities of spin states increase with the total spin s , the partition function is dominated by high ( low ) spin states with large ( small ) multiplicities at high ( low ) temperatures . while at t=0 such a system must be a bcdw for @xmath64 , as the temperature is raised , higher and higher spin states begin to dominate the free energy , until @xmath31 for the material in question exceeds @xmath65 , at which point the charge occupancy reverts to @xmath51010@xmath5 we demonstrate this explicitly in the next section .",
    "a charge redistribution is _ expected _ in such a system at t@xmath17 , as the deviation from the average charge of 0.5 is much smaller in the bcdw than in the wigner crystal @xcite .",
    "the above conjecture leads to yet another novel implication .",
    "the ground state for both weak and intermediate intersite coulomb interaction parameters are the bcdw , even as the 4k@xmath1 phases are different in the two cases : bow in the former and co in the latter .",
    "this necessarily requires the existence of _ two different kinds of spin excitations from the bcdw_. recall that within the standard theory of the sp transition in the @xmath14-filled band @xcite , thermal excitations from the t = 0 ground state generates spin excitations with bond - alternation domain walls ( solitons ) , with the phase of bond alternation in between the solitons being opposite to that outside the solitons . progressive increase in t generates more and more solitons with reversed bond alternation phases , until overlaps between the two phases of bond alternations lead ultimately to the uniform state .",
    "a key difference between the @xmath14-filled and @xmath0-filled sp states is that site charge occupancies in spin excitations in the former continue to be uniform , while they are necessarily nonuniform in the latter case , as we show in the next section .",
    "we demonstrate that defect centers with two distinct charge occupancies ( that we will term as type i and ii ) , depending upon the actual value of @xmath31 , are possible in the @xmath0-filled band .",
    "preponderance of one or another type of defects generates the distinct 4k@xmath1 states .",

    "with increasing temperature and increasing number of spin excitations there occur many such regions with reversed bond alternations , and overlaps between regions with different phases of bond alternations leads ultimately to the uniform state .",
    "the above picture needs to be modified for the dimerized dimer bcdw state in the @xmath0-filled band , in which the single site of the @xmath14-filled band system is replaced by a dimer unit with site populations 1 and 0 ( or 0 and 1 ) , and the stronger interdimer 11 bond ( weaker interdimer 0@xmath50 bond ) corresponds to the strong ( weak ) bond in the standard sp case .",
