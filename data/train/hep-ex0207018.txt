    "the production of dijet events at hera is dominated by processes in which a virtual photon , coupling to the electron , interacts with a parton in the proton . in the region of photon virtuality @xmath1 , hard collisions of the photons",
    "do not necessitate the introduction of the concept of the resolved photon ( as for the real photon ) and the process can in principle be described by the direct photon contribution alone .",
    "the analysis presented here explores the region @xmath2 @xmath3 , where different theoretical approaches can be used to take into account higher order corrections  either next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculations , @xmath4 unordered initial qcd cascades , or additional interactions with resolved photons .",
    "comparisons with nlo predictions are likely to become possible in the future . in more detail ,",
    "the present measurements are compared with the following models :    based on the dglap evolution equations and parton showers .",
    "the effects of transversally ( @xmath5 ) and also longitudinally ( @xmath6 ) polarized resolved photon interactions are studied  @xcite .",
    "the cross section for longitudinal photons vanishes for @xmath7 due to gauge invariance .",
    "on the other hand , the concept of a resolved photon breaks down for @xmath8 .",
    "therefore the most promising region in which to search for the @xmath6 resolved processes is @xmath9 , which is often the case in the present analysis .",
    "the main difference between @xmath6 and @xmath5 induced interactions arises from the @xmath10 dependence of the respective fluxes : @xmath11 \\\\",

    "also the dependence of the point - like   ( i.e. perturbatively calculable ) parts of the photon parton distribution functions ( pdf ) on @xmath14and @xmath3 differs  while the @xmath5 pdf are proportional to @xmath15 , the @xmath6 pdf do not , in the first approximation , depend on either @xmath3 or @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "accompanying the hard process are present for example in bfkl or ccfm evolution .",
    "these evolution schemes can lead to final states in which the partons with the largest @xmath4 may come from the cascade , and not , as in dglap evolution , from the hard subprocess .",
    "such events may have a similar topology to that for the resolved interactions in the dglap approximation .",
    "this possibility is investigated using the cascade  1.0 generator  @xcite based on the ccfm evolution equations .",
    "the measurement was done with 16.3 pb@xmath16 of data collected in 1999 , when the electron - proton center - of - mass energy @xmath17 reached 318  gev .",
    "the analysis was performed in @xmath18-proton center - of - mass system and jets were found using the @xmath4 longitudinally invariant jet algorithm .",
    "the phase space is defined by the photon virtuality : @xmath19 , the electron inelasticity : @xmath20 , the transverse energy of two leading jets : @xmath21 , @xmath22 and the pseudorapidity of the two leading jets : @xmath23 .",
    "the measured data are corrected for detector effects using the bayesian unfolding method .",
    "the largest source of systematic errors arises from the model dependence of the detector correction , and from the main calorimeter calibration uncertainty .",

    "in general , herwig  5.9 and rapgap  2.8  @xcite tend to underestimate the measured cross - section .",
    "the decrease of the resolved contribution at high @xmath24is of kinematic origin , due to the limited phase space at low @xmath25 .",
    "the direct contributions almost describe the data in the highest @xmath14bin , while a clear need for resolved processes is observed for @xmath26 .    in the highest @xmath14range ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28",
    ", the herwig direct contribution almost describes the data in the lowest @xmath24bin , but is significantly below it in the highest @xmath24bin .",
    "this indicates that the relevance of the resolved photon contribution is governed by the ratio @xmath29 , rather than by @xmath14 itself .",
    "standard herwig with direct and @xmath5  resolved contributions underestimates the data .",
    "the description is improved by adding @xmath6  resolved photon interactions , which is done using a slightly modified version of herwig with the longitudinal photon flux according to eq .",
    "( [ rovnice2 ] ) and a recent @xmath6 pdf parameterization  @xcite . as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ h1a ] , the @xmath6  resolved contribution is significant , and brings herwig closer to the measurement .",
    "on the other hand , a simple enhancement of the pdf of the @xmath5 in the resolved contribution could lead to a similar prediction as the introduction of resolved @xmath6 . to distinguish between a non - optimal choice of @xmath5  pdf and the need for resolved @xmath6  ,",
    "the dijet cross - section has also been studied as a function of @xmath14 , @xmath25 and @xmath10 , which is shown in fig .",

    "@xmath6 brings the @xmath10 dependence of herwig much closer to the measurement .    as motivated in section  [ uvod ] , the measured cross - sections",
    "are also compared to a prediction of the cascade mc program based on the ccfm evolution scheme .",
    "this theoretical approach does not involve the concept of virtual photon structure and employs much fewer parameters for tuning than the usual dglap - based mc programs .",
    "cascade describes the data reasonably but not perfectly .",
    "in particular , the @xmath14dependence at low @xmath25is poorly described . as indicated by fig .",
    "[ h1b ] , the @xmath10 dependence of the dijet cross - section is better described by cascade than by herwig without the @xmath6 resolved process , since photon polarization states are correctly treated in cascade for all virtualities ( only direct photon interactions are considered ) .",
    "the importance of @xmath5  resolved photon interactions within the dglap evolution scheme at leading order is clearly demonstrated in the region where @xmath30 , even at rather high @xmath14 .",
    "additional @xmath6  resolved photon contributions further improve the agreement of herwig with the measured data .    exploring the ccfm approach",
    ", the mc program cascade does not reproduce the data perfectly , the main discrepancy is observed in the @xmath14dependence at low @xmath25 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath25dependence in cascade is comparable to the sum of the direct and resolved contributions in dglap - based mc programs , showing that non @xmath4 ordered parton cascades can successfully produce the same observables as resolved virtual photons in the lo dglap evolution scheme .",
