    "cosmological observations over the past 15 years have established that the universe is undergoing a late - time phase of accelerated expansion ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is most naturally explained with the presence of a ` dark energy ' , a fluid with negative pressure filling the entire universe , which is currently indistinguishable from einstein s cosmological constant .",
    "alternatively , however , one may consider reproducing observations by modifying the very nature of the gravitational equations of general relativity ( e.g. ; ) .",
    "geometrical probes such as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) and type 1a supernovae ( sn1a ) constrain the expansion history @xmath3 , which however can be equally well fitted by both scenarios .",
    "this degeneracy between dark energy and a modification of standard gravity can only be lifted by dynamical probes looking at the growth of structure inside the universe , which is directly linked to the underlying theory of gravity ( ) .",
    "the growth of cosmological structure induces galaxy peculiar velocities , i.e. coherent flows of galaxies towards matter overdensities .",
    "when redshifts are used to map galaxy positions , we are sensitive to such peculiar velocities , whose line - of - sight component combines with the cosmological redshift . as a result ,",
    "the reconstructed spatial distribution of objects is distorted in the radial direction , what are referred to as _ redshift - space distortions _ ( rsd ) .",
    "rsd can be quantified statistically in galaxy redshift surveys by modelling the corresponding anisotropy that can be measured in the two - point correlation function ( 2pcf ) @xmath4 or , correspondingly , in the power spectrum @xmath5 . in the linear regime , this effect is described in fourier space by the kaiser model @xcite , or its equivalent in configuration space developed by @xcite .",
    "such modelling is however complicated by the non - linear evolution of matter overdensities and velocities ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "on large scales we can still observe the linear , coherent flows tracing the growth of cosmological structure , which enhance the amplitude of two - point correlations .",
    "but small - scale motions are dominated by high - velocity galaxies in virialized structures , resulting from the dynamical evolution of the highest peaks in the density field .",
    "the resulting stretching effect in galaxy maps is commonly referred to as the _ fingers of god _ effect ( fog ) , due to the elongated shapes that groups and clusters acquire when observed in redshift space .",
    "these two regimes of rsd produce characteristic features in the two - point statistics of the galaxy distribution , which can be studied by computing the correlation function as a function of two variables , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , perpendicular and parallel to the line of sight , respectively .",
    "the two effects , linear and non - linear , introduce respectively a large - scale squashing and a small - scale elongation along the line - of - sight direction @xmath7 . in linear theory , the amplitude of the squashing effect is directly proportional to the logarithmic growth rate of density fluctuations @xmath8 ( see eq . ) @xcite . in practice , our discrete tracers will generally be biased with respect to the overall matter distribution . under the hypothesis of a linear bias @xmath9 , the large - scale squashing effect will depend on the parameter @xmath10 .",
    "an empirical correction to the linear model was introduced as to account for the contribution of nonlinear distortions , what is normally referred to as the _ dispersion model _ @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the linear expression is convolved ( in configuration space ) , or multiplied ( in fourier space ) with a given distribution function for the pairwise velocities @xmath11 along the line of sight .",
    "the dispersion model has been widely and successfully used in the past to estimate @xmath12 from measurements of @xmath13 @xcite or the power spectrum @xcite .",
    "it has become clear that such empirical correction provides estimates that can be biased by up to 10% , typically depending on the bias of the tracer being employed @xcite .",
    "the precision already achieved by current largest surveys requires to improve on these limitations to reach systematic errors of the order of the percent ( e.g. boss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such limitations are intrinsic in the empirical nature of the dispersion model @xcite and significant effort has been invested over the past five years to improve this theoretical description ( e.g. ; ; ; , and references therein , ) .",
    "alternatively , these theoretical limitations may be evaded if we are able to ( a ) identify galaxy tracers that are less affected by non - linearities , and/or ( b ) build novel statistics of galaxy clustering for which model fits are less sensitive to the same effect , while keeping the theoretical model as simple as possible .    in this paper",
    "we investigate two options along these two avenues .",
    "specifically , we consider the case in which one has access to a robust galaxy group catalogue within the volume of a corresponding galaxy redshift survey ; this will be possible with next - generation galaxy redshift surveys such as euclid @xcite , also in combination with observations in other bands , as in particular the x - ray data from e - rosita ( ) . we therefore first consider the merits of using the galaxy group - galaxy cross - correlation to extract the distortion parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we might expect the centre of mass of a galaxy group to have little or no random velocity , since the internal orbital velocities produce fingers - of - god only in the overall galaxy distribution .",
    "in this view , group - group correlations should be ideally placed ( as also suggested by the dependence of the systematic error on the halo mass shown by ) . moreover",
    ", the group - galaxy cross - correlation provides a higher statistical power than using group auto - correlation , given the higher number density of the galaxy catalogue .",
    "secondly , we investigate a new way of compressing the cosmological information present in the anisotropic two - point correlation function in redshift space , by building modified ( truncated ) multipole moments of @xmath13 that partially mitigate small - scale non - linearities . these functions avoid explicitly including the contributions from small transverse scales , dominated by non - linear distortions . in this analysis , we therefore compare the standard approach of using galaxy or group auto - correlation and the novel approach of using the galaxy - group cross - correlation , as well as study how the different estimators of the two - point statistics , namely the anisotropic 2pcf @xmath1 , its standard multipoles @xmath14 and its truncated multipoles @xmath15 , behave in recovering the distortion parameter @xmath0 in simulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",

    "however , if we are willing to work with smaller volumes , the sub - sample method is closer to the ideal case of many realizations .",
    "the sub - samples are not truly independent , and so the results will not be correct on scales approaching that of the sub - volume , but otherwise the sub - sample method should yield directly a reliable covariance matrix for samples having the size of a single sub - volume . if we divide the initial dataset into @xmath138 sub - volumes , we can derive the desired statistic ( anisotropic 2pcf or its multipoles , in this case ) for each sub - volume , so the natural thing to do is to average these sub - estimates ( as opposed to estimating the statistic over the whole sample ) . in the small - scale limit where the sub - samples can be treated as independent , the covariance matrix for this mean statistic",
    "would then be just reduced by a factor @xmath138 , since covariances of independent samples add linearly .",

    "we use a power - law form to extrapolate @xmath162 on scales below @xmath166 .",

    "the fitting results are listed in table [ tab : pow - law ] and shown in figure [ fig : pow - law ] for the cross - correlation ( green line ) and the galaxy auto - correlation(blue line ) and in figure [ fig : pow - law1 ] for the group auto - correlation ( red line ) . in figures [ fig : pow - law ] and [ fig : pow - law1 ] , the error bars related to the statistical errors on the measured correlation functions are smaller than the size of the plot symbols .    .. [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     so far we have used as `` groups '' a catalogue of dark matter haloes with @xmath113 . in this section we test how strong is the dependence of the main results obtained so far , on this mass threshold . to this end , we create the set of group catalogues listed in table [ tab : group_cats ] .",
    "we limit our tests to using the truncated multipole moments of the 2pcf and obviously include the full covariance matrix of the data .",
    "the results for the group auto correlation are plotted in figure [ fig : mps - rp_gr_mass ] .",
    "these show a monotonic trend of the systematic error , almost independently of the minimum fitting scale @xmath174 .",
    "the `` sweet spot '' for which the error is minimised appears to correspond to masses around @xmath175 .",
    "this behaviour agrees with the previous result obtained by @xcite using halo catalogues from the basicc simulation .",
    "a similar trend is seen in the group - galaxy cross correlation ( figure [ fig : mps - rp_gal+cross_mass ] ) , but in this case there is a dependence on the minimum fitting scale and a general tendency to underestimate the value of the distortion parameter for all group catalogues . from this figure",
    ", we see that the group catalogue used for most of the tests in the paper ( i.e. @xmath176  green line ) is fairly representative of the general behaviour of the cross - correlation function when used to estimate @xmath0 .",
    "this work has explored two different ways of improving the accuracy of the measurement of the growth rate of cosmological structure : by using the cross - correlation of individual galaxies with groups of galaxies as well as by using a novel estimator of the two - point statistics in redshift space , the _ truncated multipole moments_. the aim is to reduce the impact of non - linearities arising from small - scale random peculiar pairwise velocities , with respect to the usual approach of using the multipole moments of the galaxy auto - correlation .",
    "we have used a set of simulated catalogues of galaxies to compare the accuracy with which the anisotropic 2pcf @xmath1 , its multipole moments @xmath16 , and its truncated multipole moments @xmath17 , allow the recovery of the rsd parameters @xmath0 . in this comparison",
    "we compared both linear theory and the dispersion model for rsd .",
    "we find that fitting the full anisotropic auto - correlation function of galaxies underestimates the distortion parameter by about @xmath177 , confirming the results of @xcite .",
    "the group - galaxy cross - correlation reduces this bias to a level of about @xmath178 , and the group auto - correlation ( for groups with mass larger than @xmath179 ) provides us with even less biased results , reaching an accuracy of about @xmath180 . as one may have expected , there is almost no difference between using either linear theory or the dispersion model when fitting the group auto - correlation function : the finger of god effect on group centroids is rather minor .",
    "the analysis of standard multipole moments gives no clear indications of the best choice of tracer for rsd . while the galaxy auto - correlation and the group - galaxy cross - correlation lead to similar results , the group auto - correlation produces highly scale - dependent measurements of the distortion parameter .",
    "such complications can mostly be explained by the fact that strong non - linearities on small transverse scales @xmath6 are integrated over all scales when projecting the 2pcf on legendre polynomials , which are not captured by linear or dispersion rsd models .",
    "this does not happen when fitting the full @xmath13 after excluding scales below a given @xmath6 .",
    "this problem is alleviated by the _ truncated multipole moments _ that we have introduced .",
    "these provide the most accurate estimates of the distortion parameter among the present tests , improving the accuracy over the use of @xmath1 and @xmath16 . in that case",
    ", the galaxy auto - correlation underestimates the distortion parameter by about @xmath180 , while the group auto - correlation becomes gradually less biased when using larger minimum scales to reach a few percent accuracy on scales greater than @xmath181 .",
    "the group - galaxy cross - correlation , when similarly fitted with the dispersion model , produces more stable and also more accurate measurements of @xmath0 , reaching the percent level of accuracy when fitting scales greater than @xmath182 .",
    "a comparison with the results from the linear model shows how the truncated multipole moments allow reducing the impact of small - scale non - linearities in rsd measurements , making possible the analysis with the simple linear model .",
    "in fact , for the galaxy auto - correlation , the limit at which the dispersion model breaks down is translated to @xmath182 , compared with @xmath181 in the case of the anisotropic 2pcf .",
    "we studied the impact of bin - to - bin covariances in the fitting procedure and found no significant difference in terms of systematics , confirming our findings based on using only the diagonal covariance matrix .",
    "finally , we have directly tested how our general results may depend on the mass threshold chosen to define the the group catalogue used for most of the tests ( @xmath179 ) .",
    "the exercise using a set of further six group catalogues , with minimum mass thresholds ranging from @xmath183 to @xmath184 , shows that the `` standard '' group catalogue is fairly representative of the general trend observed in the systematic errors when using the cross correlation function .",
    "additionally , it further confirms the dependence of the errors on the halo mass threshold , evidenced in @xcite .",
    "although none of the methods studied here yields a zero bias , we find the results encouraging .",
    "small systematics at the few percent level arise in rsd from other effects to do with the sky sampling @xcite , and these are already corrected for by analysis of mock data .",
    "the same approach could be taken in order to incorporate small systematic errors in the theoretical rsd models being used , although further work will be required in order to demonstrate that these systematic offsets themselves are consistent independent of the true cosmology under study .",
    "the other element of this study that could benefit from extension concerns the group catalogue .",
    "the present work is somewhat idealised in that the group proxies are dark - matter haloes that are found directly in the simulation using more information than would be available in a real galaxy survey .",
    "the next step is therefore to repeat this analysis using a full simulation of the construction of an empirical group catalogue by linking the simulated galaxies in redshift space ( following e.g. ) . at large group masses , uncertainties in group centroids",
    "should not be large , and so the features of the present work in terms of small fingers of god should be reproduced .",
