    "nonhomogeneous media , multilayered structures and functionally graded materials ( fgms ) are of considerable technical and engineering importance as well as of mathematical interest ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "generally , such materials refer to heterogenous composite materials in which the material moduli vary smoothly and continously from point to point .",
    "typical examples of fgms are ceramic / ceramic and metal / ceramic systems .",
    "compressive reviews on aspects of fgms can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , only few investigations have been made to assess the role and the importance of dislocations in fgms .",
    "for the first time , @xcite found the displacement and stress fields of a screw dislocation in an isotropic medium which is arbitrary graded in the @xmath0-direction .",
    "one important example for a fgm are exponentially graded materials . for such media",
    "the elasticity moduli are exponential functions depending on the space coordinates and the new material parameters describing the gradation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the green function for a two dimensional exponentially graded elastic medium has been found by  @xcite and the three - dimensional green function is given by  @xcite .",
    "classical continuum theories possess no intrinsic length scales and , therefore , they are scale - free continuum theories which are not able to describe size effects being of importance at micro- and nanoscales and near defects . in order to describe such effects",
    "generalized continuum theories are needed .",
    "such generalized continuum theories are , for instance , strain gradient theories  @xcite and the dislocation gauge theory  @xcite which enrich the classical theories with additional material lengths . using strain gradient elasticity ,",
    "cracks in fgms have been investigated by  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for the first time ever , the solution of a screw dislocation in fgms , using the theory of gradient elasticity , was given by  @xcite .",
    "gradient elasticity is a theory which is very popular in engineering sciences .",
    "but not everything is well - understood about the physical importance of the higher - order stresses ( hyperstresses ) .",
    "gradient elasticity should be understood as an effective theory since it was invented for compatible deformations . on the other hand , a more physically motivated ` gradient - like '",
    "theory is the so - called dislocation gauge theory . in the dislocation gauge theory both the incompatible elastic distortion tensor and the dislocation density tensor",
    "are physical state quantities giving contribution to the elastic stored energy density .",
    "also for nonhomogeneous media these physical state quantities are gauge - invariant . in this approach ,",
    "the higher - order stress is realized as pseudomoment stress which is the response to the presence of dislocations .",
    "this pseudomoment stress is related to the moment stress known from generalized elasticities like cosserat elasticity  ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the force stress tensor is asymmetric like in cosserat elasticity . in general , in gradient elasticity the hyperstress ( double stress ) possesses five material moduli  @xcite . in a simplified version of gradient",
    "elasticity  @xcite under ad - hoc assumptions the double stress can be simplified . in the dislocation gauge theory",
    "such assumptions are not necessary . for that reason we use the gauge theory of dislocations in this paper .",
    "in this paper we study a screw dislocation in fgm in the framework of the translation gauge theory of dislocations . in section 2",
    "we start with the general framework of the translational gauge theory of dislocations and we derive the isotropic three - dimensional field equations of dislocations for nonhomogeneous media as well as for exponentially graded materials . in section 3",
    "we specialize in the anti - plane problem and we give the gauge - theoretical solution of a screw dislocation in exponentially graded materials .",
    "we find rigorous and ` simple ' analytical solutions for the force stresses , elastic distortion , torsion and pseudomoment stresses produced by a screw dislocation in fgms .",
    "our hope is that the gauge solution will provide new physical insight to possible improvements of designing fgms .",
    "this section introduces the notation and constitutive equations of the translational gauge theory of dislocations  @xcite , which will be used to investigate a screw dislocation in fgms . in the dislocation gauge theory ,",
    "the elastic distortion tensor @xmath2 is incompatible due to the occurrence of a so - called translational gauge field @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the displacement vector .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath5 and @xmath3 are just the canonical field quantities and they are not unique and not physical state quantities . in presence of dislocations , @xmath5 and @xmath3 are discontinuous ( or multivalued ) fields .",
    "the gauge field @xmath3 may be identified with the negative plastic distortion .",
    "the appearance of incompatibility in form of the translation gauge field gives rise to an incompatibility tensor in the framework of the translation gauge theory of dislocations which is called the dislocation density tensor or torsion tensor .",
    "accordingly , the dislocation density tensor is given in terms of the gauge field @xmath6 and , alternatively , in terms of the elastic distortion @xmath7 in the present framework , the elastic distortion tensor @xmath2 and the dislocation density tensor @xmath8 are the physical state quantities .",
    "due to the form of the dislocation density tensor ( [ t1 ] ) and ( [ t2 ] ) it fulfills the translational bianchi identity @xmath9 eq .",
    "( [ bi ] ) is the well - known conservation law of dislocations and states that a dislocation line can not end inside the body .    in the static case of the ( linear ) translation gauge theory of dislocations",

    "the only difference is that the constitutive moduli are not constant .",
