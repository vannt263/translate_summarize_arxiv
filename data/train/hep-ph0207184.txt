    "as is well known , @xmath16-violating models  @xcite provide a way to generate majorana neutrino masses without having to introduce new fields in addition to those present in the minimal supersymmetric standard model . in general ,",

    "this situation is dangerous as it induces a too fast proton decay .",
    "one way to deal with this problem is to assume that @xmath18 is conserved , and that @xmath16 is broken through the violation of @xmath17 only . such a choice is theoretically motivated in the context of unified string theories  @xcite . lately , it has also received quite some attention in studies of collider signatures  @xcite .    among the @xmath16-violating couplings that break only @xmath17 , @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "seem particularly interesting . indeed , in addition to giving among the largest contributions to neutrino masses  @xcite , they lead to the production of charged  @xcite and neutral sleptons  @xcite that may not be distinguished from neutral and charged higgs bosons  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore very important to determine how large a value for such couplings is allowed by existing experimental results .",
    "direct searches of sparticles production and of particle / sparticles decays induced by these couplings do not constrain them very significantly ( see discussion in ref .  @xcite ) .",
    "indirect probes lead to constraints that can , in general , be evaded .",
    "this is because several other parameters are usually involved in their extraction , whose approximate vanishing , instead of that of the couplings @xmath8 and @xmath9 , may be responsible for the lack of any signal .",
    "neutrino physics , in particular , is considered one of the most severe tests for @xmath16-violating couplings .",
    "hard bilinear terms from the superpotential and soft bilinear terms are both compelled to be tiny by the requirement that tree - level contributions to neutrino masses are @xmath19ev @xcite .",
    "similarly , it is believed that for the one - loop contributions not to exceed the @xmath20ev mark , the couplings @xmath8 and @xmath9 must be @xmath21 .",
    "nevertheless , irrespectively of the mechanism chosen to keep the tree - level contributions small , the one - loop contributions can be sufficiently reduced by the requirement that the nearly vanishing parameters are the left - right mixing terms in the sfermion mass matrices , instead than the couplings @xmath8 and @xmath9 . furthermore",
    ", heavy third generation squark masses may help suppressing the one - loop contributions induced by the couplings @xmath9 .",
    "all in all , the possibility of observing charged and neutral sleptons in incoming collider experiments , does not seem to be jeopardized by neutrino physics , at least at the one - loop level  @xcite .",
    "it is in this spirit that studies of such signals have been performed , for relatively large values of the trilinear superpotential couplings @xmath8 and @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "there exist also two - loop contributions to neutrino masses .",
    "they are usually ignored , since loop - suppressed with respect to the one - loop contributions . however , once the one - loop contributions are reduced down to values compatible with experimental observations , it is not possible to neglect them anymore .",
    "the combinations of various parameters entering in the calculation of the two - loop diagrams are different from those encountered in the calculation of the one - loop diagrams .",
    "thus , it is possible that not all two - loop contributions are affected by the one - loop constraints and that some of them are still rather large .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate the two - loop contributions and to establish whether they induce additional constraints on @xmath16-violating couplings , possibly in combination with other supersymmetric parameters .",
    "some of the two - loop contributions , i.e. those proportional to the soft trilinear @xmath16-violating couplings @xmath12 and @xmath13 , were for the first time considered in ref .  @xcite . in the scenarios described there , one - loop contributions are absent , due to symmetries forbidding the lowest - order @xmath16-violating superpotential operators .",

    "to begin with , it is useful to review the results obtained at the one loop .",

    "the @xmath24 diagram yields @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the two sbottom eigenvalues , and @xmath28 is the left - right entry in the @xmath29 sbottom mass squared matrix .",

    ", it reduces to @xmath33 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath34 diagram leads to : @xmath35 where conventions as those for the @xmath24 diagram are adopted .",
    "notice that in both eqs .",
    "( [ m_oneloop - b ] ) and  ( [ m_oneloop - tau ] ) , no intergenerational mixing terms among sfermions are assumed to be present .    as discussed also in ref .",

    "* @xmath37 and @xmath38 are small . typically , to suppress the @xmath24 diagram , values as tiny as @xmath39 are needed . for this estimate",
    "the two sbottom mass eigenvalues were assumed to be of the same order of magnitude , i.e. @xmath40 .",

    "again , for @xmath57 , as well as @xmath58 , we obtain @xmath59 where @xmath60 is @xmath61 notice that , if @xmath45 and @xmath62 , and both products of couplings @xmath55 and @xmath50 are of @xmath51 , an overall scale of the sbottom system 10 times larger than that of the stau system is required .",
    "of course , all three suppression mechanisms , or two of them , may concur to reduce the value of neutrino mass terms , therefore alleviating the severity of constraints obtained when only one mechanism is acting . in the following",
    ", we shall consider option  _ ( 3 ) _ as the least likely among the three possibilities listed above .",
    "thus , we assume that all @xmath16-violating couplings are real , and although not necessary , we also take them to be positive .    one observation that comes out clear from this discussion , and that it is often not appreciated enough , is that the constraints from neutrino masses on the hard superpotential trilinear @xmath16-violating couplings , @xmath55 and @xmath50 , depend strongly on the details of supersymmetry breaking .",

    "nevertheless , it does simplify significantly the following formulas .    in general , due to the presence of bilinear terms in the superpotential and the scalar potential , the cp - even components @xmath76 , in general , mix with the cp - even higgs fields , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and the cp - odd components @xmath79 , mix with the cp - odd higgs field , @xmath63 .",
    "thus , a mass splitting for the cp - even and cp - odd states is , indeed , generated at the tree level .",
    "the two one - loop diagrams with exchange of @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which would cancel each other if such a splitting would not exist , give then a finite contribution to neutrino mass terms .",
    "such one - loop contributions are strictly related to parameters involved also in the generation of tree - level contributions to neutrino masses  @xcite .",
