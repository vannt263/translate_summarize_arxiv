    "current interest in the use of symanzik s improvement scheme , supplemented by mean - field link renormalisation , to provide a better discretisation scheme for qcd has stemmed from recent successes of coarse lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "coarse lattices offer the advantage of a significant reduction in computational overheads , since the approach to the continuum limit is accompanied by a rapid increase in cpu time requirements for monte carlo calculations . the improvement scheme allowed , for example , calculations of the static potential at lattice spacings up to @xmath0 fm with discretisation errors of only @xmath1 .",
    "an attempt to use these actions on coarse lattices to examine the glueball spectrum of qcd proved difficult , however @xcite .",
    "the qcd glueballs are massive states and their evaluation on the lattice is notoriously difficult due to the large vacuum fluctuations of glueball operators . on a lattice with coarse temporal discretisation , the glueball correlator can barely be resolved before it is lost in the noisy vacuum .",
    "the use of a large operator basis set to optimise the ground state overlap was hampered by a technical difficulty caused by the @xmath2 rectangle in the improved action .",
    "this term couples next - to - nearest neighbouring time - slices and thus modifies the transfer matrix , making it non - hermitian ( physically , this term leads to the presence of unwanted extra modes in the improved gluon dispersion relation ) .",
    "a hermitian , positive transfer matrix is required for the validity of the variational calculation employed and to ensure that the effective mass approaches its asymptotic value from above .",
    "these problems naturally suggest breaking the explicit euclidean symmetry of the action and using a different lattice spacing in the spatial and temporal directions . with a shorter temporal lattice spacing , @xmath3 , clear evidence for plateaux in the effective masses",
    "can be seen before the signal is lost .",
    "once discretisations of this form are used , a solution to the transfer matrix problem arises too .    in this article ,",
    "a study of three of the lighter glueball states at six different lattice spacings is discussed .",
    "for all but the scalar glueball , the results show the expected scaling behaviour .",
    "the improvement scheme can be extended readily to anisotropic lattices @xcite . in this study , the following action was used : @xmath4 with @xmath5 the plaquette in the @xmath6 plane , and @xmath7 the @xmath8 @xmath6 plane rectangle ( with longest side parallel to the @xmath9 axis ) .",
    "this action , intended for use with @xmath10 , has @xmath11 discretisation errors .",
    "the coefficients were determined using tree - level perturbation theory and tadpole improvement @xcite .",
    "the spatial mean link , @xmath12 , was tuned such that the input value in the action matched its measured value as defined by @xmath13 .",
    "this tuning is rapidly convergent and requires a minimal amount of work .",
    "the temporal mean link , @xmath14 , was fixed to @xmath15 , since its value in landau gauge differs from unity by @xmath16 .",
    "a set of six simulations were performed at fixed anisotropy , @xmath17 , with the intention of examining the scaling behaviour of the glueball masses using this action .",
    "the run parameters are given in table [ tab : runparams ] .",
    "configurations were generated using the cabibbo - marinari ( cm ) pseudo - heatbath and creutz over - relaxation ( or ) methods . in our previous coarse lattice calculation @xcite , large statistical samples were gathered in an attempt to resolve the glueball correlators . for this work ,",
    "much smaller statistical samples were required and the largest data set collected ( for the coarsest lattice ) consisted of 100 bins , with each bin containing an average of 100 measurements , each measurement separated by 3 sweeps of a 1 - 3 hybrid cm / or update .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the 334 bins of 1000 measurements from the old calculation , which yielded far less information .",
    "the lattice spacing was set by fitting the on - axis static potential to a standard ansatz , @xmath18 then using the fit to determine the hadronic scale , @xmath19 @xcite , defined as @xmath20 at @xmath21 , which corresponds roughly to @xmath22fm .",
    "this definition gives a lattice scale that is less dependent on the choice of potential fit ansatz than the string tension scale .",
    "the results of this determination are given in table [ tab : runparams ] .",
    "in all these calculations , the input ratio @xmath23 has been used since its renormalisation is known to be small @xcite . in all runs , the lattice volumes were chosen to be large enough such that the masses of the scalar and tensor states should lie within @xmath24 of their infinite volume limits as determined by lscher s finite volume analysis @xcite .",
