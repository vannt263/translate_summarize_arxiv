    "furthermore , emission lines such as c  vi , o  vii , and o  viii have been detected in a high spectral resolution observation made with microcalorimeters flown on a sounding rocket , confirming the thermal origin for much of the background @xcite .",
    "however , the x - ray emission carries little distance information , and its interpretation is typically subject to large uncertainties in line - of - sight absorption .",
    "therefore , it is very difficult , if not impossible , to infer the spatial and physical properties of the hot gas from x - ray emission measurements alone .",
    "alternatively , one can study the hism by observing its absorption against bright background x - ray sources .",

    "we have carried out a systematic _ chandra _ archival study of the x - ray absorption lines in the spectra of galactic lmxbs .",
    "because of their brightness and intrinsic spectral simplicity ( relatively free from the complexity which could be caused by the stellar wind of a massive companion ; e.g. , schulz & brandt 2002 ) , lmxbs are excellent background sources for the study of the intervening x - ray - absorbing gas .",
    "we find that existing archival observations are already quite useful , although they were typically not optimized for detecting absorption lines , in terms of both the instrument setup and the exposure time .",
    "in addition to the work by @xcite , there have been a few reported x - ray absorption line studies that are based on the grating observations of lmxbs .",
    "however , these studies are focused on the absorption lines produced either by the cool phase of the ism ( e.g. , paerels et al .  2001 ; juett et al .",

    "in principle , the x - ray - absorbing hot gas could be local to the binary systems . to account for the large column densities estimated above",
    ", a plausible scenario might be the photo - ionized winds from the accretion disks that are presumably responsible for the x - ray continuous emission .",
    "such a scenario , if confirmed , would be interesting in its own right .",

    "but we do not detect any significant ne  x absorption line in any of the spectra .",
    "based on these arguments , even though not conclusive ( there are other possibilities such as a clumpy wind ) , we find that the x - ray line absorption is unlikely to be associated with the lmxbs .",

    "the fit ( @xmath145 ) of the data with this model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sphere_scale ] ) is slightly worse than that with the disk model .",
    "the best - fit parameters are @xmath146 cm@xmath73 , @xmath147 kpc .    with the fitted @xmath123 and @xmath124 , or @xmath134 and @xmath135 , we estimate the total hot gas mass as @xmath148 m@xmath149 and @xmath150 m@xmath149 for the disk and the sphere characterizations within a 15 kpc radius .",
    "this mass estimate is very uncertain as it depends sensitively on the assumed characterization forms and their spatial limits , which can not be constrained by the existing data .",
    "taking the cie radiative cooling function @xmath151 at @xmath152 k @xcite , we obtain the corresponding cooling rates as @xmath153 and @xmath154 , which , within their uncertainties , are comparable to those obtained from observations of nearby disk galaxies of similar sizes ( e.g. , wang et al .  2003 ) .",
    "the cooling probably accounts for only a small fraction of the expected supernova ( sn ) mechanical energy input in the galaxy ( @xmath155 , assuming @xmath156 per sn and one sn per 30 years ) .",
    "a more realistic spatial distribution of the hot gas may be between the above two extreme characterizations .",
    "also our model fits are probably quite biased because of the limited number of the sight - lines .",
    "nevertheless , the fitted values of @xmath124 and @xmath135 consistently indicate a small scale of the hot gas distribution .",
    "because the fits incorporate the measurements toward the two extragalactic sources , this small scale suggests that a bulk of the highly - ionized x - ray - absorbing gas arises from regions close to the galactic disk .    in this work ,",
    "we adopt the element abundances from @xcite in which the abundance ratios of o / h and ne / h are 0.58 and 0.71 times solar values given by @xcite .",
    "the real ism abundances are still very uncertain ( e.g. , savage & sembach 1996 ) .",
    "however , if the real abundances are smaller or larger by a factor than those we adopted , the derived @xmath34 ( in  [ sec : results ] ) , @xmath123 , @xmath134 , and the total mass of the hot gas will be larger or smaller by the same factor accordingly , while the inferred @xmath35 ( in  [ sec : results ] ) , @xmath124 , and @xmath135 are still valid .",
    "since the ne  ix and the o  vii / o  viii absorption lines are used here as the diagnostic of the ionization states and the gas temperature ( table  [ tab : fits ] ) , the results depend on the assumed ne / o abundance ratio . however",
    ", this dependence can be partially compensated by a change in the best - fit @xmath35 ( please refer to fig .  [",
    "fig : neo_t ] ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath34 measurements should not be very sensitive to the assumed ne / o ratio .",
    "in general , both @xmath35 and ne / o could be constrained simultaneously if multiple high s / n absorption lines of these two elements are available (  [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "we compare the above results from the x - ray absorption lines with those from observations of galactic far - uv o  vi absorption lines and diffuse soft x - ray emission .",
    "although the o  vi absorption doublet ( 1031.93 and 1037.62  ) has commonly been detected in the spectra of both extragalactic and galactic sources , the nature of the absorbing gas is still very uncertain .",
    "the o  vi population peaks at @xmath157 k , near the peak of the cooling curve of a cie plasma .",
    "therefore , such intermediate - temperature gas is expected primarily at the interfaces between the cool / warm clouds and the hot gas , consistent with the finding that about half of distinct high - velocity o  vi absorbers have h  i counterparts @xcite .",
    "the bulk of the observed galactic o  vi density can be well described as a patchy exponential distribution with a scale height between 2.3 and 4 kpc ( e.g. , zsarg et al .",
    "this scale height is greater than that inferred from our disk modeling of the x - ray absorption lines , which may indicate an evolutionary sequence of the hot gas .",
    "the x - ray - absorbing gas should also be responsible for some of the o  vi population .",
    "we use the constrained @xmath123 and the cie ionization fraction of o  vi at @xmath152 k to estimate the o  vi midplane density as 2.6(1.9 , 3.5 ) @xmath158 cm@xmath73 , which is @xmath159 of the value obtained from an o  vi survey @xcite .",
    "therefore , a significant fraction of the o  vi absorption could arise from the x - ray - absorbing hot gas .",
    "interestingly , the tightly constrained mean velocity dispersion of the o  vi - absorbing gas @xcite agrees well with the oxygen thermal velocity ( @xmath160 km  s@xmath65 ) at @xmath152 k , but is substantially greater than the velocity ( @xmath161 km  s@xmath65 ) at the o  vi peak temperature .",
    "of course , much of the o  vi line velocity dispersion may arise from turbulent and/or differential motion ( e.g. , due to the circular rotation of the disk and halo of the galaxy ) .",
    "detailed cross - correlation between the o  vi and x - ray absorbing gas along individual sight - lines may provide insights into the connection between the o  vi- and x - ray - absorbing gases .",

    "the bulk of this enhancement may arise from the galactic bulge ( e.g. , wang 1998 ; almy et al .",
    "the three sources ( x1118 + 480 , x0614 + 019 , and x0929314 ) , in which no absorption line is detected , are all toward outer galactic regions with relatively low sxb emission ; x1118 + 480 and x0614 + 019 are also very close to us .",
    "our estimated temperature and density of the x - ray - absorbing hot gas are between those inferred from the modeling of the x - ray emission gas in the solar neighborhood and the galactic bulge @xcite .",

    "<S> we present an x - ray absorption line spectroscopic study of the large - scale hot interstellar medium ( hism ) in the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we detect ne  ix k@xmath0 absorption lines in the _ chandra _ grating spectra of seven galactic low - mass x - ray binaries . </S>",
    "<S> three of these sources also show absorption of o  vii  k@xmath0 , o  vii  k@xmath1 , and/or o  viii  k@xmath0 . both centroid and width of the lines </S>",
    "<S> are consistent with a galactic hism origin of the absorption . by jointly fitting the multiple lines , accounting for line saturation and assuming the collisional ionization equilibrium , we estimate the average absorbing gas temperature as @xmath2 k ( 90% confidence errors ) . </S>",
    "<S> we further characterize the spatial density distribution of the gas as @xmath3 ( a disk morphology ) or @xmath4^{-1 } \\times10^{-3 } { \\rm~cm^{-3}}}$ ] ( a sphere morphology ) , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the distances from the galactic plane and galactic center ( gc ) respectively . </S>",
    "<S> since nearly all the sight - lines with significant absorption lines detected are somewhat toward gc and at low galactic latitudes , these results could be severely biased . </S>",
    "<S> more observations toward off - gc sight - lines and at high latitudes are urgently needed to further the study . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the results demonstrate the excellent potential of x - ray absorption line spectroscopy in the study of the hism . </S>"
