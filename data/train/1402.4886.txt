    "the well known @xmath2-queens problem asks for the number of ways to place @xmath2 nonattacking queens on an @xmath1[d : n ] chessboard .",
    "a more general question separates the number of pieces from the size of the board ; that is the @xmath0-queens problem , which asks for the number of ways to place @xmath0[d : q ] nonattacking queens on an @xmath1 board .",
    "this paper is part  iii of a series  @xcite in which we develop a general method for solving such questions and apply it not only to queens but to other pieces of the type called `` riders '' , whose moves have unlimited distance .",
    "we convert the chess problem into a geometry problem : moves become hyperplanes in @xmath3 ; the @xmath1 board becomes the set of @xmath4-fractional lattice points in the unit square ; and the number of nonattacking configurations becomes a linear combination of the numbers of @xmath0-tuples of these lattice points that lie in subspaces determined by the move hyperplanes .",
    "the ultimate goal is to produce a usable general formula for any such problem , but that is probably impossibly difficult because it requires complete knowledge of configuration theorems in the real plane .",
    "still , we provide important information about the nature of such a formula .",
    "we proved in part  i that in each such problem the number of solutions is a quasipolynomial function of @xmath2that means it is given by a cyclically repeating sequence of polynomials as @xmath2 varies  and that the coefficient of each power of @xmath2 is ( up to a factor ) a polynomial function of @xmath0 . in part",
    "ii we narrowed our focus to the square board and found , for instance , that the coefficients of the very highest powers of @xmath2 do not vary periodically with @xmath2 , or at most have period 2 .",
    "we briefly review the essentials from parts  i and ii in section  [ essentials ] .",
    "this part is the capstone of the series . in it",
    "we repeatedly apply the theory from parts  i and ii to gain detailed information on the counting functions for a well - behaved family of pieces that we name `` partial queens''those rider pieces whose moves are a subset of those of the queen .",
    "first , we explicitly calculate the coefficients of the four highest powers of @xmath2 for partial queens .",
    "surprisingly , we are also able to prove formulas for the _ periodic _ parts of the coefficients of the next two highest powers of @xmath2 ( but not for the nonperiodic parts ) .",
    "we further establish the highest and lowest powers of @xmath0 and their coefficients within the coefficient of each power of @xmath2 .",
    "these results combine to form our main theorem , theorem  [ p : hvdiag ] .",
    "the proof of this theorem , which comprises the remainder of section  [ coeffs ] , requires us to determine the counting quasipolynomials for all low - codimensional subspaces in the lattice of intersections of move hyperplanes . in section  [ two - three ] , we further apply our theory to calculate the number of nonattacking placements of two and three partial queens on a square board of any size and the number of combinatorially distinct nonattacking configurations of three partial queens , which turns out to be determined by the number , not the kind , of moves .    a deeper reason we study this set of pieces is that our ultimate object is to find out what factors control properties of the counting formula , such as the period ( the length of a repeating cycle in the cyclically repeating polynomials ) , the periods of the individual coefficients of powers of @xmath2 , formulas for the coefficients in terms of the set of moves of the piece , or anything that will let us predict aspects of the counting functions by knowing the moves of the piece under consideration . for",
    "this partial queens can be a valuable test set of pieces , not as hard as general riders but varied enough to suggest patterns for counting functions .",
    "indeed , it was the formulas and their proofs for partial queens that led us to several of the general properties proved in parts  i and ii .",
    "in part  iv , next in the series , counting function properties that we establish here ( supplemented by a theorem in part  v ) will let us prove some of the specific formulas for bishops and queens derived empirically through extensive computation , or brilliantly intuited , by kotovec  in  @xcite .",
    "we conclude part  iii with questions related to our results and methods , and we append a dictionary of notation .",
