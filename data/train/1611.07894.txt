    "dynamical decoupling ( dd ) represents a powerful tool in magnetic resonance studies in general and in particular for the wide - ranging applications using the negatively charged nitrogen vacancy ( nv ) colour center in diamond @xcite . in dd protocols ,",
    "a sequence of microwave @xmath0 pulses repeatedly inverts the electronic state of the nv . if the pulse rate exceeds the width of the environmental spectral density this permits effective decoupling from magnetic noise arising from the surrounding bath of nuclear spins , extending electronic coherence times by orders of magnitude @xcite . however , wherever the characteristic time of the sequence ( for the case of equally spaced pulses , the pulse interval @xmath1 ) is resonant with the environment spins , the converse is true : system - environment interactions are magnified , allowing the detection of individual nuclear spins @xcite , spin clusters @xcite and even their manipulation for use as quantum registers @xcite .",
    "this two - fold advantage offered by dd , in simultaneously extending the sensor coherence time , thus increasing data acquisition time , while enhancing signal contrast so as to permit sensitive detection of weakly coupled nuclear spins , has led to intense interest in the technique . the experimental signature of resonant coupling to an environmental spin is a ` dip ' in the measured nv coherence . the challenge has been to relate both the position and shape of the dip to the underlying atomic - scale structure of the nuclear target ; to devise protocols which mitigate pulse errors and optimise dip visibility as well as sharpness , since narrow dips allow better resolution of multiple spins with similar frequencies .",
    "experimental analysis has commonly been treated with semi - classical noise theory @xcite and geometric approaches @xcite .",
    "however , floquet analysis was recently introduced @xcite as a natural framework of analysis for quantum spin - sensing when periodic dd sequences are applied .",
    "the method relates observed coherence dips to avoided crossings in an underlying spectrum of floquet eigenvalues ; the shape and depth of the coherence dips are determined by the width of the avoided crossings .",
    "this framework adds not only new intuitive understanding of the coherence behaviors , but allows also accurate quantitative treatment of a wide range of situations , including when the coupling between the nv and detected spins is weak or strong , as well as for generalised pulse sequences and pulse shapes .",
    "it was recently found that common robust sensing schemes , such as the xy family give rise to so - called _ spurious _ signals at anomalous pulse spacings @xcite ; these were identified also in more complex robust schemes ( axy8 ) @xcite .",
    "this can lead to difficulties in characterising nuclear spins and was determined to be a consequence of the finite - duration of microwave pulses . for the xy family of sequences ,",
    "signals were seen at 2,4 , and 8 times the expected signal from a nuclear target .    in this paper",
    "we show floquet theory offers a unified approach to the ` expected ' and ` spurious ' dips , enabling one to obtain closed - form expressions for both dip positions and shapes .",
    "the physical insights offered allow for manipulation of the avoided crossing widths for improving detection sensitivity and resolution .     and a @xmath2 state .",
    "a frequent convenient approximation is to assume that the dynamics of an environmental spin is given from a period - averaged hamiltonian @xmath3 with dips in coherence occurring at pulse spacing @xmath4 .",
    "we demonstrate in section [ sec : resolution ] that spurious dips can be used to increase resolution for the detection of multiple isolated spins . *",
    "( b ) * the floquet eigenspectrum for @xmath3 is given by @xmath5 , but shows the characteristic floquet structure of dressed states shifted by integer multiples of @xmath6 ( sometimes termed ` multi - photon states ' ) .",
    "in this case , level degeneracies correspond to true crossings . * ( c ) * the effect of the dd pulses , for the ideal @xmath7 case , is to turn some crossings into avoided crossings . a coherence dip , of strength determined by the width of the crossing ,",
    "can then be seen .",
    "* ( d ) * for the general @xmath8 case , all remaining crossings can potentially become avoided crossings : these are typically narrow , and yield sharp weaker dips .",
    "our main finding is to show that we can determine these analytically ; a key result of this work is eq .",

    "it can be shown that the behaviour is given by an eigenvalue equation , @xmath18 quite analogous to a time - independent ( but infinite ) schrdinger equation , but where in place of a hamiltonian , we diagonalise instead the ( hermitian ) floquet operator : @xmath19 \\label{floqueth}\\ ] ] to obtain the corresponding floquet states @xmath20 and floquet quasienergies @xmath21 .",
    "previously @xcite , the simple case of nuclear spin detection with a cpmg sequence of idealised , infinitely - sharp @xmath22-pulses ( where the pulse duration @xmath7 ) , allowed certain simplifications : it was in fact straightforward to obtain floquet states and quasienergies by direct diagonalisation of the one - period unitary @xmath23 , constructed by concatenating the evolution between pulses .",
    "for general pulses , this procedure would not be adequate ; e.g. for pulses of finite duration , the eigenvectors and quasienergies @xmath24 now depend on pulse duration ; construction of the one - period evolution by concatenation becomes cumbersome . in the present work ,",
    "it becomes essential to obtain a full diagonalisation of the floquet operator with eq .",
    "[ floqueth ] .    when solving eq .",
    "[ floqueteq ] , a usual procedure is to write the hamiltonian : @xmath25 in terms of a time - independent component @xmath26 and a time - periodic potential @xmath27 . for nanoscale nmr applications , @xmath26 would represent the spin hamiltonians , including zeeman terms and spin - spin interactions ; while @xmath28 would represent the effect of the microwave pulses .",
    "typically , the floquet operator is diagonalised in the basis of @xmath26 .",
    "while this allows accurate numerical solutions , it offers comparatively little physical insight .",
    "+ however , the key part of our approach is to show that we can consider instead an equivalent rotating - frame hamiltonian : @xmath29 where @xmath3 is time - independent , _ average hamiltonian _ , while @xmath30 is an effective time - periodic potential , dependent on pulse duration , that couples the average hamiltonian eigenstates .    in fig .",

    "the additional index @xmath36 is a consequence of the invariance of floquet states to translations in @xmath37 by integer multiples of @xmath38 .",
    "the floquet theorem is the temporal analogue of the bloch theorem and analogously to the band structure seen in lattice dynamics in condensed matter systems , the floquet eigenspectrum has additional levels structures , corresponding to quasienergy shifts of single quanta in @xmath39 .",
    "hence the unperturbed spectrum has degeneracies wherever a pair of eigenvalues @xmath40 differ by an integer multiple of @xmath39 ( see below ) .",
    "however , in this case , degeneracies yield true crossings and no coherence dip is seen .    *",
    "( ii ) * for the case @xmath41 , when we apply @xmath0-pulses which approximate ideal @xmath22-spikes , some crossings become anti - crossings and the usual structure of coherence dips appears .",
    "the width of the crossing ( and hence dip shape and visibility ) depends crucially on the matrix elements of the floquet operator . in the dressed state basis where @xmath42 : @xmath43 whether or not a dip is seen can be understood , to first order , if we consider the diagonal contributions to be dominant so the levels may still be labelled by the unperturbed basis @xmath44 .",
    "if the off - diagonal matrix element of @xmath45 is non - zero , then the degeneracy between the corresponding levels will be lifted , creating an avoided crossing which causes a coherence dip . for @xmath46 only @xmath47 : for the usual dynamical decoupling scenario , the bath evolution in the two subspaces corresponding to the electronic states of the nv sensor remains fully independent .    *",
    "( iii ) * finally , we consider and illustrate in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) the general case @xmath48 where we apply @xmath0-pulses of finite duration . in this case",
    "we find there are non - zero couplings for the case @xmath49 so here potentially , all crossings are avoided crossings .",
    "these connect previously uncoupled ( albeit degenerate ) levels , hence turning true crossings into avoided crossings and generating new , ` spurious ' , coherence dips .",
    "the paper is constructed as follows : in the next section ( section [ sec : floqham ] ) we explain how to construct the floquet hamiltonian matrix and in particular , how to calculate explicitly the matrix elements of @xmath30 .",
    "we exploit the fact that the dynamics at an avoided crossing reduces to an effective two - state system in order to obtain analytical forms for the coherence functions . in section [ sec :",
    "singlespins ] we apply the method to the sensing of hyperfine coupled spins and show how to obtain analytically the shape and magnitude of the coherence dip for pulses of arbitrary duration @xmath50 and for pulse sequences with arbitrary pulse positions . tuning the pulse sequence can open and close avoided crossings thus allowing new control over both expected and spurious coherence dips , and hence the effective coupling to nuclear targets . a key result of this work is an expression for spurious coherence dips given in eq .",
    "[ eq : lspurious ] and shown , in section [ sec : numerics ] , to be in excellent agreement with full numerics . in section [ sec : resolution ] we demonstrate how the small width of spurious avoided crossings equates to a significant increase in spectral resolution and in section [ sec : conclusion ] , we conclude .",

    "this approximation is adequate whenever @xmath50 is much less than the nuclear signal period , so that the detected spin states do not evolve appreciably over the duration of the pulse ; and only a modest number of pulses sequence repetitions @xmath17 are applied so that cumulative errors arising from these effects remain insignificant .    in this case",
    "the coupling matrix reduces to @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the usual stepped modulation function ( see fig .",

    "the new frame instantaneously flips along the @xmath68-axis at each pulse .",
    "we show here that the transformation to a rotating frame is equally applicable for pulses of finite width .",
    "as found in recent studies @xcite the finite duration of pulses must be taken into account , especially where increasing number of pulses are applied : the total phase accumulation time during pulses @xmath69 can become comparable or even greater than during @xmath70 if the number of pulses , @xmath71 , is sufficiently large .",
    "we now obtain the modulation functions for the finite - duration pulses .",

    "this induces a sinusoidal curve between @xmath74 during the pulse as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulses](b ) .",
    "the unitarity of the transformation to the rotating frame then requires that the transverse modulation functions , @xmath75 , be non - zero , again see fig .",

    "the rotation is such that a unit vector @xmath77 becomes @xmath78 by the end of the pulse .    for an isolated top hat pulse",
    "the transformation of @xmath53 is simple to calculate ; however , the history of previous pulses must also be taken into account .",

    "we have defined a new set of modulation functions for realistic pulse sequences that generalise the single step modulation function used to model infinitely sharp microwave pulses .",
    "these modulation functions can be calculated for any periodic pulse sequence and are crucial for deriving an analytical model of the spurious signals produced by realistic pulses .",
