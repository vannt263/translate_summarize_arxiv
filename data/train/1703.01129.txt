    "the successful isolation of graphene@xcite followed by over a  decade of its intense study has triggered the development of a vast area of research on a variety of two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystals , whose properties substantially differ from those of their bulk counterparts @xcite . among these materials",
    "particularly much attention is currently attracted by semiconducting transitional metal dichalcogenides ( s - tmds ) which exhibit robust optical properties .",
    "the research on these materials is driven by both scientific curiosity and a prospect of 2d optoelectronic applications .",
    "one of the most intriguing properties of atomically - thin s - tmds is the possibility of accessing the valley degree of freedom using circularly polarized light @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of this approach paved the way to study @xmath2 and @xmath3 parameters of the valley degree of freedom , i.e. , the inter - valley relaxation @xcite and valley coherence @xcite .",
    "such experiments are typically carried out at cryogenic temperatures , which allows one to minimize the influence of thermal effects obscuring the investigated phenomena .    on the other hand ,",
    "the bulk of application - oriented studies on s - tmd monolayers is carried out at room temperature . due to extremely high exciton binding energy ( of hundreds of mev @xcite ) and short radiative lifetime ( in the range of picoseconds @xcite ) ,",
    "the optical properties of s - tmd monolayers remain robust under such conditions , as evidenced by efficient room - temperature photoluminescence ( pl ) @xcite .",
    "a disparity between these two regimes immediately raises a question about the changes in the intermediate temperature range , which is of particular interest , since even as basic quantity as the pl intensity exhibits a non - monotonic dependence on temperature @xcite .     with the magnetic field is responsible for the dip in the field dependence of the localized exciton optical orientation efficiency .",
    "after ref .",
    "[ schemat],height=340 ]    in this letter we present a study of temperature dependence of the magnetic - field - induced polarization enhancement ( fipe ) of the optical orientation of localized excitons ( les ) in ws@xmath0 and wse@xmath0 monolayers .",
    "earlier investigations @xcite established a link between the occurence of the fipe for monolayer wse@xmath0 and the inter - valley relaxation of dark excitons , which could precede the localized excitons in the relaxation path ( see fig .",
    "[ schemat ] ) .",
    "the key element in the proposed model was the process of inter - valley relaxation of the dark excitons , which could be effectively suppressed by the magnetic field .",
    "regardless of its rate , the inter - valley relaxation is stopped by localization of the dark excitons ( conversion to the population of localized excitons ) .",
    "thus , the analysis of the polarization degree of the subsequent localized exciton recombination shed some light on the nature of inter - valley relaxation of dark excitons , which is much more elusive than the analogous relaxation of bright excitons @xcite .",
    "the experiments described in this paper were performed on 2 sets of samples : monolayers of ws@xmath0 and wse@xmath0 . in each case",
    "the monolayer flakes were obtained by mechanical exfoliation of bulk crystals involving the use of a chemically clean back grinding tape and a polydimethylsiloxane stamp .",
    "the exfoliated flakes were non - deterministically transferred onto si substrates covered with either 90 nm thick ( wse@xmath0 ) or 300 nm thick ( ws@xmath0 ) layer of thermally grown sio@xmath0 .",
    "prior to that step the substrates were ashed with oxygen plasma to rid their top surfaces of possible organic contaminants .",
    "the monolayers of interest were first identified by their distinctive optical contrast and then double checked with photoluminescence and raman scattering measurements .",
    "our optical investigations were based on photoluminescence spectroscopy .",
    "the samples were excited using either 561  nm or 647  nm continuous - wave diode lasers .",
    "the emitted light was analyzed using a  0.5  m spectrometer equipped with a ccd camera .",
    "the polarization state of the light was controlled by means of a  combination of glan - taylor polarizers and achromatic @xmath4 waveplates incorporated in the excitation as well as in the detection path .    during the experiments ,",
    "the samples were placed in a variable temperature insert ( vti ) of a helium cryostat mounted inside a superconducting magnet .",
    "all measurements were carried out in the faraday geometry .",
    "so far the fipe effect has been only observed in wse@xmath0 monolayers @xcite . in the reported experiments a rather weak magnetic field of @xmath5 mt was shown to significantly enhance the efficiency of the optical orientation , @xmath6 , of the localized excitons , leading to a  dip - like feature in the @xmath6 dependence at @xmath7 .",
    "this observation was interpreted as related to the field - dependent inter - valley relaxation of the dark excitons .",
    "the fact that the energetically lowest excitonic state is optically dark in wse@xmath0 monolayers @xcite has been a crucial point in the interpretation of the observation of the fipe .",
    "monolayer ws@xmath0 is another system with an optically inactive exciton ground state , and as such might be expected to exhibit the fipe too .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] presents the effect of optical orientation of excitons in a  ws@xmath0 monolayer at low temperature ( @xmath8  k ) .",
    "the optical orientation manifests itself as a difference between the pl spectra measured in two circular polarizations upon circularly polarized excitation , as seen in fig . [",
    "fig1](a ) .",
    "such a difference is observed with different strength for various emission lines , which correspond to the recombination processes involving either free or localized excitons .",
    "both kinds of excitons can be distinguished on the basis of their lifetime , as free excitons decay in single picoseconds while localized excitons can live for up to a few nanoseconds @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the according time - resolved data were obtained in an auxiliary experiment using a streak camera and pulsed excitation of the pl , which allowed us to obtain reference time - gated spectra plotted with green and black dashed lines in fig . [ fig1](a ) .",
    "the signal drawn with a black curve was integrated in a window from 200  ps to 1050  ps after the laser pulse , i.e. , in the time range after the recombination of free excitons when only the localized excitons contributed to the spectrum . using this method we unequivocally determined that the lines denoted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) by x and cx@xmath9 are related the the free excitons ( neutral and charged , respectively ) . due to its intermediate lifetime",
    ", the line cx@xmath0 can not be easily classified as arising from either free or localized excitons .",
    "based on the results of reflectivity experiments on similar samples@xcite , we tentatively ascribe it to another type of a charged exciton .",
    "still , in the following analysis for the ws@xmath0 monolayer we will limit ourselves to the three lowest - energy lines ( l@xmath9-l@xmath10 ) in the spectrum , which can be unambiguously attributed to the localized excitons .    similarly to the approach used for monolayer wse@xmath0 @xcite , we have repeated the measurements of optical orientation for various magnetic fields , with the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b - f ) .",
    "as expected , each of the lines recognized as originating from the localized states exhibits the effect of robust fipe , i.e. , a  significant variation of the optical orientation efficiency at a  rather weak magnetic field of 2022  mt . upon application of the magnetic field the optically - induced polarization",
    "is clearly enhanced , which may be interpreted as a signature of the slowdown of inter - valley relaxation in the dark exciton population@xcite .",
    "interestingly , the fipe is also observed for the line denoted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) as cx@xmath9 , most probably related to the free charged excitons @xcite . in its present form , our model does not automatically account for this effect , which requires a special treatment , e.g. , the assumption that dark excitons contribute at least partially to the formation of the trions",
    ". a verification of this assumption would necessitate precise polarization- and time - resolved measurements on gated structures , which remain beyond the scope of this work .",
    "a separate issue is the relative amplitude of the fipe ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](d - f ) ) .",
    "depending on the particular localized exciton line , the amplitude of this effect in ws@xmath0 monolayer is equal to about 2 percentage points .",
    "it is significantly weaker than the effect observed for monolayer wse@xmath0 , which is about 25 percentage points @xcite .",
    "such a disparity can not be explained by differences in the overall optical orientation efficiency , which was quite similar under our experimental conditions ( @xmath11% for monolayer ws@xmath0 and @xmath12% for monolayer wse@xmath0 at @xmath13  mt , respectively ) .",
    "we can speculate that the discussed disparity reflects a different interplay between the exciton localization time and the rate of inter - valley relaxation of the itinerant excitons .",
    "in particular , already at @xmath7 the localization time in a  ws@xmath0 monolayer might be short compared to the inter - valley relaxation time . under such conditions ,",
    "an additional extension of the relaxation time by the magnetic field would have a limited effect , as in the case of the experiment .",
    "this conjecture will be revisited when discussing the temperature dependence of the width of the dip in the field dependence of the orientation efficiency .",
    "having established that monolayer ws@xmath0 also exhibits the fipe effect similar to that displayed by monolayer wse@xmath0 , we repeated measurements for both systems at different bath temperatures .",
    "an overview of the observed changes is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in both materials",
    "the increase in temperature leads to a  systematic reduction of the pl intensity of the le lines , which is interpreted in terms of thermal activation ( de - localization ) of the les @xcite .",
    "this quenching effect limits the range of experimentally feasible temperatures to about 60  k , particularly for monolayer wse@xmath0 . within this limit",
    "we were able to accurately determine the efficiency of optical orientation of the le and to study its field dependence .",
    "as shown in fig . [ fig2](b ) and [ fig2](d ) , the characteristic dip in @xmath6 is present also at elevated temperatures .",
    "still , its amplitude is gradually reduced upon increasing the temperature .",
    "we note that at the same time the overall optical orientation efficiency ( defined by the level at @xmath14  mt ) also decreases .",
    "yet , the disappearance of the dip is more rapid . we visualize it in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , which presents the temperature dependence of the relative amplitude of the dip , i.e. , the amplitude of the dip divided by the orientation efficiency at @xmath14  mt .",
    "the quenching of the dip amplitude is similar in both analyzed materials .",
    "notably , the reduction of the dip to half of its initial relative amplitude occurs at comparable temperature ( about 25  k for monolayer",
    "wse@xmath0 vs. 20  k for monolayer ws@xmath0 ) .",
    "monolayer and ( b ) ws@xmath0 monolayer .",
    "[ fig3],width=321 ]    the main complication associated with an analysis of the fipe amplitude is a  possible opening of other relaxation channels for the dark excitons when increasing the temperature .",
    "much more reliable is the second characteristic of the dip observed in the optical orientation efficiency , namely its width .",
    "temperature dependence of the extracted width ( half width at half maximum , hwhm ) is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a , b ) and evidences a  qualitatively different behavior of wse@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 monolayers . within the experimental accuracy",
    "the latter system exhibits a  constant width of the dip in the @xmath6 dependence , while for wse@xmath0 the dip becomes clearly broader upon increasing the temperature .",
    "this observation can be confirmed directly by comparing the magnetic field dependence of the optical orientation efficiency at low ( 6.5  k ) and elevated ( 30  k ) temperature , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](c , d ) .",
    "monolayer and ( b ) ws@xmath0 monolayer .",
    "panels ( c ) and ( d ) show a direct comparison between the shapes of the profile at 6.5  k and 30  k for wse@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "[ fig4],width=321 ]    our interpretation of the observed behavior is related to the temperature variation of the underlying relaxation processes . in general , the width of the dip in the optical orientation efficiency reflects the magnetic field which slows down the inter - valley relaxation of the dark excitons to the time scales of the competing localization process .",
    "both of these rates depend on temperature , but in the studied range we expect a  significant variation of the inter - valley relaxation rate .",
    "this expectation is based on the fact that the exchange interaction behind the inter - valley relaxation scales as the square of the wave vector , @xmath15 @xcite , and is therefore proportional to the temperature of the excitons .",
    "if the rate of the localization process is less dependent on the temperature ( e.g. , because of low phonon population in the relevant temperature range ) then the width of the dip should increase accordingly , as higher and higher magnetic field is required to counteract the increase in the inter - valley relaxation rate .",
    "the scenario described above is fully consistent with the data obtained for monolayer wse@xmath0 ( fig . [ fig4](a ) ) , but does not agree with the results for monolayer ws@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ) , despite that a  similar temperature dependence of the dark exciton inter - valley relaxation rate is expected in both cases .",
    "a  possible explanation of this inconsistency is different relation between the rates of the discussed processes .",
    "if the localization rate outpaces the inter - valley relaxation rate even at @xmath7 then the width of the dip will not correspond to slowing down of the latter one to the value of the former one .",
    "instead , the width of the dip would correspond to the magnetic field which reduces the inter - valley relaxation to a given fraction ( say , by factor of 2 at hwhm ) , independent of the threshold value of the localization rate .",
    "the presented reasoning can be illustrated in a simple way with the following equations .",
    "in the model sketched in fig .",
    "[ schemat ] the valley polarization degree of the localized exciton varies with time as @xmath16 however , the quantity relevant for the experiment is the final ( i.e. , after the localization but before the recombination ) polarization degree of the localized excitons , which can be obtained by integrating separately each of the dark exciton populations with a decay rate @xmath17 . in that way",
    "we obtain the expected degree of polarization of the photoluminescence : @xmath18 assuming that @xmath19 is the only variable parameter , we can derive the relation between its value at hwhm of the dip and at @xmath7 : @xmath20 and therefore : @xmath21 eq .",
    "[ eq : hwhm ] clearly shows the two regimes .",
    "if @xmath22 ( case more suitable for monolayer wse@xmath0 ) then @xmath23 . the magnetic field needed to supress growing @xmath24 to the threshold of @xmath17 is larger and larger , hence the increasing dependence in fig . [",
    "fig4](a ) .",
    "conversely , if @xmath25 ( case applicable to monolayer ws@xmath0 ) then @xmath26 .",
    "standard mechanisms of dyakonov - perel type predict that @xmath27 , where the shape function @xmath28 is not related to the @xmath24 value itself .",
    "in such a case , the magnetic field required to reduce @xmath19 to the half of its initial value is constant ( independent of @xmath24 ) , which explains the behavior illustrated in fig . [ fig4](b ) .    in our considerations we neglected a number of additional effects , such as the influence of other relaxation pathways ( e.g. , including the bright excitons ) or temperature dependence of the localization or de - localization rate .",
    "similarly , our working assumptions of @xmath22 or @xmath25 should be regarded as serving illustrative purposes only , since the actual difference between these rates might be less pronounced .",
    "still , on the qualitative level our model satisfactorily explains the experimental data suggesting that the decay of the dark exciton population is more rapid in monolayer ws@xmath0 than in monolayer wse@xmath0 .",
    "in summary , we have shown that the application of a small magnetic field significantly enhances the efficiency of optical orientation not only in wse@xmath0 but also in ws@xmath0 monolayers .",
    "thus , we confirm our original hypothesis that the b - enhanced optical orientation is characteristic of s - tmd monolayers in which the energetically lowest excitonic state is dark ( optically inactive in the first approximation ) .",
    "the amplitude of this enhancement is observed to be suppressed by temperature for both wse@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 monolayers . in particular , the b - enhanced optical orientation becomes hardly detectable at temperatures above 50k .",
    "the characteristic range of magnetic fields where the enhancement is observed is however found to expand with temperature in monolayer wse@xmath0 whereas is independent of temperature in monolayer ws@xmath0 .",
    "this distinct behavior is interpreted in terms of different regimes for the respective rates for intervalley relaxation and decay of dark excitons .",
    "we anticipate that the intervalley relaxation of dark excitons is fast as compared to their decay in monolayer wse@xmath0 while the opposite relation holds for monolayer ws@xmath0 .",
    "our observation undoubtedly requires further investigation that will provide it with not only phenomenological but also theoretical explanation .",
