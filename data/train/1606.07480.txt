    "multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems refer to systems with multiple antennas implemented at the transceiver nodes .",
    "they exploit spatial diversity to provide high data rate and link reliability @xcite . in conventional mimo systems ,",
    "the number of antennas is usually moderate ( e.g. , the lte standard allows for up to 8 antenna ports ) .",
    "recently , large - scale mimo systems or massive mimo , where hundreds of antennas are implemented at the transceiver nodes , attract a lot of attention @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that , due to the large scale , the antennas can form sharp beams toward desired terminals , thus providing high spectral and energy efficiencies . besides , the effects of small - scale fading and interference can be significantly reduced with linear signal processing , such as maximal - ratio - combining ( mrc ) , maximal - ratio - transmission ( mrt ) , and zero - forcing ( zf ) @xcite .",
    "the performance of massive mimo systems have been widely studied in the literature @xcite . in @xcite , for the uplink of massive mimo systems with mrc or zf , the deterministic equivalence of the achievable sum - rate is derived by using the law of large numbers .",
    "the following power scaling laws are shown . with perfect channel state information ( csi ) , the user and/or relay power can be scaled down linearly with the number of antennas while maintaining the same signal - to - interference - plus - noise - ratio ( sinr ) ; when there is csi error ( where minimum mean - squared error ( mmse ) estimation is used ) and the training power equals the data transmit power , the power can only be scaled down by the square root of the number of antennas .",
    "another work on the energy efficiency and power efficiency of a single - cell multi - user massive mimo network is reported in @xcite , where a bayesian approach is used to obtain the capacity lower bounds for both mrt and zf precodings in the downlink .",
    "it is shown that that for high spectral efficiency and low energy efficiency , zf outperforms mrt , while at low spectral efficiency and high energy efficiency the opposite holds . while the channel models used in @xcite are rayleigh fading , ricean fading channel is considered in @xcite in massive mimo uplink , where the csi is also obtained with mmse estimator .",
    "sum - rate approximations on the mrc and zf receivers are obtained using the mean values of the components in the sinr formula .",
    "the derived power scaling law is that when the csi is perfect or ricean factor is non - zero , the user transmit power can be scaled down inversely proportional with the number of antennas while maintaining the same sinr level .",
    "otherwise , the transmit power can only be scaled down inversely proportional to the square root of the antenna number .    while the aforementioned work analyses the sum - rate and power scaling law , there are also some work on the sinr distribution and outage probability . in @xcite , the sinr probability density function ( pdf ) of mrt precoding is derived in closed - form in the downlink of a single - cell multi - user massive mimo network .",
    "besides , the asymptotic sinr performance is analysed when the number of users remains constant or scales linearly with the number of antennas .",
    "for the same network , in @xcite , the outage probability of mrt precoding is derived in closed - form .",
    "the authors first obtain the distribution of the interference power , based on which the outage probability is derived in closed - form .",
    "while only small - scale fading is considered in @xcite , both small - scale ( rayleigh ) fading and large - scale ( log - normal ) fading are considered in @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the pdf of the sinr of mrc receiver is approximated by log - normal distribution , and the outage probability is derived in closed - form .",
    "the analysis shows that the shadowing effect can not be eliminated by the use of a large number of antennas .",
    "current results on massive mimo show fantastic advantages of utilizing a large number of antennas in communications",
    ". a natural expansion of the single - hop massive mimo systems is the two - hop massive mimo relay networks , where the relay station is equipped with a large number of transmit and receive antennas to help the communications of multiple source - destination pairs .",
    "relaying technology has been integrated to various wireless communication standards ( e.g. , lte - advanced and wimax release 2 ) as it can improve the coverage and throughput of wireless communications @xcite .",
    "early studies focus on single - user relay networks and various relaying schemes , such as amplify - and - forward ( af ) and decode - and - forward ( df ) , have been proposed @xcite . with ever - increasing demands for higher performance , recently , multi - user relay networks have gained considerable attention @xcite . an important issue in multi - user relaying is how to deal with inter - user interference@xcite . by utilizing massive mimo ,",
    "the interference is expected to be significantly reduced and the network performance will be significantly improved .",
    "research activities on massive mimo relay networks are increasing in recent years @xcite . in @xcite , for a single - user massive mimo relay network with co - channel interferences at the relay , the ergodic capacity and outage probability of mrc / mrt and zf relaying schemes are derived in closed - forms .",
    "the more general multiple - user massive mimo relay networks are analysed in @xcite .",
    "depending on the structure of the network model , the works can be divided to the following two categories .    in @xcite , a network with multiple single - antenna users , one massive mimo relay station and one massive mimo destination is considered .",
    "this model applies to the relay - assisted uplink multiple - access network . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that with perfect csi , and infinite relay and destination antennas , the relay or user transmit power can scale inversely proportional to the number of antennas without affecting the performance .",
    "when there is csi error , the user or relay power can only scale down with the square root of the number of antennas , given that the training power equals the transmit power .",
    "the same network is also considered in @xcite while the co - channel interference and pilot contamination are considered in @xcite , and channel aging effect is considered in @xcite .",
    "the effects of these factors on the power scaling are shown therein .",
    "another type of network is the relay - assisted multi - pair transmission network , where multiple single - antenna sources communicate with their own destinations with the help of a massive mimo relay @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the sum - rates of multi - pair massive mimo relay network with mrc / mrt and zf relaying under perfect csi are analysed for one - way and two - way relaying respectively . in both work , with the deterministic equivalence analysis",
    ", it is shown that the sum - rate can remain constant when the transmit power of each source and/or relay scales inversely proportional to the number of relay antennas . in @xcite , the same network model as @xcite",
    "is considered for mrc / mrt relaying where the number of relay antennas is assumed to be large but finite .",
    "the analysis shows that , when the transmit powers of the relay and sources are much larger than the noise power , the achievable rate per source - destination pair is proportional to the logarithm of the number of relay antennas , and is also proportional to the logarithm of the reciprocal of the interferer number . in @xcite ,",
    "the full - duplex model is considered for one - way mrc / mrt relaying and a sum - rate lower bound is derived with jensen s inequality .",
    "while the above work assume perfect csi at the relay , recent study has turned to networks with csi error @xcite , which is more practical and challenging to analyse . in @xcite , a one - way massive mimo relay network model is considered , where mmse estimation is used to obtain the csi . while @xcite uses zf relaying and assumes that the csi error exists in both hops , @xcite uses mrc / mrt relaying and assumes that the csi error only exists in the relay - destination hop . in both work ,",
    "the power scalings of the sources and relay for non - vanishing sinr are discussed under the assumption that the training power equals the data transmission power . compared with previous power scaling law results ,",
    "the analysis in @xcite are more comprehensive by allowing the power scaling to be anywhere between constant and linearly increasing with the number of relay antennas .",
    "@xcite is on a two - way mrc / mrt relaying network with csi error . with deterministic equivalence analysis",
    ", it is shown that when the source or relay power scales inversely proportional to the number of relay antennas , the effects of small - scale fading , self - interference , and noise caused by csi error all diminish .    in this work",
    ", the performance of mrc / mrt relaying in a one - way massive mimo relay network with csi error is investigated .",
    "our major differences from existing work are summarized as blow .    *",
    "our system model is different from all the aforementioned existing work in relaying scheme , csi assumption , or communication protocol .",
    "the work with the closest model is @xcite , where the csi error is assumed to exist in the relay - destinations hop only .",
    "we use a more general model where csi error exists in both hops . * in our scaling law analysis , a general model for network parameters ,",
    "including the number of source - destination pairs , the csi quality parameter , the transmit powers of the source and the relay , is proposed . in this model ,",
    "the scale exponent with respect to the relay antenna number can take continuous values from 0 to 1. in most existing work , only a few discrete values for the power scaling , e.g. , @xmath0 , are allowed .",
    "although @xcite allow continuous exponent values , they constrains the number of sources as constant and the training power equals to the transmit power . *",
    "while in existing work , the asymptotically deterministic equivalence analysis is based on the law of large numbers , we use the quantized measure , squared coefficient of variation ( scv ) , to examine this property .",
    "as law of large numbers only applies to the summation of independent and identical distributed random variables , by using the scv , we can discuss the asymptotically deterministic property of random variables with more complex structures .",
    "based on these features that distinguish our work from existing ones , our unique contributions are listed as below .    1",
    ".   firstly , by deriving a lower bound on the sum - rate , we investigate the performance scaling law with respect to the relay antenna number for a general setting on the scalings of the network parameters .",
    "the law provides comprehensive insights and reveals quantitatively the tradeoff among different system parameters .",
    "deterministic equivalence is an important framework for performance analysis of massive mimo systems .",
    "we derive a sufficient condition on the parameter scales for the sinr to be asymptotically deterministic .",
    "compared with existing work , where only specific asymptotic cases are discussed , our derived sufficient condition is more comprehensive .",
    "it covers all cases in existing works , and shows more asymptotically deterministic sinr scenarios .",
    "besides , for the sinr to be asymptotically deterministic , the tradeoff between different parameter scales is also discussed .",
    "3 .   through the scaling law results ,",
    "we show that for practical network scenarios , the average sinr is at the maximum linearly increasing with the number of relay antennas .",
    "we prove that the sufficient and necessary condition for it is that all other network parameters remain constant .",
    "furthermore , our work shows that in this case the interference power does not diminish and it dominates the statistical performance of the sinr . by deriving the pdf of the interference power in closed - form",
    ", expressions for outage probability and average bit error rate ( aber ) are obtained .",
    "while existing work mainly focus on the constant sinr case , this linearly increasing sinr case , suitable for high quality - of - service applications , has not been studied .",
    "the remaining of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section , the system model including both the channel estimation and data transmission under mrc / mrt relaying is introduced .",
    "then the performance scaling law is analyzed in section [ sec : scaling ] . in section [ sec : deter ] , the asymptotically deterministic sinr case is discussed .",
    "the linearly increasing sinr case is investigated in section [ sec : linear ] .",
    "section [ sec : simu ] shows the simulation results and section [ sec : con ] contains the conclusion .",
    "we consider a multi - pair relay network with @xmath1 single - antenna sources ( @xmath2 ) , each transmitting to its own destination .",
    "that is , @xmath3 sends information to destination @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that the sources are far away from the destinations so that no direct connections exist . to help the communications , a relay station",
    "is deployed @xcite .",
    "the number of antennas at the relay station , @xmath6 , is assumed to be large , e.g. , a few hundreds @xcite .",
    "in addition , we assume @xmath7 because under this condition , simple linear relay processing , e.g. , mrc / mrt , can have near optimal performance in massive mimo systems @xcite .",
    "denote the @xmath8 and @xmath9 channel matrices of the source - relay and relay - destination links as @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the channels are assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) rayleigh fading , i.e. , entries of @xmath10 and @xmath11 are mutually independent following the circular symmetric complex gaussian ( cscg ) distribution with zero - mean and unit - variance , denoted as @xmath12 .",
    "the assumption that the channels are mutually independent is valid when the relay antennas are well separated .",
    "the information of @xmath10 and @xmath11 is called the channel state information ( csi ) , which is essential for the relay network . in practice",
    ", the csi is obtained through channel training . due to the existence of noises and interference , the channel estimation can not be perfect but always contains error .",
    "the csi error is an important issue for massive mimo systems @xcite . in what follows",
    ", we will first describe the channel estimation model , then the data transmission and mrc / mrt relaying scheme will be introduced .      to combine the received signals from the sources and",
    "precode the signals for the destinations , the relay must acquire csi .",
    "@xmath10 , the uplink channel from the sources to the relay , can be estimated by letting the sources send pilots to the relay . in small - scale mimo systems ,",
    "@xmath11 can be estimated by sending pilots from the relay to the destinations and the destinations will feedback the csi to the relay @xcite . however",
    ", this strategy is not viable for massive mimo systems , as the training time length grows linearly with the number of relay antennas @xmath6 , which may exceed the channel coherence interval .",
    "consequently , to estimate @xmath13 , we assume a time - division - duplexing ( tdd ) system with channel reciprocity @xcite .",
    "so pilots are sent from the destinations and the relay - destination channels can be estimated at the relay station .    without loss of generality ,",
    "we elaborate the estimation of @xmath14 , and the estimation of @xmath13 is similar .",
    "since the channel estimation is the same as that in the single - hop mimo system , we will briefly review it and more details can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "denote the length of the pilot sequences as @xmath15 .",
    "for effective estimation , @xmath15 is no less than the number of sources @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "assume that all nodes use the same transmit power for training , which is denoted as @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the pilot sequences from all @xmath1 sources can be represented by a @xmath17 matrix @xmath18 , which satisfies @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath20 received pilot matrix at the relay is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the @xmath20 noise matrix with i.i.d .",
    "@xmath12 elements .",
    "the mmse channel estimation is considered , which is widely used in the channel estimation of massive mimo networks @xcite . the mmse estimation of @xmath10 given @xmath23 is @xmath24 where @xmath25 , which has i.i.d .",
    "@xmath12 elements .",
    "similarly , the mmse estimation of @xmath11 is @xmath26 define @xmath27 and @xmath28 which are the estimation error matrices . due to the feature of mmse estimation ,",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are mutual independent .",

    "elements of @xmath30 and @xmath32 are distributed as @xmath34 .",
    "define @xmath35 so @xmath36 is total energy spent in training .",
    "@xmath37 is the power of the estimated channel element , representing the quality of the estimated csi , while @xmath38 is the power of the csi error .",
    "it is straightforward to see that @xmath39 . when @xmath40 , the channel estimation is nearly perfect .",
    "when @xmath41 , the quality of the channel estimation is very poor .",
    "note that , different combinations of @xmath15 and @xmath16 can result in the same @xmath37 . for the majority of this paper ,",
    "@xmath37 will be used in the performance analysis instead of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this allows us to isolate the training designs and focus on the effects of csi error on the system performance .",
    "when we consider special cases with popular training settings , e.g. , @xmath42 and the same training and data transmission power , @xmath15 and @xmath16 will be used instead of @xmath37 in modelling the csi error .      with the estimated csi ,",
    "the next step is the data transmission .",
    "various relay technologies have been proposed @xcite . for massive mimo systems ,",
    "the mrc / mrt relaying is a popular one due to its computational simplicity , robustness , and high asymptotic performance @xcite . in the rest of this section",

    "the received signal at @xmath5 can be written as follows .",
    "@xmath61 where @xmath62 is the noise at the @xmath4th destination following @xmath12 . equation ( [ eq : recei_sig_e ] ) shows that the received signal is composed of 5 parts : the desired signal , the multi - user interference , the forwarded relay noise , the csi error term , and the noise at @xmath5 .",
    "define @xmath63 from ( [ eq : recei_sig_e ] ) , we know that @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the normalized powers of the signal , the interference , the forwarded relay noise , and the noise due to csi error respectively . with these definitions ,",
    "the sinr of the @xmath4th source - destination pair can be written as @xmath66 the achievable rate for the @xmath4th source - destination pair is @xmath67      this paper is on the performance behaviour and asymptotic performance scaling law of the massive mimo relay network .",
    "it is assumed throughout the paper that the number of relay antennas @xmath6 is very large and the scaling law is obtained by studying the highest - order term with respect to @xmath6 .    due to the complexity of the network , it is impossible to rigorously obtain insightful forms for the sinr and the achievable rate for the general @xmath6 case .",
    "instead , we find the asymptotic performance properties for very large @xmath6 with the help of lindebergy - l@xmath68vy central limit theorem ( clt ) .",
    "the clt states that , for two length-@xmath6 independent column vectors @xmath69 and @xmath70 , whose elements are i.i.d .",

    "another important concept in the performance analysis of massive mimo systems is _ asymptotically deterministic_. in many existing literature on massive mimo , a random variable sequence @xmath76 is said to be asymptotically deterministic if it converges almost surely ( a.s . ) to a deterministic value @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath78 the strong law of large numbers is usually used to derive the deterministic equivalence .",
    "the almost sure convergence implies the convergence in probability @xcite .",
    "another type of convergence that implies convergence in probability is the convergence in mean square @xcite . for a random variable sequence @xmath76 with a bounded mean",
    ", @xmath76 converges in mean square to a deterministic value @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath79 if @xmath80 the convergence in mean square requires the variances of the random variable sequence to approach zero .",
    "it has been used to define the channel hardening effects for massive mimo@xcite , where the convergence in mean square means that the effects of small - scale fading is ignorable when the number of antennas is large . besides , compared with almost sure convergence ,",
    "the convergence in mean square is more tractable for analysis .",
    "we adopt the convergence in mean square for the asymptotically scaling law of massive mimo relay network .    however , the use of the variance may cause inconvenience and sometimes confusion in performance analysis of massive mimo systems",
    ". one can always scale @xmath76 by @xmath81 with large enough @xmath82 to have the asymptotic deterministic property and the scaled random variable converges in mean square to 0 .",
    "but this does not help the performance analysis when the scaling factor @xmath83 is put back into the sinr formula .",
    "thus to avoid the scaling ambiguity , we use the squared coefficient of variance ( scv ) , defined as the square of the ratio of the standard deviation over the mean of the random variable @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the bounded mean condition is important . without this condition ,",
    "the convergence with @xmath84 may not be well defined .",
    "thus in this work , a random variable sequence @xmath76 with bounded mean is said to be asymptotically deterministic if @xmath85",
    "the general performance scaling law of the massive mimo relay network will be studied in this section .",
    "we start with analysing components of the received sinr to obtain a large - scale approximation .",
    "consequently , a lower bound on the sum - rate is derived via jensen s inequality .",
    "then the performance scaling law and conditions for favourable sinr ( non - decreasing sinr with respect to @xmath6 ) are derived .",
    "typical network scenarios are discussed .",
    "our analysis will show the relationship between the sinr scale and the parameter scales , and the trade - off between different parameter scales .      for the sinr analysis",
    ", we first derive the means and scvs of components of the sinr , i.e. , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 . with the help of clt and tedious derivations ,",
    "the following can be obtained .",
    "@xmath92 where the approximations are made by keeping the dominant terms of @xmath6 . due to the space limit",
    ", we only show the derivations of @xmath93 and @xmath94 in appendix a. the rest can be derived similarly .    with our definitions in ( [ eq : component1])-([eq :",
    "component2 ] ) and by noticing that @xmath95 $ ] , the random variables @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 all have bounded means . from ( [ eq : scv1 ] ) , we know that @xmath86 is asymptotically deterministic since its scv approaches to 0 as @xmath75 . furthermore , the decreasing rate of its scv is linear in @xmath6 , showing a fast convergence rate .",
    "thus , for large @xmath6 , we can approximate it with its mean value . while for the rest components in the sinr , their scvs depend on the scalings of network parameters ( such as @xmath1 and @xmath37 ) , which do not necessarily converge to @xmath96 .",
    "we can not assume they are asymptotically deterministic so far .",
    "with the aforementioned approximation , the sinr expression becomes @xmath97 with this simplification , the following result on the sum - rate can be obtained .",
    "the achievable rate of source @xmath4 in the massive mimo relay network has the following lower bound : @xmath98 where @xmath99 [ lemma - rate ]    as @xmath100 is a convex function of @xmath77 @xcite , according to jensen s inequality , we have @xmath101 by applying the sinr approximation in ( [ eq : sinr_e_app ] ) , we have @xmath102+\\frac{1}{mpp_c}+\\frac{k}{m^2pp_c^2}+\\frac{k}{m^2}(\\frac{1}{p_c}-1)^2+\\frac{2(1-p_c)}{mp_c}+\\frac{k(1+\\frac{k}{mp_c}+\\frac{1}{pp_cm})}{mp_cq}},\\nonumber\\\\ & \\approx & \\frac{1}{\\frac{2k}{mp_c}+\\frac{k^2}{m^2p_c^2}+\\frac{1}{mpp_c}+\\frac{k}{m^2pp_c^2}+\\frac{k}{mp_cq}+\\frac{k^2}{m^2p_c^2q}+\\frac{k}{m^2pp_c^2q } } = \\widetilde{\\rm sinr}_{i } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the approximation is made by ignoring the lower order terms of @xmath6 when @xmath103 .",
    "thus the lower bound in ( [ rate - lb ] ) is obtained .    from ( [ rate - lb ] ) and ( [ eq : sinr_exp ] )",
    ", we can see that the achievable rate lower bound increases logarithmically with @xmath6 and @xmath37 .",
    "but its increasing rates with @xmath48 , @xmath53 , @xmath104 are slower than logarithmic increase .",
    "note that , by using the method in lemma 1 of @xcite , the sum - rate expression in ( [ rate - lb ] ) can also be obtained .",
    "but with the method in @xcite , the derived expression is an approximation , while our derivations show that it is a lower bound for large @xmath6 . on the other hand , from lemma 1 of @xcite , we know that the lower bound becomes tighter when the number of relay antennas @xmath6 or the number of sources @xmath1 increases .",
    "the parameter @xmath105 has the physical meaning of asymptotic effective sinr corresponding to the achievable rate lower bound . due to the monotonic relationship in ( [ rate - lb ] ) , to understand the scaling law of the achievable rate is equivalent to understanding the scaling law of @xmath105 .",
    "now , the scaling law of the asymptotic effective sinr , @xmath105 , will be analysed to show how the system performance is affected by the size of the relay antenna array and other network parameters . to have a comprehensive coverage of network setups and applications , for all system parameters including the number of source - destination pairs @xmath1 , the source transmit power @xmath48 , the relay transmit power @xmath53 , and the csi quality parameter @xmath37 , a general scaling model with respect to @xmath6 is used .",
    "assume that @xmath106 where the notation @xmath107 means that when @xmath84 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 have the same scaling with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "in other words , there exists positive constants @xmath110 and natural number @xmath111 , such that @xmath112 for all @xmath113 .",
    "thus the exponents @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 represents the relative scales of @xmath1 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 with respect to @xmath6 . for practical ranges of the system parameters , we assume that @xmath121 .",
    "the reasons are given in the following .",
    "* the scale of @xmath1 . following typical applications of massive mimo , the number of users should increase or keep constant with the number of relay antennas .",
    "thus @xmath122 . on the other hand , the number of users @xmath1 can not exceed @xmath6 since the maximum multiplexing gain provided by the relay antennas is @xmath6 .",
    "thus , @xmath123 . * the scale of @xmath48 and @xmath53 . following the high energy efficiency and low power consumption requirements of massive mimo , the source and relay transmit power should not increase with the number of relay antennas .",
    "but they can decrease as the number of relay antennas increases with the condition that their decreasing rates do not exceed the increasing rate of the antenna number .",
    "this is because that the maximum array gain achievable from @xmath6 antennas is @xmath6 .",
    "a higher - than - linear decrease will for sure make the receive sinr a decreasing function of @xmath6 , which contradicts the promise of massive mimo communications .",
    "thus @xmath124 . *",
    "the scale of @xmath37 . from the definition of @xmath37 in ( [ eq : pc ] )",
    ", we have @xmath125 , thus @xmath126 .",
    "this is consistent with the understanding that the csi quality will not improve as the number of relay antennas increases , as the training process can not get benefits from extra antennas @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , since similar to the data transmission , the total training energy should not has lower scaling than @xmath127 , we conclude that @xmath120 should not have a higher scaling than @xmath6 .",
    "thus @xmath128 .    in our parameter",
    "modelling , the exponents can take any value in the continuous range @xmath129 $ ] .",

    ", we refer to the case where @xmath135 as the _ favourable - sinr scenario_. the condition for favourable - sinr is presented in the following corollary .    the necessary and sufficient condition for the massive mimo relay network with mrc / mrt relaying and csi error to have favourable - sinr is @xmath137 .",
    "\\label{cond - scaling}\\ ] ] [ coro-1 ]    this is a straightforward extension from ( [ snr - scaling ] ) of theorem [ thm-1 ] .    the scaling law in ( [ snr - scaling ] ) illustrates quantitatively the concatenation of the scalings of different parameters and their effects on the network performance .",
    "the condition in ( [ cond - scaling ] ) forms a region of @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 that makes the sinr favourable .",
    "they provide guidelines for the design of the massive mimo relay network .",
    "next , we discuss the physical meanings of ( [ snr - scaling ] ) and ( [ cond - scaling ] ) , and several popular network setups .",
    "firstly , in ( [ snr - scaling ] ) , @xmath114 and @xmath116 appears as a summation . according to their definitions in ( [ exponents - def ] ) ,",
    "the summation is the scaling exponent of @xmath138 .",
    "then in ( [ snr - scaling ] ) , @xmath139 , which equals @xmath140 , is the minimum of the power scaling exponents of @xmath48 and @xmath141 . recall that @xmath48 is the per - source transmit power and @xmath141 is the average relay power allocated to each source .",
    "thus , from ( [ snr - scaling ] ) , we can see that the performance scaling of the sinr is determined by two factors : 1 ) @xmath139 , which is the worse per - source power scaling of the two steps , and 2 ) @xmath37 , which is the csi quality .",
    "further , ( [ snr - scaling ] ) shows that @xmath131 , which represents the scale of the system sinr , is a decreasing function of both @xmath139 and @xmath117 . thus high transmit power and better csi quality result in improved performance . there is a natural tradeoff between the worse per - source power and channel training ( e.g. , between the data transmission phase and the training phase ) , and one can compensate for the other in performance scaling .",
    "for the two - step communication , the worse step dominates the overall performance .",
    "the condition in ( [ cond - scaling ] ) implies @xmath142 , which means that for the sinr to be favourable , the scaling of the per - source - destination - pair relay power should be no less that @xmath127 .",
    "this also shows a tradeoff between @xmath114 and @xmath116 .",
    "recall that @xmath143 .",
    "that is , with extra relay antennas , we can serve more users or use less relay power for the same level of performance , but the improvement in the two aspects has a total limit .",
    "for example , two cases satisfying the constraint are 1 ) @xmath144 , @xmath145 ; 2 ) @xmath146 , @xmath147 .",
    "the first case means that when the number of users increases linearly with the number of relay antennas ( i.e. , @xmath144 ) , the relay power must remain constant ( i.e. , @xmath145 ) , and thus the goal of saving relay power can not be achieved .",
    "the second case is the opposite : when the relay power is scaled inversely proportional to the number of relay antennas , the goal of serving more users can not be achieved .      in this subsection",
    ", we further elaborate the scaling law in ( [ snr - scaling ] ) and the condition in ( [ cond - scaling ] ) for popular network settings .    1 .",
    "first , we consider the case of @xmath148 , corresponding to perfect or constant csi quality case ( e.g. , @xmath36 increases linearly in @xmath6 ) . from ( [ snr - scaling ] ) and ( [ cond - scaling ] ) ,",
    "the sinr scaling exponent is @xmath149 and the necessary and sufficient condition for favourable sinr is @xmath142 .",
    "its physical meaning is that , when the csi is perfect and for the sinr to be favourable , the most power - saving design is to make both the per - source power of the two hops decrease linearly with the number of antennas .",
    "thus , when the csi quality is good , we can design the network to serve more users and/or save power consumption , while maintain certain quality - of - service .",
    "2 .   next , we consider the case of @xmath150 , which is equivalent to @xmath151 .",
    "this means that the total energy used in training and the csi quality are inversely proportional to the relay antenna number . in this case , the sinr scaling exponent is @xmath152 to have favourable sinr , from ( [ cond - scaling ] ) , we need @xmath153",
    ". that is , the source data transmit power , the per - source relay power , and the number of users should all remain constant .",
    "this shows that the csi quality is key to the performance of the massive mimo relay network . with low csi quality ,",
    "all the promising features of the massive mimo network are gone .",
    "3 .   for a general @xmath154 ,",
    "favourable sinr requires @xmath155 .",
    "that is , the worse transmit power per - source of the two steps can not be lower than @xmath156 .",
    "this shows the trade - off between the training phase and the data transmission phase .",
    "4 .   for the most power saving setting where @xmath157 or @xmath158 , the per - source transmit power of either the two steps scales as @xmath127 . to have favourable sinr , @xmath148 is needed .",
    "thus , the per source transmit power of either or both steps can be made inverse proportional to the number of relay antennas .",
    "but at the same time , the csi quality must remain at least constant , not a decreasing function of @xmath6 . if furthermore @xmath147",
    "( e.g. , the number of source - destination pairs @xmath1 remains constant ) , we have for this setting @xmath48 or @xmath53 scales with @xmath127 , which is the major power scaling scenario considered in the literature .",
    "it is obvious that our results cover this case , and shows more insights by considering the scales of @xmath1 and @xmath37 .",
    "while in previous discussions , @xmath117 is treated as a free parameter , next , we consider the special case of @xmath159 and @xmath42 .",
    "the condition @xmath159 corresponds to the practical scenario that user devices always use the same transmit power , no matter for training or data transmission .",
    "it is a common assumption in the literature @xcite .",
    "@xmath42 is the minimum training length for effective communications @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that , for maximal - ratio processing , the case achieves the maximal spectral efficiency .",
    "we can see that in this case , @xmath160 .",
    "consequently , the sinr scale exponent is @xmath161 for the sinr to be favourable , we need @xmath162 . if further @xmath147",
    ", i.e. , the number of source - destination pairs is constant , favourable sinr requires @xmath163 , i.e. , the source transmit power can be reduced by @xmath164 at maximum .",
    "this is same as the conclusion as in @xcite .",
    "but note that our model is different from @xcite and is more general .",
    "another popular setting is to have the number of source - destination pairs increase linearly with @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath144 .",
    "one example is assuming that @xmath165 is a constant as @xmath6 increases . from ( [ snr - scaling ] ) and ( [ cond - scaling ] ) , for this case , the sinr scaling exponent is @xmath166 and to have favourable sinr",
    ", we need @xmath167 .",
    "thus , to support such number of source - destinations , the csi quality must be high and at the same time the relay power can not decrease with @xmath6 .",
    "one important concept in massive mimo systems is asymptotically deterministic . for example , with receiver combining and/or pre - coding at the base station or relay station , random variables such as the signal power and interference power which are random in finite - dimension cases converge to deterministic values as the number of relay antennas is large @xcite .",
    "this effect is also called channel hardening @xcite . with channel hardening ,",
    "the small - scale fading effect is negligible , and so is the channel variance in the frequency domain .",
    "this not only simplifies many design issues but also enables performance analysis via the deterministic equivalences of the random variables , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "one important question is thus when the massive mimo system have asymptotically deterministic sinr for the corresponding performance analysis to be valid . in this section ,",

    ", the distribution of @xmath283 converges to @xmath284 when @xmath84 .",
    "then @xmath285 has a gamma distribution with shape parameter @xmath286 and scale parameter @xmath287 .",
    "thus , we can obtain @xmath288 as @xmath7 , we have @xmath289 .",
    "thus the mean of @xmath290 is @xmath291 .",
    "the received sinr is asymptotically deterministic when its scv approaches zero as @xmath75 .",
    "however , due to the complex structure of the sinr expression , it is highly challenging to obtain its scv directly . alternatively , as is shown in section iii , @xmath295 is asymptotically deterministic , thus for the sinr to be asymptotically deterministic , the sufficient and necessary condition is that the denominator of the formula in ( [ eq : asym ] ) is asymptotically deterministic .",
    "one sufficient condition is that the scv of the denominator denoted as @xmath296 , is no larger than @xmath297 for some constant @xmath298 , given any positive number @xmath189 , @xmath299 .",
    "but for practical applications of the deterministic equivalence analysis in large but finite - dimension systems , we consider the scenario that the scv decrease linearly with the number of antennas or faster .",
    "the derived condition is thus sufficient but not necessary . ] .",
    "this can be expressed as @xmath300 from ( [ eq : asym ] ) , we have @xmath301 and since @xmath302 , we have @xmath303 thus ( [ eq : scv ] ) is equivalent to that @xmath304 for some constant @xmath305 .    [ lemma : var ]",
    "a sufficient condition for ( [ eq : var_scv ] ) is that the variance of each term in ( [ eq : var_scv ] ) scales no larger than @xmath127 , i.e. , the maximum scale order of @xmath306 , @xmath307 , @xmath308 , @xmath309 , and @xmath310 is no larger than @xmath127 .",
    "the variance of @xmath311 is the summation of two parts : the variances of each term , and the covariance of every two terms .",
    "now , we will prove that if the variances of each term scales no larger than @xmath127 , their covariance also scales no larger than @xmath127 .",
    "to make it general and clear , we define @xmath312 , where @xmath313 is a finite integer and @xmath314 s are random variables . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath315 has the highest scale among all @xmath316 s and @xmath317 , where @xmath318 .",
    "the variance of @xmath319 is @xmath320 by the definition of covariance , @xmath321 takes the maximum value when @xmath314 s are linearly correlated , i.e. , @xmath322 . in this case",
    ", we can obtain that @xmath323 where we have defined @xmath324 .",
    "as @xmath315 has the highest scale , we have @xmath325 scales no higher than @xmath136 , that is , there exists constants @xmath326 s such that @xmath327 .",
    "thus @xmath328 , and consequently @xmath329 scales no higher than @xmath330 .",
    "given lemma [ lemma : var ] , we only need to find the condition for the variances of @xmath331 , @xmath332 , @xmath333 , @xmath334 , and @xmath335 to scale no larger than @xmath127 . using the results on the variances of sinr components ,",
    "the variances of the terms can be obtained as @xmath336 where the scaling behaviour at the end of each line is obtained from the definitions of the scaling exponents in ( [ exponents - def ] ) and considering the constraints in ( [ cond - scaling ] ) .",
    "then , we can see that the condition for the scaling order of each term to be no higher than @xmath127 is that both following constrains are satisfied .",
    "@xmath337 combining ( [ cond - scaling ] ) and ( [ eq : cond_2 ] ) , we get the sufficient condition for the sinr to be deterministic in ( [ eq : suff - con ] ) .",
    "linearly increasing sinr means that the sinr scaling exponent is 1 , i.e. , @xmath338 .",
    "thus the sinr can be formulated as @xmath339 from the sinr scaling law in ( [ snr - scaling ] ) , we can see that the sufficient and necessary condition for @xmath338 is @xmath340 ( note that @xmath341 $ ] ) .    with the parameter values",
    ", we can calculate that the scvs of @xmath295 and @xmath342 scales of @xmath127 .",
    "therefore , they are asymptotically deterministic and can be approximated with their mean values .",
    "on the other hand , the scvs of @xmath343 , @xmath344 , @xmath345 , and @xmath346 are constant .",
    "we analyze their behaviour next .",
    "@xmath347 also , @xmath90 and @xmath91 have the same distribution . as we mainly consider the non - trivial case that @xmath348 , we have @xmath349 , especially when the csi quality @xmath37 is high .",
    "besides , the mean of @xmath344 scales as @xmath127 , and its variance scales as @xmath350 .",
    "thus the variance of this term is also much smaller than @xmath351 .",
    "therefore , @xmath351 dominates the random behaviour of the sinr and other terms can be approximated with their mean values .",
    "thus the sinr approximation in ( [ eq : sinr_app_high ] ) is obtained , where only dominant terms of @xmath6 are kept .",
    "when @xmath352 , @xmath353 then , using clt , @xmath87 has an exponential distribution with parameter @xmath354 .",
    "then , the pdf can be approximated as @xmath355 , which is the same as ( [ cf - pdf - e ] ) for @xmath352 .",
    "now , we work on the more complicated case of @xmath348 .",
    "firstly , @xmath356 with the help of clt , as @xmath357 , @xmath358 is approximately distributed as @xmath359 , and @xmath360 is approximately distributed as @xmath361 .",
    "we can further show that the covariances between @xmath358 , @xmath360 , and @xmath362 are zero , thus they are uncorrelated . for tractable analysis , we assume independence as they are gaussian distributed .",
    "now we conclude that @xmath363 has a gamma distribution with shape parameter @xmath286 and scale parameter @xmath364 , which is also defined as @xmath196 .    using clt , the covariance between @xmath363 and @xmath365 ( @xmath366 ) can be derived as @xmath367 where the proof is omitted due to save space .",
    "the correlation coefficient between the two is subsequently @xmath368 it equals @xmath369 based on the definition in ( [ eq : miu ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath87 is a summation of @xmath370 correlated random variables following the same gamma distribution . from corollary 1 of @xcite ,",
    "the pdf of @xmath87 is @xmath371 where @xmath372 are the ordered eigenvalues of the @xmath373 matrix @xmath374 , whose diagonal entries are @xmath196 and off - diagonal entries are @xmath375 , and @xmath376 s are defined iteratively as @xmath377\\delta_{j+1-m}.\\label{deltai+1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as @xmath374 is a circulant matrix whose off - diagonal entries are the same , its eigenvalues can be calculated as @xmath378 then we can show that @xmath379 substituting and into , we can get pdf of @xmath87 as in ( [ equ4 ] ) in proposition [ pro : pdf ] .",
    "notice that @xmath380 by straightforward calculations , we can obtain the closed - form pdf of @xmath87 in ( [ cf - pdf - e ] ) .",
