    "<S> several common effects are seen for all shape variables . </S>",
    "<S> the most striking observation is that the difference between nlla+nnlo and nnlo is largely restricted to the two - jet region , while nlla+nlo differ in normalisation throughout the full kinematical range . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour may serve as a first indication for the numerical smallness of corrections beyond nnlo in the three - jet region .    </S>",

    "<S> the behaviour in the two - jet region is described better by the resummed predictions than by the fixed order nnlo , although the agreement is far from perfect . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy was observed already in earlier studies based on nlla+nlo . </S>",
    "<S> it can in part be attributed to hadronisation corrections , which become large in the approach to the two - jet limit . </S>",
    "<S> a very recent study of logarithmic corrections beyond nlla for the thrust distribution  @xcite also shows that subleading logarithms in the two - jet region can account for about half of this discrepancy </S>",
    "<S> .    a precise extraction of @xmath14 from event shape data will require the inclusion of hadronisation corrections and of quark mass effects ( at least to nlo  @xcite ) , as done already in the fixed order nnlo study  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it can be anticipated that inclusion of the matched nlla+nnlo corrections results in a further improvement of the extraction of @xmath14 from event shape data over results obtained previously at nlla+nlo as well as at nnlo . </S>",
    "<S> the principal shortcomings of the up - to - now default nlla+nlo studies were the substantial renormalisation scale uncertainty and the sizable scatter of values of @xmath14 obtained from different shape variables . it was observed recently , that a fixed - order nnlo extraction  @xcite reduces the renormalisation scale uncertainty by a factor 1.3 compared to nlla+nlo and eliminates the scatter between different observables </S>",
    "<S> . it will be very interesting to see the impact of the matched nlla+nnlo calculation on the extraction of @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> we will address this issue in a future study .    </S>",
