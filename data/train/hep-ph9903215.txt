    "the observation by the cdf and d0 collaborations  @xcite of a very heavy top quark with a mass of about  175gev , close to the indirect prediction from fits of precision electroweak data  @xmath4gev  @xcite , has been an important confirmation of the standard model  ( sm ) .",
    "still , important open problems remain : why is the top is so heavy and is it really a point like particle ?",
    "a curious numerical coincidence between the mass and vacuum expectation value  @xmath5gev sets the top quark yukawa coupling close to unity .",
    "as has been stressed some time ago  @xcite , because of such unique properties , the top quark might provide for the first time a window to the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking and even `` new physics '' beyond .",
    "a possible signal would be deviations from the sm predictions of the interactions of the top quark with other fields .",
    "therefore it is important to study and measure all top quark couplings , in particular the coupling to the @xmath6-boson and the @xmath7-quark which is responsible for almost all top quark decays .",
    "therefore , events with the production of a single top quark are extremely interesting at different colliders , because they are directly proportional to the @xmath2  vertex .",
    "thus one can hope to measure the structure of the vertex and possible deviations from the sm predictions with a high accuracy .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that the processes of single top production and decay involve light higgs production simultaneously ( cf .  the discussion in  @xcite ) .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath2 vertex in @xmath3 collisions has been described in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the possible accuracy in the determination of the structure of the @xmath2 vertex at the upgraded tevatron collider and at the lhc .",
    "improving on previous considerations  @xcite , we perform a complete tree level calculation , taking into account contributions from anomalous operators to the @xmath8 vertex , the production of @xmath9 and @xmath1 , which includes the single top signal together with the irreducible backgrounds . we have included the nlo corrections to the single top part  @xcite . based on an analysis of the singularities of feynman diagrams and on explicit calculations",
    "we identify the set of the most sensitive variables and their corresponding optimal cuts .",
    "this allows us to obtain a clean single top sample above the background and a handle on possible deviations from the sm expectations .",
    "single top production at hadron colliders has been studied by a number of authors ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "so far , the most complete set of sm processes contributing to the single top rate has been studied in  @xcite and the most accurate nlo calculations to the main processes have been presented in  @xcite . in recent papers",
    "@xcite , complete monte carlo  ( mc ) analysises of the single top signal versus backgrounds have been presented .",
    "the feynman diagrams for all processes contributing to the single top production rate have been presented previously ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) and include virtual  @xmath6 @xmath10-channel exchange , @xmath6-gluon fusion and @xmath11 production .",
    "the first process is the simplest @xmath12  reaction , while the @xmath6-gluon process includes @xmath13  parton diagrams . in order to resum the large qcd corrections from @xmath14 splitting in the latter ,",
    "they are combined with the @xmath12 process involving a @xmath7 quark in the initial state  @xcite and the corresponding piece of the @xmath14 splitting function is subtracted in order to avoid double counting .",
    "finally , the @xmath11 production process gives a large contribution to total single top production at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "however we will not consider this process here , because it does not contribute to the topologies which we will be interested in .",
    "moreover , it has a final state similar to top pair production and after a suitable background subtraction it is less sensitive to the @xmath2  vertex ( cf .",
    "the discussion of the corresponding process in @xmath15  collisions  @xcite ) .    irrespective of the different strategies employed",
    ", the analysises of  @xcite and  @xcite have both shown that the single top production rate is large enough to be visible above the backgrounds using proper cuts .",
    "this is possible despite the fact that the background reduction is much more complicated compared to the case of top pair production .",
    "however , in order to probe the @xmath2  vertex , one must check for possible deviations from the sm predictions and then all sm contributions become part of the background . therefore it is necessary to find even stronger cuts , defining phase space regions where the deviations from the sm predictions for single top production will be most prominent . approaching this problem",
    "we perform an accurate calculation of the two processes    [ eq : pp->bbw(j ) ] @xmath16    which include simultaneously the single top signal and the irreducible backgrounds .    = pt    (

    "all the calculations have been performed with the computer program comphep  @xcite , including the proper mapping of singularities and smoothing in singular variables  @xcite .",

    "for processes involving @xmath6-gluon fusion  ( [ eq : pp->bbwj ] ) , the choice of scale is more subtle , as has been pointed out by  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have pragmatically fixed the scale by matching our lo cross sections to the nlo results of  @xcite .",
    "this procedure leads us to a factorization scale of  @xmath30 .",
    "the fact that this scale is reasonably close to the top quark mass shows that the corrections are not very large and serves as a _ a posteriori _ justification of the pragmatical procedure .",
    "therefore we have taken into account the important parts of the nlo corrections in the hard kinematical region which we are interested in .",
    "finally , we notice that the requirement of a double @xmath7-tag in the hard kinematical region under consideration suppresses the contributions from the processes with the @xmath7-quark in the initial state .",

    "in fact , the @xmath31 coupling is as in the sm with the coupling @xmath32 very close to unity , as required by present data  @xcite .",

    "as always , the correct mapping of the singularities of the feynman diagrams is absolutely crucial in order to achieve numerically stable results in the mc integration over phase space . in this section , however , we will focus on a different aspect of the singularities , that has impact on physics analysises .    unless particular cuts are applied ,",
    "most of the contributions to the rate of any given process come from phase space regions close to the singularities . indeed , this simple observation forms the basis for most of our intuition for finding selection cuts to enhance the signal . in many cases ,",
    "it is however also possible to reverse this argument and use the singularities to systematically devise cuts for background suppression .",
    "this approach requires an analysis of _ all _ feynman diagrams contributing to the process , signal and background .    shifting the focus from signal enhancement to background suppression in this manner is useful for processes with a high rate of both signal and background that can afford to lose some rate .",
    "we will demonstrate that single top production falls into this class .",
    "the general procedure compares the set  @xmath45 of variables with singularities from all signal diagrams with the same set  @xmath46 from all background diagrams , reducible and irreducible . if  @xmath47 , i.e.  there are variables with singularities in the background diagrams which are regular in all signal diagrams , then it is obvious that singularities in these variables should be cut out as strongly as possible .",
    "it turns out that the number of different singular variables is very limited in the cases of practical interest and a general classification allows recommendations for choosing sensitive variables .",
    "the application of this approach to neural net methods will be discussed in  @xcite .    shifting our attention back to the special case of single top production ,",
    "we note that the single signal diagram for  ( [ eq : pp->bbw ] ) has only one singular variable : the invariant mass  @xmath48 of the top decay products near the top pole  @xmath49 .",
    "these contributions have to be kept , of course .    in the background diagrams , the only @xmath10-channel singularities are in the invariant mass  @xmath50 of the @xmath51 pair at @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and  @xmath54 from the coupling to neutral vector bosons and higgs particles .",
    "since the ckm matrix element  @xmath55 is tiny , we can ignore the multiperipheral diagrams with the @xmath56-coupling and we only have to consider the @xmath24-channel variables  @xmath57 and  @xmath58 .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath24-channel variables are not directly observable in hadron collisions .",
    "we can , however , use the corresponding transverse momentum as a surrogate . in this case , these are the @xmath59 of the @xmath51-pair or , equivalently , of the @xmath6-boson .    from this simple argument , we conclude that the invariant mass  @xmath50 and the transverse momentum @xmath60 are the most effective variables for expressing cuts for the process  ( [ eq : pp->bbw ] ) .",
    "analogous considerations for the diagrams in figure  [ fig : feyn - jbbw ] leads to the variables  @xmath50 , @xmath61 and  @xmath60 ( the latter are now no longer equivalent ) for the process  ( [ eq : pp->bbwj ] ) . here , the transverse momentum distributions of single jets  @xmath62 and  @xmath63 are problematic , because the same singularity occurs for both signal and background diagrams and the signal and the background will have similar shapes .",
    "therefore cuts on these variables must be defined with discretion to achieve a balance between the competing goals of good jet identification and high signal rate .",
    "of course , there are more variables that can have different distributions for the signal and background , but which are not directly related to the singularities of feynman diagrams .",

    ", we have given the cross sections for several sub - processes at both colliders in table  [ tb : crs1 ] .",

    "the results of this comparison are shown in the table  [ tb : par ] .",
    "one can see that a @xmath78  lc will outperform the tevatron ( assuming a systematic uncertainty of @xmath79 ) by a factor of two to five . nevertheless , the upgraded tevatron is expected start with physics runs long before a lc",
    ". the upgraded tevatron will therefore be able to perform the first direct measurements of the structure of the @xmath2  coupling .",
    "the lhc will only be able to rival a @xmath78  lc , when the systematic uncertainties can be kept very small ( on the order of @xmath80 )",
    ". this goal will be very difficult to achieve . in the more realistic scenario of @xmath81 systematic uncertainties",
    ", the lhc will improve the tevatron limits considerably , but it will fall short of a high energy lc by a factor of three to eight , depending on the coupling under consideration .    in the present analysis , we have not included sources of reducible background  @xcite to single top production at hadron colliders . however , this reducible background is sufficiently suppressed in the kinematical regions corresponding to our optimized cuts .",
    "more detailed simulations and the actual analysis should nevertheless include the tails of these background distributions as well .",
    "finally , we mention that the exclusion contours in figures  [ fig : anom_coup_tev ] and  [ fig : sistem_unc ] can can be combined with constraints  @xcite on the right - handed coupling @xmath82 from the cleo measurement of  @xmath83  @xcite to improve the limit on the left - handed coupling  @xmath40 .",
    "we have presented the results of a complete tree level calculation of the processes @xmath84 and  @xmath1 , taking into account the contributions of anomalous @xmath2  operators .",
    "these final states simultaneously include the single top signal with subsequent decays and irreducible standard model backgrounds .",
    "we have determined the most sensitive variables from an analysis of the singularities of the feynman diagrams in phase space , in order to achieve optimal background suppression without sacrificing too much of the signal .",
    "it was shown that the optimized cuts allow to suppress the background rate drastically and to extract limits on anomalous coupling parameters .",
    "the accuracy at the lhc is expected to be better by a factor of two to three compared to the upgraded tevatron .",
    "nevertheless , the tevatron measurements will provide the first direct information on the structure of the @xmath2  coupling .",
    "for the higher accuracy at lhc , it is essential to measure the two final states separately , to perform efficient double @xmath7-tagging at high @xmath59 and to control the systematic uncertainties at a leverl betetr than  @xmath79 .    at the lhc , one can reduce the dependence of the results on parton distribution functions , qcd scales , etc .  by using the asymmetry of single top and single anti - top production .",
    "remains significant after all cuts .",
    "reducible backgrounds are expected to be less important in the phase space region corresponding to the optimized cuts  @xcite .",
