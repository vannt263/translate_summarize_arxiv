    "it has been realized for some time that topological defects are unlikely to be the origin of the structure in the present universe @xcite .",
    "therefore the observation of their decay products , in the form of cosmic rays or high energy neutrinos , becomes the most straightforward way to search for these remnant structures from grand unified phase transitions @xcite .",
    "such search represents an example of fundamental particle physics that can only be done with cosmic beams .",
    "we here point out that a kilometer - scale neutrino observatory @xcite , such as icecube , has excellent discovery potential for topological defects .",
    "the instrument can identify the characteristic signatures in the energy and zenith angle distribution of the signal events .",
    "it is a common misconception that different instruments@xcite , optimized to eev signals , are required to do this important science , although this is not their primary motivation .",
    "our conclusions for topological defects extend to other physics associated with @xmath0ev energies .",
    "we will illustrate our claims by demonstrating icecube sensitivity to :    * generic topological defects with grand - unified mass scale @xmath1 of order @xmath2gev and a particle decay spectrum consistent with all present observational constraints@xcite , * superheavy relics , normalized to the z - burst scenario@xcite where the observed ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) of @xmath3ev energy and above are locally produced by the interaction of superheavy relic neutrinos with the cosmic neutrino background radiation @xcite , * neutrinos produced by superheavy relics which themselves decay into the uhecrs @xcite , and * the flux of neutrinos produced in the interactions of uhecr cosmic rays with the microwave background @xcite , the so called greisen neutrinos .",
    "this flux , which originally inspired the concept of a kilometer - scale neutrino detector , is mostly shown for comparison .",
    "the basic reasons for our more optimistic conclusions about the sensitivity of a detector such as icecube are simple .",
    "unlike first - generation neutrino telescopes , icecube can measure energy and can therefore separate very high energy signals from the low energy atmospheric neutrino background by energy measurement @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "the instrument can therefore isolate high energy events over @xmath4 solid angle , and not just in the hemisphere where the neutrinos are identified by their penetration of the earth .",
    "this is of primary importance here because neutrinos from topological defects have energies high enough so that they are efficiently absorbed by the earth @xcite .",
    "the signal from above and near the horizon typically dominates the up - going neutrino fluxes by an order of magnitude .",
    "we will show that the zenith angle distribution of neutrinos associated with topological defects form a characteristic signature for their extremely high energy origin .",
    "we calculate the neutrino event rates by convoluting the @xmath5 flux from the different sources considered in this paper , with the probability of detecting a muon produced in a muon - neutrino interaction in the earth or atmosphere :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the observation time and @xmath8 the zenith angle .",
    "we assume an effective telescope area of @xmath9 , a conservative assumption for the very high energy neutrinos considered here .",
    "it is important to notice that the probability ( @xmath10 ) of detecting a muon with energy above a certain energy threshold @xmath11(threshold ) , produced in a muon - neutrino interaction , depends on the angle of incidence of the neutrinos .",
    "this is because the distance traveled by a muon can not exceed the column density of matter available for neutrino interaction , a condition not satisfied by very high energy neutrinos produced in the atmosphere .",
    "they are absorbed by the earth and only produce neutrinos in the ice above , or in the atmosphere or earth near the horizon .",
    "the event rates in which the muon arrives at the detector with an energy above @xmath11(threshold)=1 pev , where the atmospheric neutrino background is negligible , are shown in table i.    fig.1 shows the @xmath5 fluxes used in the calculations .",
    "we first calculate the event rates corresponding to the largest flux from topological defects @xcite allowed by constraints imposed by the measured diffuse @xmath12-ray background in the vicinity of 100 mev .",
    "the corresponding proton flux has been normalized to the observed cosmic ray spectrum at @xmath13ev ; see fig.2 of reference @xcite .",
    "models with p@xmath141 appear to be ruled out @xcite and hence they are not considered in the calculation . as an example of neutrino production by superheavy relic particles , we consider the model of gelmini and kusenko @xcite . in figs.2 and 3",
    "we show the event rates as a function of neutrino energy .",
    "we assume a muon energy threshold of 1 pev .",
    "we also show in both plots the event rate due to the waxman and bahcall bound @xcite .",
    "this bound represents the maximal flux from astrophysical , optically thin sources , in which neutrinos are produced in p - p or p-@xmath12 collisions .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino events are not shown since they are negligible above the muon energy threshold we are using .",
    "the area under the curves in both figs .",
    "is equal to the number of events for each source . in fig.4",
    "we plot the event rates in which the produced muon arrives at the detector with an energy greater than @xmath11(threshold ) .",
    "in fig.5 we finally present the angular distribution of the neutrino events for the different very high energy neutrino sources .",
    "the characteristic shape of the distribution reflects the opacity of the earth to high energy neutrinos , typically above @xmath15100 tev .",
    "the limited column density of matter in the atmosphere essentially reduces the rate of downgoing neutrinos to interactions in the 1.5 km of ice above the detector .",
    "the events are therefore concentrated near the horizontal direction corresponding to zenith angles close to @xmath16 .",
    "the neutrinos predicted by the model of gelmini and kusenko are so energetic that they are even absorbed in the horizontal direction as can be seen in fig.5 .    0.3 cm    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     * table i : * neutrino event rates ( per year per @xmath17 in @xmath18 sr ) in which the produced muon arrives at the detector with an energy above @xmath11(threshold)=1 pev .",
    "different neutrino sources have been considered .",
    "the topological defect models ( td ) correspond to highest injection rates @xmath19 allowed in fig.2 of @xcite .",
    "also shown is the number of events from p-@xmath20 interactions in which protons are propagated up to a maximum redshift @xmath21 @xcite and the number of neutrinos from the waxman and bahcall limit on the diffuse flux from optically thin sources @xcite .",
    "the number of atmospheric background events above 1 pev is also shown .",
    "the second column corresponds to downward going neutrinos ( in @xmath18 sr ) .",
    "the third column gives the number of upward going events ( in @xmath18 sr ) .",
    "we have taken into account absorption in the earth according to reference @xcite .",
    "icecube will detect the sum of the event rates given in the last two columns .",
    "0.5 cm    energy measurement is critical for achieving the sensitivity of the detector claimed . for muons , the energy resolution of icecube",
    "is anticipated to be @xmath22 in the logarithm of the energy , possibly better .",
    "the detector is able to determine energy to better than an order of magnitude , sufficient for the separation of eev signals from atmospheric neutrinos with energies below 100 tev .",
    "notice that one should also be able to identify electromagnetic showers initiated by electron and tau - neutrinos .",
    "their energy measurement is linear and expected to be better than @xmath23 .",
    "such eev events will be gold - plated , unfortunately their fluxes are expected to be even lower .",
    "for instance for the first td model in table i ( p=1 , @xmath24 gev and @xmath25 ) , we expect @xmath26 contained shower per year per @xmath17 above 1 pev initiated in charged current interactions of @xmath27 .",
    "the corresponding number for the gelmini and kusenko flux is @xmath28 .",
    "one should also worry about the fact that a very high energy muon may enter the detector with reduced energy because of energy losses .",
    "it could become indistinguishable from atmospheric background @xcite .",
    "we have accounted for the ionization as well as catastrophic muon energy losses which are incorporated in the calculation of the range of the muon . in the pev regime region",
    "this energy reduction is roughly one order of magnitude , it should be less for the higher energies considered here .    in conclusion ,",
    "if the fluxes predicted by our sample of models for neutrino production in the super - eev region are representative , they should be revealed by the icecube observatory operated over several years .",
