    "the universal behaviour of low - dimensional strongly correlated systems at low temperatures is determined to a great extent by the topology of the manifolds , where the ground state and low - lying excitations are determined . in strongly correlated electron liquids with high degree of degeneracy of the ground state",
    "such a manifold is presented by a collection of strings in the form of an arbitrary tangle of knotted and linked filaments .",
    "the processes of fusion and decay of the strings give rise to modifications of the tangle and , consequently , to the universal character of the quantum criticality in phase states with topological order .",
    "being a result of detailed study of electron liquids in the states with fractional hall effect , this conclusion was supported recently by the results , obtained during studying dynamics of spin @xcite and charge @xcite degrees of freedom in other low - dimensional electron systems .",
    "it is well known that statistics of excitations in @xmath0- and @xmath1-dimensional systems is connected with the braid group .",
    "quantum states in such systems are classified by irreducible representations of the braid group instead of the even ( for bosons ) or odd ( for fermions ) irreducible representations of the permutation group as ( 3 + 1)-dimensional systems .",
    "one - dimensional irreducible representations of the braid group correspond to abelian anyon states , while multi - dimensional irreducible representations describe the non - abelian states of anyons .",
    "statistics of anyon excitations is called either braid statistics or fractional statistics , because it leads to the conclusion that there exist particles with a fractional charge and spin . in the long - wavelength limit",
    "the description of non - abelian anyons is based on the effective action of the topological field theory @xcite , which contains the chern - simons term .",
    "an important particular case is the quantum group @xmath2 case , where the integer @xmath3 is the coefficient of the chern - simons action , or a level in the wess - zumino - witten - novikov theory .",
    "we can also employ another approach @xcite , based on the generalized exclusion principle .",
    "studies of the distribution function using this approach @xcite have shown that this method is equivalent to the thermodynamic bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "the equation , which determines the minimum of free energy , has the form of the hirota equation @xcite .",
    "it is well known from the theory of nonlinear equations , that this discrete equation in the continuous limit @xcite yields the known integrable hierarchies of nonlinear equations .",
    "an important feature of the derivation of discrete equations in the theory with the generalized exclusion principle is the absence of any reference to the dimensionality of the space , unlike braid statistics .",
    "formally generalized exclusion principle statistics @xcite may take place not only in low - dimensional systems .",
    "the reason of the emergence of the solutions , which exist only in low - dimensional systems , is that in the limit of large values of momentum , discrete equations in the universal sector @xcite of exclusion statistics encode actually the particle fusion rules , which take place in the conformal field theory .",
    "going over to the limit @xmath4 in discrete equations of motion , the specifity of low - dimensional situation vanishes .",
    "the features of considered statistics are summed up by the theory of tensor categories @xcite .",
    "it unifies consistently the processes of braiding and fusion of string manifolds , which are images of quasiparticle world lines . in the case of low - dimensional systems",
    "this occurs in the theory of modular tensor categories @xcite .",
    "the theory of symmetric tensor categories @xcite is applicable to the @xmath5 systems . in the last case ,",
    "restrictions on solutions of equations of motion are so strong , that all anyon states are excluded , and only bosons ( @xmath6 ) and fermions ( @xmath7 ) with the interchange phase @xmath8 remain out of anyon states .    to solve the problems of the theory of strongly correlated systems on a lattice , it is often convenient to use the theory of the braid group representation or the temperley - lieb algebra ( tla ) representations @xcite with a special value of the tla parameter . in the continuous limit , we can also employ the effective chern - simons action @xcite .",
    "in particular , to classify the hierarchy of phase states with the aid of @xmath9-dimensional spinor ginzburg - landau functional @xcite , it is convenient to use the hopf invariant @xcite , which is the @xmath10 analog of the chern - simons term .",
    "the construction of a lattice model out from the continuous theory ( even inheriting its essential properties ) is evidently an ambiguous procedure .",
    "some intuitive insight of how this can be done , based on the mentioned properties , may include the following consideration .",
    "it is well known that the chern - simons term in the action of @xmath1-dimensional systems encodes the invariant description of fluctuating aharonov - bohm vortices .",
    "the action of the doubled chern - simons theory ( for example @xmath11 @xcite ) which refers to the systems , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 invariances are not brocken , includes pairs of aharonov - bohm vortices with the opposite chiralities .",
    "it is natural to suppose that neutral pairs of aharonov - bohm vortices in such systems are plane slices of a string loop ( from the three - dimensional point of view ) .",
    "a pair of aharonov - bohm vortices are portions of the loop cutted by a plane .",
    "this means on the whole that a small loop with the scale of the order of the lattice constant induces a dimerized configuration of currents when it is projected on the plane .",
    "such a projected loop , or equivalently the dimer configuration , can be a building block for the formation of self - organized mesoscale structures in the form of nets .",
    "the increased interest to quantum dimer distributions @xcite is connected not only with the theory of resonance valence bonds or with the support originating from the experience of the exact solvable models @xcite , but it is also motivated by recent results @xcite in the field of non - abelian gauge theory .    the goal of this paper is two - fold . in the second section",
    "we will discuss the opportunities , which appear due to mapping essential configurations of the ( 3 + 0)-dimensional spinor ginzburg - landau model into lattice @xmath14 dimer configurations .",
    "we will show that two - dimensional dimer field configurations , distributed on two sub - lattices , may be obtained by projecting three - dimensional current configurations of the so - called toroid phase state . in the third section we will consider the solutions of nonlinear discrete equations of the thermodynamic bethe ansatz and",
    "will show their relation with the characteristics arising in the approach , based on the use of braid statistics .",
    "they are characterised by the quantum dimension , which is obtained as the solution of the mentioned discrete equations .",
    "we will give also some arguments in favor of stability of arising mappings of string nets , built of golden chains @xcite .",
    "in this section we show how to construct dimer distributions starting from hopf links . indeed ,",
    "knots and links of field configurations appear naturally in the long - wavelength description of @xmath10 systems with spin as follows .",
    "let us consider a gauged ginzburg - landau model for the charged two - components order parameter @xmath15 given by the free energy functional @xmath16 \\ , , \\label{g1}\\ ] ] with a generic form of the potential @xmath17 @xcite and interacting with an internal vector gauge potential @xmath18 .",
    "the components of the order parameter can be interpreted as the hopping and pairing amplitudes , respectively , in a @xmath19 model @xcite .",
    "the relations between these amplitudes can be reshaped in terms of the function @xmath20 and a real unit 3-vector @xmath21 defined by @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the pauli matrices . a residual phase - like degree of freedom",

    "that is , @xmath36 measures the linking and knotting of the filaments , which are pre - images in @xmath38 of an arbitrary chosen value @xmath39 .",
    "general arguments of the homotopic group theory @xcite ensure that @xmath40 , i.e. @xmath41 , labelling distinct sectors among all configurations of the field @xmath21 . for two linked loops one has @xmath42 , for the trefoil knot @xmath43 and etc . on the other hand , @xmath44 is the mutual linking number @xcite of the fields @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the integer @xmath36 is related @xcite to the coefficient @xmath3 in the chern - simons action .",
    "for instance , the value @xmath47 for the hopf link of two loops is equivalent to @xmath48 .",
    "but , differently from @xmath21 , the length of the vector @xmath49 is not fixed and it does not belong to a compact manifold , thus homotopy group techniques say that @xmath44 ( and @xmath50 ) in ( [ g5 ] ) is an arbitrary real numbers . furthermore , for @xmath51 is obtained with respect to the case @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "this effect is due to the interaction term @xmath53 in eq .",
    ". its contribution could be so important to completely compensate the energy contributions @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "such a situation may occur because all contributions in eq .",
    "( [ g3 ] ) are of the same order .",
    "then , one can prove @xcite the existence of inhomogeneous states with total energy smaller than in the skyrme - faddeev reduction ( i.e. @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) , if the knot is contained in a region of typical size @xmath58 and the amplitude of the momentum field @xmath59 is bounded by @xmath60 , where @xmath61 can be figured out as the `` thickness '' of the filamentary structure of @xmath49 , or @xmath21 , and @xmath62 is the packing parameter .",
    "thus , by ( [ g4 ] ) one can evaluate the decrease of energy , by a negative ( condensation energy ) contribution @xmath63 .",
    "in the optimum case of great values @xmath45 the self - dual state with @xmath64 may be considered as the ground state with @xmath65 .",
    "it is characterized by the dense packing of filaments in knots @xcite and by the condition @xmath66 when the matrix @xmath67    indeed , let us assume that the amplitude of density @xmath68 is large enough and a knot size @xmath69 is so small that the packing degree of filaments in the knot @xcite @xmath70 .",
    "the correlation lenght @xmath71 having the order of the lattice constant is determined the filament thickness .",
    "the decrease of our tuning parameter @xmath8 with the decrease of @xmath72 is accompanied by the transition to a state , in which among planar field projections the field configurations in the form of closed one - dimensional distributions are most preferable . in accordance with ginzburg s proposal , we will call this phase state with the spontaneous diamagnetism a toroid state @xcite .",
    "the phase state with zero value of the total magnetic moment @xmath73 , in which current order is characterized by a polar vector @xmath74 , that changes sign under time reversal , can be represented by the ordering of toroid moments .",
    "the toroid moment @xmath75 $ ] can be determined in the following way @xcite @xmath76 using this equation and the identity @xcite @xmath77 \\label{g8}\\ ] ] one can express the toroid moment via the degree of chirality @xmath78 $ ] in the form :    @xmath79 } { { |{\\bf r}^{\\,\\prime}-{\\bf r}^{\\,\\prime\\prime}|}}\\right ] .",
    "\\label{g9}\\ ] ]    we see that toroid moment @xmath74 is given by the biot - savart law as well as by the factor which is determined by the coulomb green function and by the field strenth @xmath80 of the hopf invariant density .",
    "the vector @xmath74 characterizes the distribution of the poloidal component of the current on the torus @xcite .",
    "the magnetic flux of this current is confined to the interior of the torus .",
    "if the degree @xmath81=\\varepsilon_{ki}\\,\\delta({\\bf r})$ ] of the @xmath82-field noncollinearity is localized at a point the toroid moment has the form @xmath83 .",
    "the toroid moment is perpendicular to the plane , where the central loop of the torus is situated , and belongs to the perpendicular plane that intersects this loop .",
    "the significant constraint of the scale of toroid configuration appears from the analysis of stability of such field distributions . as it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , that these configurations are stable with respect to @xmath84-wave perturbations if the characteristic scale of linked distribution is small enough , i.e. it is of the order of several lattice constants . therefore ,",
    "to describe topological states we have to use a lattice theory .",
    "besides , in addition , the main contributions of field configurations correspond usually to small values of topological numbers @xmath36 , @xmath44 . keeping all this in mind we can conclude that the hopf links of loop pairs ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , that after being projected on the plane , provide dimer distributions of vortex pairs which are the the most significant configurations .    .",
    "their projection into the plane presents a system of two dimers , characterized by the respective orientation of toroid moments . ]    to deal with states without the time inversion symmetry breaking , we should take into consideration totally neutral dimer configurations with antitoroidal ordering of the toroid moments .",
