    "let us consider the escape rate of the static billiard by placing a small hole at the very right ( @xmath16 ) of the ellipse ( @xmath17 in arbritrary units ) and iterating the corresponding 2d discrete mapping ( for the phase space variables @xmath15 and @xmath18 ) numerically .",
    "we employ an ensemble of @xmath19 particles with initial conditions being uniform randomly distributed in @xmath20-space .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : escsl_iv ] ( curve with @xmath21 ) .",
    "the decay approaches a saturation value @xmath22 which is caused by particles traveling on librator orbits that are not connected with the hole  @xcite . for @xmath23",
    "the saturation value is zero and it increases monotonically with increasing @xmath24 .",
    "the analytical dependence of @xmath25 on @xmath24 can be obtained by determining the number of librator type particles starting from the region bounded by the separatrix  @xcite @xmath26 this expression is in excellent agreement with the results of the numerical simulations .",
    "one can therefore conclude that varying @xmath24 allows us to control the total number of particles being emitted .",
    "we now apply harmonic oscillations to the boundary of the ellipse @xmath27 @xmath28 is the driving amplitude and @xmath29 is a phase shift which will be set to zero in the following .",
    "the dynamics of the particles is now governed by a 4d discrete mapping  @xcite : the time and position of a particle - boundary collision is described by the pair @xmath30 , the energy and direction of motion by @xmath31 .",
    "the time @xmath32 for the @xmath33th collision is determined implicitly by @xmath34 where the smallest @xmath35 that solves  ( [ eq : implicit2 ] ) has to be taken and @xmath36 is the @xmath37th collision point .",
    "the @xmath33 collision point is given by @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be obtained by inverting  ( [ eq : ellboundary ] ) .",
    "the velocity immediately after the collision @xmath40 is described by @xmath41 \\cdot \\hat { \\bm{n}}_{n+1 } $ ] , where @xmath42 is the boundary velocity and @xmath43 the inward pointing normal vector of the collisional event occurring at time @xmath32 and position @xmath44 . when iterating the underlying implicit mapping numerically the determination of @xmath32 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : implicit2 ] ) requires sophisticated numerical techniques due to many neighboring roots . as a result",
    "the corresponding simulations are computationally very demanding .",
    "we focus on the escape rates of monoenergetic ensembles consisting of @xmath45 particles is distributed uniform randomly and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 ( i ve ) and @xmath48 ( hve ) . ] with @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 for different values of the driving amplitude @xmath2 .",
    "two relevant cases can be distinguished : @xmath52 being the intermediate velocity ensemble ( i ve ) for which the initial particle velocity is of the order of the maximum velocity of the billiard boundary and @xmath53 being the high velocity ensemble ( hve ) .",
    "naturally , it would be also interesting to examine the case @xmath54 .",
    "however , the first few collisions then accelerate the particles to velocities @xmath55 and , after a short time , we encounter the situation of the i ve .",
    "@xmath56 of the i ve and hve are shown in figs .  [ fig : escsl_iv ] and  [ fig : escsl_hv ] , respectively . in both cases",
    ", there exists no saturation value as observed in the static case .",
    "a short - time exponential decay is followed by a transient and the long - time behavior ( @xmath57 ) is to a good approximation algebraic , @xmath58 , at least for the case of the i ve ( we remark that this algebraic decay has been numerically shown to exist for much longer times than illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : escsl_iv ] ) .",
    "the decay constant @xmath1 increases monotonically with increasing @xmath2 ( this fact is based not only on the four values of the drivig amplitude @xmath2 shown here , but on simulations carried out for 20 values of @xmath2 between @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) .",
    "it can be therefore concluded that tuning the driving amplitude allows us to control the decay constant @xmath1 in the long - time behavior of the decay .",
    "the division of the behavior of the escape rate into the above - mentioned regimes is even more pronounced in the case of the hve , see fig .",
    "[ fig : escsl_hv ] , although the long time tail shows substantial deviations from an algebraic behavior .",
    "the saturation value @xmath22 observed in the static case is caused by librating orbits which are gradually destroyed by the driving  ( [ eq : ellboundary ] ) thereby resulting in a non - vanishing rate @xmath62 even for large times .",
    "rather than trying to examine the 4d phase space ( since 2d intersections or projections of this 4d space are nonrepresentative and difficult to interpret ) , let us analyze the destruction of the librator orbits as follows .",
    "orbits @xmath63 in the driven ellipse can be compared to the corresponding ones of the static ellipse @xmath64 by inspecting the angular momentum @xmath12 .",
    "in contrast to the case of the static ellipse where @xmath65 , @xmath66 in the driven case , i.e. @xmath13 is no longer a constant of motion . the difference @xmath67 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : elpss ] ) upon a collision is a measure of whether a librator orbit approaches ( @xmath68 ) the separatrix or whether it moves in phase space towards ( @xmath69 ) the corresponding elliptic fixed points of the static system .",
    "two fundamental scattering processes can be identified that destroy librators by changing them into rotator orbits :    1 .",
    "_ vertical process : _ the angle of incidence of a particle upon collision does not coincide with the reflection angle due to momentum momentum transfer by the moving billiard boundary .",
    "this momentum change @xmath70 causes a vertical displacement of the particle in the pss .",
    "horizontal process : _ a particle that would hit the boundary at a certain point @xmath15 in case of a static billiard , hits the boundary in the driven case at @xmath71 , simply because it has moved . here",
    "no change of the momentum takes place .",
    "this corresponds to a horizontal displacement @xmath72 of the particle in the pss .",
    "these processes are fundamental in the sense that every change @xmath73 can be decomposed into @xmath74 , where @xmath75 denote the individual changes caused by the horizontal , the vertical process , respectively .    in general",
    ", these effects do not appear isolated but a combination @xmath76 of both will occur at a single collision .",
    "the value @xmath75 at a single collision can be calculated exactly  @xcite .",
    "the changes @xmath77 increase monotonically with the driving amplitude @xmath2 .",
    "additionally , @xmath78 depends monotonically on the driving frequency @xmath79 .",
    "it is important to note that collisions occurring during the expansion / contraction period of the ellipse always lead to @xmath80/@xmath81 , whereas such a clear distinction is not possible for @xmath82 .    for a single particle undergoing many scattering processes , the effective change @xmath83 after a certain time depends on the sequence of these processes , hence @xmath84 after @xmath37 collisions . when regarding an ensemble of particles , the effective changes @xmath85 ( where the index @xmath86 indicates the @xmath86th particle ) after @xmath37 collisions can vary significantly from particle to particle , since the sequence of the individual @xmath87 will vary substantially for different initial conditions which is due to the nonlinear dynamics of the underlying discrete mapping .    with the just presented considerations",
    ", we can explain qualitatively the observed escape rates and especially the disappearance of the saturation value .",
    "let us focus first on the hve .",
    "the initial fast decay ( @xmath88 ) is due to the rotator orbits that are connected with the hole ( in the pss ) and escape very rapidly .",
    "the long - time decay ( @xmath89 ) is caused by particles starting on librator orbits that have been scattered through horizontal and vertical processes across the separatrix .",
    "the closer a particles initial orbit lies near the elliptic fixed points ( of the static billiard ) , the longer it takes until the effective change @xmath73 is large enough to reach the separatrix ( @xmath90 ) , see fig .  [",
    "fig : esdcsl_dv ] .",
    "the monotonic dependence of the @xmath87 on @xmath2 explains the increasing emission rate @xmath91 with increasing @xmath2 , since at a given time @xmath92 , the number of particles that can participate in the decay is larger for larger values of @xmath2 .",
    "the decay in the transient region ( @xmath93 ) is caused by a superposition of the tail of the initial fast exponential decay and the onset of the slow algebraic decay . with the same arguments , the decay of the i",
    "ve can be explained qualitatively . since @xmath94 ,",
    "the resulting changes @xmath73 are much larger for the case of the i ve compared to the ones of the hve .",
    "this leads to a very early onset of the slow algebraic decay and consequently the transient region is broadened .",
    "the above presented considerations are confirmed by the results shown in the right inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : esdcsl_dv ] , where exemplarily the average escape time and the standard deviation @xmath95 of the i ve ( @xmath96 ) as a function of the initial pam @xmath97 are plotted .",
    "particles with values of @xmath97 between zero and one ( rotators ) have approximately the same average escape times @xmath98 , but the large ( compared to @xmath98 ) standard deviation @xmath95 indicates that the individual escape times can vary significantly from particle to particle .",
    "the average escape time of particles starting on librator orbits ( @xmath99 ) increases with decreasing @xmath97 , since the required @xmath83 to change a librator into a rotator becomes larger and more and more collisions are necessary to reach these values of @xmath100 .    in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : escsl_hv ] , a modulation of the escape rate with period @xmath101 can be seen , being exactly the period of the applied driving law  ( [ eq : ellboundary ] ) .",
    "specifically , for @xmath102 , where all particles starting on rotator orbits have already escaped , @xmath103 during approximately @xmath104 ( empirically observed ) of one period and subsequently @xmath105 during a time interval @xmath106 only .",
    "from this behavior it is evident that the ellipse operates from a certain time on as a pulsed source of particles .",
    "these repeated intervals are centered around points @xmath107 of maximal extension of the ellipse , @xmath108 during the expansion period , dominantly vertical but also horizontal processes turn librators into rotators .",
    "the moving ellipse remains for a comparatively long time period in the vicinity of the extremal configuration at @xmath107 and consequently the newly created rotators escape .",
    "therefore , the dynamics is effectively probed during these short time intervals centered around @xmath107 . during the contraction period ,",
    "the librators are stabilized via vertical processes , consequently @xmath109 during @xmath104 of a period @xmath110 .     of the velocity of the escaped ensemble ( hve , @xmath111 ) . left inset : the escape time vs. the escape velocity",
    "is plotted .",
    "right inset : average escape time of the i ve ( @xmath96 ) as a function of the initial @xmath97 . ]    an astonishing feature of the escape of the hve is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : esdcsl_dv ] , where the distribution @xmath112 of the escape velocities and the correlation of the escape time vs. the escape velocity ( left inset ) after a certain time is shown for @xmath111 .",
    "there is a strong asymmetry of @xmath113 around the initial velocity @xmath114 .",
    "particularly , particles with @xmath115 , being originally exclusively librators , possess escape velocities @xmath116 which do not show a pulsed decay and whose escape velocities are symmetrically distributed around the initial velocity .",
    "it is foreseeable that the application of different driving laws and driving modes ( e.g. area - preserving oscillations ) as well as the preparation of suitable initial ( thermal ) ensembles will further advance equally our understanding as well as the phenomenology of driven nonequilibrium systems .",
    "driven billiards serve as prototype systems in this respect ."
