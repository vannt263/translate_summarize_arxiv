    "recent optical ( ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997a , b ) and x - ray surveys ( grupe et al .  1998 ) are finding that nuclei of many nearby galaxies are active .",
    "such activities manifest themselves through continuum and emission - line properties .",
    "characterizing these properties helps us to measure the luminosity functions and evolution of different sub - types , and understanding the relationship between different types of activities , for example , between nuclear starbursts and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , and thus assist in creating unified models for active galaxies .",
    "weedman ( 1983 ) has argued that starburst events in the nuclei of galaxies would evolve rapidly into compact configurations as dynamically distinct entities .",
    "perhaps the compact configuration further collapses to form a single massive black hole generally favored as the central engine for agns ( miller 1985 ) . on the other hand , goncalves , veron - cetty & veron ( 1999 ) suggest that perhaps it is nuclear activity that triggers circumnuclear star - formation .",
    "however , evidence for either case is fragmented at present . in this connection , it is very important to study agns in starburst and poststarburst galaxies . in this paper , we report new x - ray and optical observations of a poststarburst galaxy kug  1259 + 280 .    the galaxy , known as kug  1259 + 280 ( takase & miyauchi - isobe 1985 ) , is a poststarburst galaxy that appears to be in a small group of 4 galaxies within an arcmin , and is a member of the coma cluster , where it is known variously as d-61 ( dressler 1980 ) or gmp  1681 ( godwin , metcalfe , & peach 1983 ) .",
    "kug  1259 + 280 is the brightest among these 4 galaxies ( takase & miyauchi - isobe 1985 ) with @xmath7 and has a heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath8 ( caldwell & rose 1997 )",
    ". from ground - based imaging , kug  1259 + 280 has been classified as an so galaxy .",
    "however , the high resolution images of kug  1259 + 280 taken with the _ hubble space telescope _ have revealed this galaxy to be an edge - on disk galaxy with a very bright unresolved nucleus ( caldwell , rose , & dendy 1999 , hereafter crd ) .",
    "two radial dust lanes in kug  1259 + 280 , to the east of the centre and about @xmath9 away , have also been reported by crd .",
    "an unusual bulge that is boxy or peanut - shaped and , additionally , has an x morphology has been found by crd .",
    "they also report that the central ( @xmath10 or 74  pc for @xmath11 ) luminosity of kug  1259 + 280 is @xmath12 ( crd ) which is higher than any of the star clusters found in the merging galaxies studied by whitmore et al .",
    "( 1997 ) or by carlson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and is also higher than the luminosity of nuclear star clusters found in normal early - type galaxies studied by lauer et al .",
    "the nucleus is about 0.2 mag bluer than that of the surrounding bulge ( crd ) . in their spectroscopic study of galaxies in the coma cluster ,",
    "crd have found that kug  1259 + 280 is a very strong poststarburst galaxy with poststarburst age of @xmath13 which is shorter than the typical value of 1 gyr for similar galaxies in coma , thus indicating that the starburst in this galaxy had happened more recently as compared to other such galaxies in coma .",
    "based on the ratio of flux of [ n ii]@xmath14 and h@xmath15 , crd have concluded that the emission line spectrum of kug  1259 + 280 to be arising due to liner - like nuclear activity .",
    "[ cols= \" < \" , ]     @xmath16none of the emission lines have been spectroscopically resolved .",
    "[ o iii]@xmath17 is blended with fe ii @xmath18 .",
    "the instrumental resolution ( fwhm ) is about @xmath19 .",
    "recent optical spectroscopic surveys have been finding a large fraction ( @xmath243% ) of active galactic nuclei among nearby galaxies ( ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997a ) .",
    "nearly 10% of all nearby galaxies surveyed by ho et al .",
    "1997a are found to have seyfert type nuclei , the rest being liners ( low ionization nuclear emission region galaxies ) or composite liner / h ii nucleus systems .",
    "while the optical emission lines are sensitive to many physical parameters e.g. , the shape and strength of ionizing continuum arising from nucleus , temperature , density , composition and velocities of line emitting clouds surrounding the nucleus , and dust in the ambient medium , x - rays probe the innermost regions of agns .",
    "therefore , x - ray emission properties are more fundamental to infer the nature of galactic nuclei .",
    "x - ray emission from kug  1259 + 280 is found to be unresolved with the @xmath0 hri observations with a resolution of @xmath20 .",
    "this suggests that the x - ray emission from kug  1259 + 280 is perhaps mostly of nuclear origin .",
    "the nuclear nature of x - ray emission is further strengthened by the observation of strong and rapid variability detected in the x - ray observations which also points to a very active nucleus  an agn inside kug  1259 + 280 .",
    "this is consistent with the point - like appearance of the central region of kug  1259 + 280 in the optical band in the @xmath21 observations with @xmath22 resolution ( crd ) . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the observed variability , x - ray and optical spectral characteristics , and broad - band multiwavelength spectra and their implications on models of agn .",
    "the rest frame intrinsic x - ray luminosity of kug  1259 + 280 is in the range of @xmath23 .",
    "this is about a factor of 10 higher than the x - ray luminosity of low ionization nuclear emission region galaxies ( liners ) studied by komossa , b@xmath24hringer , & huchra ( 1990 ) using @xmath0 .",
    "all the liners in the sample of komossa et al .",
    "( 1990 ) have @xmath25 in the energy band 0.12.4 kev . on the other hand , seyfert 1 galaxies studied by rush et al .",
    "( 1996 ) span over 4 orders of magnitude in soft x - ray luminosity , from below @xmath26 to above @xmath27 in the same energy band",
    ". thus x - ray luminosity of kug  1259 + 280 is similar to that of a low luminosity seyfert 1 galaxy .",
    "x - ray emission from kug  1259 + 280 is highly variable . on 1991",
    "june 18 x - ray emission from kug  1259 + 280 varied by a factor of @xmath1 within @xmath2 1300  s ( fig .",
    "4 ) . this variability could be due to an outburst or a flare event in the nucleus of kug  1259 + 280 .",
    "this kind of time variability is seen in several agns e.g. , the low luminosity seyfert 1 galaxies such as ngc  4051 , and narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies such as iras  13224 - 3809 vary over periods of @xmath28 ( pounds 1979 ; lawrence et al",
    ".  1985 ; boller et al .",
    "1993 ; singh 1999 ) . on the other hand , rapid variability on the time scales less than a day is generally absent in the case of liners ( ptak et al .",
    "1998 , pellegrini et al .",
    "x - ray emission from kug  1259 + 280 is also found to vary by @xmath29 within a year between rass and pspc pointed observations .",
    "the large amplitude variation of the nuclear x - ray source in a short time scale is possible only if the nucleus is very compact .",
    "simple light travel time arguments imply that nuclear x - ray source in kug  1259 + 280 is very compact ( @xmath30 ) . assuming that the soft x - ray excess emission originates from a few schwarzschild radii ( @xmath31 or more ) away from the central massive object",
    ", the mass of the central compact object is expected to be @xmath32",
    ". a lower limit of the mass of the central object can be obtained from the eddington luminosity .",
    "since kug  1259 + 280 is an ultra - soft x - ray source , it will be reasonable to assume that bulk of the luminosity for the nuclear source in kug  1259 + 280 is in the soft x - ray band .",
    "assuming that the eddington luminosity is about a factor of 5 larger than the soft x - ray luminosity in the energy band of @xmath33 , the mass of the central object is inferred to be at least @xmath34 .",
    "thus the mass of the central compact object is in the range of @xmath35 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of @xmath36 , small amplitude long term variation , and large amplitude ( by a factor of @xmath37 ) short term variation all indicate that the galaxy harbours an active nucleus .",
    "the x - ray spectra of kug  1259 + 280 obtained from three @xmath0 pspc observations are very steep ( table 4 ) .",
    "a joint - fit has revealed that all three pspc spectra are well represented by a single power - law of @xmath3 , with an _ excess _ of @xmath38 over the galactic value .",
    "this suggests the presence of an excess absorption above the galactic value during all the three observations .",
    "such an absorber is seen convincingly in the observation on 1991 june 18 .",
    "it is possible that a change in the absorbing column density local to kug  1259 + 280 could have occurred within @xmath39 as indicated by the individual power - law fits to the pspc spectra , indicating the presence of moving clouds close to the central nuclear source .",
    "the physical state ( warm or cold ) of the absorbing medium is unclear from the present data . however , in the spectrum of 1991 june 18 , there is an indication of an absorption edge at about 0.8  kev ( see residuals in fig .",
    "5 ) , which is very close to o vii and o viii edges at 0.74 and 0.87 kev commonly seen in @xmath40 and @xmath0 spectra of agns ( reynolds 1997 ) .",
    "but because of the poor signal - to - noise ratio of the data and due to the poor energy resolution of the @xmath0 pspc , it is not possible to fit an absorption edge .",
    "higher signal - to - noise data with better energy resolution will be required to confirm the presence of an absorption edge .",
    "the short time scale of @xmath39 for the change in local also implies that the nuclear x - ray source is very compact , similar to those found in agns .      optical spectrum of nuclear region of kug  1259 + 280 is not typical of either the spectra of normal galaxies or agns . in the optical spectrum of kug  1259 + 280 ,",
    "balmer emission lines are absent , instead , h@xmath41 , h@xmath42 , and h@xmath43 absorption lines are seen .",
    "h@xmath15 absorption appears to be almost balanced by emission as was also pointed out by crd .",
    "caldwell & rose ( 1997 ) have shown that kug  1259 + 280 is a very strong poststarburst galaxy in the coma cluster , based on the presence of enhanced balmer absorption lines , h@xmath43 , h@xmath42 , etc . and weaker ca",
    "ii k line compared to those in normal galaxies .",
    "crd have pointed out that the weak emission line spectrum of kug  1259 + 280 is due to nuclear activity and not due to residual star formation . from the equivalent widths of higher order balmer absorption lines in the spectrum of kug  1259 ,",
    "crd have estimated the underlying h@xmath15 absorption to be @xmath44 and found the ratio of [ n ii]@xmath14 to h@xmath15 emission to be slightly greater than 1 , which is typical value of liner emission line spectra .",
    "it is , however , well known that liner , seyfert galaxy , and h ii region spectra can not be unambiguously distinguished from one another on the basis of any single intensity ratio from any pair of lines .",
    "the various types of objects with superficially similar emission line spectra can be distinguished by using a diagnostic diagram based on pairs of emission line intensity ratios ( baldwin , phillips , & terlevich 1981 ) . in the case of kug  1259 + 280 ,",
    "weak balmer emission lines arising from the centre are dominated by the enhanced absorption lines arising from young stellar populations .",
    "assuming case b recombination ( e.g. osterbrock 1989 ) , we estimate the h@xmath41 emission flux to be @xmath45 from the equivalent width of h@xmath15 emission line estimated by crd .",
    "hence the ratio of [ o iii]@xmath46 to h@xmath41 emission is about 2 for kug  1259 + 280 .",
    "ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997b have defined liner nuclei to be those with @xmath47\\lambda5007}{h\\beta}<3.0 $ ] , and @xmath48\\lambda 6583}{h\\alpha } \\ge 0.6 $ ] .",
    "based on this definition , the estimated pair of line intensity ratios , @xmath47\\lambda5007}{h\\beta}\\sim2 $ ] and @xmath48\\lambda6583}{h\\alpha}\\sim 0.8 $ ] , suggest that nucleus of kug  1259 + 280 is , most likely , of liner type .",
    "this confirms the conclusion by crd .",
    "however , it should be noted that liners show the presence of strong [ o i]@xmath49 forbidden line in their spectra , but this line is not detected in the spectrum of kug  1259 + 280 .",
    "also , in the spectrum of kug  1259 + 280 , the forbidden line [ o iii]@xmath17 is blended with fe ii @xmath50 .",
    "the fe ii lines are seen in the spectra of seyfert galaxies and not in the spectra of liners . these raise question regarding the liner nature of kug  1259 + 280 .",
    "the lack of balmer emission lines in the spectrum of kug  1259 + 280 can be attributed to the poststarburst phenomena .",
    "to investigate quantitatively the origin of optical emission and absorption lines , higher signal - to - noise and higher resolution optical spectrum as well as uv spectrum is required .",
    "it is well known that the steep spectrum agns generally show optical spectra similar to those of optically identified nls1 galaxies ( boller , brandt & fink 1996 ) . in view of the steep x - ray spectrum of kug  1259 + 280 ,",
    "if we assume that the intrinsic nuclear optical spectrum is similar to those of nls1 galaxies modified by enhanced stellar absorption , then one would expect that the optical spectrum parameters , which are not affected significantly by the stellar absorption , should be similar to those of nls1 galaxies .",
    "the interesting parameters are the ratio of x - ray to [ o iii ] luminosity , @xmath51}$ ] , and slope ( @xmath52 ) of the optical spectrum ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "grupe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and grupe et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have studied soft x - ray and optical properties of 76 steep x - ray spectrum agns in detail . based on their measurements ,",
    "we have calculated @xmath51}$ ] for 71 agns and found that the ratio , @xmath51}$ ] , spans a large range ( 63157 ) with a median value of 399.2 .",
    "( we have excluded the two objects rxj0136 - 35 and a seyfert 2 galaxy , ic  3599 , with @xmath51}>15000 $ ] from our analysis .",
    "there are only 8 objects with @xmath51}>2000 $ ] , and only 2 with @xmath51}>3200 $ ] ) . for kug  1259 + 280 ,",
    "@xmath51}=156 $ ] .",
    "thus the ratio , @xmath51}$ ] , for kug  1259 + 280 is not different from those of steep spectrum x - ray agns . since the optical continuum emission of the nucleus of kug  1259 + 280",
    "is contaminated by the stellar emission as can be seen by the presence of strong absorption lines , we have not compared the slope of the observed optical spectrum to those of nls1 from grupe et al .",
    "the [ o iii]@xmath46 luminosity of kug  1259 + 280 is @xmath54 , which is about a factor of about 90 smaller than the mean [ o iii]@xmath46 luminosity of the 3 nls1s ( ms  2340 - 15 , rx  j0439 - 45 , and rx  j2144 - 39 ) of grupe et al .",
    "having similar soft x - ray slopes as for the kug  1259 .",
    "this could be due to a dilution of x - ray emission in kug  1259 + 280 , as the soft x - ray luminosity of kug  1259 + 280 is smaller by a factor of @xmath55 than the average soft x - ray luminosity of the 3 agn in the sample of grupe et al .",
    "the difference in the ratio of [ o iii]@xmath46 to soft x - ray luminosity between kug  1259 + 280 and the 3 agns with similar soft x - rays slopes could be either due to the contribution of [ o iii ] luminosity by h ii regions due to hot stars or due to differences in the physical parameters of the line emitting clouds , or differences in the shape of the primary radiation in the uv - euv region .",
    "based on the above comparison , it is likely that kug  1259 + 280 is a low luminosity version of nls1 galaxies , where due to the diluted power - law continuum , the optical emission lines are weak .",
    "furthermore , the weak permitted lines are heavily modified by the enhanced stellar absorption in the poststarburst region .      in figure 8",
    ", we have plotted far - infrared , optical and soft x - ray flux of kug  1259 + 280 obtained from various observations .",
    "no far - infrared measurements have been reported from kug  1259 + 280 in the iras _ point source catalogue _ ( joint iras working group 1985 ) .",
    "the iras satellite had , however , scanned the sky containing kug  1259 + 280 during the surveys .",
    "we have obtained the iras flux after co - adding the available scan data .",
    "the iras data were processed using the facilities of ipac .",
    "the measured iras flux densities are @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 at @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "no radio emission is detected within @xmath64 of kug  1259 + 280 in the nrao / vla and first sky surveys .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of kug  1259 + 280 is contaminated by stellar emission in the optical region , otherwise it is similar in shape with those of narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies reported by grupe et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and indicates a probable shift in the position of the big blue bump , although not covered in any observation , towards higher energies .",
    "as noted earlier , kug  1259 + 280 is a nuclear poststarburst galaxy with a poststarburst age of @xmath65 ( crd ) . to build a central massive object of mass @xmath66 within kug  1259 + 280 after the starburst event",
    ", the required average mass accretion rate would be only about @xmath67 . on the other hand ,",
    "the eddington accretion rate for efficiency factor @xmath68 , and @xmath69 is @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the required mass accretion rate to build a central massive object of mass @xmath71 within kug  1259 + 280 is about a factor of 10 less than the eddington accretion rate .",
    "thus it can not be ruled out that the birth of the agn in kug  1259 + 280 took place after or during the starburst event .",
    "in such a scenario , the mass accretion rate onto the young agn can be expected to be high as the fuel available would be enormous .",
    "it should be noted that some authors ( e.g. brandt & boller 1998 ) have argued that a high mass accretion rate onto a low - mass ( @xmath72 ) black hole can result in agns with steep soft x - ray spectrum .",
    "\\(i ) x - ray emission from kug  1259 + 280 is found to be unresolved by @xmath0 hri observations suggesting a point - like nuclear x - ray source in it .",
    "\\(ii ) x - ray luminosity of kug  1259 + 280 is estimated to be @xmath4 which is similar to that of low luminosity seyfert nuclei .",
    "\\(iii ) variability by a factor of @xmath37 within @xmath73 is detected in x - ray emission from kug  1259 + 280 .",
    "short time scale of variability strongly suggests an agn in the galaxy .",
    "\\(iv ) the mass of the central massive object in kug  1259 + 280 has been estimated to be in the range @xmath5 .",
    "\\(v ) x - ray spectrum of kug  1259 + 280 is found to be very steep ( @xmath3 ) in the @xmath0 band 0.12.4 kev .",
    "individual power - law model fits to 3 pspc spectra indicate a change in intrinsic absorbing column within about a day , while a joint - fit of three pspc spectra indicates excess absorption ( total @xmath74 ) over the galactic value ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "\\(vi ) the observed optical spectrum of the nuclear region of kug  1259 + 280 is markedly different from that of any class of agns .",
    "the observed spectrum could be understood if the nlr / blr emission line spectrum has been substantially modified by enhanced stellar absorption lines .",
    "estimated absorption - free balmer line strengths and observed forbidden line strengths point towards liner nature of kug  1259 + 280 . however , the nature of x - ray emission points towards nls1 nature of this galaxy .",
    "presence of fe ii lines supports this picture .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of an active nucleus in a poststarburst galaxy , kug 1259 + 280 , based on its x - ray and optical characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray source in kug 1259 + 280 was detected during a search for ultra - soft sources in the rosat pointings . </S>",
    "<S> high resolution x - ray imaging observations with @xmath0 hri show that x - ray emission from kug  1259 + 280 is unresolved . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray emission from kug  1259 + 280 is highly variable , an episode in which x - ray intensity changed by a factor @xmath1 within @xmath2 1300  s has been detected . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 pspc spectra of this galaxy is found to be well represented by a steep power - law of photon index , @xmath3 , and a change in the absorbing column within @xmath2 1  d is indicated . </S>",
    "<S> the rest frame intrinsic x - ray luminosity of kug  1259 + 280 is found to be @xmath4 similar to that of low luminosity seyfert galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> mass of the central massive object within kug  1259 + 280 is estimated to be in the range @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> optical spectrum of the nuclear region of the galaxy is complex and shows balmer absorption and collisionally excited lines of [ o iii ] , and [ n ii ] . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of forbidden emission lines and the absence of balmer emission lines in spectrum of kug  1259 + 280 could be due to photoionization by a diluted power - law continuum modified by enhanced stellar absorption due to a poststarburst event . </S>",
    "<S> estimated balmer line strengths free of stellar absorptions and forbidden line strengths indicate the nucleus of kug  1259 + 280 to be liner - like in nature . however , the low - ionization forbidden line [ o i]@xmath66300 usually present in liner spectra , is not detected in the spectrum of kug  1259 + 280 . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray characteristics  variability , point - like appearance , luminosity and steepness of spectrum indicate that nucleus in kug  1259 + 280 is active and perhaps like that of narrow - line seyfert type 1 galaxies .    </S>",
