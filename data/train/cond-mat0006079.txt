    "the antiferromagnetic state of the half - filled hubbard model with nearest - neighbour ( nn ) hopping is characterized by an energy gap , and the spectrum of transverse spin fluctuations consists of the low - lying , collective ( magnon ) excitations , as well as the single - particle excitations across the gap .",
    "generally , there is a clear distinction between these two excitations which are well separated in energy .",
    "however , recent extensions , e.g. with disorder,@xcite impurities,@xcite and next - nearest - neighbour ( nnn ) hopping,@xcite clearly show the existence of essentially gapless antiferromagnetism , arising from a variety of mechanisms .",
    "thus , with increasing disorder ( on - site potential disorder ) the two hubbard bands progressively broaden , until the band gap vanishes when the disorder strength @xmath5 . with low-@xmath0 impurities on the other hand ,",
    "the effective charge gap becomes negligible due to nearly localized states on the impurities.@xcite and lastly , when nnn hopping is included , a band asymmetry is introduced which reduces the band gap in the af state , and in weak coupling there exists a region of gapless af phase in the magnetic phase diagram.@xcite    this gaplessness implies that the collective magnon excitations are no longer well defined , and actually merge with the single - particle excitations , thereby necessitating a unified scheme for the evaluation of transverse spin fluctuation .",
    "while the magnon contribution to the transverse spin fluctuations was evaluated recently , and the sublattice magnetization and the nel temperature were obtained within a renormalized spin fluctuation theory in the whole @xmath6 range,@xcite in this paper we describe an alternate scheme for evaluating the transverse spin fluctuations which allows both the collective excitations and the single - particle excitations to be studied on the same footing .",
    "single - particle excitations are especially significant because it is precisely this part of the transverse spin spectral function which allows for a quantitative distinction of the antiferromagnetic state within the hubbard model from that of an equivalent heisenberg spin model with @xmath0-dependent , extended - range spin couplings @xmath7 , but possessing only magnon excitations .",
    "a study of the relative strengths of the magnon and single - particle excitations , in terms of the integrated spectral weights in the whole @xmath6 range , will therefore allow for a quantitative demarkation along the @xmath6 axis below which single - particle excitations are the dominant contribution .",
    "thus , while in this low-@xmath0 regime the af state is not well described in terms of an effective heisenberg spin model possessing only magnon excitations , in the intermediate and strong coupling limits use of an effective heisenberg model with @xmath0-dependent spin couplings @xmath7,@xcite and generally use of a spin picture@xcite is appropriate .",
    "yet another significance of the single - particle excitations is interestingly connected with the spin commutation relation @xmath8=2s^z$ ] .",
    "the rpa - level ground - state expectation value @xmath9\\rangle_{\\rm rpa}$ ] , involving the difference of transverse spin correlations evaluated in the af ground state , should be identically equal to @xmath10 , the local magnetization at the hf level .",
    "this is deduced from the fact that both rpa and hf approximations are of the same order ( o(1 ) ) within the systematic inverse - degeneracy expansion scheme@xcite in powers of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the number of orbitals per site .",
    "therefore both rpa and hf become exact in the limit @xmath13 , when all corrections of order @xmath11 or higher vanish .",
    "the magnon contribution @xmath9 \\rangle_{\\rm rpa } ^{\\rm magnon}$ ] was indeed found to be in excellent agreement with the hf magnetization @xmath10 in the intermediate and strong coupling limits.@xcite however , a discrepancy was observed at small @xmath0 which was attributed to the neglect of the single - particle excitations , which become relatively more important in the weak coupling limit .",
    "we will show here that indeed when the single - particle excitations are included this discrepancy is exactly removed .    finally , the unified scheme for incorporating both the single particle and collective excitations in the evaluation yields the complete spectrum of transverse spin excitations in the magnetic state .",
    "calculations with realistic models of magnetic solids can hence be used for comparison with results of scattering studies with neutrons , which are direct experimental probes into the spectrum of magnetic excitations in solids . in this",
    "regard the necessity of more realistic models which include nnn hopping etc . has been acknowledged recently from realistic band structure studies , photoemission data and neutron - scattering measurements of high - t@xmath14 and related materials.@xcite",
    "we consider the following hamiltonian on a square lattice , with hopping terms @xmath15 and @xmath3 between nearest - neighbour ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbour ( nnn ) pairs of sites @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively , @xmath18 extension to the simple cubic lattice is considered in the appendix . in the plane - wave basis defined by @xmath19 , the non - interacting part of the hamiltonian @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the two free - particle energies , correponding to nn and nnn hopping respectively , @xmath23    for the nn model , the hf - level description of the broken - symmetry af state , and the transverse spin fluctuations have been discussed earlier in the strong,@xcite intermediate,@xcite and weak coupling@xcite limits .",
    "we briefly discuss the extension for the nnn hopping .",
    "since the nnn hopping term connects sites in the same sublattice , in the two - sublattice basis the @xmath22 term appears in the diagonal matrix elements of the hf hamiltonian @xmath24 = \\epsilon'_{\\bf k } \\ ; { \\bf 1 } +   \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } -\\sigma \\delta & \\epsilon_{\\bf k }   \\\\ \\epsilon_{\\bf k } & \\sigma \\delta   \\end{array } \\right ] \\ ] ] for spin @xmath25 .",
    "here @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the sublattice magnetization . for the nn hopping model @xmath28 is also the energy gap for single - particle excitations .",
    "since the @xmath29 term appears as a unit matrix , the eigenvectors of the hf hamiltonian remain unchanged from the nn case,@xcite whereas the eigenvalues correponding to the quasiparticle energies are modified to , @xmath30 the two signs @xmath31 refer to the two quasiparticle bands .",
    "the band gap is thus affected by the nnn hopping term , and it progressively decreases as @xmath32 in the weak coupling limit .    as the eigenvectors of the hf hamiltonian are unchanged , the self - consistency condition retains its form , and therefore the sublattice magnetization is independent of @xmath3 , provided there is a nonzero band gap , with the lower band occupied and the upper band empty .",
    "we will restrict ourselves only to this regime where there is no band overlap , though the gap may vanish when the two bands are just touching .",
    "the fermionic quasiparticle amplitudes @xmath33 and @xmath34 for spin @xmath35 and the two quasiparticle bands are given by @xmath36 these relationships follow from the spin - sublattice and particle - hole symmetry in the af state of the half - filled system",
    ".    however , this situation changes when with increasing nnn hopping @xmath3 the two bands overlap and the band gap vanishes .",
    "this overlap indicates that the low - lying states in the upper band corresponding to double occupancy are lower in energy than the high - energy states in the lower band .",
    "this results in charge transfer and consequently partially empty and doubly occupied sites .",
    "the situation is therefore analogous to the addition of holes or electrons in the half - filled hubbard model , with all its associated complications of spin bags , strings of upturned spins , spiral and striped phases etc.@xcite thus the simple gapless af state of the nnn hopping model,@xcite which is indeed a self - consistent hf solution , may actually be unstable due to same instabilities as the hole - doped af .",
    "numerical hf studies do show this instability , and will be further discussed elsewhere.@xcite",

    ", there are two sources of contribution to the spectral function , @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "the contribution arising from the imaginary part of @xmath43 is associated with the single - particle excitations across the gap ( with @xmath45 for the nn model ) , whereas that due to the vanishing of the denominator @xmath46 is associated with the collective magnon excitations ( involving @xmath47 for the nn model ) .",

    "<S> the spectral function of transverse spin fluctuations , including the contributions from both the single - particle and the collective ( magnon ) excitations in an antiferromagnet , is evaluated for the hubbard model with nn and nnn hoppings in the full @xmath0-range from weak coupling to strong coupling . for the nn hopping model , the magnon excitations are dominant for @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , so that an effective spin description of the af state holds down to a surprisingly low @xmath0 value . in the weak coupling limit </S>",
    "<S> the spectral function is suppressed at low energies , as if due to an effective gap . </S>",
    "<S> nnn hopping @xmath3 leads to magnon softening and also a significant increase in the low - energy spectral function due to single - particle excitations . </S>",
    "<S> evolution of the magnon spectrum with @xmath3 is studied in the strong coupling limit , and the quantum spin - fluctuation correction to sublattice magnetization in @xmath2 and the nel temperature in @xmath4 are also evaluated .    2 </S>"
