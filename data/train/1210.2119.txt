    "entanglement is a fundamental physical resource in quantum information and computation  @xcite .",
    "once two remote parties , say alice and bob , share a suitable amount of entanglement , they can implement a variety of powerful protocols , including teleportation of quantum states  @xcite and quantum gates  @xcite , and the distribution of unconditionally secure keys  @xcite .",
    "the problem of entanglement distribution is therefore a central topic of investigation in the quantum information community .",
    "unfortunately , this distribution is also fragile : quantum systems inevitably interact with the external environment whose decoherent action typically degrades their entanglement . in realistic implementations where the effect of decoherence is non - negligible , entanglement distribution may become challenging and may need distillation protocols  @xcite , where a large number of weakly - entangled states are converted into fewer but more entangled states .",
    "the worst case scenario is when decoherence is so strong as to destroy any input entanglement .",
    "mathematically , this is represented by the concept of entanglement - breaking channel  @xcite . in general , a quantum channel @xmath0  is entanglement - breaking when its local action on one part of a bipartite state always results into a separable output state , no matter what the initial state were . in other words ,",
    "given two systems , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , in an arbitrary bipartite state @xmath3 , the output state @xmath4  is always separable , where @xmath5 is the identity channel applied to system @xmath1 and @xmath6 is the entanglement - breaking channel applied to system @xmath2 .    despite entanglement - breaking channels having been the subject of an intensive study by the community",
    ", they have only been analyzed under markovian conditions of no memory .",
    "in other words , when the distribution involves two or more systems , these systems are typically assumed to be perturbed in an independent fashion , each of them subject to the same memoryless channel .",
    "for instance , consider the symmetric scheme in fig .",
    "[ scenario ] , where a middle station ( charlie ) has a bipartite system @xmath7 in some entangled state , but its communication lines with two remote parties ( alice and bob ) are affected by entanglement - breaking channels @xmath8 and @xmath6 .     and @xmath2 .",
    "the communication lines with alice and bob are affected by two independent entanglement - breaking channels , @xmath8 and @xmath6 . in this environment , no entanglement can be distributed , neither via single transmission ( charlie @xmath9 alice or bob ) , nor via double ( charlie @xmath9 alice and bob).,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    under the assumption of memoryless channels , there is clearly no way to distribute entanglement among any of the parties .",
    "suppose that charlie tries to share entanglement with one of the remote parties by sending one of the two systems while keeping the other ( a scenario that we call 1-system transmission  or just single transmission ) . for instance , charlie may keep system @xmath1 while transmitting system @xmath2 to bob .",
    "the action of @xmath10 destroys the initial entanglement , so that systems @xmath1 ( kept ) and @xmath11 ( transmitted ) are separable .",
    "symmetrically , the action of @xmath12 destroys the entanglement between system @xmath13 ( transmitted ) and system @xmath2 ( kept ) .",
    "now suppose that charlie sends system @xmath1 to alice and system @xmath2 to bob ( a scenario that we call 2-system transmission  or double transmission ) .",
    "since the joint action of the two  channels is given by the tensor product @xmath14 quantum entanglement must necessarily be destroyed . in other words , since we have 1-system entanglement - breaking , then we must have 2-system entanglement - breaking .    in this paper",
    "we discuss how the previous implication is false when we introduce correlations , i.e. , a memory , between the two entanglement - breaking channels . in the presence of a correlated - noise environment",
    ", the double transmission can successfully distribute entanglement despite the single transmission being subject to entanglement - breaking : charlie can transmit entanglement to alice and bob , despite not being able to share any entanglement with them .",
    "surprisingly , this effect can be induced by the presence of separable correlations in the joint environment , so that the broken entanglement is restored in a subtle way and it is not just replaced by other entanglement coming from the environment . in other words , to achieve this effect we do not need to consider arbitrary joint dilations of the two channels , but just two independent unitary dilations which are coupled by a separable environmental state .     and",

    "this reactivation of entanglement distribution is induced by the separable correlations injected from the environment . for twirling environments ( in any dimension ) , the separable state @xmath21 is also classical ( zero - discord ) , so that entanglement reactivation is mediated by purely - classical correlations.,scaledwidth=62.0% ]    to better clarify these points , consider fig .",
    "[ scenario2 ] . in the left panel , the two memoryless entanglement - breaking channels , @xmath8 and @xmath6 ,",

    "one could consider a completely general joint unitary @xmath27 involving both the input systems , together with ancillary systems @xmath28 however this general approach is not interesting and somehow trivial , since it always includes cases where the input entanglement is broken ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 both separable ) and replaced by fresh entanglement coming from the environment ( so that @xmath31 is entangled ) .",
    "more interestingly , our analysis regards more realistic scenarios where the environment has minimal resources , i.e. , it is weakly correlated , therefore far from being entangled .",
    "this is interesting for its potential applications to realistic non - markovian systems , and theoretically non - trivial , since no swapping of entanglement can occur between systems and environment . in other words",
    ", we are interested in studying the weakest models of correlated - noise environment , close to the memoryless paradigm , which are able to reactivate the entanglement distribution .",
    "driven by such a goal , the simplest and cheapest way to combine two entanglement breaking channels and create a weakly - correlated joint environment , is to keep the previous independent unitaries , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and replace the environmental product - state @xmath32 with a separable state @xmath20 having the same marginals @xmath33 and @xmath34 , but correlated @xmath35 ( see the right panel of fig .  [ scenario2 ] ) . assuming this minimal dilation , we create a joint channel @xmath36 , transforming the input state @xmath3 as@xmath37~,\\label{eqdil}%\\ ] ] where @xmath38 .",
    "clearly , the joint channel is not memoryless @xmath39 .",
    "also note that the two local channels , @xmath8 and @xmath6 , are still well defined .",
    "for instance , if only system @xmath1 is transmitted , we have@xmath40.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in our work we show that , despite @xmath8 and @xmath6 being entanglement - breaking ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 separable for any input @xmath3 ) , the joint channel @xmath0 is able to transmit entanglement , in the sense that @xmath31 can be entangled for a suitable choice of the input entangled state @xmath3 .",
    "this entanglement reactivation is clearly an effect of the injected correlations , coming from the separable state of the environment @xmath21 . as mentioned earlier , the interesting point is thar the distribution is restored as an effect of weak , local - type correlations .",
    "the reactivation of entanglement occurs in different kinds of separable environments , with rather different physical properties .",
    "the simplest environments to construct are the twirling environments , which are based on the twirling operators @xmath41 ( or @xmath42 ) . in this case , a random unitary @xmath43 is directly applied to system @xmath1 and the same unitary ( or its conjugate ) is correspondingly applied to system @xmath2 . while the local action of a random unitary ( @xmath44 or @xmath45 ) is entanglement - breaking , the correlated action ( @xmath41 ) perfectly preserves specific classes of entangled states , belonging to an invariant decoherent - free subspace of the joint correlated environment  @xcite .",
    "since these environments  are based on local operations and classical communication ( locc ) , they are expected to introduce correlations which are separable and , more precisely , purely - classical .",
    "this feature can be explicitly checked by performing the unitary dilation of these environments according to eq .",
    "( [ eqdil ] ) , and checking that the environmental state @xmath20 is a classical state , therefore , with zero quantum discord .    twirling environments can easily be constructed for quantum systems with hilbert spaces of any dimension , both finite ( qudits ) and infinite ( continuous - variable systems  @xcite ) . in the case of two qudits",
    ", the randomization of the twirling operators @xmath41 ( or @xmath46 ) is performed over the entire unitary group . in this case , it is easy to identify states which are invariant under @xmath41-twirling ( werner states  @xcite ) and @xmath42-twirling ( isotropic states  @xcite ) . in the specific case of qubits ( @xmath47 ) , we can restrict the randomization to the basis of the pauli operators , with the qubit werner state being invariant under pauli twirling .",
    "things are less trivial for infinite dimension , in particular , for bosonic modes  @xcite . in this case , we restrict the twirling operators to the compact group of orthogonal symplectic transformations , i.e. , phase - space rotations .",
    "the bosonic twirling environment so defined is non - gaussian . here",
    ", it is interesting to see that , only for the @xmath42-twirling , we can identify gaussian states which are invariant and entangled : these are the two mode squeezed vacuum states , also known as einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) states  @xcite . more generally , this class can be extended to continuous variable werner states , which are non - gaussian states given by mixing an epr state with a tensor product of thermal states  @xcite .",
    "thanks to the existence of an invariant subspace of entangled states , twirling channels allow for the perfect distribution of entanglement in the two - system transmission , despite being one - system entanglement - breaking . however , the presence of such a subspace is not necessary if we relax the condition of perfect transmission and we accept that only a fraction of the input entanglement survives the two - system transmission .",
    "remarkably , this is possible for bosonic systems evolving in a realistic model of correlated - noise gaussian environment , which is the direct generalization of the standard thermal - lossy environment .    our model of gaussian environment can be represented by two beam - splitters ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) whose environmental ports are subject to a correlated ( separable ) two - mode thermal state @xmath20",
    ". such an environment does not have decoherence - free subspaces , apart from the trivial invariant space given by its own thermal state @xmath20 .",
    "then , for a sufficiently large amount of entanglement at the input , charlie can distribute a distillable amount to alice and bob , despite the single quantum channels charlie - alice ( @xmath8 ) and charlie - bob ( @xmath6 ) being entanglement - breaking . in particular , we find a threshold behavior according to which remote entanglement is restored only after a critical amount of correlations has been injected by the environment .",
    "once this reactivation has taken place , we may ask if the amount of remote entanglement is then increasing in the amount of injected correlations .",
    "unfortunately such a simple monotonicity does not seem to hold in the general case .",
    "in fact , for these gaussian environments , we adopt gaussian discord as a measure of quantum correlations ( upper bound to the actual discord ) .",
    "then , we can easily evaluate the number of entanglement bits ( ebits ) which are remotely distributed in terms of the number of discordant bits ( dbits )  and classical bits ( cbits ) , which are injected by the environment .",
    "for some classes of gaussian environments , remote entanglement is proven to be increasing in the injected correlations ( both classical and quantum ) . however",
    ", this monotonic behavior is not a general property , since we can exhibit two examples of environments , with identical classical correlations and increasing gaussian discord , for which the number of ebits remotely restored is strictly decreasing . because of this non - monotonic behavior , the phenomenon of entanglement restoration in gaussian environments does not seem to be easily or directly related to a specific quantification of the correlations ( classical , quantum or total ) .    to clarify relations with previous literature",
    ", we remark that our study is specifically devoted to show the potentialities of separable correlations in breaking the mechanism of entanglement - breaking , so that an entangled state is able to keep some of the initial entanglement during the transmission towards remote parties .",
    "it is clear that this is different from what considered in previous studies  @xcite , where separable probes were used to distribute fresh entanglement  between two quantum systems that have never interacted before .",
    "this basic difference leads to completely different roles for quantum discord . while in refs .",
    "@xcite discord is identified as the fundamental physical resource needed to distribute fresh entanglement , in our study discord is not necessary in general , since purely - classical correlations can indeed be sufficient to restore broken entanglement ( e.g. , see twirling environments ) .    in terms of potential impact",
    ", our work opens new possibilities for entanglement distribution in environments with extreme decoherence , where the presence of noise correlations and memory effects can be exploited to recover from entanglement - breaking .",
    "since entanglement restoration can be achieved by separable correlations , our work also poses fundamental questions on the intimate relations between local and nonlocal correlations and , more generally , between classical and quantum correlations .",
    "it is important to note that memory channels and correlated ( in particular , non - markovian ) environments are present in a wide series of practical scenarios  @xcite , including spin chains  @xcite , atoms in optical cavities  @xcite , quantum dots in photonic crystals  @xcite , photonic propagation through linear optical systems  @xcite and atmospheric turbulence  @xcite .",

    "in this first analysis , we combine two entanglement - breaking channels to form a twirling environment , where entanglement distribution is reactivated by the presence of classical correlations .",
    "in particular , two - system transmission from charlie to alice and bob allows for a perfect transfer of entanglement , thanks to the existence of an invariant subspace of entangled states .",
    "as already said , this is proven for hilbert spaces of any dimension . in sec .",
    "[ qubitsec ] , we start by considering the transmission of qubits in the simplest examples of twirling environments ( correlated pauli environments ) . then , we consider the general case of qudits evolving in multidimensional twirling environments ( sec .  [ twirlsection ] )",
    "finally , we consider bosonic systems subject to non - gaussian twirling environments which are based on random phase - space rotations ( sec .",
    "[ bossections ] ) .",
    "the simplest example can be constructed for qubits considering the basis of the four pauli operators @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "given an arbitrary two - qubit state @xmath3 , we consider the correlated pauli channel @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are probabilities .",
    "this channel is clearly simulated by random loccs .",
    "in fact , it is equivalent to extract a random variable @xmath55 , apply the pauli unitary @xmath56  to qubit @xmath57 , communicate @xmath58 and then apply the same unitary @xmath56  to qubit @xmath2 .",
    "it is easy to check that the two - qubit channel of eq .",

    "it is easy to write the unitary dilation of the correlated pauli channel .",
    "it is sufficient to introduce an environment composed by two systems @xmath17 and @xmath18 , each being a qudit with dimension @xmath61 and orthonormal basis @xmath62 .",

    "we now show the conditions under which the correlated pauli environment is simultaneously one - qubit entanglement - breaking and two - qubit entanglement - preserving .",
    "we start by considering the transmission of one qubit only , e.g. , qubit @xmath1 .",

    "@xcite .    assuming the condition of one - qubit entanglement - breaking  ( @xmath66 ) , charlie is clearly not able to share any entanglement with alice or bob . despite this",
    ", charlie can still distribute entanglement to alice and bob .",
    "this is possible because we can identify a class of entangled states @xmath3 which are invariant under the action of the correlated map  ( [ qubitenv ] ) , i.e. , @xmath69 .",
    "this class is simply given by the werner states@xmath70 with parameter @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the maximally - mixed state and @xmath73 is the maximally - entangled ( singlet ) state .",

    "thus , if charlie sends werner states with @xmath74 , these entangled states are perfectly distributed to alice and bob ( two - qubit entanglement - preserving ) .      in this section",

    "for these systems , we can easily construct classically - correlated environments which are simultaneously 1-qudit entanglement - breaking and 2-qudit entanglement - preserving .",
    "consider two qudits , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with hilbert spaces of the same dimension @xmath78 and prepared in a bipartite state @xmath3 .",
    "a multidimensional @xmath41 twirling channel is described by the following completely - positive trace - preserving map@xmath79 where the integral is over the entire unitary group @xmath80 acting on the @xmath78-dimensional hilbert space , and @xmath81 is the haar measure .",
    "this channel is clearly realizable by random loccs : a random unitary @xmath43 is drawn and applied to qudit @xmath1 , the choice of @xmath43 is classically communicated to the other qudit @xmath2 , which is then subject to the same unitary .",
