    "as explained by the presentations of hidalgo and bernal in this conference series , the inclusion of milgrom s acceleration constant @xmath0 as a fundamental quantity in a description of gravity leads to a great deal of understanding in a wide variety of non - relativistic astrophysical systems . as such , let us assume that a point mass @xmath1 located at the origin of coordinates generates a relativistic gravitational field in the mondian regime and that a metric formalism describes the field equations .",
    "this problem is characterised by the speed of light in vacuum @xmath2 , the mass @xmath1 of the central object generating the gravitational field , newton s constant of gravity @xmath3 and milgrom s acceleration constant @xmath4 . with these parameters ,",
    "two `` fundamental lengths '' can be built :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the gravitational radius and @xmath7 is the mass - length scale as described in @xcite and by hidalgo s presentation in this conference series .",
    "when relativistic effects are taken into account for the gravitational field , then standard general relativity should be recovered in the limit @xmath8 , and a relativistic version of mond should be obtained when @xmath9 .",
    "this shows that the pursue of a complete metric description leads one to consider the scale - dependence of gravity .",
    "the length scales presented in equation   must somehow appear in a relativistic theory of gravity which includes the fundamental nature of the constant @xmath4 .",
    "for example , in the metric formalism , a generalised hilbert action @xmath10 can be written in the following way :    @xmath11    which slightly differs from its traditional form ( see e.g. @xcite ) since we have introduced the dimensionless ricci s scalar @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the standard ricci s scalar and @xmath14 defines a length fixed by the parameters of the theory .",
    "the explicit form of the length @xmath14 has to be obtained once a certain known limit of the theory is taken , usually a non - relativistic limit .",
    "in fact , since equation   defines two natural lengths of the theory it is coherent to postulate the following relation between all these lengths :    @xmath15    note that the definition of @xmath16 gives a correct dimensional character to the action  , something that is not completely clear in all previous works dealing with a metric description of the gravitational field . for @xmath17 , the standard einstein - hilbert action is obtained . using the usual form for the matter action @xmath18 , with a matter lagrangian @xmath19 ,",
    "then the null variations of the complete action @xmath20 yield the following field equations :    @xmath21    where the dimensionless ricci tensor @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the standard ricci tensor .",
    "the laplace - beltrami operator has been written as @xmath24 and the prime denotes derivative with respect to its argument .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor @xmath25 is defined through the following standard relation : @xmath26 . in here and in what follows",
    ", we choose a ( @xmath27 ) signature for the metric @xmath28 and use einstein s summation convention over repeated indices .",
    "the trace of equation   is : @xmath29    where @xmath30 .",
    "under the assumption of a power - law relation for the function @xmath31 , i.e.    @xmath32    it follows that the trace   can be approximated to order of magnitude since @xmath33 , @xmath34 and the mass density @xmath35 yielding :    @xmath36    note that the second term on the left - hand side of equation   is much greater than the first term when @xmath37 and so , since @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the gaussian curvature of space and @xmath40 its radius of curvature , then @xmath41 .",
    "this should occur in the weak - field regime , where mondian effects are expected . for a metric description of gravity",
    ", this limit must correspond to the relativistic regime of mond . in what follows",
    "we will only deal with this approximation and so , equation   takes the following form :    @xmath42    using the fact that at second order of approximation @xmath43 for a non - relativistic potential @xmath44 and an acceleration @xmath45 , it follows that    @xmath46    which converges to a mond - like acceleration regime ( i.e. @xmath47 ) if @xmath48 . at the lowest order of approximation",
    "a description of the gravitational force should not include the velocity of light and so @xmath49 . combining this result with equation",
    "then relation   means that    @xmath50    which is the traditional form of mond in spherical symmetry .    as explained by @xcite in a more rigorous form ,",
    "the result obtained in equation   is of general character , since it can be formally proved at the lowest order of perturbation for a @xmath51 metric theory of gravity far away from the mass sources , i.e. when @xmath52 , or equivalently when @xmath53 . in @xcite",
    "it is also discussed the noether symmetries of the problem and for this particular case the conserved charge of the problem is proportional to @xmath54 .",
    "the metric theory of gravity presented here is by no means a complete description at all scales of gravitation .",
    "it only deals with the mondian regime of gravity , i.e. when @xmath53 is valid . in other words ,",
    "our description breaks the scale invariance of gravity in a more general way than the one described in @xcite .",
    "the mass dependence of @xmath55 means that the mass needs to appear on hilbert s action  .",
    "this is traditionally not the case , since that action is thought to be purely a function of the geometry of space - time due to the presence of mass and energy .",
    "however , it was @xcite who first encountered this peculiarity in the hilbert action when dealing with a metric generalisation of mond and later on also discussed by  @xcite . following the remarks of @xcite",
    ", one should not be surprised if some of the commonly accepted notions , even at the fundamental level of the action , require generalisations and re - thinking .",
    "an extended metric theory of gravity goes beyond the traditional general relativity ideas and in this way , we probably need to change our standard view of its fundamental principles .    with these ideas in mind",
    "it is interesting to note that recently @xcite have proposed a modified @xmath56 theory of gravity , where @xmath57 represents the trace of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the theory developed in this article is a particular example of their proposal with the identification @xmath58 .",
    "we are developing a cosmological theory with these ideas in mind and we are also applying this full theory to gravitational lenses and to the dynamics of clusters of galaxies .",
    "the obtained results will be reported elsewhere .",
