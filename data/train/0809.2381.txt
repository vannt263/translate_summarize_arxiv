    "systems of interacting dipoles ( sids ) are atracting a renewed interest .",
    "this is in part due to recent advances in nanoscience @xcite which render available realizations of magnetic nanoparticle assemblies @xcite .",
    "these systems show a rich collective behaviour in which the dipole - dipole interactions play an essential role .",
    "this is because dipole - dipole interaction strength grows linearly with nanoparticle volume .",
    "collective effects that are controlled by dipolar interactions can therefore become important at reasonably high temperatures .",
    "spatial variations of the direction of magnetic dipolar fields lead to frustration and make sids very sensitive to their spatial arrangements @xcite . in crystalline arrangements for example , sids exhibit different long ranged ferro or antiferromagnetic dipolar magnetic order that depends crucially on lattice geometry .",
    "the magnetic ordering depends also crucially in anisotropy . on the one hand ,",
    "single site anisotropy is always present in magnetic crystals . on the other hand , dipole - dipole interactions by themselves",
    "create effective anisotropies in 2d systems . in square lattices , for example , dipole - dipole interactions pushes spins to lie on the plane of the lattice , and termal excitations tends to align them along the two principal axes of the lattice @xcite .",
    "the resulting magnetic order states that ensue from the competition of dipolar and anisotropic energies could be as exotic as `` spin ice '' found in diamond type crystals @xcite .",
    "sids in disordered spatial arrangements are also of interest .",
    "some non equilibrium spin glass behaviour ( like time dependent susceptibilities and aging ) has been observed in experiments with systems of randomly placed dipoles as frozen ferrofluids or strongly diluted magnetic crystals @xcite .",
    "very recent computer simulations indicate that systems of ising dipoles with random anisotroy axes have an equilibrium spin glass phase at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study by numerical simulations the effect of quenched directional disorder in a system of dipoles placed in cristalline array .",
    "we are interested in how the magnetic dipolar order and the character of the transition between the paramagnetic and the low temperature ordered phase vary as we increase the amount of disorder .",
    "we also investigate whether there is a well defined threshold of disorder beyond which dipolar order dissapears .     for systems with @xmath6 .",

    "we first define the system model we use .",
    "let @xmath16 be a classical two xy - component unit spin at lattice site @xmath17 of a square lattice .",
    "these spins interact as pure magnetic dipoles with hamiltonian @xmath18    where    @xmath19    @xmath20 is the displacement from site @xmath17 to site @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the square lattice parameter . in the following all energies and temperatures",
    "are given in terms of @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "when there is no quenched disorder , we consider a strong quadrupolar anisotropy that forces spins to lie along any of the two principal axis of the square lattice .",
    "this dipolar four - state clock model has been studied recently , and found to have a second order transition between a paramagnetic and an antiferromagnetic dipolar phase at @xmath25 with critical exponents @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite . in the ordered phase",
    "spins point up along lines with alternate sign from one line to the adjacent one . in order to characterize these antiferromagnetic order",
    ", we define a staggered magnetization as @xmath28 and use @xmath29 as order parameter .",
    "this system has been found to be very sensitive to the direction of the quadrupolar anisotropy axes .",
    "for example , if one turn these axes an angle @xmath30 , critical exponents change to @xmath31 and @xmath32@xcite .",
    "thus , we introduce disorder in the model described above by tilting these two orthogonal anisotropy axes by an angle @xmath0 with respect to the crystalline axes . for each spin",
    "this angle @xmath0 is chosen at random and without bias from the interval @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "note that @xmath33 correspond to a completely random distribution of the orientation of these pairs of axes .",
    "note also that even in this case anisotropies never force any pair of spins to form angles greater that @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , this is less disruptive than random _ uniaxial _ anisotropy @xcite .     for the indicated values of @xmath3 .",

    "we let a spin on site @xmath17 interact through dipolar fields with all spins within an @xmath38 square centered on the @xmath17- site @xcite .",
    "our simulations follow the standard metropolis monte carlo ( mc ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "we use a single - spin flip dynamics , in which all dipolar fields are updated throughout the system every time a spin flip is accepted , before another spin is chosen in order to repeat the process . in our mc simulations , we start for a given realization of disorder from @xmath39 ( well in the paramagnetic phase ) and lower temperature in @xmath40 steps . at each value of @xmath14",
    "we averaged over @xmath41 mc sweeps having first discarded @xmath42 mc sweeps to let the system equilibrate .",
    "finally , our results are averaged over @xmath43 different independent realizations of quenched disorder . in order to get realiable results we use at least @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 . as a result ,",
