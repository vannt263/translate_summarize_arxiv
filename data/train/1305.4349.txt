    "more than one century has passed since the discovery of quantum mechanics . during this period",
    "every aspect of its predictions - specially the most weird ones such as nonlocality , contextuality , superposition , and entanglement - has been tested thousands of times , and up to precision of measurements , so far no deviation has been found .",
    "nowadays quantum effects are not mere subjects of abstract interest for physicists , but the backbone of the @xmath2 century technology , from electronic devices to drug design . however , despite being so far the most successful theory in the history of science , principles of quantum mechanics are still considered not be well understood .    according to wikipedia",
    "there are at least 14 well known , more or less distinct , interpretations of quantum mechanics .",
    "there are also many less - known interpretations e.g.  @xcite .",
    "various tests of completeness of quantum mechanics against hidden variable hypothesis  @xcite such as einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) experiments and similar apparent paradoxes  @xcite , and what is generally called _",
    "bell s inequalities _",
    "@xcite , after the original work by j.s .",
    "bell  @xcite , are proposed and experimentally implemented .",
    "the original aim of bell s inequalities were providing a quantitative mean for testing quantum mechanics in epr gedanken experiment setup that involves entangled particles .",
    "evidently , such experiments are not anymore just thought exercises .",
    "they have been carried out in different setups , even at long distances  @xcite , and use techniques which should lead to realization of quantum computing machines .",
    "in addition , a recently proposed no - go theorem provides a mean to test hidden variables and incompleteness hypothesis with non - entangled particles  @xcite ( from here on pbr ) . the first test of contextuality using the kochen - specker theorem  @xcite , which does not need specially prepared entangled particles , conclusively confirms predictions of quantum mechanics and their deviation from classical systems  @xcite .",
    "the most remarkable and mysterious property of quantum mechanics is its nonlocality which causes the violation of bell s inequalities , the hardy s paradox  @xcite , the pbr no - go theorem , and the inherent inconsistency of quantum mechanics with classical gravity  @xcite .",
    "another controversial issue is the nature of a quantum state and whether it is a _",
    "real _ physical entity or it simply presents _ the state of information _ that an observer has about a physical system . here _ reality _ means the complete representation , i.e. no hidden observable is averaged out .",
    "this implicitly means that a state should be _ measurable _ for each instance of a system . in classical physics",
    ", the state of a system is defined by the list of values @xmath3 measured or predicted for a minimal number of observables @xmath4 that characterize the system completely , i.e. any other observable - physical property - @xmath5 accessible to an observer will be a single - valued function of these observables @xmath6 : o o [ nooverlap ] it is important to emphasize on the single valuedness because when multiple values are possible , some characterizing quantities should have been missed i.e. averaged out .",
    "classical statistical mechanics assumes that it is not possible to measure the complete set of characterizing observables @xmath7 of a system .",
    "the impact of averaging out unobservable ( hidden ) quantities is the random behaviour of accessible characteristics @xmath3 with a probability distribution @xmath8 , and exclusion relation ( [ nooverlap ] ) is not necessarily satisfied , see e.g.  @xcite , and @xmath8 presents _ the state of information _ of the observer about the system .",
    "the no - go theorem of pbr proves that in quantum mechanics the state satisfies no - overlap condition ( [ nooverlap ] ) , and if quantum mechanics is a complete description of nature , the quantum state of a system is one of its physical properties .",
    "however , these authors conclude that the collapse / projection of state after a measurement is problematic for a physical property which should have _ a reality of its own _  @xcite .",
    "this brings us to the well known measurement problem of quantum mechanics , namely the apparently nonunitary collapse of the state  @xcite .",
    "decoherence by an environment provides a better description of measurement of quantum system than the collapse , see e.g.  @xcite for recent reviews and evidence for decoherence  @xcite , and  @xcite for review of proposed solutions of measurement problem , mainly based on dynamical approaches .",
    "however , decoherence is not accepted by everyone , and questions and criticisms against it have been raised in the literature see e.g.  @xcite is applied to an initial state @xmath9 depending on a variable @xmath10 and @xmath11 is discontinuous at @xmath12 , then @xmath13 .",
    "apart from numerous alternative interpretations , a number of authors have tried to construct quantum theory from a set of axioms that give it a structure very close to statistics .",
    "for instance , in a frequentist / measurement approach to classical statistical mechanics and quantum theory 5 axioms are proposed  @xcite from which 4 are satisfied by both theories and the last one only by quantum mechanics . furthermore , in  @xcite a similar construction inspired by quantum information theory with only 3 axioms is suggested . in both models the complex hilbert space of quantum states is projected to a real vector space which presents probabilities for outcomes of measurements . in",
    "@xcite a model based on purely informational principles and operational probability is claimed to include quantum mechanics by adding one axiom to the 5 axioms of the model .",
    "however , several issues such as the origin of probabilistic outcome of _ circuits _ , which are elementary objects of this model , is not discussed . moreover",
    ", the state space of outcomes stays abstract and crucial issues such as observed absence of hidden variables and ( non-)contextuality are not discussed .",
    "in fact their concept of coarse - graining should induce hidden variables and their first axiom _ causality _ , as it is described , seems to be in contradiction with the observed contextuality of quantum mechanics .",
    "another approach for understanding measurement and decoherence issues is coupling of a classical system , e.g. a macroscopic measurement apparatus , with a quantum system . in this method",
    "either the classical system is extended to a quantum setting by applying superselection operators  @xcite or the classical phase space is _ complexified _",
    "then the analogy between classical poisson bracket and commutation relation is used to treat both systems in a similar manner .",
    "an application of this methodology  @xcite , which satisfies consistency relations for performing the division to classical and quantum sub - systems of an ensemble is useful for studying large quantum systems .",
    "however , this approach fails its original aim of showing that quantum mechanics is some sort of generalization of classical mechanics .",
    "for instance , the characteristics of an ideal _ deterministic _ measurement apparatus obtained in  @xcite is nothing else than what is called _ quantum nondemolition measurement _  @xcite .",
    "we should remind that numerous analogy between quantum and classical systems are found and can be used for the study and simulation of quantum systems , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "an examples is an invertible map between hamiltonian of integer valued classical automata and bandwidth limited harmonic oscillator solutions of schrdinger equation  @xcite .",
    "however , similarities are limited to mathematical descriptions and no classical analogue for purely quantum effects such as entanglement and contextuality is known .    for the sake of clarity of what issues the present work wants to address here we summarize criticisms against quantum mechanics  @xcite :",
    "* meaning of a quantum state : * similar to classical statistical physics , a quantum mechanical state defines a probability for measurement outcomes . but why does quantum mechanics seem to be a complete description of nature , i.e. violates bell s inequalities ?",
    "in contrast to classical statistical mechanics , why does not the measurement of the probability of each outcome determine the state completely , i.e. decomposition coefficients are in general complex , create interference , and their norm square rather than themselves correspond to probability ?    * measurement problems : * after a measurement , why do measured quantities behave classically , i.e. immediate measurements afterward give the same outcome ?",
    "collapse , entanglement , decoherence ? what is really measured ,",
    "i.e. how is a pointer basis selected ?    in this work we show that the issues and questions summarized above can be understood if we describe the relation between a system and an observer or environment by symmetries and the process of measurement as their breaking .",
    "this interpretation does not modify the established principles of quantum mechanics and the process of measurement  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we prefer to call it a new _ description _ or _ language _ for presenting quantum mechanics rather than a new interpretation , construction , or emergence .",
    "the concept of symmetry is not new for quantum mechanics and quantum information .",
    "for instance , in algebraic quantum mechanics  @xcite symmetries of state space ( hilbert space ) and their relation with their classical analogues are extensively used to demonstrate the appearance of superselections by decoherence .",
    "however , symmetries are not considered as a foundational necessity even when issues such as measurement problems are addressed  @xcite . in",
    "@xcite the crucial role of symmetries in quantum mechanics is recognized , and superposition and indeterminism are associated to symmetries . but no axiomatic construction for quantum physics based on symmetries is proposed . moreover ,",
    "emphasis is on symmetries of spacetime coordinates which are considered to have their own properties without any connection to quantum physics and quantum effects are considered to be manifestations of relativistic spacetime symmetries .",
    "here we present a systematic and axiomatic description of quantum mechanics in which symmetries and their representations have a central place in the construction of the theory and in the interpretation of physical world .",
    "in fact symmetries can be considered as extension of the fundamental logical concept of equality .",
    "they provide the necessary logical and mathematical tool for understanding both _",
    "static _ concepts such as the nature of state space and _ dynamical _ processes such as the evolution of the state of a system which satisfies schrdinger equation ( or dirac / klein - gordon equation in relativistic cases ) , probabilistic outcome of measurements , and interference and nonlocal entanglement between components that do not have a counterpart in classical statistical physics .    in sec .",

    "notably , we use a well known theorem by sinai to prove that measurement and decoherence can be treated as phase transition following the breaking of a symmetry .",

    "a quantum system is defined by its symmetries .",
    "its state is a vector belonging to a projective vector space called _ state space _ representing its symmetry groups .",
    "observables are associated to self - adjoint operators and a set of independent observables is isomorphic to a subspace of commuting elements of the space of self - adjoint ( hermitian ) operators acting on the state space .",
    "[ poststate ] 2 .",
    "the state space of a composite system is homomorphic to the direct product of state spaces of its components . in the special case of non - interacting ( separable ) components",
    ", this homomorphism becomes an isomorphism.[postcomposite ] 3 .",
    "evolution of a system is unitary and ruled by conservation laws imposed by its symmetries and their representation by state space .",
    "[ postunitary ] 4 .",
    "decomposition coefficients of a state to eigen vectors of an observable presents the symmetry / degeneracy of the system with respect to its environment according to that observable .",
    "its measurement is * by definition * the operation of breaking this symmetry / degeneracy .",
    "the outcome of the measurement is the eigen value of the eigen state to which the symmetry is broken .",
    "this spontaneous why the breaking of degeneracy between states should be classified as spontaneous . ]",
    "symmetry breaking reduces the state space ( the representation ) to subspace generated by other independent observables.[postmeasure ] 5 .",
    "a probability independent of measurement details is associated to eigen values of an observable as the outcome of a measurement .",
    "it presents the amount of symmetry / degeneracy of the state before its breaking by the measurement process .",
    "[ postsymmbr ]    these axioms are very similar to their analogue in the standard quantum mechanics except that we do not assume a abstract hilbert space is a complete inner product vector space .",
    "completeness is defined as the following : if the convergent point of all series of vectors @xmath14 which converge absolutely , e.i .",
    "@xmath15 , belongs to h. ] .",
    "we demonstrate this property of state spaces using axioms ( [ poststate ] ) and ( [ postsymmbr ] ) in sec .",
    "[ sec : random ] .",
    "in addition , we emphasize on the presence of symmetries in any quantum system and the fact that they distinguish one system from others .",
    "furthermore , these postulates introduce a definition for measurement as operation of breaking a symmetry , independent of how it is performed i.e. by a designed apparatus or by interaction with another system or the rest of the universe - the environment .",
    "it may look like a projection / collapse , i.e. a jump as it is the case in first - order phase transitions or be continuous through entanglement with environment and decoherence .",
    "additionally , we will show that the abstract concept of symmetry provides a basis - independent mean for describing observables .",
    "it can explain the problem of selected pointer basis during a measurement and ambiguity of observed quantities raised in the literature  @xcite .    in standard quantum mechanics ,",
    "measurement axioms attribute a probability to projection / collapse / decoherence of a state @xmath16 to a state @xmath17 equal to @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the density operator associated to the state @xmath16 and @xmath20 is the projection operator to @xmath17 . here",
    "we will obtain this relation from properties of probability distribution functions and their application to composite systems described under axiom ( [ postcomposite ] ) .",
    "symmetry can be considered as the generalization of equality and similarity concepts which are the basis of our logical and physical understanding of the universe , see e.g.  @xcite for symmetries in logic .",
    "the operation of measurement is nothing else than determining similarity between a characteristic of an object / system with one belonging to a reference .",
    "in fact , symmetry is our _ only _ tool for abstraction of the universe .",
    "a question that arises here is whether it is necessary to assume a division of the universe to _ system _ and _ observer _ or _",
    "environment_. in a logical view , the concept of similarity makes sense only if there are at least two objects to be compared . in a mathematical view and in the framework of set theory , which we assume to be applicable to all objects including the universe , only an empty set does not have subsets . in this sense ,",
    "any indivisible set is either a subset of a larger set , or is isomorphic to an empty set , and therefore it is meaningless to discuss about its properties .",
    "consequently , a nontrivial universe must have at least two non - empty nontrivial subsets , which can be called _ system _ and _ observer _ or _",
    "environment_. this argument shows that the necessity of having an observer / environment is not because without it quantum mechanics becomes meaningless but because a subsystem is required for assuring that universe is not trivial .",
    "fig [ univdiag ] shows a schematic presentation of this description .",
    "indicates the shared / entangled information between system and environment ( or observer ) usually called apparatus .",
    "the overlap - interaction - between these subsystems is necessary , otherwise they can not exchange information and each of them can be considered as a separate universe .",
    "each observable / property ( cross symbols ) is associated to a symmetry group .",
    "the union of representation vector spaces for symmetries is called the _",
    "state space_. there is a one - to - one automorphism between the maximal abelian subgroup and observables presented by projection arrows from system to representation ( state ) vector space [ univdiag],width=566 ]    in the following sections we describe in more details axioms [ poststate]-[postsymmbr ] and how they help understand enigmatic issues summarized in the introduction .",
    "symmetries are inherent to physical laws .",
    "examples are poincar symmetry of spacetime , gauge symmetries of fundamental interactions , global family symmetry of elementary particles , etc .",
    "they are intrinsic and always preserved unless broken explicitly by specific interactions .",
    "although in standard quantum mechanics the hilbert space is an abstract object introduced by axioms , in practice it is always related to symmetries of the system . in axioms [ poststate]-[postsymmbr ]",
    "the emphasis is on symmetries and they provide a foundation for definition of physical systems . according to axiom ( [ poststate ] ) a physical system - a subset of the universal set of the universe - is abstracted by its symmetries and their representations which define the vector space of states .",
    "symmetries of physical systems are dominantly ( if not always ) lie groups .",
    "therefore , for the sake of simplicity through this work we restrict our arguments to them .",
    "this category also includes discrete crystal groups which are subgroup of lie groups .",
    "vector spaces representing symmetry groups are generated by eigen vectors of their commuting subgroup , which according to axiom ( [ poststate ] ) defines independent observables .",
    "evidently the decomposition of an arbitrary state vector depends on the selected basis .",
    "nonetheless , this does not affect the fact that another basis corresponds to eigen vectors of commuting elements of the symmetries too , and a change of basis only modifies the decomposition of states ( vectors ) not their identity or nature .",
    "therefore , in this description observables have an identity independent of the chosen basis .",
    "for this reason , the question raised in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] about the pointer basis is irrelevant .",
    "for example , spin of particles are related to @xmath21 symmetry which the abelian subalgebra of its associated algebra is 1-dimensional . because this is the rotation group in a 3-dim space , the generator of abelian subalgebra is usually associated to one of the frame axes .",
    "nonetheless , any other vector can be equally considered as the generator of the abelian subalgebra . what matters is the concept of commuting subgroup , not its basis - dependent representation .",
    "symmetry groups have many representations .",
    "degeneracies of a system determines the representation realized by its state space . in turn",
    ", degeneracies can be considered as an * induced symmetry * that we call _ state symmetry_. for example , consider as system a @xmath22 particle decaying to two photons with opposite spins and the rest of the universe as environment / observer . in presence of a magnetic field , the interaction of the field with charged quark - antiquark of @xmath22 defines a preferred direction for spins ( helicities ) of oppositely propagating photons .",
    "this breaks spherical symmetry of pion s environment and gives the observer some information about the spin ( helicity ) of e.g. the photon emitted to the hemisphere in the direction of magnetic field .",
    "if the field is very strong , the photon can have only one polarization , i.e. its state space would be a trivial representation of spin @xmath23 symmetry . in absence of an external field",
    "no preferred direction is present and the spin of each photon at production is completely arbitrary . in this case",
    "the state has a spherical symmetry reflected in the equal coefficient of components when the state is decomposed to eigen states of the maximal abelian subgroup of @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , this symmetry / degeneracy of spin states is independent of other properties , notably geometry and distance between particles and is a global property .",
    "cautious is in order when identifying symmetries of a system and their representations .",
    "the simplest way of discussing this issue is through an example : consider the electron in a hydrogen atom .",
    "the nucleus ( proton ) creates a spherically symmetric electric potential in which electron is moving .",
    "then , what is the symmetry of electron as a system when the aim is measuring its position ?",
    "a naive view may conclude a spherical @xmath24 symmetry .",
    "indeed , this is the symmetry of lagrangian or schrdinger equation . on the other hand , in the electron frame",
    "the electric potential is not spherically symmetric .",
    "only if the electron can _ see _ the whole space , i.e. when it is not localized the potential and space look spherically symmetric .",
    "the only symmetry - meaning degeneracy or degree of freedom - related to the position of electron is translation symmetry in @xmath25 space .",
    "evidently this is not a perfect symmetry ( degeneracy ) because the presence of a positive electric charge prefers points closer to the nucleus rather than further .",
    "therefore , the state of the electron is represented by the infinite - dimensional abelian translation symmetry @xmath26 where @xmath27 is 1d translation group . due to rotational symmetry of potential eigen states of position",
    "operator - obtained from solution of schtdinger equation - have simple description when they are decomposed to radial and angular components , and solutions are classified by two @xmath28 and @xmath29 integers .",
    "nonetheless , a probability must be associated to position of electron , e.g. in spherical reference frame @xmath30 .",
    "this example shows that the state vector space represents symmetries which define degrees of freedom of a system rather than its dynamics which is related to its interactions .",
    "once an observable is _ measured _",
    "( we define this operation in sec .",
    "[ sec : measure ] ) , according to axiom ( [ postmeasure ] ) the state symmetry or degeneracy between eigen vectors breaks , and thereby the representation is reduced to trivial .",
    "state symmetries ( degeneracies ) are related to system s history , initial conditions , and/or preparation .",
    "consequently , they are ephemeral and may be total or partial . in",
    "the former case coefficients of decomposition of the state to eigen vectors are equal . otherwise , the symmetry is partial , meaning that the system s history or environment somehow discriminates between eigen states but can not single out one of them .",
    "the symmetry of states is by definition associated to and inseparable from system - environment symmetries .",
    "therefore , breaking of degeneracies is comparable and analogue to spontaneous symmetry breaking in which the symmetry is broken in states but not ( or softly ) in the lagrangian ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : measure ] for more details ) .    only in vector spaces defined over complex numbers @xmath31 ,",
    "operators with non - zero determinant are always diagonlizable .",
    "this property is necessary to ensure the existence of a basis composed of eigen vectors for every observable .",
    "because , properties of a system are by definition conserved under application of its symmetry group @xmath32 , and observables are self - adjoint ( hermitian ) operators , representation of symmetry groups by state space must be unitary .",
    "this requirement enforces the necessity of definition of state space over @xmath31 .",
    "although many groups are unitarily represented by vector spaces defined over real numbers , complete set of representations are realized on a complex field .",
    "are isomorphic to real representations with double dimensions which are not minimal and can be considered as alternative definition of a complex representation .",
    "they are analogue to presenting complex numbers by their real and imaginary components . ] . in standard quantum mechanics",
    "similar procedures are used to define a hilbert space , but the role of symmetries is not considered as a foundational aspect .",
    "application of a group member transfers a state : |= _ a_| , | |= u | ,",
    "u g | |= _  a_|[decomptrans ] here @xmath32 is the symmetry group of the system and we assume that @xmath33 is a complete set of eigen vectors of the maximal abelian subspace .",
    "application of a symmetry transformation projects the maximal abelian subspace to a new subspace but preserves the commutation relation between its members .",
    "the eigen vectors @xmath33 are also projected , but in general they are no longer eigen vectors of the new abelian subspace .",
    "therefore , coefficients @xmath34 do not have the same physical interpretation as @xmath35 .    to better understand the physical process described by ( [ decomptrans ] ) consider a successive stern - gerlach experiment",
    "electrons are polarized by passing through the first stern - gerlach detector , then only one of two polarizations , e.g. @xmath36 is kept .",
    "we identify their state with @xmath16 in ( [ decomptrans ] ) .",
    "the set of eigen states @xmath37 correspond to two polarizations along @xmath38 axis and @xmath39 .",
    "the passage of these electrons to a second detector in which the magnetic field is in e.g. @xmath40 direction is equivalent to application of a symmetry transformation , in this case application of @xmath41 or its representation in pauli matrix @xmath42 .",
    "in fact the presence of a magnetic field in @xmath40 direction rotates the preferred direction for electrons which before entering to the second detector was @xmath36 . as explained above this operation",
    "projects the abelian subspace , here to the subspace in the @xmath40 direction , and according to postulate ( [ poststate ] ) observables are members of the new abelian subspace i.e. @xmath41 . in agreement with experiments , a simple calculation shows that the expansion of @xmath43 with respect to eigen vectors of @xmath41 will include both possible polarizations with equal probabilities .",
    "another set of noncommuting measurables which have wondered physicists are position and momentum .",
    "they both represent translation symmetry , but it seems that the collapse / projection of wave function of macroscopic objects prefer position basis .",
    "this even has led to interpretation of quantum mechanics / quantum gravity with position as preferred observable  @xcite .",
    "this is evidently a misinterpretation .",
    "what we actually measure is @xmath44 which commutes with @xmath45 ( here we have used heisenberg picture ) .",
    "most objects are non - relativistic , thus @xmath46 , i.e. they looks to be in a position eigen state .    in conclusion consideration of active role of symmetries solves what is called _ preferred basis issue_. in contrast to classical mechanics , in quantum systems symmetries have an operative role and induce degeneracies - through non - trivial representation of symmetry group - which reflects history and relation of a system with its environment .      in classical statistical mechanics",
    "a system with @xmath47 observables has a configuration space isomorphic to @xmath48 irrespective of symmetries , except for conservation relations . in this space , a states is a point rather than a vector , and probabilities are @xmath49 simplexes in @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "symmetries have passive roles , i.e. reduce the number of degrees of freedom and make distribution of some observables similar .",
    "for instance , spherical symmetry means that properties such as distribution of particles and their density is spherically uniform .",
    "but this property does not induce any constraints on observables .",
    "in particular , states do not present a representation of @xmath24 symmetry group which needs a vector space .",
    "it is noteworthy to remind that in general , symmetry groups are non - abelian and their maximal abelian subalgebra presenting independent observables of quantum systems has a smaller dimension than the whole group",
    ". therefore , quantum systems have less independent observables than their classical analogues .",
    "this is another manifestation of the active role of symmetries in quantum mechanics which imposes constraints on quantum systems absent in their classical analogue .",
    "according to axiom ( [ postcomposite ] ) the ensemble of two or more subsystems can be considered as a system with a symmetry group homomorphic to direct product of symmetries of its components .",
    "deviation of this homomorphy from an isomorphy presents the strength of interaction between subsystems .",
    "this axiom is particularly important for understanding entanglement , measurement problems , and decoherence of quantum systems . in this regard ,",
    "symmetries provide a natural criteria for division of the universe to subsystems / components according to their symmetries . in the example of a decaying @xmath22 in se .",
    "[ sec : repgen ] , the system is composed of three subsystems each with @xmath51 symmetry .",
    "their ensemble has @xmath52 symmetry where the first @xmath23 corresponds to the global symmetry under rotation and the second one the spin symmetry of photons .",
    "this division is valid only when photons are sufficiently far from their production place and can be considered as non - interacting .      from close relation of fundamental interactions and symmetry groups , and from universality of gravitational interaction -",
    "for which we do not yet have a quantum description - we conclude that the decomposition of the universe to subsystems is not orthogonal , i.e. it is not possible to decompose the universe to two quantum subsystems @xmath53 and @xmath54 with state spaces satisfying properties imposed by axioms ( [ poststate ] ) and ( [ postcomposite ] ) such that @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , it is an ensemble of intertwined vector spaces , i.e. universe is topologically open and for any system @xmath56 there is a system @xmath57 such that @xmath58 .",
    "a direct consequence of this observation is _ the absence of any isolated system in the universe_. therefore , division to system / apparatus / environment is always an approximation . in another word , classical locality and separability of the world",
    "are only approximately valid and the universe is inherently nonlocal , composite but inseparable .",
    "this observation answers criticisms raised against decoherence as the origin of classical behaviour of macroscopic systems based on the claim that it only approximately suppress interferences .",
    "in fact it is classicality and locality of macroscopic world which are approximations and consequence of a coarse - grained presentation of an otherwise quantic universe .    because classicality is just an approximation , the universe as a whole",
    "must be considered as a quantum system , and there should exist a state space representing its global symmetries .",
    "they must be related to symmetries of its components by a homomorphism similar to ( [ comphomorph ] ) below .",
    "if the projection is trivial , the universe will have a single state meaning that it globally looks classical . if it is roughly isomorphic ,",
    "its state is simply the direct multiplication of state spaces of its components .",
    "if it is neither trivial nor isomorphic , but isomorphic to a small nontrivial symmetry , the universe may have global structures .",
    "according to postulate ( [ postmeasure ] ) a measurement by definition breaks what we called symmetry or degeneracy of states ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : repgen ] ) , and reduces the state space to a subspace in which the operator presenting the measured quantity is represented trivially . in the following subsections",
    "we show that this process is similar to spontaneous symmetry breaking in macroscopic systems . because independent observables are abelian",
    ", the reduction of algebra does not affect states of other observables .",
    "in fact , the algebra generated by independent observables can be divided to quasi - orthogonal subalgebras .",
    "notably , the measurement of an observable which commutes with spacetime operators do not depend on the position state and is global .",
    "this explains the apparent paradox of epr - type experiments .",
    "indeed , according to postulate ( [ postmeasure ] ) the measurement of the spin of one of the entangled particles breaks rotational symmetry , i.e. defines a pointer / preferred direction , and the state symmetry becomes trivial , i.e. is no longer a superposition of eigen states .",
    "then , the entanglement ensures that the state of the other particle is automatically fixed irrespective of the distance between two particles , because @xmath23 spin symmetry and spacetime translation symmetry commute .      in quantum measurements ( and classical measurements",
    "when direct comparison with a reference is not possible ) an interaction between system and measurement apparatus is necessary .",
    "it may explicitly breaks some of symmetries of the system .",
    "for instance , for measuring spin of a particle , interaction with an external magnetic field or spin of another particle is necessary .",
    "assuming that the direction of the spin of the particle before measurement is unknown , its preparation had to be under a spherically symmetric condition . the interaction with a field inside the apparatus defines a preferred direction and explicitly breaks the spherical symmetry in system - apparatus lagrangian .",
    "on the other hand , interaction with spin may or may not induce a preferred direction .",
    "for instance , if the interaction between two spins is antisymmetric , i.e. proportional to @xmath59 ( dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction  @xcite ) , where indices @xmath60 and @xmath61 indicate system and apparatus respectively , the transverse plane to @xmath62 can be considered as preferred plane .",
    "then , if the direction of the spin to be measured is already known to be in the plane , e.g. photons propagate in vacuum parallel to @xmath62 , there is no preferred direction on the plane . in standard description of quantum mechanics",
    "this seems problematic because it is not clear which component of spin vector is measured . in symmetry description",
    "there is no ambiguity , and in both cases in this example the measured observable is the unique generator of abelian subalgebra of @xmath23 which is independent of arbitrary definition of coordinates on the plane .",
    "modern literature on foundation of quantum mechanics present measurement as entanglement between system and apparatus such that the quantum nature of both be explicit  @xcite : _",
    "s_| , a_[measentangle ] where @xmath63 is the initial state of the apparatus and @xmath64 is an arbitrary basis for the system .",
    "the interaction between two spins , one considered as system and the other as apparatus , is an example for ( [ measentangle ] ) .    in the framework of symmetry description , system and apparatus",
    "must have an interaction related to the symmetry represented by states @xmath64 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we assume that this representation is finite with dimension @xmath65 . to distinguish between these states ,",
    "the initial apparatus representation must be @xmath66 dimensional .",
    "the entanglement by interaction breaks the @xmath67 \\otimes [ m]$ ] dimensional representation of system - apparatus to an @xmath67 $ ] dimensional representation of the symmetry \\otimes [ m ] \\rightarrow [ n']$ ] . if @xmath68 some outcomes would be equivalent . if @xmath69 the apparatus will not be able to single out some states and they may create an interference . ] .",
    "this process is usually explicit and is related to the design of the apparatus .",
    "some criticisms have been raised against this approach  @xcite because there is no guarantee that @xmath70 states be orthogonal to each others . however , as we discussed in the previous subsection , this is not really a problem because the right hand side of ( [ measentangle ] ) presents the only physically meaningful entity , namely the observable(s ) - the member(s ) of maximal abelian subspace - associated to the symmetry in the representation realized by @xmath70 , even if these states are not its(their ) eigen vectors .",
    "entanglement approach does not clarify the final breaking of degeneracies .",
    "one solution could be the repetition of entanglement process with more and more larger apparatus until regress breaks by a macroscopic classical apparatus / environment : _ s_||a_0 |e_0 _ s_| , a_|e_0 _ s_| , a _ , e_[decoherentangle ] but this argument does not resolve the conceptual fact that one of states must be selected among many others , and criticisms are raised against decoherence as a replacement for nonunitary collapse to a pointer state  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , decoherence seems to be the most physically motivated explanation for random selection of one eigen state by a measurement .",
    "moreover , it is consistent with modern quantum experiments in which even macroscopic systems can be kept in entangled or superposition states for significant amount of time if their interaction with environment can be prevented  @xcite .    in the framework of symmetry description",
    ", the large number of degrees of freedom of environment means that it realizes an infinite dimensional representation of the symmetry to which the observable belongs . assuming system in an @xmath71-dimensional representation of the symmetry , according to postulate ( [ postcomposite ] ) the composite system - environment is in @xmath72 representation if there is no interaction between them or in a subspace of it in presence of interaction . in particular ,",
    "an entanglement reduces their state to :    @xmath73 and @xmath74 indicate system and environment , respectively , and @xmath75 and @xmath76 represent eigen / pointer vectors of the system and components of the environment , respectively .",
    "it is conceivable that there are large number of equivalent realizations of the symmetry in ( [ sysenventang ] ) .",
    "for instance , the state @xmath75 most probably entangles only to few spatially closest components of environment and others play the role of spectators . because freedom degrees / components of the environment are not observed , states in ( [ sysenventang ] ) form infinite equivalence classes of the representation of the symmetry realized by @xmath75 .",
    "they play a role similar to statistical ensemble in classical statistical mechanics and induce a probability for occurrence of a specific @xmath75 as outcome of a measurement .",
    "nonetheless , there is a significant difference with classical case .",
    "random selection of one of the members of these equivalence classes breaks the symmetry and its realization by the system becomes trivial .",
    "therefore , in contrast to classical case , immediate repetition of the measurement on the same system gives the same value for the observable .",
    "although the environment plays the role of a hidden variable , equivalence classes are tagged by the system , and once the symmetry is broken , both system and environment are constrained to the selected value of the observable and symmetry representation becomes trivial .",
    "thus , symmetry and its breaking have crucial roles for existence of equivalence classes and decoherence , and for repetition of outcome in successive similar measurements .",
    "moreover , because equivalence classes realize the same representation of symmetry as the system , probability is determined by the symmetry / degeneracy of the state of system and is completely independent of the environment .",
    "the process of entanglement of system with environment is similar to phase transition . assuming that the coupling between system and apparatus - environment is switched on at an initial time ,",
    "e.g. the moment an electron enters a stern - gerlach detector , the effect of coupling influences the state of closest components / degrees of freedom of the apparatus - environment , which in turn affect the state of other components .",
    "however , further the component , less perturbation in its state .",
    "with passage of time , one expects that an equilibrium will be reached where the state of some components are locked to a state determined by the state of the system .",
    "this is when entanglement occurs and a state similar to ( [ sysenventang ] ) is reached .",
    "mathematically , the state of infinite number of components / degrees of freedom of system - environment or @xmath77 coefficients of their projection on an arbitrary base @xmath78 of the state @xmath79 can be treated as a random field .",
    "it is proved that under suitable conditions , which should be satisfied by a suitable measurement apparatus , the probability distribution function of a random field to which a hamiltonian is associated , is a limit gibbs distribution , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "assuming that perturbation of environment - apparatus induced by the system is small , the hamiltonian has a number of ground states and distribution of the random field is composed of disjoint limit gibbs distributions around these states . in the case of the random field defined by states in ( [ sysenventang ] ) , before completion of entanglement these disjoint distributions around ground states",
    "are what leads to formation of equivalence classes .",
    "the sinai theorem of phase transition  @xcite proves that for perturbations ( noise / temperature ) lower than a critical value , there always exists a set of small critical couplings ( smaller than an upper limit ) such that each limit gibbs distributions is a single phase , i.e. the system has an asymptotic probability of 1 to be in one of the stable ground states .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian of system - environment @xmath80 presents the coupling between them .",
    "considering hamiltonian of classical systems and their quantum analogues , interaction hamiltonian of an arbitrary system - environment should have the following general form : h _ i , j = 1^n f ( a_i , a^*_j , _",
    "ij ) , e,|e,= _ i , j = 1^n a_i a^*_j = 1 [ measurehamilt ] where @xmath81 are couplings .",
    "the second equality is a constraint on coefficients when they are interpreted as probabilities ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : random ] ) .",
    "although we have used a countable index for system - environment pointer states , they can be uncountable and continuous . in this limit cases coefficients @xmath77 can be considered as a random field .",
    "then , sinai theorem shows that for a combination of couplings @xmath81 and small perturbation of @xmath82 , the system approaches one of stable minima of the hamiltonian , irrespective of details of ( [ measurehamilt ] ) .    for instance , in a stern - gelach experiment , the environment is composed of photons of the detectors magnetic field and spins of atoms in the detector and outside of it .",
    "although all these components contribute in state @xmath83 , only a limited number of photons get the chance to interact with the passing electron .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian between two spins is proportional to @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , the classical hamiltonian ( [ measurehamilt ] ) depends on @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the eigen value of projection of one spin on the other , and has a discrete support . even if the state of the electron is initially a superposition of two polarizations , according to sinai theorem , the field @xmath82 approaches randomly to one of two minima of the hamiltonian - corresponding to alignment along or opposite to detector s field - with a probability very close to 1 .",
    "this corresponds to entanglement of the spin of environment with the system ( electron ) and breaking of state symmetry as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : symmbrdeco ] .    application of sinai theorem proves , in a detail - independent manner , that if the setup of a measurement is suitable , i.e. interactions are not too small or too large , a symmetry breaking does occur and it is a direct consequence of quantum entanglement which makes the classical hamiltonian to approache one of its ground states and stays there .",
    "this theorem also predicts the existence of surfaces in coupling space in which multiple phases can coexist . for quantum systems they correspond to cases where interaction with environment can not completely break the symmetry between states , in another word @xmath87 are not orthogonal and an interference between states occurs .",
    "it is well known that phase transition is related to topological properties of configuration space - in the case of quantum systems the composite system - environment state space , see  @xcite for mathematical theorems and  @xcite for review of topological properties involved in phase transition of strongly correlated systems . in symmetry description of quantum mechanics the change of at least one of topological properties ,",
    "namely the topology of state space itself is obvious .",
    "in fact as a projective complex space , the topology of state space is closely related to @xmath88-spheres .",
    "it is reduced to a point i.e. trivial topology by measurement or to @xmath89-spheres with @xmath90 when the apparatus - environment does not completely breaks the degeneracy of states and produces interference .",
    "this is in clear contrast with statistical systems in which measurements do not change configuration space and its geometrical properties . due to this topological change phase transition by quantum measurement or decoherence",
    "can be classified as first order because of discontinuous reduction of representation from an @xmath71-dimensional state space to a trivial 1-dimensional subspace .",
    "the resolution of apparatus or the strength of its interaction with environment can be considered as an order parameter .",
    "phase transition occurs when interactions are stronger than a threshold value , otherwise only an interference or entanglement between components may occur without full symmetry breaking .",
    "for instance in stern - gerlach experiment if the magnetic field is too weak , deflection for two polarization would be too small and they will not be separated .",
    "other examples in which the outcome can be interpreted as phase transition are explained in  @xcite .",
    "a question arises here : should a quantum system - environment have a large number of freedom degrees such that a large chunk of it plays the role of environment and makes the measurement of smaller subsystems meaningful ?",
    "note that sinai theorem can be applied only to systems with many degrees of freedom .    here",
    "we argue that this is not necessary , and although decoherence helps to understand the classical world more easily , it is not a necessary condition .",
    "consider a universe consisting of two particles / subsystems with states @xmath91 and@xmath92 . by definition",
    "no other substructure / subsystem exists .",
    "the only observable in this small universe is the comparison between states of the two subsystems , thus the symmetry group is @xmath93 .",

    "but because the state space is projective , @xmath91 and @xmath103 are indistinguishable .",
    "averaging operation is also impossible , after the first measurement states of the two subsystems would be either equal or opposite and stay as such for ever .",
    "therefore , it would not be possible to repeat the comparison operation unless there are multiple universes of the same kind , and an external observer who performs averaging between outcomes .",
    "therefore , in accord with @xmath93 symmetry of this universe , the observer can only verify if its state is completely similarity or opposite to its neighbour .",
    "after the first measurement there would not be any superposition and it looks classical .",
    "the above example shows that if the symmetry of a quantum system is abelian , i.e. it has only abelian observables , their simultaneous measurement completely fixes its state once for ever and there would not be further evolution .",
    "therefore , a universe composed of such systems would be static without any notion of time . from this observation",
    "we conclude that a dynamical universe is composed of systems with some non - abelian symmetries and interactions depending on noncommuting observables . in this way",
    "a system can not continue to be in an eigen state of all observables . in this context , position operator as an observable has a special importance for dynamical behaviour of systems . by definition",
    "a system which is in an eigen state of position is static and does not evolve .",
    "in classical physics position and momentum or variation of position are independent observables . in quantum mechanics",
    "the momentum - the generator of translation symmetry - is proportional to @xmath105 and does not commute with position operator .",
    "indeed it was meaningless if an object could be at the same time in eigen state of position and its variation .",
    "this gives a logical insight into heisenberg uncertainty principle and quantum zeno effect  @xcite .",
    "axiom ( [ postsymmbr ] ) is very similar to its analogue in standard quantum mechanics but it does not specify how the probability is determined , because we obtain it in this section from axioms and some general properties of probability distributions . since the discovery of quantum mechanics and observation of randomness in outcome of measurements - unsharp outcomes  @xcite , physicists have been searching for _ hidden variables _",

    "following axiom ( [ poststate ] ) , the state of a system contains all obtainable information about it , including probabilities associated to pointer states consisting of eigen states of independent observables .",
    "because any vector belonging to the state space can be decomposed to a pointer basis , it is logical to conclude that the expansion coefficients must be related to the probability that the system be in the corresponding eigen state when the symmetry / degeneracy is broken .",
    "giving the fact that probabilities must be positive real numbers , the square of the absolute value of coefficients @xmath106 is the most natural candidate .",

    "interference is only partially removed by decoherence .",
    "[ decohinterf ] 2 .",
    "decoherence needs open systems , thus can not be applied to the universe as a whole .",
    "[ decohopen ] 3 .",
    "how does the separation of system and environment influence the state to which a system decohere ?",
    "[ decohsep ] 4 .",
    "decoherence in relativistic quantum field theory .",
    "[ decohqft ]    to these criticisms we must add the ambiguity of pointer basis which we discussed its explanation in symmetry description in sec . [ sec : measure ] .",
    "we have also addressed system - environment separation in symmetry view and have argued that separability is always an approximation and the presence of anisotropies at all scales in the universe and nonlocality of quantum systems make decoherence a natural and omnipresent phenomenon .",
    "here we concentrate on the rest of raised issues and discuss how symmetry description may help to understand them .",
    "we have discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : measuredecoher ] the breaking of symmetries and degeneracy of states by interaction with environment during a measurement .",
    "the same concept is applicable to all subsystems of the universe .",

    "moreover , mutual influence of system and environment through entanglement and phase transition discussed in secs .",
    "[ sec : symmbrdeco ] and [ sec : symmbrspontan ] ensures that the universe can be considered as a closed system and no intervention from an outside observer is necessary to make it real or meaningful .",
    "therefore , issues [ decohinterf ] and [ decohopen ] are not real , and their resolution in the framework of symmetry decryption is explicit and mathematically pronounced .      in what concerns classicality of the universe as a whole , in sec .",
    "[ sec : insepar ] we argued that universe must be considered as an intertwined ensemble of its components and its global state is simply union of the states of its components .",
    "if the components are decohered , so is the universe .",

    "if this is true , only a fraction of the universe behaves classically .",
    "in addition , the example discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : dyntime ] shows that a probabilistic interpretation of measurements performed on large modes maybe meaningless because for them universe is _ small _ and they have access only to a single copy of it .",
    "it rests however one question : does the universe globally represent a symmetry non - trivially , i.e. can a homomorphism similar to ( [ comphomorph ] ) consisting of all entities in the universe be nontrivial ?",

    "for instance , in the example of a decaying pion in sec .",
    "[ sec : state ] , considering a magnetic field , even a weak one , as part of the system completely changes the definition of the system from first place , and thereby symmetries that define the state space , possible outcomes , etc .",

    "a system is defined by its symmetries .",
    "therefore , characteristics of the environment do not matter for the system as long as they do not change its symmetries . in the example above , including the magnetic field in the environment does not change its interaction with the system , but an observer would not be able to conclude its presence from measuring the probability of unknown spin states .",
    "finally , ( [ decohqft ] ) refers to the fact that relativistic quantum field theories do not admit a superselection  @xcite , and thereby algebraic description can not explain decoherence . on the other hand , the entanglement between system and environment defined by ( [ sysenventang ] ) is valid for quantum fields too .",
    "although the notion of environment in qft is loose , for perturbative systems far from interaction zone , particles can be considered as isolated and usual rules of decoherence discussed in sec . [",

    "quantum states present complete obtainable information about systems and are much more than simple probabilistic distribution of measurement outcomes which classical statistical states represent . in addition , state space as a representation of symmetries must be defined on complex numbers and the presence of interference between states is the manifestation of active role of symmetries in characterization of quantum systems .",
