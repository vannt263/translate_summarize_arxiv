    "the desargues maps , as defined in @xcite , are maps @xmath2 of multidimensional integer lattice into projective space of dimension @xmath3 over a division ring @xmath4 , such that for any pair of indices @xmath5 the points @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are collinear ; here @xmath9 is the @xmath10-th element of the canonical basis of @xmath11 . under mild genericity conditions , by an appropriate choice of homogeneous coordinates , such maps are described @xcite in terms of solutions @xmath12 of the linear system ( we consider the right vector spaces over @xmath4 ) @xmath13 with the corresponding functions @xmath14 .    the linear system is well known in soliton theory  @xcite .",

    "as it was shown in @xcite the four dimensional compatibility of the desargues maps is equivalent to the celebrated desargues theorem @xcite of the incidence geometry .",
    "however , the above definition of the desargues maps does not exhibit the well known symmetry of the desargues configuration  @xcite ; see also discussion in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we propose more geometric definition of the desargues maps , where instead of the @xmath23 lattice we use the root lattice @xmath24 .",
    "this point of view allows to see , from the very beginning , the corresponding affine weyl group @xmath25 symmetry of the desargues maps and of the non - commutative hirota  miwa system .    at this point",
    "we should mention a recent related work  @xcite of w.  k.  schief , who found a symmetric description of the laplace sequence of two dimensional quadrilateral lattices  @xcite in terms of certain maps of the three dimensional lattice of face - centered cubic combinatorics , which is the root lattice @xmath26 @xcite ; see also section  [ sec : p(k-1,k ) ] for more details .",
    "we remark that in the integrable discrete geometry the face - centered cubic closest sphere packing lattice has been used in @xcite in a different context of a sub - lattice version of miwa s discrete bkp equation  @xcite .",
    "the idea of checking compatibility , on three dimensional lattices generated by tetrahedra , of a system of linear equations on triangular lattices has been announced to me also by m.  nieszporski  @xcite in the context of a six - point linear problem  @xcite , which contains as reductions both the four point and the three point linear problems .",
    "we remark that the @xmath27 root lattice served in @xcite as the parametrization space of the laplace transformations of @xmath28-dimensional quadrilateral lattices @xcite . in this context",
    "it is present explicitly in @xcite , where it was shown that the theory of @xmath28-dimensional quadrilateral lattices and their laplace transformations is the same as the theory of @xmath29-dimensional desargues maps . in describing this equivalence",
    "it was convenient to introduce implicitly the @xmath30 root lattice , but the full geometric flavor of this change of variables has not been observed there .    finally , it is worth to mention that our research has been also motivated by ( extended ) affine weyl groups symmetries of discrete painlev systems  @xcite .",
    "the geometric picture associated to the theory of painlev equations is connected usually with the representation theory of the affine weyl groups in terms of birational actions on rational surfaces  @xcite .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the painlev type equations can be obtained as symmetry reductions of soliton systems . as the present work brings to the light the affine weyl group symmetry already on the level of the hirota ",

    "notice that , by multidimensional compatibility of the desargues maps , the dimension @xmath1 of the root lattice can be arbitrarily large .",

    "we remark that we do not discuss here nor the darboux type transformations of the desargues maps nor the corresponding bcklund type transformations of the hirota ",
    "miwa system .",
    "these results are known on the algebraic level @xcite , and their incidence geometry interpretation follows from the known geometric meaning @xcite of the corresponding transformations of the quadrilateral lattices . because also here , like in many integrable discrete systems @xcite , there is no essential difference between the darboux transformation and a step into new dimension of the lattice system , the permutability of the transformations follows from the multidimensional compatibility of the desargues maps .",
