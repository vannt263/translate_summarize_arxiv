    "recent cosmic ray observations , reported by the fly s eye ( @xcite ) and by the agasa ( @xcite ) experiments , show two major features in the cosmic ray ( cr ) energy spectrum above @xmath6 .",
    "first , a break in the shape of the spectrum is observed at @xmath7 .",
    "second , the cr composition changes from being predominantly heavy nuclei below the break to light nuclei above the break . coupled with the lack of anisotropy , that would be expected",
    "if the crs above @xmath1 were protons produced in the galaxy , these features strongly suggest that the cr flux above @xmath1 is dominated by an extra - galactic component of protons .",
    "this view is supported by the fact that the cr spectrum above @xmath8 is consistent with a cosmological distribution of sources , with a power law generation spectrum @xmath9 ( @xcite , c ) ( below @xmath8 a significant contribution from iron cosmic rays from galactic sources is likely to be present ; bird _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 , waxman 1995b ) .",
    "if the particles observed are indeed protons of extra - galactic origin , and if their sources are correlated with luminous matter , then the inhomogeneity of the large scale galaxy distribution , on scales @xmath10 , should be imprinted on the cr arrival directions . in this paper , we examine the expected anisotropy signature if the cr sources trace the large scale structure ( lss ) , and investigate its dependence on the relative bias between the cr sources and the galaxy distribution and on the ( unknown ) intrinsic cr source density . the galaxy distribution is derived from the 1.2 jy redshift survey ( fisher _ et al . _ 1995 ) .",
    "we find that the expected anisotropy associated with the lss should be detected once the number of cr events detected above @xmath1 is increased by a factor of @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite have recently noted that the arrival directions of @xmath11 cr events detected by the haverah park experiment show a concentration in the direction of the supergalactic plane ( sgp ) which is inconsistent with the hypothesis that the cr sources are distributed isotropically .",
    "we confirm this result , but also find that the haverah park cr distribution is unlikely to be explained by the hypothesis that the cr sources trace the known lss .",
    "we consider a model where the cr flux is produced by a cosmological distribution of proton sources that trace the large scale galaxy distribution .",
    "we model the number density of cr sources in a comoving volume element @xmath12 at redshift @xmath13 as drawn from a poisson distribution with mean @xmath14\\ ,   { \\rm d}v$ ] , where @xmath15 is the average comoving number density of cr sources at redshift @xmath13 and @xmath16 is some ( bias ) functional of the local galaxy overdensity , @xmath17 . with this assumption , we are able to derive in  2.1 a closed analytic expression for the probability of observing a source which produces a specified number of events at a detector for a given exposure and sky coverage . in   2.2 , we apply this formalism to generate monte - carlo realizations of the cr distribution arising from a population of sources which trace the lss seen in the redshift survey . in   2.3 , we analyze the anisotropy of cr arrival distribution and discuss the implications of our results for the observed anisotropy reported by @xcite .",
    "we conclude in   3 .",
    "as they propagate , high energy protons lose energy due to the cosmological redshift and due to the production of pions and @xmath18 pairs caused by interactions with microwave background photons .",
    "we denote by @xmath19 the energy at which a proton must be produced at an epoch @xmath13 in order to be observed at present ( @xmath20 ) with energy @xmath21 . with this definition",
    ", the cr flux above energy @xmath21 , produced by a source at redshift @xmath13 , is given by @xmath22/4\\pi d_l(z)^2 $ ] , where @xmath23 $ ] is the rate at which the source produces protons above energy @xmath21 and @xmath24 is the luminosity distance .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that the sources are identical , so that @xmath25 is given by the present ( @xmath20 ) source number density , @xmath26 , and cr production rate per unit volume , @xmath27 , as @xmath23=\\dot n_0(e)/\\bar s_0 $ ] ( note , however , that it is straightforward to include a source luminosity function in our formalism ) .",
    "the number of detected cr events produced by a source at redshift @xmath13 is modeled as a poisson distribution with mean @xmath28{(1+z)at\\over4\\pi d_l(z)^2 } = { \\dot n_0[e_0(e , z)]\\over\\bar s_0}{(1+z)at\\over4\\pi d_l(z)^2 } , \\label{nbar}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the detector area and observation time respectively .",
    "if many faint sources produce the observed cr events , then a natural assumption would be that each source has a negligible probability of producing more than one event .",
    "however , the density of cr sources is as yet unknown and there is the possibility that the observed events are comprised in part of sources producing multiple events ( repeaters ) . in the following derivation",
    ", we present a formalism which enables the probability that a source will produce one or multiple events to be calculated for a specified source density ; the familiar notion of each source producing only one event is recovered in the limit of infinite source density .",
    "the number of cr _ sources _ in a comoving volume element @xmath12 at redshift @xmath13 is taken to be poisson distributed with mean @xmath31{\\rm d}v$ ] .",
    "the probability that a source would produce @xmath32 detected cr events above energy @xmath21 is @xmath33/i!$ ] .",
    "the probability that the number of sources producing @xmath4 events is @xmath34 , the number of those producing @xmath35 events is @xmath36 , and so on , is @xmath37^{s - n } \\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\prod_i{1\\over n_i!}(\\bar s p_i)^{n_i}e^{-\\bar sp_i}\\quad , \\label{prob}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 .",
    "thus , the number of sources producing @xmath32 events is poisson distributed with average @xmath39 , and is statistically independent of the number of sources producing @xmath40 events .",

    "the average number per steradian of sources producing @xmath32 events in the direction @xmath44 is given by @xmath45\\ , p_i(e , z )   \\quad .",
    "\\label{sbar}\\ ] ]    equation  [ sbar ] makes it easy to compute the mean number of sources producing a given number of events above a given energy and forms the basis for the monte - carlo method described in the next section .",
    "it is straight forward to show that the number per steradian of sources producing more than one detected cr above energy @xmath21 , i.e. the number of repeaters , is poisson distributed with average given by ( [ sbar ] ) with @xmath46\\exp[-\\bar n(e , z)]$ ] .",
    "the mean number per steradian of observed cr events is : @xmath47\\ , { \\dot n_0[e_0(e , z)]\\over\\dot n_0(e)}\\quad . \\label{s1bar}\\ ] ]      we now wish to exploit the formalism of the previous section by making specific monte - carlo realizations of cr arrival directions for a particular detector and exposure time .",
    "equation  [ sbar ] can be used to determine the mean number of sources along a particular line of sight which produce a given number of cr events , once the underlying cosmology , the source evolution @xmath15 , the density field @xmath17 , and the biasing function , @xmath48 $ ] , have been specified . for the numerical calculations of the rest of the paper we adopt the following cosmological scenario : flat universe with zero cosmological constant ( @xmath49 ) , @xmath50 , and non - evolving sources ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "our results are not sensitive to the cosmological parameters ( @xmath52 ) and to source evolution , since crs of energy @xmath11 are produced by sources at distances smaller than @xmath53 ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) , which are short on a cosmological scale . the function @xmath19 is numerically calculated under the above assumptions in a method similar to that described in @xcite .",
    "the proton spectrum generated by the sources is assumed to be a power law , @xmath54 , which is consistent with the observed cr spectrum above @xmath55 ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] presents the fraction of the differential cr flux , that is contributed by sources at distances @xmath56 , for a homogeneous distribution of cr sources , for several values of @xmath57 ( the results are obtained by numerically integrating equation ( [ s1bar ] ) with @xmath58 ) .",
    "the rapid energy loss due to pion production gives rise to the sharp cutoff with distance .",
    "crs with energies @xmath59 must originate from sources within @xmath60 .",
    "high energy crs therefore offer a probe of the relatively local universe which is uncontaminated by distant sources . searching for the signal of anisotropy associated with the lss involves a compromise between diluting of the signal by working with lower energy events and increasing the statistical uncertainty by restricting the analysis to the rare high energy events .",
    "we estimate the large scale galaxy density field by smoothing the galaxy distribution of the 1.2 jy redshift survey ( fisher _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) with a variable gaussian filter with a dispersion given by the larger of @xmath61  and the mean galaxy separation ( cf .",
    "fisher _ et al .",
    "variable smoothing is essential for maintaining high resolution nearby ( @xmath62 ) while simultaneously suppressing shot noise at large distances ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the relatively large local smoothing length of 6.4 ( corresponding to the same volume as a top - hat filter of radius 10 ) was chosen so that the smoothing length remains constant out to @xmath64 100 . for distances",
    "@xmath65  we have assumed a homogeneous ( @xmath66 ) galaxy distribution . in the range @xmath67 , the smoothing length increases from 15  to about 45 . at first glance , this degradation in resolution might appear worrisome .",
    "we tested the robustness of our results by augmenting our density field with realizations of the small scale structure consistent with the known power spectrum ; the results reported in the following sections were found to be very insensitive to the lack of small scale resolution at large distances .    for the bias function , @xmath48 $ ] ,",
    "we consider three models : an isotropic ( i ) model , where the cr source distribution is purely isotropic , i.e. @xmath48\\equiv1 $ ] ; an unbiased ( ub ) model , where the cr sources trace the galaxy distribution with @xmath48=1+\\delta$ ] ; a biased ( b ) model where the cr source distribution is biased compared to the galaxy distribution with a simple threshold bias , @xmath48=1+\\delta$ ] for @xmath68 and zero otherwise .",
    "the value @xmath69 produces a source distribution which is concentrated near the sgp in a manner very similar to that seen in nearby radio sources ( shaver & pierre 1989 ) .",
    "we therefore adopt @xmath69 as our canonical `` biased '' model .",
    "we generate a specific realization of cr arrival directions for a chosen model by dividing the sky into a set of angular bins ; in each bin we draw the number of sources producing 1 , 2 , etc .",
    "events from poisson distributions with means determined by equation  ( [ sbar ] ) .",
    "the product @xmath70 is fixed by requiring that the mean number of crs produced match the number observed by a particular detector .",
    "since we are interested only in large scale correlations of the cr sources with the galaxy distribution , we can use relatively coarse angular binning .",
    "we have adopted equal area bins of approximately @xmath71 ; this corresponds to the resolution of the density field at 100  and is comparable with the upper limits for deflections caused by inter - galactic magnetic fields . [ the deflection angle for protons is ( @xcite ) @xmath72 for the current upper limit on inter - galactic magnetic field @xmath73 with correlation length @xmath74 , @xmath75 ( @xcite , @xcite ) ] .",
    "the efficiency of cr detectors is usually a function of declination .",
    "relative efficiencies can easily be accounted for by multiplying the mean counts in ( [ sbar ] ) by the appropriate weights . in the case of the fly s eye detector , we model the efficiency as uniform above @xmath76 with no sensitivity at smaller declinations .    having specified the bias model , the only remaining parameter is the current source number density .",
    "we have performed our monte - carlo realizations using two values : @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the high number density corresponds to the number density of bright galaxies .",
    "the low number density was chosen based on the following argument .",
    "the energy of the highest energy event detected by the fly s eye is in excess of @xmath79 ( @xcite ) . since the distance traveled by such",
    "a particle can not exceed @xmath80 ( @xcite ) , its detection implies that at least one cr source exists in the fly s eye field of view out to @xmath80 , implying a source density @xmath81 .",
    "a more reliable lower limit to @xmath26 may be given by considering the probability of observing repeating sources .",
    "as the source number density decreases , individual sources become brighter and , for a given number of detected events , the probability that one source would contribute more than one event increases .",
    "the analysis of  2.1 gives an analytic expression for the probability to observe a repeating source in a given angular bin .",
    "this is shown fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] which gives the probability that repeating sources would be observed ( above an energy @xmath21 ) as a function of cr source density , @xmath26 , for the fly s eye exposure and the isotropic model . from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , an absence of repeaters in the current fly s eye data above @xmath82 at the 90% confidence limit would imply a lower limit of @xmath81 , similar to the lower limit inferred from the highest energy events .",
    "clearly , the number density would be strongly constrained by considering repeating sources once the exposure is increased by a factor of @xmath2 .",
    "figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] present maps of the fluctuations in the mean cr intensity , @xmath83 , for @xmath84 and the unbiased model . also shown are the sgp and the fly s eye field of view for crs with zenith angle @xmath85 .",
    "the map clearly reflects the inhomogeneity of the large - scale galaxy distribution- the over dense cr regions lie in the directions of the `` great attractor '' [ composed of the hydra - centaurus ( @xmath86@xmath87 , @xmath88@xmath89 ) and pavo - indus ( @xmath90@xmath87 , @xmath91@xmath92 ) superclusters ] and the perseus - pisces supercluster ( @xmath93@xmath94 , @xmath95@xmath96 ) .",
    "the main structures of the cr arrival distribution , observable by northern hemisphere detectors such as agasa and the fly s eye , are the overdensity in the perseus - pisces direction and the underdensity along the galactic plane .",
    "a crude estimate of the number of cr events required in order to detect these structures may be obtained as follows . for a given detector exposure the average number of events expected in the under - dense , @xmath97 , region is @xmath98 smaller in the ub model compared to the i model . if the number of expected events in both models is poisson distributed , as would be the case for many faint sources ( @xmath99 ) , then the probability that the i model would be ruled out at a @xmath100 level , assuming that the source distribution is described by the ub model , requires that the number of detected crs , @xmath101 , satisfy ( for a @xmath102 upward fluctuation ) @xmath103 , i.e. @xmath104 . since the @xmath97 region occupies @xmath105 the fly s eye field of view , this corresponds to a total of @xmath106 events .",
    "this number requires an exposure @xmath3 times higher than the current fly s eye exposure , for which @xmath107 events above @xmath108 were detected .",
    "a similar estimate is obtained considering the overdense region in the direction of the perseus - pisces supercluster .    in order to obtain a more accurate estimate of the exposure required to discriminated between the various models ( i , ub",
    ", b ) for the distribution of cr sources , we have considered the distribution of a statistic similar in spirit to @xmath109 , @xmath110 ^ 2\\over n_{l , i}(e ) } \\ . \\label{x}\\ ] ] here @xmath111 is the number of events detected in angular bin @xmath112 and @xmath113 is the average number expected for the i model . for a total of @xmath114",
    "observed crs there would be , on average , 1 event per @xmath115 angular bin , limiting the angular resolution with which the overdensity map can be reconstructed to @xmath116 ( note , that the over / under densities predicted by the ub model are not large ) .",
    "thus , for the calculation of @xmath117 we have grouped the @xmath118 bins into @xmath119 bins . in addition , we have only used the 3 bins for which the ub model predicts the highest overdensity , and the 3 for which the model predicts the lowest underdensity .",
    "these bins cover @xmath120 of the fly s eye field of view , for which @xmath121 in the ub model .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and the arguments of the previous paragraph , that for the ub model the distribution of crs in the remaining @xmath122 of the field of view , for which @xmath123 , could not be discriminated from that expected in the i model for a total of only @xmath114 cr events .",
    "the @xmath124 distributions for the various models are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for @xmath125 and a detector with the fly s eye field of view and exposure for which @xmath126 crs above @xmath108 are detected , corresponding to @xmath2 times the current fly s eye exposure .",
    "the detector efficiency was assumed to be uniform within the field of view ( corresponding to declination @xmath127 ) .",
    "clearly , there is a significant probability that this exposure would allow to discriminate between the models : the probability of ruling out the isotropic model at the @xmath128 level , assuming that the cr sources are distributed as in the unbiased model , is @xmath129% ; the probability for all other combinations ( of assumed / ruled out model ) is @xmath130% .",
    "it is unlikely that the @xmath124 statistic could discriminate between the unbiased and isotropic models for an exposure significantly lower than @xmath131 times the current exposure of the fly s eye detector .",
    "the biased model , however , could be discriminated from the isotropic model with only @xmath132 times the current fly s eye exposure .",
    "@xcite have recently noted a correlation between the arrival directions of @xmath11 cr events detected by the haverah park experiment and the supergalactic plane . using our monte - carlo simulations we have calculated , following @xcite , the probability distribution of the absolute value and rms of the supergalactic latitude , @xmath133 and @xmath134 , and galactic latitude , @xmath135 and @xmath136 , for each of our bias models and for the two values of the source density , @xmath26 .",
    "the declination efficiency was derived from the declination distribution of the published haverah park events@xcite with @xmath137 and zenith angles less than @xmath138 .",
    "the average number of events at each energy was chosen to correspond to that given in @xcite : 27 and 12 events above @xmath139 and @xmath140 respectively .",
    "table  1 presents the averages of @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 obtained from the monte - carlo simulations of the various models , and the probability that a value smaller than the experimental haverah park value is obtained for each model .    in agreement with @xcite",
    ", we find that the probability to obtain the haverah park results assuming an isotropic cr source distribution is very low .",
    "[ the slight differences between our numbers for the isotropic ( i ) model and those in @xcite are due to the fact that we used a declination efficiency map and not the ( unpublished ) declinations of the observed events used in @xcite ] .",
    "however , we find that the probability to obtain the haverah park results is not significantly higher for models where the cr source distribution traces the lss ; thus , contrary to the claim by @xcite , we find that the concentration of the haverah park events towards the sgp is _ not _ strong support for the cr sources tracing the known lss .",
    "it is important to note that for the biased model , where cr sources are restricted to high density regions in a way similar to radio galaxies , the probability to obtain the haverah park results is smaller than for the unbiased one .",
    "this reflects the fact that the superclusters , while concentrated towards the sgp , have offsets above and below the sgp which cause the inferred cr distribution to be less flattened than seen in the haverah park data .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , there is a significant contribution to the flux at @xmath108 from sources at distances @xmath141 , where the resolution of the galaxy density field inferred from the catalogue is fairly poor .",
    "the concentration of the haverah park events toward the sgp might therefore be indicative of lss at low supergalactic latitude which is not seen in the galaxy distribution . in an effort to quantify this",
    ", we inserted an artificial supercluster at @xmath142  in the sgp with mass and size of the shapley supercluster ( raychaudhury _ et al .",
    "this is most likely a worst case scenario since the actual shapley cluster is seen ( albeit outside the haverah park field of view ) at a similar distance in the catalog and it is unlikely that any missed structure would lie precisely in the sgp .",
    "even with such an extreme structure in the sgp , all of the models were unable to reproduce the concentration of the haverah park data at @xmath143% confidence level .",
    "we conclude that the haverah park events either arise from sources concentrated in the sgp which are not probed by the known lss or that there is some unknown systematic error in the positional accuracy of the cr events .",
    "we have shown that , if the distribution of cr sources trace the large scale structure , large exposure cr detectors should clearly reveal anisotropy in the arrival direction distribution of crs above @xmath108 .",
    "the exposure required for a northern hemisphere detector to discriminate between isotropic cr source distribution and an unbiased distribution that traces the lss is approximately @xmath131 times the current fly s eye exposure .",
    "if the cr source distribution is strongly biased , the required exposure is @xmath132 times the current . increasing the exposure by a factor of @xmath131 with existing experiments ( agasa and fly s eye ) , would require @xmath3 years of observation ( taking into account the fact that the agasa experiment triggering was recently improved ) .",
    "the required observation time would be reduced if new , larger , cr experiments become operative : @xmath2 observation - years would be required with the new high resolution fly s eye experiment ( @xcite ) , which is planned to become operative in two years ; less than @xmath4 year of observation would be required if the proposed @xmath5 detectors of the auger project are built ( @xcite ) .",
    "an experiment with full sky coverage , such as the auger experiment , would allow the cr event distribution to be analyzed conveniently in terms of a spherical multipole decomposition . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we show the probability distribution for dipole and quadrupole moments of the cr distribution for a full sky coverage detector with an exposure @xmath144 times the current fly s eye exposure , comparable to the exposure of the auger detectors after a few years of operation . the dipole moment has been defined as @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the angle between the cr position and fixed reference direction , taken to be @xmath147 , while the quadrupole moment is defined as @xmath148 . from the figure ,",
    "it is evident that even these low order statistics are sufficient to discriminate between the models at a high degree of confidence .",
    "moreover , since the various multipole moments are independent , the confidence level can be increased by including higher order moments of the cr distribution .",
    "the anisotropy signal is not sensitive to the currently unknown number density of cr sources ( see figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "we have shown , that a reliable lower limit to the source number density , @xmath26 , may be obtained by considering the probability of observing repeating sources . as the source number density decreases ,",
    "individual sources become brighter and , for a given number of detected events , the probability that one source would contribute more than one event increases . an absence of repeaters in the current fly s eye data above @xmath82 , for example , would imply @xmath81 with 90% confidence limit ( see fig .",

    "our analysis addressed only the 2-dimensional ( angular ) lss information contained in the distribution of cr arrival directions .",
