    "physics of odd - frequency cooper pairs@xcite has been a hot issue since a theoretical paper pointed out the existence of odd - frequency pairs in realistic proximity structures  @xcite .",
    "there are mainly two ways to create the odd - frequency cooper pairs in proximity structures . at first",
    ", spin - mixing due to spin - dependent potential should generate odd - frequency pairs .",
    "the authors of ref .   considered a ferromagnet / metallic - superconductor junction , where the direction of magnetic moment near the interface is spatially inhomogeneous .",
    "the spin - flip scattering in such magnetically inhomogeneous segment produces the odd - frequency spin - triplet @xmath1-wave cooper pairs in the ferromagnet .",
    "this prediction has promoted a number of theoretical studies  @xcite .",
    "manifestations of triplet pairs were recently observed experimentally as a long - range josephson coupling across ferromagnets  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the odd - frequency pair was suggested in proximity structures involving a normal metal attached to an odd - parity spin - triplet superconductor that belongs to the conventional even - frequency symmetry class . the parity - mixing due to inhomogeneity produces the odd - frequency pairs even in this case  @xcite .",
    "the unusual properties of spin - triplet superconducting junctions due to odd - frequency pairs  @xcite were predicted theoretically .",
    "unfortunately , however , we have never had clear scientific evidences of odd - frequency pairs in experiments . this is because physical values focused in experiments have only indirect information of the frequency symmetry .    in a previous paper  @xcite",
    ", we showed that the surface impedance directly reflects the frequency symmetry of cooper pair .",
    "surface impedance @xmath0 represents the dynamic response of cooper pairs to low frequency electromagnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the surface resistance , @xmath3 , corresponds to resistance due to normal electrons .",

    "the positive amplitude of the cooper pair density guarantees a robust relation @xmath5 at low temperatures and at low frequencies .",
    "the validity of the relation @xmath6 , however , is questionable for odd - frequency cooper pairs because the odd - frequency symmetry and _ negative pair density _ are inseparable from each other according to the standard theory of superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "we have considered a a normal metal / superconductor ( ns ) junction where superconductor belongs to spin - triplet odd - parity symmetry .",
    "we have theoretically shown that the odd - frequency cooper pairs in the normal metal lead to the unusual relationship @xmath2 .",
    "therefore observing the relation @xmath2 in experiments can be a very clear and direct evidence which suggests the existence of odd - frequency cooper pairs .",
    "although the detection of such unusual relation is possible these days , the fabrication of a well characterized ns junction using chiral @xmath7-wave spin - triplet superconductor sr@xmath8ruo@xmath9  @xcite is not easy task .",
    "thus we need to discuss a possibility for observing the unusual relationship @xmath2 in another accessible proximity structures .    in this paper",
