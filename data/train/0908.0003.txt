    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) have long been known to vary in luminosity on timescales of years to months or even days ( @xcite ) . variability has played a central role in agn studies . combining the physical size constraints set by rapid variability with the high luminosities of agns",
    "led to the original argument that agns are powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes ( @xcite ) .",
    "variability is used as a reliable method for detecting agns in surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and it is the fundamental basis upon which rests the technique of measuring black hole masses known as reverberation mapping ( @xcite ) .",
    "reverberation mapping is the most successful method employed for measuring the mass of the central black hole in broad emission line agns . rather than relying on spatially resolved observations , as do most studies of black holes in nearby quiescent galaxies ,",
    "reverberation mapping resolves the influence of the black hole in the time domain through spectroscopic monitoring of the continuum flux variability and the delayed response , or `` echo , '' in the broad emission line flux .",
    "the time lag between these changes , @xmath6 , depends on the light - travel time across the broad - line region ( blr ) and is on the order of light days for nearby seyfert galaxies , corresponding to spatial scales of @xmath7pc . combining the radius of the blr , @xmath8 , with the velocity width",
    ", @xmath9 , of the broad emission line gives the virial mass of the central black hole via the simple gravitational relation @xmath10 ( neglecting a factor of order unity ) .    to date",
    ", successful reverberation - mapping studies have been carried out for approximately 36 active galaxies ( compiled by @xcite with additions by @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most important results to come from reverberation mapping is the detection of a correlation between the blr radius and the luminosity of the agn , the @xmath11@xmath12  relationship ( @xcite ) . combining the @xmath11@xmath12  relationship with the simple virial mass equation results in an extremely powerful tool for estimating black hole masses in broad - lined agns from a single epoch of spectroscopy and two simple spectral measurements : the velocity width of a broad emission line , and the continuum luminosity as a proxy for the radius of the blr .",
    "the @xmath11@xmath12  relationship is therefore fundamental to all secondary techniques used to estimate black hole masses in agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and as such , current studies of black holes in agns rest upon the calibration provided by the reverberation mapping sample ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the vast majority of reverberation experiments have investigated black holes with masses in the range @xmath2@xmath13  m@xmath3 .",
    "studies of lower - mass black holes have largely been restricted by the lower luminosities associated with smaller agns , and the few studies that have been carried out have large measurement uncertainties .",
    "it is particularly important to have the correct calibration for agns in the mass range of @xmath14@xmath2  m@xmath3 , as they are at the peak of the local black hole mass distribution function ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular , agns in this mass range",
    "may provide strong constraints on the mass accretion history of the universe through the coupling of the central black hole and the host galaxy , as evidenced by the relationship between black hole mass and bulge luminosity ( the @xmath15  relationship ; e.g. , @xcite ) and the relationship between black hole mass and bulge stellar velocity dispersion ( the @xmath5relationship ; @xcite ) .    with the goal of extending the range of masses probed by reverberation studies , we have carried out a 64-night spectroscopic monitoring campaign with the lick observatory 3-m shane telescope , targeting agns having expected black hole masses in the range @xmath1@xmath2  m@xmath3 .",
    "we report here the h@xmath4 light curves and reverberation analysis for the entire sample of 13 agns included in the lick agn monitoring project ( lamp ) .",
    "for those objects with significant correlations between the h@xmath4 and continuum light curves , of which there were nine , we quantify the time lag between the variations in the light curves and present the derived black hole masses .",
    "we also investigate the time lag behavior as a function of velocity across the h@xmath4 line profile for six of the agns .",
    "we have previously published the h@xmath4 results for one of the objects , arp151 ( mrk40 ; @xcite , hereafter paper i ) , and here we give an update to the results for arp151 based on slight modifications to the data processing , to be consistent with all the results presented here .",
    "the small changes to the measured time lag and derived black hole mass for arp151 are not significant .",
    "details of the target selection and the photometric monitoring campaign are presented by @xcite ( 2009 , hereafter paper ii ) . in short , the sample of agns chosen for this study",
    "is listed in table  [ table : objects ] and is comprised of 12 nearby ( @xmath16 ) agns with estimated black hole masses ( based on single - epoch spectroscopy ) in the range @xmath17@xmath2  m@xmath3 , expected h@xmath4 lags between 520 days , and relatively strong broad - line components to their h@xmath4 lines .",
    "also included as a `` control object '' is ngc5548 , which has 14 years of previous reverberation - mapping data and a well - determined black hole mass of @xmath18  m@xmath3 ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "inclusion of ngc5548 adds extra value to our sample by allowing a direct comparison of our results with those of previous reverberation mapping experiments .",
    "broad - band johnson @xmath19 and @xmath20 monitoring of all 13 agns in the sample was carried out at four telescopes : the 30-inch robotic katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ) , the 2-meter multicolor active galactic nuclei monitoring telescope , the palomar 60-inch telescope , and the 32-inch tenagra ii telescope .",
    "the details of the photometric monitoring are described in paper ii , but we include a summary here .",
    "each of the four telescopes was responsible for monitoring a subset of the sample .",
    "twice - weekly observations of the targets began in early february 2008 , but was increased to nightly monitoring beginning the evening of 2008 march 17 ( ut , both here and throughout ) , about one week before the spectroscopic monitoring began on 2008 march 25 . the photometric light curves mainly follow variations in the continuum flux , and the response of the broad emission lines is delayed relative to changes in the continuum . by starting the photometric monitoring early",
    ", we hoped to ensure that all events at the beginning of the spectroscopic light curves would have associated events in the photometric light curves .",
    "the images were reduced following standard techniques .",
    "the fluxes of the agns were measured through circular apertures as described in paper ii and differential photometry was obtained relative to stars within the fields , which themselves were calibrated to @xcite standard stars .",
    "a simple model of the host galaxy surface brightness was subtracted from each of the agn images to help compensate for the diluting contribution from host - galaxy starlight .",
    "the models did not include a bulge component due to the lack of spatial resolution in the ground - based images , and so represent a lower limit to the true host - galaxy contribution .",
    "as we are interested here in relative flux changes , the absolute scaling of the agn flux in the photometry is not important for the results described in this work .",
    "flux uncertainties were determined through two methods and the larger uncertainty contribution was adopted for each datum . in general , the flux errors from photon statistics were not large enough to account for the overall behavior of the light curves , and instead the uncertainty determined from the average difference between closely spaced pairs of points in each light curve was adopted .",
    "the exceptions were generally nights with poor weather conditions , where the photon - counting statistics provided a larger flux uncertainty .",
    "the @xmath19- and @xmath20-band light curves for each of the 13 agns are tabulated in paper ii .",
    "our spectroscopic campaign was carried out over 64 mostly contiguous nights at the lick observatory 3-m shane telescope between 2008 march 25 and june 1 .",
    "we used the kast dual spectrograph but restricted our observations to the red - side ccd and employed the 600  lines  mm@xmath21 grating with spectral coverage over the range 43007100 , giving a nominal resolution of 2.35pix@xmath21 in the dispersion direction and 078pix@xmath21 in the spatial direction .",
    "spectra were obtained through a 4-wide slit at fixed position angles for each of the objects ( as listed in table  [ table : observ ] ) .",
    "a fixed position angle for each individual object is important to mitigate any apparent variability due to different contributions of starlight from structures within the host galaxy .",
    "the position angles were set to match the average parallactic angle expected for each of the objects throughout the length of the spectroscopic campaign , in an attempt to lessen the effect of atmospheric dispersion @xcite .",
    "the number of nights on which spectra were obtained for each of the objects in our sample ranged from 43 to 51 , with an average of 47 , which is fairly typical given the historic data on spring observing conditions at lick observatory .",
    "exposure times , average airmass , and typical signal - to - noise ratio per pixel in the continuum are also listed in table  [ table : observ ] .",
    "the two - dimensional spectroscopic images were reduced with iraf and an extraction width of 13 pixels ( 9 pixels for mcg-06 - 30 - 15 , to avoid a nearby star ) was applied , resulting in spectra with a 101 ( 70 ) extraction .",
    "sky regions were included on either side of the extracted regions , of width 6 pixels and beginning at a distance of 19 pixels to avoid the vast majority of contribution from the extended host galaxies .",
    "flux calibrations were determined from nightly spectra of standard stars , which typically included feige34 and bd+284211 .    to mitigate the effects of slit losses and variable seeing and transparency , a final , internal calibration of the spectra is required .",
    "we employed the spectral scaling algorithm of @xcite to scale the total flux of the narrow [ ] @xmath22 4959 ,  5007 doublet in each spectrum to match the [ ] flux in a reference spectrum created from the mean of the spectra obtained for each object .",
    "this method accounts for differences in the overall flux scale , as well as small wavelength shifts and small differences in spectral resolution due to variable seeing , and has been shown to result in spectrophotometric accuracies of @xmath23% @xcite .",
    "the adopted absolute scaling of the [ ] @xmath24 line for each object is listed in table  [ table : o3flux ] , along with spectrophotometric [ ] @xmath24 fluxes from the literature for comparison . from the available information ,",
    "it was determined that the night of 2008 april 10 was the only steadily photometric night of the campaign , and provides the absolute [ ] scaling for all the objects in our sample , with other clear nights suffering from haze , moderate to strong winds , or highly variable seeing .",
    "the spectroscopic light curves were measured from the final , calibrated spectra for each object by fitting a local , linear continuum under the h@xmath4 + [ ] emission complex and integrating the h@xmath4 emission - line flux above the fitted continuum .",
    "this technique includes the flux contribution from the narrow h@xmath4 emission line , which is simply a constant offset in the resultant light curves . in the case of ngc5548 ,",
    "the red wing of h@xmath4 extends underneath the [ ] emission lines , so the [ ] lines were removed prior to measuring the h@xmath4 flux . and for ngc6814 , the continuum window to the blue of h@xmath4 had to be placed to the blue of the @xmath25 line as well to avoid contamination from that emission line .",
    "table  [ table : fluxwind ] gives the continuum windows and line integration limits for each object as well as the mean and standard deviation of the h@xmath4 flux .",
    "we also list the mean continuum level as the flux density at @xmath26 .",
    "the h@xmath4 light curves for each of the objects are tabulated in tables  [ table : lc1][table : lc3 ] and presented in figures  14 along with the @xmath19- and @xmath20-band light curves .",
    "statistical properties of the h@xmath4 light curves are listed in table  [ table : variability ] along with the properties of the @xmath19- and @xmath20-band light curves for comparison .",
    "column ( 1 ) lists the object , column ( 2 ) gives the measured feature , and column ( 3 ) lists the number of measurements in each light curve . for our analysis ,",
    "we binned all photometric measurements within 0.1days . columns ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) are the sampling intervals between data points , measured as the mean and median , respectively .",
    "column ( 6 ) gives the mean fractional error , which is based on the comparison of observations that are closely spaced in time .",
    "occasionally , spectra were obtained under poor weather conditions and , in those cases , the uncertainties on the h@xmath4 fluxes are given by photon counting statistics instead .",
    "the `` excess variance '' in column ( 7 ) is computed as    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the variance of the fluxes , @xmath29 is their mean - square uncertainty , and @xmath30 is the mean of the observed fluxes . finally , column ( 8) is the ratio of the maximum to the minimum flux ( @xmath31 ) for each light curve .",
    "for the time - series analysis , we consider both the @xmath19- and @xmath20-band photometric light curves as the driving , continuum light curve . in general",
    ", they have similar sampling over the length of observations .",
    "the variability in the @xmath19 band tends to be somewhat more pronounced than in the @xmath20 band , most likely due to a smaller component of host - galaxy starlight dilution , and is easily seen by comparing the values of @xmath32 and @xmath31 for the @xmath19- and @xmath20-band observations of each object as listed in table  [ table : variability ] . as shown in paper",
    "ii , we find no evidence for a time lag between the variations in the @xmath19 and @xmath20 bands .    to determine the average time lag between variations in the continuum and variations in the h@xmath4 emission - line flux , we follow the standard practice of cross - correlating the light curves .",
    "specifically , we employ the interpolation cross - correlation function method ( @xcite ) with the modifications described by @xcite .",
    "the method measures the cross - correlation function between two light curves twice , first by interpolating between the continuum points , and second by interpolating between the emission - line points .",
    "the average of the two results is the final cross - correlation function ( ccf ) .",
    "following @xcite , each ccf is characterized by the maximum cross - correlation coefficient ( @xmath33 ) , the time delay corresponding to the location of @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , and the centroid of the points about the peak ( @xmath35 ) above some threshold value , typically @xmath36 .    figures",
    "14 show the ccfs for the 13 agns in our sample .",
    "as mentioned above , we cross - correlated the h@xmath4 flux with both the @xmath19- and @xmath20-band light curves , and we show the results of both for comparison .",
    "we also show the auto - correlation functions for the photometric light curves , which , as expected , peak at a time lag of zero days .",
    "four of the objects do not appear to show a significant lag signal in their ccfs .",
    "ic4218 has a broad , flat - topped ( h@xmath4 vs. @xmath19 ) or double - horned ( h@xmath4 vs. @xmath20 ) ccf structure centered around zero lag .",
    "mcg-06 - 30 - 15 shows a noisy ccf profile that appears to be consistent with zero at all lag times .",
    "mrk290 has a very slowly rising and flat - topped ccf profile at positive lag times .",
    "inspection of the h@xmath4 variations in this object does not seem to show an echo of the photometric variations , and there is no h@xmath4 signal in the variable spectrum of mrk290 .",
    "and ic1198 shows a ccf profile that is rather noisy and centered about zero at all lag times , with the largest peak occurring at a lag of @xmath37days .",
    "there does not appear to be any signal from h@xmath4 in the variable spectrum of this object either .",
    "while it is quite simple to determine the lag time between two time series by measuring either @xmath34 or @xmath35 , it is more difficult to quantify the uncertainty in the measured lag time .",
    "the standard procedure is to employ the monte carlo `` flux randomization / random subset sampling '' method described by @xcite .",
    "the method takes @xmath38 random and independent samplings from the @xmath38 points available in the light curves , regardless whether a datum has been sampled already .",
    "the uncertainty for a point that is sampled @xmath39 times is reduced by a factor of @xmath40 , and in general the fraction of points that are not selected in any particular realization is @xmath41 .",
    "this `` random subset sampling '' helps to quantify the amount of uncertainty in the lag time that arises based on the contribution from individual points in the light curve . the flux values in this randomly sampled subset",
    "are then randomly altered by a gaussian deviation of the flux uncertainty .",
    "this `` flux randomization '' accounts for the uncertainty in the measured flux values .",
    "the ccf is calculated for the sampled and modified light curves , and @xmath42 , @xmath35 , and @xmath34 are measured and recorded .",
    "the process is repeated for 1000 realizations , and distributions of correlation measurements are built up .",
    "the means of the cross - correlation centroid distribution and the cross - correlation peak distribution are taken to be @xmath35 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the uncertainties on @xmath35 and @xmath34 are set such that 15.87% of the realizations fall above and 15.87% fall below the range of uncertainties , corresponding to @xmath44 for a gaussian distribution .",
    "table  [ table : tau ] lists the measured lag times and uncertainties for the nine objects with significant h@xmath4 lag signatures in their ccfs .",
    "also listed are the lag times and uncertainties after correction for the time - dilation factor of @xmath45 .",
    "figure  5 shows the mean and root - mean - square ( rms ) spectra in the region around h@xmath4 for the nine objects with significant h@xmath4 lags . for comparison ,",
    "we include in figure  6 the mean spectra of the four objects with weak variability .",
    "the rms spectra in figure  5 show the standard deviation of all the individual spectra relative to the mean spectrum for an object , and are thus useful for visualizing and quantifying the variable components of the spectra .",
    "we also show the narrow - line subtracted mean and rms spectra in figure  5 ( except for mrk142 which appears to have emission blended with the [ ] emission in the mean spectrum ) .",
    "we used the [ ] @xmath24 emission line as a template for the @xmath46 and h@xmath4 narrow lines .",
    "the ratio of [ ] @xmath47/ [ ] @xmath24 was set at 0.34 @xcite , and table  [ table : ratio ] lists the derived ratios of h@xmath4/ [ ] @xmath24 .",
    "the width of the broad h@xmath4 emission line was measured in the narrow - line subtracted mean and rms spectra for each of the objects and is reported as two separate measures : the full - width at half - maximum flux ( fwhm ) and the line dispersion , @xmath48 , which is the second moment of the emission - line profile @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in the line widths are set using a monte carlo random subset sampling method . in this case , from a set of @xmath38 spectra , a random subset of @xmath38 spectra is selected without regard to whether a spectrum has previously been chosen and a mean and rms spectrum are created from the chosen subset .",
    "the fwhm and @xmath48 are measured and recorded , and distributions of line - width measurements are built up over 1000 realizations . the mean and standard deviation of each distribution are taken to be the line width and uncertainty , respectively .    in a slight departure from the methods of @xcite",
    ", we also attempt to quantify the uncertainty from the exact placement of the continuum . for each object , we define a maximum continuum window ( typically 50  wide ) on either side of the h@xmath4 + [ ] complex . for each realization ,",
    "a subset of the continuum window on each side of at least 7 pixels ( 12 ) is randomly selected , from which the local linear continuum is fit . in general",
    "we find that this additional step does not affect the uncertainties of the line widths measured in the rms spectra , but slightly increases the errors from measurements made using the mean spectra .",
    "this is not particularly surprising , as the mean spectra have much higher signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) , so the exact placement of the continuum window defines the specific low - level emission and absorption features from the host - galaxy stellar population that will be included while fitting the continuum .",
    "these same low - level features are not detected in an rms spectrum , and the errors are instead dominated by the specifics of which spectra are included .",
    "finally , we correct the measured line widths for the dispersion of the spectrograph following @xcite . the observed line width , @xmath49 , can be described as a combination of the intrinsic line width , @xmath50 , and the spectrograph resolution , @xmath51 , such that    @xmath52    we take our measurements of the fwhm of [ ] @xmath24 as @xmath49 . given our slit width of 4  and typical seeing of 2  throughout the campaign , the target agns do not fill the entire width of the slit and so we do not measure the resolution from sky lines or arc lamps . instead , we assume that the high - resolution measurements of the widths of [ ] @xmath24 for several of the agns from @xcite are @xmath50 ( listed here in table  [ table : o3width ] after transformation to our adopted units and the observed frame of the galaxy ) .",
    "imaging of a subset of our sample by @xcite shows that the vast majority of the [ ] emission comes from a fairly compact region of @xmath53  in width .",
    "] we are then able to deduce @xmath51 , the fwhm resolution of the spectra ( also listed in table  [ table : o3width ] ) , with which we are able to correct the measurements of the width of the broad h@xmath4 line .",
    "for those objects where measurements are not available from @xcite , we assume a fwhm resolution of 12.5 , which is within the range of measured spectral dispersions tabulated in table  [ table : o3width ] , but slightly less than the median of 13.0  in an attempt to not overcorrect the velocity widths in objects where we do not have a measurement of the intrinsic width of the narrow lines .",
    "the slight spread in measured dispersions is a combination of factors including seeing , guiding , and the angular size of the narrow - line region in each object .",
    "we list the rest - frame , resolution - corrected broad h@xmath4 line width measurements in table  [ table : hbwidth ] , from the mean and the rms spectra of each of the nine objects with significant h@xmath4 lag signatures .",
    "the average ratio of h@xmath4 line widths measured in the mean spectra to those in the rms spectra is @xmath54 for @xmath48 and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 excluding ngc4748 ) for fwhm .",
    "the average ratio of fwhm/@xmath48 is @xmath57 in the mean spectra and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 excluding ngc4748 ) in the rms spectra .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of @xcite that agns with narrow broad - line components ( i.e. , @xmath60kms@xmath21 ) have ratios of fwmh/@xmath48 that are less than the expected value for a gaussian line profile of 2.35 .",
    "it is also worth noting that ngc5548 , which currently has very broad h@xmath4 line widths ( @xmath61kms@xmath21 ) has ratios of fwmh/@xmath62 in both the mean and rms spectra .",
    "determination of black hole masses from reverberation mapping rests upon the assumption that the gravity of the central , supermassive black hole dominates the motions of the gas in the blr .",
    "the existence of a `` virial '' relationship between time lag and line width , @xmath63 , has been clearly shown in ngc5548 @xcite , and has been in seen in numerous other objects ( @xcite ) , upholding this basic assumption .",
    "the black hole mass is determined via the virial equation    @xmath64    where @xmath6 is the mean time delay for the region of interest ( here , the h@xmath4-emitting region ) , @xmath9 is the velocity of gas in that region , @xmath65 is the speed of light , @xmath66 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath67 is a scaling factor of order unity that depends on the detailed geometry and kinematics of the line - emitting region .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that the combination of @xmath68 and @xmath69 provides the most robust measurement of the black hole mass . by comparing the resultant masses derived from several emission lines and independent datasets for the same objects , the combination of @xmath35 and @xmath70 results in the least amount of scatter in the resultant masses of all the combinations possible between the various line width and lag time measures .",
    "for the derived black hole masses presented here , we will therefore adopt the combination of @xmath35 and @xmath71 .",
    "the absolute scaling of reverberation masses , the @xmath67 factor in equation  [ eqn : mbh ] , is currently unknown . rather than assuming a specific value of @xmath67 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and therefore assuming specific physical details of the blr , we instead adopt the scaling factor determined by @xcite of @xmath72 .",
    "this is the average value required to bring the @xmath73 relationship for reverberation - mapped agns into agreement with the @xmath74 relationship determined for local , quiescent galaxies with dynamical mass measurements .",
    "table  [ table : mbh ] lists the black hole masses for the nine objects presented in this work with h@xmath4 reverberation signals .",
    "we list both the `` virial product , '' which assumes that @xmath75 , as well as the adopted black hole mass using the @xcite scaling factor .",
    "figure  7 shows the range of black hole masses currently probed by reverberation mapping .",
    "the new masses determined here ( solid histogram , not including ngc5548 ) lie primarily in the range @xmath14@xmath2  m@xmath3 , in agreement with the expectations from single - epoch estimates , and extending the range of black hole mass coverage by a factor of @xmath76 .    .",
    "ngc5548 has by far the most independent reverberation - mapping datasets of any individual agn . as a result ,",
    "there is known to exist a `` virial '' relationship between the broad - line width and the lag time , which strongly suggests that the motions of the gas in the blr is dominated by a central supermassive object @xcite .",
    "figure  8 shows this relationship for all of the independent h@xmath4 reverberation results for ngc5548 , as well as the relationship for all broad emission lines , including , ] , and h@xmath77 .",
    "the open circles are the results from previous reverberation mapping campaigns , and the filled circle shows the measurements of @xmath35 and @xmath48 for h@xmath4 presented here .",
    "the h@xmath4 time lag presented here is the shortest h@xmath4 lag measured for ngc5548 , and is one of the shortest lags measured for any emission line in ngc5548 .",
    "ngc5548 has been in a very low luminosity state for the past several years ( see @xcite ) , and its current luminosity of @xmath78ergs@xmath21 is only @xmath79% brighter than its lowest observed luminosity state in spring 2005 .",
    "the low luminosity of the agn has resulted in a very broad , low - level , double - peaked h@xmath4 emission - line profile in ngc5548 , which does increase the difficulty of accurately measuring the line width . despite this",
    ", the combination of lag time and line width measured here falls where it is expected in figure  8 .",
    "additionally , we can compare the individual virial products for ngc5548 as determined from each h@xmath4 reverberation dataset .",
    "figure  9 shows the virial product as a function of agn luminosity , with open circles representing the virial product based on @xmath48 as measured in the mean spectrum , and filled circles with @xmath48 from the rms spectrum . while similar to figure  7 of @xcite , the luminosities have been updated with the new host - galaxy corrections of @xcite .",
    "the point denoted as `` year 12 '' is the monitoring dataset from the year 2000 and is known to be very poorly sampled and to yield ambiguous results when the h@xmath4 light curve is cross - correlated with the continuum light curve @xcite .",
    "the virial products from the time lag and line widths presented here are consistent with previous results within the observed scatter .",
    "there does not seem to be any significant trend over @xmath80dex in agn luminosity , meaning that the resultant virial product is not dependent on the luminosity state of the agn .",
    "the agreement between the results for ngc5548 presented here and the results from the previous 14 independent reverberation mapping experiments for this same object shows that reverberation mapping is both repeatable and reliable .",
    "this agreement also shows that there are no systematic biases in the lamp analysis that would otherwise be absent from similar high - quality reverberation mapping experiments .",
    "up to this point , the discussion of the reverberation response for the objects in the lamp sample has centered around the average time lag for the broad emission variability , which is related to the average size of the h@xmath4-emitting blr . however , the average time lag is simply the first moment of the so - called `` transfer function , '' which describes the detailed line response as a function of time and velocity ( see @xcite for a full review ) .    to illustrate a sample of possible expected transfer function behaviors ,",
    "figure  10 shows model transfer functions for three different kinematic states of the blr : ( a ) circular keplerian orbits , ( b ) gravitational free - falling inflow , and ( c ) a constantly accelerated outflow .",
    "the blr geometry and radiation parameters are the same for each model : the emission is restricted to a biconical structure with a semi - opening angle of 30  and an inclination of 20 , such that the observer is inside the beam .",
    "the line emission is enhanced for clouds at smaller radii , and is partially anisotropic with enhanced radiation in the direction of the source .",
    "each resulting model is a physically motivated and relatively plausible , although likely simplified , model of an agn blr ( for additional models , see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while the details of the transfer function and emission line profile depend on the exact geometry and line emission mechanics in the model , the overall behavior for each kinematic state does not really change : blr clouds with circular orbits produce a symmetric response around zero velocity , while inflow produces longer lag times in the blueshifted emission and outflow produces the opposite , or longer lags in the redshifted emission . therefore , recovery of the transfer function can be an extremely powerful tool for discriminating between plausible models for the blr and is , in fact , the immediate goal of reverberation mapping experiments .",
    "however , achieving this goal is technically and observationally challenging .",
    "several techniques have been developed in an attempt to grapple with the technical difficulties , including the maximum entropy method ( mem ; @xcite ) , subtractively optimized local averages @xcite , and regularized linear inversion @xcite .",
    "reverberation datasets are limited in sampling duration and generally irregularly sampled , which , coupled with flux uncertainties that are usually only a factor of a few smaller than the flux variability amplitude , has placed severe limitations on past attempts at transfer function recovery .",
    "a partially recovered transfer function for the  region of ngc4151 was hampered by extremely strong absorption in the line core , but perhaps shows some evidence for radial infall @xcite .",
    "@xcite explored the behavior of several optical emission lines in the spectrum of mrk110 and found possible indications for radial outflow .",
    "unfortunately , these and the few other published attempts in the past have yielded notoriously ambiguous results , a fact which is best illustrated by the analyses of the _ hst _ dataset for ngc5548 by several independent groups . each of the studies concluded by favoring a different and conflicting model of the emitting gas in the blr of ngc5548 : no radial motion @xcite , some radial infall @xcite , and radial outflow ( @xcite ) , and all of these conclusions were based on analysis of _ the same data . _    failure to achieve the goal of recovering a full",
    ", unambiguous transfer function has led to more stringent observational requirements for reverberation mapping experiments , including higher and more regular sampling rates , longer sampling durations , and higher spectral resolution and s / n requirements for each of the individual spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "all of these requirements were carefully considered while planning the lamp observations , although past difficulties and the relatively low luminosities of the target agns did not immediately promote transfer function recovery as a main goal of this project .",
    "because a full analysis of the reverberation data presented here using the mem or other techniques is beyond the scope of this paper , we instead investigated whether there appeared to be any strong signals of velocity - resolved time lag information in the lamp datasets .",
    "for the six objects with the clearest average time lag signatures , we measured the average lag time as a function of velocity by creating light curves from the h@xmath4 emission flux in several ( typically four ) equal variable - flux bins across the line profile .",
    "each of these light curves was then cross - correlated with the @xmath19-band photometric light curve using the methods described in section  3.1 .",
    "we discuss the details for the six objects below .",
    "[ [ sbs1116583a ] ] sbs1116 + 583a + + + + + + + + + + + +    while the rms spectrum of this object is rather noisy , there is a clear signature of h@xmath4 variability .",
    "the h@xmath4 line was divided up into four velocity bins , two on the blueshifted side and two on the redshifted side , with each bin containing @xmath81 the variable h@xmath4 flux .",
    "figure  11 shows the average lag time for each of these bins as a function of bin velocity relative to the line center .",
    "the lag times in the wings of the emission line are not consistent with the measured lag time in the line core , and the profile shows a distinct , symmetric pattern around the line center , as would be expected from a simple model of blr gas in circular orbits .    [ [ arp151 ] ] arp151 + + + + + +    a similar analysis for arp151 was published in paper  i , and here we have updated the analysis to include the slight changes in the data processing .",
    "the result is that figure  12 is not significantly different from figure  4 of paper  i , and the lag time as a function of velocity in the blr of arp151 shows a significantly asymmetric profile , with longer lags in the blueshifted gas , and shorter lags in the redshifted gas .",
    "this pattern is consistent with the expectations from a simple gravitational infall model .    [ [ mrk1310 ] ] mrk1310 + + + + + + +    in the case of mrk1310 , figure  13 is rather ambiguous .",
    "there is a hint of slightly longer lag times in the line core ; however , all of the lags measured in the four velocity bins are consistent with a single value , within the errors .",
    "this particular structure is likely consistent with circularly orbiting gas , as there does not seem to be any evidence for a strong redward or blueward asymmetry that would imply radial motion .",
    "[ [ ngc4748 ] ] ngc4748 + + + + + + +    examination of figure  14 shows that there could be evidence for an outflow in the blr of ngc4748 . the extremely broad shape of the cross - correlation functions for the h@xmath4 flux in this object ( see figure  1 ) combined with the relatively low - level flux variations results in rather large uncertainties for the measured lag times in this object .",
    "each of the four velocity bins has a lag time that is consistent within @xmath82 of the lag times measured for the other bins , and so the significance of the velocity - resolved structure for ngc4748 is not clear .",
    "[ [ ngc5548 ] ] ngc5548 + + + + + + +    the current low - luminosity state of ngc5548 has resulted in a very low , broad h@xmath4 line profile which extends under the [ ] doublet .",
    "as the [ ] lines in this object are quite strong , we attempted to subtract them from each spectrum using a very localized linear continuum ( which actually includes the red wing of the h@xmath4 profile ) before creating the light curves for the four velocity bins .",
    "only the most redward velocity bin is affected by the [ ] lines , and so the measured lag time for that bin may be somewhat suspect .",
    "the average lag time for each bin is shown in figure  15 , where there does not seem to be an ordered behavior . in this object",
    "as well , each of the measured lag times is generally consistent with the others within the errors , rendering interpretation as somewhat ambiguous .",
    "[ [ ngc6814 ] ] ngc6814 + + + + + + +    the lag structure for ngc6814 as a function of velocity is shown in figure  16 , which again demonstrates that the lag time measured for each velocity bin is consistent with a constant value , although there is a slight preference for longer lag times in the line core than the wings .",
    "this behavior is most likely consistent with gas in circular orbits .",
    "although several of the objects examined here and presented in figures  1116 show somewhat ambiguous or flat time lag behavior as a function of velocity , both sbs1116 and arp151 seem to show clear , and yet completely different , behaviors .",
    "the h@xmath4 response in sbs1116 seems to be consistent with simple , circularly orbiting gas , while gravitational infall seems to be the simplest picture for the h@xmath4 response in arp151 .",
    "the different behaviors of lag time as a function of velocity for these two objects may be a clue that blr structure is very diverse from one object to another , even possibly an evolutionary effect .",
    "as such , sbs1116 and arp151 are two excellent targets for further and more detailed analysis using the mem or other techniques listed above .    while we plan to pursue recovery of full transfer functions for sbs1116 and arp151 , we also plan to further examine the situation for the other objects in our sample and determine whether the perceived ambiguity in the velocity - resolved behavior is real or merely a product of the simple analysis employed here .",
    "inspection of the mean time lags in figure  10a shows that the longer lags in the emission - line core differ from the shorter lags in the wings by only @xmath8312@xmath84 .",
    "the addition of typical observational noise to this model could conceivably alter the simplified behavior in figure  10a so that the red crosses are all consistent with a single value , exactly as is seen for several of the objects here such as mrk1310 and ngc6814 .",
    "recovery of a velocity - resolved transfer function for any of these objects could place stringent limits on the @xmath67 factor in the determination of the black hole mass for that particular object .",
    "there is no reason to expect that the @xmath67 value is the same from object to object , and differing @xmath67 values in individual objects may be the main source of scatter in the agn @xmath5  relationship ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath30 of 5.5 employed in section  3.3 is empirically determined and does not assume any specific details of the blr geometry or kinematics , other than the dominance of the black hole s gravity . as this population average value has been shown to remove any bias in the sample of reverberation masses when compared to dynamical masses in quiescent galaxies , it is still appropriate to use at this time , even though an individual object s @xmath67 factor may differ .",
    "we hope that further analysis of the velocity - resolved information in the lamp objects may begin to set constraints on the @xmath67 factor for individual objects .",
    "we have presented the h@xmath4 emission - line light curves and reverberation analysis for the 13 agns included in the lamp sample .",
    "we measure h@xmath4 time lags relative to variations in the continuum flux , which are related to the average sizes of the h@xmath4 blrs , and we derive black hole masses for the nine objects which display significant time lag signatures .",
    "in addition , we also explore the velocity - resolved time lag behavior in 6 objects and find that the blr in sbs1116 seems to be consistent with a simple model of blr gas in circular orbits , while the blr in arp151 seems to be consistent with gravitationally infalling gas .",
    "more work is necessary to determine what constraints may be set on the physical parameters of the blr in these two objects , as well as whether any constraints may be set for other objects in the sample , although it seems clear that blr parameters may be very diverse among type 1 agns .",
    "strong reverberation signals are also seen in other broad emission lines for the objects in this sample , including h@xmath77 , h@xmath85 and , and future work will focus on the reverberation signals in these emission lines .",
    "we have a _ hubble space telescope _",
    "cycle 17 program ( go-11662 , pi : bentz ) to image the host galaxies of the agns in the lamp sample , which will allow correction for the host - galaxy starlight contribution to the continuum luminosity for each object , and will allow us to extend the low - luminosity end of the h@xmath4 @xmath11@xmath12  relationship , as well as the agn @xmath15relationship .",
    "we also have new measurements of the bulge stellar velocity dispersion for most of the objects in this sample , which will allow us to extend the agn @xmath5  relationship and explore any updates to the population average @xmath30 value in the black hole mass determinations .",
    "finally , near - infrared photometric monitoring data for a subset of the objects in this sample will allow determination of the reverberation response of the dust torus in those objects ( e.g. , @xcite )",

    "<S> we have recently completed a 64-night spectroscopic monitoring campaign at the lick observatory 3-m shane telescope with the aim of measuring the masses of the black holes in 12 nearby ( @xmath0 ) seyfert  1 galaxies with expected masses in the range @xmath1@xmath2  m@xmath3 and also the well - studied nearby active galactic nucleus ( agn ) ngc5548 . </S>",
    "<S> nine of the objects in the sample ( including ngc5548 ) showed optical variability of sufficient strength during the monitoring campaign to allow for a time lag to be measured between the continuum fluctuations and the response to these fluctuations in the broad h@xmath4 emission . </S>",
    "<S> we present here the light curves for all the objects in this sample and the subsequent h@xmath4 time lags for the nine objects where these measurements were possible . the h@xmath4 lag time is directly related to the size of the broad - line region in agns , and by combining the h@xmath4 lag time with the measured width of the h@xmath4 emission line in the variable part of the spectrum , we determine the virial mass of the central supermassive black hole in these nine agns . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute calibration of the black hole masses is based on the normalization derived by @xcite , which brings the masses determined by reverberation mapping into agreement with the local @xmath5relationship for quiescent galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the time lag response as a function of velocity across the h@xmath4 line profile for six of the agns . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of four leads to rather ambiguous results with relatively flat time lags as a function of velocity . </S>",
    "<S> however , sbs1116 + 583a exhibits a symmetric time lag response around the line center reminiscent of simple models for circularly orbiting broad - line region ( blr ) clouds , and arp151 shows an asymmetric profile that is most easily explained by a simple gravitational infall model . </S>",
    "<S> further investigation will be necessary to fully understand the constraints placed on physical models of the blr by the velocity - resolved response in these objects . </S>"
