    "saturation of density and binding energy , one of the fundamental properties of atomic nuclei , underlies a liquid - drop approach described by a weizs \" acker - bethe mass formula @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the nuclear binding energy , @xmath5 is the volume energy , @xmath6 is the symmetry energy , @xmath7 is the surface energy , and @xmath8 is the coulomb energy .",
    "the sum @xmath9 corresponds to the saturation energy of uniform nuclear matter .",
    "since matter in nuclei is a strongly interacting system , it remains a challenging theoretical problem to understand the nuclear matter equation of state ( eos ) through microscopic calculations that utilize a model of the nuclear force duly incorporating low - energy two - nucleon scattering data and properties of light nuclei @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is not straightforward to empirically clarify the eos , although constraints on the eos from nuclear masses and radii ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , observables in heavy - ion collision experiments performed at intermediate and relativistic energies ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the isoscalar giant monopole resonance in nuclei ( e.g. , ref .  @xcite ) and even x - ray observations of isolated neutron stars @xcite are available . in this work",
    "we will consider such constraints from nuclear masses and radii .",
    "the eos of bulk nuclear matter is a function of nucleon density @xmath10 and proton fraction @xmath11 , which are related to the neutron and proton number densities @xmath12 and @xmath13 as @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we may generally express the energy per nucleon near the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter as @xcite @xmath16\\alpha^2 . \\label{eos0}\\ ] ] here @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath2 are the saturation energy , the saturation density and the incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter , @xmath0 is the symmetry energy @xmath19 at @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the density symmetry coefficient , and @xmath22 is the neutron excess .",
    "as the neutron excess increases from zero , the saturation point moves in the density versus energy plane .",
    "this movement is determined mainly by the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 associated with the density - dependent symmetry energy @xmath19 @xcite . up to second order in @xmath23 , the saturation energy @xmath24 and density @xmath25",
    "are given by @xmath26 and @xmath27 the slope , @xmath28 , of the saturation line near @xmath29 @xmath30 is thus expressed as @xmath31    derivation of @xmath1 and @xmath0 from nuclear observables is generally obscured by the interfacial and electrostatic properties . among the observables ,",
    "the masses and root - mean - square radii of nuclei , which are controlled mainly by the bulk properties , are expected to be good tracers of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "this expectation was stressed by an earlier investigation @xcite based on two macroscopic nuclear models .",
    "such macroscopic models are reliable in a range of neutron excess , @xmath32 , and mass number , @xmath33 . in this range",
    "the neutron separation energy that can be evaluated from a weizs \" acker - bethe mass formula is greater than 2 mev , allowing us to preclude the possibility of neutron halo formation expected at large neutron excess ( or small separation energy ) . in constraining the eos from masses and radii of nuclei of neutron excess @xmath32 and mass number @xmath33 within the framework of the macroscopic models ,",
    "systematic study allowing for uncertainties in the eos parameters is indispensable .    in this paper",
    "we thus explore a systematic way of extracting @xmath1 and @xmath0 from empirical masses and radii of nuclei , together with the parameters , @xmath18 , @xmath17 and @xmath2 , characterizing the saturation of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "we first set an expression for the energy of uniform nuclear matter , which reduces to the phenomenological form ( [ eos0 ] ) in the limits of @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xmath36 .",
    "using this energy expression within a simplified version of the extended thomas - fermi approximation , which permits us to determine the macroscopic features of the nuclear ground state , we calculate charges , charge radii and masses of @xmath37-stable nuclei . comparing these calculations with empirical values allows us to derive the optimal parameter set for various values of the slope @xmath28 and the incompressibility @xmath2 .",
    "we thus find a strong correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the next step is to calculate root - mean - square charge and matter radii of more neutron - rich nuclei that are expected to be produced in future radioactive ion beam facilities .",
    "the results suggest that the density symmetry coefficient @xmath1 may be constrained from possible systematic data on the matter radii in a way nearly independent of the poorly known @xmath2 , while the slope @xmath28 being deducible as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "we finally discuss an empirically allowed region in the space of the parameters characterizing the eos ( [ eos0 ] ) .    in section [ sec : macro ]",
    "we construct a macroscopic model of nuclei .",
    "optimization associated with fitting to empirical data for nuclei on the smoothed @xmath37-stability line is illustrated in section [ sec : opt ] . in section [ sec : radii ] we calculate matter and charge radii of unstable nuclei .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "numerical tables are given in the appendix .",
    "in constructing a macroscopic nuclear model , we begin with the expression for the bulk energy per nucleon @xcite , @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the potential energy densities for symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter , and @xmath41 is the neutron mass .",
    "( replacement of the proton mass @xmath42 by @xmath41 in the proton kinetic energy makes only a negligible difference . ) for the later purpose of roughly describing the nucleon distribution in a nucleus , we incorporate into the potential energy densities ( [ vs ] ) and ( [ vn ] ) a low density behaviour @xmath43 as expected from a contact two - nucleon interaction .",
    "note , however , that we will focus on the eos of nearly symmetric nuclear matter near the saturation density .",
    "we will thus determine the parameters included in eqs .",

    ".    in the limit of @xmath44 and @xmath35 @xmath45 , expression ( [ eos1 ] ) reduces to the usual form ( [ eos0 ] ) according to @xmath46 @xmath47n_0 ^ 4 , \\label{p0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 equation ( [ sat ] ) comes from the fact that the density derivative of the energy per nucleon at @xmath20 and @xmath29 @xmath30 vanishes due to the saturation .",
    "note that the five relations ( [ s0])([sat ] ) are not sufficient to determine the six parameters @xmath51 , and that the parameter @xmath52 , which controls the eos of matter at large neutron excess and high density , has little effect on the saturation properties of nearly symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "we will thus set @xmath52 as a typical value 1.58632 @xmath53 , which was obtained by one of the authors @xcite , and determine the other parameters from the empirical radii and masses of stable nuclei .",
    "we now proceed to describe a spherical nucleus of proton number @xmath54 and mass number @xmath55 within the framework of a simplified version of the extended thomas - fermi theory @xcite .",
    "we first write the total energy of a nucleus as a function of the density distributions @xmath56 and @xmath57 according to @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the bulk energy , @xmath60 is the gradient energy with an adjustable constant @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the coulomb energy , and @xmath63 is the neutron number . here we ignore shell and pairing effects .",
    "we also neglect the contribution to @xmath64 from the gradient of the proton fraction @xmath11 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eg ] ) ] ; this contribution makes only a little difference even in the description of extremely neutron - rich nuclei , as clarified in the context of neutron star matter @xcite .",
    "the energy ( [ e ] ) , once optimized , can be mapped onto a weizs \" acker - bethe mass formula of the form ( [ wb ] ) via @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the inhomogeneity contribution to the bulk energy @xmath67 , and @xmath68 ( @xmath69 with the liquid - drop radius @xmath70 ) denotes that to the coulomb energy @xmath71 .",
    "these inhomogeneity contributions arise from the fact that matter in a nucleus is compressible .",
    "we remark that in equilibrium with respect to nuclear size , @xmath72 holds @xcite . combining this relation with the well - known equilibrium condition for the liquid - drop size , @xmath73 , and with @xmath74",
    ", we find a simple relation , @xmath75 , for an equilibrium nuclide .    for the present purpose of examining the macroscopic properties of nuclei such as masses and radii , it is sufficient to characterize the neutron and proton distributions for each nucleus by the central densities , radii and surface diffuseness different between neutrons and protons , as in ref .",
    "we thus assume the nucleon distributions @xmath76 @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the distance from the center of the nucleus , as @xmath79 ^ 3 ,           & \\mbox{$r < r_i,$ } \\\\               \\\\           0\\ ,           & \\mbox{$r\\geq r_i.$ }   \\end{array } \\right . \\label{ni}\\ ] ] here @xmath80 roughly represents the nucleon radius , @xmath81 the relative surface diffuseness , and @xmath82 the central number density .",

    "in addition to the present results ( crosses ) , the skyrme - hartree - fock predictions [ dots except for siii ( square ) ] and the tm1 prediction ( triangle ) are plotted . in ( c ) , the thin lines are lines of constant @xmath28 .",
    "for fixed mass number @xmath55 , we then optimize the energy ( [ e ] ) with respect to the parameters @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",

    "@xcite ) . for fixed slope @xmath28 and incompressibility @xmath2",
    ", such a comparison can be made by a usual least squares fitting , which gives rise to an optimal set of the parameters @xmath88@xmath52 and @xmath61 . here , we set @xmath28 and @xmath2 as @xmath90 mev @xmath91 mev @xmath53 and 180 mev @xmath92 mev ; the numerical results for @xmath18 , @xmath17 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath61 are tabulated in the appendix .",

    "we also find that the charge radii depend only weakly on @xmath28 , a feature consistent with the prediction made in ref .",

    "differences of the root - mean - square matter radii of ni and sn isotopes , @xmath120 , from those calculated for @xmath121 mev @xmath53 and @xmath122 mev ( upper panels ) and for @xmath123 mev and @xmath122 mev ( lower panels ) .",
    "the thin curves in the lower panels are from formulas ( [ rpfit ] ) and ( [ rnfit ] ) .",
    "several remarks , however , are needed here .",
    "first , it is to be noted that the experimental matter radii that can be derived from measurements of interaction cross sections @xcite and elastic scattering of protons and alpha particles @xcite depend strongly on treatment of the optical potential , in contrast to the charge radii that can be determined from elastic electron scattering @xcite , muonic x - ray experiments @xcite and isotope - shift measurements @xcite .",
    "this dependence contributes to intrinsic uncertainties in the derived matter radii , which are typically of order or greater than @xmath124 fm @xcite .",
    "second , we recall that the present calculations of the radii @xmath108 and @xmath107 ignore the tails of the nucleon distributions arising from quantum - mechanical effects ; the absence of such tails tends to reduce the radii .",
    "third , there are uncertainties in the calculated radii due to the absence of shell and pairing effects in the present macroscopic models . these models , which are fitted to the charge radii of nuclei on the _ smoothed _ @xmath37 stability line , provide the proton - closed - shell nuclei , ni and sn , with larger charge radii than the empirical values , as shown in fig .",
    "fourth , we can see from the lower panels of fig .  4 that with @xmath2 increased and @xmath28 fixed , the matter radii @xmath108 increase , a feature that prevents a clear derivation of @xmath28 from @xmath108 .    such @xmath2 dependence of the matter radii @xmath108 is due mainly to the @xmath2 dependence of the saturation density , @xmath25 , given by eq .",
    "( [ ns ] ) . for fixed @xmath28 , the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath25 is dominated by @xmath18 , which increases with decreasing @xmath2 as in fig .",
    "1d . generally , this increase in @xmath18 tends to increase the inner nucleon densities ( see the lower panels of fig .  3 ) and hence reduce the radii @xmath108 .",
    "note , however , that there is an opposite effect of @xmath2 on @xmath108 .",
    "this effect comes from the fact that a significant part of the nucleons are present in the deepest region of the nuclear surface where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are peaked . in this region ,",
    "the nucleon densities begin to drop in such a way that with decreasing @xmath2 , the surface diffuses further away .",
    "this diffuseness , which can also be seen from the lower panels of fig .  3 ,",
    "is consistent with the results from microscopic nuclear models @xcite .    a cancellation between those counteracting effects is favoured for the purpose of deriving information about the saturation properties in a way independent of @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out that better cancellation can be achieved if we calculate , as in the lower panels of fig .  6 , the matter radii of ni and sn isotopes for the eos parameters optimized under fixed @xmath1 rather than @xmath28 .",
    "the charge radii likewise calculated are also nearly independent of @xmath2 . on the other hand , under fixed @xmath2 , the dependence of the matter and charge radii on @xmath1 , as depicted in the upper panels of fig .",
    "6 , is the same as that on @xmath28 .",
    "these results from fig .",
    "6 may open an opportunity to empirically determine the density symmetry coefficient @xmath1 from the isotopic dependence of matter radii .",
    "same as fig .  4 for combinations of @xmath127 , 50 , 80 mev and @xmath119 , 230 , 360 mev .",
    "fig .  7 . the root - mean - square neutron ( dots ) and proton ( crosses ) radii of @xmath128ni , @xmath129ni , @xmath130sn and @xmath131sn for the eos parameter sets tabulated in table a.1 .",
    "the solid and dotted lines are from formulas ( [ rnfit ] ) and ( [ rpfit ] ) , respectively .",
    "the lower panels of fig .",
    "5 depict the matter radii of ni and sn isotopes calculated for various combinations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 relative to those calculated for @xmath123 mev and @xmath122 mev . as can be seen from these panels , @xmath2-induced uncertainties in the matter radii at constant @xmath1",
    "are limited to the order of @xmath155 fm in the neutron - rich side , small enough for the @xmath1 dependence of the matter radii to be seen clearly .",
    "this may play a role in determining @xmath1 from measurements of the matter radii .",
    "note , however , that possible data on matter radii for isotopes of a specific element would be insufficient to determine the density symmetry coefficient @xmath1 , as inferred from the differences between the empirical and calculated charge radii shown for ni and sn in fig .  6 . in view of such differences as well as intrinsic uncertainties in the matter radii that can be deduced from proton and alpha - particle elastic scattering data , systematics of the isotopic dependence of matter radii would be required .",
    "it is interesting to note that the difference between the neutron and proton radii increases with increasing @xmath1 in a way dependent on neutron excess but almost independent of @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "this leads us to study the isotopic dependence of neutron skin thickness in order to derive the density symmetry coefficient @xmath1 .",
    "the previous investigation @xcite has already suggested the possibility that the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter will be probed by future detection of neutron skin thickness in unstable neutron - enriched nuclei .",
    "however , the neutron skin structure depends strongly on the eos of nuclear matter at large neutron excess and low density @xcite , which is empirically hard to determine .",
    "moreover , the fact @xcite that the neutron skin thickness is thermodynamically relevant to the dependence of the surface tension on neutron excess complicates an extraction of the bulk properties of asymmetric nuclear matter ; the connection between the surface and bulk properties remains to be clarified .",
    "we will elsewhere reinvestigate how the neutron skin thickness is phenomenologically related to the eos of nearly symmetric nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have derived the relations between the parameters characterizing the eos of nearly symmetric nuclear matter from experimental data on radii and masses of stable nuclei .",
    "we have found the linear relation ( [ s0p0 ] ) between the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 associated with the symmetry energy .",
    "it is interesting to regard the band structure on the @xmath2 versus @xmath1 plane ( see fig .",
    "1c ) as an empirically allowed region of @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "future systematic measurements of the root - mean - square matter radii of unstable neutron - rich nuclei may narrow the allowed region in such a way as to fix @xmath1 almost independently of @xmath2 .",
    "once @xmath1 is determined , the slope @xmath28 would be given as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "it is instructive to note that the incompressibility was estimated to be @xmath156 mev from the observations of the giant monopole resonances @xcite .",
    "this estimate can stringently limit the allowed region , although it is model - dependent in the sense that it involves microscopic calculations of the resonance energies from a specific model of the effective nucleon - nucleon interactions @xcite .",

    "<S> we examine relations among the parameters characterizing the phenomenological equation of state ( eos ) of nearly symmetric , uniform nuclear matter near the saturation density by comparing macroscopic calculations of radii and masses of stable nuclei with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the eos parameters of interest here are the symmetry energy @xmath0 , the symmetry energy density - derivative coefficient @xmath1 and the incompressibility @xmath2 at the normal nuclear density . </S>",
    "<S> we find a constraint on the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath1 from the empirically allowed values of the slope of the saturation line ( the line joining the saturation points of nuclear matter at finite neutron excess ) , together with a strong correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in the light of the uncertainties in the values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 , we macroscopically calculate radii of unstable nuclei as expected to be produced in future facilities . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the matter radii depend strongly on @xmath1 while being almost independent of @xmath2 , a feature that will help to determine the @xmath1 value via systematic measurements of nuclear size .    </S>",
