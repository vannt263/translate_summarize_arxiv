    "this proposal has the following advantages : ( i ) the ghz state preparation does not require step - by - step control , which involves only one operation for entangling all qubits and a few basic operations for entangling the intra - cavity qubits ; ( ii ) the entanglement is prepared without exciting the cavity photons , and thus the decoherence induced by cavity decay and the effect of unwanted inter - cavity crosstalk on the operation are greatly suppressed ; ( iii ) because none of the intra - cavity qubits is excited during the operation , decoherence from the qubits is much reduced ; ( iv ) more interestingly , this proposal can in principle be used to implement a ghz state for _ an arbitrary number _ of qubits distributed in multiple cavities by using a single coupler qubit , which is important for the future realization of large - scale qip ; and ( v ) we further stress that this proposal is quite general and can be used for other kinds of qubits , such as atoms , nv centers , and quantum dots .",
