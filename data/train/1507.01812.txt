    "deformation quantization is one approach to encapsulating the algebraic aspects of observables in a quantum mechanical system .",
    "more precisely , the poisson algebra of classical observables is deformed to an associative algebra of quantum observables ; the idea goes back to the work of bayen , flato , fronsdal , lichnerowicz , and sternheimer @xcite . by constructing a trace map on the algebra of quantum observables ,",
    "correlation functions are defined . in the early 1990s  using this paradigm  an algebraic analogue of the atiyah - singer index theorem was established by fedosov @xcite and jointly by nest and tsygan @xcite . beyond an analogy , nest and tsygan",
    "recover the atiyah - singer index theorem ( as well as the index theorems of connes and moscovici ) from the algebraic index theorem @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that deformation quantization and the algebraic index theorem naturally arise via bv quantization .",
    "we provide a purely differential geometric enhancement of the construction of fedosov which is governed by an underlying bv quantization of a one - dimensional chern - simons theory .",
    "the existence of deformation quantizations is highly nontrivial . in the general setting where the classical observables are given by functions on a poisson manifold , existence of a quantization",
    "was established by kontsevich via the celebrated formality theorem @xcite ; kontsevich provides an expression of the associative star product in terms of feynman diagrams .",
    "interestingly , the one dimensional ( quantum mechanical ) nature of this deformation quantization is realized via the boundary of the two dimensional poisson sigma model on the disk @xcite . in the symplectic case ,",
    "the existence was first proved by de wilde and lecomte @xcite .",
    "later on , fedosov @xcite established a beautifully simple differential geometric approach by constructing a flat structure on the weyl bundle .",
    "in addition to fedosov s geometric approach , trace maps in deformation quantization are often constructed via explicit ( algebraic ) computations in hochschild / cyclic homology ; this is the strategy employed in @xcite , as well as by feigin , felder , shoiket @xcite and dolgushev , rubtsov@xcite .    in this paper , our constructions",
    "are firmly rooted in the world of differential geometry ; in particular , we operate within the realm of bundles of weyl algebras as originally proposed by fedosov for a symplectic manifold @xmath0 . we extend fedosov s construction to a flat structure on the bundle of bv algebras , thereby providing the tools of bv integration . fixing a lagrangian super - submaninfold",
    "( see ) yields naturally a bv integration ( definition [ defn : bvint ] ) and a trace map ( definition [ defn : trace ] ) @xmath1 \\to { \\mathbb{r}}((\\hbar)).\\ ] ] the algebraic index theorem alluded to above , is recovered by computing the partition function , i.e. , the trace of the constant function 1 , @xmath2 in this expression @xmath3 $ ] classifies the moduli of deformation quantizations of the poisson algebra @xmath4 .",
    "our construction is motived by a one - dimensional ( perturbative ) chern - simons theory ( this is the content of section 3 ) .",
    "it can be viewed as the aksz formulation of the one - dimensional sigma model in a neighborhood of the constant maps @xcite .",

    "integration over @xmath7 induces a symplectic pairing on @xmath11 of cohomology degree @xmath12 and the classical action functional is then obtained via the aksz formalism @xcite . to any symplectic",
    "manifold @xmath13 we can associate such an @xmath9-algebra @xmath14 and we focus on this geometric setting . in order to quantize this system , we follow a convenient , rigorous formulation of perturbative quantization developed by costello @xcite .",
    "this requires solving an effective quantum master equation ( which may introduce further quantum corrections to the classical chern - simons functional ) .    in our setting",
    ", the solutions of the quantum master equation can be described in terms of fedosov s deformation quantization .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath15 be a sympletic connection on the symplectic manifold @xmath13 .",
    "fedosov showed that the curving of @xmath15 can be made flat on the weyl bundle @xmath16 over @xmath13 if modified by `` quantum correction , '' which he calls an  abelian connection . \" in this picture , the quantum observables are simply realized as the flat sections of the weyl bundle . our main result ( theorem [ thm - fedosov - qme ] , theorem [ thm : qme = fedosov s equation ] ) establishes the following correspondence . @xmath17",
    "one immediate corollary of the correspondence above is our ability to quantize our theory perturbatively to all loops ( all orders of @xmath18 ) .",
    "in particular , theorem [ thm : qme = fedosov s equation ] allows us to solve the all - loop quantum corrections exactly . in the literature , there is a simplified situation as described in @xcite called cotangent theory in the sense of @xcite . in that theory ,",
    "quantum corrections terminate at 1-loop , and it can be viewed as the semi - classical model of our theory .",
    "see also @xcite for a perspective of one - dimensional chern - simons in the vein of atiyah and segal .",
    "in @xcite , costello and gwilliam developed an observable theory within the framework of perturbative quantum field theory .",
    "in this theory , solutions of the quantum master equation naturally provide quantum deformations of the algebra of classical observables . from the correspondence",
    "above , one would expect that fedosov s quantization via an abelian connection would agree with the corresponding quantization of observables in our one - dimensional chern - simons theory .",
    "this is indeed the case as we explicitly verify in section [ section - observable ] .    by realizing the deformation quantization via such an explicit quantum field theory we obtain our differential geometric constructions outlined above : the observables have the structure of factorization algebra , on which renormalization group flow ( in the sense of @xcite )",
    "induces a homotopy equivalence .",
    "this allows us to construct correlation functions for local observables via the local - to - global factorization product and produce an effective theory on `` zero modes . ''",
    "additionally , we get for free a trace map via bv integration , whose geometric context is explained in section [ section - fedosov - bv ] , [ section - trace ] .",
    "the explicit formula of the trace is obtained by a one - dimensional feynman graph integral , which also recovers the result of @xcite .",
    "our approach to the algebraic index theorem is then motived by equivariant localization in quantum field theory ( a game that physicists have played fruitfully for years , see for instance the work of witten @xcite ) . in physics ,",
    "one often calculates the index of an elliptic operator by computing the localization of a particular path integral in topological quantum field theory .",
    "though it lacks some mathematical rigor , this physical approach provides a conceptually clean understanding of the origins of index theorems .",
    "the basic idea is as follows , we can often write @xmath19 if the integral is independent of @xmath18 , then we can compute the index as the @xmath20 ( semi - classical ) limit of the integral and this localizes onto the low energy solutions of the system .",
    "one of our main goals in this paper is to illustrate that such localization methods can be rigorously we d with perturbative renormalization in the bv formalism and even more fundamentally , they can be incorporated into differential geometry . in our case , the quantization of one - dimensional chern - simons theory leads to a simple geometric proof of the algebraic index theorem ; this is described in section [ section - index ] .",
    "the main idea is to consider the equivariant extension of the trace map with respect to the @xmath7-rotation on the circle and show that varying @xmath18 leads to explicit equivariant exact terms ( equation ) .",
    "then the algebraic index theorem follows from the semi - classical computation where @xmath21 ( lemma [ semi - classical limit ] ) , i.e. , by feynman diagrams up to one - loop . when @xmath13 is the total space of a cotangent bundle , this is closely related to the one - loop computation of @xcite .",
    "our approach via bv quantization and factorization algebras illustrate certain geometric aspects of the computations in @xcite .",
    "it would be extremely interesting to extend these methods to higher dimensional qft models .",
