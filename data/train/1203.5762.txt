    "the wireless two - way relay channel ( fig . [ relay_channel ] ) in which bidirectional data transfer takes place between the nodes a and b with the help of the relay r is considered .",
    "all the three nodes are assumed to have half - duplex constraint , i.e. , they can not transmit and receive simultaneously in the same frequency band .",
    "the denoise and forward protocol , introduced in @xcite , is considered which consists of the following two phases : the _ multiple access _ ( ma ) phase , during which a and b simultaneously transmit to r and the _ broadcast _ ( bc ) phase during which r transmits to a and b. network coding map , also called the denoising map , is employed at r in such a way that a ( b ) can decode the message of b ( a ) , given that a ( b ) knows its own message .",
    "the concept of physical layer network coding has attracted a lot of attention in recent times .",
    "the idea of physical layer network coding for the two way relay channel was first introduced in @xcite , where the multiple access interference occurring at the relay was exploited so that the communication between the end nodes can be done using a two phase protocol .",
    "information theoretic studies for the physical layer network coding scenario were reported in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "a differential modulation scheme with analog network coding for bi - directional relaying was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the design principles governing the choice of modulation schemes to be used at the nodes for uncoded transmission were studied in @xcite .",
    "an extension for the case when the nodes use convolutional codes was done in @xcite .",

    "algorithm was proposed in @xcite to obtain such adaptive network coding maps resulting in the best distance profile at r. an alternative procedure to obtain the adaptive network coding maps , based on the removal of deep channel fade conditions called singular fade states using latin squares was proposed in @xcite .",
