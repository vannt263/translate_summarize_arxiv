    "crotons are pregeometric objects that emerge both as labels encoded on the boundary of a `` volume '' and as complementary aspects of geometric fluctuations within that volume . to express their multifacetedness , the name _ croton _ was chosen , after crotos , son of pan and eupheme , who , once a mortal @xmath0 being , was put in sky by muses as the celestial fixture sagittarius .",
    "the term volume is normally linked to the categories space or space - time . in a pre - geometric setting ,",
    "more basic categories are needed @xmath1 mersenne fluctuations and qphyla .",
    "both require various stages of _ pregeometric refinement _ which , expressed through the complementary aspects croton amplitude and phase , combine to eventually form  or dissolve  real geometric objects .",
    "advancing from mark @xmath2 to @xmath3 thus , in what follows , means a time - like refinement @xmath4 ( roughly the analog of an exponential increase of temporal resolution in tenacious time ) , and an increase from @xmath5 to mark @xmath6 a space - like refinement @xmath7 @xmath8 ( analoguous to increase of spatial resolution in sustained space ) . on the boundary , these increases find expression in additionally encoded labels .    in a previous work @xcite",
    ", basic croton components have been identfied , though at the time the name croton was not yet used .",
    "the starting point was the equivalence between a mersennian identity , destilled from the special case that two parafermi algebras @xcite are of neighboring orders @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( order marked by parenthesized superscript ) :    @xmath11    and the identities,@xmath12 , @xmath13 : + @xmath14,@xmath15 , @xmath16    @xmath17    @xmath18    leaving the details to [ sec : crotons - as - boundary ] , the way croton base numbers are derived and how they are subdivided into bases pop out naturally when the matrix elements of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are constructed .",
    "crotons , conceived of as linear combinations , use the following croton base numbers as scalars ( underlining explained later ) : for @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ; for @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ; for @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 to name only the first few ( singletons and bases ) .",
    "they are instructive enough to show how label encoding works on the boundary .",
    "we first concentrate on order @xmath30 , dropping the parenthesized superscript and just asking the reader to bear in mind that the crotons examined belong to @xmath31 .",
    "our boundary is then defined by the @xmath32 outer nodes of a @xmath33-cube complex , @xmath33 being the number of croton base numbers to handle : @xmath34 for @xmath35 , and @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "let the @xmath38-th node out of the @xmath39 of the first boundary bear the label @xmath40 , and , correspondingly , the @xmath41-th node out of the @xmath42 of the second boundary the label @xmath43(summation convention , and @xmath44 denoting all non - null @xmath33-tuples out of @xmath45 possible from @xmath46 ) .",
    "it s easy to see that the total of labels form a croton field in either case : @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the fact aside that nodes can be grouped into pairs bearing values of opposite sign , field values may occur multiply , for instance @xmath49 . with each field",
    "defined on its own boundary , it s far from obvious they should have anything in common . yet , as we assume either one deals with a distinct crotonic aspect , we have to find a way of considering them side by side .",
    "we may , for instance , ask how many distinct labels there can be expressed _ potentially _ , neglecting mere sign reversals . counting from 1 on and taking as the highest conceivable value the sum of croton base numbers in absolute terms , we arrive at the number @xmath50 of potential labels from @xmath51 . out of these , 170 are realized as node labels @xmath52 . those not realizable are 20 in number : @xmath53 .",
    "the converse holds true for the @xmath54 case .",
    "of 212 potentially attainable labels , 40 are realized by @xmath55 ( sign - reversals included , that s the stock of nodes ) , leaving 172 labels in potential status : @xmath56 .",
    "a comparable situation arises when we bunch together croton base numbers that are rooted in neighboring mersenne orders , a process we have previously termed _",
    "interordinal _ to express this kind of hybridization .",
    "we now have @xmath57 for @xmath58 @xmath59 , and @xmath34 for @xmath60 @xmath61 .",
    "neglecting sign reversals and counting again from 1 on , we get 191 potential labels from the enlarged @xmath51 and 216 from the enlarged @xmath54 .",
    "all of the 191s bunch are realized as @xmath52 on the expanded boundary s nodes ; but a singularity also springs up , @xmath62 . by contrast ,",
    "202 out of the 216s bunch are realized as @xmath55 , on another expanded boundary s nodes and with no singularity popping up , leaving 14 in potential status : @xmath63 .",
    "the conclusion is that the fields are dual to each other with respect to realizability of labels on the boundary , the reason being that they encode complementary aspects of crotonicity @xmath1 croton amplitude and phase in the volume .",
    "the duality is controlled by two quantities , catalan number @xmath64 and the number @xmath65@xmath66 :    _ intraordinal case _ : @xmath67    _ interordinal case _ :",
    "@xmath68    ( @xmath69the singularity assignment included . ) the key role in that duality is taken by the quantity @xmath70 @xmath71 around which the croton base numbers belonging to a basis of order @xmath72 are built ( hence the underlining ) :    _ _ + _ intraordinal case _ : _ _",

    "[ fig : a - prototype - qphylum ] . typically , qphyleticly related amplitudes are rooted in different time - like and space - like refinements ; nodes of a qphylum",
    "thus are associated with a set of frozen - in pregeometric `` time '' and `` space '' signatures .",
    "`` volume '' then becomes the assembly of all distinct qphyla .",
    "but let us go back one step and ask what it means when an amplitude in a given fluctuation reaches a certain level .",
    "if that level coincides with @xmath112 or @xmath113 , where @xmath113 denotes the kissing number of @xmath114-dimensional euclidean space , it could mean that a chunk of space containing an @xmath115-sphere packing _ with _ or _ without _ centerpiece was created in that fluctuation @xmath1 or dissolved if the amplitude did not peak : crotons which wax and wane .",
    "as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig : a - prototype - geometric ] shows a fluctuation that peaks at 918 , a quantity considered to be the proper kissing number of 13-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "a chunk of 13@xmath116-space containing 918 12-spheres certainly is hard to visualize , so a 2@xmath116 version may suffice to give a first impression ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1-sphere - packing - with ] ) :    1-sphere packing with our without centerpiece ]      we may ask if and how the peak amplitude 918 is related to a label @xmath52 on the boundary .",
    "certainly it is a realizable label , and one realizable _ _ intra__ordinally : all kissing numbers lying @xmath1 on the basis of @xmath117 @xmath1 in the range of potentially attainable labels can be seen to be realizable intraordinally , and this holds true too for the current basis , the 18-tuple @xmath118 ; its origin and the origin of the tuple @xmath119 @xmath120 @xmath121 are elucidated in [ sec : crotons - as - boundary ] ; [ sec : crotons - in - the ] tabularizes various kissing - number related croton amplitudes , among them also amplitude 918 ] @xmath122 @xmath123 , @xmath124 where 918 belongs : @xmath125 .",
    "the crucial question is , do we require _ all _ croton amplitudes from a given mersenne fluctuation with one of them `` geometrizing '' to have counterparts in intraordinally realizable labels on the boundary , in a narrow interpretation of the holographic principle ?",
    "amplitudes `` on the way / from there '' may at least in principle be amenable to an answer . and",
    ", what does this mean for mersenne fluctuations `` making detours '' which presumably are by far in the majority ? if one of the croton amplitudes , call it _ pivotal _ , comes only close and does not `` geometrize '' , it is because some residual mersenne fluctuations co - evolve in _ different _ qphyla . yet , with sufficiently tight space - like and time - like refinement constraints , fluctuations that are inter - qphyleticly linked to the pivotal fluctuation can be identified and examined .",
    "see the example below where one of the residual partial amplitudes is @xmath126 as @xmath127 , and the pivotal amplitude @xmath128 , together with a second residual partial amplitude @xmath129 , is closing in on @xmath130 as @xmath131 :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in both sects . [ sub : croton - field - duality ] and [ sec : application - to - subatomic ] , the part of duality control was taken by catalan numbers in conjunction with the numbers @xmath132 . understood as an expansion factor , the @xmath133 is the result of rescaling @xmath134 by a constant factor @xmath135 ; cf .",

    "resuming the discussion of labels on the boundary , we recall that out of , in the interordinal case , 192 distinct crotons ensuing from the ( enlarged ) basis @xmath144 including a null - singularity and neglecting sign reversals , _ all _ are realized on the enlarged boundary @xmath145 , an effect one would expect to carry over to the next level of hybridization , @xmath146 and @xmath147 , thus providing a useful testbed for the specifiability of characteristic physical quantities .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the catalan number @xmath148 is central to croton base numbers keeping time with the successors @xmath149 @xmath150 @xmath1 a fundamental connection which allows to define a span parameter @xmath151 quark constituents are often deemed too artifical to be true elements of nature , but , as we have seen in sect .",
    "[ sec : application - to - subatomic ] , if we concentrate on their role as carriers of fractional electric charge , @xmath152 provides a natural frame for them .",
    "it therefore comes as no surprise that ( [ eq : span ] ) supplies up - type _ and _ down - type interordinal bounds for the electromagnetic coupling constant , the dimensionless quantity @xmath5 .",
    "when normalized with the factor @xmath153 , the down - type parameter @xmath154 provides a tight upper bound @xmath155 to the current measured value @xmath156 . and",
    "the up - type parameter @xmath157 in combination with the plus - sign normalizing factor @xmath158 yields an even better lower bound : @xmath159 @xmath1 one that encompasses the residual force known as weak force , with coupling strength @xmath160 the location where @xmath161 interpolates the interval @xmath162 $ ] can to good approximation be given by the respective down - type and up - type expressions + down - type form of @xmath161 : @xmath163        obviously , the same controls that regulate the boundary conditions in croton amplitudes and phases @xmath1 raising the question : given a boundary , how many @xmath113 s are there for crotons to target at ? @xmath1 are also responsible for intergenerational mass - related selection rules on quark - and - meson @xmath170 s and @xmath171 s , raising the related question : how many euclidean dimensions out there get involved in particle creation ?",
    "key to the approach taken here answering that question is the quotient formed by @xmath172 and @xmath173 where @xmath174 is least among @xmath175 and @xmath176 is a natural number : @xmath177 it s instructive to tabularize the instantiations of eq .",

    "this suggests that the @xmath204 and the @xmath205 can be combined into a basis , @xmath206 .",
    "linear combinations of its elements with positive result may then be said to span a variety of ` source dimensions : ' out of 66 potentially realizable ones , 11 remain unrepresented on @xmath207 @xmath1 the name connoting a set of labels on the outer nodes of a @xmath33-cube complex @xmath208 constructed the way @xmath47 and @xmath48 were @xmath209 namely @xmath210 , and , neglecting sign reversals , two linear combinations yield null - singularities on @xmath207 .",
    "the @xmath176 ensuing from the two table parts can in a similar manner be combined into a basis , @xmath211 , spanning ` sink dimensions . ' out of 100 potentially realizable ones , 41 remain unrepresented on @xmath212 : @xmath213 , and , neglecting sign reversals , one linear combination yields a null - singularity on @xmath212 .",
    "the two boundaries can in turn be combined , to the effect that the number of unrepresentable dimensions shrinks to 22 .",
    "the overall picture emerging from these numbers is as follows : the particle - creation potential of the first 100 euclidean dimensions is governed by the characteristic number 11 .",
    "all other characteristics arising _ en route _ are identical to or multiples of this number @xmath1 the @xmath199-invariant 33 , the unrepresentable 11 ` source dimensions ' out of 66 potentially realizable ones , the number of unrepresentable ` sink dimensions ' plus the number of null - singularities under the union @xmath214 , @xmath215 , as well as the number of dimensions staying uninvolved in particle creation even when the distinction between source and sink dimensions is dropped , the said 22 unrepresentable dimensions @xmath216 . on the other hand , the number of ` sink dimensions ' resisting representation on the single @xmath212 , 41 , to which we may add 1 to account for the one singularity remaining , coincides with @xmath217 s interpolating term @xmath218 that makes the span parameters @xmath219 bound the electromagnetic coupling constant so tightly in the first place .",
    "so it s worthwhile to go into the details of the dimensional branching process .    at the heart of it",
    "resides a unique link leading from @xmath220 as starting point to @xmath221 as end point @xmath222 .",
    "in fact , @xmath223 in typical interordinal manner , gets down to the last member of the catalan - number sequence @xmath224 via @xmath225 and @xmath226 , in turn , completes the descent intraordinally to the end point      how the numbers @xmath228 and @xmath229 work is sort of like in a double strand , @xmath230 : horizontally , they serve as upper and lower ties , vertically , as left and right strands . the number of ` source dimensions ' evolves to @xmath231 ( left strand ) of which @xmath232 can be represented on @xmath207 . panning to the ` sink side ' ( right strand ) , branching does nt end up until at @xmath233 ` sink dimensions ' of which , after all , 12@xmath234 can be represented on @xmath212 . the complete @xmath235 s sequence of catalan controls @xmath224 is exhausted in the process .",
    "the goings - on of course have to be implemented crotonically .",
    "take , for example , the creation of the eighteenth dimension : the only certified croton amplitude in the ` volume ' to match @xmath236 and be representated on the global boundaries @xmath47,@xmath48 occurs in a mersenne fluctuation of type i ( see table [ tab : specific - fractions - in ] ) , at time - like refinement @xmath237 and secondary expansion @xmath238 .",
    "we note @xmath239 .",
    "remarkably , with the the same choice of fluctuation , crotons creating the remaining basic ` source ' and ` sink dimensions ' , as far as @xmath240 to match their kissing numbers are available , are found to share the global property pairing @xmath241 , @xmath242 which may be interpreted as dual to the left - strand effect discussed above :        for a full - scale description of the implementation another type of crotons in the ` volume ' suit better : where @xmath166 , ( cfr ) @xmath255 $ ] . as we shall see , a croton @xmath256 qualifying as a pivot for @xmath113 has the special property that the gap between it and the target can be bridged by integer addition within a collection of local co - amplitudes @xmath257 @xmath1 a procedure that is mirrored on a refinement - dependent , _ local _ boundary @xmath258 .",
    "for the envisioned relationship we establish the following rules : + ( 1 ) when @xmath259 , @xmath256 qualifies as a pivot with target @xmath113 if @xmath260 does not exceed a prespecified range , say ,",
