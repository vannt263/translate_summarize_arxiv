    "the stress tensors in general are widely used for description of internal forces of matter in various fields of science such as mechanical engineering and material science . in quantum systems",
    "as well , the stress tensors have been investigated for many years , including one of the earliest quantum mechanics papers @xcite . as for the stress tensors in quantum mechanics context",
    ", we can find several different definitions and applications in the literature .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite and followers focus on the stress tensor which is associated with forces on nuclei . in contrast",
    ", the one we consider in this paper is the electronic stress tensor , which is associated with effects caused by internal forces acting on electrons in molecules , following ref .",
    "this electronic stress tensor has been used to investigate chemical bonds and reactions and many interesting properties have been discovered @xcite .",
    "we briefly review our past works on the electronic stress tensor which are closely related to this paper . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been proposed that a covalent bond can be described by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the electronic stress tensor . in detail , the bonding region with covalency can be characterized and visualized by the  spindle structure \" , where the largest eigenvalue of the electronic stress tensor is positive and the corresponding eigenvectors form a bundle of flow lines that connects nuclei . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the eigenvalues of the electronic stress tensor of various homonuclear diatomic molecules have been investigated and all metals and metalloids molecules studied there exhibit the negative largest eigenvalue at the midpoint of the nuclei . ref .",
    "@xcite has mentioned that this negativity of the largest eigenvalue may be connected to the metallic nature of bonding but , at the same time , it has been known that the negative largest eigenvalue appears between a pair of atomic nuclei with very short distance such as the c - c bond in c@xmath2h@xmath2 @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the al@xmath3 and pd clusters have been investigated and we have shown  pseudo - spindle structure \" @xcite between metal nuclei . the pseudo - spindle structure is a negative eigenvalue version of the spindle structure and , more precisely , it is the region between two atoms where the largest eigenvalue of the electronic stress tensor is negative and corresponding eigenvectors forming a pattern which connects them .",
    "however , again , the pseudo - spindle structure is also seen in c@xmath2h@xmath2 @xcite . since the pseudo - spindle structure is seen in many bonds between metal nuclei , it is tempting to associate it with a metallic bond , but it seems that the pseudo - spindle structure is not sufficient to capture the entire feature of a metallic bond .    in this paper , we would like to argue how we may describe a metallic bond using the electronic stress tensor .",
    "the conventional wisdom would say that it is not sensible to define  a metallic bond \" because metal is something defined only for bulk with many electrons and ions .",
    "our challenge is capturing some aspects of a metallic bond or metallicity of a chemical bond using the electronic stress tensor . as a starting point , we tackle this problem using small clusters of lithium , the simplest metal .",
    "there are many studies on the nature of bonding in the li clusters in the literature using such methods as by generalized valence - bond @xcite , electron localization function ( elf ) @xcite and quantum theory of atoms in molecules ( qtaim ) @xcite .",
    "we would also like to see whether our stress tensor approach gives complementary views to these methods .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to our conclusion .",
    "in this section , we summarize quantities and method we use for our electronic stress tensor analysis .",
    "our stress tensor is based on the rigged quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) theory @xcite .",
    "the rigged qed is the ordinary qed ( the theory of photons and electrons ) equipped with degrees of freedom of atomic nuclei in order to be used for atomic or molecular systems .",
    "since this is a theory of quantum fields , there exist quantum operators defined at each point in spacetime . by using the equation of motion for operators of various physical quantities , many interesting operator relations have been found @xcite .",
    "the one related to the electronic stress tensor is the equation of motion of the kinetic momentum density operator .",
    "it turns out that the time derivative of the kinetic momentum density operator can be expressed by the sum of the two force operators : the tension density operator @xmath4 and the lorentz force density operator @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath4 can be expressed by the divergence of some 3 by 3 tensor operator , which we call the stress tensor density operator @xmath6 .",
    "we obtain the quantum field theory version of the equilibrium equation of stress tensor by taking the expectation value of this equation of motion with respect to stationary electronic state of an atom or molecule ( note that the expectation value of the time derivative of any operator with respect to stationary state is zero ) as @xmath7 or @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 denotes the expectation value , @xmath11 and @xmath12    the expectation values for the stress tensor density and tension density can be expressed as @xmath13 , \\label{eq : stress } \\\\",

    "note that our definition of the kinetic energy density is not positive - definite . using this kinetic energy density",
    ", we can divide the whole space into three types of region : the electronic drop region @xmath26 with @xmath27 , where classically allowed motion of electron is guaranteed and the electron density is amply accumulated ; the electronic atmosphere region @xmath28 with @xmath29 , where the motion of electron is classically forbidden and the electron density is dried up ; and the electronic interface @xmath30 with @xmath31 , the boundary between @xmath26 and @xmath28 , which corresponds to a turning point .",
    "the @xmath30 can give a clear image of the intrinsic shape of atoms and molecules and is therefore an important region in particular .",
    "the electronic structures used in this paper are obtained by the gaussian 09 @xcite for cluster models and abinit @xcite for periodic models .",

    ".  - , introduced in this section .",
    "some part of the visualization is done using pymol molecular viewer program @xcite .",
    "in this section , we analyze the smallest li cluster , li@xmath2 , by the electronic stress tensor . for comparison , we also show the results of stress tensor analysis of h@xmath2 and lih .",
    "the computation is performed by the coupled - cluster single - double ( ccsd ) method using the 6 - 311++g * * basis set @xcite .",
    "before we discuss li@xmath2 , we review how the chemical bond of the hydrogen molecule is expressed by the electronic stress tensor ( eq .  ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_h2 ]  ( b ) , we plot the largest eigenvalue of the stress tensor and corresponding eigenvector on the plane including the internuclear axis . if the largest eigenvalue of the stress tensor is positive , it is called the tensile stress , and if negative , it is called the compressive stress . namely , the sign of the largest eigenvalue tells whether electrons at a certain point in space exhibit tensile stress or compressive stress .",
    "the difference between tensile stress and compressive stress are described as follows .",
    "if we consider a fictitious plane at some point in atomic or molecular system , there are two ways that a part on one side of the plane acts on the other part of the plane .",
    "one is when electrons on one side of the plane is  pulled up \" by the electron field on the other side .",
    "the other is when electrons on one side is  pushed back \" by the electron field on the other side .",
    "the former corresponds to the tensile stress and the latter to the compressive stress .",
    "the direction of the eigenvector corresponds to the direction normal to the plane . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_h2 ]  ( b ) , we can see that the region with positive eigenvalue spreads between the h atoms and , in that region , the eigenvectors form a bundle of flow lines that connects the h nuclei .",
    "such a region is called  spindle structure \" @xcite and it is clearly seen in the figure .",
    "this means that electrons close to one h nucleus are pulled up by the electron field close to another h nucleus .",
    "such a structure can be associated with the formation of the tight bonding and has a suitable directionality for a bond between two h nuclei .",
    "thus , it is proposed that such positive eigenvalue region is the manifestation of the strong covalent bond @xcite .",
    "we now turn to li@xmath2 , whose largest eigenvalue of the stress tensor and corresponding eigenvector is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_li2 ]  ( b ) in the same manner as h@xmath2 .",
    "the striking difference is that there is a region with the negative largest eigenvalue between li nuclei and there is no spindle structure .",
    "we do not even see a ",
    "pseudo - spindle structure \" @xcite , the negative eigenvalue version of the spindle structure ( _ i.e. _ the region with the eigenvectors forming a bundle of flow lines that connects two nuclei but with negative eigenvalues ) , which is frequently seen between metallic atoms @xcite .",
    "this means that the electron field pushes back electrons in the neighboring regions with no solid directionality which can be considered as a bond axis .",
    "this is similar to the stress tensor of liquid .",
    "a liquid has the ability to flow .",
    "liquid particles are loosely bound and they can move around one another freely . such properties can be well associated with electrons in metal .",
    "in fact , coincidentally , metallic bonding is often described as an  electron sea \" and the positively charged metal ions . it may be unusual to say li@xmath2 has purely a metallic bond with no trace of covalency but if we look at the electronic stress tensor , it is totally different from a covalent bond and certainly has a feature which can be called metallic .",
    "we will return to this point when we discuss larger li clusters .    after seeing the difference between h@xmath2 and li@xmath2 in terms of the electronic stress tensor",
    ", it may be interesting to see what the stress tensor of lih look like .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_lih ]  ( b ) .",
    "it has both positive and negative regions between h and li nuclei .",
    "the region close to h / li has positive / negative eigenvalue . in the region very close to the internuclear axis , there is some flow of eigenvectors in the direction of connecting the nuclei , but it is somewhat different from spindle or pseudo - spindle structures .",
    "therefore , we can say that lih has a bond with solid directionality like covalent bond of h@xmath2 but there is a strong part nearby h and a weaker part nearby li .",
    "it is tempting to associate this with an ionic bond , but we reserve conclusion until more examples are examined .    since we have discussed the analogy between the stress tensors of li@xmath2 and liquid , it is important to investigate the other two eigenvalues .",
    "we plot all the three eigenvalues of the stress tensor for h@xmath2 , li@xmath2 and lih along the internuclear axes in fig .",
    "[ fig : eig_li2h2lih ] . the bond length and the eigenvalues at the lagrange point",
    "are summarized in table [ tab : li2h2lih ] .",
    "let us first look at h@xmath2 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eig_li2h2lih ] ( a ) , around the midpoint of the two h nuclei , the largest eigenvalue ( @xmath32 ) is positive and the smaller eigenvalues ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) are negative and degenerate .",
    "the absolute values of the three eigenvalues are @xmath35 and so are the differences between @xmath32 and @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "[ fig : eig_li2h2lih ] ( b ) shows the case of li@xmath2 and we see that the three eigenvalues are all negative around the midpoint of the two li nuclei .",
    "two larger eigenvalues ( @xmath32 and @xmath34 ) are degenerate and the smallest one ( @xmath33 ) is smaller than them by only @xmath36 . therefore , compared to the case of h@xmath2 , the three eigenvalues of li@xmath2 can be regarded as degenerate .",
    "such degeneracy in the eigenvalues of stress tensor , suggesting the lack of directionality , solidifies the analogy with liquid .",
    "note that , in terms of the stress tensor , liquid is defined by the three eigenvalues which are negative and degenerate .",
    "this is in stark contrast with the case of h@xmath2 , whose eigenvalue pattern indicates the strong directionality of the bond .",
    "the case of lih is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eig_li2h2lih ] ( c ) .",
    "the three eigenvalues are almost degenerate in the region close to li and the region close to h has positive largest eigenvalue and two smaller eigenvalues are negative and degenerate .",
    "it is different from both li@xmath2 and h@xmath2 and it looks like a mixture of li@xmath2 and h@xmath2 . such a feature could be a hint to consider how an ionic bond may be expressed by the electronic stress tensor , but , again , we need more examples .",
    "so far , we have analyzed the molecules at the equilibrium distances and discussed their nature of bonding .",
    "we now try to extract more information by changing the internuclear distances .",
    "in particular , if we compute the stress tensors at very long distances , we can study the nature of bonding from the viewpoint of the bond formation .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the stress tensor for h@xmath2 , li@xmath2 and lih at various internuclear distances are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : dist_h2 ] , [ fig : dist_li2 ] and [ fig : dist_lih ] . in the following discussion , the zero surface of the kinetic energy density ( sec .",
    "[ sec : calc ] , eq .  ) , the electronic interface @xmath30 , plays an important role . as is explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : calc ] , @xmath30 is the boundary between the electronic drop region @xmath26 ( where the electron density is accumulated ) and the electronic atmosphere region @xmath28 ( where the electron density is dried up ) . in the figures",

    "it is useful to remember @xmath26 s exist , naturally , around nuclei .",
    "when we look at the figures with very long internuclear distances , we see @xmath30 exists around each nucleus , indicating that they do not form molecules and suggesting the existence of independent atoms .",
    "moving to the figures with shorter internuclear distances , we see that @xmath30 s around nucleus get closer , merge and eventually form @xmath30 for the molecules at the equilibrium distances . incidentally",
    ", the state when @xmath30 s just begin to merge , namely touch each other , is called the ",
    "intrinsic electronic transition state \" @xcite .",
    "we denote the internuclear distance at this state by @xmath37 .",
    "the notable fact is that , when the distance is so long that @xmath30 s are well separated ( when practically considered as an infinite distance ) , we see the spindle structure at @xmath28 between the two nuclei for all of h@xmath2 , li@xmath2 and lih ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : dist_h2 ] ( d ) , [ fig : dist_li2 ] ( h ) and [ fig : dist_lih ] ( d ) respectively ) .",
    "this means that electrons in @xmath26 nearby nuclei are pulled up toward @xmath28 through @xmath30 , resulting in the formation of a lewis electron pair .",
    "in other words , all the molecules are covalently bonded at the very long distances . in the case of h@xmath2 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_h2 ] , the spindle structure continues to exist at shorter distances including @xmath38 and the equilibrium distance .    in the case of li@xmath2",

    "first , we observe that the spindle structure exist at the intrinsic electronic transition state ( @xmath39 , fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_li2 ] ( g ) ) .",
    "then , at 3.31@xmath40 , the positive eigenvalue region vanishes and the spindle structure turns into the pseudo - spindle structure .",
    "( note that , at slightly longer distance of 3.36@xmath40 , the positive eigenvalue region vanishes on the internuclear axis while positive areas remain away from the axis .",
    "namely , between 3.36@xmath40 and 3.31@xmath40 , the positive region is not simply connected . )",
    "that pseudo - spindle structure is broken at 2.78@xmath40 , at which three eigenvalues are degenerate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_li2eig ] ( b ) ) . at shorter distances ,",
    "we see a negative region with no particular directionality such as to connect two nuclei , especially at the equilibrium distance .",
    "this is an example of what has been argued in ref .",
    "@xcite . when there are two distant li atoms , the tensile stress ( as is indicated by the spindle structure ) pulls up electron in @xmath26 to the adjacent @xmath28 through @xmath30 which separates them .",
    "the consequence is the formation of the long - range lewis pair of electron .",
    "as the distant pair of li atoms comes closer , the spindle structure disappears , indicating that the lewis pair is unbound .",
    "this is considered to be a manifestation of metallicity .    in the case of lih , at long distances , @xmath28 between li and h",
    "is characterized by the spindle structure as mentioned above and , in particular at @xmath41 . in fig.[fig : dist_lih ] ( c ) , we see the contact point of the two interfaces is covered by the spindle structure . when the distance gets shorter , although the spindle structure is partly lost , the positive eigenvalue region remains around h. the negative eigenvalue region develops in the region close to li but",
    "do not cover the whole space unlike the case of li@xmath2 .",
    "as for lih , from the viewpoint of the electronic stress tensor , we may conclude that it has a bond which is neither covalent nor metallic .",
    "whether we can categorize it as ionic or other bonding is an interesting question to ask and will be investigated in future .",

    "let us summarize our results using the differential eigenvalues .",
    "the li clusters are characterized by @xmath69 and @xmath70 whereas the hydrocarbon molecules @xmath71 and @xmath70 . in particular , @xmath72 .",
    "this means that the electronic stress tensor between atom pairs in the hydrocarbon molecules shows directionality while it does not show much directionality in the case of the li clusters .    in summary of this section ,",
    "first of all , we find that most of the hydrocarbon molecules are different from the li clusters in a sense that the largest eigenvalue of the stress tensor is positive .",
    "although some of the triple c - c bonds have the largest eigenvalue which is negative , they do not look like those of the li clusters due to the non - degeneracy of the eigenvalues . there is no hydrocarbon molecule which has the electronic stress tensor like that of liquid , at least in our hydrocarbon molecule set .",
    "thus , this results are not inconsistent with the idea proposed in the last section that negativity and degeneracy of the eigenvalues of the electronic stress tensor may characterize and quantify some aspects of the metallicity of chemical bonding .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the electronic structure of small lithium clusters li@xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) using the electronic stress tensor .",
    "we have found that the degeneracy pattern of the three eigenvalues @xmath18 @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) of the electronic stress tensor at the lagrange points of the li clusters is very much different from that of the hydrocarbon molecules , which are covalently bonded .",
    "namely , the three eigenvalues of the li clusters have almost same values while the hydrocarbon molecules have the largest eigenvalue much larger than the second largest eigenvalue , which has similar value to the smallest eigenvalue .",
    "the former degeneracy pattern indicates that the bonds are not directional while the latter indicates the clear directionality of the bonds .",
    "the negativity of the largest eigenvalue is not unique feature of the li clusters ( some of the c - c triple bonds exhibit the negative largest eigenvalue ) but this degeneracy is characteristic to li .",
    "we can consider that such difference in the degeneracy pattern reflects the metallic nature of bonding of the li clusters and the covalent nature of bonding of the hydrocarbon molecules .",
    "note that the negativity and degeneracy of the stress tensor , which is the property of the liquid , is readily associated with the tradition that the metal can be viewed as  electron sea \" .    to describe the degeneracy pattern of the eigenvalues in a compact manner ,",
    "we have proposed to use the differential eigenvalues : @xmath73 and @xmath74 . by using them ,",
    "the degeneracy patterns of the eigenvalues can be summarized as @xmath75 .",
    "it is of great interest whether this relation can be extended as @xmath76 in general . in this paper , we have only examined the li clusters with limited numbers of atoms .",
    "it is important to check this relation with larger li clusters and also with other metal clusters .",
    "then , the role of the electronic stress tensor in describing the metallicity would be elucidated and more detailed classification among the  metallic bond \" would be possible .",
