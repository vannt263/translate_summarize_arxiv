    "<S> the nature of the topology changing transition is in general unknown and remains an intriguing open problem with the possibility of new universality classes . for a liquid of fibonacci anyons </S>",
    "<S> there has been a recent discussion of quantum critical behavior by fendley from the perspective of ground - state wavefunctions and their respective correlators in terms of conformal field theory @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> -1 mm    finally , in order to explore the broader context of our models we complete our analysis by considering the complete set of possible excitations present in these models . </S>",
    "<S> an excitation different from the ones already discussed arises when relaxing the constraint which for every trivalent vertex of the skeleton lattice forbids the occurrence of a single @xmath1-flux . </S>",
    "<S> if we allow for this possibility , we are left with a @xmath1-flux entering the vertex through one tube , but not leaving it through another tube in the skeleton plane as illustrated in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> instead we can think of the remaining @xmath1-flux at such a vertex as leaving through one of the liquid sheets surrounding the skeleton lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this piercing of the liquid by a @xmath1-flux corresponds to a vortex excitation of the liquid and is illustrated as a ` chimney ' in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : chiralexcitations ] . </S>",
    "<S> these vortex excitations break time - reversal symmetry and turn out to all possess the same chirality ( indicated by the red arrow in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : chiralexcitations ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is only possible if the anyonic liquid on a given sheet itself possess a given chirality . </S>",
    "<S> since the entire system exhibits time - reversal symmetry , this means that the two anyonic liquids on the two sheets must have opposite chirality . </S>",
    "<S> vortices associated with chimneys on opposite sheets thus also have opposite chirality as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : chiralexcitations ] . </S>",
    "<S> ( in fact , a vortex in one sheet can be related to a vortex in the opposite sheet by dragging a vortex through a ` hole ' connecting the two sheets . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we can create a ` hole ' connecting the sheets by glueing together two vortex excitations on opposite sheets . ) </S>",
    "<S> this conceptual perspective of two anyonic liquids with opposite chirality giving rise to a time - reversal invariant model connects with and allows a visualization of a more abstract mathematical description of these models , namely doubled non - abelian chern - simons theories @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it remains an intriguing question to formulate our topology driven phase transitions within such a field theoretical framework .    </S>",
    "<S> in this manuscript we have developed a general , unifying framework to formulate topological aspects of quantum states of matter for systems preserving time - reversal symmetry and of their phase transitions . in a simple and intuitive picture </S>",
    "<S> they are described in terms of fluctuations of two - dimensional surfaces and their topology changes . </S>",
    "<S> our framework gives a new perspective on how to broadly discuss quantum phase transitions out of topologically ordered states of matter , which has so far been largely unexplored territory due to the lack of a local order parameter description amenable to a landau - ginzburg - wilson theory . </S>",
