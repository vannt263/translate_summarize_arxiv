    "the central location of agn in their host galaxies and the fact that they can produce a large amount of energy imply that agn can play a very important role in setting the physical conditions in their vicinity as well as on larger , galactic and even intergalactic scales ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "there are many indications that support this idea .",
    "for example , the presence of broad and narrow emission lines , broad and narrow absorption lines , in agn spectra suggests that agn continuum radiation affects the immediate environment of agn ( see @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "in addition , the tight correlation between the mass ( @xmath12 ) of the central black hole ( bh ) in a galactic nucleus and the velocity dispersion @xmath13 of the galaxy s bulge or spheroid , the so - called `` @xmath14 '' relation ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) can be explained by the feedback between agn and the infalling material from large distances .",
    "this feedback can quench both bh accretion and star formation in the galaxy when bh reaches a certain mass .",
    "agns could provide such feedback because they are very powerful sources of energy and momentum ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    agn are powered by mass accretion onto a super massive black hole ( smbh ) . to illustrate how the growth of smbh can be self - regulated and how agn feedback can be characterized ,",
    "let us first express the radiation luminosity due to accretion as @xmath15 where we invoke the simplest assumption such that the luminosity is proportional to the mass accretion rate ( @xmath16 ) and a radiative ( or the rest - mass conversion ) efficiency ( @xmath17 ) . both @xmath17 and @xmath18 are uncertain .",
    "for example , @xmath17 ranges from @xmath9 in a standard , radiatively efficient thin disk to @xmath19 for spherically symmetric accretion from a low density medium ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) while the mass accretion rate depends on poorly constrained physical conditions and geometry at large distances from the black hole .    a common method to estimate @xmath18 is to adopt the analytic formula by @xcite who considered spherically symmetric accretion from a non - rotating polytropic gas with uniform density @xmath20 and sound speed @xmath21 at infinity .",
    "under these assumptions , a steady state solution to the equations of mass and momentum conservation exists with a mass accretion rate of @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a dimensionless parameter that , for the newtonian potential , depends only on the adiabatic index ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the bondi radius , @xmath24 , is defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the gravitational constant and @xmath27 is the mass of the accretor .",
    "one can quantify agn feedback by measuring its efficiency in affecting the flow of energy , momentum , and mass . in this work , we consider only the energy and momentum carried out by matter .",
    "the total energy feedback efficiency @xmath28 is defined as the ratio between the accretion luminosity of the system @xmath29 ( eq .  [ [ eq : l - acc ] ] ) and the sum of the kinetic power ( kinetic energy flux ) @xmath30 and thermal energy power ( thermal energy flux ) @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath32    similarly , the kinetic energy and thermal energy feedback efficiencies ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) are defined as @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively . from these definitions , it obviously follows that @xmath37 .    the momentum feedback efficiency ( @xmath38 ) is defined as the ratio of the total wind momentum @xmath39 to the total radiation momentum ( @xmath40 ) , i.e. , @xmath41",
    "lastly , the mass feedback efficiency @xmath42 is defined as the ratio of the mass - outflow rate at the outer boundary @xmath43 to the mass - inflow rate at the inner boundary @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath45    the most advanced studies of feedback effects were carried out by @xcite ( sdh05 hereafter ) , @xcite and @xcite ( bs09 hereafter ) . these studies used computer simulations of merging galaxies in which they linked local and global processes .",
    "this was possible because they adopted relatively crude phenomenological realizations of star formation , radiative cooling in a complex multi - phase medium , bh accretion and feedback , and because their spatial resolution is larger than @xmath24 .",
    "in particular , they assumed values of the above introduced efficiencies instead of directly computing them .",
    "a main result of these simulations is that the @xmath14 relation can be reproduced remarkably well and that the relation is insensitive to the gas fraction in the model galaxies .",
    "in addition , the bh mass appears to be little affected by the details of star formation and supernova feedback .",
    "@xcite argued that the results from simulations of merging galaxies suggest that the feedback regulating bh accretion operates on local scales , comparable to @xmath24 or closer in , rather than solely on the global scales usually considered ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they also presumed that the insensitivity to gas fraction occurs in the galaxy merger simulations because the gas mass is somehow `` maximized '' on the scales where the accretion rate is determined .",
    "thus on these scales , bh feedback can be much more important than that due to stars .",
    "if this is correct then for state - of - the - art models , the key feedback processes represent `` subgrid '' physics .",
    "this is a limitation of current models of agn feedback in large scale cosmological and galaxy merger simulations because they can not be directly related to agn physics .    on the other hand , simulations that aim to provide insights to agn physics",
    "do not include galaxy but rather focus on @xmath24 or even smaller scales ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus they can not be directly related to agn feedback on large scales .",
    "however , these smaller scale simulations can be used directly to measure the feedback efficiencies listed above .",
    "consequently , they can be used to quantify the effects that are assumed or parametrized in large scale simulations .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present measurements of the mass accretion rate , and various feedback efficiencies based on direct simulations of inflows and outflows in agn , on sub - parsec and parsec scales performed by @xcite ( kp09 hereafter ) . in other words",
    ", we wish to determine if agn can supply energy in the form and amount required by the cosmological and galaxy merger simulations .",
    "in recent cosmological and galaxy merger simulations ( e.g. , sdh05 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; bs09 ) , the actual physical process of the mass - accretion onto the bh is not explicitly modeled because of a relatively poor resolution .",
    "often , these simulations rely on a separate analytical model to describe the small scale physical processes .",
    "the unresolved accretion process is usually described by a bondi - hoyle - little formulation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . here",
    ", we consider the case in which the accreting bh does not move with respect to the surrounding gas .",
    "this reduces the process to a simpler bondi spherical accretion problem .",
    "then , the mass - accretion rate can be written as equation  ( [ eq : mdot_bondi ] ) .",
    "the dimensionless constant @xmath23 ( in eq .",
    "[ [ eq : mdot_bondi ] ] ) depends on the adiabatic index @xmath46 . for the gas with @xmath47 @xmath48 ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the bondi accretion formula relates the mass - accretion rate of a bh located at the center to the gas density and the sound speed ( or equivalently the temperature ) of the gas at a large scale .    on the other hand , in the bondi accretion prescription used by e.g. ,",
    "sdh05 and bs09 , the mass - accretion rate is written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the density and the sound speed estimated near the bh using the surrounding smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph : @xcite ; @xcite ) gas particles .",
    "note that the expression contains `` the dimensionless parameter '' @xmath52 which is different from @xmath23 in equation  ( [ eq : mdot_bondi ] ) .",
    "sdh05 introduced @xmath52 parameter to overcome the gap in the scale sizes between the numerical resolution and the bondi accretion regime . in a typical cosmological or galaxy merger sph simulation ,",
    "the smoothing length ( @xmath53  pc ) is much larger than the gravitational radius of influence or the bondi radius , @xmath54 , which is @xmath55  pc .",
    "if we assume the gas located at a large distance , heated by the agn radiation , is `` comptonized '' ( @xmath56  k ) , the corresponding speed of sound ( assuming @xmath57 ) is relatively high ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "sdh05 , bs09 and others ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) find that a very large factor of @xmath52 is required for low - mass bhs to grow their masses ; hence , the problem is not strictly a bondi accretion problem .",
    "most of the agn feedback model in the cosmological simulations mentioned above assume a constant value of @xmath59 ( see also table  2 in bs09 ) except for bs09 who allow @xmath52 to depend on the value of local gas density .",
    "the assumption of a very large value of @xmath52 becomes inadequate when the local gas density is higher than that required by the formation of the a cold interstellar gas phase , and when the cosmological simulation does resolve the jean length and the bondi radius ( bs09 ) .    by noting these",
    ", bs09 abandoned the assumption of constant @xmath52 in equation  ( [ eq : mdot_bondi_sph ] ) , and introduced the following parametrization of @xmath52 .",

    "@xcite and @xcite concluded that the models need both radiation and mechanical feedback mechanisms included at the same time to account for observations such as the ratio of the central bh mass to the stellar mass ratio ( @xmath142 ) , and the x - ray luminosity of hot diffused gas .",

    "the accretion rate of our model and that of the bondi accretion model agree with each other .",
    "an important difference between the two models is the steepness of the dependency on the density .",

    "our total and kinetic energy efficiencies are about @xmath135 times smaller than their values .",
    "these large discrepancies would suggest a few things .",
    "for example , our models are missing important elements .",
    "in particular , we do not include effects of dust which could make the outflows stronger .",
    "in addition , we focus here on axisymmetric models which could differ from fully three - dimensional ( 3-d ) models .",
    "our preliminary 3-d simulations show that in 3-d , the wind kinetic energy is smaller than in 2-d while the opposite is true for the thermal energy ( @xcite ) .",
    "although these changes are small ( less than a factor of 2 ) in one of the cases studied by @xcite , they could be more significant in other cases ( i.e. , for the luminosity higher and lower than @xmath154 assumed by @xcite ) .",
    "it is also possible that the agn feedback may not be as effective as one might have had expected . instead",
    ", other forms of feedback may be more significant than the agn feedback via radiation on scales between @xmath133 and a few parsecs .",
    "they include , the supernova feedback , the radiative feedback from star formation , the strong stellar wind from massive stars , and strong accretion disk winds or jets from agn .",
    "the last two forms will introduce magnetic fields which may carry outward fluxes of energy and momentum .",
    "it is also possible that the agn feedback efficiencies are indeed low and the agns take a long time to influence their environment .",
    "we note that in our models the agns do not shut off the mass supply completely even at very high luminosities .",
    "this indicates that the agns could operate on a very long time scale over which their impact on the environment can accumulate , and eventually become significant .",
    "finally , we conclude by noting that agn feedback has two distinct modes : ( 1 )  radiation - driven ( quasar ) mode and ( 2 )  magnetic driven ( radio jet ) mode . in the current cosmological simulations , it is particularly difficult to deal with the latter , as it requires a full magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) treatment , and we do not have an adequate resolution and more importantly the full understanding of the jet mechanism .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite extended the original implementation of the quasar mode feedback in sdh05 by injecting energy at random positions within a sphere centered around a bh to emulate the hot gas bubbles created by agn jets",
    ". the radio mode could be very important in certain situations , such as the cooling flows in clusters of galaxies where channeling the energy within a very narrow jet helps to transport the energy outside a galaxy .",
    "however , this occurs in the low accretion rate regime , and it is subdominant in terms of the total bh mass growth . on the other hand , our simulations do not include the mhd treatment of the collimated jet ; hence , the focus of this paper is on the physical mechanism of the quasar mode feedback . since the quasar mode is the dominant process for the total bh mass growth , our results of low feedback efficiencies would have significant implications on the mass growth of smbhs in the early universe . in the near future ,",
    "we plan to further investigate the implications of our results by taking the boundary conditions of our simulations from full cosmological hydrodynamic simulations , and thereby making more direct connections with the physical conditions in a cosmological context .",
