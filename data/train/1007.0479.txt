    "in recent years there has been considerable interest in the cosmological models with variable gravitational constant @xmath7 and the cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "variation of the gravitational constant was first suggested by dirac @xcite in an attempt to understand the appearance of certain very large numbers , when atomic and cosmic worlds are compared .",
    "he postulates that the gravitational constant @xmath7 decreases inversely with cosmic time .",
    "canuto et al . @xcite made numerous suggestions based on different arguments that @xmath7 is indeed time dependent .",
    "beesham @xcite has studied the creation with variable @xmath7 and pointed out the variation of the form @xmath8 , originally proposed by dirac @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "einstein introduced the cosmological constant @xmath0 to account for a stable static universe as appeared to him at the time . when he later knew of the universal expansion he regretted its inclusion in his field equations .",
    "now cosmologist believe that is not identically , but very close to zero .",
    "they relate this constant to the vacuum energy that first inflated a universe causing it to expand @xcite . from the point of view of particle physics",
    "a vacuum energy could correspond to quantum field that is diluted to its present small value .",
    "however , other cosmologists dictate a time variation of this constant in order to account for its present smallness @xcite .",
    "the variation of its constant could resolve some of the standard model problems like @xmath7 , the constant @xmath0 is a gravity coupling and both should therefore be treated on an equal footing .",
    "the generalized einstein s theory of gravitation with time dependent @xmath7 and @xmath0 has been proposed by lau @xcite .",
    "the possibility of variable @xmath7 and @xmath0 in einstein theory has also been studied by dersarkissian @xcite .",
    "this relation plays an important role in cosmology .",
    "berman @xcite and sistero @xcite have considered the einstein field equations with perfect fluid and variable @xmath7 and for robertson - walker line element .",
    "kalligas et al .",
    "@xcite have studied frw models with variable @xmath0 and @xmath7 and discussed the possible connection with power - law time dependence of @xmath7 .",
    "abdussattar and vishwakarama @xcite presented r - w models with variable @xmath0 and @xmath7 by admitting a contracted ricci collineation along the fluid flow vector . recently some of us and others have studied cosmological models with variable @xmath7 and @xmath0 in a diversified fields @xcite .",
    "thus the implication of time varying @xmath0 and @xmath7 are important to study the early evolution of the universe .    in the present paper a five dimensional kaluza - klein cosmological model",
    "is considered with variable @xmath7 and @xmath0 which provides an expanding universe .",
    "it is found that the gravitational constant decreases with time as @xmath9 whereas the cosmological constant decreases as @xmath2 , @xmath10 and @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the equation of state parameter , @xmath6 is the scale factor .",
    "however , we have come across with some awkward situations in connection to the deceleration parameter and the age of the universe as far as the scenario of present accelerating universe is concerned . in the present investigation ,",
    "our approach is similar to that of collins et al . @xcite for solving the einstein field equations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sections 2 and 3 we present the basic field equations governing the models and their solutions . a critical discussion and conclusion are provided in section 4 .",
    "we consider five dimensional kaluze - klein space - time given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are function of the temporal coordinate @xmath14 only .",
    "the universe is assumed to be filled with distribution of matter represented by energy - momentum tensor for a perfect fluid @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the energy density of the cosmic matter and @xmath17 is its pressure , @xmath18 is the unit flow vector such that @xmath19 .",
    "we assume that the matter content obeys an equation of state @xmath20    the field equations are those of einstein but with time dependent cosmological and gravitational constants and are given by weinberg @xcite @xmath21 the spatial average scale factor @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 and average volume scale factor @xmath24 .",
    "the average hubble parameter h may be generalized in anisotropic cosmological model as @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 and an over head dot denotes ordinary differentiation with respect to cosmic time @xmath14 .",
    "we also have @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are hubble s factor in the directions of @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively .    for the line element ( 1 ) the einstein field equations ( 4 ) yield the following equations @xmath35",
    "@xmath36 @xmath37 if we use the equivalent energy conservation of general relativity by taking the covariant derivative of einstein field equations ( 4 ) we find that @xmath38 this provides @xcite @xmath39 as well as @xmath40 which will be satisfied by the solutions of the field equations as can be verified easily .",
    "the equations ( 3 ) , ( 8) - ( 10 ) and ( 12 ) are five independent equations with six unknowns @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath7 and @xmath0 . hence to get a realistic solution we assume that the expansion scalar @xmath41 in the model is proportional to the shear @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "this condition leads to the relation between metric potential @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a constant .    from equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 )",
    ", we have @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a constant of integration . using equation ( 14 ) in equation ( 15 ) and then integrating it we get the lime element ( 1 ) as @xmath47^{2/(n+3)}(dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 ) \\nonumber",
    "\\\\ -\\left[k_1 \\frac{(n+3)}{(1-n)}t + k_2(n+3)\\right]^{2n/(n+3 ) } d\\psi^{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by suitable changes of constants the line element ( 1 ) can be written as @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are two positive constants .",
    "for the model ( 17 ) , the spatial volume @xmath51 , matter density @xmath16 , pressure @xmath17 , gravitational parameter @xmath7 , cosmological parameter @xmath0 are given by @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56    the expansion scalar @xmath41 and shear @xmath42 are @xmath57 @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a positive constant .",
    "the critical density @xmath60 , vacuum density @xmath61 and density parameter @xmath62 are given by @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65    keeping in mind the form of the solution ( 18 ) , i.e. @xmath66 , one can express all the above parameters as function of the scale factor @xmath6 as well which we will follow in the following two sub - cases .",
    "for the radiation epoch , we have @xmath67 . in this case @xmath68",
    "@xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72    we observe that in this phase matter density is three times the vacuum density .",
    "the cosmic density parameter @xmath62 in this phase is @xmath73      for the phase dominated by dust matters , we have @xmath74 . in this epoch @xmath75",
    "@xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79",
    "in the present phenomenological study five dimensional kaluza - klein cosmological models with varying @xmath7 and @xmath0 are obtained .",
    "the models obtained present an expansion scalar @xmath41 bearing a constant ratio to the anisotropy in the direction of space like unit vector @xmath80 and with equation of state @xmath81 .",
    "if we inspect the solution set then it can be observed from the equation ( 18 ) that the spatial volume @xmath51 is zero at @xmath82 where @xmath83 and expansion scalar @xmath41 is infinite at @xmath84 which shows that the universe starts evolving with zero volume and infinite rate of expansion at @xmath82 .",
    "the scale factors also vanish at @xmath82 and hence the model has a _ point type _ singularity at the initial epoch . since @xmath85 is constant , as evident from the solutions ( 23 ) and ( 24 ) , the anisotropy does not die out asymptotically .",
    "the model admits a negative @xmath0 unless @xmath86 and these type of models for the universe with negative @xmath0 are available in the literature @xcite .",
    "we observe from the general solution set that for the stiff fluid ( @xmath86 ) the model reduces to standard kaluza - klein type zeldovich universe @xcite with @xmath87 , @xmath88 constant and @xmath89 for the limiting case @xmath90 ( figs . 1 & 2 ) . at @xmath91 limit all the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath0 , @xmath92 and @xmath41 are infinite in value , whereas all these become zero as @xmath93 .",
    "the ratio between cosmic matter density parameter @xmath94 and cosmic vacuum - energy density parameter @xmath95 scales as @xmath96 whereas cosmic vacuum - energy density parameter can be given as @xmath97    the above two expressions related to cosmic matter and vacuum density parameters do vanish for the stiff fluid condition @xmath86 .",
    "if we look at the solution expressed in the equation ( 21 ) then we can observe that in general @xmath9 .",
    "thus for the dust case ( @xmath74 ) this case is similar to the result of dirac @xcite , canuto et al .",
    "@xcite and beesham @xcite . on the other hand , equations ( 22 ) and ( 23 ) at once",
    "imply that @xmath98 for any constant values of @xmath5 and @xmath99 .",
    "again , from the solutions ( 18 ) and ( 22 ) one can find @xmath100 . on the other hand for the limiting case @xmath101 the equation ( 22 ) yields the relation @xmath2 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath102 , @xmath100 and @xmath2 which is in accordance with the main dynamical laws one finds in literature proposed for the decay of @xmath0 .",
    "note that we find all these phenomenological relations for @xmath0 directly from the solution set which generally consider as ad hoc basis in cosmological research .",
    "the dynamical law @xmath103 , has been proposed by carvalho et al . @xcite and considered by salim and waga @xcite , arbab and abdel - rahman @xcite , wetterich @xcite , arbab @xcite and very recently by ray and his collaborators as well as pradhan and his collaborators @xcite .",
    "the decay law of the form @xmath4 has been considered by arbab @xcite , khadekar et al .",
    "@xcite , ray et al .",
    "@xcite , ray and mukhopadhyay @xcite and ray et al . @xcite .",
    "the dynamical law @xmath2 has been considered by several authors , e.g. bertolami @xcite , berman and som @xcite , berman @xcite , beesham @xcite , pradhan et al .",
    "@xcite to mention a few .",
    "we observe that @xmath104 decays faster than @xmath7 where as @xmath17 , @xmath16 , @xmath105 , @xmath60 scales @xmath106 as can be seen from the figs . 1 - 4 . in the model",
    "we see that the quantity @xmath7 satisfies the condition for a machian cosmological solution i.e. @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "however , as far as the scenario of present accelerating universe is concern our models seems suffer a lot in connection to the different physical parameters , such as the deceleration parameter and the age of the universe .",
    "the deceleration parameter @xmath108 for the present model is @xmath109 and hence does not correspond to the observational result @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "however , we have observed that for the scale factor of the form @xmath111 we can have a negative deceleration parameter when @xmath112 . in our present case",
    "@xmath113 which yields @xmath114 . here the age of the universe is given by @xmath115 which is also differs from the present estimate @xmath116 gyr @xcite .",
    "this value , therefore , obviously suffers from the low age problem @xcite as even the oldest globular clusters show a value which is @xmath117 gyr @xcite . in this connection",
    "it is argued that dark energy models without @xmath0 suffer from low age problem @xcite though even in the presence of @xmath0 we are not in a hopeful position .",
    "one of the reasons of these discrepancies may be due to the constant nature of the equation of state parameter @xmath5 which can not accommodate with the present accelerating phase of the universe .",
    "however , this needs further investigation .",
    "the authors ( fr & sr ) is thankful to the authority of inter - university centre for astronomy and astrophysics , pune , india for providing visiting associateship under which a part of this work was carried out .",
    "we all are thankful to the referee for valuable suggestions which have enabled us to improve the manuscript substantially ."
