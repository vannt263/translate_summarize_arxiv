    "charge carriers introduced into the mott insulators induce a dramatic change of the electronic states .",
    "the high - temperature cuprate superconductor is a good example , where the spectral weight of the mott - gap excitation around @xmath4  ev in the optical conductivity , @xmath0 , decreases rapidly upon carrier doping and new weight emerges in the mid - infrared region accompanied with the increase of a zero - frequency component that corresponds to the dc conductivity .",
    "@xcite such a reconstruction of the electronic states would not occur in a conventional semiconductor .",
    "the electronic states of the cuprates are known to be well described by a single - band hubbard model with a large on - site coulomb interaction in two dimensions .",
    "numerous theoretical works have been done to understand the physics of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) hubbard model . among them ,",
    "the numerical diagonalization technique based on the lanczos algorithms has been intensively used for the investigation of the rapid spectral weight transfer seen in @xmath0 and other quantities .",
    "@xcite the doping dependence of @xmath0 for a @xmath5 cluster under periodic boundary conditions has clearly shown the reconstruction of the weight .",
    "@xcite however , the cluster significantly suffers from the finite - size effect .",
    "for example , the drude weight @xmath6 at half - filling , where the electron density @xmath7 ( 16 electrons in the cluster ) , becomes negative , and the ground state at @xmath8 ( 14 electrons ) is unphysically threefold degenerated .",
    "although @xmath6 seems to grow proportional to @xmath9 near half filling ,  @xcite this would not be conclusive because of these finite - size effects .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that @xmath6 in a @xmath3 cluster with mixed boundary conditions rather grows proportional to @xmath10 . in these situations , it is necessary to perform a systematic study of the optical conductivity by increasing the size of clusters .    in this paper , we perform the exact diagonalization study of @xmath0 in the 2d hubbard model up to a 20-site cluster .",
    "the diagonalization of the 20-site cluster has not been done in the past as far as we know .",
    "we compare @xmath0 for @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath1 clusters with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we find that at half - filling the 18- and 20-site results are similar in spectral shape but different from the 16-site result about the spectral weight distribution .",
    "the doping dependence of @xmath0 also shows similar behavior between the 18- and 20-site lattices . for the 20-site cluster ,",
    "we perform a systematic study of the doping dependence of the spectral - weight transfer , and find that the transferred weight from the mott - gap excitation increases with doping , showing a behavior qualitatively consistent with that observed experimentally .",
    "@xcite we also find that @xmath6 grows roughly proportional to @xmath9 near half - filling .",
    "these exact results can be useful in understanding the physics of the 2d hubbard model .",

    "the hamiltonian of the hubbard model in 2d reads as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the hopping energy , @xmath13 is the on - site coulomb interation , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath15 are the vectors connecting the nearest - neighbor sites in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 directions , respectively . the operator @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath21 at site @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "we apply the exact diagonalization method based on the lanczos technique to square clusters with periodic boundary conditions up to 20 sites .",
    "the size of the hilbert space to be diagonalized can be reduced by employing the translational and point - group symmetries of the clusters . in a @xmath3 cluster ,",

    "since the memory to be required for a single vector is 79  mb ( complex with double precision ) , a standard workstation ( pentium 4 , 2.67  ghz , 1  gb memory ) is enough for the lanczos diagonalization : the ground - state energy is obtained in 4  h by using our code .",
