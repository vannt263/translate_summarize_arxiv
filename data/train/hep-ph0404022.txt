    "the spontaneous growth and subsequent decay of these configurations emerging after a rapid chiral phase transition from the qgp to the hadronic world would give rise to large collective fluctuations in the number of produced low momentum neutral pions compared to charged pions .",
    "our work concentrates on the important question on the likelihood of an instability leading potentially to a large dcc yield of low momentum pions @xcite .",

    "we remark that this behaviour of ` overshooting '  as in the particular case of d1  is _ not _ observed in a simulation with a kinetic boltzmann equation .",

    "the third phase , i.e. the ` late ' time evolution is characterized by a smooth approach of the single momentum modes to their respective equilibrium values . as we will now explain , this phase is adequately characterized by chemical processes changing the ` number ' of ( quasi-)particles or excitations .",

    "can decay into three other particles . above ( approximately ) the threshold of @xmath36 these @xmath37 processes",
    "lead to an increase of the width ( as marked for the highest momentum mode by the second thin line ) .",
    "the inclusion of this part of the particle width in the spectral function is responsible for the process of chemical equilibration . within the kadanoff - baym scheme the off - shell @xmath37 transitions lead to a violation of ` particle number ' .",
    "the physical interpretation of the dynamics is a consistent treatment of bremsstrahlungs processes in the medium via the interplay of production , propagation and subsequent decay of highly virtual mode excitations .",
    "in this section we give a brief report on our findings on the stochastic nature of dcc formation and how to possibly identify their existence experimentally@xcite . this work resulted from an investigation@xcite , where we adressed the potential likeliness of an instability leading to a sufficiently large dcc event during the evolution of a fireball undergoing a phase transition within the linear @xmath38-model .",
    "the main idea is that the final fluctuations depend critically on the initial conditions chosen for the evolving chiral order parameter , thus deciding to some extent whether the system enters temporarily the instable region during the ` roll - down ' period of the order parameter@xcite .",
    "in fact , a semi - classical and dissipative dynamics of the order parameter and the pionic fields can be obtained by an effective and complex action , where the interaction with the thermal pions has been integrated out . to the end , we have utilized the following stochastic langevin equations of motion for the order parameters @xmath39 in a d - dimensional ( ` hubble ' ) expanding volume @xmath40 to describe the evolution of collective pion and sigma fields@xcite : @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 being the chiral meson fields and @xmath44 denotes the effective transversal ( ` pionic ' ) masses .",
    "these coupled langevin equations resemble in its structure a phenomenological ginzburg - landau description of phase transition . aside from a theoretical justification one",
    "can regard the langevin equation as a practical tool to study the effect of thermalization on a subsystem , to sample a large set of possible trajectories in the evolution , and to address also the question of all thermodynamically possible initial configurations in a systematic manner .    in fig .",
    "[ dccfig1 ] we show the statistical distribution in the number of produced long wavelength pions @xmath45 out of the evolving chiral order fields within the dcc domain @xmath40 for one particular set of parameters@xcite .",
    "a rather rapid and ( @xmath46)3-dimensional expansion has been employed .",
    "( the results majorly depend on how fast the assumed cooling and expansion proceeds . ) in general one finds that only for d=3 and sufficiently fast expansion individual unusual strong fluctuations of the order of 50 - 200 pions might occur , although the average number @xmath47 of the emerging long wavelength pions only posesses a moderate and _ undetectable _ value of 5 -20 .    in these interesting cases",
    "the final distribution does _ not _ follow a usual poissonian distribution ( comp .",
    "[ dccfig1 ] ) , which represents a very important outcome .",
    "( critical , dynamical ) fluctuations with a large number of produced pions are still likely with some small but finite probability",
    "! unusual events out of sample contain a multiple in the number of pions compared to the average .",
    "one can interpret those particular events as semi - classical ` pion bursts ' similar to the mystique centauro candidates .",
    "if dccs are being produced , an experimental finding will be a rare event following a strikingly , nontrivial and nonpoissonian distribution .",
    "a dedicated event - by - event analysis for the experimental programs ( e.g. the star tpc at rhic ) is then unalterable .",
    "the further analysis of this unusual distribution by means of the cumulant expansion shows that the reduced higher order factorial cumulants + @xmath48 for @xmath5 exhibit an abnormal , exponentially increasing tendency , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dccfig2 ] .",
    "there an additional incoherent poissonian background of ( low momentum ) pions stemming from other possible sources has been added .",
    "we advocate that an analysis by means of the higher order cumulants serves as a powerful signature . in conclusion , the occurence of a rapid chiral phase transition ( and thus dccs ) can be identified experimentally by inspecting higher order facorial cumulants @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) for taken distributions of low momentum pions .",
    "a major goal of the experiments at rhic and lhc is the creation and observation of the quark - gluon - plasma . to describe the dynamics of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions ( urhics ) , and to address the crucial question of thermalization and early pressure build up ,",
    "we have developed a kinetic parton cascade algorithm @xcite inspired by perturbative qcd including inelastic ( ` bremsstrahlung ' ) collisions @xmath49 besides elastic collisions .",
    "it is the aim to get a more detailed and quantitative understanding of the early dynamical stages of deconfined matter and to test various initial conditions for the liberated gluons , than envoking ad hoc varoius phenomenological , hydrodynamical ansaetze .",
    "an parton cascade analysis incorporating only binary @xmath35 collisions described via direct pqcd scattering processes shows that thermalization and early quasi - hydrodynamic behaviour ( for achieving sufficient elliptic flow ) can not be buildt up or maintained , but only if a much higher cross section is being employed @xcite .",
    "the possible importance of the inelastic reactions was indeed raised in the so called ` bottom up thermalization ' picture @xcite .",
    "it is intuitively clear that gluon multiplication should lead to a faster equilibration .    in developing the algorithm special emphasis",
    "is put on obeying the principle of detailed balance among the gain and loss contributions .",
    "the standard incorporation of @xmath35 scattering processes in a transport description is based on the geometric interpretation of the cross section @xcite . for large particle densities",
    ", however , such an implementation leads to considerable problems to generate a causal collision sequence among the various partons , leading to a severe reduction of the collision rate compared to the one dictated by the boltzmann equation , see fig .",
    "[ box1 ] . in principle",
    ", this can be cured by the test particle method . however , for such a situation the stochastic method ( see eg @xcite ) is better suited to solve the boltzmann equation directly via transition rates in sufficiently small spatial cells , see fig .",
    "[ box1 ] . here",
    "the actual collision rate being realized in the simulation fully equals the ideal one of the boltzmann equation which shall be simulated .",
    "one can go to arbitrary high density .",
    "moreover , this method can , in principle , be generalized to ( any ) multi - particle scattering processes .    to demonstrate the applicability of the method",
    ", we show in the following the formation of a quark gluon plasma within a fixed box and study the way of kinetic and chemical equilibration for different parton species .",
    "the initial conditions of the partons entering the cascade are given by the multiple minijets ( partons with @xmath50 gev / c ) production @xcite from the binary nucleon - nucleon - scattering in a nucleus - nucleus - collision according to the differential jet cross section : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the transverse momentum and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the rapidities of the produced partons .",
    "the minijets are considered in the central rapidity interval @xmath55 at rhic energy of @xmath56 gev .",
    "the initial partons are distributed uniformly in a cubic box of size 3 fm , which approximately corresponds to the central region of heavy ion collions at some early initial time .",
    "we consider here gluon and quarks with two flavors as parton species .",
    "collision processes are the two - body elementary parton - parton scatterings and three - body process @xmath49 in leading - order of pqcd , employing effective landau - pomeranchuk - migdal suppression and standard screening masses for the infrared sector of the scattering amplitude .",
    "[ box2 ] shows the time evolution of the gluon and quark number .",
    "gluon equilibration undergoes two stages : at first the gluon number increases rapidly and then smoothly evolves to its final equilibrium value together with the quark number at a much lower rate .",
    "the early stage of gluon production also leads to an immediate kinetic equilibration of the momentum distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ box3 ] and fig .",
    "[ box5 ] ) as well as to a rather abrupt lowering of the temperature by soft gluon emission until detailed balance among gain and loss contributions is reached ( see fig .",
    "[ box4 ] ) .",
    "the later slower evolution is then governed by chemical equilibration of the quark degrees of freedom .",
    "the final temperature of fig .",
    "[ box4 ] is identical to the late slope parameter of the energy spectra depicted in fig .",

    "[ minijet ] we depict one such first ( and still _ preliminary _ , as yet not fully tested ) calculation with minijet initial conditions .",
    "thermalization and chemical equilibration as propoesed in the bottom up picture @xcite can then thoroghly be tested within this approach .",
    "furthermore we will study the impact parameter dependence of the transverse energy in order to understand elliptic and transverse flow at rhic within this new scheme of a kinetic parton cascade including inelastic interactions by comparing to experimental data .",
