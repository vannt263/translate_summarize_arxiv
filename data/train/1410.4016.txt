    "over the last few years there has been a great deal of interest in studying the many - body physics of strongly correlated spins - bosons lattice models using a table top experimental quantum - optical systems @xcite .",
    "a prominent example is the recent experimental demonstration of the quantum phase transition from mott insulator state to superfluid state of spin - boson excitations in a system of trapped ions @xcite .",
    "it was shown that with the spontaneous breaking of continuous @xmath0 symmetry at the quantum phase transition in such models , including for example jaynes - cummings - hubbard system @xcite and dicke - like system @xcite , two - types of collective excitations emerge .",
    "one is the the gapless goldstone mode , and the other is the gapped amplitude mode corresponding to phase and density fluctuations .",
    "such amplitude modulation of the order parameter is referred to as higgs mode generated by a physical mechanism analogous as the higgs boson in high energy physics .",
    "recently , the amplitude mode was experimentally observed in a system of strongly interacting condensate of ultracold atoms near the superfluid - insulator phase transition @xcite opened fascinating prospect for exploring the condensed matter excitations under controlled conditions .    in this work",
    "we present study of the collective hybrid spin - boson excitations in the cooperative jahn - teller ( cjt ) model .",
    "originally , the jahn - teller model was introduced to explain the distortions and the nondegenerate energy levels in molecules , via the strong interaction between the localized electronic states and the vibrations of the nuclei @xcite . in solids ,",
    "the cjt effect leads to structural phase transition and magnetic ordering of the spins .",
    "furthermore , the collective effects induced by the jahn - teller coupling may explain the transition of some solids , such as fullerene compounds , to high - temperature superconductors @xcite . with the current quantum optical technologies the cjt model",
    "can be realized in laser or magnetically driven ion crystal @xcite and cavity / circuit qed systems based on superconducting qubits in transmission line resonators @xcite .",
    "here we focus on @xmath1 jahn - teller model which possess continuous @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "we use path integral approach to describe analytically the quantum magnetic structural phase transition with the formation of bosonic condensates and magnetic ordering of the spins in the cjt model . within the framework of the saddle - point approximation",
    "we determine the mean - field solution and then consider the quantum fluctuations around the mean - field result .",
    "we show that the energy spectrum of the cjt system consists of three collective excitations branches . in the symmetry broken phase we find a linear gapless goldstone mode and two gapped amplitude modes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ cjtm ] we introduce the cjt model and consider the associated continuous @xmath0 symmetry . in sec .",
    "[ implementation ] we discuss a possible scheme for the experimental realization of the cjt model using quantum optical systems . in sec .",
    "[ pif ] we turn to the path integral treatment of the model and determine its saddle - point . in sec .",
    "[ qf ] we consider the quantum fluctuations around the mean - field solution and find the elementary excitations of the cjt model . in sec .",
    "[ mp ] we discuss many - body spectroscopy protocol to detect the quantum phases and the collective excitations .",
    "finally , the conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "we consider a chain of @xmath2 spins with states @xmath3 , @xmath4 each one coupled symmetrically with two boson species ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 from now on ) , @xmath7 the term @xmath8 describes the energy of the effective spins with frequency @xmath9 , where @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) are the pauli matrices for the spin at site @xmath12 .",
    "note that this term also can represent the coupling with applied external magnetic field . the tight - binding term @xmath13 describes the delocalization of the two bosonic species @xmath5 between different lattice sites with hopping matrix elements @xmath14 and on - site boson energy @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the respective creation and annihilation operators of boson at site @xmath12 .",
    "the last term in ( [ hcjt ] ) describes the @xmath1 symmetrical jahn - teller interaction between the spins and two boson species with coupling strength @xmath18 .",
    "alternatively , the spin - boson interaction can be expressed in terms of right @xmath19 and left @xmath20 chiral operators , which yield @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the corresponding spin raising and lowering operators .",
    "we note that because of the contra - rotating terms @xmath23 and @xmath24 in ( [ hi ] ) the total number of spin and boson excitations is not conserved . instead of that , the hamiltonian @xmath25 commute with the operator @xmath26 .",
    "the latter implies that the cjt hamiltonian ( [ hcjt ] ) possesses continuous @xmath0 symmetry implemented by the action of the operator @xmath27 , which gives @xmath28 such that we have @xmath29 . finally , it is convenient to work in representation , where the tight - binding term @xmath13 in ( [ hcjt ] ) is diagonal . indeed , performing the transformation in to the momentum space @xmath30 , ( @xmath31 from now on ) , where @xmath32 are the normal mode wave functions yield @xmath33 with @xmath34 being the collective mode energies .",
    "hereafter we assume that @xmath35 with minimum at @xmath36 corresponding to the center - of - mass mode .    in the following we discuss the realization of the cjt model using quantum optical systems .",
    "the cjt model comprises of two bosonic species and spin degrees of freedom , the specific interpretation of which depends on the actual physical system . one possible experimental setup for the realization of the model is based on the laser cooled trapped ions @xcite . in that case",
    "the bosonic degrees of freedom represent the local phonons , which quantify the small radial ion oscillations around the equilibrium positions @xcite .",
    "the hopping term @xmath13 in ( [ hcjt ] ) describes the coulomb - mediated long - range phonon hopping dynamics with hopping elements @xmath37 and on - site frequency @xmath15 .",
    "the spins are implemented by the internal two metastable levels of the trapped ions where @xmath9 is the effective spin frequency .",
    "the desired jahn - teller coupling can be realized by the interaction of the spins with an oscillating magnetic field gradient @xcite .",
    "alternative realization of the jahn - teller coupling is based on the interaction of the ions with laser beams propagating in two orthogonal directions tuned near the respective red and blue sidebands @xcite .",
    "the ion trap based realization of the cjt model offers unique opportunity to easy tuning the parametric regime of the couplings by adjusting for example the trap frequencies and the laser intensity .",
    "although with the current ion technologies the realization of the model is restricted to one - dimension where the ions are placed in a chain , considerable progress is achieved to scaling to two - dimensional ion trap network where the ions are trapped in individual potential wells @xcite .    on the other hand lattice spin - boson models",
    "can be realized naturally in cavity and circuit qed systems @xcite . here",
    "the bosons represent a single or several quantized modes inside of an electromagnetic resonators , while the spin degrees of freedom are implemented either by real two - level atom , or artificial atoms such as quantum dot or superconducting circuit .",
    "recently it was shown that the interaction between the quantum dot @xcite or superconducting circuit @xcite with two cavity modes leads to the jahn - teller coupling .",
    "arranging atoms and resonators in the form of lattice can realize our model ( [ hcjt ] ) , with coupling between the resonators provided by the photon hopping .    in the next section",
    ", we turn to the field - theoretical treatment of the cjt model .",
    "this method allows us to determine the stationary saddle - point of the model and then consider the small fluctuations around the mean - field result .",
    "in the functional integral treatment , the second quantized hamiltonian of the model is translated to the phase representation with the help of the path integral formalism . in this approach",
    "the boson operators are replaced with their associated fields , namely @xmath38 , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the imaginary time @xcite . for the spin - degrees of freedom",
    "we choose a spin - coherent representation with coherent - state parameterized by the independent polar @xmath41 and azimuthal @xmath42 angles , respectively , @xmath43 the spin operators are replaced by the corresponding bloch vector @xmath44 $ ] whose components are the expectation values of the pauli matrices with respect to the state ( [ nvector ] ) which gives @xmath45.\\ ] ] the bloch vector has a unit length @xmath46 and specifies the orientation of spin at site @xmath12 . having this in hand the partition function for the cjt model can be expressed as @xmath47 with the euclidian action given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the inverse temperature .",
    "the berry phase contribution to the action ( [ s ] ) from the spin - degrees of freedom is given by @xmath50 finally , we require that the corresponding bosonic fields have periodic boundary conditions @xmath51 and @xmath52 . the same condition is hold and for the spin variables , where we have @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "next we consider the classical equation of motion , which are determined by the condition , that the variation of the action ( [ s ] ) with respect to the field variables should vanish , @xmath55 note that the same condition is also satisfied for the bosonic field @xmath56 .",
    "the term classical refers to a mean - field solution , i.e. , disregarding the quantum fluctuations .",
    "the variation of the action @xmath57 with respect of the spin - degrees of freedom gives the following equations of motion @xmath58 where the dynamics follow from the berry phase term ( [ berry ] ) .",
    "the third condition in ( [ var ] ) reads @xmath59 we note that because the action @xmath57 ( [ s ] ) is invariant with respect to @xmath0 transformation specified in eq .",
    "( [ symmetry ] ) , the corresponding equations of motion ( [ spin_eq ] ) and ( [ alpha ] ) obey the same symmetry . although the eq . ( [ spin_eq ] ) describes the dynamics of the spin - degree of freedom it is not expressed in terms of @xmath60 .",
    "one way to remedy this is to introduce a new set of two orthogonal to @xmath60 vectors , namely @xmath61 $ ] and @xmath62 $ ] which form an orthogonal triad @xmath63 . then the eq .",
    "( [ spin_eq ] ) is rewritten as follows @xmath64 here we have introduce the vector notation @xmath65 $ ] for the two bosonic fields .",
    "finally , one can combine the two equations in ( [ spin1 ] ) in a vector form which yield @xmath66 where we use @xmath67 .",
    "now we are in position to interpret the dynamical equation for the spins .",
    "the first term in ( [ spin_vector ] ) represent the effect of the externally applied magnetic field along the @xmath68 direction , @xmath69 $ ] , such that for @xmath70 the spins will perform precession with frequency determined by @xmath9 . on the other hand",
    "the spin - boson interaction gives rise to an effective magnetic field @xmath71 experienced by the spin at lattice site @xmath12 . in the case",
    "when the bosonic fields describe the motional degrees of freedom of the spins in two orthogonal directions , the effective magnetic field @xmath71 becomes position - dependent , which is in close analogy with the rashba spin - orbit coupling in the quantum spin hall effect @xcite . because the vectors @xmath72 and @xmath71 are always orthogonal ,",
    "the spins execute precession along the axis @xmath73 to both magnetic fields .",
    "we note that although eq .",
    "( [ spin_vector ] ) is purely local in a sense that it only depends on the lattice index @xmath12 , the components of @xmath71 depend on the boson fields at different sites due to the tunneling elements @xmath37 . as we will see below such a tight - binding lattice dynamics of the two bosonic species strongly coupled to the spins are capable of forming magnetic ordering and bosonic condensates .",
    "the stationary saddle - point is obtained by the solution of eq .",
    "( [ var ] ) with the requirement that @xmath74 and @xmath75",
    ". then we derive the following set of algebraic equations for the spin - degrees of freedom @xmath76 where @xmath77 and respectively for the bosonic fields @xmath78 apparently , the system ( [ mf_s ] ) has a trivial solution @xmath79 for ( @xmath80 ) which implies @xmath81 . assuming @xmath82 , the condition @xmath83 solved the second equation in ( [ mf_s ] ) .",
    "the latter is the arbitrary choice for a direction of spontaneous symmetry breaking where the system chooses a direction along which to order .",
    "hear after we assume @xmath84 , such that the bloch vector becomes @xmath85 $ ] indicating that the spins are aligned in the @xmath86 plane .",
    "let us now discuss the homogenous limit @xmath87 neglecting any boundary effect .",
    "in this limit eqs .",
    "( [ mf_s ] ) and ( [ mf_b ] ) can be solved exactly , which yield @xmath88 the solution ( [ sp ] ) corresponds to the classical ground - state of the cjt model . for a coupling smaller than the critical value of @xmath89 ( @xmath90 )",
    "the system is in a normal state where the bloch vector for each spin points along the @xmath91 direction and @xmath81 . increasing the coupling through @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) drives the system to undergo a quantum phase transition to a ferromagnetic ordering of spins in @xmath86 plane and condensation of the two boson species in the lowest energy mode @xmath36 . here",
    "we emphasize that for a linear ion crystal with positive hopping amplitude the saddle - point approximation is not applied straightforward .",
    "this problem can be overcome by applying a canonical transformation to the operators @xmath94 and @xmath95 in ( [ hcjt ] ) @xcite . after this transformation to the staggered spin - boson basis the cjt model ( [ hcjt ] ) is unchanged , but the tunneling is modified to @xmath96 .",
    "the ferromagnetic spin order in the new basis , corresponds to an antiferromagnetic order in the physical basis , in which ions alternate spin direction and position .    in the following section we study the low - energy spectra of the cjt model in terms of collective excitations .",
    "we expand the action of the system around its saddle - point up to second order in the spin and bosonic fields .",
    "this leads to a gaussian integral which can be evaluated .",
    "having described the saddle - point solution , we now consider the low - energy excitations of the cjt model in the symmetry - broken phase . for the bosonic fields we can use the standard linear parametrization @xmath97 where @xmath98 describes the quantum fluctuations around the order parameter @xmath99 . in order to account the spin fluctuations around the state @xmath100 for each spin at site @xmath12 we first perform rotation of the bloch vector @xmath101 with rotation matrix given by    .",

    "the rotation matrix @xmath108 is determined in a such a way that transform @xmath100 to a new reference bloch vector @xmath109 $ ] which points along the @xmath68 direction .",
    "assuming that the spin and bosonic fluctuations are small in a sense that one can keep only the quadratic terms , such that @xmath110 we obtain @xmath111 where the linear terms in the field fluctuations vanishes due to the conditions eqs .",
    "( [ mf_s ] ) and ( [ mf_b ] ) for @xmath93 . here",
    "@xmath112 is the renormalised spin frequency and @xmath113 is the berry phase term in the rotating basis .",
    "note that the @xmath113 is invariant with respect to the rotation transformation , which implies that @xmath114 .",
    "up to quadratic terms in the spin fluctuation fields the berry phase can be written as @xmath115 we emphasize that in order to describe the collective excitations around the mean - field solution one needs to identify the number of conjugate pairs . in our model",
    "presented here the bosonic fields @xmath116 and @xmath117 in ( [ s_f ] ) are canonically conjugate variables , which leads to two independent degree of freedom . on the other hand the pairs @xmath118 and @xmath119 represent conjugate quantities corresponding to the spin fluctuations , which implies that one can expect in total three collective modes . in order to obtain the low - energy excitations , it is convenient to transform the spin fields in the momentum representation using @xmath120 and @xmath121 , which yield @xmath122 the action ( [ s_k ] ) is quadratic in the field fluctuations , which lead to gaussian functional integral . to diagonalize ( [ s_k ] )",
    "one can introduce harmonic oscillator degrees of freedom for each pair of conjugate variables , such that we obtain ( see , appendix [ a ] ) @xmath123 where the coupling matrix @xmath124 is given by @xmath125,\\label{b_matrix}\\]]with @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the dispersion relation of field fluctuations around the ground - state configuration , i.e. , the collective spin - boson excitations , can be found by solving the eigenvalue problem @xmath128 with @xmath129 .",
    "the result is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where are shown the three branches of collective excitations , assuming periodic boundary conditions with nearest - neighbours bosonic tunneling @xmath130 and bosonic dispersion @xmath131 @xcite .",

    "such a treatment allows us to connect the density fluctuations and the local phase of the condensates with the creation of the energy gaps in the spectra of cjt model . a convenient way to do",
    "this is to adopt the polar parametrization of the bosonic fields .",
    "let us choose the nonlinear polar parametrization @xmath138 of the bosonic fields entering the path integral ( [ s ] ) . here",
    "the conjugate variables @xmath139 and @xmath140 describe , respectively , the local phase and the density fluctuation of the bosonic condensates around the mean - field solution @xmath141 . in the limit of @xmath142",
    "one can expand the square root in eq .",
    "( [ polar ] ) and keep only the quadratic terms of the density fluctuations .",
    "the latter condition can be fulfilled for large coupling @xmath143 ( @xmath144 ) , where the quantum fluctuations are suppressed @xcite .",
    "assuming that the spin and bosonic fields vary smoothly on the scale of lattice constant @xmath145 in a @xmath146 dimensional cubic lattice one can perform gradient expansion , such that in the symmetry broken phase @xmath147 the continuum action becomes @xmath148 observe that the term @xmath149 corresponds to the kinetic energy of a free particle with quadratic dispersion relation @xmath150 .",
    "additionally , the spontaneous symmetry breaking gives rise to terms proportional to @xmath151 such that the system gain an energy gaps which are not vanish in the limit @xmath152 . as a result of that the conjugate pairs @xmath153 and @xmath154 lead to two gapped amplitude modes in the spectra of cjt model .",
    "indeed , the subsequent diagonalization of the action ( [ s_con ] ) in the position - momentum representation gives an identical to @xmath124 matrix eq .",
    "( [ b_matrix ] ) where the bosonic dispersion is replaced by its long - wave length limit , @xmath155 .",
    "at the end we discuss the experimental verifiability of the presented results . for concreteness , we focus on the trapped ion - based realization of the cjt model .",
    "the protocol starts with the initialization of the linear ion crystal in the normal phase ground - state @xmath70 , by laser cooling of the radial phonons to the motional ground - state and pumping spins to @xmath4 state .",
    "after that the jahn - teller coupling is switched on and increases adiabatically to the desired regime @xmath93 . the quantum magnetic structural phase transition predicted by the mean - field solution ( [ sp ] ) can be detected by measuring either the spin population or the phonon number .",
    "the antiferromagnetic spin order can be verified experimentally using a spin - dependent laser fluorescence , where the spins in the upper state emit light and appear bright , while the spins on the down state remain dark .",
    "the structural phase transition is related with the position reordering of the ion crystal into the zigzag configuration and creation of phonons in the lowest energy vibrational mode .",
    "these can be measured by laser induced fluorescence , which is imaged on a ccd camera and , respectively , with sideband spectroscopy which allows to determine the mean phonon number @xcite . finally ,",
    "following the recent proposals @xcite , the dispersion relations of the excitations can be measured by the dynamical response of the system due to the weak coupling to the quantum probe .",
    "in conclusion , we have provided the path - integral formalism of the cjt model . within the saddle - point approximation",
    "we have obtained the classical ground - state of the cjt model .",
    "the solution predicts a quantum magnetic structural phase transition with formation of ferromagnetic spin order and condensations of the two bosonic species in the lowest energy mode . we have calculated the elementary excitations of our model and found a linear gapless goldstone mode and two gapped amplitude modes in the symmetry - broken phase .",
