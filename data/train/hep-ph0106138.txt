    "versus the standard model s ( sm ) @xmath0 decay helicity amplitudes , three numerical puzzles occur at the @xmath1 level when one considers the amplitudes in the case of an additional @xmath2 coupling of relative strength @xmath3 [ 1 ] .",
    "the puzzles are theoretical ones which involve the @xmath0 decay helicity amplitudes in the two cases , the relative strength of the additional @xmath5 coupling , and the observed masses of these three particles ( see discussion at end of this section ) .",
    "while the observed mass - values of the top - quark , w - boson , and b - quark are involved here , it is not a matter of presently available empirical data disagreeing with a sm prediction .",
    "the puzzles arose in a search for empirical ambiguities between the standard model s @xmath6 coupling and possible single additional lorentz couplings that could occur in the ongoing [ 2 ] and forthcoming [ 3,4 ] top - quark decay experiments at hadron and @xmath7 colliders .",
    "in this paper we report analytic realizations of these three numerical puzzles . there are four types of analytical relations which are listed below as ( i)-(iv ) in section 2 .    for 1em @xmath8 ,",
    "the most general lorentz coupling is @xmath9 where @xmath10 , and @xmath11 @xmath12 for a most general treatment of additional lorentz structures to pure @xmath13 , the @xmath14 or @xmath15 must be considered as complex phenomenological parameters .    to avoid confusion , two notational details",
    "should be noted in our usage of eqs .",
    "( 1,2 ) in this paper : first , we will more often use chiral combinations of the couplings which are defined by @xmath16 @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( for others see appendix ) .",
    "second , to avoid cumbersome notation and verbiage , we find it very convenient to suppress the analogous subscript on the effective mass - scales , @xmath19 .",
    "for example , in ( 1 ) a reader might choose to write @xmath20 as @xmath21 .",
    "however , a smarter reader would realize that in the analysis in this paper for each @xmath22 value only the ratio of @xmath14 and @xmath19 ever occurs so one could just omit the @xmath19 by completely absorbing it into its @xmath14 .",
    "nevertheless , we proceed a little differently : we use the unsubscripted @xmath23 s in ( 1,2 ) which does keep track of the mass - dimensions and then we subscript them when we must . for instance",
    ", whenever we use ",
    "@xmath24 units with @xmath25 \" , we do move the corresponding subscript from the @xmath14 to its @xmath15 .",
    "in essence , this is but a slight variation on the smarter reader s procedure but one which , we believe , is worthwhile in this paper .",
    "for present purposes , referring to a @xmath15 scale in  @xmath24 units with @xmath25 \" is a simple way to characterize the size and sign of the additional effective @xmath26 coupling .",
    "[ when a fundamental theory leads to a specific coupling in ( 1,2 ) , both @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and not just their ratio , would normally be independently defined and observable . in general",
    ", one would then not want to omit either such quantity nor any such subscripts ! a more fundamental or more general realization of electroweak symmetry in the context of the sm might also yield deviations from @xmath29 limit but we do not consider that possibility here . ]    as discussed in greater detail in the earliest paper in [ 1 ] , the various couplings in ( 1,2 ) are not lorentz independent . in particular , to obtain the identical @xmath30 amplitudes as for the pure @xmath13 coupling of the sm , there is a dominant scale of @xmath31 and there is a negligible ( for @xmath32 amplitudes ) scale @xmath33 .",
    "these scales are , of course , not to be confused with those for the 2  dynamical phase - type ambiguities \" [ 1 ] discussed below in this section in association with table 1 ; the  ambiguity scale \" for the additional lorentz structure is respectively @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "these various coupling scales can be compared with the sm s ew scale @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the higgs field .",
    "these scales can also be compared with the  few tev \" cut - off scale needed to control the one - loop quadratic - divergent radiative corrections which arise in the higgs mass renormalization in the sm ; this  few tev \" scale thereby occurs in the susy and technicolor generalizations of the sm .    in the @xmath38 rest frame ,",
    "the matrix element for @xmath39 is @xmath40 where @xmath41 in terms of the @xmath42 and @xmath43-quark helicities .",
    "the helicity amplitudes , @xmath44 , corresponding to the couplings in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are listed in the appendix .",
    "we will denote respectively the  standard model s \" and the  @xmath45 \" coupling s amplitudes by an ( sm ) and ( + ) subscript .    in ( 3 ) , the asterisk denotes complex conjugation .",
    "the final @xmath46 momentum is in the @xmath47 direction and the @xmath43-quark momentum is in the opposite direction .",
    "@xmath48 gives the @xmath38-quark s spin component quantized along the @xmath49 axis .",
    "@xmath48 is also the helicity of the @xmath38-quark if one has boosted , along the ",
    "@xmath50 \" direction , back to the @xmath38 rest frame from the @xmath51 frame .",
    "it is this boost which defines the @xmath49 axis in the @xmath38-quark rest frame for angular analysis [ 1 ] .    to be able to quantitatively assess future measurements of competing observables in @xmath52 decay , we considered in [ 1 ] the @xmath53 coupling values of helicity decay parameters versus those for ",
    "@xmath6 @xmath54 single additional lorentz structures .",
    "\" versus the sm s dominant l - handed @xmath43-quark amplitudes , there are 2 dynamical phase - type ambiguities produced respectively by an additional @xmath55 and by an additional @xmath4 coupling , see the @xmath56 and @xmath57 columns of table 1 . for a reader interested in more details about this table ,",
    "we note that in the earliest reference in [ 1 ] , this same table is discussed at length in association with another table with the corresponding consequences for the observable helicity parameters for @xmath58 decay in the cases that the observed top - quark is coupled respectively by  @xmath59 \" and  @xmath60 \" . by tuning the effective - mass - scale associated with the additional coupling constant ,",
    "the additional @xmath55 coupling , @xmath5 coupling , has respectively changed the sign of the @xmath56 , @xmath61 amplitude . in @xmath62 units ,",
    "the respective effective - mass scales are @xmath63 , @xmath35 .",
    "the occurrence of these two ambiguities is not surprising because these 3 chiral combinations only contribute to the l - handed b - quark amplitudes as @xmath64 .",
    "however , associated with the latter @xmath4 ambiguity , 3 very interesting numerical puzzles arose at the @xmath65 level in the  ( + ) \" amplitudes versus the sm s pure @xmath66 amplitudes , see table 1 :    the 1st puzzle is that the @xmath67 amplitude for @xmath68 has the same value in @xmath69 units , as the @xmath70 amplitude in the sm ; see the corresponding two  220 \" entries in the top of table 1 . from the empirical t - quark and w - boson mass values",

    "note versus theoretical interpretation of this mass relation that @xmath81 is very small and not of order one .",
    "[ the @xmath65 level of agreement of the two  220 \" entries of table 1 is due to the present central value of @xmath82 , and to the central value and @xmath83 precision of @xmath84 .",
    "the error in the empirical value of the mass ratio @xmath75 is dominated by the current @xmath85 precision of @xmath86 . ]",
    "the 2nd and 3rd numerical puzzles are the occurrence of the same magnitudes of the two r - handed b - quark amplitudes @xmath87 for the sm and for the case of @xmath88 .",
    "this is shown in the @xmath89 and @xmath90 columns in the bottom half of table 1 .",
    "except for the differing partial width , @xmath91 versus @xmath92 , by tuning the magnitude of l - handed amplitude ratio to that of the sm , we found that the r - handed amplitude s moduli became those of the sm to the @xmath93 level .",
    "[ as explained below following ( 8) , for @xmath94 the magnitudes of these two r - handed moduli are actually exactly equal and not merely numerically equal to the @xmath93 level . ]",
    "notice that due to the additional @xmath95 coupling , it is the @xmath96 helicity amplitudes @xmath97 which get an overall sign change .",
    "the first three of the four analytical relations , ( i)-(iv ) below , are a deeper realization of the just discussed 2nd and 3rd numerical puzzles : the first type of relation is ( i ) : @xmath98 this holds separately for @xmath99(sm ) , ( + ) .",
    "( i ) relates the two amplitudes which change or ",
    "flip \" sign , i.e. the amplitudes with @xmath100 , to the two amplitudes which do not in the case of the 3 numerical puzzles .",
    "the second type of relation is ( ii ) : @xmath101 notice that this relation relates the @xmath8 amplitudes in the two cases , ( sm ) and ( + ) .",
    "( ii ) is for the sign - flip amplitudes , c.f .",
    "table 1 , but the analogous relation holds for the non - sign - flip amplitudes .",
    "[ this non - sign - flip relation is not independent of ( i ) and ( ii ) ; it follows by simply substituting ( 4 ) with respectively @xmath99(+ ) , ( sm ) on each side of ( 5 ) . ]",
    "these 3 equations , the two in ( 4 ) and one in ( 5 ) , occur to all orders in the @xmath75 and @xmath74 mass ratios .",
    "( 5 ) and the ( + ) one in ( 4 ) are also independent of the effective - mass scale @xmath102 .",
    "this independence with respect to specific values of @xmath103 and @xmath102 is an analytic generalization of the numerical agreement discussed in section 1 . due to ( ii ) , the two equations in ( i ) imply but are stronger than simply an independent equality of the ratios of the ( sm ) and ( + ) amplitudes which do / do - not change sign , i.e. the existence of 3 equations is also a stronger result than is apparent from only the 2nd and 3rd numerical puzzles .    on the other hand , the two equations in ( i ) can be rewritten to relate the ratios of left - handed and right - handed amplitudes for each coupling , that is @xmath104 for @xmath99(sm ) , ( + ) .",
    "consequently , by determining the effective mass scale @xmath105 so that there is an exact equality for the ratio of left - handed amplitudes ( iii ) : @xmath106 the normalized @xmath107 amplitudes for the sm and for the case of a @xmath108 coupling are all exactly equal in magnitude to all orders in @xmath75 and @xmath74 , with @xmath3 . from ( 7 ) , in @xmath109 units , the analytic formula for @xmath102 is @xmath110\\ ] ] or equivalently , @xmath94 where @xmath111 is the energy of the final w - boson in the t - rest frame .",
    "eq.(7 ) is the third type of relation ; it requires ( 8) to hold whereas ( i ) and ( ii ) do not .",
    "therefore , due to ( i ) and ( ii ) , relation ( iii ) implies an s - matrix probability condition that the @xmath112 amplitudes are * exactly equal * in magnitude between the sm and ( + ) case , to all orders in the two mass ratios .",
    "only the actual value of this new ew scale @xmath3 depends on the empirical values of @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and the fact that the @xmath115 ratio is small .",
    "this s - matrix  locking mechanism \" for arbitrary @xmath74 and @xmath75 , as described by relations ( i ) thru ( iii ) , supports the simple interpretation that the 2nd and 3rd numerical puzzles arise due to a large chiral weak - moment of the top quark .",
    "although a large chiral weak - moment , @xmath116 , changes the @xmath117 to @xmath118 transition amplitude , it does not drastically effect the @xmath119 x @xmath120 gauge structure . with present knowledge , it is also less radical to consider an unexpected intrinsic property of the top - quark itself , i.e. an anomalous  moment \" , instead of a tree - level occurrence of an additional ew coupling .",
    "the sm is a theory , being renormalizable and unitary .",
    "in such a framework , an anomalous moment coupling implies other new physics , e.g. new particle production , at an effective mass scale of @xmath121 .",
    "unfortunately in regard to detailed predictions , such models are rather non - unique in regard to the particle multiplets and their associated couplings ; they are also complex and complicated in regard to a satisfactory treatment of higher order effects . here",
    "the additional r - chirality t - quark weak coupling could be problematic given ( i ) the successful agreements of the sm through the one - loop level versus ew observables and ( ii ) the sm s self - consistency of 3 point - like fermion families ; however , due to possible form - factor effects there need not be any inconsistencies .",
    "when there is additional empirical information on @xmath122 and if , for instance , a deeper exact symmetry were found which yields the twb - transformation , see ( 10 ) below , this should expedite development of a theory with a top - quark with a large chiral weak - moment .",
    "the final type of relation is simply the first numerical puzzle , i.e. the equality ( iv ) : @xmath123 it is important to note that ( 9 ) assumes that @xmath124 .",
    "the numerical agreement of the two sides of ( 9 ) and the empirical agreement of the associated mass relation discussed in section 1 depend on the empirical value of the mass ratio @xmath113 , on having set the relative coupling strength @xmath125 , and on @xmath126 .",
    "the top - quark mass is the most accurately measured quark mass .",
    "it is the measured values of the @xmath127-boson and top - quark masses that make this ( iv ) relation something that is not understood .",
    "if the measured value of @xmath113 were different , ( iv ) would not hold .",
    "if @xmath102 is not set equal to @xmath128 , ( iv ) would not hold .",
    "therefore , relations ( i ) thru ( iii ) lead to the possibility of ( iv ) and its equivalent realizations holding for the current values of @xmath129 and @xmath130 with their present precisions [ 5 ] .",
    "it is not obvious whether ( iv ) is an exact or approximate relation and , unfortunately , the empirical masses will not be better known for some time .",
    "the equality ( iv ) is equivalent to @xmath131 .",
    "thus , ( iv ) is also equivalent to the velocity formula @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the velocity of the w - boson in the t - rest frame , so by this cubic equation @xmath134 without input of a specific value for @xmath135 .",
    "other @xmath136 quark decay modes are predicted by the standard model and the observed w - boson velocity must vary with different flavor @xmath136 quark mass values , so @xmath134 is presumably modified by higher order corrections depending on the @xmath136 quark mass . in the context of these four analytic relations ,",
    "we think that the relation of @xmath133 and @xmath137 is a very important , fundamental open issue that has become manifest by this equivalent realization of ( iv ) . to empirically investigate ( iv ) , a measurement of @xmath133 at a @xmath138 collider near the @xmath139-threshold might eventually be better than using the empirical mass ratio @xmath140 .",
    "[ in the @xmath141 limit , the formula @xmath142 transforms this cubic equation into the mass relation listed in sec . 1 and inversely ;",
    "in this formula the speed of light has not been set equal to 1 .",

    "unfortunately , model - dependent interpretations and assumptions are needed to relate the above analytic realizations to the observed @xmath149 production [ 2 ] . experimental tests and measurements at the tevatron [ 2 ] and lhc [ 3 ] should be able to clarify situation , for instance by excluding simple phenomenological possibilities . here in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) we discuss two simple models :    \\(1 ) as the simplest assumption , the top - quarks @xmath38 described by the sm weak decay amplitude and those @xmath150 described by the ( + ) weak decay amplitude are presumed identical except for their differing chiral weak - moments . since ( i ) nothing sufficiently fundamental appears to forbid that the observed top is more than one top - like object and since ( ii ) the explanation of the first numerical puzzle ( 9 ) might be dynamical , it is important to perform simple tests so as to empirically constrain such a possibility from @xmath149 hadroproduction . in regard to the model",
