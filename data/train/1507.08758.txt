    "thin sheets are omnipresent in nature , technology and everyday life , appearing at virtually all length scales . being much thinner in one than in the other two dimensions , they can develop an unparalleled , rich variety of deformation modes when subjected to external forces , spatial constraints , or intrinsic growth .",
    "they buckle , wrinkle , fold , and crumple .",
    "numerical simulations are an often - indispensable approach for studying the complex interplay of these modes .",
    "the folding and crumpling of a piece of paper @xcite and metal sheets wrinkling and crumpling in vehicle collisions @xcite are two out of many examples . for many such problems , the finite element method ( fem ) has shown to be amongst the most efficient and flexible tools , especially in cases with strong material nonlinearity , complex geometry , or anisotropy .",
    "even though the kirchhoff  love theory @xcite provides a simple kinematic description , numerically sound finite element implementations of thin sheets have turned out to be difficult and cumbersome in the past .",
    "these problems can be successfully overcome since the subdivision surface paradigm was introduced to the fem @xcite .",
    "large deformations of soft thin tissue such as insect wings , plant leaves , cell membranes , or flowers are often induced by growth ( or shrinkage ) @xcite , inevitably leading to the development of residual stress @xcite . in this paper , we present an extension of the kirchhoff  love theory to allow for anisotropic in - plane growth , which we implement with loop subdivision shape functions .",
    "the combination of these two concepts grants access to a very straightforward and highly efficient , yet powerful and flexible numerical tool for the simulation of nonlinear thin sheet mechanics .",
    "our approach accounts for the change of reference curvature when the surface grows , generalizing recently developed tethered mass - spring models @xcite .",
    "the next section summarizes the mentioned extension .",
    "it is followed in the subsequent sections by a series of thin sheet problems that we solve using the developed fem implementation .",
    "special attention is paid to the formation of self - similar wrinkles along a plastically stretched free edge as well as on the scaling of single - wavelength wrinkles of growing cylinders similar to flowers .",

    "the feature causing wrinkle cascades is the presence of a non - constant geometric length scale defined by @xmath83 @xcite .",

    "moreover , the data collapse of all employed growth profiles on a single line indicates that the scaling is universal in this respect . for this numerical study , we used @xmath114 in cylindrical coordinates @xmath115 with various growth profiles proportional to eqs .",

    "many numerical simulations of thin sheets getting folded and crumpled inside of shrinking hollow spheres have been carried out recently @xcite .",
    "an important result is that the high bulk stiffness of crumpled sheets is due to a network of vertices and lines carrying large mean curvature and bending energy @xcite .",

    "simulating the plastic growth of thin sheets can be numerically demanding . the finite element method ,",
    "being perhaps the best - suited technique for anisotropies , lacked an expedient @xmath39-continuous discretization , which is indispensable from a theoretical viewpoint , until subdivision surfaces were ported to it .",

    "requiring no rotational variables , a thin sheet representation of this kind is remarkably simple to implement and superior to traditional approaches in terms of computational costs .",
    "a series of example simulations were carried out to demonstrate these strengths . in particular , we have quantified the self - similarity and scaling of wrinkles along plastically stretched free edges of thin sheets , and found that the problem of a growing confined sheet is equivalent to the narrowing confinement of a static sheet .",
