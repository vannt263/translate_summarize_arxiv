    "symbiotic stars , believed to be a binary system of a giant and a hot white dwarf , are important objects for studying mass loss processes occurring in the late stage of stellar evolution ( e.g. kenyon 1986 ) . a thick neutral hydrogen region formed around the giant component as a result of the mass loss is illuminated by strong uv radiation originating from the hot white dwarf component .",
    "schmid ( 1989 ) identified the broad emission features around 6825   and 7088   found in more than half of the symbiotic stars by suggesting that they are formed via raman scattering of the resonance doublet o  vi  1032 , 1038 by atomic hydrogen .",
    "simultaneous observations in the far uv regions and many spectropolarimetric observations strongly support this identification ( e.g. birriel , espey & schulte - ladbeck 1998 , 2000 , schmid & schild 1994 , harries & howarth 1996 ) .",
    "raman scattering also appears to operate in the formation of h@xmath6 wings that have been observed in most symbiotic stars and in a number of young planetary nebulae ( nussbaumer , schmid & vogel 1989 , lee 2000 , lee & hyung 2000 , arrieta & torres - peimbert 2003 ) .",
    "the h@xmath6 profiles in the far wing regions are well fitted by @xmath13 , which delineates approximately the raman scattering cross section , where @xmath14 is the line centre wavelength of h@xmath6 .",
    "he  ii @xmath15 emission lines arising from states with even principal quantum numbers have wavelengths only a little bit shorter than those of the h  i lyman series lines .",
    "these he  ii emission lines can be raman scattered to form broad features blueward of the balmer series lines .",
    "we expect that the strongest raman scattered he  ii feature is formed at around 6545   blueward of h@xmath6 , which is formed through raman scattering of he  ii  @xmath1  1025 .",
    "this feature was found in the spectra of the symbiotic stars rr  tel , he 2 - 106 and v1016  cyg ( lee , kang & byun 2001 , lee et al .",
    "another broad feature is formed at around 4850  , which is the raman scattered feature of he  ii  @xmath1  972 .",
    "this feature was reported in spectra of the symbiotic stars rr tel ( van groningen 1993 ) and v1016  cyg ( birriel 2003 ) .",
    "it is quite notable that the young planetary nebula ngc  7027 also exhibits this 4850 broad feature ( pquignot et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "raman scattered he  ii lines can be used as a powerful diagnostic of the mass loss processes in symbiotic stars , because the mass loss rate can be calculated by inferring the optical depth structures and the covering factor of the scattering region with respect to the uv emission region around the white dwarf .",
    "however , the flux of a raman scattered he  ii feature is mainly determined by the product of the optical depth and the covering factor , which is a big barrier for the exact estimate of the mass loss rate .    in the previous theoretical study by jung & lee ( 2004 , hereafter jl04 ) , they showed that the raman scattered he  ii  @xmath1  6545 should exhibit a redward centre shift by a significant amount depending on the h  i column density of the scattering region around the giant in the absence of the relative motion between the scattering region and the emission region , which will lift the degeneracy of the optical depth and the covering factor .",
    "however , raman scattered he  ii  6545 is usually blended with the forbidden line [ n  ii ]  @xmath1  6548 , making it very hard to determine the exact peak location .",
    "this difficulty may be avoided when we use the raman scattered he  ii  4850 , which should be much weaker than the 6545 feature but be much easier to locate the peak wavelength .",
    "uv radiation around ly@xmath2 may have four scattering channels depending on the final state of the scattering atom , which can be one of @xmath16 and @xmath9 . when scattering occurs into either @xmath17 or @xmath9 level",
    ", energy conservation leads to the wavelength of the scattered radiation @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are line centre wavelengths for he  ii  @xmath1  972 and ly@xmath0 . therefore , in order to simulate the raman scattered he  ii lines accurately , it is necessary to compute the branching ratios into @xmath17 and @xmath9 states .",
    "this calculation will also be useful for the future study of raman scattered lines formed blueward of paschen series lines .    in this paper , we present an optical spectrum around h@xmath0 of the symbiotic star v1016  cygni obtained with the 1.8  m bohyunsan telescope and our monte carlo calculations of raman scattering around ly@xmath2 , in order to determine the neutral hydrogen column density of the scattering region around the giant component .",
    "we observed v1016  cyg on the night of 2003 december 16 with the bohyunsan optical echelle spectrograph equipped with a 2k@xmath214k e2v ccd installed on the 1.8  m telescope at mt .",
    "we used the 200  @xmath22 optical fiber that yields the spectroscopic resolution @xmath23 and the exposure time was 3000  s. the data have been reduced following standard procedures using the iraf packages . in fig .  1",

    "the solid line shows the observed spectrum , and in the inset we enhanced the part exhibiting the raman scattered he  ii  @xmath1  4850 feature . in this figure ,",
    "the vertical axis is shown in an arbitrary unit , which is sufficient for the purpose of this work .",
    "we measure the relative shift from the emission lines he  ii  @xmath1  4861 and h@xmath0 , where these emission lines are assumed to be isotropic in their emission region .",
    "this assumption may not be true in the accuracy required in this work . in the case of o  vi  @xmath1  1032 , 1038 doublet",
    ", it is known that their profiles and those of their raman scattered 6825 , 7088 features differ quite significantly ( schmid et al .",
    "the o  vi doublet lines are strong resonance lines that are subject to various radiative transfer effects , whereas optical he  ii recombination lines are expected to be relatively free from such effects .",
    "this may be checked by monitoring the variations as a function of the orbital phases . in this work ,",
    "we take the he  ii  @xmath1  4861 and h@xmath0 as the local reference of velocity and measure the line centre shift of the raman scattered he  ii  @xmath1  4850 .    in fig .  1 , we applied single gaussian fits to both he  ii  @xmath1  4861 and h@xmath0 to locate their peak positions .",

    ", we show the branching ratios @xmath76 for raman scattering into the @xmath7 level and the @xmath68 levels by a solid line and a dashed line , respectively .",
    "it is quite notable that the branching ratio into the level @xmath7 is about 3 times larger than the sum of the branching ratios into @xmath17 and @xmath9 near he  ii  @xmath1  972 .",
    "raman scattering into levels @xmath17 and @xmath9 will leave a broad feature at @xmath77 blueward of pa@xmath6 . according to this calculation ,",
    "it is expected that the @xmath77 feature will be constituted by a smaller number of photons by a factor of 1/3 than those in the raman scattered he  ii  @xmath1  4850 . at around @xmath78",
    "the total cross section is dominated by the scattering channel into the levels @xmath79 , for which , however , the scattering cross section is very small . near the line center of ly@xmath0",
    "the branching ratio for the levels @xmath79 becomes negligibly small due to the decrease of the phase space volume and becomes zero redward of ly@xmath0 , which is forbidden by energy conservation .",
    "the same monte carlo code used in the previous study by jl04 is slightly modified with an addition of subroutines for those scattering channels into @xmath17 and @xmath9 levels .",
    "the code incorporates the channel for rayleigh scattering as well as the two channels for raman scattering .",
    "therefore , we followed faithfully paths of he  ii photons suffering several rayleigh scatterings followed by a raman scattering in the h  i region .",
    "however , no dust effect is considered in the current work .    as in jl04 , considering the fact that he  ii  6560 , he  ii  4686 emission lines are well fitted by a single gaussian @xmath80,\\ ] ] with the velocity width @xmath81 .",
    "we use the same single gaussian for the incident radiation .",
    "since we are only concerned with the exact location of the central peak , we do not require the exact equivalent width of the he  ii  @xmath1  972 line and set it to be @xmath82 .",
    "when the scattering region is optically thin , the strength of the raman scattered feature is mainly determined by the product of the incident radiation flux and the scattering cross section .",
    "the he  ii  @xmath1  972 incident line radiation has a profile that is symmetric with respect to its line center , whereas the scattering cross section is highly inclined toward the line center of ly@xmath2 , which is located redward of he  ii  972 .",
    "this induces a redward shift of the peak in the raman scattered he  ii  @xmath1  4850 , as is explained for the raman scattered he  ii  @xmath1  6545 in jl04 .",
    "we illustrate this situation in fig .  4 , where the dotted line shows the raman scattering cross section into the level @xmath7 relevant to the formation of the 4850 feature .",
    "in this figure , the dashed line shows the sum of the raman scattering cross sections into the levels @xmath17 and @xmath9 , which is slightly larger than the quantity represented by the dotted line in this region .",
    "due to the multiple scattering effect that is important for a very optically thick scattering region , the peak shift will decrease as @xmath83 increases , and therefore a monte carlo technique is useful to obtain a reliable quantitative relation .        in fig .  5",
    ", we show typical raman scattered he  ii features formed in the blue region of h@xmath6 , h@xmath0 and pa@xmath6 , where we set @xmath84 .",
    "the formation of the 6545 feature was studied intensively by jl04 , and here it was reproduced for comparisons with those obtained from raman scattering of uv radiation around ly@xmath2 .",
    "the vertical axis shows the number of photons obtained from the monte carlo simulations for @xmath85 continuum photons per wavelength interval of @xmath86 in the uv rest frame around ly@xmath2 .",
    "we normalize the horizontal scale by the velocity @xmath87 from the line centres of raman scattering , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively . with this normalization",
    ", the flux density at @xmath90 in the raman scattered features is diluted by the factor @xmath91 .",
    "far from the line centres of balmer lines and pa@xmath6 , the rayleigh and raman scattering optical depth is quite small , and the raman wings exhibit profiles that are proportional to the total scattering cross section multiplied by the corresponding branching ratio .",
    "it is notable that the sum of the branching ratios for levels @xmath17 and @xmath9 is smaller by a factor 1/3 than the branching ratio for level @xmath7 , and therefore our simulations show that the raman scattered feature blueward of pa@xmath6 is weaker by the similar factor than the feature blueward of h@xmath0 .    near the line centres of balmer lines and pa@xmath6 ,",
    "the total scattering optical depth is quite large and the raman conversion efficiency no longer increases toward the line center . instead",
    ", almost all incident ly@xmath2 photons may be singly scattered at the surface of the scattering region by a rayleigh or raman process , or may suffer a few rayleigh scatterings followed by raman scattering or final rayleigh scattering before escape , which leads to nearly constant raman conversion efficiencies into around h@xmath0 and pa@xmath6 .",
    "more quantitatively , according to our monte carlo results , about 36 percent of incident photons very near ly@xmath2 line center are converted and redistributed around h@xmath0 and 13 percent of them are redistributed around pa@xmath6 .",
    "it is also quite notable that the raman feature blueward of pa@xmath6 appears 4 times further away from the centre of pa@xmath6 than the 4850 feature is away from the h@xmath0 centre .",
    "this is attributed to the difference in the ratio @xmath92 of the wavelengths of the raman scattered radiation and incident uv radiation .    from this figure",
    ", we infer that the wings around h@xmath0 and pa@xmath6 are very weak compared with those around h@xmath6 , unless the continuum around ly@xmath2 is unrealistically stronger than that around ly@xmath0 .",
    "the relative strengths of h@xmath6 and h@xmath0 wings may be useful in distinguishing those wings that are formed from other mechanisms including thomson scattering .      in fig .",
    "6 we show h@xmath0 wings and the raman scattered he  ii  @xmath1  4850 feature for 4 values of @xmath83 .",
    "the extent of h@xmath0 wings increases as @xmath83 increases and the wing profile is approximately by @xmath93 .",
    "a saturation behaviour is seen near the line center of h@xmath0 at which the raman scattering optical depth becomes larger than unity .",
    "the strength of the raman scattered he  ii  @xmath1  4850 also increases as @xmath83 .    in fig .  7 , in order to illustrate the centre shift phenomenon clearly",
    ", we overplot profiles of the raman scattered he  ii  @xmath1  4850 obtained for various @xmath83 as we increase @xmath83 starting from @xmath94 by a step of @xmath95 . here , we use the same incident radiation as in fig .",
    "because the strength of the 4850 feature increases as @xmath83 , stronger profiles correspond to higher @xmath83 .",
    "it is immediately seen in this figure that the amount of centre shift decreases as @xmath83 .    in fig .",
    "8 , we show the centre shift of he  ii  @xmath1  4850 feature as a function of @xmath83 , treating the scattering region as a plane - parallel slab characterized by a single column density .",
    "as is emphasized earlier , we assume that the scattering region is static with respect to the emission region and measure the relative shift from the he  ii  @xmath1  4861 .",
    "there exist fluctuations in the result shown in fig .  8 , which is indicative of the statistical nature of the monte carlo calculation .",
    "we provide a simple fit to our data , which is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the h  i column density in units of @xmath98 .",

    "is obtained when @xmath101 .",
    "it is particularly notable that the slope of the centre shift as a function of @xmath83 is small for high column densities , so that the accurate determination of @xmath83 may be significantly affected by the relative motion between the he  ii emission region and the neutral scattering region .      assuming a spherical stellar wind from the giant component in v1016  cyg",

    "therefore , the contributions to the centre shift from these sightlines will be smaller than that from the sightline for the strmgren boundary . in order to account for the observed redward shift",
    ", we have to lower the column density , which will lead to a lower mass loss rate .",
    "however , this result should be taken with much care , noting that the estimate of @xmath83 is highly sensitive to the kinematics between the emission region and the neutral scattering region .",
    "the inaccuracy of the estimation of @xmath83 can be attributed to a number of assumptions adopted in this work .",
    "the first assumption is that the scattering region is static with respect to the emission region .",
    "it is very plausible that the neutral region around the giant component takes the form of the slow stellar wind with a typical velocity of @xmath126 .",
    "the amount of center shift @xmath100 in the raman scattered he  ii  @xmath1  4850 may also be obtained from the receding velocity @xmath127 of the scattering region with respect to the emission region .",
    "this velocity scale is smaller than the slow stellar wind velocity , and hence our conclusion may be significantly affected .",
    "this is much more serious in the case of rr  tel , for which a smaller wavelength shift is concerned .",
    "however , it is also expected that the neutral region possesses both receding and approaching motions that will compensate the kinematic effect to some degree",
    ". a more refined analysis will be possible if we can secure other raman features including he  ii  @xmath1  4340 formed blueward of h@xmath2 , because the amounts of the centre shifts will differ if the effect is due to atomic physics .",
    "currently , it is not feasible to determine the center location of this feature in our spectra .",
    "spectra with longer exposures will be useful in establishing a consistent model .",
    "the assumption that the scattering region is characterized by a single column density may not be valid .",
    "a more realistic picture would be a system consisting of spherical shells with density decreasing as @xmath128 , where @xmath112 is the distance from the centre of the giant .",
    "however , the strmgren boundary due to the strong uv radiation from the white dwarf region complicates this simple picture .",
    "therefore , a more realistic model should be obtained by combining photoionization calculations that should also yield correct emission line ratios ( e.g. mrset & nussbaumer 1994 ) .",
    "the measurement of the centre shift provides an upper limit of the mass loss rate with the assumption that the scattering region is static with respect to the he  ii emission region . on the other hand ,",

    "( 2003 ) provided a rough estimate of the lower bound @xmath129 for the mass loss rate by equating @xmath83 of the sightline for the strmgren boundary with the column density corresponding to the unit raman optical depth .",
    "we tentatively conclude that the true mass loss rate may be found between the lower and upper bounds found by jl04 and the current work .",
    "when van groningen ( 1993 ) reported the discovery of the raman scattered he  ii  @xmath1  4850 feature in his spectrum of the symbiotic nova rr  tel , he also noted that it exhibits a similar redward centre shift by an amount @xmath130 in the parent velocity scale .",
    "he attributed this centre shift to a relatively receding motion between the emission region and the scattering region .",
    "he adopted the atomic data different from ours , where the line center of he  ii  @xmath1  972 appears at 972.09   in his analysis .    if we interpret his result using the atomic data adopted in this paper , the redward centre shift of the raman scattered he  ii  @xmath1  4850 in rr  tel amounts to @xmath131 , a significantly smaller than the value @xmath132 he quoted .",
    "if the scattering region in rr  tel is static with respect to the he  ii emission region , this redward shift indicates the h  i column density @xmath133 , which is considerably higher than that in v1016  cyg .",
    "this example shows that the analysis of raman scattered features requires extremely accurate atomic data and that raman features can be a very sensitive probe of the density structure around the giant component in symbiotic stars .",

    "we also thank the referee , hans martin schmid , who provided helpful comments that improved the presentation of this paper .",
