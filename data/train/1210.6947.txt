    "modern cosmological observations , like galaxies surveys ( sdss , 2df ) , galaxy rotation curves , the bullet cluster observation , studies of clusters of galaxies , surveys of supernovae ia , the cosmic microwave background radiation , and the primordial nucleosynthesis establish that the universe behaves as dominated by dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy .",
    "however , the direct evidence for the existence of these invisible components remains lacking .",
    "several theories that would modify our understanding of gravity have been proposed in order to explain the large scale structure formation in the universe and the galactic dynamics .    during the last decades",
    "there have been several proposals to explain dm , for example : massive compact halo objects ( machos ) , weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "other models propose that there is no dark matter and use general relativity with an appropriate equation of state . or we can use scalar fields , minimally or non minimally coupled to the geometry .",
    "in this work we are mainly concern with the study of dark matter ( dm ) and its influence on the rotation curves of spiral galaxies .",
    "scalar fields are the most natural candidates to model dark matter models .",
    "our dm model is based on using a scalar field ( sf ) that is coupled non - minimally with the ricci scalar in the lagrangian that gives einstein field equations .    on galactic scales",
    "we can test dark matter models using observed rotation curves .",
    "nowadays we have lots of compiled samples of galaxy data .",
    "the best type of galaxies to test dark matter model is the low surface brightness type of galaxies . in this work",
    "we test our dark matter model using a sample of low and high surface brightness galaxies .",
    "we organize our work in the following form : in the next section we present the general theory of a typical scalar - tensor theory ( stt ) , i. e. , a theory that generalizes einstein s general relativity by including the contribution of a scalar field that couples non - minimally to the metric .",
    "next we present our results for the estimation of the parameters of the scalar field dark matter model . finally , our conclusions are given in the last section .",
    "we start with the lagrangian of a general scalar - tensor theory @xmath0 + { \\cal l}_m(g_{\\mu\\nu } ) \\ ; .\\ ] ] here @xmath1 is the metric , @xmath2 is the matter lagrangian and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are arbitrary functions of the scalar field .",
    "the fact that we have a potential term @xmath4 tells us that we are dealing with a massive scalar field . also , the first term in the brackets , @xmath5 , is the one that gives the name of non - minimally coupled scalar field .    when we make the variations of the action , @xmath6 , with respect to the metric and the scalar field we obtain the einstein field equations @xcite @xmath7   , \\label{eq : einsteineqs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the metric @xmath1 and for the massive sf @xmath8 we have @xmath9 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath10 .",
    "here @xmath11 is the energy - momentum tensor with trace @xmath12 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are in general arbitrary functions that govern kinetic and potential contribution of the sf .",
    "the potential contribution , @xmath4 , provides mass to the sf , denoted here by @xmath13 .",
    "to study the rotation curves of galaxies we need to consider the influence of sf in the limit of a static stt , and then we need to describe the theory in its newtonian approximation , that is , where gravity and the sf are weak ( and time independent ) and velocities of dark matter particles are non - relativistic . we expect to have small deviations of the sf around the background field , defined here as @xmath14 and can be understood as the scalar field beyond all matter .",
    "accordingly we assume that the sf oscillates around the constant background field @xmath15 and @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the minkowski metric . then , newtonian approximation gives @xcite @xmath18 we have set @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in the above expansion",
    "we have set the cosmological constant term equal to zero , since on small galactic scales its influence should be negligible .",
    "note that equation ( [ pares_eq_h00 ] ) can be cast as a poisson equation for @xmath21 , @xmath22 and the new newtonian potential is given by @xmath23 . above equation",
    "together with @xmath24 form a poisson - helmholtz equation and gives @xmath25 which represents the newtonian limit of the stt with arbitrary potential @xmath4 and function @xmath3 that where taylor expanded around @xmath26 .",
    "the resulting equations are then distinguished by the constants @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath30 is planck s constant .",
    "the next step is to find solutions for this new newtonian potential given a density profile , that is , to find the so  called potential ",
    "density pairs .",
    "general solutions to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : psi ] ) and ( [ eq : phibar ] ) can be found in terms of the corresponding green functions , and the new newtonian potential is @xcite @xmath31 the first term of eq .",
    "( [ pares_eq_gralpsin ] ) , is the contribution of the usual newtonian gravitation ( without sf ) , while information about the sf is contained in the second term , that is , arising from the influence function determined by the modified helmholtz green function , where the coupling @xmath32 ( @xmath28 ) enters as part of a source factor .",
    "the potential of a single particle of mass @xmath33 can be easily obtained from ( [ pares_eq_gralpsin ] ) and is given by @xmath34 for local scales , @xmath35 , deviations from the newtonian theory are exponentially suppressed , and for @xmath36 the newtonian constant diminishes ( augments ) to @xmath37 for positive ( negative ) @xmath28 .",
    "this means that equation ( [ eq : pointmasspotential ] ) fulfills all local tests of the newtonian dynamics , and it is only constrained by experiments or tests on scales larger than or of the order of @xmath38 , which in our case is of the order of galactic scales .",
    "in contrast , the potential in the form of equation @xmath39 , with the gravitational constant defined as usual , does not fulfills the local tests of the newtonian dynamics @xcite .",
    "the solutions for a spherically symmetric distribution of mass is as follows : the poisson s green function can be expanded in terms of the spherical harmonics , @xmath40 , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the smaller of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the larger of @xmath43 and @xmath44 and it allows us that the standard gravitational potential due to a distribution of mass @xmath46 , without considering the boundary condition , can be written as @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) are the internal ( external ) multipole expansion of @xmath50 , @xmath51    here , the coefficients of the expansions @xmath48 and @xmath49 , known as internal and external multipoles , respectively , are given by @xmath52    the integrals are done in a region @xmath53 where @xmath54 for the internal multipoles and in a region @xmath53 where @xmath55 for the external multipoles .",
