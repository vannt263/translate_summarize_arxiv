    "because of the great variety of phenomena present in the motion of vehicles along highways or in urban roads , traffic dynamics has attracted the attention of a large number of researchers in the last decades . traditionally , three different approaches can be used to study traffic flow problems , namely : a purely microscopic approach in which the acceleration of a driver - vehicle unit is determined by other vehicles moving in traffic flow , a macroscopic approach which describes the collective motion of the vehicles as the one - dimensional compressible flow of a fluid , and a mesoscopic approach which specifies the individual behavior of the vehicles by means of probability distribution functions .",
    "a reading of relevant literature shows that since 1955 , when lighthill and whitham  @xcite proposed the first continuum model to describe traffic flow , much progress has been made in the development of macroscopic ( fluid - type ) models on the one hand , and of microsocopic ( follow - the - leader ) models on the other hand .",
    "the first mesoscopic ( or gas - kinetic ) traffic flow model just appeared in 1960 , when prigogine and andrews  @xcite wrote a boltzmann - like equation to describe the time evolution of a one - vehicle distribution function in a phase - space where the position and the velocity of the vehicles plays a role . until the 1990s , mesoscopic traffic models do not get much attention from scientists due to their lack of ability to describe traffic operations outside of the free - flow regime .",
    "additionally , compared to macroscopic traffic flow models , gas - kinetic traffic models have a large number of independent variables that increase the computational complexity . however , in the last decade , the scientific community s interest by mesoscopic traffic models resurrected with the publication of some works that apply these models to derive macroscopic traffic models ( see , for example , the papers of helbing  @xcite , hoogendoorn and bovy  @xcite , wagner et al .",
    "macroscopic equations for relevant traffic variables can be derived from a boltzamnn - like traffic equation by averaging over the instantaneous velocity of the vehicles .",
    "this is a well - known procedure in the kinetic theory , nevertheless its application leads to a closure problem , i.e. , there are some quantities which must be evaluated with constitutive relations in order to obtain a system of closed equations .",
    "the analogy with well - established methods of the kinetic theory of gases - such as the chapman - enskog method  @xcite or the method of moments of grad  @xcite - gives us a clue to proceed , provided we have at least a local equilibrium distribution function .    by assuming that motorists drive aggressively  @xcite we apply both the chapman - enskog method and the method of moments of grad to construct a second - order continuum traffic model which is similar to the navier - stokes model for viscous fluids .",
    "in the chapman - enskog method , constitutive relations are constructed at sucessive levels of approximation by expanding the distribution function in power of the mean free path , while in grad s moment method the distribution function is approximated by an expansion in orthonormal polynomials where the coefficients are related to the moments of the distribution function .",
    "the dependence of our constitutive relation for the traffic pressure with the velocity gradient in non - equilibrium situations , drive us to define a traffic viscosity coefficient which , in our case , depends on the traffic state through the density and the mean velocity of the vehicles . as several second - order continuum traffic models , there exists in our navier - stokes - like traffic model a characteristic speed that is greater than the average flow velocity .",
    "the existence of this faster characteristic speed means that the motion of the vehicles will be influenced by the traffic conditions behind them .",
    "this seems to be a drawback of our second - order model since one fundamental principle of traffic flow is that vehicles are anisotropic and respond only to frontal stimuli .",
    "however , as pointed out by helbing and johansson  @xcite and j. yi et al .",
    "@xcite , this faster characteristic speed does not represent a theoretical inconsistency to our navier - stokes traffic model since it is related to an eigenmode that decays quickly and , therefore , it can not emerge by itself .",
    "besides , we check the anisotropic behavior of our second - order continuum traffic model by performing the simulations of a traffic situation where a discontinuity is present , namely : the removal of a blockade scenario .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we present our kinetic traffic model for aggressive drivers . in section 3",
    "we construct a second - order continuum traffic model - which is similar to the navier - stokes equations for viscous fluids - by applying both the chapman - enskog method and the method of moments of grad . in section 4",
    "we present the results of our numerical simulation .",
    "finally , we give in section 5 a summary .",
    "in a mesoscopic description the state of a vehicle at a given instant of time is represented by points in phase space , where the coordinates are the position @xmath0 and the velocity @xmath1 of the vehicle .",
    "thus , in analogy with the kinetic theory of gases , an one - vehicle distribution function @xmath2 can be defined in such a way that @xmath3 gives at time @xmath4 the number of vehicles in the road interval between @xmath0 and @xmath5 and in the velocity interval between @xmath1 and @xmath6 . for an uni - directional single - lane road without entrances and exits",
    ", the one - vehicle distribution function satisfies the kinetic traffic equation  @xcite @xmath7 where the interaction term @xmath8 describes the decelaration processes due to slower vehicles which can can not be immediately overtaken .",
    "the first part of the interaction term corresponds to situations where a vehicle with velocity @xmath9 must decelerate to velocity @xmath1 causing an increase of the one - vehicle distribution function , while the second one describes the decrease of the one - vehicle distribution function due to situations in which vehicles with velocity @xmath1 must decelerate to even slower velocity @xmath9 .",
    "the  derivation of the interaction term is based on the following hypotheses : ( i ) vehicles are regarded as point - like objects , ( ii ) the slowing down process has the probability @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the probability of passing , ( iii ) the velocity of the slow vehicle is not affected by interactions or by being passed , ( iv ) there is no braking time , ( v ) only two - vehicle interactions are considered and ( vi ) vehicular chaos is assumed , in such way that the two - vehicle distribution function can be factorized .",
    "the individual acceleration term appearing on the left - hand side of the kinetic traffic equation can be modeled by assuming that vehicles moving with velocity @xmath1 accelerate exponentially to their desired velocity @xmath12 with a relaxation time @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath14 in fact , the desired velocity of the vehicles is determined by the average balance among several traffic parameters like legal traffic regulations , weather conditions , road conditions and drivers personality , i.e. , it is a phenomenological function . despite of the variety of traffic parameters that determines the desired velocity of the vehicles",
    ", we shall consider in this work the simple relation  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a positive parameter that depends on traffic conditions along the road",
    ". on driver s level , relation ( 4 ) indicates that the desired velocity of the vehicles increases as their velocity increases , which is a common feature of aggressive drivers . by assuming that the aggressiveness parameter @xmath17 depends on position and time only through the vehicular density",
    ", we shall consider the following constitutive relation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the jam ( or maximum ) density , @xmath20 is the critical vehicle density ( i.e. the density value which maximizes the aggressiveness parameter ) and @xmath21 is the maximal value for drivers aggressiveness . expression ( 5 ) tell us that : ( i ) when traffic is very dilute the aggressiveness parameter must tend to one , since in this limit vehicles move along the highway at its desired speed , ( ii ) as the vehicle density increases , the velocity of the vehicles starts to decrease , and drivers try to compensate this situation by increasing their aggressiveness , ( iii ) when the density exceeds its critical value , it becomes increasingly difficult for the vehicles to move at its desired speed and , in this case , the drivers have no choice except to reduce its aggressiveness , ( iv ) when the highway is fully occupied , the vehicles can no longer move and the aggressiveness parameter must tend to one .",
    "figure 1 shows the dependence of the aggressiveness parameter on the vehicular density for @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "lastly , it is important to mention that the constitutive relation ( 5 ) is not a unique model to the aggressiveness parameter , but just a sound one .",
    "the kinetic traffic equation ( 1 ) allows the derivation of balance equations for macroscopic traffic variables like the vehicular density @xmath24 and the average velocity @xmath25 the integration of the kinetic traffic equation over all values of the actual velocity of the vehicles yields the continuity equation @xmath26 while the traffic momentum equation @xmath27 follows through the multiplication of the kinetic traffic equation with @xmath1 and the integration over all values of the actual velocity of the vehicles . in the derivation of the traffic momentum equation",
    "we have introduced the traffic pressure @xmath28 and used relations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) . at this point",
    "it is important to emphasize that the balance equations ( 8) and ( 9 ) can only be obtained if the one - vehicle distribution function satisfies the following boundary conditions : @xmath29 based on the continuity and momentum equations , we can construct a second - order continuum traffic model by specifying the traffic pressure in terms of the vehicular density , the average velocity and their spatial gradients .",
    "since there are a variety of possible constitutive relations which can be borrowed from fluid dynamics , we shall restrict ourselves here to the derivation of a constitutive relation for the traffic pressure which is similar to the usual navier - stokes relation for ordinary viscous fluids , i.e. , a constitutive relation written in terms of the density , the average velocity and their first - order spatial gradients .",
    "one can achieve this goal by applying , for example , the chapman - enskog method or the method of moments of grad , as they are developed in the kinetic theory of gases . in the chapman - enskog method ,",
    "constitutive relations are constructed at sucessive levels of approximation by expanding the distribution function in power of the mean free path , while in grad s moment method the gas - kinetic equation is replaced by a set of balance equations for the moments of the distribution function . to close this set of equations ,",
    "the distribution function is approximated by an expansion in orthonormal polynomials , where the coefficients are related to the moments of the distribution function .",
    "then , by applying an iteration procedure in the resulting system of field equations , it is possible to derive first - order constitutive relations . here , we shall apply both methods to derive a first - order constitutive relation for the traffic pressure which is similar to the navier - stokes relation for viscous fluids .",
    "the basic idea of the chapman - enskog method is to expand the distribution function into a power series in the rarefaction parameter @xmath30 as @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents successive approximations to the distribution function . in traffic flow problems ,",
    "the rarefaction parameter is a dimensionless number defined as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the road length and @xmath35 denotes the mean distance traveled by a vehicle between successive interactions .",
    "based on the value of the rarefaction paramater , it is possible to identify two traffic flow regimes : ( i ) the rarefied regime , when @xmath36 , and ( ii ) the continuum regime , when @xmath37 . in the rarefied regime , the processes of acceleration and decelaration of the vehicles can be neglected and the general solution of the kinetic traffic equation in this regime reads @xmath38 otherwise , in the continuum regime , the processes of acceleration and deceleration of the vehicles can not be neglected , so that the distribution function is determined by both the individual acceleration law and the interaction term . to determine the distribution function in this limit ,",
    "it is appropriate to write the kinetic traffic equation ( 1 ) in the following dimensionless form @xmath39 where the position is given in units of the road length , the velocity is given in units of the average velocity , the time is given units of the mean flow time ( the mean time required for vehicles to traverse the road ) and the vehicular acceleration is given in units of @xmath40 .",
    "integral equations for the distribution function approximations can be easily obtained if we insert the expansion ( 12 ) into the dimensionless kinetic traffic equation ( 15 ) and equate equal power of the scale parameter .",
    "hence , we obtain @xmath41 and @xmath42 where @xmath43 by assuming that the vehicular density and the mean velocity are only determined by the zeroth - order approximation of the distribution function , the solution of the integral equation ( 16 ) with the individual acceleration law ( 3 ) leads to @xmath44 where @xmath45 expression ( 19 ) for the zeroth - order distribution function tell us that the velocity of the vehicles is gamma - distributed with a shape parameter @xmath46 and a rate parameter @xmath47 when drivers drive agressively on the highway . to gain an insight into the shape parameter ,",
    "let us calculate the velocity variance ( or velocity dispersion ) in the zeroth - order approximation , i.e. , @xmath48 from the above expression we verify that the velocity variance depends quadratically on the mean velocity , a fact which can be used to identify the inverse of the shape parameter as the prefactor of the velocity variance .",
    "the experimental data reported by shvetsov and helbing  @xcite demonstrate that the prefactor of the velocity variance is almost constant at the low - density region , otherwise it can be taken as a function of the vehicular density . in this work , we shall take this prefactor or , rather , the shape parameter as a constant whose value is greater than unity , so that our gas - kinetic - like traffic model is restricted to low densities .    in order to determine the first - order approximation to the one - vehicle distribution function we introduce expression ( 19 ) into the integral equation @xmath49 which follows from ( 17 ) by taking @xmath50 . by utilizing the constraints @xmath51 which are valid for @xmath52 we obtain @xmath53+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial c } \\biggl(f^{\\sc ( 1)}\\spc \\frac{dc}{dt}\\biggr ) = -\\rho ( 1-\\p)(c - v)f^{\\sc ( 1)}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the dot denotes the material time derivative .",
    "integration of equation ( 24 ) over all values of the actual velocity leads to the continuity equation @xmath54 besides , if we multiply equation ( 24 ) with @xmath1 and integrate over all values of the actual velocity we get @xmath55 if equations ( 25 ) and ( 26 ) are used to eliminate the material time derivatives appearing in equation  ( 24 ) we obtain @xmath56\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x } + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial c } \\biggl(f^{\\sc ( 1)}\\spc \\frac{w-1}{\\tau}\\spc c\\biggr ) + \\alpha \\bigl(\\frac{c}{v}-1\\bigr)\\frac{w-1}{\\tau}\\spc f^{\\sc    ( 1)}\\nonumber\\\\[3 mm ] = f^{\\sc ( 0)}\\alpha \\left(1-\\p\\right ) v\\spc \\bigl(\\frac{c}{v}-1\\bigr ) \\int_0^\\infty \\bigl(\\frac{\\cp}{v}-1\\bigr)^{\\!2}\\spc f^{\\prime \\sc ( 1)}d\\cp.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] based on equation ( 27 ) we shall write the first - order approximation to one - vehicle distribution function as @xmath57\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are position and time - dependent coefficients to be determined",
    ". insertion of expression ( 28 ) into constraints ( 23 ) and equation ( 27 ) leads to @xmath61 note that the dependence of the expansion coefficients with position and time comes through the parameter @xmath17 that measures the average agressiveness of drivers .",

    "@xcite by applying a simplified version of the chapman - enskog method to the reduced paveri - fontana traffic equation  @xcite . in their formalism",
    ", the collective relaxation time @xmath66 appears as a free adjustable parameter of order of the mean vehicular interaction time , and it was introduced by means of a relaxation approximation performed in the interaction term .      in grad",
    "s moment method a macroscopic description of traffic flow is based on macroscopic traffic variables like the vehicular density , the average velocity and the central moments of the distribution function @xmath67 the balance equations governing the dynamical behavior of these macroscopic traffic variables are the continuity equation ( 8) , the traffic momentum equation ( 9 ) and the balance equations @xmath68 = -\\rho\\spc ( 1-\\p)\\biggl(m_{k+1}-k\\spc \\frac{m_{k-1}}{\\rho}\\spc \\varpi\\biggr).\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] in deriving the balance equations ( 35 ) for the central moments we have multiplied the kinetic traffic equation ( 1 ) by @xmath69 , and subsequently integrated with respect to the actual velocity of the vehicles .    clearly , we can see that the balance equations ( 8) , ( 9 ) and ( 35 ) form a non - closed system of field equations for the determination of the moments @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , since the balance equation for the central moment @xmath72 contains the central moment @xmath73 which is not a priori related to the lower order moments .",

    "insertion of the position and time - dependent coefficients into the expansion of the distribution function allows us to write it in terms of the velocity polynomials and the macroscopic traffic variables .",

    "we will carry out an standard iterative procedure known in the kinetic theory of gases as the maxwellian iteration procedure .",
    "insertion of the distribution function ( 53 ) into expression ( 49 ) leads , after a simple integration , to the following constitutive relation for the third - order central moment : @xmath96 if we introduce the constitutive relation ( 54 ) into the balance equations ( 8) , ( 9 ) and ( 52 ) we obtain a system of field equations for @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath91 or , equivalently , for @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the so - called traffic pressure deviator .",

    "figures 2 and 3 show that after the removal of the blockade the vehicles at the head of the queue move downstream into the empty region with the free - flow velocity , while vehicles at the tail of the queue remain at their location . although the traffic conditions upstream are free - flow we observe from these figures that vehicles do not flow backwards into the empty region , a fact that allow us to say that our navier - stokes - like traffic model satisfies the anisotropy condition and produces numerical results which are similar to traffic operations in real - life traffic .",
    "similar results were obtained by hoogendoorn  @xcite through numerical simulations performed on the single user - class version of his macroscopic multiple user - class traffic flow model .",
    "hoogendoorn s macroscopic multiple user - class traffic model was derived from mesoscopic principles which encompass contributions of drivers acceleration towards their user - class specific desired velocity and contributions resulting from interactions between vehicles of the same and different classes .",
    "besides , the velocity variance is introduced as an additional basic field describing deviations from the average velocity within the user - classes .    0.3truecm",
    "by appling both chapman - enskog expansion and grad s moment method we constructed a second - order continuum traffic model which is very similar to the navier - stokes model for viscous fluids .",
    "the constitutive relation for the traffic pressure obtained by the method of moments of grad is identical to that one obtained by the chapman - enskog procedure , a fact that allow us to affirm that chapman - enskog expansion and grad s moment method are both physically and mathematically equivalent , at least in first - order approximation . besides , in contrast to others second - order macroscoscopic traffic models , our traffic viscosity coefficient - which depends on the traffic state through the vehicle density and the mean velocity - is not introduced in an ad hoc way , but comes into play through the derivation of a constitutive relation to the traffic pressure .",
