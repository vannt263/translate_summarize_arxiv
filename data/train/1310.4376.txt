    "a coherent version of the widely discussed charge and nano - magnet cellular automata @xcite would offer increased speed , reduced dissipation , and would perform quantum computation while interfacing smoothly with its classical counterpart . however , maintaining long time coherence is a challenge @xcite .",
    "it is appealing to use quantum dot ( qd ) spins , with coherence times of @xmath2 @xmath3s , @xcite and in particular singlet - triplet electron pairs , which are largely decoherence free @xcite . here",
    "we show how  single \" qds , each hosting a singlet - triplet qubit , can be placed in arrays to build a spin quantum cellular automaton .",
    "our proposal combines the best of two worlds  the coherence of spin pairs known from quantum technologies , and the strength and range of electrostatic couplings from charge - based classical cellular automata .",
    "a fast ( @xmath4 ns ) deterministic two - qubit gate is accomplished via non - equilibrium ( non - adiabatic ) dynamics and capacitive interactions in the course of which no electric dipole moment ever arises , thereby increasing charge coherence significantly .",
    "many double dot proposals for two - qubit gates already exist , using electrostatic interactions @xcite .",
    "their nonzero dipole moment during the gate operations , however , causes rapid charge dephasing @xcite .",
    "using more symmetric charge configurations , on the other hand , makes the gate operation slow ( @xmath5 ns ) @xcite .",
    "if charge tunneling in double qds eventually becomes incoherent due to the long time scale and strong dephasing , then a set time for the gate operation will disappear , rendering the system indeterministic . in view of the increasing speed of control electronics",
    "it is thereby worthwhile to consider non - adiabatic tunnelings that do not create dipole moments .",
    "our proposal can also be realized in a ring of four coupled qds , which is functionally equivalent to the system we study .",
    "this ring structure has already been used for charge - based qubits @xcite , but the spin dependent dynamics has not yet been explored .",
    "singlet - triplet qubits in double dots face a fundamental obstacle by seeking to exploit coherent charge tunneling for two - qubit gate operations . indeed , the very limited and short charge dephasing time ( @xmath6 1 ns ) is comparable with the charge tunneling times .",
    "for instance the 6 @xmath7 tunneling rate in ref .",
    "@xcite gives a period of @xmath8 ns for coherent oscillations . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the dominant source of dephasing in double dot systems is the interaction between the electric dipole of the two electrons with random electric field fluctuations . in double dot systems",
    "the asymmetric charge configuration @xmath9 has a large dipole moment @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the separation between the dots , which gives rise to charge decoherence .",
    "motivated by this , we present a system which benefits from an extra charge orbital that always keeps the charge distribution symmetric with zero dipole moment , resulting in much longer charge dephasing times .",
    "one can call this a singlet - triplet qubit , which couples to its environment ( and indeed any distant qubits in a scalable network with which the couplings are not sought ) through its _ quadrupole _ moment , as opposed to the dipole .",
    "in addition this extra orbital allows for symmetric charge configurations during gate operations , which enables the simultaneous implementation of identical two - qubit gates between all neighboring pairs in a row , as required for generating cluster states for measurement - based quantum computation . moreover , our quench dynamics is applicable for degenerate qubit ( i.e. singlet - triplet ) levels so that no relative phase develops between them during storage ( non - operative ) periods of the qubit .",
    "both the above features are absent in double dot singlet - triplet qubits , because of their asymmetric charge configurations and the need for an initial singlet - triplet gap for adiabatic operation at non - zero speeds .     and",

    "total spin is a good quantum number the eigenstates are singlets and triplets .",

    "we show the lowest - lying energy levels for two sizes of qd , @xmath39 nm and @xmath40 nm , as a function of the gating potential @xmath38 . throughout this work",
    "we shall use material parameters for gaas , and as the effective bohr radius for electrons in this material is @xmath41 nm , these two qd sizes correspond to @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "we see that in both cases the energy level structure is similar for small @xmath38 , consisting of a multiplet of two singlets and triplets , well separated from the next higher states .",
    "the formation of this isolated multiplet is a general feature of large qds for which @xmath44 .",
    "when this condition is satisfied the coulomb interaction dominates the kinetic energy , causing the electronic charge density to localize near the corners of the qd @xcite .",
    "we emphasise that although our model and gating scheme are rather simple , our approach does not require perfect square symmetry , or hard walls , or a perfectly flat background potential . in experiment , for example , gating will produce soft - wall confinement , but this effect , together with deviations from symmetry , and roughness in the confining potential arising from disorder , can be accounted for by renormalizing the tunneling ( see ) between the two charge configurations . the formation of these low - lying localized states is a rather robust effect .",
    "we will use the states in the lowest multiplet as our qubit space . at @xmath45",
    "the two triplet states are degenerate , and the two singlet states have an energy splitting of @xmath46 . to choose an optimum size for the qd we must balance two opposing effects . as we can see from , in larger qds",
    "the ground state multiplet in the larger qd is more isolated from higher states than for smaller qds , which will reduce leakage from the qubit space .",
    "the tradeoff from using large qds , however , is that the energy splitting @xmath47 drops rapidly with @xmath22 @xcite , making the qubit operation time longer and putting more stringent limits on the operating temperature of the device ( see sec .",

    "@xcite for the case of @xmath45 .",
    "this is a consequence of the very different dynamics displayed by the singlet and triplet states under free evolution .",

    "in contrast , if the system is initialized in the triplet state @xmath95 , its time dependence simply consists of a trivial phase , as the triplet hamiltonian does not contain tunneling terms between the triplet states .",
    "the spin of the initial state can thus be detected , or filtered , by a single charge measurement at @xmath20 or @xmath25 ; the singlet component oscillates periodically with time , while the triplet component stays frozen in position .",

    "does not evolve . applying a large gate potential",
    "thus has the effect of shutting off the oscillation of the singlet states between the vertical and horizontal configurations .",

    ", the singlet periodically cycles between its vertical and horizontal orientations as expected from our effective model .",
    "however , reapplying the gate potential freezes the time evolution of the system , which remains halted until the potential is again released .",

    "this qubit is well - defined , and is highly localized in its vertical configuration . for finite @xmath38 , the eigenvector @xmath55 has a small contribution of @xmath23 , as @xmath101 , but this can be arbitrarily suppressed by controlling @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , as shown in , in the regime of strong @xmath38 both @xmath55 and @xmath102 become almost degenerate , and so there will be no relative phase between them .",
    "an arbitrary unitary operation on a single qubit can be realized by sequential rotations around two different axes , such as @xmath31 and @xmath103 .",
    "rotations around the @xmath103-axis may be simply achieved by the energy splitting @xmath104 between @xmath55 and @xmath27 in the regime of @xmath105 where the electrons are still strongly localized in their vertical configurations ( i.e. @xmath106 ) , but @xmath107 does not vanish .",

    "one can select the appropriate @xmath38 to give the @xmath107 that will perform the desired rotation in a given time interval , during which the electrons remain in the vertical configuration .",
    "rotation around the @xmath31 axis demands switching between @xmath108 and @xmath109 . to do that a gradient of magnetic field @xmath110 is required between the vertical corners @xmath88 .",
    "there are two different proposals for generating this gradient magnetic field : ( i ) polarizing the spin of the nuclei in the bulk @xcite ; ( ii ) using permanent micro - magnets @xcite . here",
    ", we propose to use permanent micro - magnets near the the corners @xmath88 as shown in ( a ) . to perform an @xmath31 rotation , one has to push the electrons close to the micro - magnets to sense @xmath110 by applying a strong positive bias to the gates @xmath111 and @xmath112 , which may be the micro - magnets themselves .",
    "the gradient @xmath110 rotates a single electron around the @xmath103 axis and consequently switches between a singlet and a triplet state .",
    "an initial qubit state may be created by injecting a spin - up electron into corner @xmath19 and a down - spin electron into corner @xmath28 , while holding @xmath38 large enough to ensure that the electrons remain well - localized in these corners .",

    "different horizontal and vertical interactions results in different two - qubit gates which can be compensated by local rotations . ]",
    "apart from single qubit unitary operations , the more challenging two - qubit quantum gates are also essential for universal quantum computation @xcite .",
    "we consider two square qds , each containing two electrons encoding a singlet - triplet qubit as described above .",
    "interaction between the left and right qubits is mediated through the electrostatic coulomb repulsion , as shown in ( a ) , which is independent of the spin states .",
    "due to symmetry there are three independent electrostatic energies for the four possible spatial configurations of electrons in two qds ( i.e. @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 ) , where one of them can also set to be zero ( overall energy shift ) .",
    "therefore , as schematically shown in ( a ) , we can write the interaction between the two qds as @xmath118 where @xmath119 account for the electrostatic coulomb energies in the configurations @xmath120 and @xmath121 respectively while the interactions of configurations @xmath122 and @xmath123 are chosen as the offset . by treating the electrons as classical point charges localized in the corners of the square confining potential , one can estimate @xmath124 and @xmath125 as functions of the dot size @xmath22 and their distance @xmath25 ( see ( a ) ) .",
    "in fact , the leading terms in coulomb energies @xmath124 and @xmath125 are second order in @xmath126 giving @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the vacuum permittivity and @xmath129 is the dielectric constant of gaas .",
    "the hamiltonian of the whole system then becomes @xmath130 , where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are given by for the left and right qds .",

    "after time @xmath138 the evolution is again frozen by setting @xmath38 to a negative value which keeps the electrons in the horizontal configuration for an interaction time period of @xmath139 , during which the system evolves under the action of @xmath133 alone .",
    "the potential barriers are then again removed ( i.e. @xmath38 is set to zero ) for another period of @xmath138 to return the electrons to their initial positions .",
    "one can write the total evolution operator as @xmath140 over the interaction time @xmath141 , each spatial configuration determined by the spin state of electrons has its own electrostatic energy , and thus the time evolution gives different phases to every state",
    ". one may easily verify that @xmath142 for @xmath143 , this evolution realizes an entangling two - qubit gate such that its application to the state @xmath144 maximally entangles the two qubits .",

    "in our mechanism , single qubit measurement in the computational @xmath103 basis is the singlet - triplet measurement of the electron pair in the qd .",
    "this can be achieved by setting @xmath38 to zero , thereby allowing tunneling from vertical to horizontal configurations for the singlet ( triplet states are unable to tunnel from vertical to horizontal as there are no tunneling elements between these states ) .",
    "a single charge detection then fulfills the singlet - triplet measurement  @xcite , as explained in section [ filter ] .",
    "single qubit measurement in any other basis can be simply reduced to a @xmath103 measurement by applying proper local rotations .",
    "universal quantum computation can be achieved in two dimensional network of qubits , which can be prepared in a highly entangled state termed a cluster state @xcite . to prepare a cluster state",
    "we need a two - dimensional array of qubits all initially prepared in @xmath147 states .",
    "then a homogeneous action of @xmath145 gates between all neighboring qubits generates a cluster state , on which measurement - based quantum computation can be realized by local rotations and single qubit measurements @xcite .",
    "such an array of qds is shown in ( b ) .",
    "note that when electrons are frozen in their locations , the electrostatic interactions only give a global phase . in this structure when the system is released for a global gate operation , the type of the gate that acts on rows is different from the one acting on columns , unless @xmath148 .",
    "however , these gates can be locally transformed to @xmath145 gates , and thus the outcome is still a cluster state and can be used for measurement - based quantum computation .",
    "note that in an array of double dots used to realize a two - qubit gate , one has to change the charge configurations to @xmath9 , which makes the left and right neighbor qubits experience asymmetric interactions , thereby prohibiting simultaneous identical gates .",
    "in this section we estimate the parameters of the system and explore the experimental feasibility of our proposal . for qds of side - length",
    "@xmath149 nm , we have @xmath53ev . separating the qds so that @xmath150ev guarantees the validity of to very high precision , as @xmath151 .",
    "the operation time of our two - qubit gate is @xmath152 .",
    "using the above values yields an operation time of @xmath153 ns .",
    "the spacing between the qds ( @xmath25 ) corresponding to this choice of physical parameters can be calculated from , giving a value of @xmath154 m .    to determine the temperatures in which the system can operate one has to estimate the energy gap of the system . from one",
    "can see that the energy gap between the singlet and triplet subspace is @xmath155 . for the system to operate safely",
    "the temperature should be below the energy gap . using the above parameters for a square dot of size @xmath149 nm",
    "in which @xmath53ev , one can evaluate the energy gap as @xmath156 mk which is larger than the typical temperatures ( @xmath157 mk ) achievable with current dilution fridges .",
    "this clearly shows that the proposed mechanism can be realized with existing technology .",
    "a major obstacle for realizing two qubit gates through capacitive interaction in double dot systems is the very short charge dephasing time ( @xmath158 ns ) .",
    "such a short time scale is due to the interaction between the electric dipole @xmath159 of the two electrons with the random fluctuating electric field @xmath160 ( namely @xmath161 ) . to realize a two - qubit quantum gate in double dot systems one can use the electrostatic coupling between the two neighboring double dots which give different phases to singlets and triplets according to their different charge configurations . since the charge configurations of the singlets and triplets are quite similar for the @xmath162 configuration the time scale of the two qubit gate becomes too long ( for instance it is @xmath5 ns in the realization of ref .",
    "one can speed up this process significantly , even up to @xmath163 ns @xcite , by giving more offset energy to one of the dots in order to convert the singlet charge configuration to @xmath164 , leaving one of the dots empty , to make the capacitive interaction stronger .",
    "however , this produces significant charge dephasing , as singlets and triplets have different electric dipole moments ( due to the asymmetric charge configuration @xmath9 of the singlets ) and interact differently with electric field fluctuations .",
    "in contrast , in our square qd proposal the charge configuration always remains symmetric with zero electric dipole moment .",
    "hence , the leading term for charge dephasing is quadrupolar , giving a much longer charge dephasing time .",
    "the hyperfine interaction between the electrons and nuclei in the bulk is the main source of decoherence in qds . to compensate this effect",
    "we may use the recently - implemented idea of multiple - pulse echo sequence @xcite . in this technique the quantum states of the two electrons are swapped through exchange interaction regularly , allowing decoherence times of @xmath165s . as mentioned in the previous section , for dots with the size @xmath149 nm , we have @xmath53ev and fabricating the dots with a spacing of @xmath166 m gives @xmath151 .",
    "these parameters imply that the two - qubit operation time will be @xmath167 ns which allows for of the order of @xmath168 operations within the coherence time of the system . even in the absence of regular exchange of quantum states ,",
    "the hyperfine interaction between the electrons and nuclei in the bulk is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath47 @xcite , and one order of magnitude less than @xmath169 .",
    "this guarantees that it has no significant effect over the proposed fast dynamics ( @xmath6 12 ns ) although the coherence time is then limited to 1 @xmath170 @xcite and thus the number of operation reduces to @xmath171 .",
    "another major of imperfection in singlet - triplet double qd systems is due to the gate voltage fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this makes the tunneling between the two dots noisy which then results in fluctuations in spin exchange coupling which is @xmath172 ( for tunneling @xmath173 and on - site energy @xmath174 ) .",
    "as tunneling in double dot systems is directly controlled by gate voltages while the on - site energy is independently determined by the coulomb interaction , the spin exchange coupling fluctuates in time with the tunneling @xcite . in our square qd system , however , the exchange coupling @xmath175 is determined by @xmath176 .",
    "so , in the large @xmath38 limit , which we use for the single qubit gate operations , the fluctuations of the gate voltage @xmath38 appear only in the denominator and @xmath47 is independent of @xmath38 to first order .",
    "thus we expect less sensitivity to gate voltages in our scheme .",
    "so far we have assumed that @xmath38 can be instantaneously switched on and off at desired times . in reality gate voltages",
    "can not jump instantly , and so @xmath38 varies gradually .",
    "one can estimate the gradual switching error by assuming that @xmath38 is switched off ( or on ) linearly over a period of @xmath177 .",
    "for instance , in a linear switching of @xmath38 over the time period @xmath138 to @xmath178 produces an error equal to @xmath179 .",
    "in particular , for qds of size @xmath149 nm , ( i.e. @xmath180ev ) a gradual switching with duration @xmath181 ps induces less than @xmath182 error in our desired state .",
    "apart from gaas technology , one can also realize our quantum cellular automata using the silicon atom dangling bonds on hydrogen terminated silicon crystal surface @xcite .",
    "the four coupled qds located in a ring , hosting two highly interacting electrons ( fully capable for achieving our spin filtering dynamics ) have been realized experimentally @xcite .",
    "the isotopically purified silicon provides very long decoherence time ( @xmath183 exceeding 200 @xmath170 ) as the nuclear spin interaction is practically eliminated , and a charge dephasing time of @xmath184ns has been measured for charge qubits in si double qds @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the singlet and triplet states of a pair of electrons held in a square qd can be used as a rapid and deterministically - controlled qubit . introducing electrostatic interactions between neighboring qubits",
    "allows two - qubit entangling gates to be constructed , thus enabling universal quantum computation , with particular suitability to its measurement - based version . the extra charge orbital in our system enables the fundamental issue of short charge dephasing time of singlet - triple qubits in double dots to be tackled by having zero dipole moment .",
    "hence the leading interaction with the environment is quadrupolar , resulting in much longer charge coherence .",
    "the architecture was inspired by classical cellular automata implementations @xcite thereby linking them to the quantum realm and providing a path for quantum - classical integrability in computer technology .",
    "while singlet - triplet qubits have already been realized in double dots , our proposal makes a number of advances , namely : ( i ) no electric dipoles at any stage ( potentially much longer coherence ) ; ( ii ) symmetric gate operations ; ( iii ) no relative phases during the storage ; and ( iv ) non - adiabatic ( i.e. fast ) operation which could become preferable in view of the continually improving speed of control electronics ; ( v ) less sensitivity to gate voltage fluctuations .",
    "we should emphasize that as well as the single qd geometry we have presented here , our results are also applicable with minor modifications to the four - dot structure studied experimentally in ref .",
