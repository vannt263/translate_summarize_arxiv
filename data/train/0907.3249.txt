    "according to their results , the renormalized values which are the same as the bare value @xmath198 ( and @xmath199 ) are obtained when the renormalization point is chosen at @xmath200 .",
    "it is possible to translate this result to that at the other renormalization point by using their result .",

    "note that the perturbation theory leads to @xmath203 , e.g. , @xmath204 at one loop , because the free gluon propagator is not ir finite .",
    "the renormalization will be discussed in more detail in a subsequent paper @xcite .",
    "we point out that the result crucially depends on the explicit form of the non - local horizon term adopted .",

    "this fact that the horizon condition using this definition ( [ hc2 ] ) is equivalent to the kugo - ojima criterion ( [ koc ] ) has already been pointed out and it was checked to what extent the horizon condition holds in the numerical simulation in @xcite .",
    "more details on the foundation for the horizon function are given in @xcite .",
    "the resulting discrepancy comes from the neglection of the total derivative term in the _ non - local _ theory . in the case of the local theory ,",
    "the total derivative term can be neglected , since the volume integral is replaced by the surface integral over the surface @xmath212 far away from the origin by the gauss theorem : @xmath213   = & \\int_{s=\\partial v } d^{d-1 } s_\\mu(x )   [ f_\\mu(x ) ]   \\nonumber\\\\   = & \\int d\\omega_d |x|^{d-1 } n_\\mu f_\\mu(x )   =   0   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a rapidly decreasing and vanishing function at infinity : @xmath214 where @xmath215 is the solid angle .    in the case of the non - local theory , however , the total derivative term can not be neglected , even if the integrand @xmath216 is a rapidly decreasing function in @xmath217 : @xmath218   = &   \\int_v d^dy \\int_{s=\\partial v } d^{d-1 } s_\\mu(x ) [ f(x - y)g_\\mu(y ) ]   \\nonumber\\\\   = & \\int_{s=\\partial v } d^{d-1 } s_\\mu(x ) \\int_v d^dy [ f(x - y)g_\\mu(y ) ]   \\ne    0   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because a contribution from @xmath219 such that @xmath220 always remain due to the existence of an additional integral @xmath221 over the whole volume @xmath222 . even after applying the gauss theorem , we have still another volume integral and the integrand is not limited to the region far from the origin .",
    "thus , if one neglects the total derivative term in the non - local theory , one is led to a theory with different physical content .",
    "it is a good place to note that , in order to obtain the modified brst symmetry in @xcite , integration by parts , i.e. , neglection of the total derivative has been used as usual .",
    "however , this is safe , because it is done in the localized gribov - zwanziger theory .",
    "it should be remarked that our result differs from the zwanziger result @xcite .",
    "the essential difference between his result and ours comes from the estimation of @xmath223 .",
    "in fact , if the contribution from this term was neglected , the average of the horizon function became equal to ( instead of ( [ r1 ] ) ) @xmath224 and the horizon condition @xmath225 would become indeed equivalent to the kugo - ojima criterion @xmath226 as claimed in @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath227 does not vanish and remains non - zero even after taking the @xmath228 limit , as we have examined in the previous paper @xcite , which is also the case for @xmath11 .",
