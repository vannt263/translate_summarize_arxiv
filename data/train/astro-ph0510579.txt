    "spectroscopy has enabled accurate classification of the components , while physical association is deduced from the angular proximity , similar spectrophotometric distances and common proper motion of the two components .",
    "we find that while this system , cfht - pl-18ab and lp  724 - 37ab may be wider than most m and l dwarf binaries discovered to date , all three remain well constrained by empirical separation limit trends deduced from high resolution imaging surveys .",
    "this is not the case , however , for the young wide binaries gg  tau  bab , 2mass  1207@xmath03932ab and 2mass  1101@xmath07732ab , and the recently identified field pair denis  0551@xmath04434ab . these four systems may prove to be exceptions to empirical separation trends , or an indication that these trends do not adequately represent the outcome of low mass star and brown dwarf formation .",
    "a dedicated survey is required to address these possibilities .",
    "well - resolved m dwarf / l dwarf binaries such as denis  2200@xmath03038ab are valuable for studies of dust formation and activity trends at these spectral types , and characterization of the individual components of these systems should be done to probe these processes in detail .",
    "the authors would like to thank telescope operator paul sears and instrument specialist john rayner for their assistance during the observations , and our referee suzanne hawley for her rapid and thorough review of the original manuscript .",
    "we also thank kelle cruz for providing spex spectral data of 2mass  0345 + 2540 , and michael cushing for consultation on the spectral data reduction .",
    "ajb acknowledges useful discussions with peter allen , laird close , kelle cruz , i.  neill reid and nick siegler during the preparation of the manuscript .",
