    "the study of networks has attracted a substantial amount of attention from the physics community in the last few years  @xcite , in part because of networks broad utility as representations of real - world complex systems and in part because of the demonstrable successes of physics techniques in shedding light on networked phenomena .",
    "one topic that has been the subject of a particularly large volume of work is growing networks , such as citation networks  @xcite and the worldwide web  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the best - known body of work on this topic is that dealing with `` preferential attachment '' models  @xcite , in which vertices are added to a network with edges that attach to preexisting vertices with probabilities depending on those vertices degrees .",
    "when the attachment probability is precisely linear in the degree of the target vertex the resulting degree sequence for the network follows a yule distribution in the limit of large network size , meaning it has a power - law tail  @xcite .",
    "this case is of special interest because both citation networks and the worldwide web are observed to have degree distributions that approximately follow power laws .",
    "the preferential attachment model may be quite a good model for citation networks , which is one of the cases for which it was originally proposed  @xcite .",
    "for other networks , however , and especially for the worldwide web , it is , as many authors have pointed out , necessarily incomplete  @xcite . on the web",
    "there are clearly other processes taking place in addition to the deposition of vertices and edges .",
    "in particular , it is a matter of common experience that vertices ( i.e. ,  web pages ) are often removed from the web , and with them the links that they had to other pages .",
    "models of this process have been touched upon occasionally in the literature  @xcite and the evidence suggests that in some cases vertex deletion affects the crucial power - law behavior of the degree distribution , while in other cases it does not .    in this paper , we study the general process in which a network grows ( or , potentially , shrinks ) by the constant addition and removal of vertices and edges .",
    "we show that a class of such processes can be solved exactly for the degree distributions they generate by solving differential equations governing the probability generating functions for those distributions .",
    "in particular , we give solutions for three example problems of this type , having uniform or preferential attachment , and having stationary size or net growth .",
    "the case of uniform attachment and stationary size is of interest as a possible model for the structure of peer - to - peer filesharing networks , while the preferential - attachment stationary - size case displays a nontrivial stretched exponential form in the tail of the degree distribution .",
    "our solution of the preferential attachment case with net growth confirms earlier results indicating that this process generates a power - law distribution , although the exponent of the power - law diverges as the growth rate tends to zero , giving degree distributions that are numerically indistinguishable from exponential for small growth rates .",
    "this suggests that the clear power law seen in the real worldwide web is a signature of a network whose rate of vertex accrual far outstrips the rate at which vertices are removed .",
    "the relative rates of addition and removal could , however , change as the web matures , possibly leading to a loss of power - law behavior at some point in the future .",
    "consider a network that evolves by the addition and removal of vertices . in each unit of time , we add a single vertex to the network and remove  @xmath0 vertices .",
    "when a vertex is removed so too are all the edges incident on that vertex , which means that the degrees of the vertices at the other ends of those edges will decrease .",
    "non - integer values of  @xmath0 are permitted and are interpreted in the usual stochastic fashion .",
    "( for example , values @xmath1 can be interpreted as the probability per unit time that a vertex is removed . )",
    "the value @xmath2 corresponds to a network of fixed size in which there is vertex turnover but no growth ; values @xmath1 correspond to growing networks . in principle",
    "one could also look at values @xmath3 , which correspond to shrinking networks , and the methods derived here are applicable to that case .",
    "however , we are not aware of any real - world examples of shrinking networks in which the asymptotic degree distribution is of interest , so we will not pursue the shrinking case here .",
    "we make two further assumptions , which have also been made by most previous authors in studying these types of systems : ( 1 )  that all vertices added have the same initial degree , which we denote  @xmath4 ; ( 2 )  that the vertices removed are selected uniformly at random from the set of all extant vertices .",
    "note however that we will not assume that the network is uncorrelated ( i.e. ,  that it is a random multigraph conditioned on its degree distribution as in the so - called configuration model ) .",
    "in general the networks we consider will have correlations among the degrees of their vertices but our solutions will nonetheless be exact .",
    "let @xmath5 be the fraction of vertices in the network at a given time that have degree  @xmath6 . by definition",
    ", @xmath5  has the normalization @xmath7 our primary goal in this paper will to evaluate exactly the degree distribution  @xmath5 for various cases of interest .",
    "although the form of @xmath5 is , as we will see , highly nontrivial in most cases , the mean degree of a vertex @xmath8 is easily derived in terms of the parameters  @xmath0 and  @xmath4 .",
    "the mean number of vertices added to the network per unit time is @xmath9 .",
    "the mean number of edges removed when a randomly chosen vertex is removed from the network is by definition  @xmath10 .",
    "thus the mean number of edges added to the network per unit time is @xmath11 . for a graph of @xmath12 edges and @xmath13 vertices ,",
    "the mean degree is @xmath14 .",
    "after time  @xmath15 we have @xmath16 and , assuming that @xmath10 has an asymptotically constant value , @xmath17 .",
    "thus @xmath18 or , rearranging , @xmath19 in the special case @xmath2 of a constant - size network , this gives @xmath20 , which is clearly the correct answer .",
    "we must also consider how an added vertex chooses the @xmath4 other vertices to which it attaches .",
    "let us define the attachment kernel  @xmath21 to be @xmath13 times the probability that a given edge of a newly added vertex attaches to a given preexisting vertex of degree  @xmath6 .",
    "the factor of @xmath13 here is convenient , since it means that the total probability that the given edge attaches to any vertex of degree  @xmath6 is simply @xmath22 . since each edge must attach to a vertex of _ some _ degree , this",
    "also immediately implies that the correct normalization for @xmath21 is @xmath23    for the particular case of @xmath24 and @xmath1 , which we consider in section  [ sec : prefgrow ] , models similar to ours have been studied previously by chung and lu  @xcite and by cooper , frieze , and vera  @xcite .",
    "the results reported by these authors are mostly of a different nature to ours , but there are some overlaps , which we discuss at the appropriate point .      given these definitions , the evolution of the degree distribution is governed by a rate equation as follows . if there are at total of @xmath13 vertices in the network at a given time then the number of vertices with degree  @xmath6 is  @xmath25 .",
    "one unit of time later this number is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the new value of  @xmath5 . then @xmath28 the term @xmath29 in eq .   represents the addition of a vertex of degree  @xmath4 to the network .",
    "the terms @xmath30 and @xmath31 describe the flow of vertices from degree @xmath32 to  @xmath6 and from @xmath6 to @xmath33 as they gain extra edges when newly added vertices attach to them .",
    "the terms @xmath34 and @xmath35 describe the flow from degree @xmath33 to  @xmath6 and from @xmath6 to @xmath32 as vertices loose edges when one of their neighbors is removed from the network .",
    "and the term @xmath36 represents the removal with probability  @xmath0 of a vertex with degree  @xmath6 .",
    "contributions from processes in which a vertex gains or loses two or more edges in a single unit of time vanish in the limit of large  @xmath13 and have been neglected .",
    "we will be interested in the asymptotic form of @xmath5 in the limit of large times for a given  @xmath21 .",
    "setting @xmath37 in   gives @xmath38 whose solution we can write in terms of generating functions as follows .",
    "let us define @xmath39 then , upon multiplying both sides of   by @xmath40 and summing over  @xmath6 ( with the convention that @xmath41 ) , we derive a differential equation for @xmath42 thus : @xmath43 note also that we can easily generalize our model to the case where the degrees of the vertices added are not all identical but are instead drawn at random from some distribution  @xmath44 . in that case",
    ", we simply replace @xmath29 in eq .   with @xmath44 and @xmath45 in eq .   with the generating function @xmath46 .    in the following sections we solve eq .   for a number of different choices of the attachment kernel  @xmath21 .",
    "note that , since the definitions of both @xmath47 and @xmath42 incorporate the unknown distribution  @xmath5 , we must in general solve implicitly for @xmath42 in terms of  @xmath47 . in all of the cases of interest to us here",
    ", however , it turns out to be straightforward to derive a explicit equation for @xmath42 as a special case of  .",
    "in this section we study three specific examples of the class of models defined in the preceding section , namely linear preferential attachment models ( @xmath24 ) for both growing and fixed - size networks , and uniform attachment ( @xmath48 ) for fixed size .",
    "as we will see , each of these cases turns out to have interesting features .      for the first of our example models we study the case where the size of the network is constant ( @xmath2 ) and in which each vertex added chooses the @xmath4 others to which it attaches uniformly at random .",
    "this means that @xmath21 is constant , independent of  @xmath6 , and , combining eqs .   and",
    ", we immediately see that the correct normalization for the attachment kernel is @xmath49 for all  @xmath6 .",
    "then we have @xmath50 so that @xmath51 in  , which gives @xmath52 noting that @xmath53 is an integrating factor and that @xmath42 must obey the boundary condition @xmath54 , we readily determine that @xmath55,\\quad \\label{eq : solngz1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the incomplete @xmath57-function",
    ".    one can easily check that this gives a mean degree @xmath58 , as it must , and that the variance of the degree @xmath59 is equal to @xmath60 , indicating a tightly peaked degree distribution .    to obtain an explicit expression for the degree distribution , we make use of @xmath61 to write @xmath62 .",
    "\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq : gzrewrite}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath63-dependence in the first term of this expression can be rewritten @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes the smaller of @xmath6 and @xmath4 and we have again employed  .",
    "a similar sequence of manipulations leads to an expression for the second term also , thus : @xmath66 combining these identities with  , it is then a simple matter to read off the term in @xmath42 involving  @xmath40 , which is by definition our  @xmath5 .",
    "we find two separate expressions for the cases of @xmath6 above or below  @xmath4 : @xmath67        { \\gamma(k+1,c)\\over\\gamma(k+1)},\\nonumber\\\\      & & \\hspace{13em}\\mbox{for $ k < c$ } , \\label{eq : pkkltc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath68,\\quad\\mbox{for $ k\\ge c$}. \\label{eq : pkkgtc}\\ ] ] note that the quantity @xmath69 appearing in both these expressions is the probability that a poisson - distributed variable with mean @xmath4 is less than or equal to  @xmath6 .",
    "thus the degree distribution has a tail that decays as the cumulative distribution of such a poisson variable , implying that it falls off rapidly . to see this more explicitly",
    ", we note that for fixed  @xmath4 and @xmath70 @xmath71 since the sum is strongly dominated in this limit by its first term . applying stirling s approximation ,",

    "the points represent data from numerical simulations and the solid line is the analytic solution . ]    as a check on these calculations , we have performed extensive computer simulations of the model . in fig .",
    "[ fig : uniform ] we show results for the case @xmath75 , along with the exact solution from eqs .   and  .",
    "as the figure shows , the agreement between the two is excellent .    before moving on to other issues , we note a different and particularly simple case of a growing network with uniform attachment , the case in which the vertices added have a poisson degree distribution @xmath76 with mean  @xmath4 . in that case",
    "the factor of @xmath45 in eq .   is replaced with the generating function  @xmath77 for the poisson distribution : @xmath78 and the solution , eq .  , becomes @xmath79 which is itself the generating function for a poisson distribution .",
    "thus we see particularly clearly in this case that the equilibrium degree distribution in the steady - state uniform attachment network is sharply peaked with a poisson tail .",
    "in fact , the network in this case is simply an uncorrelated random graph of the type famously studied by erds and rnyi  @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to see that if one starts with such a graph and randomly adds and removes vertices with poisson distributed degrees , the graph remains an uncorrelated random graph with the same degree distribution , and hence this distribution is necessarily the fixed point of the evolution process , as the solution above demonstrates .",
    "our next example adds an extra degree of complexity to the picture : we consider vertices that attach to others in proportion to their degree , the so - called `` preferential attachment '' mechanism  @xcite .",
    "this implies that our attachment kernel @xmath21 is linear in the degree , @xmath80 for some constant  @xmath81 .",
    "the normalization requirement   then implies that @xmath82 and hence @xmath83 . for the moment , let us continue to focus on the case @xmath2 of constant network size , in which case @xmath20 ( eq .  ) and @xmath84 then @xmath85 and eq",

    "then , the degree distribution @xmath5 is given by the coefficients of @xmath40 in @xmath102 .",
    "we determine these coefficients as follows . changing the variable of integration to @xmath103",
    ", we find @xmath104 then we expand the integrand to get @xmath105 commuting the sum and the integral , we obtain @xmath106 where @xmath107 and for @xmath108 @xmath109 integrating by parts , we obtain a slightly simpler expression , @xmath110    while the coefficients @xmath111 can be expressed exactly using hypergeometric functions , a perhaps more informative approach is to employ a saddle - point expansion .",
    "the integrand of   is unimodal in the interval between 1 and @xmath112 , and peaks at @xmath113 .",
    "approximating the integrand as a gaussian around this point , we obtain as @xmath114 @xmath115 and @xmath116 for @xmath101 as stated above .     and @xmath75 with linear preferential attachment .",
    "the points represent data from our numerical simulations and the solid line is the analytic solution for @xmath117 .",
    "note that the tail of the distribution does not follow a power law as in growing networks with preferential attachment , but instead decays faster than a power law , as a stretched exponential . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : pref ] shows the form of this solution for the case @xmath75 . also shown in the figure",
    "are results from computer simulations of the model on systems of size @xmath74 with @xmath75 , which agree well with the analytic results .",
    "the appearance of the stretched exponential in eq .   is worthy of note .",
    "we are aware of only a few cases of graphs with stretched exponential degree distributions that have been discussed previously , for instance in growing networks with sublinear preferential attachment  @xcite as well as in empirical network data  @xcite .",
    "we now come to the third and most complex of our example networks , in which we combine preferential attachment with net growth of the network , @xmath1 .",
    "( logically , we should perhaps first solve the case of a growing network without preferential attachment , which in fact we have done .",
    "but the solution turns out to have no qualitatively new features to distinguish it from the constant size case and is mathematically tedious besides .",
    "given the large amount of effort it requires and its modest rewards , therefore , we prefer to skip this case and move on to more fertile ground . )    as before , perfect linear preferential attachment implies @xmath118 or @xmath119 where we have made use of eq .  .",
    "then @xmath120 and eq .",
    "becomes @xmath121\\,{{\\mathrm{d}}g\\over{\\mathrm{d}}z } = z^c .",
    "\\label{eq : lastreq}\\ ] ] an integrating factor for the left - hand side in this case is @xmath122 where @xmath123 .",
    "( note that @xmath124 when @xmath1 . ) unfortunately , this integrating factor is non - analytic at @xmath125 , which makes integrals traversing this point cumbersome . to circumvent this difficulty , we observe that the second term in eq .   vanishes at @xmath125 , giving @xmath126",
    "this provides us with an alternative boundary condition on  @xmath42 , allowing us to fix the integrating constant while only integrating up to  @xmath125 .",
    "it is then straightforward to show that @xmath127 for @xmath128 . since the degree distribution is entirely determined by the behavior of @xmath42 at the origin , it is adequate to restrict our solution to this regime .",

    "if we expand the last factor in the integrand , this becomes @xmath132    we observe the following useful identity : @xmath133 where the second equality is derived via integration by parts .",
    "setting @xmath134 and @xmath135 and noting that the last integral has the same form as the first , we can employ this identity iteratively @xmath136 times to get @xmath137.\\qquad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the final sum can be evaluated in closed form in terms of the incomplete @xmath57-function , but our primary focus here is on the preceding term . substituting into eq .  , we see that @xmath138 , where @xmath139 @xmath140 and @xmath98 is a polynomial of order @xmath99 in  @xmath63 .",
    "since @xmath141 depends only on @xmath4 and  @xmath0 and @xmath98 has no terms in @xmath63 of order @xmath45 or higher , the degree distribution for @xmath117 is , to within a multiplicative constant , given by the coefficients in the expansion of @xmath77 about zero . making the change of variables @xmath142",
    "we find that @xmath143 and expanding the integrand in powers of  @xmath63 we obtain @xmath144 with @xmath145 for @xmath108 , where the second equality follows via an integration by parts .",
    "as in the case of constant size , we can express these coefficients in closed form using special functions , but if we are primarily interested in the form of the tail of the degree distribution then a more revealing approach is to make a further substitution @xmath146 , giving @xmath147 in the limit of large  @xmath6 this becomes @xmath148 and @xmath149 for @xmath101 as stated above .",
    "thus the tail of the degree distribution follows a power law with exponent  @xmath150 .",
    "note that this exponent diverges as @xmath151 so that the power law becomes ever steeper as the growth rate slows , eventually assuming the stretched exponential form of eq .",
    "steeper than any power law  in the limit @xmath2 . in the limit @xmath152",
    "we recover the established power - law behavior @xmath153 for growing graphs with preferential attachment and no vertex removal  @xcite .",
    ", @xmath75 .",
    "the solid line represents the analytic solution , eqs .  , and  , for @xmath154 and the points represent simulation results for systems with final size @xmath155 vertices . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : prefgrow ] we show the form of the degree distribution for this model for the case @xmath156 , @xmath75 , along with numerical results from simulations of the model on networks of ( final ) size @xmath155 vertices .",
    "the power - law behavior is clearly visible on the logarithmic scales used as a straight line in the tail of the distribution .",
    "once again the analytic solution and simulations are in excellent agreement .",
    "we note that chung and lu  @xcite and cooper , frieze , and vera  @xcite have independently demonstrated power - law behavior in the degree distribution of growing networks , using models similar to ours .",
    "their results are asymptotic approximations describing the tail of the distribution , rather than exact solutions , but they find the same dependence of the exponent on the growth rate .",
    "in this paper we have studied models of the time evolution of networks in which , in addition to the widely considered case of addition of vertices , we also include vertex removal .",
    "we have given exact solutions for cases in which vertices are added and removed at the same rate , a potential model for steady - state networks such as peer - to - peer networks , and cases in which the rate of addition exceeds the rate of removal , which we regard as a simple model for the growth of , for example , the worldwide web .",
    "we find very different behaviors in these various cases . for a steady - state network",
    "in which newly added vertices attach to others at random we find a degree distribution , eqs",
    ".   and  , which is sharply peaked about its maximum and has a rapidly decaying ( poisson ) tail .",
    "this distribution is quite unlike the right - skewed degree distributions found in many real - world networks , but as a possible form for a `` designed '' network such as a peer - to - peer network it might be preferable over skewed forms , being more homogeneous and hence distributing traffic more evenly .",
    "if newly appearing vertices attach to others using a linear preferential attachment mechanism , whereby vertices gain new edges in proportion to the number they already possess , we find that the degree distribution becomes a stretched exponential , eqs .   and  , a substantially broader distribution than that of the random attachment case , though still more rapidly decaying than the power laws often seen in growing networks .    and in the case where the network shows net growth , adding vertices faster than it loses them , we find that the degree distribution follows a power law , eqs .   and  , with an exponent @xmath157 that assumes values in the range @xmath158 , diverging as the growth rate tends to zero .",
    "this last result is of interest for a number of reasons .",
    "first , it shows that power - law behavior can be rigorously established in networks that grow but also lose vertices .",
    "most previous analytic models of network growth have focused solely on vertex addition . and while the real worldwide web and other networks appear to have degree distributions that closely follow power laws , these networks also clearly lose vertices as well as gaining them .",
    "the results presented here demonstrate that the widely studied mechanism of preferential attachment for generating power - law behavior also works in this regime .",
    "on the other hand , the large values of the exponent  @xmath157 generated by our model appear not to be in agreement with the behavior observed in real - world networks , most of which have exponents in the range from 2 to  3  @xcite .",
    "there are well - known mechanisms that can reduce the exponent from 3 to values slightly lower  specifically the generalization of the preferential attachment model to the case of a directed network  @xcite , which is in any case a more appropriate model for the worldwide web . in the limit of low growth rate , however , our model predicts a diverging exponent and , while the exact value may not be accurate because of a host of complicating factors , it seems likely that the divergence itself is a robust phenomenon ; as other authors have commented , there are good reasons to believe that net growth is one of the fundamental requirements for the generation of power - law degree distributions by the kind of mechanisms considered here .    thus the fact that we do not observe very large exponents in real networks appears to indicate that most networks are in a regime where growth dominates over vertex loss by a wide margin .",
    "it is possible however that this will not always be the case .",
    "the web , for example , has certainly being enjoying a period of very vigorous growth since its appearance in the early 1990s , but it could be that this is a sign primarily of its youth , and that as the network matures its size will grow more slowly , the vertices added being more nearly balanced by those taken away . were this to happen , we would expect to see the exponent of the degree distribution grow larger .",
    "a sufficiently large exponent would make the distribution indistinguishable experimentally from an exponential or stretched exponential distribution , although we do not realistically anticipate seeing behavior of this type any time in the near future .",
