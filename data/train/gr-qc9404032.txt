    "relations between finite simple groups , simple singularities and simply laced lie groups , denoted by the cartan series a , d and e , are wellknown@xmath3 , but have not been used so far to tie up a particle s inner symmetry , expressed by an ade lie group , explicitly to local space - time geometry near the particle .",
    "this geometry is assumed to be given as a vertex structure in a @xmath1-dimensional topological model of observation , which is based on a network of spatial world tubes evolving in time .",
    "the present approach , inspired by string theory@xmath4 , differs from that by working a priori in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "breaking of conformal symmetry is considered here as naturally given by the global topology of space - time and the structure of observation .",

    "5 describes the singularities of the a and d series explicitly on characteristic algebraic hypersurfaces in @xmath6 , following essentially the original work of f. klein@xmath7 .",
    "6 reviews deformations of simple singularities@xmath8 and presents a theorem@xmath9 , wellknown to algebraic topologists rather than physicists , which allows to decide the existence of certain deformations of the singularities by a graph theoretical method . by the latter",
    "the relation to symmetry breaking transitions between the associated ade lie groups becomes evident .",
    "this together with sec . 3 has recently encouraged the author to conjecture@xmath10 a close relation of ade symmetries and local structure of observation in space - time .    in sec .",
    "7 the geometric structure of the resolution of singularities of series a is described explicitly . a properly chosen real section can be identified with some vertex of the model presented in sec .",
    "2 . this confirms the conjecture above .",
    "finally we discuss the perspective of results for this model .",
    "starting with @xmath11 vertices and demanding any of them being connected to any other one by a stringy world tube , the lowest dimension allowing the connections to be nonintersecting is @xmath12 , which shall be the case .",
    "up to sec .",
    "6 the vertices are assumed to contain a",
    " possible point of observation \" ( ppo ) each . from any vertex",
    "there are @xmath13 tubes going out , as the only possibility to exchange information with other vertices .",
    "the whole worldsheet shall be closed .",
    "this structure is assumed to be embedded in some spacelike section @xmath14 of the lorentzian part @xmath15 of a classical space - time and to evolve in @xmath16 according to a synchronized time of one of the ppos , which will be called ",
    "the observer \" o. since all @xmath11 ppos are equal , anyone of them could observe a likewise system of @xmath13 vertices .",
    "this fact is called  democracy \" . fig .",
    "1 shows an example of 5 vertices connected to each other and all other ones .",
    "unification / separation of a single pair of vertices yields separation/ unification of @xmath13 pairs of points on the worldsheet after pinching / before blowing up n ( closed ) strings respectively :    ll    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     in sl(2,c ) the cyclic group of order @xmath13 is represented as @xmath17 with @xmath18 obviously x=@xmath19 , u=@xmath20 , v=@xmath21 are 3 independent @xmath22-invariants , satisfying q=0 .",
    "thus the 3 generic @xmath22-invariant polynomials with r=0 are @xmath23 now let us go over to the d series : the binary dihedral group @xmath24 is represented in sl(2,c ) by combining @xmath25 with @xmath26 note that @xmath27 .",
    "it is now easy to verify that @xmath28 are 3 independent @xmath24-invariant polynomials , which satisfy just the constraint @xmath29 given above .",
    "the lowest order nontrivial group of this series is @xmath30 .",
    "its projection onto @xmath31 yields @xmath32 , the kleinian 4-group , which is the unique abelian group of order 4 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    similar like the invariants ( 5.1 ) and ( 5.2 ) for the a resp .",
    "d series one can construct the invariants of type e. the results are already contained in the original work@xmath7 of f. klein .",
    "the following section is devoted to the behavior of the ade singularities under algebraic perturbations .",
    "for the singularity given by @xmath35(x , y , z ) = 0 let us define ( following refs . ,  and )",
    "small deformation ( fiber)s in an @xmath36-neighbourhood of 0 by @xmath37 with @xmath38 small w.r.t . .",
    "clearly @xmath39 is the singularity itself .",
    "@xmath40 is the milnor fiber , which characterizes the resolution , since @xmath41 is just generated by the cycles @xmath42 introduced in sec .",
    "4 . following theorem@xmath43 holds : _ given a simple singularity and independently a dynkin graph g of ade type ( i.e.each connected component of g is of ade type ) .",
    "then the following properties are equivalent : i. there exists a deformation @xmath44 with only simple singularities , such that the combination of these corresponds exactly to g. ii .",
    "g is a subgraph of the basic graph of the singularity . _",
    "similar theorems hold also for larger classes of singularities@xmath9 .",
    "the powerful implication of the theorem above is that it allows to decide just graph theoretically the existence of both , deformations of simple singularities and corresponding symmetry breaking transitions@xmath10 between the associated ade lie groups ( see example in fig .",

    ", the author has conjectured@xmath10 an intimate relation between space - time and observational structure on the on hand and internal ( yang mills like ) symmetries on the other .    in the following section",
    "we describe the geometric structure of some simple singularities explicitly and relate them to the structure of the model of sec .",
    "2 , thus confirming the conjecture above .",
    "let us consider the geometry of the most simple singularity @xmath45 given by the constraint @xmath46 this surface is a double cone with double point singularity at 0 , the 2 cones corresponding to @xmath47 .",
    "it is resolved by a single blow up ( 4.3 ) yielding a surface isomorphic to @xmath48 and the singular fiber is given by the zerosection @xmath49 ( see fig .",
    "@xmath48 is the unique line bundle of chern class -2 and thus it is the standard building block for the resolutions of higher ade singularities involving more fundamental cycles .",
    "4 : resolution of @xmath50     more generally an @xmath51 singularity is given by a surface @xmath52 , with @xmath53 like above .",
    "this surface is built by @xmath11 cones given by @xmath54 with @xmath55 , their tops joining in the singularity 0 .",
    "the resolution can be found by @xmath13 blow ups ( 4.3 ) , with @xmath56 cones left after the @xmath57th blow up .",
    "the resolution is given by a vertex of @xmath11 joining tubes rather than cones .",
    "the singular fiber of the resolution is given by a joining chain of @xmath13 spheres @xmath58 .",
    "this is now demonstrated in detail for @xmath59 ( see fig .",
    "the surface is given by 3 cones joining in a point .",
    "the first blow up yields an @xmath60 like a @xmath61 tube with a cone attached to the image of the zerosection in a point @xmath62 .",
    "this is however not yet a resolution , since @xmath63 is singular in @xmath62 .",
    "applying ( 4.3 ) once more @xmath62 is blown up to a further intersecting the first one just in a point .",
    "this yields the resolution , given by 3 regularly joining tubes .",
    "the singular fiber is the join @xmath64 of 2 spheres .",
    "5 : resolution of @xmath65     in order to relate these complex structures to the real structures of our topological model , let us take a proper real section , such that @xmath66 becomes restricted to @xmath67 and the complex cotangent bundle restricts to the real cotangent bundle @xmath68 .",
    "thus we can identify the tubular strings between ppos as real sections of resolutions of @xmath45 singularities , which themselves might have been created each by 2 points of the worldsheet identifying to a double point .",
    "so @xmath45 singularities and resolution appear naturally in processes like ( 2.1 ) .",
    "until now we have considered any single ppo as vertex with @xmath13 tubes attached .",
    "note however that this point of view can be transformed into a different one by a smooth deformation of the worldsheet replacing any @xmath13-tube vertex replaced by @xmath69 vertices with maximally @xmath70 external tubes ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "taking such a vertex as ppo , the associated 2-sphere would have only @xmath70 punctures .",
    "the most refined decomposition is the tree level with @xmath72 . at this level",
    "any vertex corresponds to a real section of an @xmath73 resolution . generally at level @xmath70",
    "any maximal vertex corresponds to an @xmath74 resolution .",
    "however at any refined level democracy among vertices is broken , since no longer each of them is connected to any other one .",
    "democracy of ppos can be retained if we consider only a whole cluster of @xmath69  confined \" vertices , rather than a simple vertex , as ppo .    note that the resolution by passing in ( 6.1 ) from @xmath75 to @xmath40 with @xmath76 is similar like in qft shifting particles off the singular light cone by giving them a ( small ) nonzero mass .",
    "in fact the geometry of the @xmath45-resolution corresponds to a complex mass shell .",
    "we had chosen real sections , like e.g.in ( 7.1 ) , such that they correspond to the worldsheet structure in a syncronized spacelike section @xmath14 .",
    "note however that the complex structure of the resolution contains various possibilities for real sections and choices of signatures .",
    "recently it was pointed out , how a change of space - time signature may be posssible@xmath77 and interpreted@xmath78 , where instantons play a crucial role . a full space - time analysis of the model of sec .",
    "2 provides an instanton interpretation@xmath79 of geometric structures related to ade singularities .",
    "using a specific model of observation with special emphasis to microscopic democracy of ppos (  possible points of observation \" ) in space - time , conjectures about an intimate relation between inner symmetries of the yang mills type and local structure of observation in space - time near a particle are confirmed .",
    "explicitly the resolution of singularities of the a series appear naturally as vertices of the tubular network which is transporting the information between ppos .",
    "the @xmath45 singularity and its resolution ( corresponding to the su(2 ) symmetry of electroweak interaction ) appears in any unification / separation process of ( ppo ) vertices as pinch / blow up of specific strings on the tubular worldsheet .",
    "abelian u(1 )",
    "factors are not considered in the ade theory but might be represented by ( counter)clockwise twistings of the stringtubes around their axis according to the polarisation of a lightwave propagating along some of them .",
    "the resolutions of the @xmath74 singularities for @xmath80 ( corresponding to a su(@xmath70 ) yang mills symmetry ) have real sections isomorphic to a @xmath70-tube vertex .",
    "confinement might be related to the necessity to consider clusters rather than single vertices as ppos in order to restore democracy at the most refined level @xmath72 .",
    "we have coined the term ppo for an undetermined location somewhere in the interior at a vertex of an extended observer carrying the frame of reference .",
    "in contrast to a quantization of space - time into disconnected parts@xmath81 , our model assumes ( at least in the initial phase considered here ) all ppos to be located in a common connected region , namely the interior of the closed tubular worldsheet .",
    "regions connected only by stringtubes with diameter very much below plancklength @xmath82 should be considered as quasidisconnected , which yields the correspondence to the qfr ( quantum frame of reference ) approach@xmath81 .",
    "string pinchings according to ( 2.1 ) can be performed equivalently around interior and exterior of the tubular worldsheet w.r.t .",
    "the embedding space , both yielding the same unification of vertex tubes .",
    "note the resemblance of the present approach to knot theory and neural networks .    assuming a mean extension of the vertices of only few orders of magnitude above @xmath82 and a mean stringtube diameter of order @xmath82 or below , the ppos become sharp only for @xmath83 in the macroscopic continuum limit @xmath84 . in this limit there should appear a connection to the gauge bundle framework .    by the theorem@xmath9 of sec .",
    "6 , the dynkin graphs describe the possible ade symmetry breaking transitions and deformations of singularities .",
    "notably in our model all this happens a priori in a space - time of @xmath85 rather than decending from @xmath86 .",
    "for an evolutionary process there remains therefore the crucial question , whether a classical space - time ( initial ) singularity appears .",
    "this question is closely related to the question of ppo democracy via the global topology of @xmath14 . furthermore a resolution of a scalefactor singularity corresponds to a deprojection process , similar to those involved in the ade resolutions .",
    "all that indicates a unified description of both the singularities _ in _ and _ of _ space - time .",
    "this and a more detailed evaluation of the physical predictions of the model will be topic of a forthcoming paper . the author would like to thank the unknown referee for his useful comments on the paper .",
    "furthermore he is grateful to h .- j .",
