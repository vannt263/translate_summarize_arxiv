    "we are living inside a region within the milky way disk with extremely low neutral gas densities @xmath3 @xmath4 @xcite and purportedly hot temperature ( @xmath5 k , for more discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "this high temperature was derived based on the distribution of diffuse soft x - ray background emission @xcite .",
    "this large cavity is known as the local bubble ( lb ) or the local cavity @xcite .",
    "the evidence that led to the recognition of the local bubble comprises : ( 1 ) the lack of spectral hardening in the observed soft x - ray background that requires low values of neutral gas absorption @xcite ; ( 2 ) low values of interstellar extinction measured for stars within a distance of @xmath6 100 pc , as compared with the extinction in sightlines of more distant regions in the interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite ; ( 3 ) observations of ly-@xmath7 absorption of nearby stars and column densities , measured by @xcite which showed that this region has a low density .",
    "most of the theoretical models of the local bubble formation favor the production of highly ionized atoms in collisional ionization equilibrium at a conductive interstellar cloud interface @xcite .",
    "high spectral resolution observations have revealed many small and partially ionized gas clouds ( local fluff ) within 30 pc @xcite , thus we expect a significant number of such fluffs at larger distances along sightlines through the local bubble .",
    "therefore the distribution of hot gas remains unresolved .",
    "according to recent observations of neutral ( ) and ionized ( ) atoms , the local bubble is extended to a distance of @xmath6 80 pc in the galactic plane and up to hundreds of pc into the halo @xcite .",
    "also 3d gas maps around the local bubble reveal that this cavity has a chimney like structure with a narrow opening towards the north galactic pole ( tilted at @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) and a wider opening in the southern hemisphere @xcite . since the local bubble and",
    "most surrounding cavities are supposedly filled with hot gas densities , such 3d distributions have been studied with diffuse x - ray background emissions for compare the morphology of the nearby cavities with the soft x - ray data @xcite .    the origin of the local bubble is still unknown .",
    "@xcite found that the majority of the absorptions toward stars in the sco@xmath10cen association ( 170 pc ) have negative radial velocities relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) .",
    "therefore , most of the diffuse clouds in this direction are moving away from the sco@xmath10cen association and are approaching us . currently , the most plausible model is that the local bubble has been created by a number of successive supernovae in the nearby sco@xmath10cen association .",
    "@xcite , inspected one - dimensional multiple explosion models and found that this scenario requires 2@xmath103 supernovae to have occurred in the general vicinity of the sun within the last few million years ( probably 2@xmath105 million years ago ) .",
    "we initiated a high signal to noise spectroscopic survey to map the local bubble through absorption in diffuse interstellar bands .",
    "ism maps of dibs have been created in the recent past , towards the globular clusters @xmath11 centauri @xcite and the tarantula nebula in the large magellanic cloud @xcite .",
    "also the pseudo three@xmath12dimensional map of the 8620   dib within 3 kpc from the sun have been produced @xcite . in the first paper in this series ( @xcite in preparation )",
    "we present the results from the southern hemisphere survey . in this paper",
    ", we present the results from the northern hemisphere survey .",
    "our aim is to ( i ) investigate the dib distribution within and outside the local bubble , and ( ii ) examine the dib correlations with atomic and ionized species in this region .",
    "we begin with a brief discussion in section  [ dib ] of the history and the properties of dibs . in section  [ observ ]",
    "we present the technical aspects of the study , observations and the target selection . in section  [ dataanal ]",
    ", we present the data analysis procedures . in the next three sections",
    ", we discuss the results of various dib properties inside and outside the local bubble , according to their equivalent widths ( ews ) , correlations and uv sensitivity .",
    "finally , in section  [ discus ] , we summarize the implications of our results .",
    "observing the first diffuse interstellar bands , in the spectra of reddened stars , by @xcite was the starting point to the oldest puzzle in stellar spectroscopy that still remains unresolved . while heger argued that dibs are stellar , more than a decade later @xcite argued for the interstellar nature of dibs . at the present , the dibs are known to comprise @xmath13 narrow to broad interstellar absorption features which are observed ubiquitously between 4000 and 10000   @xcite .",
    "dibs are studied toward specific targets or large numbers of stars .",
    "@xcite carried out a complete survey of hd 204827 and hd 183143 to investigate very weak and relatively narrow bands with typical ews down to a few m . over the last decade",
    "many astronomical and laboratory experiments have been accomplished to find and understand dib carriers as well as a number of theoretical studies .",
    "based on these studies , dib candidates could be among an infinite number of large carbon - based `` organic '' molecules @xcite . to extract physical information about dib carriers ,",
    "some correlation studies have been done : ( 1 ) dib correlations with atomic and molecular interstellar species , for instance many studies have considered the   and   dibs correlation with , h@xmath14 , d lines , cai ( 4227.9  ) , ( 3934.8  ) , ki , ch ( 4300.3  ) , ch@xmath2 ( 4232.3  ) , cn ( 3874.6  ) and tiii @xcite , ( 2 ) dib correlations with extinction @xcite and ( 3 ) dib correlations with other dib absorptions ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "dibs are used for different purposes in astronomy .",
    "for instance , the most outstanding dibs in the optical waveband ; @xmath154429 , @xmath165780 and @xmath165797 are empirically known to trace the neutral phase of the ism .",
    "the strength of these dibs are correlated with the reddening e~b - v~ , the neutral hydrogen and the column densities @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 is well - correlated with column density of neutral hydrogen n(h ) ; also , for galactic sightlines which are not in high radiation environments , the dib correlation with n(h ) is stronger than the correlation with e~b - v~. therefore it is possible to estimate n(h ) based on measurement of the equivalent width of @xcite .",
    "there are still ambiguities about dib carriers , for instance the large widths of dibs argue that the carriers could not be atoms in the gas phase . on the other hand , by observing dib features with high resolution spectrographs , some substructures appear in dib profiles which indicate the carriers are large gas - phase molecules @xcite . in addition , dibs react to the strength of the uv field of the local environment @xcite and dib strength varies as a function of uv radiation toward different sightlines @xcite . for extra@xmath12galactic sightlines , observations show that dibs are present only on sightlines with a significant uv bump @xcite . therefore , specific groups of uv resistant molecules , such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , fullerenes and carbon chains are commonly the more acceptable candidates for dib carriers @xcite .    to further our understanding of the dib carriers and study the physical properties of interstellar environments it is important to study dibs behavior in different ism regions .",
    "dib carriers have been ubiquitously detected everywhere , for instance , dibs have been observed in the magellanic clouds @xcite , m31 and m33 @xcite and beyond the milky way in sn host galaxies @xcite .",
    "thearefore we study the dib carriers within the purported hot local bubble and beyound it for investigating the dib behaviours in such environment .",
    "observations were carried out over 35 nights on 10@xmath1215 october 2011 , 1@xmath126 march 2012 , 8@xmath1212 september 2012 , 31 december 2012 to 9 january 2013 and 27 may to 2 june 2013 .",
    "all observations were carried out using the intermediate dispersion spectrograph ( ids ) at the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) at the roque de los muchachos in la palma .",
    "the ids employs a long - slit spectrograph with a set of 16 gratings and two ccds : the blue - sensitive eev10 ccd , and the red+2 detector which is more sensitive in the red ; both ccds have @xmath17 pixels",
    ". one could achieve dispersions between 0.24 and 4 @xmath18pix .",
    "the spatial scale for the eev10 is @xmath19 and for the red+2 is @xmath20 @xmath18pix , and the full unvignetted slit length is @xmath21 .    for our observations we used the 235 mm camera and h1800v ids grating for an effective resolution of 0.31 @xmath18pix .",
    "h1800v was chosen since it provides a high spectral resolution well matched to the typical width of dibs .",
    "we chose 5800   as the central wavelength , in order to cover the major @xmath165780 , @xmath165797 , @xmath165850 , @xmath166196 & @xmath166203 dibs .",
    "a @xmath22 slit yielded spectra in the 5750@xmath126040   region at spectral resolutions of @xmath23 ( or a velocity resolution of @xmath24 km s@xmath25 ) .",
    "the dib detection requires a high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of at least 100 but for detection of very weak absorptions , like the one which was detected by @xcite towards the nearby star @xmath26cru with dib equivalent width of 4 m , we need s / n of at least 2000 .",
    "the seeing varied during these observing nights from 1.1 to 1.9 .",
    "each observing night we obtained more than 60 flat field frames ( quartz lamp ) with exposure times of 13@xmath1215 sec to correct the ccd pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations and eliminate spurious pixels in the frames .",
    "for wavelength calibration , more than 15 arc frames ( cuar+cune ) were taken at the beginning and the end of each observing night .",
    "a large number of bias frames were also recorded .",
    "we observed the targets with 9@xmath1025 science frames for an individual star with an exposure time between 3 to 400 sec depending on the apparent magnitude of the stars to achieve a typical continuum s / n @xmath272000 .",
    "some additional steps were taken in iraf prior to extracting the spectrum with the kpnoslit package .",
    "the data were processed using the ccdred data reduction package .",
    "first , an average bias frame was produced using the imcombine task by stacking @xmath28 bias frames .",
    "then the resultant frame was subtracted to correct a number of poor but recoverable columns . to correct the ccd sensitivity pattern",
    ", we combined flat frames and produced a normalized master flat and divide each science frame by this master flat . after extracting the spectrum and calibrating the wavelength range with arc frames , to increase the s / n ratio up to @xmath29 , by using scombine task",
    "we combined the science frames .",
    "the overall s / n ratio in our study is @xmath29 but in some cases we observed more than 25 frames , and by smoothing the spectrum by a @xmath30 pixels box the s / n reaches to @xmath31 .",
    "all 432 targets have been selected from the 3d na i d lines survey of @xcite .",
    "the detailed list of targets are presented in table 1 of the third paper in this series @xcite . in addition , all of the selected objects have well - known distances from the hipparcos satellite @xcite .",
    "since we wanted to observe the local bubble and its surroundings , we have selected bright stars up to a distance of 200 pc ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . to maximize the uniformity of the observed stars in the map and",
    "increase its covered density area , as well as to observe hot stars ( o , b types ) we observed some cooler stars ( a , f , g & k ) . as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the majority of observed stars are b and a types .",
    "since the saturation level of the ids detector was @xmath32 counts , a small number of targets were rejected due to their extreme brightness ( @xmath33 mag ) . to increase the observing run efficiency , targets with @xmath34 mag",
    "were also rejected from our target list to avoid very long integration times .",
    "the pointing range of the int ( zenith distance @xmath35 and declination range @xmath36 ) , enabled us to observe some southern celestial hemisphere targets , however our targets were predominantly selected from the northern hemisphere . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] our observations cover all of the northern hemisphere .",
    "a few targets were acquired to overlap with the southern sky survey to check the consistency of the measurements .    in this paper",
    "we perform our analysis separately for sightlines inside and outside the local bubble . but given the 3d shape of the local bubble , a chimney like structure , we could not divide inside and outside only based on the distance from the sun ( for example 80 pc in every direction ) . for selecting the stars located inside the local bubble",
    "firstly we select the objects with ew(d@xmath14 ) @xmath37 m , because within the local bubble the is very weak @xcite . then according to their 3d map of and caii ,",
    "we visually identify which one is located inside the local bubble chimney .",
    "quantifying the equivalent widths for dib absorption features is a real challenge in dibs studies . in some cases ,",
    "the dib feature is blended by that of other chemical species . since the dib carriers are unidentified , the shape and the width of the spectral profiles remain uncertain . besides overlap with other species , there is a possibility for blending with features from higher rotational levels of the same species @xcite .",
    "the equivalent width is defined as :    @xmath38    in this equation , the @xmath39 and @xmath40 are fluxes of the continuum and the spectral line respectively .",
    "also this definition shows that the ew of the line is proportional to the optical depth of the observed gas cloud @xmath41 . for producing a normalized spectrum ,",
    "continuum fitting to the observed spectra was performed by fitting a nine - order legendre polynomial .    since the dib profile is inferred from an overlapping unknown number of atomic absorptions , the overall shape of the dib profile is unknown .",
    "however the equivalent widths , line widths and the central velocities of the and lines can be approximated by a gaussian function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore we obtain the line width in terms of the @xmath42 value of the gaussian distribution , and accordingly the full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) is calculated as fwhm=@xmath43 .",
    "the principal known source of uncertainties on dib s ew are the blending with the stellar lines and other dibs .",
    "one of the sources of blending contamination for is the @xmath44 dib feature @xcite and the probable source of blending to is the @xmath45 dib @xcite . in the case , because of the difference of fwhm for these two dibs the separation is easy but for it is difficult @xcite .",
    "the corresponding statistical uncertainty for each observed dib is computed by standard deviation of residuals of the gaussian fitting and summed in quadrature and weighted by the gaussian fit @xcite .",
    "the statistical error is always underestimated in dib studies , since the main source of error in the equivalent widths is the error in finding the real position of the continuum ( systematic error ) . for computing",
    "this error , we fit three different continuum lines to the local absorption region with @xmath46   range around the central dib wavelengths ( linear fit to the continuum , quadratic fit to the continuum and fit to dib with linear continuum @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , we set the intersection points of the dib absorption and the continuum level @xcite , and then compute equivalent widths",
    ". therefore , the error for systematic uncertainty is determined by the difference between the highest and lowest values of equivalent width among these three ews .    as an example of the quality of the observed data , in fig .",
    "[ spc ] we show some typical and absorptions with the best gaussian fit line to each one . in our observations",
    "the equivalent width of varies between 3 to 250 m  but for some sightlines ( e.g. , hd 183143 ) the ew is near 800 m . in our dataset",
    "the ew varies between 3 to 150 m .      extracting interstellar spectrum features using the observations of cool star spectra containing stellar absorption lines , requires a very accurate synthetic spectrum of the target star to be subtracted from the observed spectrum .    to model a stellar atmosphere ,",
    "the input parameters are effective temperature @xmath47 , surface gravity @xmath48 and micro - turbulence velocity @xmath49 , which leads to calculating the spatial distribution of some physical quantities like : temperature @xmath50 , electron density @xmath51 , population numbers @xmath52 , density @xmath53 , velocity field @xmath54 etc .",
    "we calculate our atmosphere models with the atlas9 code , with correction of iron and iron - peak element opacities @xcite .",
    "we used atlas9 for modeling the stellar atmosphere in our samples , from @xcite who use new opacity distribution functions ( odfs ) for several metallicities . also increase spatial resolution to 72 plane parallel layers from @xmath55 to @xmath56 and update all models with solar abundances @xcite .",
    "for modeling each observed target atmosphere we need the effective temperature of the observed star and the surface gravity @xmath57 .",
    "we obtained these values from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "also we determine target metallicity from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "after modeling the stellar atmosphere we generate the synthetic stellar spectrum with the synthe suite codes @xcite , but we used the linux port @xcite .",
    "atomic and molecular data were taken from the data base on kurucz s website @xcite . also for considering the broadening caused by rotational velocity",
    ", we use the rotational velocity from @xcite and @xcite , and for those stars for which the rotational velocity was not reported we use @xmath58 km s@xmath25 . in our calculations",
    "we included all the atomic and molecular lines with empirically determined atomic constants plus all the diatomic molecular lines ( ch , nh , cn , mgh , sih , sio , h@xmath59 , c@xmath14 and co ) except the tio molecule .      for all targets we carefully searched for the potential contaminating stellar lines .",
    "@xcite showed that for late - b objects there are three stellar lines ( at 5784.45  ) that would contaminate the dib , but this can be easily detectable .",
    "therefore for our late - b type targets we correct the dib absorption according to the above method .",
    "on the other hand , the main sources of a - type star contaminations at are two strong absorptions at 5780.13   and 5780.37   and a nearby at 5783.63  .",
    "there is no source of contamination at @xmath1 .    for",
    "some observed a - type stars that the metallicity have not been reported , we produce all possible synthetic spectra to compare with the observed spectra .",
    "the surface gravity of a - type stars varies between 3.5 to 4.2 @xcite , therefore we choose a constant @xmath60 in all the atmospheric models . from a0 to a9 spectral types , according to @xcite report , we select a constant temperature for luminosity classes i , ii@xmath12iii and iv@xmath12v . also the a - type stars have different metallicities from 0 to @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "accordingly , for a given a - type subdivision ( e.g. , a0 ) and luminosity class ( e.g. , iv ) , we produce three different atmosphere models with [ fe / h ] @xmath62 , and compare with the observed spectrum to choose the best model .",
    "also we consider the effect of rotational velocity convolved with the instrument dispersion .",
    "but the rotational velocity of our observed a - type stars are very high ( @xmath63 km s@xmath25 ) @xcite , thus when convolved with our instrument dispersion , the absorption lines are widened , therefore their impact on the dib absorption will be limited .",
    "then after selecting the best synthetic spectrum for an individual target , we subtract the synthetic spectrum from the observed absorption ( containing both stellar and interstellar absorption features ) to obtain the residual which predominantly consists of the interstellar absorption @xcite .",
    "we then fit a gaussian function to this residual to obtain the equivalent width of the dib ( fig .",
    "[ dibsub ] ) .      the presence of numerous stellar lines in a cool star s spectrum ( f , g , and k types ) leads to an increased contamination in the interstellar absorptions and prevents an accurate determination of the ew , absorption depth , fwhm and the continuum . in these stars",
    "the has a two prong fork shape ( see fig .",
    "[ cooldib ] ) , which is caused by the presence of , , ( all near 5780.1  ) and ( 5781.1  ) .",
    "@xcite studied the 6196 , 6204.5 and 6283.8   dibs and showed that , with the product of a synthetic stellar spectrum , a synthetic telluric transmission and an empirical model for the dib absorption it would be possible to extract the spectrum of the interstellar feature . in our observations since we focus on and @xmath1 , the telluric absorptions are not considerable .",
    "@xcite show that dib transmission profiles @xmath64 can be expressed as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a reference profile derived by high signal to noise observations of early - type stars .",
    "therefore by adjusting the @xmath67 parameters the proper profile for each dib would be produced . according to @xcite ,",

    "[ eqd ] , in an iterative procedure we change the @xmath69 ( peak intensity ) , @xmath70 ( peak center ) and @xmath42 ( peak width ) for each wavelength ( @xmath16 ) to produce a new spectrum .",
    "then we add this spectrum to the corresponding synthetic spectrum , and in each iteration according to eq .",
    "[ eqchi ] , calculate the difference of the re - produced spectrum with the real observed absorption ( @xmath71 ) . eventually , the best dib profile estimation is the one with the smallest @xmath71 value .",
    "@xmath72    in fig .",
    "[ cooldib ] , it is clear that by adding the estimated dib profile ( thick solid line ) to the synthetic spectrum ( dashed line ) , the observed spectrum ( solid line ) is reproduced .",

    "as is clear these targets have strong absorptions and hence the deviation is most probably caused by the difference in the spectral resolution of our observations ( @xmath74 ) and welsh ( @xmath75 ) data .",
    "in addition the differences in the s / n ratio in the sets of measurements as well as the saturation level of both surveys may well play a role too .",

    "therefore , the volume of the local bubble is free of major dense interstellar neutral gas and only has some ionized warm cloudlets of caii .",
    "also they show that beyond @xmath6 80 pc and up to @xmath6 100 pc a dense `` wall '' of neutral gas surrounds the local bubble and the value of @xmath77(k ) increases slowly at this wall .",

    "such variations in r are believed to be due to differences in the mean size of the grains in those sightlines .",
    "however , @xcite showed that dib strengths per unit color excess do not follow the r variations , so this provides a reason to doubt whether the grains themselves can be hosts of the carriers .    to investigate the dib correlation with visual reddening , we divide our data into two different groups .",

    "this suggests that in @xmath86 sightlines the denser , dustier cores of clouds become more dominant , increasing the reddening but not leading to a similar increase in absorption as this dib carrier resides in the more diffuse gas .",
    "in contrast , the and reddening relation is steeper in @xmath86 sightlines because the carrier is more closely associated with denser parts of clouds where it is shielded from uv radiation . * the @xmath90 ratio increases with @xmath95nai d@xmath96caii@xmath97 ratio .",

    "<S> we observed 432 sightlines to a distance of 200 pc over a duration of 3 years . in this study , we establish the and correlations with nai , and e~b - v~ , for both inside and outside the local bubble . </S>",
    "<S> the correlations show that among all neutral and ionized atoms , the correlation between caii and @xmath0 is stronger than its correlation with @xmath1 , suggesting that @xmath0 is more associated with regions where ca@xmath2 is more abundant . </S>",
    "<S> we study the correlation with @xmath1 , which shows a tight correlation within and outside the local bubble . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we investigate the dib properties in uv irradiated and uv shielded regions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , within and beyond the local bubble , is located in denser parts of clouds , protected from uv irradiation , while is located in the low density regions of clouds . </S>"
