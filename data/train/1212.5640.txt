    "all massive galaxies appear to host a supermassive black hole ( with @xmath4 ) at their center @xcite . measuring the mass of central black holes in galaxies is of great importance , as the discovery of a relationship between mass and the velocity dispersion of the stars in the central bulge , the @xmath3 relation @xcite , reveals the possible co - evolution of black holes and their host galaxies @xcite .",
    "m31 , the andromeda galaxy , is an sb galaxy at a distance of 778 kpc and its nucleus can be observed with excellent spatial resolutions .",
    "@xcite , using data obtained with the stratoscope ii , revealed an asymmetry in the nuclear region of m31 , as the bright nucleus did not coincide with either the center of the bulge or the maximum of the stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "however , @xcite , using observations from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , showed that the galaxy possesses a double nucleus , the two components being called p1 ( the brightest one ) and p2 ( located , approximately , at the center of the bulge ) .",
    "these two components are separated by about @xmath5 .",
    "a model to explain the morphology of the nucleus of m31 was proposed by @xcite and states that p1 and p2 are parts of an eccentric stellar disk around the black hole , with p1 coinciding with the apocenter and the black hole being located at p2 .",
    "several refinements to this model have been put forth @xcite ; @xcite , using _ hst _ data , revealed that the black hole is actually located in a structure embedded in p2 called p3 , which probably corresponds to a cluster of a - type stars .",
    "@xcite , using also _ hst _ data , confirmed that p3 corresponds to a cluster of blue stars around the central black hole .",
    "the mass of the central black hole of m31 has already been measured by , at least , six different techniques : ( 1 ) standard dynamical modeling ignoring asymmetries @xcite ; ( 2 ) the center of mass argument , which depends on the asymmetry of p1+p2 @xcite ; ( 3 ) dynamical modeling of the stellar nuclear disk taking into account the asymmetry of p1+p2 @xcite ; ( 4 ) complete dynamical modeling taking into account the asymmetries and the self - gravity of the nuclear stellar disk of p1+p2 @xcite ; ( 5 ) dynamical modeling of p3 , which is independent of p1+p2 @xcite ; ( 6 ) _",
    "n_-body simulations @xcite .",
    "all of these methods involved stellar dynamics and resulted in values in the range @xmath6 for the mass of the central black hole in m31 .    in this letter",
    ", we analyze a data cube of the nuclear region of m31 , obtained with the integral field unity ( ifu ) of the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) of the gemini north telescope , and report the discovery of an eccentric h@xmath0 emitting disk around the central black hole .",
    "the observations of m31 were made on 2009 september 21 .",
    "we used the ifu of the gmos of the gemini north telescope , in the one - slit mode , in order to obtain data cubes , with two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension .",
    "the science field of view ( fov ) has @xmath7 , while the sky fov ( observed simultaneously at a distance of @xmath8 from the science fov ) has @xmath9 .",
    "three 10 minute exposure of the nuclear region of m31 were made , with the grating b600-g5307 , in a central wavelength of @xmath10 .",
    "the final spectra had a coverage of @xmath11 and a resolution of @xmath12 .",
    "the estimated seeing for the night of observation was @xmath13 .",
    "standard calibration images were obtained during the observations .",
    "the data reduction was made in iraf environment . at the end of the process",
    ", three data cubes were obtained , with spaxels of @xmath14 .",
    "no sky subtraction was applied because the sky fov ( still inside the disk of m31 ) was contaminated with stellar emission from the galaxy .",
    "after the data reduction , we performed a procedure of data treatment .",
    "first , a correction of the differential atmospheric refraction was applied to all data cubes , using an algorithm developed by our group . in order to combine the three corrected data cubes into one ,",
    "a median of these data cubes was calculated .",
    "after that , a butterworth spatial filtering @xcite , with order @xmath15 , was applied to all the images of the resulting data cube , in order to remove spatial high - frequency noise .",
    "finally , a richardson - lucy deconvolution @xcite was applied to all the images of the data cube , using a synthetic gaussian point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the psf of the final data cube has fwhm @xmath16 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows an image of the final data cube of m31 ( obtained after the data treatment ) collapsed along the spectral axis and an average spectrum of this data cube .",
    "the brightest component of the nucleus , p1 , can be easily detected ; however , the fainter components , p2 and p3 , can not be seen , due to the spatial resolution and to the lack of spectral sensitivity in the blue ( below @xmath17 ) . a spectrum of p1 , extracted from a circular area with a radius of @xmath18 , is also shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the average signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , of the spectra of the data cube analyzed here is close to 50 .",
    "after the data treatment , a spectral synthesis was applied to the spectrum of each spaxel of the resulting data cube of m31 . this procedure was performed with the starlight software @xcite , which fits the stellar spectrum of a given object with a combination of template stellar spectra from a pre - established base . in this work",
    ", we used the base of stellar spectra miles ( medium resolution int library of empirical spectra ; snchez - blzquez et al .",
    "the spectral synthesis resulted in a synthetic stellar spectrum for each spaxel .",
    "these synthetic spectra were then subtracted from the observed ones , leaving a data cube with emission lines only .",
    "the non subtraction of the sky field during the data reduction had no observable effect in the results obtained with the spectral synthesis .    in this residual data cube ,",
    "we have detected a previously unreported weak extended h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the luminosity of this h@xmath0 emission line , within a radius of @xmath21 from the central black hole , is @xmath22 ; the equivalent width of this line is @xmath23 , while that of the absorption component is @xmath24 , indicating that the extended h@xmath0 emission is much weaker than the stellar component and , therefore , hard to detect .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the spectral fit of the h@xmath0 absorption line in one spectrum of the data cube of m31 and also the fit residuals .",
    "it is possible to detect traces of an h@xmath0 emission line immersed in the absorption component , however , only the subtraction of the spectral fit allowed a clear visualization of this very weak emission line . figure  [ fig2 ] also reveals the presence of h@xmath25 and [ o iii]@xmath26 emission lines .",
    "the spectral resolution of the base of stellar spectra miles ( fwhm = @xmath27 ) is very similar to our spectral resolution ( fwhm = @xmath28 ) and , because of that , the spectral fit is quite precise and allows an accurate subtraction of the stellar emission ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the spectra of the data cube of m31 were resampled to @xmath29 ( the same spectral sampling of miles spectra ) , before the spectral synthesis was applied .    in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    ", we can see a map of the integrated flux of the h@xmath0 emission line .",
    "only the central region of the fov of the data cube was taken into account here , because the h@xmath0 emission was too faint farther away .",
    "we can see two bright areas in the vicinity of p1 and p2 , respectively .",
    "this reveals a certain similarity between the extended h@xmath0 emission and the double nucleus of m31 and suggests the existence of a possible h@xmath0 emitting disk .",
    "an elongated emitting region from se toward nw can also be seen ; however , we do not know the origin of this peculiarity in the morphology of the extended h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the area with masked values in the map corresponds to an emitting region , observed in previous studies @xcite , that is not associated to the extended h@xmath0 emission detected here .",
    "this emitting region can be identified by observing its intense , compact , and narrow [ o iii]@xmath30 emission .    in order to obtain a velocity map for h@xmath0 , we fitted a gaussian function to the h@xmath0 emission line in each spectrum of the data cube .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows an example of the gaussian fit applied to the h@xmath0 emission line detected in one spectrum of the data cube , after the subtraction of the spectral fit .",
    "we can see that , despite the irregularities of the emission line , the gaussian fit provides ( with a considerable precision ) the wavelength corresponding to the peak of the emission line and , therefore , the radial velocity . on the other hand , the irregularities observed in the h@xmath0 emission lines , after the subtraction of the spectral fit , made impossible to determine reliable values for the velocity dispersion .",
    "therefore , such values were not taken into account in this work .",
    "the velocity map obtained for the h@xmath0 emission line is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] and it clearly indicates the presence of an h@xmath0 emitting disk around the central black hole . the position angle of the line of nodes of this emitting disk is p.a.@xmath31 = @xmath32 , which is very close to the value measured for the stellar disk in previous studies ( p.a.@xmath33 = @xmath34 ) @xcite .",
    "the contours in figure  [ fig3 ] show that the ascending node of the h@xmath0 emitting disk is very close to p1 , while p2 and p3 are located in an area with low velocities .",
    "this behavior is very similar to what is observed in the stellar disk .",
    "we extracted a velocity curve along the line of nodes ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) and the modulus of the maximum and minimum velocities are considerably different , indicating that any kinematical model should be eccentric .",
    "we tried to reproduce the velocity curve and the velocity map of h@xmath0 using a model of a simple eccentric disk around the supermassive black hole .",
    "only a region within a radius of @xmath21 from the black hole was modeled because , as mentioned before , the disk was too faint farther away .",
    "we admitted that the stellar mass inside the radius of the modeled area was small compared to the mass of the black hole , so no stellar mass was taken into account in the model ( see more details below ) .",
    "the emitting disk was simulated by superposing 33 concentric keplerian orbits with the following free parameters : the argument of the pericenter @xmath35 , the inclination of the disk @xmath36 , the eccentricity of the disk @xmath37 and the mass of the central black hole @xmath38 .",
    "we measured the value of the longitude of the ascending node in the velocity map ( @xmath39 ) , so this parameter was fixed in our model . in each simulation , after all the orbits were superposed , the model was convolved with the estimated psf , in order to simulate the effect of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the free parameters were varied and the simulations were made repeatedly , in order to minimize the value of the @xmath40 between the observed velocity map and the simulated one : + @xmath41 + where @xmath42 is the number of spaxels along the horizontal axis , @xmath43 is the number of spaxels along the vertical axis , @xmath44 is the uncertainty of the velocity of the spaxel @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the velocity of the spaxel @xmath45 of the observed velocity map , @xmath47 is the velocity of the spaxel @xmath45 of the simulated velocity map , @xmath48 is weight equal to 1 for areas near the line of nodes and equal to 0 for farther areas , @xmath49 is the value of the spaxel @xmath45 of the map of integrated fluxes of h@xmath0 ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) , and @xmath50 is the sum of the values of all spaxels of the map of integrated fluxes of h@xmath0 ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) .    in the previous formula ,",
    "the weight @xmath48 is represented by a step function , which is equal to 1 for spaxels closer than @xmath51 to the line of nodes and equal to 0 for farther spaxels .",
    "we used the values of the integrated flux of the h@xmath0 emission line ( @xmath49 ) in the calculation of the @xmath40 in order to give more weight to the spaxels with higher s / n .",
    "the best simulated velocity map and the corresponding best simulated velocity curve are also shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the parameters of the best model obtained , with @xmath52 , are shown in table  [ tbl1 ] . the uncertainties ( 1@xmath2 ) of the parameters",
    "were estimated by plotting histograms ( probability distributions ) of each one of the parameters of the simulation , considering , only cases in which @xmath53 .",
    "after that , we fitted a gaussian function on each histogram and obtained the square deviation , which was taken as the uncertainty of each parameter @xcite .",
    "we can see that , despite some irregularities of the observed velocity map , our model of a simple eccentric disk reproduced the observed kinematical behavior considerably well . in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , however , we can see a clear discrepancy between the observed velocity map and the simulated one in an area near the ascending node .",
    "this is the same emitting region that was masked in the map of the integrated flux of the h@xmath0 emission line ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) , which is not associated to the eccentric disk detected here .",
    "a by - product of this modeling was an independent determination of the position of the black hole .",
    "we found that it is at a distance of @xmath54 from p2 , which is compatible ( at 1@xmath2 level ) with the position of p3 ( at a distance of @xmath55 from p2 ) from previous determinations @xcite .    as mentioned before , in this model",
    ", we have not taken into account the effect of the mass of the stars . in order to evaluate this assumption",
    ", we used an _ hst _ image of the nucleus of m31 in _ v _ band , obtained with wfpc2 , to estimate the stellar mass within the radius of the simulated area .",
    "first , we decomposed this image into an asymmetric component ( containing the stellar disk around the black hole ) and a symmetric one ( containing the central part of the stellar bulge ) .",
    "after that , we de - projected the symmetric component using a multi - gaussian expansion approach @xcite",
    ". finally , the stellar masses of the two components were calculated using a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the results are @xmath57 for the bulge component and @xmath58 for the disk .",
    "together , these two components represent @xmath59 of the @xmath38 we obtained .",
    "that means that this value of @xmath38 resulting from our model can be , at most , @xmath59 too high , due to the neglect of the stellar mass . introducing this in the previous uncertainty for the black hole mass",
    ", we obtain a final value of @xmath60 .",
    "since the spectral synthesis performed on the data cube provided details about the stellar populations detected , we could , in principle , have used a mass - to - light ratio derived from these results to estimate the stellar mass in the nuclear region of m31 .",
    "however , we decided to use a mass - to - light ratio derived from _",
    "observations @xcite because , due to our spatial resolution and lack of spectral sensitivity in the blue ( below @xmath17 ) , we did not observe certain young stellar populations in the nucleus of m31 that were clearly detected in _ hst",
    "_ observations .",
    "we performed an entirely analogous modeling on a stellar velocity map obtained from the data cube of m31 .",
    "only a region within a radius of @xmath61 from the black hole was modeled because the effect of the self - gravity of the stellar populations could be considerable at farther areas .",
    "the parameters of the best model obtained are shown in table  [ tbl1 ] and the final mass obtained for the central black hole ( including the uncertainty introduced by the neglect of the stellar mass in the modeling ) is @xmath62 .",
    "we will show the details about this topic in r. b. menezes et al .",
    "( 2013 , in preparation ) , since the stellar kinematics analysis is not the purpose of this letter .",
    "the mass of the central black hole in m31 we obtained by modeling the kinematics of the h@xmath0 emission as a simple eccentric disk ( @xmath60 ) is within the range of the values found in previous determinations using stellar kinematics ( @xmath63 in @xcite ; @xmath64 in @xcite ; @xmath65 in @xcite ; @xmath66 in @xcite ; @xmath67 in @xcite ; @xmath68 in @xcite ) and it is compatible ( at 1@xmath2 level ) with the measurement ( @xmath69 ) obtained with the most detailed models of the stellar disk elaborated so far @xcite .",
    "this result is also compatible ( at 1@xmath2 level ) with the value of the mass of the central black hole obtained by modeling the stellar kinematics as a simple eccentric disk ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "most of the recent models used to reproduce the stellar disk around the black hole in m31 did not use a single inclination and eccentricity for the entire disk . however , the values we obtained for @xmath36 and @xmath37 in our best models are in the range of the ones used in several studies to model the stellar disk ( @xmath70 for the eccentricity and @xmath71 for the inclination ) @xcite",
    ".    the values of @xmath37 and @xmath36 obtained for the stellar and the h@xmath0 emitting disks with our models are compatible at 1@xmath2 level .",
    "this reveals a certain similarity between these two models .",
    "however , the values of @xmath35 obtained are not compatible at all .",
    "this suggests that the stellar and the h@xmath0 emitting disks are intrinsically different from each other . according to what was mentioned before ,",
    "we have identified a weaker h@xmath25 emission line and also traces of even weaker nebular lines , like [ n ii ] @xmath72 , [ s ii ] @xmath73 , and [ o iii]@xmath30 ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) , along the fov of the residual data cube of m31 .",
    "this , together with the intrinsic difference between the stellar and the h@xmath0 emitting disks , suggests that the h@xmath0 emission is associated with a gaseous disk .",
    "however , we can not exclude the possibility that this emission is , at least in part , originated by stars .",
    "the discovery of an h@xmath0 emitting disk in the nucleus of m31 , reported here , allows an independent measurement of the mass of the central black hole in m31 , and , therefore , has a considerable importance for the studies of this object .",
