    "several states of matter are characterized by a non trivial free energy landscape ( fel ) , which can be at the origin of peculiar structural and dynamical features .",
    "supercooled liquids , glasses , atomic clusters and biomolecules @xcite are typical examples of systems whose thermodynamical behavior can be traced back to the intricate topological properties of the underlying fel .",
    "the pioneering work by stillinger and weber on inherent structures ( iss ) of liquids @xcite revealed the importance of investigating the stationary points of the potential energy surface ( pes ) for characterizing their dynamical and thermodynamical properties .",
    "similar approaches have been proposed and successfully applied , in glasses  @xcite and supercooled liquids  @xcite , to the identification of the structural  arrest temperature .",
    "this temperature marks a topological transition from a dynamics evolving in a landscape dominated by minima to one where unstable saddles play a major role  @xcite .",
    "more recently , this kind of analysis has been applied to the study of protein models @xcite .",
    "in particular , several studies have been devoted to the reconstruction of the pes and of the fel topology in terms of graphs ( at various levels of coarse graining ) connecting the folded states to the unfolded structures  @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the graph structure connecting the various metastable states and of the probability transitions among them allows for a reconstruction of the folding dynamics in terms of a master equation  @xcite .",
    "moreover , detailed analysis of the thermodynamical and dynamical features , characteristics of proteins , have been quite recently carried out in terms of iss @xcite .",
    "these analysis suggest that the folding process of a protein towards its native configuration depends crucially on the structure and topological properties of its ( free ) energy landscape .",
    "confirming somehow the conjecture that the fel of a protein has a funnel  like shape : the native configuration being located inside the so  called native valley at the bottom of the funnel itself @xcite .    on the other hand , mechanical unfolding of single biomolecules represents a powerful technique to extract information on their internal structure as well as on their unfolding and refolding pathways @xcite .",
    "however , mechanical unfolding of biomolecules is an out - of - equilibrium process : unfolding events occur on time scales much shorter than the typical relaxation time of the molecule towards equilibrium .",
    "nonetheless , by using the equality introduced by jarzynski @xcite , the free energy of mechanically manipulated biomolecules can be recovered as a function of an externally controlled parameter @xcite .",
    "moreover , an extended version of the jarzynski equality ( eje ) has been proposed in order to estimate the equilibrium free energy landscape in absence of applied forces as a function of an internal coordinate of the system ( usually , the end - to - end distance @xmath0 )  @xcite .",
    "quite recently this approach has been successfully applied to data obtained from nanomanipulation of titin i27 domain with atomic force microscopy ( afm )  @xcite and from steered molecular dynamics simulations of a mesoscopic off - lattice protein model @xcite .",
    "the analysis reported in @xcite was devoted to a single sequence previously identified as a reasonably fast folder @xcite and it was essentially performed at an unique temperature .    as an extension of the analysis performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the present paper we reconstruct , for two different sequences with bad and good folding properties , the equilibrium fel as a function of the end - to - end distance @xmath0 in two distinct ways : namely , by employing the eje approach and the is distributions .",
    "we will show that specific features of the landscapes characteristic of a protein , i.e. a good folder , can be singled out from a comparison of the two approaches .",
    "furthermore , the different unfolding structural transitions can be associated to the detachment of specific strands of the examined heteropolymers . in particular",
    ", the investigation of the is distributions allows us to give an estimate of the energetic and entropic barriers separating the native state from the completely stretched configuration .",
    "moreover , for the good folder the temperature dependence of the free energy barrier heights and the unfolding times can be related .    an important aspect to clarify is the relationship between the thermal and mechanical unfolding pathways of proteins : experimental @xcite as well as numerical works @xcite seem to suggest that these paths are indeed different .",
    "however , there are indications that the thermal paths can be recovered also via the manipulation procedure in the limit of very low pulling velocities  @xcite .",
    "this seems to be in agreement with our findings for the good folder , which indicate that the observed structural transitions , induced by mechanical unfolding , can be put in direct relationship with the thermal transitions usually identified for the folding / unfolding process .",

    "these values are in reasonably good agreement with those previously obtained from the eje reconstruction , apart at st3 and st4 , where the analysis performed in sect.[six]b indicates entropic barriers to overcome corresponding to @xmath195 and @xmath196 , respectively .",

    "up to the temperatures @xmath202 , average , minimal and maximal @xmath0-values almost coincide indicating that the protein is still confined around the nc , please remember that for the bf @xmath203 .",

    "moreover , the eje reconstructions of the free energy profile compare quite well with the other two approaches for sufficiently low pulling velocities . for the good folder ,",
    "the quality of the free energy landscape reconstruction via the extended jarzinsky equality can be well appreciated by stressing that from pure structural information about the landscape a good estimate of dynamical quantities , like the unfolding times from the native configuration , can be obtained .    furthermore , for the good folder the information obtained by the equilibrium fel both with the eje and the is methodologies can be usefully combined to give substantiated hints about the thermal unfolding . in particular the investigation of the iss",
    "allows us to give an estimate of the ( free ) energetic and entropic barriers separating the native state from the completely stretched configuration .",
    "these barriers are associated to the structural transition induced by the protein manipulation and for the good folder they can put in direct relationship with the thermal transitions usually identified during folding / unfolding processes .",
    "on the other hand for the bad folder the end - to - end distance appears not to represent a good reaction coordinate , since mechanical and thermal unfolding seem to follow different paths .",
    "in other terms the unfolding process for the good folder consists of many small successive rearrangements of the nc , which are well captured by the distribution of the corresponding iss on the landscape . while for the bad folder the thermal unfolding can involve also large conformational rearrangements , thus implying jumps from one valley to another of the landscape associated to large variations in the end - to - end distance",

    "future work on more realistic heteropolymer models is needed to clarify if the observed features , distinguishing good folders from bad folders , can be really considered as a specific trademark of proteins .",
    "a drawback of the eje reconstruction is that extremely small velocities or an extremely large number of repetitions of the protocol are needed to achieve the collapse towards the equilibrium profile , thus rendering the implementation of the method quite time consuming .",

    "@xcite , where it has been shown for a fibronectin domain that pure states can be put in direct correspondence with unfolding intermediates observable during mechanical pulling . however , in the present paper we have been only interested in how the fel , which is the only thermodynamical relevant function , together with the corresponding pure states , can be obtained by employing a suitably chosen ensemble of iss .",
