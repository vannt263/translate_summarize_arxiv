    "whether a nucleon bound in a nuclear medium ( precisely speaking , a bound `` nucleon '' is a quasiparticle which has the same quantum numbers as those of the nucleon ) would alter its properties from those of a free nucleon is of fundamental interest in nuclear physics@xcite .",
    "it is a traditional approach that nucleonic ( and mesonic ) degrees of freedom play an essential role in describing nuclei , but it is also true that those nucleons themselves have substructure .",
    "the idea of employing quark degrees of freedom to describe certain aspects of nuclear structure was motivated in part by the discovery of the emc effect , namely , the discovery that the structure functions of the nucleon [ as measured in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) ] depend on the nucleus in which the nucleon is bound@xcite .",
    "it has been widely accepted that dis is well described by quark and gluon dynamics , i.e. , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to expect that quarks inside a nucleus may play important roles in some contexts , and their wave functions could be strongly modified by the surrounding nuclear environment .",
    "there is strong evidence for a reduction of the effective nucleon mass in the nuclear medium . in quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd)@xcite and",
    "the quark - meson coupling model ( qmc)@xcite , the effective mass of nucleon at normal nuclear density , in mean - field approximation ( mfa ) , is respectively predicted to be roughly 4050% and 2030% smaller than the value in free space .",
    "the mechanism for this reduction is the interaction of the nucleon with the mean scalar field .",
    "qcd sum rules independently lead to a similar prediction from an apparently different mechanism , i.e. , the reduction of the quark condensate as the density increases@xcite .",
    "in contrast , whether the size of the nucleon changes and by how much , are relatively less clear",
    ". the validity of brown - rho scaling@xcite for the nucleon radius could be much more questionable than it is for hadron masses .",
    "the successes of qhd leave little doubt that relativistic nuclear phenomenology is essential in describing the bulk properties of nuclear matter as well as the properties of finite nuclei .",
    "a compelling feature of relativistic mean - field theory has been the reproduction of spin - orbit splittings in finite nuclei and the description of spin observables in nucleon ",
    "nucleus scattering , after calibrating the model parameters by the equilibrium properties of symmetric nuclear matter ( at normal nuclear density ) .",
    "these successful results could be ascribed to the reduction of the effective mass of the nucleon@xcite .    to incorporate the composite nature of the nucleon without losing the successful phenomenology of qhd , guichon proposed a simple hybrid model@xcite ( the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model ) in which nuclear matter is described by non - overlapping , mit bag nucleons@xcite . by analogy with qhd",
    ", qmc describes the bulk properties of nuclear systems using scalar @xmath1 and vector @xmath2 meson mean fields",
    ". however , the nucleon bound in nuclear medium here is no longer a point particle , it has substructure  quarks confined inside the nucleon bag .",
    "it is the quark , rather than the nucleon itself , that is coupled to the @xmath3 and @xmath4 fields directly . as a result ,",
    "the internal structure of the bound nucleon is modified by the surrounding medium with respect to that in free space .",
    "the relative simplicity of the qmc model at the hadronic level , together with its phenomenological successes , makes it suitable for many applications in nuclear physics@xcite .",
    "there are similar models which use the harmonic oscillator@xcite or the color dielectric model@xcite instead of the mit bag for the nucleon .    within qmc",
    ", the small mass of the quark implies that the lower component of the quark wave function will be enhanced rapidly by the change of its environment ( as the @xmath3 field strength increases ) , with a consequent decrease in the scalar baryon density .",
    "as the scalar baryon density itself is the source of the @xmath3 field , this provides a mechanism for the saturation of nuclear matter where the quark substructure plays a vital role .",
    "the extra degrees of freedom , corresponding to the internal structure of the nucleon , lead to a reasonable value for the nuclear incompressibilty , once the corresponding quark and meson coupling constants , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , are determined to reproduce the empirical values for the saturation density and binding energy of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "one drawback in this approach is that the effective scalar and vector fields are significantly reduced , which in turn leads to somewhat insufficient spin - orbit interaction in finite nuclei ( within mfa)@xcite .",
    "with this difficulty in mind , jin and jennings postulated that the bag constant ( @xmath7 ) might decrease along with a reduction of the effective nucleon mass ( @xmath8)@xcite . in their model , the bag constant had to be reduced dramatically ( approximately 35% at normal nuclear density ) to achieve `` the large and cancelling scalar and vector potentials '' which arise in qhd and lead to the large nuclear spin - orbit forces .",
    "one undesirable side effect is that the nuclear incompressbility once again tends to be overpredicted ( one of the original successes of guichon s model was that it generated a reasonable value for the incompressibility ) .",
    "in addition , the nucleon size was found to increase unpleasantly because of the reduction of the bag constant .",
    "( for a recent study , see also ref.@xcite . )    on the other hand , there are already strong , experimental constraints on the extent of such changes of nucleon size@xcite . furthermore , new quasi - elastic @xmath9 and @xmath10 experiments at facilities such as mainz , mit - bates and especially tjnaf should improve these constraints in the near future .    in this paper",
    "we examine this issue , namely , how much the bag constant can be allowed to decrease in nuclear matter given those experimental constraints . for this purpose , we first solve self - consistently the equations of motion for the quarks and mesons in the modified qmc models@xcite .",
    "then we apply the solutions obtained to calculate the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon in medium . from these calculated form factors ,",
    "we extract the root - mean - square ( r.m.s . )",
    "magnetic- and electric- radii . by comparing these with the experimental data for the change of the nucleon size@xcite we can constrain the reduction of the bag constant . for simplicity ,",
    "possible off - shell effects of the bound nucleon in medium@xcite are neglected in the present treatment , but should be added in future , more elaborate studies . however , since each nucleon bag contains three valence quarks in the ground state which move independently under the spherical cavity approximation to the mit bag@xcite , the spurious center - of - mass motion has to be removed . in this study",
    ", we use the peierls - thouless ( pt ) projection method combined with a lorentz contraction for the nucleon internal wave function , as in ref .",
    "this technique for implementing the center - of - mass and recoil corrections has been quite successful in the case of the electromagnetic form factors of nucleon in free space@xcite .    in conventional nuclear physics ,",
    "the nucleon is immutable and the electromagnetic properties of a nucleus are often described by a combination of individual nucleon contributions and various meson exchange current ( mec ) corrections .",
    "although we believe that the two body meson exchange is small in the present case , a full calculation of a nuclear form factor requires a consistent treatment of all mec corrections . since we will ignore the explicit mec corrections here for simplicity , our results should be viewed as somewhat tentative with a need for future elaboration .    in section",

    "we first review the standard treatment of the qmc model  @xcite , which does not allow for any variation of the bag constant , @xmath7 , in the nuclear medium .    in qmc , nuclear matter is described in terms of non - overlapping mit bags , and the quarks inside the bags interact directly with the scalar and vector meson fields , where , the motion of the quarks is highly relativistic and typically they move much faster than the nucleon in the medium ( the fermi motion of the nucleon ) . thus it is reasonable to assume that the quarks always have sufficient time to adjust their motion as the nucleon responds to the medium it is in so that they stay in the lowest energy state@xcite . in the instantaneous rest frame of a nucleon in symmetric nuclear matter ( where the @xmath12 meson mean - field will vanish )",

    "the quantities , @xmath43 and @xmath15 , are determined simultaneously by requiring the free nucleon mass to be @xmath44 mev and by the stability condition , eq.([equil ] ) , for a given bag radius , @xmath45 , in free space ( treated as an input parameter ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the self - consistency condition in qmc is identical to that in qhd , except that in qhd one has @xmath46 @xcite , which corresponds to a point - like nucleon .",
    "all information on the internal structure of the nucleon is contained in @xmath37 .",
    "equivalently , the equation for the mean field , @xmath11 , can also be derived by the thermodynamic condition @xmath47 , where the total energy per nucleon , @xmath48 , for symmetric nuclear matter is given by @xmath49    in the following , we will consider the modified qmc model which was proposed by jin and jennings@xcite , and includes the effect of the reduction in the bag constant , @xmath7 , ( instead of a fixed value , @xmath15 ) in the nuclear medium .",
    "the main difference of the approach used in the present work from that of jin and jennings@xcite ( see also fleck et al .",
    "@xcite and our earlier work ) is that we do not compensate for the spurious center - of - mass motion by subtracting the average value of the momentum squared of the three quarks .",
    "it has been shown that this subtraction , which gives a strong field dependence , would cause significant reduction of the vector potential .",
    "actual calculations using a relativistic oscillator in an external field , where the spurious center - of - mass motion can be removed exactly , show that this field dependence is quite small and thus the simple subtraction procedure is now believed to be inappropriate@xcite .",
    "when a nucleon is put into the nuclear medium , the bag as a whole reacts to the new environment , thus both @xmath43 and @xmath7 may be modified somehow .",
    "there has been some consideration of how @xmath43 might vary depending on the type of baryons@xcite and on the density@xcite .",
    "however , in the present work , we assume that @xmath43 is a fixed constant . in the mit bag ,",
    "the bag constant , @xmath15 , is introduced to satisfy energy - momentum conservation and provides the necessary pressure to confine the quarks .",

    ", the bag constant term contributes approximately @xmath52 mev to the nucleon energy .",
    "however , it is expected to be reduced at finite density and temperature . at a sufficiently high density ,",
    "once nucleons overlap severely , the whole concept of the bag is probably no longer realistic .",
    "one would expect that deconfinement of quarks could occur , and the bag pressure might eventually become zero@xcite",
    ". then one can expect that a decrease of the bag pressure should lead to a larger bag radius and hence larger r.m.s . electromagnetic radii . on the other hand ,",
    "these have been constrained by experiment  @xcite .    in our previous work@xcite",
    "we kept @xmath43 and @xmath15 fixed and used eq .",

    "typically the quark r.m.s .",
    "radius , @xmath53 , calculated by the bag wave function is slightly increased , although the bag radius , @xmath26 , typically decreases by a few percent at normal nuclear density .",
    "the extent of nucleon swelling in qmc , with a constant value for the bag pressure , @xmath15 , has been shown to be consistent with the experimental constraints@xcite .",
    "two models for the reduction in the bag constant , motivated by the work of jin and jennings@xcite , are examined in the following . in the direct coupling model ,",
    "the bag constant is related to the mean scalar field , through @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are real , positive parameters .",

    "note that the standard treatment of the qmc model can be recovered in the limits , @xmath62 , for the direct coupling model and , @xmath63 , for the scaling model .",
    "because of the additional @xmath11 dependence arising in eq.([mass ] ) , through @xmath64 , the self - consistency condition for the scalar field has to be modified . by a straightforward evaluation",
    ", we may replace the quantity , @xmath37 , in eq.([scc ] ) by , @xmath65 for the direct coupling model , and @xmath66 for the scaling model .",
    "clearly both models give rise to a smaller bag constant .",
    "the values for both quantities , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , decrease as the density ( the value of the @xmath11 ) increases , which is a similar feature to that of the standard qmc model .",
    "the evidence concerning a possible nucleon size change in the nuclear medium comes largely from lepton - nucleus scattering , in particular , from quasielastic electron - nucleus scattering . at energy and momentum transfers of several hundred mev ,",

    "might be expected to decrease slightly due to the enhancement of the lower component of the quark wave function , but we shall ignore this small density dependence in the present study and use the approximate relation , @xmath158 , for simplicity .",
    "in the previous standard ( i.e. , `` constant @xmath15 '' ) qmc models , typical solutions show that the values of the scalar mean field are quite large  the term @xmath159 is of the order of 100 mev at normal nuclear density , and thus the final results are insensitive to the values used for the current quark mass , @xmath14  @xcite . later variations introduced some density dependence of the bag constant , @xmath7 , through a parametrized , phenomenological form ( static parameter @xmath55 and @xmath56 or @xmath61)@xcite .",
    "thus for a given bag radius ( input for free nucleon ) , there are two truly dynamical free parameters , the quark and meson coupling constants , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which are adjusted to reproduce the saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the effective nucleon mass , the bag radius in matter , and the value for the scalar mean field are all determined by the equations of motion , whereas the mean field of the vector meson is directly related to the baryon density ( see also eqs.([omega ] )  ( [ equil ] ) ) .",
    "a typical set of parameters and the value of the nuclear incompressibility , @xmath160 , obtained for each model  direct coupling models i and ii ( dc - i and dc - ii ) , the scaling model ( scale ) and the standard qmc  are listed in table  [ qmc ] .",
    "the properties of these self - consistent solutions as a function of the nuclear density ( in units of normal nuclear matter density , @xmath161 @xmath162 ) , are shown in figs .",
    "[ mass.ps][bagconst.ps ] , where the bag radius in free space is taken to be 0.8 fm . for a study of the ( rather weak ) dependence of the final results on the values chosen",

    "the density dependence of the effective nucleon mass is more or less similar for all the qmc type models considered in this study , and the reduction of the mass is very moderate compared with that of qhd .",
    "however , the qmc type models among themselves show a quite different density dependence of the quark r.m.s . radius , @xmath53 .    in fig .",
    "[ saturat.ps ] , we show the energy per nucleon ( with respect to the free nucleon mass , @xmath165 ) calculated for each model , together with the the value of the nuclear incompressibility , @xmath160 .",
    "the parameters in each model are fitted to reproduce the energy at the saturation point , @xmath166 mev .",
    "all the qmc type models reproduce reasonable values ( @xmath167 mev ) for the nuclear incompressibility , @xmath160 ( for the parameter sets listed in table  [ qmc ] ) .",
    "as is well known , the value calculated in a naive version of the qhd model is too large , and thus , the energy per nucleon grows more rapidly than those of the qmc type models as the density increases .",
    "we also show the density dependence of the bag constant , @xmath7 , and bag radius , @xmath26 , in fig .",
    "[ bagconst.ps ] .",
    "although the bag radius calculated for the standard qmc model decreases slightly as the density increases , the increase of the bag radius calculated for the modified qmc models is very pronounced .",
    "as expected , a large reduction of the bag constant causes a large increase of the bag radius .",
    "the quality of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors in free space has been described in our previous publication@xcite .",
    "the corrections for the center - of - mass motion and lorentz contraction lead to a significant improvement over earlier static bag model calculations , in particular , at moderate momentum transfers .",
    "the pionic correction tends to soften the both form factors , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and thus increase the corresponding electromagnetic r.m.s .",

    "( the corresponding quantities in free space will be denoted by @xmath170 and @xmath171 , respectively . )",
    "we also note that the size of these corrections is larger when smaller values of the bag radius in free space are chosen .    as in our previous study@xcite ,",
    "the charge form factors are much more sensitive to the nuclear medium than the magnetic ones .",
    "the variation of the magnetic form factors with respect to their free space counterparts is nearly one order of magnitude smaller than that for the charge form factors . as for the density dependence of the electromagnetic form factors , they are clearly suppressed at small @xmath117 ,",
    "relative to those in free space .",
    "this indicates that the electromagnetic radii of the bound nucleon have increased . in other words ,",
    "the nucleon becomes `` swollen '' once it is put into the nuclear medium . for a fixed @xmath117 ( less than @xmath172 ) ,",
    "the form factors decrease almost linearly with the increase in the nuclear density . at @xmath173 ,",
    "the proton and neutron charge form factors are reduced by roughly 5% and 6% at @xmath174 , and 8% at normal nuclear density , @xmath161 @xmath162 .",
    "similarly , the proton and neutron magnetic form factors are 1% and 0.6% smaller at @xmath174 , and 1.5% and 0.9% at normal nuclear density .",
    "as explained earlier , the best experimental constraints on the changes in these electromagnetic form factors come from the analysis of @xmath0-scaling data . in the kinematic range normally covered by this analysis , the electron - nucleon scattering cross section is predominantly magnetic , so that the limit extracted applies essentially to @xmath175 .",
    "for example , in fe it was concluded by sick that the nucleon r.m.s .",
    "radius can not vary by more than 3%@xcite . for the standard qmc model , with a fixed bag constant ,",
    "the calculated increase in the r.m.s .",
    "radius of the magnetic form factors is less than 0.8% at @xmath176 .",
    "this is well within the experimental limit . for the modified qmc models ( with smaller @xmath7 ) , however , the variation of the r.m.s .",
    "radius can be much stronger .    in tables  [ b0.8][scale1.0 ] , we show the changes of the electromagnetic r.m.s .",

    "two values of the bag radius in free space are used in this calculation . in the direct coupling model ,",
    "we take the limit , @xmath178 , and vary @xmath55 . for each selected model ( fixed @xmath55 or @xmath61 ) ,",
    "the coupling constants , @xmath179 and @xmath180 , are first determined by fitting the saturation properties of nuclear matter at normal nuclear density .",
    "the mean fields , quark frequency , and effective nucleon mass are then subsequently solved self - consistently for other nuclear densities .",
    "the current quark mass is taken to be zero .",
    "it is clear from the tables that the bag constant and the electromagnetic r.m.s .",
    "radii are strongly correlated .",
    "a smaller bag constant will lead to a larger size of the bound nucleon .    for finite nuclei",
    ", it is well known that a large portion of the nucleons are distributed near the nuclear surface .",
    "the experimental constraints thus correspond to the quantities at the average nuclear density , which we take to be about @xmath181 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are @xmath182 , @xmath181 and @xmath181 , respectively . ] .",
    "[ rms.ps ] shows the correlation between the bag constant and the magnetic radius of the proton at a nuclear density @xmath183 . for an increase of about 3% in the magnetic radius ( @xmath184 ) , which is the upper limit allowed from the @xmath0-scaling data , the bag constant",
    "is allowed to decrease by about 8% for the direct coupling model and 16% for the scaling model , with the bare bag radius , @xmath185 fm .",
    "these reductions become 12% and 18% with a smaller bag radius , @xmath186 fm .",
    "the possible reduction of the bag constant , @xmath7 , might also be extracted from the electric form factors if we had a reliable experimental constraint for the charge radius . in the @xmath0-scaling analysis ,",
    "since the electric and magnetic form factors contribute typically in the ratio 1:3 in the kinematic regime selected , the corresponding limit on @xmath187 would be nearly 10% .",
    "for the electric form factors the best experimental limit seems to come from the coulomb sum - rule , where a variation bigger than 4% would be excluded@xcite . with this strong limit , the bag constant",
    "is allowed to be reduced by roughly 10% in the scaling model and is almost unchangeable in the direct - coupling model .",
    "in summary , the bag constant in the nuclear medium , as a crude representation of the very complicated qcd mechanism of confinement , may be expected to decrease .",
    "we have examined the possible variations of the bag constant in two modified versions of the qmc model .",
    "the parameters are determined to reproduce the empirical values for the bulk properties of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "we have calculated the density dependence of the electromagnetic form factors of the bound nucleon in the medium , then compared the corresponding r.m.s .",
    "radii with the best available @xmath0-scaling analysis for quasielastic electron - nucleus scattering . since the change in the size of the nucleon is strongly limited by these @xmath0-scaling data",
    ", so is the bag constant .",
    "our results show that the bag constant in medium , @xmath7 , is allowed to decline by only 1017% at the typical average nuclear density of about @xmath181 should be less than 1.2 in the direct coupling model with @xmath58 ( c.f . eq .",
    "( [ b1 ] ) ) and @xmath61 less than 1.2 in the scaling model ( c.f .",
    "( [ b2 ] ) ) . ] .",
    "this limit would be reduced by a further 7% at normal nuclear density .",
    "this is a considerably smaller change than most of the cases studied by jin and jennings@xcite , but comparable with the usual estimates of the change in the gluon condensate@xcite , or of the bag constant itself@xcite in nuclear matter .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the pion cloud of the nucleon plays an important role in calculating the electromagnetic form factors . without the pion cloud , the nucleon r.m.s .",
    "radius tends to be somewhat small , for a reasonable bag radius .",
    "thus the relative variation is much more sensitive to the bag constant .",
    "typically , @xmath188 without the pionic correction is three times larger than that with the pion field .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the mec effects which can be important in conventional nuclear physics have not been included in the present study .",
    "this should be reasonable in a first treatment because mec corrections are not very important near the quasielastic peak and they contribute primarily to the behaviour of the nucleon momentum distribution , rather than to a change of the effective electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon .",
    "further improvements rely on a better treatment of the qmc model and require the explicit inclusion of nucleon - nucleon correlations and medium polarization effects",
