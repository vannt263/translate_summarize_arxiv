    "the discovery that at the heart of virtually all early - type galaxies in the local universe , lie supermassive nuclear black holes ( sbhs ) has led to the general consensus that black holes play a pivotal role in the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "the well - known correlation between the black hole mass , m@xmath7 , and the host galaxy s stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath8 ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) implies that black hole growth and the build - up of galaxy bulges go hand - in - hand , perhaps as feedback from the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) regulates the surrounding star formation in the host galaxy ( e.g. silk & rees 1998 ; kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) .",
    "the connection between black hole growth and galaxy bulges is further intimated by the fact that virtually all _ currently _ known actively accreting black holes i.e. agn - in the local universe are found in galaxies with prominent bulges ( e.g. heckman 1980a ; ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997 ; kauffmann et al .",
    "it is unclear how common it is for bulgeless galaxies to contain sbhs and of those that do , whether they are actively accreting .",
    "m33 , the best studied nearby bulgeless galaxy , shows no evidence of a sbh and the upper limit on the mass is significantly below that predicted by the m@xmath7-@xmath8 relation established in early - type galaxies ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2001 ; merritt et al .",
    "2001 ) .    amongst the population of known agn , there are possibly a handful of extremely late - type galaxies that may show subtle signs of agn activity in their optical narrow - line nuclear spectra ( ho et al .",
    "the best - studied definitive case of an agn in a purely bulgeless galaxy is the galaxy ngc 4395 , which shows an unmistakable seyfert 1 spectrum .",
    "the inferred black hole mass in this dwarf galaxy is 3.6 @xmath2 10@xmath9 m@xmath6 ( peterson et al .",
    "2005 ) , much less massive than black holes found in galaxies with massive bulges , and comparable to the inferred black hole mass in the other well - know dwarf galaxy with an agn , pox 52 ( barth et al .",
    "greene & ho ( 2004 ) recently searched the first data release of the sloan digital sky survey for galaxies with similar intermediate mass black holes and found only 19 broad - line agn , suggesting that they are uncommon .",
    "subsequent stellar velocity dispersion measurements revealed that these objects follow the extrapolation of the m@xmath7-@xmath8 relation ( barth et al .",
    "it is unclear if the hosts are late - type galaxies since the sloan images are of insufficient spatial resolution to confirm their morphological type .",
    "are agn uncommon in bulgeless galaxies ? is a bulge necessary for a black hole to form and grow ?",
    "these questions can not be definitively answered with the current suite of observations , which are largely carried out at optical wavelengths .",
    "such studies can be severely limited in the study of bulgeless galaxies , where a putative agn is likely to be both energetically weak and deeply embedded in the center of a dusty late - type spiral .",
    "in such systems , the traditional optical emission lines used to identify agn can be dominated by emission from star formation regions , in addition to being significantly attenuated by dust in the host galaxy .",
    "indeed searching for agn under these circumstances poses unique challenges . although x - ray observations can be a powerful tool in finding optically obscured agn in the non - compton - thick regime , the x - ray luminosities of weak agn will be low and comparable to and therefore indistinguishable from x - ray binaries in the host galaxy .",
    "similarly , the radio emission can be dominated by and indistinguishable from compact nuclear starbursts ( e.g. , condon et al . , 1991 ) .",
    "_ spitzer _ mid - ir spectroscopy is the ideal tool to search for agn in such galaxies .",
    "as has been shown in previous works , agn show prominent high excitation fine structure line emission but starburst and normal galaxies are characterized by a lower excitation spectra characteristic of hii regions ionized by young stars ( e.g. , genzel et al .",
    "1998 ; sturm et al . 2002 ; satyapal et al . 2004 ) .",
    "in particular , the [ nev ] 14 @xmath0 m ( ionization potential 96 ev ) line is not produced in hii regions surrounding young stars , the dominant energy source in starburst galaxies , since even hot massive stars emit very few photons with energy sufficient for the production of this ion .",
    "the detection of this line in a galaxy is therefore definitive proof of an agn .    in this _ letter _ , we report the discovery of an agn in the galaxy ngc 3621 .",
    "ngc 3621 is a relatively isolated nearby ( 6.2 mpc ; rawson et al .",
    "1997 ) sad iii - iv ( third reference catalogue of bright galaxies rc3 ; de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) galaxy with no previous published evidence for nuclear activity .",
    "the observations presented here add to the growing evidence that a black hole can form and grow in a galaxy with little or no bulge .",
    "ngc 3621 was observed by the infrared spectrometer ( houck et al .",
    "2004 ) on board _",
    "spitzer _ using the short - wavelength high - resolution ( sh ; 4.7@xmath211.3 , 9.9 - 19.6 @xmath0 m ) and the long - wavelength high - resolution ( lh ; 11.1@xmath222.3 , 18.7 - 37.2 @xmath0 m ) modules as part of the sings legacy proposal ( program i d 159 ; kennicutt et al .",
    "2003 ) on 2004 june 28 .",
    "these modules have a spectral resolution of r @xmath1 600 .",
    "the observations were executed in spectral mapping mode , in which the spacecraft moves in a raster pattern of discrete steps in order to construct a rectangular map of the targeted region .",
    "the sh and lh maps included 3 pointings parallel to and 5 pointings perpendicular to the major axis of the slit , with half slit - length and half - slit width steps , respectively .",
    "the integration time per pointing was approximately 60s , with each position being covered twice for the sh observations .",
    "the total duration for the high resolution observations of ngc 3621 was 2915s .",
    "we used bcd - level data products downloaded from the _ spitzer _ archive in conjunction with _",
    "_ v.1.0.2 ( kennicutt et al . 2003 ; smith et al . 2004 ) to construct the high - resolution spectral cubes for ngc  3621 .",

    "the final full cube map size for sh corresponds to @xmath124.7@xmath213.5 , while the final full cube map size for lh corresponds to @xmath144.6@xmath230.8 . at the distance of ngc 3621",
    ", this corresponds to a physical size of 742pc@xmath2405pc and 1341pc@xmath2923pc .",
    "given the small spatial extent of both the sh and lh maps , we were unable to perform in - situ background subtraction , since the full extent of each map is confined within the galaxy .",
    "the post - bcd software smart , v.5.5.7 ( higdon et al . , 2004 ) , was then used to obtain line fluxes from the extracted 1d spectra .",
    "when line ratios were calculated , the line flux was obtained from spectra extracted from the same - sized aperture in both modules corresponding to the same physical region on the galaxy .",
    "this aperture can range from a minimum of @xmath1 9@xmath29 , below which artifacts introduced by an undersampled psf can distort the spectrum , to a maximum of 22.6@xmath214.8  ",
    "i.e. , roughly the full extent of the sh map .",
    "the fits output images from _ cubism _ were smoothed within _",
    "ds9 _ using a gaussian kernel of 2-pixel width .",
    "finally , the line map plots were created using the iraf routine _ rotate _ in conjunction with _",
    "in figure 1 , we show spectra extracted from the full aperture of the sh and lh maps near 14 @xmath0 m , 24 @xmath0 m , and 26@xmath0 m . as can be seen , there are clear detections of the [ nev]14@xmath0 m ( 4@xmath8 ) , [ nev]24@xmath0 m ( 6@xmath8 ) , and the [ oiv ] 25.9@xmath0 m ( 10@xmath8 ) lines , providing strong evidence for the presence of an agn .",
    "continuum - subtracted spectral images reveal that the emission is centrally concentrated and peaks at the position of the nucleus determined from the 2mass coordinates , as can be seen in figure 2 . since the ratio of high to low excitation lines depends on the nature of the ionizing source , the [ nev]14@xmath0m/[neii]12.8@xmath0 m and the [ oiv]25.9@xmath0m/[neii]12.8@xmath0 m line flux ratios have been used to characterize the nature of the dominant ionizing source in galaxies ( e.g. , genzel et al .",

    "the [ nev]/[neii ] ratio for the 13 agn with both [ nev ] and [ neii ] detections by the _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ ranges from 0.06 to 2.11 , with a median value of 0.47 ( sturm et al .",
    "the [ nev]/[neii ] ratio corresponding to the maximum aperture ( 22.6@xmath214.8  ) for this galaxy is 0.06 , similar to the lowest value observed in a similar aperture ( 27@xmath214  ) by _ iso_. the [ nev]/[neii ] ratio does not increase substantially as the aperture size is reduced ; the line ratio corresponding to the minimum aperture ( 9@xmath29  ) is 0.064 .",

    "we note that the fact that the [ nev]/[neii ] and [ oiv]/[neii ] line flux ratios are very low suggests that the _ spitzer _",

    "however , an optical spectrum has been obtained by the sings team which does show a very low - power seyfert , but it becomes inconspicuous for an aperture size of @xmath1 1kpc due to contamination from star formation in the host galaxy ( moustakas et al .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      since there are currently no published optical spectroscopic observations of ngc 3621 , it is not possible to estimate the bolometric luminosity of the agn using traditional optical calibration factors ( e.g. kaspi et al .",

    "there are no previously published high spectral resolution optical observations from which the stellar velocity dispersion in this galaxy can be determined . in the absence of an explicit bulge - disk decomposition from the surface photometry , we can get an order of magnitude estimate of the bulge luminosity using the morphological type of the galaxy and its total luminosity .",
    "we adopt the empirical relation given in simien & de vaucouleurs ( 1986 ) to estimate the contribution of the disk to the total luminosity of a disk galaxy : if 3 @xmath19 t @xmath19 7 : @xmath20 = 0.324(t + 5 )  0.054(t + 5)@xmath21 + 0.0047(t + 5)@xmath5 , where t is the numerical hubble type index , as given in the rc3 .",
    "the bulge absolute magnitudes is then given by : @xmath22(bul ) = @xmath23 + @xmath24 .",

    "the expected black hole mass is m@xmath18= 3.1@xmath210@xmath14 m@xmath6 , approximately three orders of magnitude higher than the lower mass limit derived from the eddington limit .",

    "the maximum rotational velocity has been shown to follow a tight correlation with the stellar velocity dispersion in spiral galaxies in which extended rotation curves are available ( ferrarese 2002 ; baes et al .",

    "our estimate for the bolometric luminosity of the agn is approximately two orders of magnitude greater than that of ngc 4395 ( peterson et al . 2005 ) , the best - studied example of a bulgeless galaxy hosting an agn .",
    "these observations suggests that perhaps it is not the bulge but the dark matter halo of the host galaxy that determines the presence and activity level of sbhs , as suggested by recent theoretical models for the formation of supermassive black holes ( e.g. , adams , graff , & richstone 2001 ; natarajan , sigurdsson , & silk 1998 ) .",

    "are agn in bulgeless galaxies more common than once thought ?",
    "since the optical emission lines in weak agn may be dominated by star formation in the host galaxy , it is possible that agn are missed in optical spectroscopic surveys and that they are perhaps more common than current optical surveys suggest .",
    "moreover , it is well known that the infrared ( ir ) excess observed in galaxies increases along the hubble sequence implying that late - type galaxies are dusty ( e.g. sauvage & thuan 1994 ) . in order to truly determine how common sbhs and agn activity are in bulgeless galaxies and",
