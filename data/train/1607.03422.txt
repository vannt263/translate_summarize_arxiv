    "in the following we consider one - dimensional discrete schrdinger operators .",

    "the associate operator is denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that @xmath0 satisfies some diophantine condition : given @xmath10 , we denote @xmath11 if for every @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , we restrict ourselves to the case of a small analytic potential , i.e. , @xmath14 , and with the notations of @xcite@xmath15 . , we have @xmath16 . ]    since @xmath17 , the spectrum @xmath18 does not depend on the phase @xmath19 .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath20 is a compact subset of @xmath21 .",
    "our study focuses on the spectral gaps of @xmath22 , which by definition are the connected components of the complement of @xmath20 in @xmath21 . to each energy @xmath23",
    "we can associate a cocycle @xmath24 over the irrational translation @xmath25 , called the schrdinger cocycle , and whose dynamics is closely related to the spectral properties of @xmath22 .",
    "indeed , any formal solution to the eigenvalue equation for @xmath22 can be expressed in terms of this cocycle .",
    "a key fact is that the spectrum corresponds to energies @xmath26 for which @xmath24 is _ not _ uniformly hyperbolic .",
    "let @xmath27 be an energy in the spectrum . under the above assumption that @xmath28 , avila and jitomirskaya @xcite have shown that the lyapunov exponent for a definition , and theorem [ theolyapexp ] below for the corresponding statement .",
    "] of @xmath29 vanishes ; in fact , they obtain a better control on the growth of the iterates of the cocycle .",
    "this corresponds to what is usually called the _ subcritical regime _ : for any @xmath30 , there exist @xmath31 , @xmath32 such that for any @xmath33 , @xmath34    since @xmath25 is uniquely ergodic and because schrdinger cocycles are homotopic to the identity , it is possible to introduce a notion of fibered rotation number .",
    "this object allows us to characterize spectral gaps : indeed , an energy @xmath26 belongs to a non - collapsed gap if the rotation number @xmath35 is locally constant around @xmath26 .",
    "moreover each spectral gap can be assigned an integer label @xmath36 , such that the rotation number restricted to the spectral gap satisfies @xmath37 . in the following ,",
    "we denote by @xmath38 the spectral gap labeled by @xmath39 .",
    "reducibility of schrdinger cocycles is a fundamental question .",
    "it asks whether @xmath24 can be conjugated to a constant cocycle ; if so the dynamics becomes much easier to understand since the iterates of the cocycle are conjugated to the powers of a constant matrix .",
    "reducibility gives a lot of information , for instance on the growth of the cocycle , on the existence of absolutely continuous spectrum _ etc .",
    "_ ( see for instance @xcite or @xcite for some examples ) .",
    "avila and krikorian weakened this notion and introduced the concept of almost reducibility : in such a case , it is not necessarily possible to conjugate the cocycle to a constant one , but we can get as close to it as desired .    one important approach to the problem of reducibility is given by kam theory . in this case , we start with the perturbation of a constant cocycle and wonder if the resulting cocycle is still reducible .",
    "the method is based on an iteration process , where at each step the cocycle is conjugated to a new one which is closer to be constant .",
    "each conjugacy is obtained by solving some cohomological equation , and the problem of small divisors is classically one limitation of these techniques .",
    "using such a perturbative approach , ben hadj amor was able to get a subexponential bound on the size of spectral gaps . in our case ,",
    "her results give    assume that @xmath40 .",
    "then there exists a constant @xmath41 that only depends on @xmath42 and @xmath43 such that if @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , then for any @xmath47 , @xmath48 for some constants @xmath49 , and where @xmath50 only depends on @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the main part of her proof consists in showing an almost reducibility result thanks to a kam scheme of faster convergence .",
    "she uses it together with some transversality properties to get a lower bound on the variation of the rotation number on some intervals .",
    "but on a non - collapsed spectral gap , the rotation number is constant , and this thus gives an upper bound on the length of the gap .",
    "one advantage of her methods is that they also work in higher dimensional situations , which is not the case for the approach we develop in the following .",
    "another method to study the reducibility properties of the schrdinger cocycle is given by aubry duality .",
    "it relates the localization properties of a dual schrdinger operator @xmath53 ( the definitions are given in subsection [ almostlocc ] ) to the reducibility of schrdinger cocycles .",
    "more precisely , starting with a generalized solution @xmath54 to the eigenvalue equation for @xmath53 , it is possible to construct a vector @xmath55 , called a bloch wave , which behaves nicely under the dynamics of @xmath56 . using this vector",
    ", we can build a matrix which will conjugate our cocycle to a constant one .",
    "this relation was studied in more detail in @xcite , where avila and jitomirskaya show that a similar link exists between the almost localization properties of @xmath53 and almost reducibility of schrdinger cocycles . under our assumption",
    "that @xmath57 , they prove that dual schrdinger operators are almost localized . in their paper",
    ", the analysis is made in terms of the resonances of a certain phase @xmath19 , and uses truncated bloch waves ; in particular , they show that almost localization implies quantitative almost reducibility results , where both the constant matrix and the conjugacy can be controlled by the resonances of @xmath19",
    ". these estimates were later improved by avila in @xcite .",
    "thanks to these non - perturbative arguments , we obtain exponential decay of the length of spectral gaps with respect to their label .",
    "recall that for @xmath58 , we denote by @xmath38 the associated spectral gap .",
    "our main result is then :    [ tthma ] assume that the frequency @xmath0 is diophantine , i.e.  @xmath59 , that the potential @xmath1 is analytic , and that @xmath60 .",
    "then there exist constants @xmath61 such that for any @xmath47 , @xmath62    we give two proofs of this fact .",
    "the first one proceeds as follows .",
    "given some integer @xmath63 , we start with the energy @xmath64 located on the right boundary of the corresponding spectral gap . following @xcite , we introduce a phase @xmath65 for which we may find a bounded solution to the eigenvalue equation for the dual schrdinger operator .",
    "we will see that @xmath66 for some @xmath67 ; in particular , @xmath19 is non - resonant ( see subsection [ almostlocc ] for the definition ) , and this implies that the corresponding schrdinger cocycle is reducible .",
    "more precisely , it follows from the estimates of @xcite that the cocycle @xmath24 can be conjugated to a constant parabolic cocycle , with off - diagonal coefficient decaying exponentially fast with respect to @xmath68 , and where the conjugacy is subexponentially big . by an idea present in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we can relate these estimates to the label @xmath63 of the spectral gap we consider .",
    "we then use this conjugacy to study the perturbed cocycle @xmath69 for some small @xmath70 .",
    "thanks to an averaging argument similar those which can be found for example in @xcite or @xcite , we then show that we can take @xmath71 exponentially small with respect to @xmath63 such that the rotation number @xmath72 is different from @xmath73 ; this shows that @xmath74 does not lie in the spectral gap anymore , which gives an exponential bound on the size of the latter .    the second proof we give",
    "is based on the monotonicity of schrdinger cocycles with respect to the energy ; indeed , recall that the derivative of the fibered rotation number with respect to @xmath26 is always nonpositive .",
    "the proof also uses the fact that on the boundary of a spectral gap , we can conjugate the schrdinger cocycle to some constant parabolic cocycle with good estimates both on the conjugacy and the off - diagonal coefficient .",
    "monotonicity for the schrdinger cocycle translates through the conjugacy into monotonicity for the conjugate cocycle .",
    "then we see that after an exponentially small perturbation of the energy , we can change the rotation number , which concludes .",
    "let us say a few words on the continuous case , that is , for an operator @xmath75 defined on the real line , where @xmath1 is a quasiperiodic analytic potential . in @xcite ,",

    "assume that there exists @xmath109 such that for any @xmath110 , the lyapunov exponent @xmath111 of @xmath24 satisfies @xmath112 .",

    "setting , homogeneity of the spectrum was studied by damanik , goldstein and lukic @xcite . in this paper",
    "the authors build on the results of damanik and goldstein @xcite recalled above , and prove that under the same assumptions , the spectrum is @xmath2-homogeneous . mimicking the proof given in @xcite , we show :    [ thmmb ] let @xmath116 be a diophantine frequency , @xmath1 an analytic potential and assume that @xmath117 .",

    "in the first part , we recall general facts on quasiperiodic schrdinger operators . the second part is dedicated to the proof of a quantitative reducibility result for schrdinger cocycles associated with energies located on the boundary of a spectral gap . in the third part ,",
    "we explain how this fact together with an averaging argument imply exponential decay of the size of the gaps . in the fourth part",
    ", we give another proof , based on the monotonicity of schrdinger cocycles with respect to the energy . as an application of our main result",
