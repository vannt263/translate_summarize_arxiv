    "the idea that the ground state of qcd at zero temperature and nonzero chemical potential can spontaneously break translation invariance was first suggested by deryagin , grigoriev and rubakov ( drg ) @xcite .",
    "they studied large-@xmath2 qcd at weak coupling , and showed that the four - quark interaction , that is generated by a single gluon exchange , causes an instability in the quark fermi sea toward the creation of a condensate of the form @xmath3 here the wave vector @xmath4 has an arbitrary direction but its modulus is given by the fermi momentum of the quarks @xmath5 this phenomenon is often referred to as chiral density waves , and has famous solid - state counterparts like the one - dimensional peierls instability @xcite , and the spin density wave of the overhauser effect @xcite .",
    "the large-@xmath2 result of @xcite was consequently found to be misleading @xcite , and shuster and son showed in @xcite that if @xmath2 is decreased from infinity to @xmath6 , then color - superconductivity becomes preferable over the dgr state .",
    "nonetheless , the authors in @xcite studied what may happen at lower densities ( for @xmath7 ) , where weak coupling treatments are less reliable @xcite .",
    "the conclusion of @xcite was that chiral density waves may still be competitive with superconductivity , especially when one uses an instanton vertex to couple the quarks .",
    "recently , there has been related progress in the gross - neveu model .",
    "this @xmath8 model can be studied in large-@xmath2 , and its phase structure in the temperature - density plane was known to have a line of first order transitions that separate a low density phase with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry , and a high density phase , where this symmetry is intact .",
    "this structure arises when one restricts to an @xmath9-independent ansatz for @xmath10 and was recently revisited in @xcite ( and later with a lattice regularisation in @xcite ) , where the condensate was allowed to depend on the spatial coordinate of @xmath9 .",
    "the study in @xcite discovered a new phase at low temperatures and high densities , which is separated by a second order phase transition from the low density phase , and where the chiral condensate has a crystalline structure .",
    "this crystal structure was also seen in the  t hooft model @xcite , and is reminiscent of results from older work in the skyrme model @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we look for a phase with chiral density waves using an effective action that is derived from the strong - coupling expansion of lattice qcd .",
    "apart from a phenomenological interest in this model , and in the way it may expose the phase we are after , we are also motivated by the following , more practical , reason .",
    "future monte - carlo simulations of qcd at low temperatures and large chemical potentials , that will manage to control the sign problem , will presumably start by simulating relatively coarse lattices with strong couplings . this makes the knowledge on the phase diagram of the strong - coupling limit important , and in our context it is desirable to know whether one should expect a crystal phase , and if so , at which values of the chemical potential @xmath11 .    indeed , numerous authors have analytically investigated the phase diagram of the strong - coupling limit ( for reviews see @xcite ) , but the possibility to have chiral density waves was never considered , and these works were always restricted to homogeneous field configurations .    here",
    "we relax this constraint for the first time . to do so",
    ", we choose to work with one - component staggered fermions . in four dimensions ,",
    "these lattice fermions describe four degenerate continuum dirac fermions , commonly referred to as tastes .",
    "the continuum theory has an @xmath12 chiral symmetry , that explicitly breaks on the lattice to the following axial taste non - singlet @xmath13 @xmath14 here @xmath15 is a @xmath16 traceless matrix that operates in taste space , and that can be chosen to have the same matrix elements of @xmath17 .",
    "the ground state that we study in this paper is characterised by the helical condensates @xmath18 that spontaneously break the chiral symmetry of as well as translation invariance . note that eqs .",
    "( [ gs1])([gs2 ] ) can not be rotated by a global transformation to have @xmath19 .",
    "this means that if we regard the continuum limit as a theory of four degenerate light quarks , then our chiral waves break @xmath20 flavor . as a result",
    ", we are studying a ground state which is closer to the one studied in @xcite than to the original dgr state , which is a flavor singlet .",
    "the reason we choose this particular type of lattice fermions is that , in the strong - coupling limit , they give rise to a very simple effective action in terms of hadrons .",
    "this action was derived some time ago by hoek , kawamoto , and smit @xcite , and in the next section we re - derive it for self - completeness .",
    "after discussing why it is natural to expect chiral density waves in the ground state of this action ( at nonzero @xmath11 ) , we formulate in section  [ sec : mft ] a mean - field theory that is general enough to allow for such chiral waves to emerge .",
    "the mean - field equations are solved in section  [ sec : mfsol ] , where we also investigate how the mean - field ground state evolves when we increase @xmath11 .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : summary ] with a few remarks on the implications of this work and on future prospects .",
    "appendix  [ sec : baryon_det ] includes technical details related to the calculation of the mean - field equations and the mean - field free energy .",

    "when we move from @xmath104 to @xmath313 the crystalline phase disappears .",

    "this changes if one makes the meson self - interaction @xmath319 stronger by changing it to @xmath320 with @xmath321 .",
    "our aim in this paper was to see whether the phase diagram of strongly - coupled lattice qcd at zero temperature and nonzero density includes an incommensurate crystalline phase with chiral density waves .",
    "to do so we followed hoek , kawamoto , and smit ( hks ) , and used the effective hadronic action , @xmath67 , that they derived in @xcite for one - component staggered fermions .",
    "we formulated a mean - field theory for @xmath67 which is novel in the following ways .",
    "firstly , we do not neglect the terms in @xmath67 that have four and six powers of the meson fields , and treat the baryon contribution in full .",
    "secondly , our mean - field analysis is free of any undetermined parameters and we fix all vacuum expectation values by minimising the free - energy .",
    "lastly , we do not assume a homogeneous ansatz , which is imperative in order to look for the crystalline phase .",
    "this leads us to introduce auxiliary fields without the usual hubbard - stratonovich transformation , that can become ill - defined for inhomogeneous vacua .    despite the fact that the generic structure of @xmath67 can give rise to a crystal phase ( see discussion in section  [ seff_cdw ] ) , we find that this _ does not _ happen with our mean - field ansatz .",
    "this is partly due to lattice artifacts that come in the form of a large lattice baryon mass @xmath322 .",
    "the latter prohibits any possibility to have a gapless baryonic spectrum in the presence of the chiral density waves , which would allow the crystalline vacuum to compete with the massless homogeneous vacuum . to check this explanation ,",
    "we take a formal limit of @xmath67 , where @xmath323 , and indeed find that this lower mass can stabilise the crystal .",
    "more precisely , when we study this formal limit in the @xmath8 system , we see a crystal structure at intermediate densities , with a wave vector given by the fermi momentum of the system .",
    "however , this result is not robust ; when we move to @xmath324 and @xmath325 dimensions we see that the crystalline instability is too weak to survive . the reasons for that include an additional lattice artifact , that does not go away when @xmath0 decreases , and a too weak interaction between the fermions .",
    "our results stress that to get continuum physics from monte - carlo simulations at nonzero @xmath11 and low temperature , one will have to simulate on relatively fine lattices , with weak couplings .",
    "in particular , the baryon mass in lattice units , @xmath0 , should be much smaller than its strong - coupling limit of @xmath1 .",
    "only when this happens will the structure of the baryon energy bands be ` continuum - like ' . for stronger couplings ,",
    "the energy bands are _ qualitatively _ different than the continuum ones , and physical phenomena that are sensitive to their structure will also be _",
    "qualitatively _ different than it is in the continuum .",
    "chiral crystals is an good example for such a phenomenon , that simply goes away at strong couplings .",
    "there are several ways in which one could extend this study .",
    "first , recall that we have focused on an ansatz that breaks translation invariance only in one direction .",
    "this direction was chosen to be along one of the lattice axes , but a further study can generalise this easily ( we have already derived the free energy for a general @xmath326 ) and check whether this makes the crystalline phase more robust .",
    "second , as the authors in @xcite point out , one can lower the energy of the crystalline phase by considering an ansatz which is a linear combination of waves , that will break translation invariance in all directions .",
    "third , it will be useful ( but also hard ) to see how do the sub - leading terms in the strong - coupling expansion influence the results .",
    "these were obtained in @xcite for the fermions we consider here , and give rise to more complicated interactions between the hadrons .",
    "finally , it can be interesting to numerically study the possibility of chiral density waves in the nambu - jona - lasinio model , where monte - carlo simulations are free from the sign - problem .",
