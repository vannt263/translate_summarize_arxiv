    "the recent developments in quantum information have turned entanglement into a concrete physical resource that is important to identify , quantify and classify ( _ e.g. _ see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the techniques devised to this end have spurred the novel use of some mathematical notions like positive linear maps @xcite which had been somewhat neglected in quantum theory ; in fact , fully consistent physical operations have to be described by completely positive maps @xcite .",
    "the need for complete positivity is due to the existence of entangled states : entangled bipartite states , if subjected to positive transformations acting on one partner only , do not in general remain positive and thus lose their probabilistic interpretation ( for recent related work on this issue , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , this very same fact renders positive maps useful in detecting entanglement @xcite .",
    "the simplest instance of positive , but not completely positive map , is the transposition : when acting on one partner only ( partial transposition ) of a bipartite system it detects all entangled states of @xmath1 and @xmath2-dimensional systems . in higher dimension , however , there are bipartite states which remain positive under partial transposition and are nevertheless entangled .",
    "further , the kind of entanglement they contain can not be distilled by local quantum operations and classical communication ( these and other properties are reviewed _",
    "e.g. _ in @xcite ) .",
    "this undistillable entanglement is termed `` bound '' and can be detected only by means of indecomposable positive maps , namely maps that can not be written as the sum of a completely positive map and a completely positive map composed with transposition .",
    "it is thus of practical importance to provide as many examples of indecomposable maps as possible , but the task is rather difficult for , unlike completely positive maps , the structure of positive ones is still elusive @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we add to the phenomenology of positive maps @xcite a class of one - parameter semigroups @xcite arising from the theory of open quantum systems @xcite ; we discuss their decomposability and show how they can be used to detect bound entangled states . in particular , we will be concerned with a class of @xmath3 density matrices naturally arising from a @xmath4 square lattice through the use of tensor products of pauli matrices .",
    "in section 2 , we shortly review some basic notions and results concerning positivity , complete positivity and quantum dynamical semigroups ; in section 3 , we focus on the above mentioned class of lattice states and study which of them remain positive under partial transposition ( ppt ) ; finally , we present some results on the study of their entanglement properties .",
    "we start with some basic facts about positive maps and entanglement in the case of a finite @xmath5-dimensional system @xmath6 .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath7 the algebra of @xmath8 complex matrices and by @xmath9 the space of states ( density matrices ) of @xmath6 , that is the convex set of positive @xmath10 of unit trace .",
    "any hermiticity and trace - preserving linear map @xmath11 can be written as @xcite @xmath12=\\sum_{k , i=0}^{d^2 - 1}\\ , \\lambda_{ki}\\,f_k\\,\\rho\\,f^\\dagger_i\\ , \\ ] ] where the @xmath13 , @xmath14 , are traceless @xmath8 matrices , forming together with the normalized identity @xmath15 an orthonormal set in @xmath7 : @xmath16 , @xmath17 ; the coefficients @xmath18 form a generic hermitian matrix such that @xmath19 .",
    "any linear map @xmath20 that is used to describe a physical state transformation , must preserve the positivity of all states @xmath21 , otherwise the appearance of negative eigenvalues in @xmath22 $ ] would spoil its statistical interpretation , which is based on the use of its eigenvalues as probabilities .",
    "the property of preserving the positivity of the spectrum of all @xmath21 is called positivity ; however , it is not sufficient to make @xmath20 fully physically consistent .",
    "indeed , the system @xmath6 may always be thought to be statistically coupled to an ancilla @xmath23-level system @xmath24 ; one is thus forced to consider the action @xmath25 over the compound system @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the identity action on the ancilla . in order to be fully physically consistent as a state transformation , not only @xmath20 should be positive , but also @xmath25 for all @xmath23 ; such a property is called complete positivity @xcite .",
    "complete positivity is necessary because of the existence of entangled states of the compound system @xmath26 , namely of states that can not be written as factorized linear convex combinations @xmath28 if only separable states as in ( [ sepst ] ) existed , then positivity of @xmath20 would be enough .",
    "we briefly collect below some results concerning positivity and complete positivity that will be used in the following .    in the space of states @xmath29 of the bipartite system @xmath30 ,",
    "let us introduce the symmetric state @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 is any fixed orthonormal basis in @xmath34 , and the corresponding projection @xmath35 @xmath36 onto it .",
    "theorem [ th1 ] the following results hold :    * @xmath20 is positive on @xmath9 if and only if @xmath37\\,\\vert\\phi\\otimes\\psi\\rangle=\\frac{1}{d } \\langle\\psi\\vert\\lambda[\\,\\vert\\phi^*\\rangle\\langle\\phi^*\\vert\\ , ] \\vert\\psi\\rangle\\geq 0\\ ] ] for all normalized @xmath38 and @xmath39 , with @xmath40 denoting the conjugate of @xmath38 with respect to the fixed orthonormal basis in @xmath34 @xcite .",

    "remark [ rm1 ] physically speaking , this theorem states that , when @xmath45 is a generic one - dimensional projection , positivity of @xmath20 guarantees the positivity of @xmath46 $ ] only when @xmath47 is separable , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath48 .",
    "local operations must transform states of the bipartite system @xmath30 into states keeping the positivity of the associated density matrices ; therefore , the existence of entangled states as @xmath49 excludes that @xmath20 , when only positive , may correspond to a physically consistent local state - transformation .",
    "remark [ rm2 ] the positivity or complete positivity of @xmath20 depends on the properties of the @xmath50 matrix of coefficients @xmath51 $ ] in .",

    "for instance , if @xmath51 $ ] is not positive , then , by separating positive and negative eigenvalues , one sees that every @xmath20 can be written as the difference of two completely positive maps : @xmath63=\\sum_{\\ell_j\\geq0}\\ell_j\\,g_j\\,\\rho\\,g_j^\\dagger\\ -\\ \\sum_{\\ell_j<0}|\\ell_j|\\,g_j\\,\\rho\\,g_j^\\dagger\\ , \\ ] ] where the matrices @xmath64 , like the @xmath13 s , are orthogonal .",
    "however , no general rule is known that may allow us to recognize the positivity of @xmath20 by looking at the eigenvalues @xmath65 and at the matrices @xmath66 .",
    "one has to content oneself with sufficient conditions as the one which follows , that assumes the existence of just one negative eigenvalue .",

    "it is thus important not only to identify entanglement when present , but also to qualify whether it is bound or not .      the unitary time evolution for a system @xmath6 generated by a hamiltonian operator results automatically completely positive due to the criterion ( iii ) in theorem 1 . on the other hand , when the system is in contact with an external environment , its subdynamics is in general not unitary , incorporating noise and dissipative effects .",
