    "semiflexible polymers are fluctuating macromolecules with a bending stiffness intermediate between that of a random coil ( gaussian chain ) and a rigid rod .",
    "they have been the subject of intense experimental and theoretical study in recent years because many important biomolecules fall in this category .",
    "the elastic behavior of the structural elements of the cytoskeleton ( f - actin , microtubules , intermediate filaments ) as well as that of dna strongly depend on their bending stiffness @xcite .",
    "a widely used minimal model of semiflexible polymers is the wormlike chain model ( wlc ) which treats the filament as a locally inextensible one - dimensional fluctuating curve with bending stiffness @xcite .",
    "this model involves only two length scales , namely , the contour length @xmath0 and the persistence length @xmath1 , which is the correlation length of the polymer directedness related to the chain bending modulus @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the dimensionality of the embedding space . in the limit @xmath4 the semiflexible chain transforms into a gaussian coil and the question of excluded - volume interaction may become relevant ; in the opposite limit @xmath5 the chain approaches the limit of rigid rod , in which case the additional modulus penalizing the local stretching / compression may come into play @xcite . despite its simplicity , the wlc model has been successfully used to describe some important experimental results such as the strong stretching of ds - dna @xcite .",
    "however , the advent of single molecule experiments has revealed many occasions where the complexity of the microscopic architecture of the filament appears to affect its macroscopic behavior in a way that can not be accounted for by the classical wlc model .",
    "an important property of some biomolecules which goes beyond the basic wlc model is spontaneous local curvature .",
    "ftsz is a protein of the prokaryotic cytoskeleton which plays an essential role in cell division as it assembles into the contractile ring ( z - ring ) that divides the bacterium @xcite .",
    "it can be visualized on a mica surface using atomic - force microscopy ( afm ) .",
    "an important property of many ftsz protofilaments is the spontaneous curvature of their relaxed state .",
    "their role in force generation strongly depends on the determination of their persistence length @xcite . assuming the relaxed state of ftsz protofilaments to be straight , dajkovic _",
    "@xcite estimated @xmath6 which is much too small .",
    "on the other hand , horger _",
    "@xcite taking into account the finite spontaneous curvature measured by afm ( average radius of curvature @xmath7 ) , determined a persistence length @xmath8 which is close to the value calculated from models of the flexural rigidity .",
    "the existence of stable bent configurations of dna has been known for many years and they play important roles in many basic genetic processes @xcite .",
    "spontaneous curvature in the local structure of dna is sequence - dependent @xcite . as in the case of ftsz ,",
    "the presence ( or absence ) of local spontaneous curvature in a dna filament is crucial in determining the persistence length and its relation to the bending rigidity . in a recent experiment , afm imaging of two - dimensional human dna chains and comparison to measurements on both intrinsically straight and uncorrelated hcv dna",
    "has demonstrated their spontaneous curvature @xcite .",
    "the theoretical study of small ( gaussian ) thermal fluctuations of three - dimensional filaments with spontaneous curvature and torsion has yielded analytical expressions for the orientational correlation functions and the persistence length @xcite .",
    "an auxiliary field theory of three - dimensional polymers with intrinsic curvature has obtained the orientational correlations , mean square separation and the force - extension relation of such chains in the @xmath4 limit , showing that helical configurations arise due to the excluded - volume interaction @xcite .",
    "real filaments with spontaneous curvature in three dimensions also possess a finite twist rigidity which has been shown to affect the end - to - end distribution @xcite and the response to a stretching force giving rise to instabilities @xcite .",
    "the zero - temperature conformations of two - dimensional filaments with constant spontaneous curvature under an applied force for various boundary conditions , as well as the linear response at finite temperature to an applied force , have been recently investigated in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the response of a two - dimensional wlc with spontaneous curvature to a stretching force applied at the ends .",
    "although in general one of course expects the stretched chain to explore fluctuations in both perpendicular directions , the two - dimensional limit is a meaningful simplifying approximation that permits us to carry out a complete analytical study , while retaining some of the relevant qualitative features of the general problem .",
    "the three - dimensional problem is more complicated in two nontrivial aspects .",
    "curvature in @xmath9 is always positive definite whereas in @xmath10 we can define the signed curvature .",
    "in addition , the presence of twist rigidity complicates matters even further @xcite . as we explain in sec .",
    "vii , however , the main conclusion of this work which is the softening of the stretching response due to a spatially varying spontaneous curvature is expected to carry through in @xmath9 . besides , many imaging experimental investigations @xcite are carried out on molecules confined to a surface .",
    "a stretching experiment on dna electrostatically confined to the surface of a fluid membrane is presented in @xcite .",
    "the elasticity of semiflexible polymers without spontaneous curvature in two dimensions has been studied analytically in @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous curvature can in general be inhomogeneous , dependent on the location along the arc length @xmath11 along the chain .",
    "any such variation can be decomposed into fourier harmonics and so we study a case of local curvature varying in an arbitrary sinusoidal fashion along the chain length .",
    "we assume that the filament is weakly bending .",
    "this approximation can be realized in the case of filaments with small spontaneous curvature and small thermal fluctuations or in the case of strong stretching forces which have flattened out the initially large spontaneous curvature and/or the large thermal undulations .",
    "this is the simplest possible extension of the wlc model to include spontaneous curvature analytically .",
    "a formally similar approach has recently been employed in @xcite to study uncorrelated quenched disorder in the spontaneous curvature of stretched two - dimensional filaments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce our model and derive the gaussian energy functional which characterizes the stretched polymer . in the absence of thermal fluctuations ,",

    "formally , they are expressed by the following relations : @xmath33 ( the primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath11 . ) the minimizing configuration , @xmath34 , obeys an euler - lagrange equation which can be obtained by adding an infinitesimal variation , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is infinitesimal and @xmath37 is an arbitrary function of @xmath11 satisfying @xmath38 and @xmath39 and requiring the derivative of @xmath40 as a function of @xmath41 to vanish .",

    "( [ e - l ] ) is linear , a chain with spontaneous curvature containing many harmonic modes yields a response ( @xmath34 ) which is the superposition of the responses for the individual modes .",

    "the average projected length of the filament in the direction of the stretching force is given by @xmath73 where we have used the weakly bending approximation .",
    "there are four different force scales in the general problem , @xmath74 associated with the corresponding length scales : the persistence length @xmath75 , the radius of spontaneous curvature @xmath76 , the wavelength of modulation of the spontaneous curvature @xmath77 , and the contour length @xmath0 .",

    ", we need a filament with very steep undulations of the spontaneous curvature ( @xmath81 )",
    ". this would take us out of validity of the weakly bending approximation .",
    "although we can not make quantitative predictions for this case , we expect the main qualitative features of the predicted behavior to persist .",
    "in the present work , we considered a straightforward extension of the wlc model which incorporates spontaneous curvature to study the response of a two - dimensional weakly bending filament to a pulling force applied at its ends .",
    "the response of a filament with intermediate flexibility ( @xmath124 ) and constant spontaneous curvature is affected appreciably only for large initial curvature , where the effective stretching modulus of the chain softens .",
    "if the spontaneous curvature is inhomogeneous , characterized by undulations of a characteristic wavelength , we find a range of forces where these undulations soften the response despite the nonlinear flattening out of thermal fluctuations .",
    "the profile of transverse fluctuations is mostly dominated by the bell - shaped thermal contribution unless the spontaneous curvature undulations are very steep .",
    "although our quantitative results are based on the two - dimensional weakly bending assumptions , the qualitative features are expected to hold more generally as they are related to the length and force scales of the problem . as we have shown in sec .",
    "v , the softening of the stretching response for @xmath125 can be attributed to the fact that the `` pieces '' of the effective freely jointed chain have an end - to - end distance smaller than the corresponding contour length because of their spontaneous curvature .",
    "one might expect a similar hierarchy of length and force scales to persist in the case of a three - dimensional stretched helical filament with the pitch length and the radius playing roles analogous to @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively , thus yielding a similar softening . checking",
    "the validity of this expectation is an interesting direction for future work .",
