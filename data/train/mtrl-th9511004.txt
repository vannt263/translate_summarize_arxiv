    "hydrogen dissociation on metal surfaces has become one of the benchmark systems for the understanding of dissociative adsorption processes .",
    "the h@xmath0/  pd system is particularly interesting as an example of non - activated dissociation over a transition metal surface .",
    "the dissociation process has been studied using molecular beam adsorption experiments  @xcite as well as state resolved time - of - flight measurements of desorbing hydrogen molecules  @xcite .",
    "hydrogen molecules dissociate spontaneously at pd(100 ) , i.e. molecules with low kinetic energy dissociatively adsorb at pd(100 ) surfaces with a large initial sticking coefficient  @xcite .",
    "the preference of non - activated dissociation pathways for low kinetic energies of the h@xmath0 molecules is also consistent with the independence of the initial sticking coefficient on incident angle @xmath4 as well as with the measured maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution of desorbing h@xmath0 molecules which corresponds to the surface temperature of the palladium substrate  @xcite .",
    "there are , however , clear indications that activated pathways exist as well . after a decrease for beam energies below @xmath5 0.15ev",
    "the initial sticking coefficient continuously increases  @xcite . at those larger kinetic energies the dependence of the initial sticking coefficient on the incident angle of the molecules changes into a @xmath6 behavior with @xmath7 increasing up to @xmath8 for beam energies of 0.4  ev .",
    "state resolved desorption experiments show that the occupancy of the first vibrational excitation is significantly higher than that corresponding to a gas of hydrogen molecules in equilibrium with the surface temperature  @xcite .",
    "this finding is called vibrational heating . on the other hand ,",
    "the rotational degrees of freedom are occupied less than what the surface temperature would imply ( rotational cooling )  @xcite . in order to explain the vibrational heating , the values for @xmath9 in the angular distribution , as well as the increase of the sticking coefficient with the kinetic energy of the h@xmath0 molecules it has been found necessary in dynamic studies on two - dimensional model potential - energy surfaces ( pes ) to assume the presence of a small ( about 0.1  ev ) barrier in the _ exit channel _ ,",
    "i.e. in the region of the reaction pathway where the h - h bond is already significantly stretched  @xcite .",
    "such an energy barrier , however , yields an additional kinetic energy of thermally desorbing molecules which has not been measured experimentally  @xcite .",
    "there has been a long debate about the origin of the initial decrease of the initial sticking coefficient with increasing beam energies .",
    "such a decrease and the observed dependence of the initial sticking coefficient on the angle of incidence with a coefficient @xmath10 have been usually assigned to the presence of a weak , metastable molecular bound state of the h@xmath0 molecule in large distance from the surface ( precursor state )  @xcite .",
    "the presence of a precursor state has also been assumed in order to explain the slow decrease of the sticking coefficient with hydrogen coverage  @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation relates the initial decrease to the presence of both activated and non - activated dissociation pathways on the pes  @xcite . at low kinetic energies molecules with unfavorable orientations may reorientate during the dissociation process and follow a non - activated pathway but with increasing kinetic energy this steering is more and more hindered and the number of molecules proceeding along activated pathways increases .",
    "the fundamental understanding of the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen rests on the knowledge of the pes which , as will be stressed below , depends rather cruicially on all six coordinates of the two hydrogen atoms of the h@xmath0 molecule .",
    "experimental data have been interpreted in terms of simple , often two - dimensional model pes as discussed above . very recently , accurate density functional calculation ( dft ) of pes  @xcite and high - dimensional quantum - dynamical simulations  @xcite of h@xmath0 dissociation have become available thus opening the way for complete _ ab inito _ investigations of dissociative adsorption and associative desorption processes .",
    "previous dft studies of the h@xmath0 interaction with metal surfaces concentrated mainly on system where the dissociation is activated .",
    "there are a few studies of the interaction of h@xmath0 molecules in front of surfaces of transition metals with a partly filled @xmath3-states  @xcite . in the recent work of white and bird  @xcite investigating hydrogen dissociation on w(100 ) the presence of non - activated dissociation pathways",
    "was confirmed but in dependence of the center - of - mass position of the molecule in the surface unit cell even for the most favorable orientation of the molecular axis activated dissociation has been obtained as well . molecules with its axis perpendicular to the surface",
    "have been found to experience no attractive interaction . summarizing their results , white and bird expect molecular steering to play an important role in the dissociation dynamics at low incident energies .    in this paper",
    "we present and discuss detailed calculations of the potential energy surface for hydrogen dissociation on pd(100 ) . here",
    "we analyze the physical properties behind the topology of the pes .",
    "we note that the results are now sufficiently complete for a six - dimensional quantum - dynamical simulation of the dissociation of h@xmath0 molecules on pd(100 )  @xcite .",
    "the calculations have been performed using density - functional theory within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite and the full potential linear augmented plane wave method ( fp - lapw )  @xcite .",
    "the application of the gga is of crucial importance for the calculation of pes of hydrogen dissociation  @xcite , but some important questions concerning the accuracy of pes calculated applying the gga remain  @xcite .",
    "the good agreement of experimental data with the results of high - dimensional quantum - dynamical simulation of h@xmath1 dissociation based on the calculated pes for h@xmath0/cu(111 )  @xcite and the pes presented in this paper  @xcite shows that the gga reproduces the important features of these pes with sufficient accuracy .",
    "the fp - lapw wave functions in the interstitial region are represented using a plane wave expansion up to @xmath11=11 ry , and due to the small radius of the muffin - tin sphere around h atoms ( @xmath12  ) it is necessary to take into account plane waves up to @xmath13=169  ry for the potential representation  @xcite . inside the muffin - tin spheres the wave functions",
    "are expanded in spherical harmonics with @xmath14 , and non - spherical components of the density and potential are included up to @xmath15 . for the * k*-integration we used 64 uniformly spaced points in the two - dimensional brillouin zone corresponding to the c(2@xmath162 ) surface unit cell .",
    "all calculations were performed non - relativistically .    in the calculations we used a supercell geometry .",
    "the metal substrate is modeled by three layers slabs which are separated by a 10   thick vacuum region .",
    "hydrogen molecules are placed at both sides of the slab .",
    "we used a rigid substrate because due to the large mass ratio between pd and h the substrate will not change during the scattering event .",
    "the slab thickness of only three layers has been chosen with respect to the large computational demand of the evaluation of the pes .",
    "the application of such small layer thickness for the pd(100 ) substrate gives an acceptable accuracy of the pes because due to the large density of states at the fermi energy perturbations in the electronic structure induced by the impinging h@xmath0 molecule are screened very effectively .",
    "we confirmed this by increasing the layer thickness of the substrate to 5 layers and comparing the total energy with respect to the separated h@xmath0 and pd(100 ) surface at various points of the reaction pathways .",
    "we found that in the region of the pes where the h@xmath0 molecule approaches the surface and starts to dissociate the differences of the potential energy are less than 0.05 ev per h@xmath0 molecule .",
    "in particular , the character of the dissociation pathway , whether it is activated or non - activated , is not influenced .",
    "this part of the pes determines the dynamics dissociation of the hydrogen molecule  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the adsorption energy on the layer thickness is more pronounced an the region of the pes corresponding to adsorbed h atoms and strong h  pd bonds . here ,",
    "the energy changes with increasing layer thickness up to 0.12 ev per h@xmath0 molecule .",
    "the application of such a small layer thickness for the pd(100 ) substrate is possible because due to the large density of states at the fermi energy perturbations in the surface electronic structure induced by the impinging h@xmath0 molecule are screened very effectively .",
    "we confirmed this by increasing the layer thickness of the substrate to 5 layers and comparing the total energy with respect to the separated and pd(100 ) surface to that of the three layer calculations at various points of the reaction pathways .",
    "we found that the differences in the potential energies are below 0.12  ev and that the changes are considerably smaller for larger heights of the molecule above the surface .",
    "for the pes calculation we employed a supercell with a c(2@xmath162 ) surface structure .",
    "however , in the case of the geometry where the h@xmath0 hits an on - top site and dissociates into two hollow positions h atoms belonging to h@xmath0 molecules in different surface unit cells within a c(2@xmath162 ) structure would come too close during the dissociation process and the unit cell has been enlarged to a p(2@xmath162 ) structure .",
    "the convergence of our results was tested using a p(2@xmath162 ) surface unit cell , a plane - wave cut - off for the wavefunctions expansion of @xmath11=13 ry and a larger h muffin tin radius @xmath17  in the exit channel region .",
    "the resulting changes of the potential energy were again found to be less than 0.08  ev per h@xmath0 molecule .",
    "the potential energy of a hydrogen molecule as it is used throughout the paper is defined as the dft - gga total energy .",
    "the energy zero is the energy of the geometry difference where the molecule is sufficiently far away from the surface , ( @xmath18= 3.7  ) , such that there is practically no interaction between the molecule and the surface .",
    "zero point corrections and other vibrations are not included in the pes .",
    "first , we briefly summarize the properties of bulk pd , the clean pd(100 ) suface , and adsorbed hydrogen atoms  @xcite .",
    "the calculated lattice constant of pd calculated by the dft - gga is 4.03  .",
    "this value is 3  % larger than the lattice constan obtained within the lda , and 3.5  % larger than the experimental value  @xcite .",
    "the clean pd(100 ) surface shows a slight inward relaxation of the topmost pd layer of @xmath190.9 % of the bulk interlayer distance .",
    "this value is close to the relaxation of @xmath190.6 % obtained by dft - lda calculation  @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium position of the hydrogen is the surface hollow site with a small adsorption height @xmath20=0.1   @xcite . at the bridge site",
    "the adsorption energy is about 0.3  ev less favorable and the adsorption height increases to @xmath20= 1.3  .",
    "adsorption at the on - top position is even unstable against associative desorption  @xcite . obviously , this pronounced dependence of the h  pd bond strength on the geometry of the h adatom effects the potential energy during the dissociation process as will be discussed below .",
    "assuming that the positions of the substrate metal atoms can be kept fixed the pes of hydrogen dissociation depends on the six coordinates defining the position of the two hydrogen atoms of the h@xmath0 molecule .",
    "figure  [ scetch ]    shows the coordinate system used to describe the position and orientation of the h@xmath0 molecule .",
    "the center of mass position is given by the three cartesian coordinates ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath18 ) for which the origin is at the center of a surface pd atom .",
    "the two rotational degrees of freedom are given by the angle of the molecular axis with the @xmath18-axis @xmath23 ( cartwheel rotation ) and with the @xmath21direction @xmath24 ( helicopter rotation ) .",
    "the distance between the hydrogen atoms is denoted by @xmath25 .    in order to investigate possible non - activated pathways fig .",
    "[ pes ] gives    the pes as functions of h ",
    "h distance , @xmath25 , and the molecular center - of - mass distance from the surface , @xmath18 , for fixed , characteristic positions of the molecules center - of - mass in the surface unit cell : the bridge ( @xmath21=0 , @xmath22=0.5 @xmath26 , @xmath24=@xmath27))(a ) , the hollow ( b ) ( @xmath21=@xmath22=0.5 @xmath26 , @xmath24=@xmath27 ) and the on - top ( @xmath21=@xmath22=0 , @xmath24=@xmath28)(c ) site .",

    "the dissociation of an hydrogen molecule over the on - top site with fixed coordinates ( @xmath21=0 , @xmath22=0 ) is activated .",
    "the barrier has an energy of about 0.15 ev and is situated in the exit channel region .",
    "figure  [ pes ] shows that non - activated dissociation of h@xmath0 molecules on pd(100 ) is possible over several non - activated pathways including a large region of center - of - mass positions of the hydrogen molecule in the surface unit cell .    the two - dimensional cuts through the pes in fig .  [ pes ] refer to the situation that the orientation of the molecular axis is _ fixed_. in reality the impinging hydrogen molecule rotates .",
    "in the following we discuss the dependence of the potential energy on the orientation of the molecular axis , i.e. on the angles @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the change of the orientations the molecular axis with respect to the surface normal , @xmath23 , and away from @xmath23=90@xmath30 , implies a significant increase of the potential energy .",

    "the potential energy depends sensitively on the orientation @xmath23 ( see filled circles in fig .  [ rot ] ) and the interaction of the molecule with the surface becomes repulsive already for small deviations from @xmath23=90@xmath32 .",
    "these conclusion are confirmed for the extreme case of a hydrogen molecule hitting the surface at the hollow site with its axis fixed perpendicular to the surface .",

    "we expect , however , that the steering of the molecular axis toward energetically favorable orientations is rather effective . at low kinetic energies",
    "the rotational period of the molecule is comparable to the time the molecule spends at distances @xmath18 corresponding to the end of the entrance channel .",
    "a molecule with a kinetic energy of @xmath33=0.05  ev travels 0.6  per 0.03 ps and when it is in the @xmath34=2 rotational state it rotates during this time ( or pathway ) by about 90@xmath32 .",
    "the large increase of the potential energy with angle @xmath23 in fig .",
    "[ rot ] at the end of the entrance channel corresponds to large forces aligning the molecular axis towards orientations where the dissociation becomes energetically favorable ( `` steering effect '' ) . with increasing beam energy in the adsorption experiments  @xcite both the kinetic and rotational energy of the molecules increases",
    "this shortens the time the molecule spends at the end of the entrance channel and it becomes more likely that the molecule is reflected before the axis is aligned .",
    "an increase of the rotational energy implies that states with shorter rotational periods are occupied and those molecules turn out of the favorable orientation again more easely . as a consequence of the reduced steering the inital sticking coefficient reduces  @xcite .    in the high symmetry configurations shown in fig .",
    "[ pes ] the most favorable orientation of the h@xmath0 molecule is that where the molecular axis is parallel to the surface ( @xmath23=@xmath29 ) .",

    "@xmath41 1.8  a position on - top of the surface pd atom ( @xmath38=0 ) is most favorable . at smaller heights the optimal reaction pathway involves a motion of the center - of - mass position towards the hollow sites",

    "both substrates are transition metals but tungsten and palladium crystalize into different lattice types ( w is bcc , and pd is fcc ) . furthermore , w is in the middle of the @xmath42 and pd at the end of the @xmath43 transition metal series .",
    "the pes of hydrogen dissociation on pd(100 ) and on w(100 )  @xcite , however , is qualitatively similar . both pes exhibit several non - activated dissociation pathways .",
    "the pronounced dependence of the potential energy on the orientation of the molecule with repect to the surface metal atoms , especially on `` cartwheel '' rotations , is found also on w(100 ) .",
    "there are also characteristic differences between both pes .",
    "this is already documented in the different equilibrium adsorption site , which is at the bridge position on w(100 ) in contrast to the hollow site on pd(100 ) .",
    "the geometry of the non - activated dissociation pathways on both surfaces is different .",
    "for example the dissociation with fixed center of mass position over the hollow site has an energy barrier of 0.3 ev on w(100 ) but no barrier on pd(100 ) .",
    "these differences will influence details of the dynamics of the hydrogen molecules on the pes .",
    "the calculations confirm , however , that the central features of the pes of hydrogen dissociation , e.g. the presence of non - activated dissociation pathways , are determined by the presence of a partly filled @xmath3-band in the electronic structure of both transition metal substrates .",
    "the large reactivity of transition metals for hydrogen dissociation given by the presence of dissociation pathways with no or only small energy barriers is actuated by a partly filled @xmath3-band  @xcite .",
    "the mechanism how the @xmath3-band may affect the energetics of hydrogen dissociation has been interpreted in different ways . within the harris - andersson model",
    "@xcite the repulsive interaction and the formation of barriers for h@xmath0 dissociation on surfaces of simple and noble metals is , based on the work of zaremba and kohn  @xcite , related the pauli repulsion between the closed shell configuration of the h@xmath0 molecule and the tails of the @xmath44-waves of the surface electronic structure . at transition metal surfaces",
    "the pauli repulsion is suppressed by a low - energy occupation redistribution of electrons out of the @xmath44-tails into the large density of holes in the @xmath3-band just above the fermi energy .",

    "those results , which are not consistent with the harris - andersson model  @xcite , have been consistently explained within a reactivity model  @xcite related to the frontier orbital concept  @xcite .",
    "superimposed to the interaction of the hydrogen molecule with the @xmath44-states of the metal , which gives rise to energy barriers found at simple metals , there is a contribution due to the direct interaction of h@xmath0 with the metal @xmath3-states .",
    "it is repulsive as long as both the bonding and the antibonding states of the interaction of the h@xmath45 @xmath46-orbital with the metal @xmath3-bands are occupied but becomes attractive in the case that the antibonding states get depleted . for transition metals with a high density of @xmath3-states just at and _ below _ the fermi level the states which are antibonding with respect to the adsorbate surface interaction are pushed above the fermi level .",
    "thus these antibonding states remain empty level already in the case of a weak h@xmath0surface interaction and a small or absent dissociation barrier results .",

    "he found , that the potential energy variations are governed by the orientation dependence of the bond strength of the h atoms and the metal @xmath3-state .",
    "the most favorable orientation of the h@xmath0 molecule is not that of the highest symmetry but that optimizing the h  surface bond strength .",
    "our results confirm the conclusion that the topology of the pes is determined by the direct interaction of the hydrogen molecule with the electronic states of the metal surface .",

    "[ diff]a the h@xmath0 molecule is over the on - top site and the potential energy has already a large negative value of -0.28 ev and corresponds to the minimum in fig .",
    "[ pes]c . in comparison fig",
    "[ diff]b shows the situation where the h@xmath0 molecule is over the hollow site and the potential energy is close to zero .",
    "figure  [ diff]a clearly visualizes that the h@xmath0metal surface interaction is connected with a large polarization of both the h@xmath0 molecule and the metal valence electrons .",
    "the drop in the potential energy in fig .",
    "[ pes]c is caused by a direct interaction between the @xmath48 state of the h@xmath0 molecule and the @xmath49-orbital of the surface pd atom which has a large density of states just below the fermi level  @xcite .",
    "there is an occupation redistribution _ inside _ the @xmath3-shell which _ depletes _ the @xmath49-orbital thus reducing the pauli repulsion . furthermore",
    ", holes are introduced into the @xmath48 state weakening the h - h bond .",
    "in addition an increase of electron density around the center of the h atoms and a more delocalised accumulation of charge density around the pd atom occurs corresponding to an interaction of the antibonding @xmath50-orbital of the hydrogen molecule with metal states just above the fermi level . in the case",
    "that the h@xmath0 molecule is shifted from the on - top towards the hollow site in fig .",
    "[ diff]b the interaction with surface pd @xmath3-states having a large density of states just below the fermi energy is much weaker .",
    "the charge density induced around the hydrogen molecule is now more similar to the orthogonalization hole found for hydrogen dissociation at the @xmath44-metal surface al(110 )  @xcite .",
    "but also in this case there is a considerable depletion of the @xmath49-orbitals of the surface pd atoms and an internal occupation conversion inside the @xmath3-shell . due to the weaker polarization of the @xmath3-orbitals",
    "the potential energy is increased in comparison to the position over the on - top site but also in this case no barrier forms .",
    "it is interesting to note , that the polarization pattern in fig .",

    "we have calculated the pes of hydrogen dissociation on the clean pd(100 ) surface using density functional theory and treating exchange - correlation in the generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite .",
    "the results confirm the presence of several , non - activated dissociation pathways .",
    "it is shown that  cartwheel  rotations of the molecular axis out of the favorable orientation parallel to the surface are connected with a large increase of the potential energy , thus confining non - activated dissociation pathways to a small angular region of molecular axis orientations nearly parallel to the surface .",
    "`` helicopter '' rotations , on the other hand , are hindered mainly because of steric restrictions if the h  pd distance becomes shorter than a typical h ",
    "pd bonding length .",
    "the calculations gave no evidence of a weak molecular bound state , or precursor state , of the h@xmath0 molecule at large distances in front of the surface .",
    "there is nearly no repulsion of h@xmath0 molecules in the entrance channel of the reaction pathways even in the case of the activated adsorption pathways and thus no appreciable energy is required for the hydrogen molecule to come close enough to the surface in order to form hydrogen - metal bonds .",
    "the observed pronounced differences in the potential energy in dependence of the geometry of the molecule with respect to the surface is governed by the orientation and bond length dependence of the covalent interaction of the hydrogen atoms mainly with the different pd @xmath3-bands .",
    "summarizing these results it is concluded that the dynamics of the hydrogen molecule on the high - dimensional pes can not be understood using low - dimensional model surfaces but require a quantum dynamic simulation including all degrees of freedom of the hydrogen molecule .",
    "those calculations have been performed using the calculated pes presented in this paper as an input  @xcite ."
