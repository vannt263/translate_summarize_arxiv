    "<S> a systematic study of i - v characteristic curves for rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 [ ru-(1212 ) ] is presented , with magnetic fields up to 3 t and 5 k @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath2 30 k , in the region of the superconducting transition . </S>",
    "<S> the activation energy @xmath4 for flux line depinning was determined by fitting the nonlinear region of the curves using the flux creep model . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 was found to vary linearly with temperature , while a power - law dependence on the magnetic field was observed up to @xmath5 = 0.1 t , where an abrupt reduction in its decreasing rate occurs . </S>",
    "<S> the extrapolated value , @xmath6 @xmath750 mev , is twice the reported value for yba@xmath0cu@xmath8o@xmath9 , but the critical current density @xmath10 @xmath770 a/@xmath11 is about one order of magnitude lower . </S>",
    "<S> these results are explained as a consequence of the contribution of the magnetization in the grains to the effective field at the intergranular links and to a spin - flop transition of the ru - sub - lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> the ruthenate - cuprates rusr@xmath0rcu@xmath0o@xmath1 , where r = gd or eu , are superconducting ( sc ) materials which exhibits long - range ferromagnetic ( fm ) order at a temperature @xmath12 @xmath13 135 k , well above the onset temperature of the sc transition , at @xmath14 @xmath13 40 k.@xcite although since the early works there were evidences of interaction between the ru moments and the charge carriers , the interplay between magnetism and the transport properties in this compound is still an open issue . </S>",
    "<S> different magneto - resistive behaviors have been reported above and below @xmath15.@xcite peaks in the dc and microwave resistivity@xcite and changes in the hall coefficient near @xmath12 have been also observed.@xcite in relation to the sc transition , it has been found that the resistive curves show a quite different magnetic field dependence from that observed in the conventional cuprates.@xcite another important characteristic is the large sc transition width ( @xmath16 @xmath17 15 - 20 k ) even in good quality polycrystalline compounds . </S>",
    "<S> microwave resistance measurements in powder samples have demonstrated that this is due to a significant contribution from the intergrain network , which is assumed to be under the influence of spontaneous vortex phase formation within the grains.@xcite thus , a study of the magnetic field dependence of the intergrain coupling is essential to determine if the magnetization in the grains actually leaves a sizeable effect in the connectivity of the weak - link network . </S>",
    "<S> however , a quantitative study of the magnitudes characterizing the intergrain transport properties in the ruthenate - cuprates is still lacking .    </S>",
    "<S> this motivated our investigation of the @xmath18-@xmath19 dissipation curves in rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 [ ru-(1212 ) ] . in this work we present a systematic study of the magnetic field and temperature dependence of the characteristic @xmath18-@xmath19 curves in this compound , measured in fields up to @xmath5 = 3 t. the intergranular flux creep activation energy of the josephson </S>",
    "<S> vortices @xmath20 and its dependence on the applied current , magnetic field and temperature were determined by fitting the non linear region of @xmath18-@xmath19 curves according to the flux creep model.@xcite a comparison with the conventional cuprates concerning the contributions to @xmath4 and the behavior of the intergrain transition peak , as determined from the resistive curves , suggest that the ru magnetization makes an important contribution to the local field at the junctions . </S>",
    "<S> this is strongly supported by the @xmath21 behavior , showing an abrupt reduction , by a factor of @xmath177 times , in the decreasing rate at @xmath5 = 0.1 t. we argue that this is a consequence of a spin - flop transition of the ru moments .    </S>",
    "<S> polycrystalline rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 was prepared by conventional solid - state reaction ; details of sample preparation and microstructure can be found elsewhere.@xcite the room temperature x - ray diffraction pattern corresponds to rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 , with no spurious lines being observed . </S>",
    "<S> scanning electron microscopy revealed a relatively uniform size distribution with rounded grains of about 1 - 3 @xmath22m.@xcite bars of @xmath1710 mm in length and 0.6 mm@xmath23 cross sectional area were cut from the sinterized pellet . </S>",
    "<S> resistive measurements were made with a standard four - probe technique , using silver paint with a contact resistance of @xmath171 - 2 @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> current vs. voltage ( @xmath18-@xmath19 ) measurements were performed at various temperatures and magnetic fields in a quantum design ppms system , with @xmath5 = 0 , 0.01 , 0.03 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.3 , 1 , and 3 t , for 5 k @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath2 30 k. since the zero resistance temperature @xmath25 rapidly diminishes with the increase in @xmath5 , the accessible temperature measuring range below t@xmath26 was about 10 - 15 k for @xmath5 @xmath27 0.3 t and @xmath17  5 - 8 k for higher fields . </S>",
    "<S> for each magnetic field , a set of curves was measured with a temperature interval @xmath28 t = 0.3 k and a current step of 0.45 ma . </S>",
    "<S> the usual electric field criterion of 1 @xmath22v / cm was used to determine the critical current density @xmath29.@xcite typically , about 30 - 40 points were collected in the nonlinear region .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 shows a set of experimental @xmath18-@xmath19 curves measured for @xmath5 = 0.3 t. a similar behavior was observed for other measured magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the continuous lines are fittings described below . </S>",
    "<S> these curves exhibit qualitatively the same features observed for the conventional granular cuprates : a noticeable decrease of @xmath29 with the rise in temperature and a clearly distinguishable nonlinear region which smoothly evolves to a linear dependence . for @xmath5 = 0 </S>",
    "<S> , the critical current density at the lowest measured temperature ( @xmath3 = 10 k ) was only 50 a/@xmath11 . a linear extrapolation to @xmath3 = 0 k gives @xmath30 = 70 a/@xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the non linear region of the experimental curves was fitted using the well known expression,@xcite @xmath31 \\tag{1}%\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the applied current , @xmath32 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath20 is the flux creep activation energy of the josephson vortices . </S>",
    "<S> the pre - factor @xmath33 allows a continuous transition to the flux flow regime . </S>",
    "<S> the activation energy was assumed to vary linearly with @xmath18 as @xmath34 . an alternative dependence , @xmath20 @xmath35 @xmath36 , was also considered , leading to unsatisfactory fittings . for a fixed magnetic field , the @xmath4 values for a set of curves were determined and plotted as a function of temperature , as shown in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> a linear behavior was obtained for @xmath5 @xmath2 0.3 t , where the measuring temperature intervals are larger , with slopes which regularly diminish with the increase in field . for @xmath5 @xmath37 0.3 t , although the studied temperature range is smaller , the data also clearly follows a linear dependence . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the intergrain links in ru-(1212 ) behave as sis - junctions . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that the linear behavior is observed for temperatures relatively far from @xmath14 ( 0.1 @xmath2 @xmath38 @xmath2 0.6 ) . due to the broad sc transition width </S>",
    "<S> , it is not possible to study the behavior near @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the extrapolation to @xmath3 = 0 of the zero field curve gives @xmath6 = 50 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the activation energies were found to strongly depend on the intensity of the field . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 shows a log - log plot of the field dependence of @xmath20 , measured at @xmath3 = 10 k. it is found that a power - law dependence , @xmath21 @xmath35 @xmath39 , with @xmath40 = 0.75 , describes quite well the data up to @xmath5 = 0.1 t , where a noticeable reduction in the decreasing rate is observed .    </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the obtained flux creep activation energies with the conventional cuprates must be performed carefully . </S>",
    "<S> one important point is to distinguish between the pinning potential @xmath41 and the activation energy for flux line depinning@xcite@xmath42 where @xmath43 is the applied current density , @xmath44 is the local macroscopic flux density , @xmath45 is the intergranular flux bundle volume , and @xmath46 is the intergranular potential range . there has been a plethora of @xmath41 and @xmath20 energy values , ranging from a few ev s to a few mev s , obtained by a number of different methods . at times , there has been a tendency to interchange freely these parameters and to bunch all the values together , regardless of whether one is dealing with single crystals or polycrystalline materials . </S>",
    "<S> so , we make a comparison solely with reports which make this clear distinction . </S>",
    "<S> since ru-(1212 ) is simply obtained from the yba@xmath0cu@xmath47o@xmath9 ( ybco ) structure by full replacement of cu(1 ) sites at the chains by ru ions , which add two oxygen atoms to their neighborhoods,@xcite this material is an ideal reference for comparison with the conventional cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> while the @xmath48 values in good quality ybco ceramic samples are in the 10 - 15 ev range,@xcite @xmath6 is only about 26 mev , with @xmath10 @xmath13 600 a / cm2.@xcite we note that although our value of @xmath6 = 50 mev is twice the reported value for ybco , @xmath10 is about one order of magnitude lower . </S>",
    "<S> although an independent determination of the pinning potential @xmath41 is needed for an exact quantitative balance of the different contributions to @xmath20 , it is interesting to analyze the second term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) , since it depends on the local field at the intergrain junctions . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic fields of @xmath17600 - 700 oe have been measured by muon spin rotation@xcite and gd - electron paramagnetic resonance@xcite in sites located in the neighborhood of the ruo@xmath0 layers . </S>",
    "<S> although the dipolar field rapidly decays with distance , fields as small as a few tens of oersted or less at the junctions , acting in the whole volume of the sample , will have a great impact in the connectivity of the weak - link network . </S>",
    "<S> eventually , the effect of the local field may completely inactivate low quality junctions , in such a way that the current loops of the josephson vortices can meander only through a fraction of high quality connections . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an increase in the area and volume of the intergranular flux bundle . for polycrystalline samples , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the correlation length along an intergranular flux line and @xmath51 is the area of the flux bundle . since @xmath29 @xmath52  ( @xmath53,@xcite a well - connected granular material with high @xmath29 should be close to the minimal values @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the average grain radius . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption was proved to describe well the intergranular contribution to the ac magnetic susceptibility in good quality ybco@xcite and bscco@xcite ceramic samples . in a network with its intergranular coupling weakened by an internal field , as we believe to occur in ru-1212 , a moderate increase in both @xmath50 and in the radius of the intergranular current loop of only twice the minimal values can account for a decrease in @xmath29 of about one order of magnitude , which is the variation observed in comparison to ybco . </S>",
    "<S> the assumption of an increased @xmath45 is supported by the fact that the intergrain transition peak for ru-1212 , as determined from the derivative of the resistive curve , is very well defined and intense , as shown in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , indicating that the intergrain transition occurs in a narrow temperature interval across junctions of similar qualities , which survive  the action of the magnetization of the grains . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is at variance with the conventional cuprates , exhibiting an intergrain peak of small amplitude as a consequence of a broad - in - temperature phase - lock process across a wide distribution of links qualities . </S>",
    "<S> the idea that the magnetization of the grains plays a relevant role in the connectivity of the intergrain network is confirmed by the @xmath21 dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we have previously found that in ru-(1212 ) the ac magnetic susceptibility in the presence of a dc bias and the intergrain transition temperature change their behavior just at @xmath5 @xmath57 0.1 - 0.3 t.@xcite these results were explained in terms of a re - arrangement of the ru moments , leading to a state of reduced magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> we recall here that a change in the neutron diffraction pattern of ru-(1212 ) is observed when a magnetic field @xmath5 = 0.4 t is applied,@xcite a result interpreted as due to a spin - flop transition . </S>",
    "<S> also , detailed magnetic measurements in this compound indicate that a spin - flop transition should occur at a critical field of @xmath170.14 t.@xcite these values are near to the field at which the change in the @xmath21 behavior is observed . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the reduction in the suppression rate of @xmath20 for @xmath5 @xmath37 0.1 t is a consequence of a magnetic transition of the ru - sub - lattice , leading to a decrease of the average contribution from the magnetization in the grains to the net local field at the junctions .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the intergranular dissipation curves for rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 are properly described by the flux creep model . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed study of @xmath18-@xmath19 curves in a polycrystalline samples allowed , for the first time to our knowledge , a quantitative determination of the flux creep intergranular activation energy and its temperature and magnetic field dependence in this compound . </S>",
    "<S> evidence was provided indicating that the effect of the magnetization of the grains on the weak - link network is essential to understand the differences with the conventional high temperature superconducting cuprates .    </S>",
