    "because w sgr = hd 164975 = ads 1102 is a very bright cepheid , its radial velocities have been measured for more than a century . with hindsight",
    ", we can even say that the system has been teasing us for that long .    although there were suggestions that there might be orbital motion as well as pulsation in the velocities , it was not until 1989 ( babel , et al .",
    "1989 ) that a spectroscopic orbit was determined from all the previous velocity observations .",
    "this was achieved largely because of the precision of the coravel velocities , since the orbital velocity amplitude k is only 2.4 km sec@xmath3 .",
    "further radial velocity work ( albrow and cottrell , 1996 ; pettersen , cottrell , and albrow , 2004 ) has continued to improve the orbit .    in the meantime ,",
    "the system had apparently been resolved with speckle interferometry ( morgan 1978 ) with a separation between the components of @xmath4 .",
    "it was , however , not resolved by bonneau , et al .",
    "babel , et al . realized that their 4.9 year orbit was not compatible with the interferometric companion .",
    "ultraviolet low resolution international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) spectra showed that a hot companion was clearly present ( bhm - vitense , 1985 ; bhm - vitense and proffitt , 1985 ; evans , 1991 ) .",
    "a breakthrough came with the hst fine guidance sensor ( fgs ) observations of benedict , et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , whose main aim was to measure the stellar parallax .",
    "they were able to measure the orbital motion of the primary ( cepheid ) on the sky with the fgs . combining these measures with the spectroscopic orbit of petterson , cottrell , and albrow",
    ", they were able to solve for the orbital parameters including the inclination . by assuming a mass of the companion inferred from a spectral type , a mass for the cepheid can be derived from the orbit .",
    "determining information about the companion in the 4.3 year orbit is the topic of this study .",
    "it can be noted from the summary above that there have been some contradictions and challenges in obtaining information about the orbit .",
    "the low orbital velocity amplitude necessitates high accuracy velocities , and additional data would be valuable .",
    "information on resolution of the system has not been consistent .",
    "in addition , using a mass of the secondary inferred from the iue spectral type and the mass function of the orbit leads to a very small inclination for a reasonable cepheid mass .",
    "w sgr = ads 11029 also has two possible faint companions at 33 `` and 47 '' separations , which will also be discussed here to investigate the membership of the system .",
    "wide companions are particularly useful in that they contain information about interactions the system has had with other stars in the vicinity .",
    "possible companions such as these are worth investigating because they are relatively low mass stars .",
    "patience , et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find that high mass systems are more likely to have small mass ratios than low mass stars .",
    "furthermore , higher mass systems have larger maximum separations of companions ( kraus and hillenbrand , 2007a ) .",
    "it is valuable to investigate further both these characteristics for stars as massive as cepheids ( typically about 5 m@xmath2 ) .",
    "differences between high mass systems and low mass systems point to differences in formation scenarios .",
    "assembling information about the properties of binary and multiple systems is a key ingredient in studying star formation processes .",
    "currently it is not clear how capture and fragmentation processes are balanced , nor the relation between multiple systems and disks .",
    "furthermore , once the system configuration has been set , dynamical evolution can produce additional changes .",
    "it is becoming clear , however , that high mass systems have a higher binary frequency and larger maximum separation than lower mass systems .",
    "a number of images of the w sgr system were taken under hst programs ( d. massa , p. i. ) .",
    "the system was on the target list of a program to resolve cepheids with composite spectra and ultimately determine the distances ( see massa and evans , 2008 ) .",
    "w sgr was a good candidate for resolution because the low orbital velocity amplitude made a low inclination likely .",
    "a series of space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) spectra were obtained at changing roll angles , and at different times in the orbital period .",
    "the observation program was very similar to that of aw per ( massa and evans , 2008 ) . that paper provides a full discussion of the observing details .",
    "the images were made with the g230l grating and the stis nuv - mama detector , which provided spectral coverage from 1800 to 3400  . in order to determine the separation ( including the orientation )",
    ", observations were taken at 3 roll angles . at each of these",
    ", observations were made with the target at 3 locations on the detector offset by @xmath5@xmath6 .",
    "the stis image discussed below is shown in fig .",
    "the answer to some of the puzzles about the system is immediately obvious in the image .",
    "the cepheid dominates the spectrum at the longest wavelengths . using reasonable estimates for the mass of the cepheid and the companion , the spectroscopic system at the distance of the cepheid would only be a few @xmath7 , and hence unresolved from the cepheid on the stis image .",
    "the hottest star in the system , the star which dominates the iue spectrum from 1200 to 1800  , however , is clearly resolved from the cepheid .",
    "we designate the stars in the image aa : the cepheid , ab : the companion in the spectroscopic orbit , and b : the resolved ( hottest ) star in the stis image .",
    "the purpose of this study is to determine the properties of ab .",
    "the extraction of spectra from the image requires the determination of a point spread function ( psf ) of the spectrum , which varies with position on the detector .",
    "it is evident in fig .",
    "1 that the two spectra are close enough that a well understood psf is needed for the extraction .",
    "the native 1024x1024 format of the stis nuv mama detector anode array when used with the g230l grating has a plate scale of about @xmath8/pixel in the cross dispersion direction . in the near - uv",
    "this provides only about one pixel per resolution element , and so is rather undersampled .",
    "there is however , a way to measure the subsampled psf which is needed to extract the two w sgr spectra .",
    "the g230l spectrum is rotated at a slight angle with respect to the anode array which measures the locations of photons incident on the mama detector . from one end to the other , the spectrum crosses about 16 rows of pixels , effectively subsampling the psf in the cross - dispersion direction .",
    "the relative location of the spectrum in the cross dispersion direction as a function of wavelength will be referred to as the spectral trace .    to measure the psf we use an observation of a single star taken with the same mode as the science observations .",
    "the w sgr g230l observations used the f25ndq1 neutral density filter to keep the target below allowed bright object limits .",
    "however , for this filter / aperture combination , only a single calibration observation was ever done .",
    "this was data set o3zx08k0 , with the wd standard gd153 as the target . for the w sgr observations we used this observation to provide our reference cross - dispersion psf .",
    "the subsampled psfs were prepared by using the stsdas stis package task  wx2d \" to subsample each row of the original flatfielded images of the psf stars by 8x in the cross dispersion direction . the resulting cross - dispersion profile in each column",
    "was then smoothed over 32 pixels in the dispersion direction to average over the different pixel centerings and produce our adopted psf profile as a function of wavelength .",
    "the fitting of these psfs also allowed us to measure the tilt of the spectral trace as a function of wavelength over the detector .",
    "as an example of fitting the components and projected separations , we will use observation o6f109020 of w sgr .",
    "the flat fielded image is shown in fig 1 .",
    "for each flat fielded science image of the target star , we also used the wx2d task to produce images that were sub - sampled by 8x in the cross dispersion direction .",
    "then at each pixel in the dispersion direction we fit the observed profile as a sum of multiple psfs using a marquardt - levenson algorithm , and allowing the location and size of each component to be free parameters .",
    "this fit yields a position and a relative count rate for each component as a function of wavelength .",
    "the location of the spectral trace is not completely stable from observation - to - observation .",
    "we adjusted the trace as initially determined from the psf star to subtract any systematic shift of the position of the primary star as a function of wavelength . for image o6f109020",
    "this gives the results shown in fig .",
    "2 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "1 , the hotter component dominates at short wavelengths and the cooler star at long wavelengths .",
    "this makes the relative separations measured at the ends of the spectra less reliable than those measured at wavelengths where the two components have more comparable fluxes .",
    "we therefore derived the adopted stellar separation for each image by only using the median difference between the stellar positions as measured between columns 200 and 600 , where components a (= aa + ab ) and b were clearly resolved .",
    "we estimate that the uncertainty in measuring the projected separation at a given pa is about 0.03 pixels .",
    "results for the separation as a function of position angle as measured in each image are shown in table 1 for the series of images taken on june 6 , 2002 .",
    "a second series of images were taken on june 19 , 2003 .",
    "however , in this series , the cepheid was at a much brighter phase , and measurements were significantly less accurate . combining the measured separations in table 1 , and assuming that the cross dispersion plate scale for the filtered f25ndq1 g230l image ( @xmath8/pixel ) we find that the hotter companion for w sgr is located at a distance of @xmath9 @xmath5 @xmath10 at a position angle of 210.0 @xmath5 0.5 degrees .",
    "( further detail is provided by fig . 10 in massa and evans , 2008 . )      in order to obtain further information about the companion in the spectroscopic orbit , the two resolved spectra in the image were extracted . for this purpose ,",
    "a stis observation where the cepheid is close to minimum light was selected to enhance the contribution from the close companion .",
    "the image used ( o6f109010 ) also has one of the the best projected separations ( o6f109010 for w sgr ) .",
    "the exposure was taken at ( mid exposure ) : 2002 06 06 10:56:00 = 2,452,431.955 . using the period from szabados ( 1989 )",
    "p = 7.594904 e = 2443374.622 , the cepheid was at phase 0.55 during the observation .",
    "using the light curves of moffett and barnes ( 1984 ) , corrected to this period , the cepheid parameters at this phase are v= 4.92 mag and b - v = 0.96 .",
    "the reddening for w sgr is e(b - v ) = 0.11 corrected for the effect of the hottest companion ( evans , 1991 ) .",
    "we prepared a flat fielded image in which we subtracted out the contributions of the hottest star , w sgr b , using the best fit parameters derived above .",
    "we then used the standard stis stsdas x1d task to extract the spectrum for the w sgr a = aa + ab . to minimize the residual contamination from errors in the subtraction of adjacent stars we used a 3 pixel high extraction box to measure the flux .",
    "the x1d task automatically corrects the flux for the encircled energy extraction as a function of extraction box size .",
    "this gives us an extracted spectrum for each star while minimizing the contribution for adjacent stars .      as discussed above stis",
    "provides two spatially resolved spectra , one of the hottest star in the system , the other the composite of the cepheid and the companion in the spectroscopic orbit .",
    "the next step is to investigate whether we can identify the spectroscopic companion in the composite spectrum at any wavelength . in order to do this ,",
    "we have compared the composite spectrum with two nonvariable supergiants which bracket the cepheid in ( b - v)@xmath11 using iue spectra .",
    "table 2 lists the relevant parameters for the supergiants @xmath12 aqr and @xmath13 aqr .",
    "the supergiants have been scaled to match the flux of the w sgr spectrum between 2600 and 3000  .",
    "3 - 6 show the comparisons .",
    "the normalized energy distributions of both @xmath12 aqr and @xmath13 aqr match that of w sgr reasonably well from 3200 to 2500  .",
    "since they bracket w sgr at this phase in ( b - v)@xmath11 ( table 2 ) the expectation is that the normalized spectrum of @xmath12 aqr ( g0 ib ) should have a little more flux from 2200 to 1800  and @xmath13 aqr ( g2 ib ) should have a little less . figs . 4 and 6 show that on the contrary , both supergiants have more flux at 2200  , and at least a little more flux at 1900  .",
    "we have even arbitrarily scaled the @xmath13 aqr spectrum by 0.85 from 1800 to 2400  ( fig .",
    "7 ) . even in this comparison",
    "there is no indication that the w sgr flux at 18001900  is any larger than would be predicted by the supergiant spectrum .",
    "that is , there is no indication of a higher proportion of flux contributed at the shortest wavelength due to a companion hotter than the cepheid .",
    "we attribute the extra flux in the supergiants in the 1800 to 2400  region to a subtle difference found in the spectral energy distributions of supergiants covering a range of spectral types from f2 ib to g8 ib ( evans and teays , 1996 ) .",
    "they were compared with energy distributions of @xmath14 cep at 5 phases .",
    "@xmath14 cep has a period very similar to that of w sgr ( 5.37 d ) and should have very similar pulsation .",
    "the supergiants were found to have more flux than @xmath14 cep when compared at phases with the same ( b - v)@xmath11 .",
    "morossi et al .",
    "( 1993 ) found a similar result of extra flux at short wavelengths when comparing a sample of g and k giants with radiative kurucz models .",
    "they attribute this to a non - radiative heating in the giants .",
    "unfortunately we were unable to find an iue exposure in the 1800 to 2000  region of a non - binary cepheid with as cool a value of ( b - v)@xmath11 as this phase of w sgr .",
    "such a spectrum would presumably match the w sgr spectrum over the full 1800 to 3200  spectral range .",
    "the difference in energy distributions between w sgr and the supergiants @xmath12 aqr and @xmath13 aqr limits the detection of a companion which is fainter and only somewhat hotter than the cepheid . clearly fig .",
    "3 - 7 show no sign of extra flux in the 18002000  region from a companion hotter than the cepheid .",
    "there is one further consideration which limits the information we can obtain about the companion in the spectroscopic orbit .",
    "as mentioned above , the configuration used for the w sgr exposures is little used , and not extensively calibrated .",
    "does the w sgr observation allow us to put any limits on the spectroscopic companion ab ?",
    "to investigate this , we have made comparisons with iue spectra of main sequence stars .",
    "the stars and their optical properties are listed in table 3 , together with the iue spectra used for the comparisons .",
    "absolute magnitudes are also listed , taken from schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) . the absolute magnitude for w sgr",
    "was taken from the galactic cepheid database ( fernie , beattie , evans , and seager : http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/ddo/research/cepheids/ ) .",
    "the mean m@xmath15 = -3.76 mag is corrected to -3.51 mag for the phase of observation . combining this with the information in table 3 ,",
    "the main sequence comparison spectra were scaled as appropriate for companions of w sgr .",
    "the scaled main sequence stars and the w sgr spectra are shown in figs . 8 and 9 .",
    "( rescaling the companions to the distance found directly by benedict , et al .",
    "makes an imperceptible difference to the figures . )",
    "an f0 v companion could be part of the composite stis spectrum of w sgr aa + ab only if there were no flux contributed by the cepheid at 1800 - 1900  .",
    "the supergiants bracketting w sgr at the phase of observation indicate that the cepheid should contribute to the spectrum , at least at the level of 0.2 x 10@xmath16 ergs @xmath17 sec@xmath3 @xmath3 .",
    "even if the supergiant flux overestimates the contribution of the cepheid , as found by evans and teays ( 1996 ) , the flux from ab would still be less than the f0 v star .",
    "an f5 v companion , on the other hand would have only a minute effect on the energy distribution , and could easily be part of the system .",
    "from the discussion in the section above , an f0 v companion is ruled out . a companion as cool as f5 v or cooler is possible .",
    "using the mass - spectral relation from harmanec ( 1988 ) , an f0 v and f5 v stars have a masses of 1.5 m@xmath2 and 1.3 m@xmath2 respectively .",
    "we adopt a mass @xmath1 1.4 m@xmath2 for the companion . from the orbital solution of benedict , et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , the mass of the cepheid becomes m @xmath1 5.4 m@xmath2 .",
    "the ads lists two distant possible companions to w sgr = ads 11029 = cd -29 14447 = wds 18050 - 2935 ( table 4 ) .",
    "we examine the information about these two stars to see whether they are likely physical companions . a recent addition to this information",
    "is photometry from the 2mass point source catalogue ( cutri , r. , et al .",
    "2003 ) , which is listed in table 4 for b and c. the 2mass photometry for both stars is quality a , except for j for star c which is an upper limit . for the brighter cepheid itself , photometry at mean",
    "light has been taken from the recent compilation of van leeuwen , et al .",
    "this has been transformed back from the saao photometry to the 2mass system using the relations provided by carpenter ( 2001 ) .",
    "these colors can be corrected for extinction using the e(b - v ) = 0.11 mag ( evans , 1991 ) and an extinction law of mathis ( 1979 ) .",
    "the check we want to make is whether the colors and magnitudes are appropriate for main sequence stars ( slightly pre - main sequence stars ) if they are at the distance of w sgr .",
    "we use a distance of 439 pc for w sgr from the hst fine guidance sensor ( fgs ) parallax from benedict , et al .",
    "2007 . at this distance ,",
    "components b and c have absolute magnitudes m@xmath18 of 1.32 and 3.14 mag respectively .",
    "for comparison , we use the colors and magnitudes for kraus and hillenbrand ( 2007b , table 5 ) .",
    "the unreddened ( j - k)@xmath11 and ( h - k)@xmath11 for b corresponds to spectral type from late k to early m in this table .",
    "this range has m@xmath18 @xmath19 5.0 mag . for component c , ( h - k)@xmath11 and",
    "hence m@xmath18 is similar .",
    "clearly , the observed magnitudes are too bright to be at the distance of w sgr , and hence not physical companions .      the ads 11029 system , then , is made up of three components .",
    "the cepheid ( aa ) and the cool companion ( ab ) and the hot component ( b ) .",
    "if we use the maximum masses ( above ) , the mass ratio of this pair is 0.26 .",
    "these masses and the orbital period ( benedict et al . )",
    "correspond to a semimajor axis of 5.0 au for the aa ",
    "ab pair , corresponding to @xmath20 .",
    "we note that the absolute magnitude m@xmath15 = -3.97 mag found by benedict , et al . from the hst fgs measurements",
    "is in very good agreement with the absolute magnitude found from the iue spectrum of the companion m@xmath15 = -4.00 mag ( evans , 1991 ) .",
    "the third component b , the hottest star , is @xmath21 @xmath9 from a , which corresponds to a distance of @xmath21 72 au at the distance of the system .",
    "this companion might have been the one found by morgan , et al . , although the magnitude difference between it and the cepheid ( 5.3 mag at v ; evans , 1991 ) is very challenging .",
    "this star has a spectral type of a0 v , corresponding to a mass of 2.2 m@xmath2 .",
    "the ratio of the separations between the outer and inner systems is comfortably within tokovinin s ( 2004 ) empirical findings for triple systems .",
    "the two more distant stars do not seem to be physically associated with the cepheid system , making a total of 3 stars in the system .",
    "the stis spectrum of w sgr elucidates some of the puzzles about this well studied cepheid multiple system .",
    "the hottest star in the system , studied in iue spectra is not the companion in the low amplitude spectroscopic binary .",
    "it is a more distant third member of the system .",
    "we have compared the ultraviolet spectrum of the unresolved spectroscopic binary with supergiant and main sequence spectra to put limits on the temperature and mass of the companion .",
    "a companion as hot as f0 v is not compatible with the spectrum . using this a an upper limit",
    ", we infer an upper limit to the mass of the companion of 1.4 m@xmath2 . combining this with the orbit of the system from benedict , et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we find a mass for the cepheid of @xmath1 5.4 m@xmath2 .    we have also investigated two more distant possible companions to see whether they are likely to be additional members of the system .",
    "the absolute magnitudes and colors were calculated from 2mass j , h , and k magnitudes assuming the two stars are the distance of the w sgr system . the resulting magnitude - color combination is not consistent with main sequence stars .",
    "that is , the two stars at 33 `` and 46 '' are not likely to be companions , and the system is limited to three components .",
