    "although the underlying mechanisms can be quite varied in different kinds of events synchronization is central in phenomena from the coordinated clapping of an audience , to the rhythmic firing of pacemaker cells in the heart , to the syncopated firing of neuronal groups .",
    "tognoli and kelso @xcite identify three types of synchrony involving relative phases between coupled regions of the brain : an inphase ( zero - lag ) synchronization ; antiphase in which oscillatory elements have the same intrinsic frequency ; and finally broken symmetry that is near inphase or near antiphase .",
    "phase synchronization is not only a fundamental mechanism giving rise to a collective action of large ensembles of units found in near proximity to each other , which otherwise would behave according to their individual rhythms , not being able to produce a large scale response.@xcite .",
    "an inphase pattern has been observed in brain activity using fmri measurements within a cohort of patients by synchronizing brain activity across individuals watching the same movie @xcite .",
    "the inphase pattern of the activity in different regions of the brain among different members of the audience cohort reveals shared emotional states .",
    "an antiphase pattern in the absence of a task has been explained by li and zhou @xcite as a type of background organized by the spontaneous cortico - cortical communication dynamics .",
    "their two module coupling calculations using both neuron cell and neuron mass models suggest that the antiphase dynamics observed in both is generic .",
    "the challenge is then to explain the anti - synchronization property independently of specific mechanisms .    in nature , many complex networks are modular , composed of subnetworks , with varying internal and external connectivity . here",
    "we study the interaction of two modules ( networks ) , both having the same structure and functionality .",
    "we demonstrate that cooperative dynamics of single units within each module leads to consensus .",
    "when coupled , dynamic consensus can act to counter the influence of the inter - network coupling , resulting in an anti - synchronization of the two networks or it can act to synchronize the cooperative impulse .",
    "the response of the two networks to one another depends on their internal states and on the symmetry of the interaction .",
    "the symmetry of the interactive response has been discussed in the context of coupled chaotic systems as an adaptive control scheme @xcite .",
    "herein the symmetry of the interactive networks is the result of a control process that is dependent on the nature of the coupling of the networks . from this",
    "we establish consistency with the principle of complexity management ( pcm ) @xcite , thereby suggesting the conditions allowing for maximum information transfer across complex networks composed of multiple modules .    in section [ dmm ]",
    "the decision making model ( dmm ) is introduced in terms of the two - state master equation .",
    "a number of the dmm properties are reviewed , such as in the all - to - all ( ata ) coupling of the elements in an infinite sized network the dynamics of the mean field variable are described analytically by a particle in a double - well potential and the magnitude of the potential barrier is a function of a cooperation parameter . for a finite sized network",
    "this description reduces to a langevin equation and the strength of the fluctuations scales with the size of the network and is also a function of the cooperation parameter .",
    "the coupling between two ata dmm networks is considered in section [ network response ] and shown to be equivalent to two coupled langevin equations .",
    "the strength of the fluctuations in the langevin model are estimated from a corresponding dmm calculation thereby making the langevin description empirical .",
    "the sign of the coupling terms determines the symmetry of the coupled network , that is , whether the dynamics of the coupled networks are synchronized or anti - synchronized .",
    "moreover , the conditions under which the maximum information is shuttled back and forth between the modules are determined using relative entropy and it is determined that the information transfer is not dependent on the symmetry of the dynamics .",
    "we suggest that in one possible application of the model the individual subnetworks can represent the cognitive behavior of individuals trying to make a decision between two alternatives .",
    "the potential minima in the langevin model could then be associated with speaking and listening in a two person conversation .",
    "the distribution of time intervals spent with one person talking and the other listening is herein shown to be inverse power law consistent with prior research on turn - taking dynamics in which inverse power law was obtained @xcite .",

[ indiv ] ) and lead to a master equation with time - dependent transition rates :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 contains the transition rates of switching from state @xmath0 to @xmath1 , @xmath12 , and the rates of switching from state @xmath1 to @xmath0 , @xmath13 : @xmath14 .",

    "the values of relative entropy obtained for increasing the coupling strength @xmath112 reinforce the observation that the transfer of information is maximal once one network is in the critical regime [ see fig . [ fig_entropy_cut ] ] .",
    "the values of @xmath142 initially increase with the increase of cooperation parameter @xmath158 to reach maximum at @xmath151 .",
    "this peak is followed by a decrease of @xmath142 and a region of @xmath125 in which the relative entropy is constant suggesting that the two - point pdf is proportional to the product of the singlet pdf s , @xmath159 .",
    "if this ratio is denoted by @xmath160 , then the change in the relative entropy is given by@xmath161and the constant @xmath160 is a function of the control parameters @xmath162 in addition to the dependence on the control parameters through @xmath160 the relative entropy is seen to decrease disproportionately with the coupling strength .     between two langevin equations _ ( left ) _ are compared with values of the relative entropy obtained for two connected networks _ ( right)_. in both cases @xmath156 and @xmath44 and @xmath163 the sizes of the fraction of sensitive nodes adopted for the coupling of two ata  networks were increasing from @xmath164 to @xmath165 for increasing values of @xmath166      the discussion of the external influence exerted on the network through a small fraction of its members presented in section [ adam ] can be adopted to treat the weak coupling between two networks realized with the langevin equation model . in that case one considers two ata networks of size @xmath167 and @xmath168 , whose intra - network dynamics is realized with the cooperation levels @xmath125 and @xmath148 , respectively . here for simplicity we choose @xmath169 .",
    "next the dynamics of a fraction @xmath170 of the free individuals is realized following the rules of normal dmm  dynamics , adopting the expressions for the transition rates defined by eq . [ rates ] .",
    "the fraction @xmath171 of sensitive individuals obey the modified transition rates    @xmath172 ;   \\label{modified rates } \\\\ g_{_{-1\\rightarrow + 1}}^{\\left ( i\\right ) } ( t ) & = & g_{0}\\exp \\left [ k_{1}\\varsigma _ { 1}-\\varsigma _ { 2}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the additional term in the exponent comes from the coupling to the second network .",
    "the transition rates defined for the dynamics of the sensitive individuals in the second network contain opposite indices . with the introduction of the difference variable as before , @xmath173 , the @xmath170  two - state master equations describing the free individuals reduce to eq .",
    "[ tsme ] and the @xmath171 sensitive individuals are described by    @xmath174    the dynamics of the global variable for one network is then    @xmath175    the correspondence with the coupled langevin equation occurs when the coupling is @xmath176 , denoting the fact that in a particular realization weak coupling between two networks can be obtained by making a small fraction of individuals of each network sensitive to the dynamics of the second network .",
    "the effect of the coupling of two ata  networks realized through sensitive individuals is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_entropy_cut ] , where the values of the relative entropy for increasing values of the coupling strength @xmath112 are compared with the langevin equation model .",
    "we observe the same qualitative behavior as in the langevin models , that is , the maximum information transfer occurs at criticality , and the values of the entropy saturate in the supercritical cooperation parameter regime .",
    "( left middle panel ) and @xmath177 ( right middle panel ) , on the shape of the pdf .",
    "bottom panels show the dependence of the equilibrium value of the mean field as a function of the coupling strength @xmath178 .",
    "the size of both networks is @xmath156 and @xmath179 the cooperation parameters are @xmath180 ( blue and light blue lines ) and @xmath181 ( red and pink lines ) . ]",
    "finally , one needs to consider what is the range of validity in which the coupled langevin model recovers the dynamics of two ata  networks coupled with a small number of links .",
    "one significant difference between the direct numerical simulation of an ata  network with dmm  dynamics and the realization of the corresponding langevin equation is the fact that in the dmm the mean field variable @xmath51 is always limited to the range @xmath182 , while the variable @xmath90 present in the langevin equation is not so restricted .",
    "thus , we adopted the value of @xmath112 at which @xmath183 observed for the coupled networks is larger than either @xmath0 or @xmath1 as the measure of the validity limitation for the equivalence of the two approaches .",
    "we investigate the properties of the pdf of the langevin variables @xmath115 and @xmath116 , and that of the dmm  variables , @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "we concentrate our attention on the equilibrium value of @xmath186 and @xmath187 , which corresponds to the location of the maxima of the pdf s for those variables .",
    "the approach is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig_shift ] , where the pdf s obtained for weak coupling , @xmath188 are compared with those obtained for stronger coupling , @xmath189 . in the case of weak coupling",
    "both approaches lead to identical pdf s .",
    "however , stronger coupling in the case of coupled langevin equations results in the peaks of @xmath121 and @xmath121 to be located outside the range @xmath190 , which violates the underlying assumption for the mean field dynamics .",
    "this behavior is not observed for coupled ata  networks independently of the strength of the coupling .",
    "the position of the equilibrium values of @xmath186 and @xmath187 for a wide range of @xmath112 values is also plotted .",
    "one determines for coupling strengths @xmath191 that the coupling does not result in any effective change in either network , being too weak to influence the intra - network dynamics .",
    "additionally , coupling values larger than @xmath192 do not recover the correspondence between the direct simulation of the dmm  and the langevin approach .",
    "herein we have shown that two weakly coupled ata dmm networks each modeled with a two - state master equation can be approximated to a high degree of accuracy by two langevin equations each with a double well potential that is biased by the interaction with the other network . when the percentage of elements within the network that is sensitive to the other network is sufficiently small the coupling can be treated as a perturbation resulting in the symmetry of the mean field for the composite network that depends on the sign of the interaction term .",
    "the sign choice leading to anti - symmetry of the dynamic interaction between these two ata dmm networks makes one think of the adolescent infighting between two political groups that are oppositely polarized . as long as one party holds a particular point of view the other party adopts the opposite point of view .",
    "moreover there is no reconciling them , when a fluctuation induces one group to change its position this change immediately induces a corresponding reaction in the other group to change its position as well .",
    "consequently , the weak coupling between the two groups prevents them from ever reaching accommodation .",
    "furthermore the interaction between two systems leads to an effective increase in the intra - cooperativity of each of them .",
    "the dynamics of coupled networks is reminiscent of the dynamics of a single ata network with a cooperation parameter larger than the one characterizing the interacting subnetwork . using the interpretation of political parties sharing the national stage",
    ", this corresponds to each of them becoming internally more uniform and orderly , eliminating diverse point of view within the group and becoming more radical in the opinions they hold .    in addition",
    "the anti - synchronization mechanism can also model desirable behavior . in the case of two well - behaved individuals carrying on a conversation",
    ", they politely take turns between talking and quietly listening .",
    "the distribution of time intervals between turn taking has been shown to be inverse power law @xcite with an index that is larger than the value of 1.5 found in the coupled langevin model .",
    "an index close to the value -2 that characterizes the optimum transfer of information between two complex networks as predicted by the pcm @xcite was obtained by abney _",
