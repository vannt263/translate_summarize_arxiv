    "in the atlas experiment @xcite at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , straw - tube transition radiation tracker ( trt ) barrel detectors will play an major role in providing precise tracking with transition radiation ( tr ) capability for electron identification . to achieve stability against high - voltage breakdown at the very high interaction rate of the lhc ,",
    "it is important that the sense wires be centered in the 1.44 m - long straws .",
    "an off - center ( offset ) wire will break down at a lower high voltage than a centered wire , reducing the range of operation of the device .",
    "wires can be offset as a function of position for a variety of reasons , including bending of the 1.44 m - long straws .",
    "since the average gas gain also increases with offset , a measurement of gas gain as a function of position along a wire can be used to indicate whether or not the wire is offset at any point @xcite . here , we briefly describe the common features of two x - ray scanners built at hampton university to determine whether wires are offset .",
    "the x - ray photon energy for the gain survey can be chosen to optimize the time to obtain the required gas gain resolution .",
    "this depends on several factors : attenuation of the x - rays in the module , conversion of the x - rays in the active gas , and ability to find the gain through an analysis of the spectrum . for surveying the largest of the three module types ( type 3 )",
    ", we found that 12 kev is close to optimum . to obtain a photon beam of this energy , x - ray fluorescence from bromine was used",
    "; the primary beam came from a 50 kv x - ray tube .",
    "the basic chain of the electronics @xcite and the data acquisition ( daq ) scheme are shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the signals from the sense wires are amplified and shaped and then passed on to adcs .",
    "for each wire , spectra are collected from 50 positions along the @xmath0 direction . for each spectrum ,",
    "a monitor spectrum was collected from a fixed point on a straw ( not being scanned ) exposed to an @xmath1fe source .",
    "the ionization gas was a mixture of argon and co@xmath2 ( 70:30 ) with a flow rate of about 1 straw volume / hr .",
    "the nominal operating high voltage ( hv ) for surveying was set to 1235 volts .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows a typical spectrum from the @xmath1fe source and bromine xrf , respectively .",
    "the raw spectra were recorded with straw number , run number , @xmath0 position , and slow control data .",
    "later , the peak in each spectrum was fitted with a gaussian function that determines the mean ( @xmath3 ) , standard deviation ( @xmath4 ) , and goodness of fit .",
    "the ratio of the straw mean to the monitor mean of @xmath1fe is multiplied by 500 to give the normalized gain , @xmath5 .",
    "the gain variation @xmath6 is defined as @xmath7 and used to determine the wire offset from the center as shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "x - ray scanners for the purpose of quality control of the atlas trt barrel detector modules were developed at hampton university and are operating at hu and cern .",
    "the scanners map the gain using 12 kev photons at 50 points along each straw .",
    "results were used to decide whether wires were removed or re - strung , and to evaluate overall module quality .",
