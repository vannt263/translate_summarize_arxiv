    "there has been a notable progress in the study of the so - called scale - free network ( sfn)@xcite for recent years . in the network theory ,",
    "the random network model was first invented by erds and rnyi@xcite .",
    "recently it was generalized to the small world network models @xcite . furthermore , about five years ago , the sfn was discovered by studying the network geometry of the internet@xcite .",
    "faloutsos brothers@xcite and albert , jeong and barabsi@xcite first showed the scale - free nature of the internet geometry and opened up an area for studying very complex and growing network systems such as internet , biological evolution , metabolic reaction , epidemic disease , human sexual relationship , and economy .",
    "these are nicely summarized in the reviews by barabsi@xcite .    as was studied in the literature@xcite",
    ", the nature of these sfns is characterized by the power - law behavior of the distribution function . here the number of nodes with order @xmath1 can be fit by @xmath9 where @xmath10 . in order to show the power - law distribution of the sfn , albert and barabsi first proposed a very simple model called the albert - barabsi ( ab ) s sfn model@xcite .",
    "this system is constructed by the following process : initially we put @xmath11 nodes as seeds for the system . every time a new node is added @xmath12 new links are distributed from the node to the existed nodes in the system with a preferential attachment probability @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number of links at the @xmath15-th node .",
    "the development of this model is described by a continuum model @xmath16 then at time @xmath17 the system consists of @xmath18 nodes and the @xmath19 links with @xmath20 as studied by barabsi et .",
    "al.@xcite this model exhibits an exact exponent of @xmath21 for the power - law .",
    "thus , it has been concluded that the essential points of why a network grows to a sfn are attributed to the growth of the system and the preferential attachment of new nodes to old nodes existed already in the network .    from the above context",
    ", time evolution to construct an sfn has been intensively studied in the @xmath22-model as well as other models . and",
    "many works have appeared , regarding nodes and links as metaphysical objects such as agents and relationships in an area of science@xcite . however , most approaches were based on the numerical approach . and",
    "the spectra of the adjacency matrix @xmath8 for the sfn have been studied numerically@xcite .",
    "therefore , apart from the purposes for the numerical analysis , the continuous - time sfn models such as the @xmath22-model are not good enough to see what is going on in the network geometry in the microscopic level .    instead of such a continuous - time sfn model ,",
    "a new type of the sfn models , sometimes called deterministic or hierarchical sfn models , has been proposed by barabsi , ravasz , and vicsek@xcite and ravasz and barabsi@xcite ( we would like to call it the dsfn in this paper ) . in the former ,",
    "the study showed a power - law behavior of the network analytically , while in the latter , the study showed it numerically .",
    "however , much is still lack and left unanswered .    on the other hand",
    ", there is a very important problem on the maximum eigenvalue , @xmath23 , of the adjacency matrix , @xmath8 . as was numerically studied@xcite , the maximum eigenvalue for the ab - model",
    "is bounded by @xmath24 such that @xmath25 , where @xmath26 means the maximum order of nodes .",
    "and the numerical studies showed that @xmath27 . and",
    "therefore , the numerical studies validated @xmath28 . on this problem , very recently , chung , lu and vu@xcite have proved a very general theorem : in a complex network model , @xmath23 is always bounded by the lower and upper bounds such that @xmath29 .",
    "define the second order average degree of nodes , @xmath7 ( see sec.iv ) .",
    "then , ( c1 ) if the exponent @xmath30 , then @xmath31 .",
    "( c2 ) if the exponent @xmath32 , then @xmath33 .",
    "( c3 ) and if the exponent @xmath34 , then a transition happens . from this theorem",
    ", the ab - model belongs to the first category since @xmath21 .",
    "however , in spite of the seemingly important theorem , because of the lack of other good examples other than the ab - model , the examples for the other categories have not yet been so well - known so far .",
    "so , the purpose of this paper is to study in much details the dsfn model proposed by barabsi , ravasz , and vicsek@xcite in order to give a good example for the other category of the theorem .",
    "this study will provide a rigorous treatment for the complex network model .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "ii , we will introduce the dsfn model that was first studied by barabsi , ravasz , and vicsek@xcite . in sec .",
    "iii , we will present the exact numbers of nodes and its degrees .",
    "and we calculate the exact scaling behavior of the nodes . in sec .",

    "we will prove several theorems using some mathematical theorems .",
    "and we will discuss the relationship between the results of our theory and the chung , lu , and vu s theorem@xcite . in sec .",
    "xiii , conclusion will be made .",
    "let us introduce the dsfn model invented by barabsi , ravasz , and vicsek@xcite .",
    "the development of this network is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the black and red nodes show the hub and rim nodes .",
    "we call the most connected hub and rim the root and leaf , respectively .        in this model the total number of nodes , @xmath36 ,",
    "the total number of links , @xmath37 , and the maximum number of links , @xmath38 are given by @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 respectively . from these",
    "we find the their development as follows : as @xmath42 , then @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45    let us consider the average link number ( i.e. , the average degree ) @xmath46 of a network .",
    "it is defined by @xmath47 the meaning of this is just the number of links per node ( i.e. , the average degree ) .",
    "we may call it the first order average degree . on the other hand ,",
    "if we use the number @xmath0 of nodes with @xmath1 degree , then we can write the average as @xmath48 therefore , we find that the conversion is carried out by @xmath49 now , we are able to calculate @xmath46 for our dsfn . substituting eq.s ( 8) and ( 9 ) into eq.(11 ) , we obtain @xmath50 @xmath51    in this way , even though the network becomes very complex as @xmath52 , the average approaches a finite constant @xmath53 .",
    "this is due to the following fact : in this dsfn as the iteration is repeated , the order of the most connected hub becomes large indefinitely while its number remains very few ( i.e. , @xmath54 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the numbers of the very few connected nodes become large indefinitely .",
    "hence the sum of the magnitude of order ( @xmath1 ) times the number ( @xmath0 ) of nodes with the order @xmath1 may remain finite .",
    "let us find the exact numbers of nodes and degrees",
    ". this would be very crucial for our later purposes in order to evaluate many quantities in the network theory .",
    "as was discussed by barabsi , ravasz , and vicsek@xcite , in the dsfn there are two categories of nodes called `` hub '' nodes and the `` rim '' nodes . as they called the most connected hub node the `` root '' ( shown as black dots in fig.1 )",
    ", we would like to call the most connected rim node the `` leaf '' ( shown as red dots in fig.1 ) . from seeing fig.1 , the locations of the root node and the leaf nodes look very similar to those of a hub and rims in an umbrella .",
    "while there exists only one roof node in each generation of the network , the number of the leaves can increase very rapidly .",
    "let us first consider the hub nodes . in the @xmath15-th step ,",
    "the degree of the root , is @xmath55 . in the next iteration",
    "two copies of this hub will appear in the two newly added units .",
    "as we iterate further , in the @xmath56-th step @xmath57 copies of this hub will be present in the network .",
    "however , the two newly created copies will not increase their degree after further iterations .",
    "therefore , after @xmath56 iterations there are @xmath58 nodes with degree @xmath55 .",
    "let us next consider the rim nodes . in the @xmath15-th step , the degree of the most connected rim , the leaf , is @xmath15 . and the number of the such nodes is @xmath59 . in the next iteration",
    "one copy of the leaves will be kept the same and two copies of the leaves will appear in the two newly added .",
    "as i iterate further , in the @xmath56-th step @xmath57 copies of the leaves will be present in the network .",
    "therefore , after @xmath56 iterations there are @xmath60 nodes with degree @xmath15 .",
    "now , denote by @xmath1 the degree of nodes and denote by @xmath0 the total number of nodes with degree @xmath1 .",
    "hence we get the following : +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +   +   + table 1 . the number @xmath0 of nodes with degree @xmath1 for the root nodes and leaf nodes . +",
    "as was shown by barabsi , ravasz , and vicsek@xcite , consideration for the root nodes is enough to derive the scaling exponent of the distribution function @xmath0 for the root nodes in the network . picking up the @xmath61 nodes with degree @xmath55",
    ", we can regard @xmath0 as @xmath61 and @xmath1 as @xmath55 . then eliminating @xmath15",
    ", we can derive @xmath62 where @xmath63 this shows a scale - free nature ( i.e. , the fractal nature ) of the hub nodes in the network as we expect@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is not true for the leaves in the network . in this case , regarding @xmath0 as @xmath64 and @xmath1 as @xmath15 , we find @xmath65 where @xmath66 this shows that the scaling nature of the leaf nodes is not scale - free but exponential .    in this way , the scaling nature of the roots and that of the leaves in the dsfn are different from each other .",
    "thus , we are led to a a certain model which consists of a _ multifractal _",
    "nature of the complex networks .",
    "let us calculate the second order average degree , @xmath67 .",
    "it is defined by @xmath68 this quantity was recently introduced by chung , lu and vu@xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "the meaning of this quality is the average degree per link . in other words , it is the average degree weighted with the preferential attachment such that @xmath69 from eq.(14 ) we have @xmath70 we derive @xmath71 where @xmath72 is defined by @xmath73 the second moment per node .",
    "as was shown before , the average degree @xmath74 converges to @xmath53 as @xmath52 .",
    "hence , the second order average degree @xmath67 becomes proportional to the second moment @xmath72 in the limit such that @xmath75    before going to calculate the second order average degree , let us first check whether or not the distributions given in the tables reproduce the correct results for the total numbers of nodes and links .",
    "this problem is trivial .",
    "but as we will see , this is very instructive for our purpose here .",
    "let us show that the distributions of the nodes and degrees are exact .",
    "let us first calculate the total number of nodes , once again . to do so , we just sum them up as follows . for the root nodes we obtain the following : @xmath76",
    "@xmath77 this is the total number of the root ( hub ) nodes ( i.e. , the total number of black dots in fig.1 ) . for the leaf nodes we have the following : @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 this is the total number of the leaf ( rim ) nodes ( i.e. , the total number of red dots in fig.1 ) .",
    "hence , by the addition of both we obtain the desired result : @xmath81 this proves eq.(5 ) .",
    "let us next consider the total number of links in the network .",
    "we calculate it for the root and leaf nodes separately . for the root nodes",
    ", we have the following : @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 similarly , for the leaf nodes , we have the following : @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 at first glance , the summation of eq.(29 ) seems quite tough . but to perform this calculation we can use a mathematical trick as follows : define a function @xmath94 of @xmath95 such that @xmath96 @xmath97 differentiating this with respect to @xmath95 , we obtain @xmath98 @xmath99 substituting @xmath100 into eq.(31 ) and comparing it with eq.(29 ) , we find @xmath101 therefore , once @xmath94 is found as a simple function of @xmath95 , we can calculate the sum .",
    "this can be done as follows .",
    "@xmath96 @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 by differentiating this with respect to @xmath95 , we obtain @xmath105 @xmath106\\ ] ] @xmath107 therefore , substituting @xmath100 into eq.(34 ) , we obtain @xmath108 @xmath109\\ ] ] @xmath110 @xmath111 + n2^{n-1}\\ ] ] @xmath112 substituting this into eq.(32 ) , we obtain @xmath113 in this way , explicitly using the exact numbers of nodes and degrees , we can show that each sum produces the total number of links in the network as we expected .",
    "hence , this proves eq.(6 ) .",
    "this situation encourages us to perform the calculation of the second order average degree of eq.(19 ) .",
    "let us next do this . in eq.(19 ) , we need to separate it into two parts of the sum as follows : @xmath114 @xmath115 let us consider the sum for the root nodes .",
    "using the previous result , we obtain the following : @xmath116 @xmath117 @xmath118 @xmath119\\ ] ] @xmath120\\ ] ] @xmath121\\ ] ] @xmath118 @xmath122\\ ] ] @xmath123\\ ] ] @xmath124\\ ] ] @xmath125 @xmath126 @xmath127    let us consider the sum for the leaf nodes . @xmath128 @xmath129 @xmath130 @xmath131 @xmath132 to calculate eq.(39 ) we need a similar trick as before . using eq .",
    "( 31 ) , we can define @xmath133 @xmath134 differentiating this with respect to @xmath95 yields @xmath135 @xmath136 therefore , substituting @xmath100 into this , we get @xmath137",
    "@xmath138 comparing this with eq.(39 ) , we get the relation @xmath139    let us evaluate this . using eq.(34 ) , we obtain @xmath140 @xmath141\\ ] ] @xmath142 differentiating this with respect to @xmath95 , we have @xmath143 @xmath144\\ ] ] @xmath145\\ ] ] @xmath146 + n^{2}x^{n-1}.        \\eqno{(45)}\\ ] ] substituting @xmath147 into this , we get @xmath148 @xmath149\\ ] ] @xmath150\\ ] ] @xmath151 + n^{2}2^{n-1}\\ ] ] @xmath152\\ ] ] @xmath153\\ ] ] @xmath154 @xmath155 @xmath156 @xmath157 @xmath158 @xmath159 substituting this into eq.(43 ) , we get @xmath160 using eq.(47 ) together with eq.(38 ) , we obtain @xmath161 @xmath162 therefore , the above procedure enables us to evaluate the second order average degree as follows : @xmath163 @xmath164 @xmath165\\ ] ] @xmath166\\ ] ] @xmath167 in this way , the second order average degree @xmath7 is calculated explicitly .",
    "we are able to show that it diverges as an exponetial - law .",
    "let us consider the adjacency matrix , @xmath8 , in the theory of network@xcite .",
    "this matrix is very important for the theory of network , since it represents the topology of the network structure .",
    "denote by @xmath168 the component corresponding to the link between the @xmath15-th node and the @xmath169-th node .",
    "in the theory of network , the elements have only @xmath170 or @xmath171 according to whether or not there is a link .",
    "therefore , in general , the adjacency matrix is defined by    @xmath172    let us consider the adjacency matrix for the dsfn .",
    "denote by @xmath173 the adjacency matrix for the @xmath56-th generation of the network . using the numbering given in fig.1",
    ", the adjacency matrix is defined by the following .",
    "@xmath174 @xmath175 and so forth . here",
    "all other blanks stand for zeros .",
    "we omit them just for seeing the sparse matrix structure corresponding to the network geometry of the dsfn .",
    "what is important here in the above is that the adjacency matrix for a certain generation of the network can be almost 3-block diagonal by those for the last generation of the network . from this , the fractal nature of the adjacency matrices for the dsfn is now very clear .",
    "let us consider the eigenvalue problem for the adjacency matrix in the dsfn .",
    "the eigenequation for the @xmath56-th generation of the network is given by @xmath176 @xmath177 where @xmath173 is the @xmath178 matrix and @xmath179 the @xmath180-dimensional vector with its transpose @xmath181 .",
    "this reduces to the following eigenvalue problem : @xmath182 = 0 ,                             \\eqno{(55)}\\ ] ] where @xmath183 stands for the @xmath178 unit matrix .",
    "denote by @xmath184 the determinant in the left hand side such that @xmath185 .",
    "\\eqno{(56)}\\ ] ] this can be formally expanded with respect to @xmath186 as @xmath187 @xmath188    we note the following : since the @xmath186 is an eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix @xmath173 , from the knowledge of linear algebra , we are able to derive the following : @xmath189 @xmath190    for example , we easily have the following : @xmath191 @xmath192 @xmath193 and so forth .",
    "as we will see later , all the terms of even number powers of @xmath186 vanish in the dsfn .",
    "this is attributed to the topology of the network .",
    "let us obtain the spectra of the adjacency matrices , discussed in the above .",
    "we use a computer calculation for this purpose .",
    "the calculated spectra for the adjacency matrix for each generation of the network are shown in fig.2 .",
    "-th the generation is shown for @xmath194 ( red ) ; @xmath195 ( pink ) ; @xmath196 ( green ) ; @xmath197 ( blue ) , respectively . ]    from the numerical results , we find the following very important characters of the spectra : ( i ) the maximum eigenvalue , @xmath198 , at the @xmath56-th generation of the network becomes the second largest eigenvalue , @xmath199 , at the @xmath200-th generation of the network .",
    "\\(ii ) similarly for the other eigenvalues , all the eigenvalues appeared at the previous generations of the network always exist in the eigenvalues appeared at the newly generation of the network .",
    "\\(iii ) _ the spectrum consists of highly degenerate levels_. for example , for @xmath194 there are three levels ( shown by red ) of @xmath201 with single degeneracy . for @xmath195",
    "there are nine levels ( shown by pink ) in the spectrum .",
    "there is only one peak at the center level of @xmath202 with degeneracy of @xmath203 and the other levels of @xmath204 are all single levels . for @xmath196",
    "there are 27 levels ( shown by green ) in the spectrum .",
    "there is a highest peak at the center level ( @xmath202 ) with degeneracy of @xmath205 .",
    "there are two peaks at the levels of @xmath206 with degeneracy of @xmath203 . and the other 12 levels are all single levels . for @xmath197",
    "there are 81 levels ( shown by blue ) in the spectrum .",
    "there is a highest peak at the center level ( @xmath202 ) with degeneracy of @xmath207 .",
    "there are two peaks at the levels of @xmath206 with degeneracy of @xmath205 .",
    "there are four peaks at the levels of @xmath206 with degeneracy of @xmath203 . and the other 24 levels are all single levels , and so forth .    in order to study this nature",
    "further , we have done numerical calculations for the spectra of the adjacency matrices with the sizes of @xmath208 , respectively . from this",
    "we have confirmed ourselves that this nature is numerically exact at any generation of the network up to @xmath209 .",
    "we show this in fig.3 for the cases of @xmath210 ( green ) , @xmath211(blue ) , @xmath212(red ) .",
    "-th the generation is shown for @xmath213 ( green ) ; @xmath214 ( blue ) ; @xmath215 ( red ) , respectively . ]",
    "the above nature is remarkable .",
    "it enables us to calculate the exact sequence of the degeneracies in the spectrum at any generation of the network , apart from finding the exact eigenvalues . by counting the numbers of the levels and its degeneracies , we find the following very important result .",
    "\\(iv ) let us denote @xmath216 the degeneracy of the @xmath169-th peak in the spectrum for the network of the @xmath56-th generation . denote by @xmath217 the number of the eigenvalues having the same degeneracy of @xmath216 .",
    "we find @xmath218 @xmath219    from this we can check whether or not the above formula is correct . for this purpose , we just reproduce the total number of eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix as follows .",
    "@xmath222 @xmath223 this is nothing but the total number of eigenvalues in the spectrum .",
    "hence , the formula is proved .    here",
    "we would like to point out the eigenvectors ( i.e. , the states ) corresponding to the eigenvalues as well .",
    "then we find the following very interesting character :    \\(v ) _ the eigenvectors ( i.e. , the states ) are very localized_. the states of @xmath202 first appeared in the network of the first generation are localized only on the pairs of leaf nodes such as the pair of 2 and 3 , the pair of 5 and 6 , and the pair of 8 and 9 , etc .",
    "the states of @xmath206 first appeared in the network of the first generation are localized only on the smallest triples centered at the root hub such as the triple of 1 , 2 , and 3 , the triple of 4 , 5 , and 6 , and the triple of 7 , 8 , and 9 , etc .",
    "the states of @xmath224 first appeared in the network of the second generation are localized within the subnetworks having the size of that of the second generation , such as the network of 1 - 9 , etc .",
    "the states of @xmath225 first appeared in the network of the third generation are localized within the subnetworks having the size of that of the second generation , such as the network of 1 - 27 , etc . and so forth .",
    "and the number of such subnetworks gives its degeneracy .",
    "thus , we find that the larger the eigenvalue the larger the extent of the eigenvector .",
    "hence , we would like to conclude that the eigenvector with the maximum eigenvalue ( say , @xmath226 ) is most delocalized while the eigenvalues of @xmath202 are extremely localized at the leaf nodes in the network .",
    "this nature explains the meaning of the spectrum shown in fig.s 2 and 3 .",
    "therefore , since we see similar spectra in most sfn models , we may expect that the same holds true for every sfn .",
    "this is a very interesting point in the study of sfns .",
    "we now show why so .",
    "we are going to treat analytically the above result in the previous section . to do this , let us consider some interesting nature of @xmath184 .",
    "let us first consider @xmath227 .",
    "@xmath228 we can calculate this and convert it as follows : @xmath229 @xmath230 obviously , this provides three eigenvalues of @xmath231 therefore , let us denote it as @xmath232 where @xmath233    let us next consider @xmath234 .",
    "it is given by @xmath235 where all blanks stand for zeros .",
    "doing the same procedure , we find @xmath236 @xmath237 @xmath238 hence , we obtain @xmath239 where @xmath240 @xmath241 in the same way , we find the following for the determinants @xmath242 and @xmath243 : @xmath244 @xmath245 @xmath246 @xmath247 @xmath248 @xmath249 @xmath250 @xmath251 and so forth",
    ". thus , we obtain a series of irreducible polynomials as follows : @xmath252 @xmath253 @xmath254 @xmath255 @xmath256 @xmath257 @xmath258 using these polynomials , we are able to represent the sequence of the determinants as follows : @xmath259 @xmath260 @xmath261 @xmath262 etc . , where @xmath263 is an even function of @xmath264-th order polynomial of @xmath186 such that @xmath265 .",
    "this symmetry in the eigenvalues is due to the bipartite nature of the dsfn .",
    "therefore , we expect that we can carry out such a factorization of the determinant at any generation of the network . hence , we are led to state the following conjectures .    for the polynomial with even suffix of @xmath266",
    ", it is always factorized as @xmath267 where @xmath268 and @xmath269 are @xmath12-th order polynomials of @xmath186 .",
    "@xmath270 @xmath271    the meaning of the second conjecture is now very clear .",
    "( 1 ) the spectrum is symmetrical around the center level of @xmath272 ( see fig.2 and fig.3 ) .",
    "this means that if @xmath186 is an eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix , then so if for @xmath273 .",
    "( 2 ) the powers in eq.(78 ) represent the numbers of the degeneracies of the eigenvalues .",
    "for example , the @xmath272 level consists of @xmath274 ( i.e. , the degeneracy of @xmath274 ) and this corresponds to the highest peak at the center of @xmath272 in the spectrum .",
    "the @xmath275 levels consist of @xmath276 ( i.e. , the degeneracy of @xmath276 ) and these correspond to the second highest peaks at the center of @xmath277 in the spectrum , and so forth .",
    "this proves the formulas of eq.s ( 61 ) and ( 62 ) , previously found .    the validity of the conjectures is also supported by our numerical calculations as mentioned before . but the exact proofs have not been made yet , however .",
    "we now consider zeros ( i.e. , roots ) of the irreducible polynomials of @xmath263 for @xmath278 . as studied before , the order of @xmath263 is @xmath264 and it is a function of @xmath279 .",
    "let us denote as @xmath280 .",
    "then , @xmath263 becomes a function of @xmath281 such as @xmath282 .",
    "now we have the following :    @xmath283 @xmath284 @xmath285 @xmath286 @xmath287 and so forth .",
    "since @xmath282 is now a @xmath264-th order polynomial of @xmath281 , it has to consist of @xmath264 zeros .",
    "then the meaning of irreducibility is the following : @xmath282 ( @xmath288 ) does not share common roots with the other generations of the polynomials .",
    "this can be proved by the sturm theorem for polynomials.@xcite .    from the knowledge of algebra ,",
    "if there is a series of the irreducible polynomials , then the roots of the polynomial of order @xmath289 always exist in the intervals between the roots of the polynomial of order @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , the maximum root of the polynomial of order @xmath56 exceeds that of order @xmath289 . in our problem ,",
    "the irreducible polynomial @xmath263 is of order @xmath264 and it gives the newly appearing eigenvalues .",
    "therefore , there are @xmath264 eigenvalues in the network of the @xmath56-th generation .    on the other hand ,",
    "the previously appeared eigenvalues are given as the roots of the irreducible polynomials of order up to @xmath289 , i.e. , @xmath290 .",
    "therefore , there are @xmath291 eigenvalues already in the spectrum .",
    "thus , the number of newly appearing eigenvalues is exactly one more than that of the previously existed eigenvalues .",
    "hence , by the knowledge of algebra , the eigenvalues of the network of the @xmath56-th generation sandwiches the previously existed eigenvalues such that the maximum eigenvalue may exceed that of the previous generation . as we iterate the network , @xmath56 becomes large indefinitely .",
    "therefore , the maximum eigenvalue develops further .    to understand this point further ,",
    "we have numerically investigated the ratio @xmath292 between the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath293 at the @xmath56-th generation and that of @xmath294 at the @xmath295-th generation up to @xmath296 .",
    "denote the ratio by @xmath297 .",
    "the result is as follows : @xmath298 from this we see that as @xmath56 becomes large the ratio tends to the number @xmath299 .",
    "thus , we are led to the following conjecture :    as @xmath52 , @xmath300    this conjecture can be proved from the nature of the series of the irreducible polynomials in eq.(75 ) .",
    "let us first consider the case of @xmath301 even . as we have discussed conjecture 1 , if @xmath302 even , then the polynomial can be factorized as @xmath303 @xmath304 @xmath305 where @xmath306 therefore , the maximum eigenvalue is given by @xmath307 dividing the above polynomial by @xmath308 yields @xmath309 since @xmath310 as @xmath52 , we can obtain the approximation of the maximum eigenvalue by a perturbation method .",
    "hence , for @xmath302 even , we obtain @xmath311 such that @xmath312 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath302 odd , then we can apply the same perturbational argument to the irreducible polynomial , then we have @xmath313 where @xmath314 and @xmath280 .",
    "hence , we obtain @xmath315 such that @xmath316 .",
    "this argument supports the conjecture .",
    "thus , we expect that as @xmath52 @xmath317 .    in this way",
    ", the solution of the series of the irreducible polynomials is very crucial in finding the spectrum of the dsfn .",
    "this point is supported by our numerical calculations before .",
    "let us consider a particular nature of the dsfn .",
    "there is a hidden symmetry in the adjacency matrix , @xmath173 . to see this point",
    "let us consider the case of @xmath318 .",
    "as was discussed before , the adjacency matrix for this case is given by eq.(52 ) and the eigenvalue problem is @xmath319 this expression depends on the choice of the arrangement of components of the eigenvector @xmath320 where @xmath321 means its transpose . reminding ourselves of the bipartite nature of the dsfn , we can rearrange them as follows : @xmath322 this means that we align the vector - components numbering in @xmath323 .",
    "then we find the following : @xmath324 where all blanks stand for zeros .",
    "therefore , we can write it as @xmath325 where @xmath326 and @xmath327 are the @xmath203 and @xmath328-dimensional vectors , and @xmath329 and @xmath330 are zero matrices , and @xmath331 @xmath332 here , @xmath333 and @xmath334 , respectively .",
    "this is just a interchange of the vector components .",
    "therefore , if there is no confusion between @xmath335 and @xmath336 , we can simply write @xmath335 as @xmath336 .",
    "so , we identify them as the original adjacency matrix @xmath336 , below .    from eq.(91 ) , we leads to the following : @xmath337 from this we find by simple algebra @xmath338 where @xmath339 is the @xmath203-dimensional matrix and @xmath340 the @xmath328-dimensional matrix .",
    "these are given by @xmath341 @xmath342 @xmath343 @xmath344    let us solve the eigenvalue problem of eq.(96 ) .",
    "in this case , the first eigenvalue problem , @xmath345 , gives the determinant @xmath346 where @xmath280 . by simple algebra ,",
    "we show the following : @xmath347 @xmath348 @xmath349 hence , the determinant @xmath350 gives the three eigenvalues of @xmath351 , @xmath352 , as expected .",
    "similarly , the second eigenvalue problem , @xmath353 , gives the determinant @xmath354 subtracting the first column by the fourth column , the second column by the fifth column , and the third column by the sixth column , respectively , we obtain @xmath355 @xmath356 and as the next step add the first row to the fourth row , the second row to the fifth row , and the third row to the sixth row , we obtain @xmath357 @xmath358 @xmath359 @xmath360 hence , the determinant @xmath361 gives the six eigenvalues of @xmath362 ( triple ) , @xmath363 , @xmath352 , as expected .",
    "we would like to note that the factors seen in eq.s ( 99 ) and ( 102 ) are nothing but the irreducible functions @xmath364 and @xmath365 , found before .",
    "let us consider some interesting character in eq.(91 ) .",
    "since @xmath366 , we find that @xmath367 where @xmath368 @xmath369 hence , the square @xmath370 of the original adjacency matrix @xmath336 for the dsfn can be block - diagonal . since from eq.(103 ) we have @xmath371 , this eigenvalue problem provides the following : @xmath372 = \\det \\left[a_{2 } - \\lambda i_{2}\\right ] \\det \\left[a_{2 } + \\lambda i_{2}\\right]\\ ] ] @xmath373\\right|^{2}\\ ] ] @xmath374 \\det \\left[m_{2 } m_{2}^{\\dagger } - \\lambda^{2 } i_{2}\\right ] .        \\eqno{(105)}\\ ] ] therefore , the original determinant @xmath234 of eq.(69 ) is given by @xmath375\\right|^{1/2 } \\left|\\det \\left[m_{2 } m_{2}^{\\dagger } - \\lambda^{2 } i_{2}\\right]\\right|^{1/2}\\ ] ] @xmath376 substituting eq.s ( 99 ) and ( 102 ) into eq.(106 ) , we obtain @xmath377 this reproduces eq.(76 ) .",
    "now , we are able to generalize the above procedure to the adjacency matrix @xmath173 for the dsfn at any generation . in this case",
    "( 91 ) is generalized to @xmath378 this then yields @xmath379 here @xmath326 and @xmath327 are the @xmath380- and @xmath381-dimensional vectors , @xmath382 and @xmath383 the @xmath384 and @xmath385 zero matrices , and @xmath386 and @xmath387 the @xmath388 and @xmath389 matrices , respectively , where @xmath390 and @xmath391 .",
    "then , in the same way we have the following : @xmath392\\right|^{1/2 } \\left|\\det \\left[m_{n } m_{n}^{\\dagger } - \\lambda^{2}i_{n}\\right]\\right|^{1/2}\\ ] ] @xmath393^{1/2 } ,       \\eqno{(110)}\\ ] ] where @xmath394 and @xmath395 [ @xmath396 are factorized in terms of the irreducible polynomials of eq.(79 ) .",
    "therefore , eq.(107 ) may reduce to the form of eq.(75 ) .",

    "therefore , the null space of @xmath402 is given by the difference between the dimension of the matrix @xmath402 and that of the matrix @xmath399 .",
    "this is @xmath413 .",

    "let us consider the nature of the maximum eigenvalue . as we studied",
    "before , the matrix @xmath399 absolutely determines the spectrum of @xmath414 , while the matrix @xmath402 determines the zero modes of @xmath202 as well as the spectrum .",

    "hence the maximum diagonal element is the maximum degrees of node , which is the degree of the root .",
    "it is @xmath419 from eq.(7 ) .",
    "let us first derive the lower bound of the maximum eigenvalue , @xmath23 . in mathematics",

    "to do so , let us first consider a particular property of the matrix , @xmath387 . as is seen from the matrix such as eq.(93 ) , the @xmath15-th column vector of @xmath387 are a vector whose components are @xmath170 or @xmath171 such that the total number of @xmath171 in the column counts the order @xmath14 of the @xmath15-th hub node .",

    "our theorem provides us the lower bound @xmath469 and the upper bound @xmath470 . from this",

    "we show this behavior using the above exact expressions in fig.5 .",
    "as is shown in fig.4 , the numerical value of @xmath23 is sandwiched between the upper bound of @xmath7 and the lower bound of @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , it follows the chung , lu , and vu s theorem within our calculation up to @xmath296 .",
    "unfortunately , the numerical value of @xmath23 is not available above @xmath296 because of the ability of our computer power .",
    "so , we can not say anything about where it is located above @xmath296 , so far .",

    "the maximum order of nodes @xmath24 , and the maximum degree @xmath67 .",
    "clearly , we see that @xmath24 is smaller than @xmath67 but very close to it under @xmath472 . however , @xmath24 exceeds @xmath67 about @xmath472 . ]",
    "in conclusion , we have intensively studied the dsfn that was first studied by barabsi , ravasz , and vicsek@xcite .",
    "we have first studied the geometry of the network and presented the exact numbers of nodes and degrees . from these",
    "we were able to calculate the exact scaling exponents for the hub and rim nodes , where we have shown that the scaling nature of the hubs is a scale - free law but that of the rims is not so but the exponential .",
    "this is obtained only when we have known the exact numbers of the nodes and degrees .",
    "so , the scaling behaviors of the hub and rim nodes are different .",
    "in some sense we may say that the dsfn is more like a multifractal .",
    "this nature has not found yet by barabsi , ravasz , and vicsek@xcite .",
    "second , we have analytically calculated the exact number of the second order average degree @xmath7 [ see eq.(49 ) ] , using the numbers of the nodes and degrees .",
    "this quantity has been frequently used in the criterion for investigating the bounds of the maximum eigenvalue @xmath23 of a sfn as chung , lu , and vu@xcite have been emphasizing .",
    "however , there has been no example of a rigorous result .",
    "so , this would be a first example of the analytically calculated quantity , @xmath7 .",
    "third , we have numerically calculated the spectra of the adjacency matrix @xmath173 for the network up to the @xmath35-th generation . from this",
    "we have counted the exact numbers of degeneracies in the spectrum , and have shown that the density of states looks like a fractal , where there is a large peak at the center of the spectrum of @xmath202 [ see fig.2 and fig.3 ] .",
    "such degeneracies are related to the degree of the localization of the state ( i.e. , the eigenvector ) .",
    "as the eigenvalue becomes larger the state becomes broader ( i.e. , delocalized ) , where the minimum eigenvalues of @xmath202 are localized on the minimum connected rim nodes .",
    "the envelope of the density of states in the dsfn is somehow similar to that of the spectral shape in the ab - model@xcite .",
    "so , we expect that the origin of localization in the ab - model may be the same or similar to that in the dsfn that we have studied here .",
    "fourth , we have discussed the nature of the adjacency matrix for the network .",
    "we have shown that there is a recursive structure of the determinant , which induces to the complex structure of degeneracy .",
    "the sequence of the irreducible polynomial seems very important .",
    "this would be related to a new type of functions .",
    "the roots of the polynomials and their irreducibility may be a problem of the sturm theorem in algebra .",
    "therefore , this will be an interesting problem for mathematicians .",
    "fifth , we have shown that there is a hidden symmetry in the adjacency matrix .",
    "this is the consequence of a bipartite structure of the network . from this nature",
    ", the adjacency matrix is decomposed into the off - diagonal type .",
    "then we have proved an index theorem for the network for the first time .",
    "this theorem has enabled us to count the number of zero modes exactly .",
    "this type of theory is very well - known in the quantum field theory@xcite .",
    "it is known as the supersymmetric structure . and it has been also known in solid state physics from a long time ago@xcite .",
    "the number of zero modes is related to the number of localized states in the system .",
    "therefore , we expect that this may be the case in other network systems",
    ". this will be a very important problem .",
    "finally , we have investigated the maximum eigenvalue , @xmath23 in the dsfn .",
    "we have shown that @xmath23 is bounded by the lower and upper bounds that are given analytically [ see theorem 7 ] .",
    "these bounds grow as fast as exponential as the network grows .",
    "hence , by the theorem , @xmath23 grows exponential as well .",
    "this might be also a first example for the determination of the exact bounds . in the standard networks such as the random networks@xcite",
    ", the maximum eigenvalue can not grow so fast as the network grows . and also ,",
    "as in solid state physics , networks in most of physical systems provide the so - called energy band that is a spectrum with a finite region .",
    "this is due to the topology of the finite coordination number of atoms in the network of the lattice structure .",
    "so , in order to elucidate the difference between the sfns and other networks the growth of the maximum eigenvalue is an important signature .",
    "as was studied by many authors@xcite , the behavior of @xmath23 in the ab - model is believed to be proportional to @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , since @xmath26 is propotional to @xmath474 , hence , @xmath475 . to see whether or not this is true in an arbitrary sfn and to know how general it is , chung , lu , and vu@xcite established the theorem .",
    "however , as we have shown , @xmath23 in the dsfn that we have studied in this paper seems to escape from the region of their theorem .",
    "therefore , our example will be a counter example for their theorem . whether or not this is true will be an interesting problem for further study .",
    "thus , we believe that our theory presented in this paper gives the first rigorous example in the sfn theory , where most of all quantities in the network theory are analytically obtained . in this context , we would like to call the dsfn the exactly solvable sfn model .",

    "<S> we first derive the exact numbers @xmath0 of nodes with degree @xmath1 for the hub and rim nodes in each generation of the network , respectively . using this , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the exact exponents of the distribution function @xmath0 of nodes with @xmath1 degree in the asymptotic limit of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the degree distribution for the hub nodes exhibits the scale - free nature , @xmath3 with @xmath4 , while the degree distribution for the rim nodes is given by @xmath5 with @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> second , we analytically calculate the second order average degree of nodes , @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> third , we numerically as well as analytically calculate the spectra of the adjacency matrix @xmath8 for representing topology of the network . </S>",
    "<S> we also analytically obtain the exact number of degeneracy at each eigenvalue in the network . the density of states ( i.e. , the distribution function of eigenvalues ) exhibits the fractal nature with respect to the degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> fourth , we study the mathematical structure of the determinant of the eigenequation for the adjacency matrix . </S>",
    "<S> fifth , we study hidden symmetry , zero modes and its index theorem in the deterministic scale - free network . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we study the nature of the maximum eigenvalue in the spectrum of the deterministic scale - free network . </S>",
    "<S> we will prove several theorems for it , using some mathematical theorems . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we show that most of all important quantities in the network theory can be analytically obtained in the deterministic scale - free network model of barabsi , ravasz and vicsek . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we may call this network model the exactly solvable scale - free network . </S>"
