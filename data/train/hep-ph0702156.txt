    "even though the standard model(sm)@xcite has been successful in describing the strong , weak and electromagnetic interaction phenomena at the energy scale up to @xmath7 gev , it has been known for a long time that it is still considered as a low - energy effective theory suffering from a number of theoretical difficulties , such as hierarchy problem .",
    "it is likely that at the higher energy scale the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite is the most attractive candidate among various extensions of the sm , which is expected to resolve theoretical difficulties existing in the sm . by adopting two higgs doublets to preserve the supersymmetry in the mssm , five higgs bosons are predicted .",
    "they are two cp - even higgs scalar bosons @xmath8 and @xmath9 , one cp - odd higgs boson @xmath10 and a charged higgs pair @xmath11 .",
    "the charged higgs boson plays an important role in the extensions of the sm , its discovery in experiment will unequivocally imply the existence of the physics beyond the sm .",
    "if the charged higgs boson really exists in nature then it is mostly possible to be discovered in the coming few years at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) due to its tev scale colliding energy , but the further accurate measurements of masses of higgs bosons and investigations of the properties of higgs bosons@xcite , which is crucial for verification of electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking mechanism , need be best performed in a clean environment of @xmath12 collisions , such as at the future international linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite .",
    "the study would be of the utmost importance for establishment of the mssm or some of more general supersymmetric models as the theory of the ew interactions .",
    "in addition , further study of the complete higgs spectrum is the cornerstone of the definitive test of mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking . in discovery and detailed study of the properties for these higgs bosons , there are some important processes for neutral and charged higgs bosons at linear colliders , such as , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and so on@xcite .",
    "the lightest neutral higgs boson @xmath8 in the mssm has the mass upper limit of about @xmath17 , and it decays dominantly into @xmath18 pairs . for the heavier neutral higgs bosons @xmath19 , as a result of the strong enhancement of the coupling between higgs boson and down - type fermions , both @xmath9 and @xmath10 will decay almost exclusively into @xmath18 ( @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) pairs ( the decays @xmath23 are possible only when they are kinematically allowed ) , and on the contrary all other decays are strongly suppressed@xcite . for the mass of charged higgs boson being blow @xmath24 ( i.e. , the @xmath25 decay threshold ) , the dominant decay mode of the charged higgs boson is @xmath26 .",
    "but when the mass of charged higgs boson is above the @xmath25 decay threshold , the charged @xmath11 boson mainly decays into @xmath27 pair leading to @xmath28 final states@xcite .    if @xmath29 pair production at @xmath12 linear colliders(lc ) is kinematically allowed , the dominant production process of charged higgs bosons is the pair production via exchanging a virtual photon and @xmath30 boson @xmath31@xcite . for a fixed @xmath12 colliding energy ,",
    "its cross section is related only with the charged higgs boson mass .",
    "another important production mode is the production of single charged higgs boson , especially when the charged higgs boson is too heavy to be produced in pair at linear colliders . among various single",
    "charged higgs boson production channels , the bottom quark associated production process of @xmath32@xcite is experimentally interesting since it can be yielded by many topologies , such as the @xmath33 and @xmath29 pair productions followed by their corresponding sequential decays .",
    "the @xmath34 process can be also induced from following three single charged higgs boson production processes ( [ process ] ) and the sequential decays @xmath35 , @xmath36    s. kanemura , s. moretti , _ et al , _ studied the processes of single charged higgs boson production channels in the mssm at lcs , including the processes ( [ process ] ) at tree - level in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was found that there are regions of parameter space where it is accessible beyond the kinematic limit for pair production , and these processes are excellent channels in studying the interactions among neutral higgs boson(@xmath8 , @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) , charged higgs boson and gauge boson(@xmath1 ) , and is a useful alternative channel for studying the phenomenology of charged higgs boson .    in present work",
    ", we will study the ew corrections to the processes ( [ process ] ) including complete one - loop diagrams in the mssm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect.2 , we present the analytical calculation of the complete one - loop ew radiative corrections to @xmath37 processes in the mssm as well as the treatment of charged higgs boson resonance . the numerical results and discussions are given in sect.3 .",
    "finally , we give a short summary .",

    "kinematical momentum of the incoming positron , the integration is performed over the three - body phase space of final particles @xmath41 , the bar over summation indicates averaging over initial spins .",
    "the phase - space element @xmath42 is defined by @xmath43    in our calculation , we use dimensional reduction(dr ) regularization scheme , which is supersymmetric invariant at least one - loop level , to regularize uv divergences and adopt on - shell(os ) conditions(neglecting the finite widths of the particle ) to renormalize the relevant fields@xcite .",
    "we adopt the t hooft - feynman gauge and the definitions of one - loop integral functions in ref.@xcite in the calculation of one - loop diagrams .",
    "the feynman diagrams and their corresponding amplitudes are created by @xmath44 @xcite automatically , and the feynman amplitudes are subsequently reduced by @xmath45@xcite .",
    "we depict the lowest - order feynman diagrams in fig.1 .",
    "the numerical calculation of the two- , three- and four - point integral functions are done by using ff package@xcite .",
    "the implementations of the scalar and the tensor five - point integrals are carried out exactly by using the fortran programs as used in our previous works@xcite with the approach presented in ref.@xcite . due to the fact that the yukawa coupling of higgs / goldstone to the fermions is proportional to the mass of the fermion",
    ", we ignore the contributions of the feynman diagrams which involve the yukawa coupling between any higgs / goldstone boson and electrons .    .",
    "]    the @xmath46 virtual correction to the cross section can be expressed as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the renormalized amplitude involving all the one - loop electroweak feynman diagrams and corresponding counter - terms@xcite .        ]",
    "the disposal of @xmath56 resonance in the calculation of the ew correction is similar with the method described in ref.@xcite . for the process",
    "@xmath57 in @xmath58 scale colliding energy , the amplitude of the feynman diagram with internal line of @xmath56(shown in fig.2(a ) , denoted as @xmath59 ) suffers from resonance effect when @xmath60 due to the real charged higgs boson decay @xmath61 .",
    "we have to introduce the complex @xmath56 mass to do the following replacement in the resonance propagator of the amplitude @xmath59 , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is @xmath56 decay width",

    ", we separate some special feynman diagrams(shown in fig.2(b ) ) from entirety .",
    "each of these diagrams in fig.2(b ) contains a one - loop of charged higgs boson self - energy , or the corresponding counterterm .",
    "then we can express the one - loop level amplitude as below : @xmath67_{\\frac{1}{s_{34}-m_{h^-}^2 } \\to \\frac{1}{s_{34}-m_{h^-}^2+i m_{h^-}\\gamma_{h^- } } } { \\nonumber}\\\\ & & -\\left[\\frac{\\sigma^{h^-h^-}(s_{34})-\\left[\\sigma^{h^-h^-}(m_{h^-}^2)-b_{a^0a^0}\\right]}{s_{34}-m_{h^-}^2 } + \\delta z_{h^-h^- } \\right]{\\cal m}_{tree}^{h^-},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term on right - handed side is just the amplitude at one - loop level after subtracting the the contributions of fig.2(b ) .",
    "the one - loop(or higher ) order contributions are included by doing the replacement shown in eq.([replace ] ) .",
    "the real part of @xmath68 is just equal to @xmath69 , the mass counterterm of charged higgs boson , while @xmath68 receives its imaginary part in the resonance from the subtraction of the @xmath70 contribution already contained in @xmath71 . in the calculation ,",
    "charged higgs boson width was evaluated using the hdecay package@xcite , and uv divergence cancelled numerically .",
    "the @xmath46 virtual correction suffers from both ultraviolet(uv ) and infrared(ir ) divergences .",
    "it is checked numerically that the uv divergence vanished after renormalization .",
    "ir divergence comes from virtual photonic loop correction .",
    "it can be cancelled by the contribution of the real photon emission processes .",
    "we denote the real photon emission as @xmath72 we adopt the general phase - space - slicing method @xcite to separate the soft photon emission singularity from the real photon emission processes . by using this method ,",
    "the bremsstrahlung phase space is divided into singular and non - singular regions by the soft photon cutoff @xmath73 , then the relative correction of the real photon emission is broken down into corresponding soft term @xmath74 with radiated photon energy @xmath75 and hard terms @xmath76 with @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 is the mass of photon , which is used to regulate the ir divergences existing in the soft term .",
    "the ir divergence from the soft contribution cancels that from the virtual correction exactly@xcite .",
    "therefore , the sum of the virtual and soft cross section is independent of the ir regulator @xmath79 . in the calculation ,",

    "the hard photon emission cross section @xmath82 is uv and ir finite with @xmath83 .",
    "finally , we can get the uv and ir finite @xmath84 correction .",
    "in the numerical calculation , we use the following sm parameters @xcite @xmath85 here we take the effective values of the light quark masses @xmath86 and @xmath87 which can reproduce the hadronic contribution to the shift in the fine structure constant @xmath88 @xcite . as a numerical demonstration , we generally adopt the relevant supersymmetric parameters from the cp and r - parity invariant mssm reference point @xmath2 which is defined in the spa project@xcite .",
    "this point satisfies all the available high- and low - energy precision data and both the bounds for the masses of the susy particles and the bounds from cosmology .",
