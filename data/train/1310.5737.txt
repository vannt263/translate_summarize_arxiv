    "considerable interest has been recently devoted in finding exact solutions to schrdinger equations involving known potentials when the mass is position - dependent ( pdm ) . among them",
    ", one may mention the morse and coulomb potentials @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been recently shown @xcite that to lowest order of perturbation theory , there exists a whole class of hermitian position - dependent - mass hamiltonians that are associated with pseudo - hermitian hamiltonians .",
    "a great deal of interest has been paid to the interplay between these pseudo - hermitian pt - symmetric hamiltonians and their equivalent hermitian representations @xcite . in particular , mostafazadeh @xcite has considered the transition to the classical limit by showing that the relevant classical hamiltonian for the pt - symmetric cubic anharmonic oscillator plus a harmonic term , produces a behavior similar to a point particle with position - dependent - mass interacting with a quartic harmonic oscillator .    indeed , many physical settings exist in which the effective mass can in principle depend on position .",
    "for example , wang et al .",
    "@xcite have recently shown that the schrdinger equation for a thin charged shell moving under the influence of its own gravitational field may be viewed as a position - dependent - mass problem .",
    "displacement operators have already been introduced for systems with position - dependent - mass , for null or constant potentials from which generalized forms of the momentum operator have been obtained @xcite .    in this contribution",
    ", we demonstrate the possibility of transforming via similarity transformations , a position dependent mass hamiltonian into a hamiltonian with constant ( unity ) mass . by doing so",
    ", these hamiltonians can then be solved ( if integrable ) using well - known techniques from quantum mechanics .",
    "if on the other hand the potentials are not solvable , perturbative methods may be applied for their solution . in order to achieve this objective , we use aspects associated with some non - classical states of the harmonic oscillator , namely , squeezed states @xcite . for squeezed states ,",
    "the uncertainty may be `` squeezed '' in one of the quadratures , while in the other canonical conjugate variable the uncertainty increases .",
    "in what follows , we will first show how the constant mass may be eliminated from the kinetic energy in a hamiltonian . in this regard , consider the hamiltonian @xmath0 where the mass particle is @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this hamiltonian is in turn transformed using the squeeze unitary operator @xcite @xmath3.\\ ] ] to find how the operator @xmath4 transforms the position and the momentum operators , the hadamard lemma @xcite is used ; i.e. , that @xmath5 + \\frac{1}{2!}\\left [ \\hat{a},\\left [ \\hat{a},\\hat{b}\\right ] \\right]+ \\frac{1}{3!}\\left [ \\hat{a},\\left [ \\hat{a},\\left [ \\hat{a},\\hat{b}\\right]\\right ] \\right]+ ... $ ] , from which we obtain that @xmath6 as a result , the transformed hamiltonian takes the form @xmath7 and thus the mass has been effectively eliminated from the kinetic energy term . based on this latter possibility",
    ", one could ask if the mass can also be eliminated from the kinetic energy via a proper transformation , even if it is position dependent .",
    "there is always some uncertainty as to the actual form of the kinetic energy term in a hamiltonian , when the mass is position dependent .",
    "this is because @xmath8 no longer commutes with the momentum .",
    "there are consequently several ways to write the kinetic part of the hamiltonian that must be kept hermitian ; for instance @xmath9 on the other hand , by choosing @xmath10 , we arrive to the ordering proposed by bendaniel and duke @xcite , @xmath11 while with the choice @xmath12 , @xmath13 , we get @xmath14.\\ ] ] although there is no apparent reason in selecting any particular ordering for the kinetic position - dependent - mass hamiltonian , here we will choose to work with the bendaniel and duke proposal .",
    "physical arguments supporting this choice were put forward by lvy - leblond @xcite .",
    "we now consider the complete quantum hamiltonian of a particle with position - dependent mass @xmath15 we then use the transformation @xmath16 with @xmath17 \\right\\rbrace,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is a well behaved function that will depend on position .",
    "using the hadamard lemma @xcite , one can show that the momentum operator transforms according to @xmath19,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 for which @xmath21 on the other hand , for the position operator , we obtain @xmath22 where @xmath23 with @xmath24 from equation ( [ 11 ] ) , we note that @xmath25 from the above equations , we can then write @xmath26 where the transformed potential @xmath27 is given by @xmath28,\\ ] ] and where @xmath29 up to this point , we have succeeded in eliminating the position dependency of the mass .",
    "note that both hamiltonians , @xmath30 and @xmath31 have the same sets of eigenvalues since they are related by a similarity transformation .",
    "therefore , by finding the eigenvalues of @xmath31 we can directly obtain the eigenvalues corresponding to the position dependent mass hamiltonian @xmath30 .",
    "let us consider a mass that decays with the position in an exponential - like fashion ; i.e. , let @xmath32 figure 1 , depicts this mass dependence on position when @xmath33 , and for three different values of the parameter @xmath34 .    ) for @xmath33 , and @xmath35 . ]",
    "this particular dependence of the mass on position suggests the auxiliary function @xmath36 , in which case the similarity transformation takes the form @xmath37 .\\ ] ] from here one finds that @xmath38 and @xmath39 that is consistent with @xmath40 .",
    "+ with this particular choice for a position dependent mass ( [ 20 ] ) , we also choose the following potential @xmath41 with real arbitrary coefficients . if @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , the transformed potential function @xmath27 is given by the morse potential @xmath45 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 and @xmath47 . + in figure 2 , we plot the original potential ( [ 24 ] ) as a function of the position for the same values as in figure 1 , when @xmath48 .    ) for @xmath33 , @xmath35 , and @xmath48 . ]",
    "the solution of the transformed equation , can now be obtained given that the mass is constant and the potential involved is of the morse type that is known to admit analytical solutions .",
    "by means of a squeeze - like unitary transformation , we have related a position dependent mass hamiltonian to a hamiltonian with constant mass . by doing so",
    ", we can use standard methods for analyzing quantum mechanical problems of this type .",
    "importantly , the eigenvalues of the transformed hamiltonian are the same as those associated with the original position dependent problem .",
    "meanwhile the eigenfunctions of these two hamiltonians are related by a similarity transformation - given by the squeeze - like operator ( [ 10 ] ) .",
