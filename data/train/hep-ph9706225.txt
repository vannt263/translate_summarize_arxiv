    "the top quark physics@xcite is one of the most interesting targets in the near future @xmath10 linear collider experiments@xcite .",
    "since the top quark mass is around 174 gev@xcite , by the linear colliders at the energy @xmath11 gev the top physics can be studied precisely .",
    "for example , due to the large top decay width , @xmath3 decays into @xmath12 without non perturbative qcd interaction at the long distance .",
    "this means that the study of perturbative qcd can be done clearly by using the @xmath2 production process@xcite .",
    "so far , the investigation of the top quark physics at the future @xmath10 linear colliders has made a great progress both from the theoretical and experimental points of view . at the @xmath8 threshold region ,",
    "the @xmath2 cross section is expected to depend on several parameters as follows : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the top yukawa coupling .",
    "et al . _ have studied quantitatively on the determination of above physical parameters under the realistic conditions .",
    "a precise @xmath2 cross section scan was discussed including the initial state radiation , beamstrahlung , and beam energy spread@xcite . above the @xmath2 threshold region",
    ", the future @xmath10 linear colliders can provide opportunities to investigate a new physics related the top quark .",
    "for example , the studies on the top quark couplings have been made by comas _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 pair production process decays mainly into : 6-jets ( @xmath15 ) , 4-jets plus 1 charged lepton ( @xmath16 ) , and 2-jets plus 2 charged leptons ( @xmath17 ) , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 . in this paper we concentrated on the second , the semi - leptonic process @xmath9",
    "this semi - leptonic ( 4-jets plus 1 charged lepton ) process has several advantages in the event selection for the top quark physics both at the @xmath8 threshold region and above .",
    "firstly , since the semi - leptonic process has less than 6-jets , it is less suffered from the backgrounds due to the wrong combination of jets .",
    "secondly , these semi - leptonic events are produced with enough statistics because @xmath21 is about 44% and @xmath22 is 45% after qcd correction .",
    "moreover , when we use the electric charge of the lepton as tag , we can identify the hemisphere where 3-jets , the decay products of the top quark , appear .    although the main contribution to the total cross section at @xmath1 = 340 - 500 gev comes from the diagrams through the @xmath8 production , those from the other diagrams are not negligible small at all . to study the @xmath2 production process precisely , an accurate estimation of the other diagrams is essentially required .",
    "we have calculated the cross section of @xmath9 process with a full set of feynman diagrams , 232 diagrams in unitary gauge .",
    "generally speaking , as the number of final state particles increases , the calculation of the cross section becomes more complicated and more tedious because there exist a lot of feynman diagrams and there occur interferences among these diagrams . in order to cope with this complex calculation",
    ", we have used an automatic feynman diagrams calculation package , grace@xcite .",
    "all the results obtained for the process @xmath23 are immediately applicable to the other semi - leptonic processes such as @xmath24 when we neglect the difference of mass between @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "in addition to an accurate calculation of the total cross section , the effects of interferences among diagrams have been studied .",
    "these interferences change the @xmath27 threshold shape destructively .",
    "also we present the invariant mass and angular distributions of the final state particles at @xmath1=500 gev . in order to enhance the signals of @xmath2 production process against the background , we studied on the effective cuts in the invariant mass distributions such as @xmath28 and @xmath29 and the cut for the angle of the final lepton in these distributions .",
    "recently , the similar calculations of @xmath30 six fermions are performed by two groups .",
    "et al._@xcite reported a full calculation of the six - fermion process in the @xmath10 linear colliders , where the higgs boson with the intermediate mass are produced , by the program package alpha@xcite for the matrix elements calculations and higgspv / wwgenpv@xcite for monte carlo event generation .",
    "et al._@xcite have been calculating a semi - leptonic process such as @xmath31 by program package phact@xcite .    in section 2",
    ", we present the details of the computational parameters for the calculations in grace at first .",
    "secondly , the numerical results are shown : the total cross sections ( section 2.1 ) , effects of the interferences among diagrams ( section 2.2 ) , and the mass and angular distributions of interest ( section 2.3 ) .",
    "the cross sections have been calculated based on a complete set of the tree level diagrams using grace system , a program package for an automatic feynman diagram calculation and the event generation . when the initial and final states are specified , grace generates the matrix elements in terms of helicity amplitudes .",
    "the total cross section is computed by the monte carlo integration of the matrix elements over the phase space@xcite . as for the kinematics",
    ", we only have to prepare the suitable program code to the physics process of interest .",
    "usually , as the number of the final state particles increases , it becomes more and more difficult to prepare such a program code of kinematics that may catch every singularities appeared in all diagrams and give a good convergence of the multidimensional monte carlo integration .",
    "we have developed a kinematics code for the process @xmath9 , which makes the calculation of the total cross sections converge rapidly enough to a good accuracy of better than 1 % at @xmath32 gev .    the cross sections has been calculated with the parameters shown in table 1 .",
    "the widths of @xmath33 and @xmath34 bosons are taken to be the fixed values . the qcd correction is not included in the calculations .",
    "the quark masses are set as in table 2 .",
    "the @xmath3 quark width of 1.558 gev corresponds to the decay width of @xmath35 , which means that the decay branching ratio of @xmath35 channel is 100% .",
    "the total cross section of @xmath36 process is calculated to be @xmath37 pb at cm energy of 500 gev by grace .",
    "this is consistent with the cross section of @xmath38 processes of @xmath39 pb calculated by grace .",
    "the cross section of @xmath9 process only with the @xmath8 production diagrams is calculated to be @xmath40 pb ( in table 3 ) and is also consistent with @xmath41 pb . here",
    ", we took @xmath42 = 100 % .      among all 232 diagrams ( unitary gauge ) of the process ,",
    "the @xmath8 production diagrams of fig.1 are dominant over the others .",
    "we have divided the _",
    "major background diagrams _ into three categories : the diagrams with @xmath43 ( hereafter @xmath44 ) in fig.2 , those with @xmath45 ( hereafter @xmath46 ) in fig.3 , and those with single-@xmath3 through @xmath47 pair production ( hereafter @xmath48 ) in fig.4 .",
    "the total cross sections with a full set of diagrams at the cm energy points of 340 - 500 gev are summarized in table 3 and fig.5 a ) and b ) .",
    "both in a ) and b ) of fig.5 , solid lines show the numerical result of the total cross section with all the diagrams .",
    "the result with only the dominant @xmath8 diagrams are shown by dashed line in both a ) and b ) . besides results with all the diagrams and that with @xmath8 diagrams , we also showed those with @xmath8 and the major background diagrams .",
    "dotted lines in a ) and b ) show the result with @xmath49 and @xmath50 and that with @xmath8 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "dot - dashed lines in a ) and b ) show the result with @xmath8 , @xmath50 , and @xmath48 and that with @xmath8 , @xmath52 , and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "these results shown by dotted lines and dot - dashed lines include the interferences among selected diagrams .    as shown in fig.5 , cross sections with both @xmath8 and the major background diagrams show different behaviors from that with all the diagrams . the difference between them",
    "is about 3% at @xmath53 = 500 gev .",
    "this means that the effect from the interference between @xmath8 and the rest diagrams except @xmath44 , @xmath46 , and @xmath48 are also not negligible and important .",
    "the contribution from the background diagrams to the total cross section , @xmath54 , is less than 5% in total above the energy of twice of the top quark mass .      due to the large decay width of the top quark , at the @xmath8 threshold region",
    "it decays so immediately that the non perturbative qcd effect at the long distance does not take part .",
    "thus , the cross section of @xmath55 can be calculated by means of the perturbative qcd theory@xcite . by measuring the cross section of the @xmath8 production around the @xmath8 threshold region at the future linear colliders ,",
    "a clear test of the perturbative qcd theory is possible . to determine the qcd parameters like @xmath56 , it is essential to measure of the cross section accurately . in our calculation , the effects from initial state radiation , beamstrahlung , and beam energy spread were neglected .",
    "these effects to the shape of @xmath2 cross section has been well investigated by fujii _ el al._@xcite . besides these effects",
    ", it is important to take the effect such as the interferences between @xmath8 diagrams and the other background diagrams into account .",
    "it is found that there are destructive interferences between diagrams with @xmath27 production and those with single-@xmath3 through ww pair production around the @xmath8 threshold region . in order to see the behavior of these destructive interferences the values of @xmath57",
    "are plotted at several energy points in fig.6 .",
    "the magnitude of the destructive interference is as large as 10 % at @xmath58 = 340 gev .",
    "then it drops rapidly as cm energy goes up . in the energy region above twice of the top quark mass , this destructive interference becomes less than 2 % and above @xmath1 = 360 gev it becomes negligible small .    when we generate monte carlo events with the luminosity 1 @xmath59 in each energy points , the destructive interference of 10 % is not negligible compared to the statistical errors at the @xmath2 threshold region .",
    "for example , at @xmath1 = 350 gev the total cross section of @xmath60 is @xmath61 pb and the statistical error is estimated to be a few % .      above the @xmath8 threshold energy region , there open the opportunities of measuring the top production and decay couplings .",
    "for this analysis , the process of semi - leptonic 4-jets plus 1 charged lepton is useful to distinguish @xmath3 from @xmath4 by the electric charge of the lepton .",
    "generally , in order to select the semi - leptonic @xmath2 production events , firstly an isolated charged lepton and 4 jets are required in the event .",
    "then two jets out of the four are to be identified as @xmath62 jets in the vertex detector . from the electric charge of lepton",
    ", we can determine the hemisphere where 3 jets from the top quark appear .",
    "if the invariant mass of 2 jets in this hemisphere and one of @xmath62 jets becomes nearly equal to the mass of the top quark , we accept it as the @xmath2 production event .    the invariant mass distribution of @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and that of @xmath62 and @xmath65 at @xmath66 gev are shown in fig.7 a ) and b ) , respectively . in fig.7",
    ", histograms show the invariant mass distributions for the diagrams of @xmath8 production and crosses show those for all the diagrams .",
    "as shown in fig.7 a ) , if we take only those events around the top quark mass on the @xmath28 distribution , the contribution from the background diagrams becomes negligibly small .",
    "at the energy of @xmath1 = 500gev , when the top quark mass cut , _",
    "e.g. _ 148 gev @xmath67 204 gev is applied , the contribution from the background diagrams is reduced from about 5% to less than 3% . in fig.7 b ) , crosses shows that the contribution from @xmath44 diagrams can be seen at the low - end and the contribution from @xmath46 diagrams can be seen at the mass of z boson .    for the analysis of the top couplings , it should be noticed that the top quark decays immediately before it hadronizes and its spin information is transferred to the final state particles@xcite .",
    "the angles of the final state particles are important parameters in order to reconstruct the production angle of the top quark . here",
    ", we show the angular distributions of final @xmath68 in fig.8 .",
    "the backgrounds in the forward angle region , from all the diagrams are significant in the distribution of the @xmath69 angular distribution , at @xmath66 gev .",
    "for example , when the top quark mass cut such as 148 gev @xmath67 204 gev is applied , the effects from the background in the angular distribution of @xmath69 can be reduced to less than 2% but still exists as shown in fig.8 b ) .",
    "the total cross section of @xmath9 process at the energy range of @xmath1 = 340 - 500 gev was calculated with a complete set of tree diagrams by using grace . among all diagrams ,",
    "the main contribution to the total cross section comes from the @xmath2 production diagrams .",
    "the background to the @xmath70 production from all the diagrams is below 5% above the @xmath70 threshold .",
    "the contributions from the major background diagrams such as @xmath44 , @xmath46 , and single-@xmath3 through @xmath71 pair production are also calculated .",
    "compared these results to those with all diagrams , it is found that the interference between @xmath8 and the rest diagrams except the major backgrounds is not negligible .",
    "it is also found that the diagrams of @xmath27 production and those with single-@xmath3 through ww pair production make a strong destructive interference ( as large as 10% ) around the @xmath27 threshold region .",
    "this destructive interference has a deep effect on the shape of the @xmath27 cross section at the @xmath2 threshold region .",
    "we calculated the distributions of the invariant masses and the angular distribution of the final state particles at @xmath72 gev .",
    "angular distributions of @xmath68 shows a large effect of backgrounds at the forward angle .",
    "even when we apply the cut in the invariant mass distribution of @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 to enhance the top quark signal , the background from the diagrams with @xmath44 , @xmath46 and single-@xmath3 through ww pair did not disappear in the angular distribution of @xmath69    as a conclusion , for the analysis of the top quark physics around the @xmath8 threshold region and above , the accurate calculation including full set of 232 feynman diagrams is essential .",
