    "it is widely believed that the sunspot activity is governed by a hydromagnetic turbulent dynamo operating deep in the solar convection zone .",
    "the meridional circulation , which is observed on the surface as a steady flow from the equator to the poles with a speed of 10 - 20 m / s , is often considered as an important ingredient of the solar dynamo @xcite .",
    "it is suggested that the equator - ward meridional flow in the deep convection zone can promote the drift of sunspot activity from mid latitudes to the equator in the course of the 11-year solar cycle ( so - called `` butterfly diagram '' ) , and that the near - surface pole - ward flows can be responsible for the meridional drift of the poloidal magnetic field from mid - latitudes to the poles .",
    "this idea is extensively used in the babcock - leighton type solar dynamo models .",
    "despite the fact that , the mean - field dynamo models can reproduce the main properties of the solar cycles without meridional circulation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the circulation affects details of the model . in particular ,",
    "if the dynamo effect is distributed in the bulk of the convection zone , the circulation properties may affect the magnetic field distribution with depth .",
    "for example , the meridional circulation pattern , which is derived from a mean field model of the solar differential rotation has the latitudinal flow concentrated to the boundaries of the convection zone @xcite .",
    "such circulation swaps the toroidal magnetic fields to the bottom of the convection zone , and the poloidal magnetic fields get concentrated to the poles @xcite .",
    "the helioseismology inversions suggest that the global circulation may consist of two cells in the radial direction ( see , @xcite ) . in the northern hemisphere ,",
    "the flow direction is from the equator to the poles at the top of the convection zone , and the flow direction is reversed in the bottom cell .",
    "such double - cell circulation is also found in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the influence of multi - cell circulation on the flux - transport dynamo models was previously studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they found that in the case of double - cell circulation pattern , the evolution of the large - scale toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields in such models can be qualitatively different from the solar observations .    in this article",
    "we examine effects of the double - cell meridional circulation pattern ( see , fig[fig : profiles]d ) in a mean - field dynamo model , in which the magnetic field generation is distributed in the bulk of the convection zone , and the migration of the magnetic field on the surface is controlled by the subsurface rotational shear layer action .",
    "this type of the subsurface - shear shaped dynamo was originally suggested by @xcite and was extensively studied in our recent papers ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular , it was found that such dynamo model can reproduce the known statistical relation of the solar cycles @xcite . here",
    ", we investigate effects of the double - cell meridional circulation pattern in this model , and show that the resulted evolution of the large - scale magnetic field is in good qualitative agreement with observations .",
    "we consider a large - scale axisymmetric magnetic field , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the azimuthal component , @xmath2 is proportional to the azimuthal component of the vector potential , @xmath3 is the radial coordinate , and @xmath4 is the polar angle .",
    "the mean flow is given by velocity vector @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the angular velocity of the solar differential rotation , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are velocity components of meridional circulation .",
    "the mean magnetic field is governed by the induction equation : @xmath9 where the mean electromotive force , @xmath10 , is given by @xcite(hereafter p08 ) .",
    "the model formulation is essentially the same as in our previous papers @xcite .",
    "the only difference is that we add the effect of the double - cell meridional circulation in the dynamo equation .",
    "the mean electromotive force , which describes effects of turbulent flows and turbulent magnetic fields on the large - scale magnetic field evolution , is rather complicated .",
    "the results of global dynamo simulations suggest that we have to take into account the full information about @xmath10 to match the mean - field dynamo model to the results of the direct numerical simulations .",

    "one of the principal features of the model is that it takes into account the subsurface shear layer .",

    "the growth of the magnetic dipole corresponds to the enhanced poloidal magnetic field generation in this interval of the circulation speed , which can be due to a resonance between the meridional circulation and the dynamo wave propagation in the middle of the convection zone .",

    "digrams the maxima of the polar magnetic field and the axial dipole correspond to the minima of the sunspot number .",
    "the reversals of the polar magnetic field correspond to the sunspot maxima . for the axial dipole this phase relation fluctuates and observations show a delay of about two years in the last solar cycle , which is not explained in our models .    in the case of ideal synchronization",
    "the two subsequent cycles would produce the parabolic curve in the phase diagrams .",
    "this is also found for the sunspot cycles 21 and 22 which were not very different in amplitude .",

    "while our model qualitatively reproduces the phase relation , it does not explain observed a sudden decrease of the sunspot activity in cycle 23 .    in these calculations",
    ", we assumed that the sunspot activity originates from the toroidal magnetic field at @xmath81 ( just below the subsurface shear layer ) because this depth provided the best agreement with observations for the model without circulation flow .",
    "it is interesting that for the models with the meridional flow the acceptable range of the depths is significantly broader .",
    "we investigated the stability of the obtained solutions with respect to changes of the circulation pattern and the other parameters of the model .",
    "the results similar shown in figures 2 and 3 , are obtained for the case of pure a @xmath91 dynamo ( without the @xmath12 effect ) .",
    "however , in this case , the cycle overlap in the time - latitude diagrams is much stronger than in figures 3(b , c ) .",
    "the similar time - latitude butterfly diagrams are obtained also for the case when the meridional circulation forms only one cell per hemisphere with the stagnation point radius larger than @xmath92 .",
    "this is because of the subsurface rotational shear layer , which plays the primary role in the model . for the deeper stagnation point the dynamo wave",

    "also , we checked the effect of the meridional circulation in the simplified model which was presented by @xcite . in that model",
    "the @xmath11-effect was confined in the low - latitude @xmath93 zone .",
    "the results are generally similar to what is shown in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "the main findings can be summarized as follows .",
    "the mean - field dynamo model that includes the subsurface rotational shear layer and the double - cell ( in radius ) meridional circulation , indicated by the recent helioseismology results , can reproduce the solar magnetic cycles in the form of the time - latitude `` butterfly '' diagrams .",
    "the double - cell circulation affects the distribution of the magnetic field with radius in the convection zone , increasing the field concentration to the convection zone boundaries , and n the middle of the convection zone where the two cells converge .",
    "the latter effect can lead to a non - monotonic profile of the amplitude of the large - scale poloidal magnetic field in response to an increase of the circulation speed .",
    "the models qualitatively explains the observed synchronization between the polar magnetic field strength and the sunspot number .",
    "however , it does not explain the sudden drop of the sun s magnetic activity in cycle 23 .",
    "this question has to be examined further in order to clarify the detail of this synchronization . by comparing the toroidal field migration speed at the different depths with the observed characteristics speed of the sunspot formation zone we found that the range of the depth of the active region emerging flux can be between 0.82 - 0.92@xmath62 .",
