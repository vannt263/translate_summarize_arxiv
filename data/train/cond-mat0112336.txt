    "one of the basic principles over which the thermodynamics is built , derives from the simple observation that when two systems a and b are brought together so that they can exchange energy ( or in thermal contact ) , after some time they reach a mutual macroscopic equilibrium state in the absence of energy sources , i.e. their temperatures become equal .",
    "a second observation is that the thermal equilibrium between a third system c and a implies the thermal equilibrium between b and c. these two facts , which represent the content of the zeroth law of thermodynamics , give sense to the concept of temperature and allow us to build thermometers @xcite .",
    "the simplest state of aggregation of matter , namely the gaseous state , offers a neat example of the validity of such a principle .",
    "when in equilibrium the state of a mixture of different gases is characterized by a single temperature , i.e. every species has the same average kinetic energy per particle regardless its molecular nature .    an interesting question related to the zeroth law",
    "arises quite naturally when we consider the behavior of granular gases , as assemblies of moving grains at low density are usually called .",
    "more in general , granular matter represents a relatively new and unexplored area of research which has attracted the attention of physicists . as ordinary matter granular matter may appear under different guises : solid - like or dense aggregates of particles where the motion of its constituents is negligible , liquid - like when a dense aggregate flows , and as a gas when the mutual distances between grains are larger that their typical linear size .",
    "of course , such a classification is empirical but quite loose , since we are not allowed to employ concepts such as thermodynamic phases , in fact granular matter does not fall into the realm of thermodynamics .",
    "in other words , only if we are able to show that the basic laws of thermodynamics work in the case of granular materials we can employ its results .",
    "there is an emerging consensus that granular materials do not achieve a proper thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "hence , even if the temperature of a granular assembly can be suitably defined , it does not have the properties required by standard thermodynamics , as we shall discuss below .",
    "we shall not digress on some interesting recent proposals aimed to define the temperature of granular packings @xcite , which is a measure of the potential energy landscape , but we shall confine our attention to dilute systems of granular particles , where the term granular temperature , defined exactly in the same way as in ordinary gases , i.e. as the average of the kinetic energy per particle , has been coined  @xcite .",
    "how far pursue such an analogy ? .",
    "is the granular temperature a common feature of all granular gases in mutual equilibrium , i.e. the quantity which has the role of determining if two system are in equilibrium with respect to each other with respect to exchanges of energy ?",
    "if it is not so , the granular temperature has to be regarded just as an ensemble average of the kinetic energy of the grains , which may depend on the microscopic details and therefore is spoiled of one of its most useful characteristics .    in the present paper",
    "we shall deal with such an issue through a simple model of granular mixture . to be more specific",
    "we shall describe a granular mixture by means of a model of the maxwell type , i.e. a model characterized by a collision rate which is independent of the relative velocity of the colliding particles @xcite .",
    "such a class of models has its justification in the case of elastic maxwell molecules , i.e. particles interacting via a soft repulsive pair potential of the form @xmath2 . in the case of inelastic particles",
    "the constant collision rate is just a matter of mathematical convenience , since it does not correspond to any known microscopic interaction . in spite of that",
    ", it has been demonstrated by several authors @xcite,@xcite@xcite,@xcite @xcite , that the cost of sacrificing physical realism has been widely compensated by the amount of exact analytical results and simplification even in the numerical treatment of the collision process . on the other hand",
    "the real question is : what are the physical consequences of the constant collision rate on our predictions ?",
    "some of these are robust with respect to the choice of the model others will be peculiar , as we shall discuss below .",
    "an interesting observation is that the homogeneous cooling states of maxwell models and of more realistic models become quite similar if one measures the respective evolutions in terms of the number of collisions occurred up to a given instant , while they are very different in the presence of spatial inhomogeneities @xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . in the case of granular mixtures",
    "there is another aspect which is robust with respect to the choice of the model , namely the existence of a two temperature behavior .",
    "in fact , this has already been observed by dufty and garz @xcite in a study of the cooling of a mixture based on the enskog approximation and experimentally by feitosa and menon @xcite in a mixture subject to external driving .",
    "the maxwell model , we shall study , also shows such a behavior , but offers the advantage that , being considerably simpler than other approaches , provides a guidance to understand the global aspect of the problem .    summarizing , the choice of the model is deliberately minimalistic for the following three important reasons :    \\a ) the simplicity of the model allows us to avoid the usual problem of the closure of the correlation hierarchy in statistical physics and the need of introducing approximations .",
    "in fact , the boltzmann equation turns out to be exact for the model we study , so that none of the results we find can be ascribed to a breakdown under some peculiar conditions of some physically motivated approximation , such as the boltzmann molecular chaos hypothesis ;    \\b ) most of the work can be performed analytically and even the form of the asymptotic solutions of the boltzmann equation can be estimated in closed manner with a fairly good accuracy ;    \\c ) our solutions can be validated by simple simulations of the microscopic collision process .",
    "perhaps it is worth to mention that as an unexpected byproduct of our study we have found a rich variety of behaviors of the velocity distributions as a function of the microscopic control parameters .",
    "the common feature of all these distributions is the presence of inverse power law high velocity tails .",
    "these arise quite naturally from our microscopic dynamics and do not need any fine tuning of the parameters , a feature somehow similar to that which characterize the so called self organized criticality .    incidentally , the observed inverse - power laws for the distributions are identical to those predicted by the non extensive statistical mechanics ( nesm ) approach @xcite @xcite , which apart from some exceptions still lacks of dynamical foundations . an important point",
    "to stress is the fact that the observed behavior derives from the solution of the boltzmann transport equation for a system clearly inspired to the physics of granular materials and already employed in the past , and not the result of assumptions about the form of the generalized entropy , as we shall see below .",
    "the structure of the present paper is the following : in section ii we introduce the model , define the notation and write the boltzmann equation ; in section iii we set up the moment expansion and characterize by a granular temperature the macroscopic state of each component ; sections iv and v , in which we discuss how the scaling solutions for the boltzmann equation can be obtained , contain all technical details ; in section vi we comment the connections between our results and the the nesm approach ; in vii we present our conclusions .",
    "we shall consider an assembly of @xmath3 particles of species @xmath4 and @xmath5 particles of species @xmath6 endowed with scalar velocities @xmath7 , with @xmath8 .",
    "the two species may have different masses , @xmath9 and @xmath10 and/or different restitution coefficients @xmath11 .",
    "the main assumptions of the model are :    \\a ) the forces are pairwise and impulsive , so that their velocities change at each collision according to the following rule :    [ collision ] @xmath12\\frac{m_{\\beta}}{m_{\\alpha}+ m_{\\beta}}(v^{\\alpha}_i - v^{\\beta}_j ) \\\\",
    "v^{'\\beta}_j & =   v^{\\beta}_j+ [ 1+r_{\\alpha \\beta}]\\frac{m_{\\alpha}}{m_{\\alpha}+m_{\\beta}}(v^{\\alpha}_i - v^{\\beta}_j)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    \\b ) collisions involving simultaneously more than two particles are disregarded ;    \\c ) within the spirit of mean field models all pairs are allowed to exchange momentum regardless of their mutual positions .    in eqs .",
    "the primed quantities are the post - collisional velocities and are a linear combination of the velocities before the collisions .",
    "the process conserves the number of particles of each species and the total impulse @xmath13 .    to study the statistical behavior of the system we consider the coupled equations for the velocity probability distribution functions @xmath14 , which give the probability density of finding a particle of species @xmath15 with velocity @xmath16 at the instant @xmath17 .",
    "in the absence of driving forces we write the following two component boltzmann equation :    @xmath18 . \\label{boltzmann}\\ ] ]    the system of boltzmann equations describes the evolution of the p.d.f . of the velocities in the case of @xmath3 and @xmath5 going to infinity . from a rigorous point of view correlations",
    "can appear in a finite system even if such a mean field approach is employed , i.e. the molecular chaos assumption underlying the boltzmann equation is no more guaranteed to be true for finite @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "the typical mechanism of failure of the molecular chaos is the re - collision process : the collisional history of two colliding particles may overlap and therefore the two colliding particles are somehow correlated , e.g. the two particles may have collided together in the recent past or may have collided with different particles that have collided together at previous times ( ring collisions ) . in the simulations we have always used at least one million of particles : this is enough , we think , to expect a good comparison with analytical results .    eliminating the pre - collisional velocities",
    "@xmath19 in favor of the post - collisional velocities by means of eq .",
    "we obtain the non linear system :    [ prob ] @xmath20    the generalization to many components is straightforward .",
    "to proceed further , it is useful to employ the method of characteristic functions @xcite,@xcite , i.e. the fourier transforms of the probability densities defined as :    @xmath21    the integral equations in fourier space assume the more convenient form :    [ fou ] @xmath22    where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and    @xmath25 \\\\ \\tilde\\gamma_{21 } & = [ 1-\\frac{2}{1+\\zeta^{-1}}(1-\\gamma_{12 } ) ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    interestingly , a mixture of elastic particles of unequal masses does equilibrate under the evolution rule , unlike the case @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , the solutions of are gaussians @xmath27 , and in real space correspond to maxwellian velocity distributions .",
    "for finite inelasticity , let us tentatively assume @xmath28 to be analytic at the origin @xmath29 and perform a taylor expansion in powers of @xmath30 :    @xmath31    the coefficient @xmath32 of order @xmath33 of the expansion represents the n - th moment of the distribution @xmath14 according to the definition eq . .",
    "by substituting the taylor expansion and equating coefficients of powers of @xmath30 to zero one obtains a set of linear equations for the moments which can be systematically solved .",
    "the moments of order zero are @xmath34 , due to the normalization of @xmath14 , while those of first order are solutions of the coupled linear equations :    [ prim ] @xmath35 \\\\ \\partial_t \\mu^{2}_{1}(t)&= p(1-\\tilde\\gamma_{21 } ) [ \\mu^{(1)}_{1}-\\mu^{(2)}_{1}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the total impulse @xmath36 $ ] is a constant of motion and corresponds to the eigenvalue @xmath37 associated with the galilean invariance , of the linear system , whereas the negative eigenvalue @xmath38 $ ] , describes the exponential law @xmath39 by which two subsystems @xmath4 and @xmath6 in relative motion with respect to each other come to have the same average velocity .",
    "the second order cumulants represent the most important statistical indicator of the state of a granular gas and are usually taken as the definition of partial granular temperatures . in order to study their evolution one has to solve the following coupled linear equations for the second moments :    [ secon ] @xmath40    where the coefficients are given by :    @xmath41 + ( 1-p)[\\tilde\\gamma_{12}]^n \\\\ d^{(n)}_{12}&=(1-p)[(1-\\tilde\\gamma_{12})]^n \\\\ d^{(n)}_{22}&=-1+(1-p)[\\gamma_{22}^n+(1-\\gamma_{22})^n]+p[\\tilde\\gamma_{21}]^n \\\\ d^{(n)}_{21}&=p [ ( 1-\\tilde\\gamma_{21})]^n\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the solution of the system is a linear combination of real exponentials which can be expressed as :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are respectively the less negative and the more negative eigenvalue of the secular equation associated with the linear system .",
    "their computation is rather tedious and due to the presence of many control parameters not particularly illuminating , a part from simple limiting cases , for which one can extract useful information .",
    "for this reason in most cases we shall give their values by solving numerically the associated secular equation .",
    "an example of the dependence of the larger eigenvalue @xmath43 from the control parameters is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_autovalore ] .    for vanishing first moments the global granular temperature can be defined as :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 represents the partial granular temperature of species @xmath15 .",
    "notice that in the limit of an elastic system ( all @xmath47 but arbitrary @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) the eigenvalue @xmath50 reflects the energy conservation . on the other hand , for non vanishing inelasticity , i.e. values of @xmath51 ,",
    "the energy is dissipated at a finite rate .",
    "consider , for instance , an arbitrary composition @xmath49 , but @xmath52 and @xmath26 , a situation which describes the approach to the scaling regime of two subsystems @xmath4 and @xmath6 initially prepared at two different initial granular temperatures .",
    "one finds that the `` energy '' eigenvalue is @xmath53 while @xmath54 . to appreciate the role of @xmath44",
    "let us consider the ratio of the granular temperatures :    @xmath55    relation means that the resulting `` thermalization '' time , viz .",
    "the time spent to reach the homogeneous cooling regime is proportional to @xmath56 , i.e. is related to the difference between the two eigenvalues and attains its maximum for the largest inelasticity @xmath57 .",
    "the asymptotic value of the temperature ratio is given by :    @xmath58    it is clear from eq .",
    "that the two granular temperatures of the homogeneous cooling system are in general different ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_energy ] ) as already observed in a different model in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the case of an equimolar mixture ( @xmath59 ) with equal inelasticity parameters ( @xmath52 ) , but",
    "arbitrary mass ratio the temperature ratio is particularly simple :    @xmath60    notice that the second moment ratio @xmath61 approaches @xmath62 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 for @xmath65 . for small departures from the value @xmath26 a good approximation",
    "is :    @xmath66    i.e. the temperature ratio increases linearly as a function of @xmath48 and deviates from the equipartition value @xmath4 of an ideal gas mixture for non vanishing values of the inelasticity parameter @xmath67 . in figs .",
    "[ fig_rho ] and [ fig_t1t2 ] we display the moment ratio and the temperature ratio respectively for different values of the mass ratio and of composition .",
    "when one carries on the evaluation of higher order moments one discovers the following phenomenon , which is the symptom that the moment expansion is ill defined : the rescaled moments beyond that of order @xmath68 diverge , that is to say the decay of the @xmath68-th moment is slower than that of the @xmath69-th power of the second moment .",
    "ben - naim and krapivski @xcite found that in a pure system such a phenomenon occurs for all moments beyond the fourth .",
    "in other words the kurtosis of the velocity distribution diverges .",
    "this is the fingerprint of the presence of an inverse power - law tail in the velocity distribution function .",
    "the situation became clearer after the discovery of a scaling solution @xcite as we shall discuss below .",
    "a simple check shows that the state of affairs remains the same in the case of a multicomponent mixture . to show that , we write the evolution equations for the fourth moments :    [ qua ] @xmath70    where the coefficients @xmath71 are given by :    @xmath72 ^ 2 \\\\   a_{22}&=6 ( 1-p ) [ \\gamma_{22}(1-\\gamma_{22})]^2 \\\\ a_{12}&=6(1-p ) [ ( 1-\\tilde\\gamma_{12})]^2 [ \\tilde\\gamma_{12})]^2 \\\\ a_{21}&=6 p [ ( 1-\\tilde\\gamma_{21})]^2 [ \\tilde\\gamma_{21})]^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we have explored the hyper - surface @xmath26 of the five dimensional parameter space @xmath73 by randomly generating the values of the coupling constants @xmath74 and of the composition @xmath49 and computed the eigenvalues , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , with @xmath77 , of the secular equation for the fourth moments , observing that the less negative eigenvalue @xmath75 is larger than twice the eigenvalue @xmath43",
    "this is equivalent to say that after a transient the rescaled fourth moment will begin to diverge as in the one component case .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath78 we observed finite rescaled fourth moments .",
    "however , this fact does not imply that for such values of the parameters the moment expansion of the rescaled distribution holds to all orders .",
    "it only means that an analogous problem appears at an higher order of the moment expansion , say at the @xmath68-th moment .",
    "we shall elaborate on such an issue in section v.",
    "a clue to understand the divergence of the rescaled higher moments came recently from the analysis of the pure case .",
    "an exact asymptotic scaling solution of the master equation valid in the asymptotic regime has been found @xcite .",
    "the merit of such an explicit solution is to show that the characteristic function does not possess a moment expansion , because of the presence of a non analyticity at the origin , @xmath29 as shown by its representation :    @xmath79    where @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the square root of the second moment .    to appreciate such a result",
    "one can return to real velocity space where the distribution space is of the form :    @xmath82 ^ 2 } \\label{baldassariana}\\ ] ]    and that the moment beyond the third diverge due to the presence of the inverse - power @xmath83 tail .",
    "in fact , it is a general principle that when a singularity of the function in @xmath30-space approaches the real axis the behavior of the large @xmath16 components of its fourier transform turns from exponential to power law @xcite@xcite .",
    "an immediate check shows that in the two - component case the above formula fails to provide the correct solution of the master equation , with the exception of some special cases , which correspond to a ratio of the second moments equal to @xmath4 .",
    "let us stress the importance of scaling solutions in the cooling of an inelastic gas .",
    "their existence means that the distribution is fully characterized by its second moment and is self similar , i.e. asymptotically its shape does not change apart from a trivial rescaling .",
    "moreover , it demonstrates that in the cooling problem the distribution functions do not look at all like the distribution functions of an elastic system , which have an infinite number of non diverging moments .",
    "the change induced by the presence of inelasticity is a singular perturbation , viz .",
    "an abrupt qualitative modification of the statistical properties of the systems .",
    "do scaling solutions exist in the case of binary mixtures ?",
    "to answer such a question let us assume that for a constant cooling rate there exists a scaling solution of the form @xmath84 .",
    "this implies that the master equation for @xmath85 can be converted into a differential equation with respect to the independent variable @xmath30 with time independent coefficients . in the one component case it can be cast in the form :    @xmath86    with @xmath15 a constant .",
    "eq . displays the presence of a regular singular point at the origin , @xmath29 .",
    "therefore we look for a particular solution of the the form : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the so called indicial exponent and @xmath89 is a function which is analytic at @xmath29 , whose value can be determined by the frobenius method @xcite , which provides a systematic tool to compute the solution as a power series of @xmath30 with non integer exponents .",
    "if @xmath89 is analytic one can write : @xmath90    however , instead of employing the general method we found more convenient to extend to the two component case the abridged version employed by ernst and brito to ascertain the nature of the high - velocity tails of the distributions @xcite,@xcite .",
    "their technique consists in replacing the small-@xmath30 frobenius expansion with its first few terms which contain a contribution non analytic at the origin and determining self - consistently the indicial exponent .",
    "we assume that the leading singularities of the fourier transforms are of the form :    @xmath91    with exponent @xmath88 and amplitudes @xmath92 , @xmath93 to be determined by substituting the above approximation into the master equation .",
    "the reason for keeping the fourth term will become clear below .",
    "notice that the first two terms in eq .",
    "are fixed respectively by the normalization condition and by the variance of the distribution .",
    "in fact , up to the second order eq . is analytic and identical to the taylor expansion .    substituting eq .. ) into eqs . and",

    "the exponent @xmath88 the determinant of the coefficients is zero and there exist non vanishing solutions .",
    "in other words we are requiring a solvability condition .",

    "in fact , these two values correspond to the zeroth and second moment .",
    "the non trivial value @xmath99 represents the indicial exponent associated with the singularity .",
    "somehow surprisingly , we find that such a value of @xmath88 is distributed continuously in the interval @xmath100 as a function of the control parameters . in other words",
    "it means that the inverse - power law tails of the distribution are sensitive to the composition and to the nature of the interactions in the mixture .",
    "we have not found any simple dependence of the exponent @xmath88 , on the control parameters .",
    "nevertheless , for small asymmetry we observe that @xmath88 seems to deviate from the exponent @xmath101 of the pure system quadratically with the temperature ratio .",
    "knowing just the first three terms of the series , apart from the value of the constant @xmath102 which is still at our disposal , we make the hypothesis that they represent the truncation of the expansion of the following characteristic function :    @xmath103    where @xmath104 and @xmath105 is the modified bessel function of the second kind of order @xmath106 .",
    "to render the matter clearer we employ the the following frobenius series representation @xcite :    @xmath107    \\end{split}\\ ] ]    considering just the first few terms @xmath108    thus one can see that the first terms of the series and have the same exponents .",
    "therefore by suitably choosing the coefficients of we can obtain the bessel function .",

    "such an approximate form clearly displays the inverse power law tails with the characteristic exponent @xmath115 . for a pure system since @xmath116 it reduces to the known solution @xcite .",
    "numerically we found that such an approximation gives excellent results with an error which is compatible with the uncertainty of the numerical data as shown in fig.[fig_v_zeta1 ] .",
    "notice that the indicial equation does not give the value of @xmath93 , but this has been fixed by our ansatz .",
    "on the other hand we might ask how good is the ansatz . to clarify such an issue we substitute the expansion into the scaling form of the master equation and find two linear inhomogeneous algebraic equations for the two unknown @xmath117 and @xmath118 . without giving all the details we notice that these equations have certainly non zero solutions in virtue of the fact observed above , eqs . that the eigenvalues of the fourth moment is not twice the eigenvalues of the of the second moment .",
    "the numerical solution of the linear system gives two values of the @xmath119 s which in general are different ( @xmath120 ) for non special values of the parameters , hence the ansatz represents only an approximation .",
    "the consequences of this small discrepancy are probably of minor importance for the cases considered in the present section .",
    "the deviation of the true series from the series representation of the approximate solution , might manifest itself in a small asymmetry in the two rescaled distribution functions , and this might involve the region of small values of @xmath16 . in principle there",
    "exist the possibility of constructing a better solution via the frobenius method .",
    "however , we believe that one could hardly find a closed form of the distribution functions via an inverse fourier transform of simplicity comparable to that of eq . finally , let us remark that the fairly good agreement between our approximation and the numerically computed solution stems from the fact that the form we propose embodies not only the three following basic ingredients : i ) the normalization condition , ii ) the correct value of the variance and iii ) the appropriate tails of the distributions , but also some properties of the exact distribution which one can guess on the basis of pure physical reasoning .",
    "these properties are that @xmath121 is symmetric w.r.t .",
    "@xmath16 , is monotonically decreasing for @xmath122 , and is smooth .",
    "such assumptions hugely restrict the class of all possible candidate distributions compatible with the first few terms of the expansion . in practice",
    "we match the small-@xmath30 behavior with the small @xmath123 behavior , which is equivalent to the large @xmath30-behavior .",
    "so far we have employed the approximate expansion and found that on the hypersurface @xmath26 the indicial exponent @xmath88 lies in the continuous interval @xmath124 correspondingly the distributions possess finite second moments , but diverging fourth moments . on the other hand for @xmath78",
    "as anticipated in section iii it is possible to observe different kinds of behaviors .",
    "the feature which makes the difference is what might be called the `` isotopic effect '' , i.e. induced solely by the difference of masses in a binary mixture of particles , otherwise identical .",
    "one observes the following phenomenon : all rescaled moments @xmath125 up to the @xmath68-th order are asymptotically finite , but diverge beyond @xmath68 .",
    "this is indicative of solutions characterized by very large values of @xmath88 . in other words , the allowed interval of values of @xmath88",
    "is expanded .",
    "this physically means that the exponent @xmath88 evolves from a pronounced inverse power law to a gaussian - like behavior as @xmath48 deviates from unity .",
    "of course , the crossover from one regime to the other is determined by the inelasticity and by the mass ratio in the first place , but the value of the exponent does not depend on any simple way from the control parameters .",
    "numerically we have considered different coupling parameters and obtained the results shown in fig.[fig_sigma ] showing the trend that the exponent of the tails increases with decreasing inelasticity and with the difference @xmath126 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_v_zeta_vari ] we have plotted the distributions obtained with different values of @xmath48 , showing the change of the exponent of the tails with @xmath48 . we must stress the difficulty of obtaining clear numerical results for the exponents of the power law tails in the case of large values of the singularity @xmath88 ( or of the absolute value of the exponent itself , which is @xmath127 ) : in fact high inverse - power law tails need far larger statistics to be appreciated ; moreover , it appears ( numerically ) that for large ( negative ) values of the expected power , the tail appears later in the @xmath128 domain : this means that with a finite statistics one can measure powers smaller , in absolute value , than those expected from the analysis of indicial equations .",
    "this phenomena has been observed also in  @xcite .    to simplify the analysis ,",

    ". the decay rate of the energy is given by @xmath137 .",
    "what happens to the light component ? within this limit the evolution equation for @xmath138 looks very different from that of @xmath139 .",
    "in fact , the numerical solutions indicate the existence of tails with very large values of @xmath88 .",
    "how can we find this value of the exponent , knowing that the tails of the species @xmath4 diverge as @xmath83 ?",
    "the trick is to substitute in the expansion and neglect the contribution stemming from @xmath139 because it corresponds to another degree of singularity . at the end one obtains the new indicial equation :    @xmath140 + p |1 - 2 \\gamma|^{\\sigma_2}=0 \\label{sing2}\\ ] ]    which for small values of @xmath67 has a solution @xmath141 .",
    "that is to say for a quasi - elastic system the exponent of the singularity diverges and all moments exist . to understand such a result we can reconsider the rule and see that for @xmath63 the collisions between unlike particles do not change neither the energy nor the velocity of the heavy species , whereas it changes the velocity of particles @xmath6 in the following way :    @xmath142    i.e. the species @xmath4 acts on @xmath6 as a stochastic noise , since @xmath143 is randomly distributed according to @xmath144 .",
    "such a phenomenon is peculiar of the inelastic system under scrutiny and represents a sort of `` reversed brownian '' motion in which the heavy particles act as a heat bath for the light particles .    in the case of finite @xmath48",
    "we have solved the indicial equation and constructed the curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_sigma_diff ] . for small values of the inelasticity",
    "@xmath67 the surface raises steeply as @xmath48 departs from @xmath4 , attains a maximum and then decreases again reaching the asymptotic value @xmath101 for very large values of @xmath48 , as predicted by our asymptotic analysis ( see fig . [ fig_sigma ] ) . for larger values of the inelasticity such isotopic effect",
    "is less pronounced .",
    "this reentrant behavior of @xmath88 with @xmath48 is mirrored by an analogous behavior of the rescaled moments .",
    "to conclude , we remark that for large values of @xmath106 the coefficients of the series expansion in powers of @xmath16 of order @xmath145 are very close to the corresponding coefficients of the series expansion of the gaussian , and only for @xmath146 the power law behavior of the tails becomes manifest .",
    "this means that numerically it might be very difficult to detect such a region .",
    "finally for large @xmath106 , which correspond to elastic systems , one recovers the gaussian distribution :    @xmath147^{\\nu+\\frac{1}{2 } } } = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}}\\frac{1}{v_0 } e^{-\\frac{v^2}{2 v_0 ^ 2 } } \\label{scali3}\\ ] ]    the re - entrance phenomenon of the exponent @xmath88 deserves a comment .",
    "in fact we have seen that @xmath88 controls the tails of the distribution of the heavy component only .",
    "in fact , even for @xmath48 finite , but larger than some value @xmath148 one observes a bifurcation of the exponents . for @xmath149 the exponent of the heavy component begin to be different from the exponent of the light component .",
    "therefore , our approximation consisting in assuming the same indicial value for both subsystems becomes untenable .",
    "nevertheless , we can find the correct values of the exponents @xmath150 and @xmath151 , by considering that there is no interference between the two singularities associated with @xmath152 and @xmath153 and therefore we get two decoupled indicial equations .",
    "the resulting scenario is quite intriguing . after the bifurcation we have two separate trajectories obtained by drawing the values of @xmath150 and @xmath151 against @xmath48 .",
    "correspondingly the probability distribution functions of the two subsystems belong to two different critical hyper - surfaces . in the limit of @xmath154 one subsystem flows to the gaussian elastic fixed point ,",
    "the other flows to the inelastic fixed point .",
    "we have discussed the cooling behavior of a simple model of granular material and found that the process gives rise to scaling forms of the probability distribution function .",
    "somehow surprisingly , the distribution function has an inverse power law decay for large velocities of the form @xmath155 with an exponent @xmath88 which depends in a non trivial fashion on the various control parameters and can vary in the interval @xmath156 in a continuous way .",
    "it is an intriguing fact that such inverse - power law like behavior looks undeniably similar to that emerging in the context of the so called nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , no other model of comparable simplicity to the present yields similar laws @xcite as a result of a dynamical process .",
    "we stress again that none of our results has been derived from assumptions about the functional form of a generalized entropy and an associated maximum entropy principle .",
    "our results follow from a completely independent approach , namely the exact treatment of inelastic collisions based on the master equation .",
    "a possible explanation of why the nonextensive statistical mechanics and our formulas are so similar can be found in the non extensive properties of the energy which is a key assumption of nesm and a characteristic of our granular model .",
    "in addition , the mean field type of couplings of the present model might be a crucial ingredient to determine the observed inverse power law tails .",
    "to make an example let us take two different systems at the same temperatures and observe that they do not equilibrate at a temperature ratio equal to one . repeating the experiment with a third system we would find a different temperature ratio for each new pair we can form",
    "this reflects the non conservation of the kinetic energy ; moreover the amount by which it is non conserved depends on the microscopic details of the two systems we bring together .",
    "classically the temperature , besides being the average of the kinetic energy , is also the intensive thermodynamic field conjugated to the entropy and the latter in turn is related to the distribution function .",
    "this is not the case of the granular temperature , which does not possess a definition via the entropic route , but only via the kinetic route . in nesm , instead , one defines a generalized entropy ,    @xmath157    where the @xmath158 are the probabilities associated with the microstates @xmath159 of the system .",
    "therefore @xmath160 does not have a unique expression as in classical physics , but varies with the exponent @xmath161 , connected to @xmath88 by the relation :    @xmath162    thus @xmath160 would be a function of the various couplings of the particular system under scrutiny .    summarizing , although the nesm is capable to yield our results , it does not provide the value of the exponent @xmath161 so that one needs an independent procedure to obtain it and compute the appropriate q - entropy .",
    "this non universality of the @xmath161 exponent means that one would need a q - entropy for each particular mixture .",
    "finally , a challenging situation for which we do not know the answer within the nesm , is the one inspired by the results of section v , where the two - components of the mixture are characterized by different power law tails ; even within the same `` experiment '' one has to resort to two different q - entropies .",
    "this state of affairs is just the result of the absence of the zeroth law of thermodynamics for granular systems , i.e. the fact that one needs a different thermometer for each particular granular mixture .",
    "let us anticipate that in the case of a homogeneously heated granular system our model still predicts a two temperature behavior under rather general conditions , but with the partial temperatures not varying in time @xcite . on the other hand , the velocity distribution function will not show any power - law tails , but will be very similar to gaussians and possess all finite moments .",
    "thus , the power - law behavior is a peculiarity of the cooling process and not a necessity of non extensivity , at least as far as our model is concerned .",
    "we have seen that the maxwell inelastic mixture displays a continuous spectrum of exponents characterizing the inverse power - law tails of the velocity distribution functions .",
    "the previously found solution of the pure system @xmath163 with tail exponent @xmath164 can now be regarded as special case .",
    "in fact , a whole spectrum of exponents extending from @xmath165 to @xmath166 exists . a natural question to ask",
    "is why the observed exponent @xmath88 deviates from the value of the pure system .",
    "the naive guess is that , since in the pure case the the solution shows the remarkable feature that its functional form is independent of the cooling rate , i.e. of the microscopic inelasticity parameter @xmath67 and that the tails decay invariably as @xmath83 , the same should be true in the case of a mixture of particles characterized by different restitution coefficients . on the contrary ,",
    "in the mixture case the @xmath88 exponent varies with the microscopic parameters .",
    "both these contrasting aspects , namely a single value of the exponent for the pure model and a continuous spectrum of values for the mixture recall the renormalization group theory of critical phenomena , where critical systems having different hamiltonians ( viz .",
    "different @xmath67 s in our pure case ) in the neighborhood of a fixed point share the same exponents . that is to say that the evolution drives all systems belonging to the same critical ( hyper)surface towards a common fixed point .",
    "this is why all pure systems exhibit identical asymptotic behaviors in spite of having different inelasticity parameter @xmath67 @xcite . on the other hand , mixtures correspond to systems whose trajectory lies on a hyper - surface whose points are attracted towards a fixed point characterized by @xmath167 , because of the presence of other scaling fields .",
    "the model can also be viewed as a quench realized rendering suddenly inelastic an initially elastic system .",
    "the subsequent cooling process takes the distribution from its elastic gaussian fixed point to to the zero temperature fixed point .",
    "the trajectory along which this process occurs is characterized by peculiar values of the distributions .",
    "the scaling behavior is associated with the dynamics of the approach to the fixed point .    why the scaling solution is selected ?",
    "let us make the following observation : if we consider a mixture with a large number of identical components , the mixture formalism allows us to describe independently the evolution of different subsystems .",
    "the associated secular equation for @xmath168 components will have @xmath168 eigenvalues , @xmath169 of them corresponding to the faster modes .",
    "the scaling solution corresponds to the slowest mode and is therefore stable , with respect to fluctuations .    to conclude ,",
    "the model we have investigated can be regarded as a kind of self - organized critical system . due to the mean field nature of the model the fluctuations of a given portion of the system",
    "can influence all other elements , i.e are very long ranged . in a more realistic description of the inelastic interaction the scenario illustrated above will not survive asymptotically , because of the onset of spatial fluctuations , i.e. of correlations which tend to erode the high velocity tails . these tails , on the other hand , might remain observable during the homogeneous cooling regime but will cease after the formation of spatial gradients in the system @xcite .    finally , we argue that the two temperature behavior and the existence of a common cooling rate for the two species and of scaling solutions is a robust feature even when a more realistic treatment of the collision term is performed @xcite .",
    "we wish to thank a. baldassarri , m.cencini and a.vulpiani for stimulating discussions .                                                           of the coefficient matrix of equation for the evolution of the second moment , as a function of the mass ratio @xmath48 .",
