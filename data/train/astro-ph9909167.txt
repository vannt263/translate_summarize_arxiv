    "photometric redshifts for of order @xmath1 galaxies in the cfdf will provide the means to address key issues in galaxy formation and evolution . the large areal coverage and simultaneous depth of the cfdf will enable a measurement of the bright end of the luminosity function ( lf ) ( describing rare , extremely luminous objects ) to @xmath2 , as well as an extension of the faint end of the lf ( ubiquitous faint objects ) a factor of 10 deeper than previous work ( lilly et al  1995b ) for @xmath3 .",
    "the galaxy  galaxy correlation function will be measured in the cfdf to @xmath4 on scales of order @xmath5 mpc , extending into the quasi - linear regime .",
    "the cfdf , undertaken on cfht and noao facilities , is a deep , multi",
    " colour imaging survey that covers over 1 deg@xmath0 .",
    "four @xmath6 fields were imaged in to nominal @xmath7 sensitivities of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "the image quality is excellent , ranging from about 0.6  in @xmath12 to about 1.0  in @xmath13 .",
    "several problems unique to cfht s uh8k camera ( metzger et al 1995 ) slowed the data reduction , however the pipeline is now in place .",
    "the reduction is about 50% complete and should be finished in a few months .    in order to obtain contiguous optical wavelength coverage ( out to 1 micron ) , the original  survey is currently being supplemented with @xmath14 and @xmath15 band data taken with the new cfh 12k ccd mosaic camera at cfht . some of this data is already in hand .",
    "it has been noted by several authors ( e.g. connolly et al 1997 , fernandez - soto et al 1999 ; see yee 1998 for a review ) that additional nir imaging is required to remove intrinsic degeneracies that exist between distinct galaxy types at different redshifts .",
    "kpno time has been allocated for infrared ( @xmath16 ) imaging of part of the cfdf fields with irim .",
    "the necessity of obtaining data at wavelengths longer than the @xmath12band was explicitly demonstrated in the detailed monte carlo simulations that are described in the next section .",
    "the inclusion of one ir band renders photometric redshifts immune to catastrophic errors and reduces the dispersion at all redshifts .",
    "extensive monte carlo simulations were performed in order to test the feasibility of photometric redshift estimation in the cfdf . repeated interpolation between the coleman , wu , and weedman ( 1980 , hereafter cww ) spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for e , sbc , scd , and irr",
    "galaxies resulted in 13 distinct template seds .",
    "the cww seds do not extend blueward of 1400  . while strong l@xmath17 emission aids both in the detection of faint galaxies and in estimation of their redshifts , it is often weak or absent due to severe dust obscuration . in an effort to remain as conservative as possible ,",
    "the cww seds were extrapolated to 1216   and were set to zero blueward .",
    "no modelling of the line was attempted , and little would be gained by extrapolating the seds right to 912  .",
    "the seds were convolved with generic @xmath18 filter response curves . to create the target galaxies , these seds",
    "were then redshifted into the range @xmath19 at @xmath20 intervals and random photometric errors consistent with those present in the cfdf were added .",
    "a @xmath21 fitting algorithm was used to compare the redshifted templates with the target galaxies , with the minimum value of @xmath21 corresponding to the best fitting redshift and template .",
    "the simulation was run 100 times for each target galaxy ( with different random photometric error each time ) , enabling an estimation of the typical dispersion in the best ",
    "fit redshift .",
    "several speakers at this meeting have pointed out that the use of spectroscopic training sets result in better redshift estimates than the use of templates derived from population synthesis models or measurements of local seds ( as in these simulations ) .",
    "this is due in part to the difficulty in accounting for galactic evolution , which is naturally present in a spectroscopic catalogue .",
    "however , in these simulations no evolutionary _ difference _ between target and template galaxies was present , therefore the accuracy should be similar to what would be obtained on real galaxies using an empirical training set . in the final analysis the @xmath22 cfrs galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts to @xmath23 will be used to train the redshift  finding algorithm .",

    "the top panels of figure [ z ] illustrate the results for @xmath24 early and late  type galaxies with the existing / scheduled  data .",
    "aliasing between ( @xmath25 ) ellipticals and ( @xmath26 ) spirals is apparent .",
    "this is likely due to the confusion of the balmer break and the redshifted uv cutoff .",
    "note that between @xmath27 the results are unaffected by this degeneracy and the photometric redshifts for these faint @xmath24 galaxies have mean dispersions of about @xmath28 ( see table [ table ] ) .",
    "the insets show the photometric redshift distribution obtained in the 100 trials at @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath29 redshift distribution is basically free of catastrophic errors in the redshift estimate , whereas the above  mentioned aliasing produces a strongly non  gaussian redshift distribution for late  type galaxies at @xmath31 . a similar distribution exists for @xmath32 ellipticals .",
    "catastrophic errors would clearly make an analysis impossible at these redshifts .",
    "the addition of @xmath16data ( bottom panels ) removes all degeneracies and allows more accurate photometric redshifts to be estimated at @xmath33 and probably to higher redshifts due to the presence of the lyman break .",
    "there are no catastrophic errors at @xmath29 or @xmath30 ; the redshift distributions are almost delta functions centered on the correct redshift .",
    "figure [ sigma ] shows the redshift dispersion as a function of redshift for each of the original cww galaxy types for the optical and optical+nir filter sets .",
    "the degeneracy between @xmath25 ellipticals and @xmath26 spirals is clearly seen for the @xmath34 estimates , but disappears when @xmath16 is added .",
    "( the error spike in @xmath35 late  type galaxies is an artifact caused by the inclusion of negative redshift template ellipticals used to obtain gaussian errors at @xmath36 . ) at @xmath37 , the mean redshift dispersion for all types of @xmath24 galaxies is @xmath38 , with _ no contamination from higher or lower redshift objects_. thus analyses performed at @xmath39 should be immune to catastrophic redshift errors .",
    "note that with the addition of @xmath16 data , the mean dispersion drops to @xmath40 for all galaxies to at least @xmath41 , with _ no catastrophic errors at any redshifts_. the salient features of this figure are summarized in table [ table ] .",
    "the cfdf is a large , deep , @xmath42 imaging survey covering over 1 deg@xmath0 and containing @xmath43 galaxies to @xmath44 .",
    "the science goals of the cfdf include measurements of the luminosity and correlation functions of galaxies to @xmath39 .",
    "as accurate photometric redshifts are required for these analyses , detailed monte carlo simulations were conducted to characterize the expected redshift errors .",
    "these simulations indicate that for faint @xmath24 galaxies , redshift dispersions of @xmath45 can be expected in the range @xmath37 for all galaxies imaged in @xmath34 , with no significant occurrence of catastrophic errors in redshift estimation . for the data additionally imaged in the near infrared ( @xmath16 )",
    ", the dispersion drops to @xmath40 over the range @xmath46 ( @xmath47 at @xmath48 ) with no catastrophic errors at these or higher redshifts .",
    "it is therefore expected that the redshift accuracy in the cfdf is sufficient to allow its science goals to be achieved .",
