    "in the process of forming , massive ( @xmath0 10 m@xmath1 ) stars produce massive bipolar outflows .",
    "in contrast to outflows from low - mass proto - stars , outflows from massive stars frequently have more mass than their presumed driving proto - star ( churchwell 1997 ) .",
    "the canonical explanation for the origin of the mass is that a less massive jet originating from either the accretion disk or protostar sweeps up and entrains ambient interstellar material .",
    "this model can potentially explain both the large masses and poor collimation of massive outflows .",
    "it may also explain how low - mass outflows become less collimated as they age ( bachiller and tafalla , 1998 ) .",
    "churchwell  ( 1997 ) argued that mechanical entrainment , through e.g. bow - shocks , could not simultaneously explain both the large mass and young age of massive outflows .",
    "shear flow , or kelvin - helmholtz , instabilities at the interface between the jet and the ambient material are an alternative possible mechanism for entrainment",
    ". the instability amplifies ripples at the interface , culminating in the development of a turbulent boundary layer which can transfer momentum from the jet to the ambient medium .",
    "a magnetic field parallel to the flow tends to suppress the instability because magnetic tension opposes rippling .",
    "the result is that instability is only present if the velocity shear is greater than the alfvn velocity ( chandrasekhar , 1961 ) .    the nonlinear development of the kelvin - helmholtz instability is strongly influenced by the magnetic field ( malagoli et al . ,",
    "1996 & jones et al . ,",
    "the numerical simulations performed by these authors show that the vortices created by the instability wind up the field until it reaches the ohmic scale .",
    "windup transfers energy to small scales , while ohmic dissipation heats the layer .",
    "these effects are absent in the field - free case .    in the following study",
    ", we investigate the kelvin - helmholtz instability in the linear , partially ionized regime to determine its possible contribution to entrainment in massive bipolar outflows .",
    "this problem can not be analyzed in the hydrodynamic regime because the neutral alfvn velocity ( v@xmath2 ) is sometimes larger than the flow speed , indicating that the magnetic field can be strong enough to affect the dynamics .",
    "on the other hand , the pure magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) regime is inappropriate because at sufficiently short wavelengths , alfvn waves propagate nearly independently of the neutrals .    in  2",
    "we describe a model that we believe is appropriate for massive outflows driven by massive protostars . in ",
    "3 we discuss the numerically - derived solutions to the dimensionless dispersion equation and equivalent analytical solutions to simplified versions of the dispersion equation .",
    "we demonstrate that there is a new instability , unique to the partially ionized regime , which results from ion - neutral slip . in  4 , we discuss the observational implications of our results , concentrating on the physical environment of the interaction zone between a bipolar outflow and the ambient interstellar material ( ism ) .",
    " 5 is a critical summary of the paper .",
    "we model the interaction zone between a high speed jet and the ambient ism by a slab geometry with a flow along the @xmath3-axis .",
    "the interface between the two fluids is the @xmath4 plane .",
    "the density is everywhere uniform , and the velocity is uniform except at @xmath5 , where it has a step .",
    "we assume the flow velocity @xmath6 decreases with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "the magnetic field is uniform and aligned with the flow , which maximizes its stabilizing effect in the @xmath8-direction .    in this model ,",
    "the equilibrium flow has zero vorticity except on the plane @xmath5 , where the vorticity is infinite . for our choice of coordinates and velocity profile ,",
    "the total vorticity integrated across the sheet is @xmath9 .",
    "the mechanism of the kelvin - helmholtz instability is explained in batchelor ( 1967 ) .",
    "suppose the interface is perturbed by a small amplitude ripple , as shown , in the center of mass frame , in figure  [ khdiagram ] .",
    "denote the vertical displacement of the vortex sheet by @xmath10 .",
    "in general , the vorticity perturbation is out of phase with @xmath10 . if it can be arranged that the vorticity has the distribution shown by the dashed line , then the equilibrium flow sweeps negative vorticity toward point @xmath11 on both sides of the interface .",
    "the effect is as if an extra eddy , rotating counterclockwise as sketched in the figure , were added to the flow .",
    "the centrifugal force associated with the eddy pushes the interface between @xmath11 and @xmath12 outward , resulting in the growth of @xmath10 with time .",
    "if the vorticity perturbation were shifted in phase by @xmath13 with respect to the dashed line , @xmath10 would shrink . as explained here",
    ", the instability mechanism requires advection of vorticity by the bulk flow in opposite directions above and below the interface .",
    "it is always possible to choose a reference frame in which this is the case , provided that the velocity profile has a jump .",
    "a magnetic field parallel to the flow exerts a tension force when bent .",
    "the tension force is stabilizing , and the criterion that it dominates hydrodynamic forces is roughly that the magnetic energy exceeds the kinetic energy of relative motion , or , equivalently , that the alfvn speed for the bulk medium exceed the flow speed .",
    "the basic mechanism of instability is unaffected by partial ionization . in the weakly ionized medium of interest here",
    ", the plasma component tends to be stable , because its low density implies low kinetic energy .",
    "the neutral component , on the other hand , is intrinsically unstable because it is not directly acted upon by magnetic forces .",
    "friction between the ions and neutrals allows magnetic forces to act on the neutrals .",
    "as we will see , however , no matter how large the magnetic field is , it can not stabilize the neutrals completely .    in the present discussion ,",
    "we follow the analysis of chandrasekhar ( 1961 ) but consider two fluids , charged and neutral , coupled by elastic collisions .",
    "we assume the medium is incompressible ( @xmath14 = 0 ) .",
    "our problem is described by the neutral and ion momentum equations and the magnetic induction equation :    @xmath15    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the neutral - ion collision frequency , and @xmath18 is the collision rate coefficient per unit mass .",
    "the system consisting of two constant density , constant pressure regions of uniform flow aligned with a uniform magnetic field is clearly a steady state solution of eqns .",
    "( 1 - 3 ) .",
    "we now consider small perturbations of the flow .",
    "we assume these perturbations are independent of @xmath19 . according to squires theorem ( drazin & reid 1981 ) and its extension to mhd ( hughes & tobias 2001 ) , in the absence of viscosity and resistivity these are the fastest growing perturbations . since the magnetic field enters the problem only through the tension force , which is independent of the structure in @xmath19 , ion - neutral friction should not affect this result .",
    "we expand the momentum and induction equations to first order in a small parameter @xmath20 , writing @xmath21 we assume all perturbed quantities @xmath22 take the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a constant amplitude .",
    "linearizing in @xmath20 gives @xmath25 which correspond to the equations ( 180 - 183 ) in ch .",
    "12 of chandrasekhar ( p. 508 - 9 ) . eliminating @xmath26 in equation ( 14 ) using equations ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) , constructing the @xmath27 component of the curl of the momentum equations , and applying @xmath28",
    ", we obtain @xmath29 these relations hold in each region , but not at the interface , where the velocity is not analytic . thus , to derive the dispersion relation , we must integrate each equation over an infinitesimal region surrounding @xmath5 and use standard gaussian pillbox arguments . denoting the jumps in quantities by @xmath30",
    ", we get @xmath31    we write the ion and neutral velocity amplitudes in the form + where the subscripts @xmath32 and @xmath33 refer to the jet and ambient medium , respectively .",
    "the forms of @xmath34 are chosen such that the ion and neutral displacements are continuous across the interface , as must hold on physical grounds .",
    "substituting these forms into equations ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) , we solve for @xmath35 , the neutral velocity fluctuations , in terms of @xmath36 , the ion velocity fluctuations . the result is @xmath37 we then use equations ( [ equ : zflows ] ) and ( [ equ : ba ] ) in equation ( [ equ : jump ] ) to obtain the dispersion relation @xmath38 where @xmath39 has been abbreviated to @xmath40 and @xmath41 abbreviated to k.    we now assume that the jet and ambient medium have the same density , work in the center of momentum frame so that @xmath42    and nondimensionalize the problem as follows : @xmath43 where the ion alfvn speed @xmath44 is defined as @xmath45 . the variables",

    "this leads to the somewhat more compact expression @xmath51 equation ( [ equ : drfinal ] ) is the basis of our subsequent stability analysis .",
    "we will be looking for solutions for @xmath8 which have a negative imaginary component , an indication of a growing instability .",
    "equations ( [ equ : drfull ] ) and ( [ equ : drfinal ] ) reduce , in special cases , to previously known results .",
    "these are discussed in  [ subsec : recovery ] . in  [ subsec : modes ] we present numerical and analytical solutions for the fastest growing modes . in  [ subsec : eigenfunctions ]",
    "we discuss the physical nature of the instabilities .",
    "if @xmath52 , equation ( [ equ : drfinal ] ) reverts to the dispersion relation for alfvn waves in a partially ionized medium ( kulsrud & pearce 1969 ) @xmath53 at sufficiently small wavenumber ( @xmath54 ; @xmath55 ) the wave speed is close to the neutral alfvn velocity @xmath56 because the neutral - ion collision timescale is less than the wave period and the ion and neutral species are closely coupled .",
    "we can derive this result from equation ( [ equ : hmdr ] ) by treating the second factor in parentheses as dominant .",
    "this leads to @xmath57 which is a weakly damped alfvn wave propagating at speed v@xmath58 .    at sufficiently large wavenumber ( @xmath59 ; @xmath60 ) ,",
    "the wave period is shorter than the ion - neutral collision timescale .",
    "thus , alfvnic disturbances are able to propagate through the ions without disturbing the neutrals and propagate at the ion alfvn velocity @xmath44",
    ". we can derive this result from equation ( [ equ : hmdr ] ) by treating the first factor in parentheses as dominant .",
    "this leads to @xmath61 which is a damped wave propagating at the ion alfvn velocity . in the intermediate wavenumber regime ( @xmath62 )",
    ", waves can not propagate because the ions are poorly coupled to neutrals and thus feel a strong drag .",
    "the shear instability in a fully - neutral medium ( or ionized but magnetic field free ) is present at any velocity and has growth rate @xmath63 ( @xmath64 in our notation ) . in order to recover the hydrodynamic instability we must use equation ( [ equ : drfull ] ) with @xmath65 .",

    "on the other hand , a fully ionized medium with a magnetic field parallel to the shear flow is stabilized by magnetic tension if @xmath68 . in order to recover the mhd instability",
    ", we set @xmath69 in equation ( [ equ : drfull ] ) and write the dispersion relation in the form @xmath70    note that the growth rates of both hydrodynamic and mhd instabilities increase linearly with wavenumber .      with  [ subsec : recovery ] as background",
    ", we now turn to the shear instability in the partially ionized regime .",
    "if there were no ion - neutral friction , the neutrals would always be unstable",
    ". the plasma would be stable if @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) , which we assume to be the case . since the growth rate of the hydrodynamic instability increases with @xmath73 , there is a wavenumber above which friction with the ions can not stabilize the perturbation .",
    "therefore , we expect short wavelength perturbations to grow at the hydrodynamic rate in the neutral fluid , but to leave the plasma and magnetic field in place .    at longer wavelengths , there is time for ion - neutral friction to act .",
    "if @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) , the magnetic field can not be expected to stabilize the medium no matter how well the ions and neutrals are coupled . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath76 , we might expect that at sufficiently long wavelengths the coupling is good enough to completely stabilize the system .",
    "we will see , however , that this is never the case .",
    "we carried out a parameter study of the roots of equation ( [ equ : drfinal ] ) as functions of @xmath47 and @xmath46 using the mathematica software package ( wolfram 1999 ) .",
    "surprisingly , the roots are closely approximated by the analytical expressions given in table  [ roots ] for the specified range of dimensionless parameters . in the results presented here , we focus on two sets of physical environments which we believe",
    "are illustrative of the range of conditions encountered in molecular outflows .",
    "the density of the ambient medium near massive protostars is a strong function of distance from the protostar .",
    "within radii of 100 - 1000 au densities are > 10@xmath77 @xmath78 , further out where outflows can be easily resolved and structure studied densities of 10@xmath79 @xmath78 are typical . in both examples , we take the molecular hydrogen density @xmath80 to be 10@xmath79 @xmath78 , the relative flow speed @xmath81 to be 20 km s@xmath82 , and the ratio @xmath83 of neutral to ionized mass density to be 10@xmath84 ( corresponding to an ionization fraction @xmath85 for an ion to neutral particle mass ratio @xmath86 ) .",
    "the collision frequency @xmath40 is @xmath87 s@xmath82 ( we use the rate coefficient of draine , roberge , & dalgarno ( 1983 ) ; @xmath88 @xmath89 s@xmath82 ) . with the these values ,",
    "the wavelength at which the hydrodynamic frequency @xmath63 matches the collison frequency ( @xmath90 ) is about 1.3 pc .",
    "the only difference between the two cases is in the magnetic fieldstrength , which we take to be 1 @xmath91 ( strong field case ) and 1 @xmath92 ( weak field case ) . with these parameters , @xmath93 and @xmath94 in the strong and weak field cases , respectively .",
    "since only growing modes will be dynamically important in the interface between a fast moving jet and the ambient ism , we restrict our discussion to two solutions , @xmath95 [ and the variant @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "confirmation that these expressions closely approximate the numerically derived roots is shown in figure [ growth ] .",
    "the numerically determined roots to the dispersion equation are shown as a function of wavelength ; overplotted are the analytical approximations to the two growing modes . the wavelengths @xmath98 and growth times @xmath99 are plotted in physical units for the two cases specified above .",
    "the analytical solutions can be derived from the dispersion relation by dropping small terms .",
    "the dominant terms used to derive each solution are given in table  [ roots ] .",
    "for example , the first root listed , @xmath95 , is the standard hydrodynamic instability derived from equation ( [ equ : drhydro ] ) . from the dispersion relation , we can see that the terms @xmath100 ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 ) dominant in the high magnetic field regime . of the @xmath104 terms ,",
    "the terms @xmath105 , @xmath106 dominate over the term @xmath107 because @xmath108 .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath109 , the terms @xmath107 , @xmath110 dominate , and the growing mode is @xmath111 .",
    "this second growing mode , @xmath97 , is a new mode that arises only in a weakly ionized medium .",
    "it originates when @xmath112 , or equivalently @xmath113 .",
    "the neutrals feel a constant drag force , independent of position , caused by collisions with the stationary ions .",
    "the instability has an origin similar to the standard hydrodynamic instability explained in  2 .",
    "the principal difference is that the neutral - ion collision time is shorter than the wave period .",
    "thus , neutral material collides with ions ( held stationary because of the magnetic field tension ) frequently during each perturbation period , which slows the growth of small perturbations .",
    "this slowing of the growth is clearly visible in figure  [ growth ] ( bottom panel ) where the growth time is longer for long wavelength ( and long period ) perturbations .",
    "the origin of this mode can be made more clear by assuming the ions are held strictly in place by the magnetic field and re - deriving the roots ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the break between the two growing modes occurs when @xmath90 or , equivalently , @xmath114 ( the wave period ) = @xmath115 ( the neutral - ion collision timescale ) .",
    "see figure  [ regime ] for physical parameters of this transition . since this mode grows more slowly than the @xmath95 mode",
    ", it is important only in the situation @xmath76 ( or @xmath116 ) , when the mhd mode is stable .    when @xmath117 and @xmath112 , @xmath118 is a better approximation to the growth rate .",
    "this is the analog of eqn .",
    "( [ equ : drplasma ] ) for a fully ionized medium .",
    "it is based on the limit of infinitely strong ion - neutral coupling .",
    "one of the main results of  [ subsec : modes ] is that the plasma and the neutrals can follow very different dynamics as the instability grows .",
    "although the interface between the two regions of flow is the same for the plasma as for the neutrals in the equilibrium system , the displaced interfaces for the plasma and neutral species can differ , as can their velocities .",
    "the negligibly small inertia of the ions renders any differences irrelevant to the basic mechanism of instability , but they are important for the nonlinear outcome of the instability , and for its spectroscopic signatures .    on physical grounds , we expect large differences between @xmath119 and @xmath120 when ion - neutral coupling is weak ( @xmath121 ) and magnetic forces are strong . whether these differences persist at small @xmath46 depends on the relative values of @xmath122 and @xmath46 .",
    "if their ratio is less than unity the field is too weak to suppress instability even in the limit of infinitely strong ion - neutral coupling , and we expect @xmath123 . if @xmath124 the instability acts on the neutrals but leaves the ions behind , and we expect large differences between @xmath119 and @xmath120 even at short wavelengths .",
    "these expectations are borne out by analysis . according to equation ( [ equ : zflows ] ) , the amplitudes of the ion and neutral displacements are @xmath36 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "their ratio follows from equation ( [ equ : ba ] ) , which for the problem at hand can be written in dimensionless form using equations ( [ equ : dimless ] ) as @xmath125 the modulus of the relative amplitude is plotted as functions of wavelength in figure [ amp ] for the @xmath126 and @xmath74 cases , respectively .",
    "when the field is strong and @xmath46 is large ( short wavelength ) , the ions are held firmly in place and the instability is almost entirely in the neutrals , so @xmath127 is large .",
    "the numerical results are well fit by the asymptotic formula @xmath128 .",
    "as @xmath46 decreases the coupling improves , but the magnetic restoring force is still very large and the ion response never matches the neutrals . in this regime , @xmath129 .",
    "recall ( see figure 2 ) that in this limit the instability is of the weak form @xmath130",
    ".    when the field is weak , magnetic forces are relatively unimportant . in this case",
    ", @xmath127 is nearly unity over most of the range considered , although figure [ amp ] ( bottom panel ) shows a slight upturn at the shortest wavelengths , at which ion - neutral friction is relatively weak .",
    "the location of the upturn shows the expected scaling with @xmath26 .",
    "for example , at @xmath131 , @xmath132 for @xmath133 , increasing to 25 if @xmath134 and 50 if @xmath135 .",
    "in all three cases , however , @xmath127 drops to unity for @xmath136 1 ( @xmath137 au ) .",
    "not until the field is strong enough to stabilize the bulk medium @xmath138 does @xmath127 exceed unity for @xmath109 .    in deriving both the numerical and asymptotic results in the cases where @xmath139 , the @xmath106 and @xmath110 terms in the denominator of eqn .",
    "( [ equ : baratio ] ) nearly cancel .",
    "thus , the right hand side of the equation ( [ equ : baratio ] ) must be computed using roots to the exact dispersion relation ( equation ( [ equ : drfull ] ) ) .",
    "the critical result from this analysis is that if @xmath140 then at relevant length scales and timescales for bipolar outflows ( @xmath141 1000 au and @xmath142 1000 years ) , the fluctuations are primarily in the neutrals and not in the ions or magnetic field .",
    "in contrast to the mhd shear flow instabilities simulated by jones et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and malagoli et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the magnetic field can not wind up and dissipate on small scales , and the instability is primarily hydrodynamic in character .",
    "we now turn to the observational implications of this conclusion .",
    "the calculations presented here do not permit quantitative predictions for observational signatures of the two instabilities for ambient ism entrainment by massive bipolar outflows .",
    "we would need to develop numerical models with two fluid mhd that incorporate non - planar geometry and non - linear growth , and would need chemical models and radiative transfer calculations to predict the resulting spectra .",
    "such an analysis is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , several physical signatures should be robust , and may be observable .      as we showed in  3.3 , unless @xmath26 is less than about 10 @xmath143 g , over most of the parameter space of interest only neutrals participate in the resulting turbulence .",
    "that is , only neutrals will have a velocity significantly different from either the outflow jet or the ambient ism . for example ,",
    "if outflow jets had uniform velocity emerging from the protostar , then the emission from ionized molecules should not be detectable at velocities different from the outflow velocity . this signature should be particularly distinctive if there are ion species that are present in only one of these media .",
    "outflow jets probably have a range in velocity , however , which will make isolating a velocity unique to the interface region difficult .",
    "if the transition between the jet and the ambient medium can be resolved , we might expect relatively large differences between the profiles of charged and neutral species .",
    "the ion flow would be laminar , and would show a smooth transition between the velocity of the core of the jet and the velocity of the ambient medium .",
    "the neutral flow would show the same range of velocities , but would be turbulent , leading to broader lines .",
    "figure [ amp ] predict that throughout most of parameter space , the magnetic field prevents the ions from participating in unstable perturbations .",
    "the resulting velocity difference between the ions and neutrals creates friction that can heat the gas .",
    "the heating rate per unit volume is given by @xmath144 for example , assuming @xmath145 km s@xmath82 , @xmath146 @xmath78 , @xmath147 10@xmath148 @xmath78 gives @xmath149 ergs @xmath78 s@xmath82 .",
    "assuming that the heating is balanced by radiative cooling , the corresponding luminosity density is 0.04 @xmath150 pc@xmath151 .",
    "the frictional heating rate dominates cosmic ray heating . taking the latter from spitzer ( 1978 ) we find @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the neutral velocity in km / s . unlike viscous heating , which is also strong in a turbulent boundary layer , @xmath154 is independent of the thickness of the layer .",
    "the orientation of the magnetic field in the outflow could be mapped by measuring the polarization of infrared radiation emitted by the dust grains . according to our analysis",
    ", the magnetic field should remain well organized even though the neutral flow is turbulent , provided that the mean field is aligned with the flow ( if the field were transverse to the flow , the plasma would be unstable , and would carry the field with it , but the turbulent motions would be perpendicular to the field , and would not strongly bend it ) .",
    "observations of a turbulent field in the outflow could be explained if the ionization fraction were much larger than assumed here , resulting in stronger coupling , or if the grains were aligned by the turbulent neutral flow rather than by the magnetic field .",
    "observations of a straight field , however , demonstrate only that the field is well organized at or above the scale resolved by the observations ( heitsch et al .",
    "a low polarized intensity could be evidence for a disordered field below the resolved scale , but could also be due to poor alignment of the grains ( padoan et al .",
    "outflows from massive protostars are observed to carry a large mass flux and to be poorly collimated .",
    "both properties suggest that these outflows entrain substantial volumes of ambient ism material .",
    "turbulence driven by shear flow instabilities at the interface between the jet and the surrounding medium is one possible mechanism for entrainment .    in this paper",
    "we have examined the kelvin - helmholtz instability in a weakly ionized medium with parameters chosen to be similar to molecular outflows . in order to study effects introduced by two fluids ( plasma and neutral ) , we chose the simplest possible geometry : two uniform media ( taken in all examples to have the same density ) in relative motion at speed @xmath6 , separated by a sharp interface , with a uniform magnetic field parallel to the flow . under these conditions ,",
    "a plasma is unstable if the relative velocity exceeds the alfvn speed ( chandrasekhar 1961 ) . for the parameters of interest to our problem ,",
    "the plasma is magnetically stabilized while the neutrals , in the absence of frictional coupling to the ions , would always be unstable . in the limit of perfect frictional coupling ,",
    "the combined system - with the alfvn speed based on the total mass density instead of the plasma density - could be either stable or unstable , according to whether the bulk alfvn speed @xmath155 exceeds @xmath6 .",
    "most of the analysis in our paper is based on the dispersion relation derived in  2 , equation ( [ equ : drfinal ] ) .",
    "our main result is that for much of the size range of interest , the ions and neutrals are sufficently decoupled that the neutrals are unstable , while the ions are held in place by the magnetic field . at short scales ,",
    "the growth rate is well approximated by the growth rate of the hydrodynamic instability , @xmath63 . at longer scales ,",
    "the fastest growing mode is either the magnetically modified mhd mode , if the magnetic field is weak enough ( @xmath156 ) , or , if @xmath157 , a new mode with growth rate @xmath158 .",
    "the transition between these modes of instability occurs at @xmath159 .",
    "the dispersion diagram is plotted in figure [ growth ] .",
    "the relative amplitudes of the ion and neutral fluctuations are shown in figure [ amp ] , demonstrating that over most of the regime of interest , the ions drop out of the instability .",
    "we believe these results continue to hold in cylindrical geometry .",
    "in fact , they should be even more pronounced because at short wavelengths the cylindrical and planar cases coincide , while at long wavelengths the instability is suppressed by geometry .",
    "we also expect that more general perturbations , such as those with a large transverse wavenumber @xmath160 , would be characterized by similar ion - neutral decoupling .",
    "although we have not followed the instability into the nonlinear stage , there is no reason why frictional coupling should be more efficient at large amplitude , so we expect our results to apply to the nonlinear regime .",
    "there is , however , a compelling case to be made for nonlinear calculations : they are necessary to produce detailed observational predictions . as such",
    ", they should follow the thermal and chemical state of the gas , as well as its dynamics .",
    "based on the linear theory , however , it appears that our model may be tested in several ways , mentioned in  4 ; differences in line profiles between charged and neutral species , efficient heating by ion - neutral friction , and the polarimetric signature of a well organized magnetic field .",
    "we will report on spectroscopic evidence in a forthcoming paper ( watson et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "our results do , however , leave us with a conundrum .",
    "churchwell ( 1997 ) pointed out that the rate of entrainment required to explain the mass flux in outflows is unreasonably large , if the entrainment is hydrodynamic in nature .",
    "the low degree of ion - neutral coupling predicted by our model suggests that the entrainment is more hydrodynamic than magnetohydrodynamic , although nonlinear simulations and analysis are necessary to settle the issue .",
