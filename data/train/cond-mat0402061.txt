    "a directed branched polymer or a directed animal on a lattice , rooted at the origin is a connected cluster such that any site of the animal can be reached from the root by a walk which never goes opposite to the preferred direction .",
    "for example , on a square lattice drawn tilted at @xmath10 in fig .",
    "1 , a directed site animal or a directed branched polymer @xmath11 rooted at the origin is a set of occupied sites including origin , such that for each occupied site @xmath12 other than the origin , at least one of the two sites @xmath13 and @xmath14 is also occupied .",

    "1 ) . we will consider only polymers rooted at the surface in this paper .",
    "we assign a fugacity @xmath19 to all allowed sites of the cluster . further ,",
    "if we associate an additional energy @xmath20 with each site on the surface , each site on surface will have an additional weight and the fugacity of sites about the diagonal , denoted by @xmath21 is equal to @xmath22 where @xmath23 hence @xmath24 would correspond to an attractive surface .",
    "we define @xmath25 , the grand partition function of the polymer as    @xmath26    where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the partition function of the polymer made of exactly @xmath29 monomers .    for @xmath30 , we get the statistics of equally weighted animals and @xmath31 is the number of distinct directed animals having @xmath29 sites with given boundary conditions . for large @xmath29",
    ", @xmath28 varies as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is known as entropic critical exponent .",
    "similarly , the transverse size of the polymer for large @xmath29 scales as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the exponent which defines the transverse length scale of the polymer .",
    "these exponents take different values in desorbed , adsorbed and in the critical regions .",
    "we will use subscripts @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 to represent critical exponents and other quantities in desorbed , critical and adsorbed phases of the polymer .    and the free energy per monomer of the polymer in thermodynamic limit is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the value of fugacity at which @xmath25 has a singularity for a given value of @xmath8 .",

    "@xmath49 corresponds to the desorbed phase of the polymer in which only a finite number of monomers stick to the surface . at @xmath50 , the critical point of the surface transition ,",
    "the number of adsorbed monomers as function of polymer size in large @xmath29 limit have a behavior given by    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is known as the crossover exponent of the surface transition .    in the @xmath53 limit ,",

    "the directed site animal enumeration ( dsae ) problem in @xmath0-dimensions is related to time development of thermal relaxation of a hard core lattice gas ( hclg ) with nearest neighbor exclusion on @xmath1 dimensional lattice @xcite . in @xcite , we have shown that this correspondence relates the density at a site @xmath68 in steady state to sum of weights of all animals rooted at @xmath68 , the grand partition function of the animal .",
    "also , the average number of sites at a given transverse distance @xmath69 from the origin for a @xmath0 dimensional directed animal is related to the density - density correlation function of the lattice gas in @xmath1 dimensions .    specifically , if on a @xmath0 dimensional body - centered hyper - cubic lattice we define weight of an animal @xmath11 as the product of weights of all occupied sites , with weight corresponding to a site with @xmath69 coordinate @xmath68 being @xmath70 , then the dsae problem on this @xmath0 dimensional lattice gets related to time development of hclg with nearest neighbor exclusion on a @xmath1 dimensional body - centered hyper - cubic lattice with the rates which satisfy detailed balance condition corresponding to the hamiltonian    @xmath71    where @xmath72 and the animal number generating function is just the negative of density of hclg with change of variables from @xmath73 to @xmath19 .",
    "here we have used the convention that if @xmath74 then the corresponding term in the hamiltonian is zero .",
    "the configurations with any pair of occupied nearest neighbor have infinite energy and do not contribute to the partition function .",
    "the partition function is linear in all @xmath75 .",
    "the linearity of the partition function in @xmath75 implies that in case when the activity about @xmath76 is different from that in the rest of the sample , i.e if we let the activity about @xmath76 be @xmath77 and activity in rest of space be @xmath73 , then the partition function of the hclg can be written as    @xmath78    where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are polynomials in @xmath73 .",
    "if @xmath81 represents the density of hclg when the activity about each site is the same , then the density of hclg about the origin in the present case @xmath82 can be written in terms of @xmath81 as    @xmath83    same observation has been made by cardy in @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , since @xmath25 is just the negative of @xmath82 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 , we can express @xmath25 in terms of @xmath86 and this is given by    @xmath87    moreover , the density - density correlation function of hclg @xmath88 with @xmath89 can be expressed in terms of density density correlation function when @xmath30 .",
    "we find that the density density correlation function is related to @xmath43 on a hyper - cubic lattice as follows @xmath90 from this we get @xmath91}{[1+wy+a(1,y)(1-w)]^2 } \\label{corr}\\ ] ]    since @xmath81 is the density of the hclg , then as discussed in @xcite , for @xmath76 , the density density correlation of hclg is always equal to @xmath92 for any @xmath1 dimensional case and hence @xmath93 can be completely expressed in terms of @xmath86 .",

    "we will use these results in rest of the paper to study the surface effects for dbp in @xmath4 and @xmath5 dimensions .    in the adsorbed regime",
    "the number of monomers in direct contact with the wall is proportional to @xmath29 and @xmath96 .",
    "this implies that the scaling form of @xmath97 in the adsorbed regime would be    @xmath98    where @xmath99 is the chracterstic length scale in the system .",
    "since we are away from the critical regime , @xmath100 is well behaved and never diverges for finite @xmath8 .",
    "also @xmath100 is independent of the size @xmath29 of the polymers .",
    "the normalization of scaling function @xmath101 is chosen such that @xmath102    @xmath103 is the coefficient of @xmath104 in the expansion of @xmath105 . in the adsorbed regime , @xmath106 for large @xmath29 and behavior of @xmath107 is given by eq .",

    "for a penetrable surface , since the configurations spanning through the surface are allowed , there is no loss of entropy per monomer to take into account ( fig 1 ) .",
    "hence , @xmath30 corresponds to a zero gain in free energy per monomer of the surface .",
    "we find that the value of @xmath19 at which @xmath86 diverges , the only value of @xmath8 which makes @xmath25 also divergent is @xmath30 .",

    "even though entropy loss and energy gain balances each other at @xmath30 , the polymer might start binding to a line only at wall activity greater than @xmath119 . for directed branched polymers ,",
    "when @xmath86 has no divergence , @xmath30 is not the critical point of the surface transition .",

    "this unusual result can be understood as coming from exact cancellation of decrease in entropy and increase in internal energy at the critical point .",
    "also note that the value of exponent @xmath194 for dbp is equal to the estimates of @xmath52 for branched polymers @xcite and linear polymers @xcite in @xmath4 dimensions .",
    "infact for adsorption of an undirected @xmath1 dimensional branched polymer to a @xmath195 dimensional surface , the crossover exponent @xmath52 is conjectured to be @xmath151 in all spatial dimensions @xcite .    for @xmath162 ,",

    "whereas at the critical point it peaks at the surface ( fig 4 ) .",

    "<S> here we are able to show it explicitly for directed branched polymers . in section 5 </S>",
    "<S> using baxter s solution of hard hexagon gas we study @xmath3 dimensional dbp in presence of line and calculate the crossover exponent and sticking fraction for the directed branched polymer exactly . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling function of sticking fraction is a function of two intensive thermodynamic variables . </S>",
    "<S> we have derived its exact form in @xmath2 dimension and @xmath3 dimension . </S>",
    "<S> there are very few such exact nontrivial scaling functions of more than one thermodynamic variable known @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also get the large @xmath8 expansion of the sticking fraction as a power series in @xmath9 . </S>"
