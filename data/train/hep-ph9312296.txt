    "our analysis of the full @xmath8 parameter space extends and confirms the results of ref .",
    "[ [ eqz3 ] ] : in the region of the mssm parameter space allowed by the present experimental constraints , there is very little room for fulfilling the constraint ( [ erre ] ) , which is a necessary condition for electroweak baryogenesis . to put these results in a clearer perspective ,",

    "first , one could think of relaxing the constraint @xmath131 ( and the corresponding lep bounds ) , which is usually motivated by the theoretical assumption of universal soft higgs masses at the susy - gut scale , @xmath132 .",
    "the possibility of @xmath133 , however , is incompatible with a heavy top quark , since , for @xmath134 and supersymmetric particle masses of order @xmath135 , the running top yukawa coupling would become non - perturbative at scales smaller than @xmath136 : such a possibility is strongly disfavoured by the successful predictions of the low - energy gauge couplings in susy guts .",
    "a second possibility is that large non - perturbative effects , neglected by conventional calculational techniques , modify the predicted values of the sphaleron energy and/or of @xmath137 ( for recent suggestions along this line , see [ [ nonpert ] ] ) .",
    "we do not see strong physical arguments to favour this , but we admit that it can not be rigorously excluded . perhaps alternative approaches to the electroweak phase transition [ [ altern ] ] could help clarify this point in the future .    barring the above - mentioned possibilities , one could still try to rescue electroweak baryogenesis by further enlarging the mssm higgs sector , for example by introducing an extra singlet .",
    "supersymmetric models with singlets and non - supersymmetric models , however , develop dangerous instabilities if coupled to the superheavy sector of an underlying unified theory .",
    "it might well be that baryogenesis has to be described by physics at a scale larger than the electroweak one .",
