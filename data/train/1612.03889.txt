    "hot and dense strongly interacting matter is studied experimentally in heavy - ion collisions at different beam energies @xmath0 .",
    "one of the major scientific goals of these experiments is to explore the phases of qcd matter as a function of temperature @xmath1 and baryon chemical potential @xmath2 . at vanishing @xmath2 the transition between the high-@xmath1 partonic and low-@xmath1 hadronic phases",
    "is an analytic crossover  @xcite , but many models predict that the transition is first order at large @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "experimental searches for the first - order phase transition and the associated critical endpoint are based on the observation that the baryon chemical potential at chemical freeze - out increases with decreasing @xmath0 in the regime probed at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the sps fixed target program at cern .",
    "promising observable signatures for the presence of a critical point include event - by - event fluctuations  @xcite , in particular fluctuations of conserved quantum numbers such as baryon number or electric charge  @xcite .",
    "the influence of a phase transition , or a change of its order , should be reflected in a non - monotonic @xmath0-dependence of these observables  @xcite .",
    "moreover , non - uniform structures in e.g.  the net - baryon number distributions due to domain formation in the spinodal region of the phase diagram may be expected  @xcite .",
    "motivated by these ideas a substantial experimental effort has been directed at studying event - by - event multiplicity fluctuations of identified particle species  @xcite . considered as a proxy for net - baryon number fluctuations ,",
    "net - proton number fluctuations are particularly interesting .",
    "for these , intriguing non - monotonic patterns were observed within phase  i of the rhic beam energy scan ( bes ) program as @xmath0 was decreased  @xcite . to deduce from the observed behavior unambiguously",
    "the presence of a first - order phase transition or a critical point is , nonetheless , a non - trivial task which requires additional work . on the experimental side",
    "the main issue is to reduce systematic and statistical uncertainties , which is one of the central goals of the upcoming phase  ii of the bes .",
    "moreover , the strong sensitivity of the current data on reconstruction efficiency , kinematic acceptance or collision - centrality needs to be better understood . on the theoretical side",
    "a list of challenges has to be resolved before the data can be interpreted meaningfully .",
    "for example , net - proton number fluctuations serve , at best , as a proxy for net - baryon number fluctuations .",
    "in particular at lower @xmath0 , aspects of exact charge conservation  @xcite , repulsive interactions  @xcite or late stage hadronic phase processes such as resonance regeneration  @xcite or decay have to be considered carefully .",
    "further details and more fluctuation sources were discussed in the recent review  @xcite .",
    "the present work addresses one of the theoretical challenges to data interpretation , namely the role of resonance decays .",
    "resonance decays contribute significantly to the final state particle multiplicities and , consequently , to event - by - event multiplicity distributions .",
    "their impact on net - proton number fluctuations , ignoring the possible presence of a critical point , was previously studied in  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the decay processes do not significantly modify the primordial ( without resonance decays ) ratios of net - proton number cumulants if the probabilistic decay contributions are properly taken into account  @xcite .",
    "this is because a thermal distribution of particles is being folded with a binomial decay distribution yielding again a nearly thermal distribution .",
    "however , critical fluctuations lead to sizeable deviations from the thermal baseline . in",
    "@xcite it was argued that the isospin randomization through resonance regeneration processes suppresses strongly the critical fluctuation signals in the net - proton number distribution , in particular , in the higher - order cumulants .",
    "it is natural to ask if resonance decays similarly obscure critical point signals in fluctuation observables .",
    "critical fluctuations can be described in terms of an order parameter field @xmath3 . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "the equilibrium correlation length @xmath4 of the order parameter diverges at the critical point . under the assumption that qcd belongs to the same universality class as the three - dimensional ising model",
    "@xcite one finds that the cumulants of the order parameter fluctuations scale as @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where small anomalous dimension corrections are neglected in these scaling relations  @xcite .",
    "thus , higher - order cumulants depend more sensitively on the value of the equilibrium correlation length .",
    "this is important for heavy - ion collisions , because the actual value of @xmath4 is limited due to finite size and time effects .",
    "most significantly , the temporal growth of the correlation length is controlled by the relaxation time @xmath8 , which increases as a power of the equilibrium correlation length . near the critical point @xmath9 with @xmath10  @xcite , and critical slowing down places significant limits on the actual growth of the correlation length . in  @xcite ,",
    "the non - equilibrium evolution of the correlation length was studied and a maximal value of about @xmath11  fm was found .",
    "thus , critical fluctuation signals in observables will be weaker than expected based on equilibrium considerations . within the model of non - equilibrium chiral fluid dynamics  @xcite fluctuations of the order parameter are explicitly propagated in a fluid dynamical evolution of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the effect of such a dynamics on the time evolution of net - proton fluctuations has been investigated recently  @xcite .",
    "it was found that critical fluctuations are affected by the dynamics , and that the location on the hydrodynamic trajectory where fluctuations freeze out determines the magnitude and shape of the fluctuation signals .",
    "however , it was also found that a critical point signal remains visible on top of thermal and initial state fluctuations .",
    "an analytic model for the time evolution of order parameter fluctuations was recently studied in  @xcite .",
    "the authors found that relaxation time effects introduce a significant lag in the cumulants relative to equilibrium expectations , and that non - equilibrium effects modify the simple scaling relations discussed in  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we assume that there is a critical point in the qcd phase diagram , that this point causes critical fluctuations in the primordial net - proton number at chemical freeze - out , and that these fluctuations are determined by the growth of the correlation length .",
    "we study quantitatively the impact of resonance decays on the higher - order net - proton number cumulant ratios .",
    "we do not take into account dynamical effects such as the role of the relaxation time and critical slowing down .",
    "we assume that a ) the fluctuations reflect thermal equilibrium at chemical freeze - out , and that b ) freeze - out takes place in proximity to the qcd phase transition .",
    "these assumptions are motivated by the success of fluid dynamics , based on the assumption of rapid local thermalization , in describing bulk observables  @xcite , and by the successful extraction of freeze - out parameters from fluctuation observables  @xcite .",
    "certainly , results obtained in the limit of rapid local thermalization provide an important benchmark for more sophisticated studies based on non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "in this section , we discuss in detail the framework used in our work .",
    "we start by describing the thermal , i.e.  non - critical , baseline which we assume to be given by a grandcanonical hadron resonance gas model .",
    "it was shown that such a model is quite successful in quantitatively describing both lattice qcd results of the thermodynamics in the hadronic phase  @xcite and measured particle yields  @xcite .",
    "critical fluctuations are then included by making use of universality class arguments and coupling ( anti-)particles with the order parameter field , the critical mode , via a phenomenological approach .",
    "we discuss how the critical fluctuations can be quantified at the chemical freeze - out and , furthermore , propose different phenomenological anstze to study , in addition , the impact resonance decays have on the net - proton number fluctuations in the presence of a critical point .      as a baseline theory that exhibits no critical behavior we consider a hadron resonance gas model containing baryons and mesons up to masses of approximately @xmath12  gev in line with  @xcite .",

    "the cumulants with @xmath26 , measuring thermal ensemble fluctuations in the particle number , can be related to derivatives of @xmath27 with respect to @xmath28 for fixed @xmath1 , @xmath29 in this work , we are interested in the first four cumulants @xmath30 of the net - proton number @xmath31 , which read ( note that cumulant and central moment are the same for order @xmath32 ) @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",

    "( [ equ : c2def ] )  -  ( [ equ : c4def ] ) are specific for our baseline model , for which correlations among different particle species vanish .",

    ", we may define @xmath36 and compare model calculations for the cumulant ratios with combinations of mean @xmath37 , variance @xmath38 , skewness @xmath39 and kurtosis @xmath40 of measured event - by - event multiplicity distributions .",
    "an advantage of considering ratios is that to first approximation volume fluctuations , which are inherent in the individual cumulants @xmath30 , cancel out .      in the scaling region near a critical point different physical systems , which belong to the same universality class ,",
    "exhibit a universal critical behavior  @xcite .",
    "assuming that qcd belongs to the same universality class as the three - dimensional ising model allows us to relate the order parameter @xmath3 of the chiral phase transition in qcd with the order parameter of the spin model , the magnetization @xmath41 . in the ising model ,",
    "the magnetization is a function of reduced temperature @xmath42 and reduced external magnetic field @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the critical temperature in the spin model and @xmath45 is a normalization constant . in these variables ,",
    "the critical point is located at @xmath46 . for @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    "the transition is of first order , while @xmath49 marks the crossover regime .",
    "the equilibrium cumulants of the critical mode are then obtained as @xmath50 from appropriate derivatives of @xmath41 with respect to the classical field keeping @xmath51 fixed  @xcite .",
    "a parametric representation of @xmath41 based on  @xcite can be found in appendix  [ sec : appa ] .",
    "this gives rise to parametric expressions for the cumulants of the critical mode , which are also given in appendix  [ sec : appa ] .",
    "these expressions are , strictly speaking , only valid for the scaling region close to the critical point .",
    "nevertheless , we employ them for all considered @xmath0 because a ) the size of the scaling region is not known , and b ) the influence of critical fluctuations on observables is suppressed further away from the critical point as we discuss in section  [ sec : results ] .",

    "instead , we focus on observables that couple to the critical mode , such as the number of pions or protons  @xcite . in general",
