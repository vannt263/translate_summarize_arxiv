    "for stochastic growth models in the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) universality class over a one - dimensional substrate the height fluctuations `` always '' broaden as @xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand the full probability density function depends on the choice of the initial data .",
    "as well known , for a flat initial surface , @xmath2 , the large @xmath3 fluctuations of @xmath4 are distributed according to goe tracy - widom distribution  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , if the height profile is macroscopically curved , then goe has to be replaced by gue  @xcite .",
    "such dependence is not so easily inferred directly from the growth dynamics .",
    "but if one switches to the equivalent model of a directed polymer in a space - time random potential , then one end point of the polymer is fixed , while the constraints for the other end point depend on the initial conditions .",
    "for example , in the curved case the other end point is fixed and in the flat case the other end point is sampled along a straight line .",
    "the size of the polymer free energy fluctuations is robust , but the probability density is sensitive to the particular end point sampling .",
    "in our contribution we study such dependence on initial conditions in the case when the local slopes are statistically translation invariant .",
    "besides flat , the only other known explicit example refers to initial heights which fluctuate as two - sided brownian motion .",
    "if as a surface growth model we consider the one - dimensional kpz equation , @xmath5 with @xmath6 normalized space - time white noise , then the time - stationary initial data are @xmath7 with @xmath8 a two - sided brownian motion .",
    "as shown in  @xcite ( for other models in the kpz class , see  @xcite ) , @xmath9 for large @xmath3 and the random amplitude @xmath10 is baik - rains distributed  @xcite .",
    "recently , quastel and remenik  @xcite identified a large domain of attraction for the goe tracy - widom distribution . roughly speaking , an initial profile , @xmath11 , which grows slower than @xmath12 for large  @xmath13 exhibits height fluctuations",
    "which are goe tracy - widom distributed .",
    "our interests are translation invariant random initial data , for which height differences typically grow as @xmath12 .",
    "this is physically a rather natural assumption , since it is realized by initial slopes being approximately independent .",
    "in fact , we will exclusively focus on the one - sided growing single - step model , _ alias _ tasep , with initial slope (= particle ) configuration @xmath14 taking values @xmath15 .",
    "the restriction to translation invariant initial slopes means that @xmath16 is a stationary stochastic process satisfying the functional central limit theorem @xmath17 }   \\big(\\eta_j - \\langle\\eta_0\\rangle\\big ) = \\sigma b(x)\\ ] ] for some @xmath18 .",
    "here @xmath19 is a scaling constant set such that @xmath20 corresponds to stationary initial conditions . as to be shown ,",
    "if @xmath21 , then the height fluctuations are goe tracy - widom distributed , thereby strengthening the results of  @xcite . in our contribution we will argue , and prove under additional assumptions , that for translation invariant random initial data the universality classes are labeled by @xmath22 . for each @xmath22",
    "there is a distinct distribution function @xmath23 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath24 the expected density of particles and by @xmath25 the expected ( infinitesimal ) current of particles .",
    "time correlations are significant only close to the ray @xmath26 .",
    "thus if @xmath27 , the height fluctuations close to the origin , as obtained from @xmath28 , are governed by @xmath23 in the large @xmath3 limit . in case @xmath29",
    ", @xmath23 will be observed after properly centering ( see e.g.  @xcite in the case @xmath20 ) .",
    "in section  [ sectvarformula ] we prove that the limiting distribution is determined through a variational formula , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the airy process and is independent of the two - sided brownian motion @xmath8 . the proof is written using the last passage percolation picture .",
    "it uses several non - trivial results obtained only recently , the most important ones being tightness  @xcite for the point - to - point process with ending points on horizontal lines , and the one - point slow - decorrelation  @xcite .",
    "finally one also needs to know the convergence of the finite - dimensional distributions  @xcite .",
    "these ingredients can be used to obtain a functional slow - decorrelation result ( theorem  [ thmslowdecorrelation ] ) , see  @xcite for the discrete time counterpart .",
    "interestingly , this latter result then implies tightness of the point - to - point process along generic lines , see e.g.  corollary  [ cortightness ] , which is a result not covered by the elegant and soft arguments of  @xcite .    as already proved in  @xcite , @xmath32 , with @xmath33 the goe tracy - widom distribution .",
    "our result indirectly implies that @xmath34 equals the baik - rains distribution .",
    "the only other explicit solution corresponds formally to the limit @xmath35 , which reads ( after scaling @xmath36 with @xmath37 , see also section  [ sectlargesigma ] ) @xmath38 an explicit representation is provided in  @xcite .",
    "its probability density vanishes for @xmath39 and decays as a stretched exponential with power @xmath40 for @xmath41 .    for all other values of @xmath22 we have to rely on monte carlo simulations , which will be reported in section  [ sectsimulation ] .",
    "a convenient choice is to simulate the tasep dynamics and to independently sample @xmath42 as a reversible markov chain .",
    "the average density is taken as @xmath43 and varying the only remaining parameter one can achieve . to check the claimed universality",

    "one could drop the assumption of translation - invariance for the initial height profile , such that the limit on the right side of ( [ eq2.7 ] ) will be another non - degenerate limit process , say @xmath112 .",

    "the key ingredients to prove theorem  [ thmvarproblem ] are ( a ) functional slow - decorrelation , ( b ) bounds that ensures that the optimizer stays within a specific region . due to lemma  [ lemmabrownianscaling ] , we know that the random line for the discrete model converges weakly to a brownian motion as a continuous function",

    "one main difference between our proof and the one of the case of geometric random variables of  @xcite , is that we do not use the gibbs property of the associated multilayer model to bound the probability of lpp from small segments through point - to - point probabilities , rather we bound this probability directly using the fact that the kernel for the half - line problem is known .",
