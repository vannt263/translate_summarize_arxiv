    "the ultimate goal of investigating properties of neutron - rich nucleonic matter through terrestrial nuclear laboratory experiments and astrophysical observations is to understand the underlying isospin dependence of strong interaction in nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) of neutron - rich nucleonic matter can be written within the parabolic approximation in terms of the binding energy per nucleon at density @xmath0 as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the neutron - proton asymmetry and @xmath9 is the density - dependent nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "the latter has important applications in many areas of both nuclear physics , see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and astrophysics , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "however , the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy has been among the most uncertain properties of neutron - rich nucleonic matter .",
    "predictions using various many - body theories and interactions diverge quite broadly especially at abnormal densities .",
    "it is thus exciting to see that significant progress has been made recently in constraining the around @xmath4 , see , e.g. , ref .",

    "it is thus interesting to ask timely what we can learn about the isospin dependence of in - medium nuclear interaction from the extracted constrains on 0 and 0 .",
    "here we study this question at the mean - field level by using a formulism developed earlier in refs .",
    "@xcite based on the hugenholtz - van hove ( hvh ) theorem @xcite .",
    "specifically , we try to infer both the magnitude of the symmetry potential @xmath12 and the neutron - proton effective k - mass splitting @xmath5 corresponding to each of the 28 constraints on 0 and 0 at @xmath4 .",
    "the consistency of the extracted values for @xmath12 and @xmath5 from various constraints is then examined .",
    "it is found that while the mean values of the @xmath12 and @xmath5 from different studies are consistent with each other and most of them scatter closely around 0=29 mev and @xmath6 , respectively , the individual uncertainties from many analyses are still too large .",
    "quantifying , better understanding and reducing the uncertainties in extracting the symmetry energy from model analyses of the experimental data are much needed in order to use reliably the extracted mean values of the @xmath12 and @xmath5 in solving many important problems in both nuclear physics and astrophysics .",
