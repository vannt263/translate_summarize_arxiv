    "a typical computation in the standard model generates many gauge - dependent terms that get cancelled at the end .",
    "the labour of calculation can be thus considerably reduced if suitable gauges are chosen to minimize the presence of these terms . as far as propagators goes it is usually simplest to use the feynman gauge . as to vertices and external gluon wave functions , more unconventional gauges",
    "can often lead to greater simplifications .",
    "the spinor helicity technique @xcite is a case in point .",
    "external gluon wave functions are chosen in lightcone gauges defined by lightlike reference momenta @xmath0 , which may be different for different gluons .",
    "a judicious choice of @xmath0 s can reduce the number of terms present , and sometimes even renders whole diagrams zero .",
    "this technique was originally designed @xcite for tree - level calculations but with superstring @xcite and first - quantized @xcite techniques it can be extended at least to one - loop diagrams , and with schwinger representation it can be extended to multiloops @xcite .",
    "further simplifications might be obtained by choosing gauges that affect the vertices .",
    "the best known example of this kind is probably the background gauge ( bg ) @xcite , in which a triple - gluon ( 3 g ) vertex attached to an external gluon contains four terms , two less than the six terms present in a normal 3 g vertex .",
    "this gauge is particularly convenient for one - loop @xmath1-gluon 1pi amplitudes , where each 3 g vertex present is such a bg 3 g vertex .",
    "in addition to this reduction in number , of the four terms in such a vertex , only one involves the internal line and needs to be integrated over . for other diagrams",
    "a different gauge may be more convenient .",
    "for example , in some sense the gevais - neveu gauge @xcite is the simplest one for @xmath1-gluon diagrams in the tree approximation .",
    "it is quite remarkable that in tree and one - loop order , the superstring formalism automatically chooses in some sense these best gauges to compute @xcite .    from these examples",
    "it is clear that the most suitable gauge to use depends on the process and the details of the feynman diagrams . in order to devise new gauges suitable for a new set of feynman diagrams ,",
    "a systematic study of the mechanism for the cancellation of gauge - dependent terms is needed . since",
    "feynman diagrams are much simpler and more intuitive to visualize than the corresponding analytic expressions , it would be best for the same reason if such gauge cancellations can be cast in diagrammatic languages .",
    "this is what we intend to develop in the first part of this article .",
    "how this task is accomplished is well known in qed but not in qcd . in qcd , a one - loop _ pinching technique _",
    "@xcite is known to simplify calculations by converting ordinary vertices to bg vertices , though to our knowledge a general systematic study for multiloop is not available .",
    "there are two reasons why cancellation of gauge - dependent terms and gauge transformations are considerably more complicated in qcd than in qed .",
    "the first is the complication of color .",
    "fortunately this can be sidestepped by a color decomposition and the use of color - oriented diagrams , as will be discussed in  iia .",
    "the second complication is more substantial , and it relates to the problem of source diffusion . unlike qed where the charge always resides on the electron lines , the presence of triple and four - gluon vertices spread the color globally throughout the feynman diagram . in other words ,",
    "it is the covariant divergence of the color current that is now zero , and not the usual divergence .",
    "this global nature means that the local cancellation of gauge - dependence in qed is no longer sufficient for qcd .",
    "this additional complication of source diffusion fortunately can be handled by introducing ` propagating diagrams ' , as will be discussed in  iib .",
    "one may also view the discussion below in another light .",
    "imagine starting out from a classical yang - mills theory or a tree - order scattering amplitude .",
    "ghost vertices are absent there .",
    "suppose now loop diagrams are built up via generalized unitarity by gluing together tree diagrams .",
    "ghost loops would still be absent after the gluing so why then do we need them ?",
    "the reason must be that without them the loop amplitudes will no longer be gauge invariant , but how do we see that ?",
    "part of what is being discussed below ( figs .",
    "1316 ) can be thought of as a way of seeing that .",
    "alternatively one may think of what is being done below as just another way of deriving the brst transformation , but this time microscopically , done vertex by vertex and diagram by diagram .",
    "the basic technique for separating the color and for the creating of the ` propagating diagrams ' will be discussed in the next section , throughout which the gluon propagator is taken to be in the feynman gauge .",
    "this technique is then used to prove _ diagrammatically _ known field - theoretic results . in particular covariant - gauges will be taken up in  iii , and _ multiloop _ pinching technique will be discussed in ",
    "iv , where we shall show how to create background gauge vertices from ordinary vertices by the _ incomplete cancellation _ of divergent parts . in  v , we shall discuss two examples for using these techniques to design new gauges .",
    "these are just examples and there is no claim that the new gauges are the simplest possible .",
    "nevertheless , it does illustrate that _ simpler _ gauges can be designed , and hopefully by working harder one can one day design the ` simplest ' gauge to be used for a given set of diagrams .",
    "this latter problem is being studied .",
    "if a qcd feynman amplitude @xmath2 is given a color decomposition into a set of independent color tensors @xmath3 , @xmath4 , then each of the color - independent subamplitudes @xmath5 is known to be gauge invariant [ 1 ] , though how this is achieved diagrammatically , so that individual gauge - dependent diagrams add up to give gauge - independent results , is much less known . in order to study this we must first learn how to compute the subamplitudes @xmath5 diagrammatically .",
    "the relevant diagrams to compute @xmath5 from are the _ color - oriented diagrams_. they differ from the ordinary feynman diagrams in having fixed _ cyclic ordering _ of the gluon and the ghost lines at all the vertices . vertices with such ordering imposed are the _ color - oriented vertices _ ; feynman diagrams made up of color - oriented vertices are the color - oriented diagrams@xcite .",
    "a single feynman diagram gives rise to many color - oriented diagrams , differing from one another in the cyclic ordering of the gluon and ghost lines at the vertices .",
    "color - oriented vertices arise from ordinary triple - gluon and ghost vertices by a decomposition of their color factor , @xmath6.$ ] this produces two trace terms with fixed cyclic ordering of the fundamental color generators @xmath7 , corresponding to the two color - oriented vertices .",
    "similarly , the decomposition of the color factor @xmath8 $ ] generates color - oriented vertices for an ordinary four - gluon vertex .",
    "the color factor at a fermion vertex is given by @xmath7 .",
    "it can not be further decomposed so there is only one color - oriented vertex per ordinary fermion vertex . in that case",
    "it does not matter where the gluon line is drawn wrt the quark line .    in an @xmath9 theory ,",
    "each color - oriented diagram gives rise to only one color tensor @xmath3 , determined entirely by the cyclic ordering of the external lines .",
    "thus each @xmath5 is given by the sum of color - oriented diagrams with a fixed external - line ordering .",
    "for @xmath10 theories , a color - oriented diagram may contain more than one color tensor @xmath3 , but in what follows we shall only consider those @xmath5 given by the sum of all color - oriented diagrams with a fixed ordering of the external lines .",

    "2 . what makes qcd complicated is the presence of many more vertices and divergence relations , and the existence of these propagating diagrams relating to the source diffusion problem discussed in the introduction .    possibly with the exception of fig .  4",
    ", these divergence relations have a regular structure which we shall call the _ canonical structure_. on the rhs of these divergence relations there are always two sliding diagrams with opposite signs , arranged so that the signs obtained from a triple - gluon vertex are opposite to the signs obtained from a four - gluon vertex .",

    "there exists another diagram where the gluon loop is replaced by the ghost loop , in which the ordinary ghost vertex 20b appears .",
    "the combination of 20a and 20b now gives rise to the bg ghost vertex 20c .",
    "an extra minus sign from the ghost loop has been incorporated in front of 20a to make the combined sign @xmath21 as shown . however , analytically 20a contributes a minus sign because of the wrong orientation of the funny vertex .",
    "the only other way the cross in 19b can return is through a sliding diagram 3b at the last step , thus producing 21a or 22a . since the propagating cross always drags a ghost line behind it , the gluon loop through which the cross returns has now been changed into a ghost loop and an examination of eqs .",
    "( 4.5 ) and ( 4.6 ) shows that 21a is the same as 21b=18e and 22a is the same as 22b=18e and 22c=18f .",
    "we have therefore completed showing lemma 3 when @xmath40 , because none of the other bg vertices in 18 are present for @xmath40 .",
    "we will now proceed to @xmath41 and assume the first vertex to have been converted already into bg vertices .",
    "we must now examine the effect of converting the second vertex from ordinary to bg vertices , again using the relations in 19 .",
    "clearly as in the case @xmath40 , there is no problem is converting the second vertex into bg vertices if it were alone .",
    "but with @xmath41 , there is now the possibility of an interaction between the two vertices to cause a change .    to start with",
    ", we can no longer use fig .  3 to propagate the cross beyond the first vertex because the triple - gluon vertex here is already a bg vertex .",
    "we must therefore work out a relation analogous to 3 but valid for the bg triple - gluon vertex .",
    "this is obtained from eq .",
    "( 4.1 ) and shown in 26 , with 26f being @xmath42 .",
    "it is important to note that this divergence still possesses a regular structure .",
    "as before , we have the sliding diagrams with opposite signs ( 26b and 26c ) , the propagating diagrams with plus signs ( 26d and 26e ) , but there is now a new _ stagnant diagram _ involving the funny vertex ( 26f ) with a single ghost line that goes nowhere .",
    "the analytical expression for this term is @xmath43 , with a minus sign on account of the wrong orientation of the funny vertex .",
    "note also that the gluon line in 26d has an arrow but not the one in 26e , ` because ' that is how it is inherited from 26a .",
    "although this is getting ahead of ourselves , it would be useful for the sake of comparison to examine this _ modified canonical structure _ for other divergence relations obtained from eqs .",
    "( 4.1 ) to ( 4.7 ) , and shown in figs",
    ".  27 to 32 .",
    "there are unfortunately many divergence relations , but this can not be helped because there are many bg vertices , and because there are many external - line / cross combinations in taking the divergence of 1d . nevertheless , all these relations possess the sliding diagrams with the canonical signs , the propagating diagrams with plus signs , and the stagnant diagrams with minus signs .",
    "external lines are inherited , vertices that do not make sense will not appear , and in the case of the divergence of a four - gluon vertex , the cross is not allowed to propagate through an arrowed line .",
    "this last rule is ` why ' there are no propagating ghosts from the top to the bottom gluon lines in 27 , for example . the reason ` why ' there is no propagating ghost from the top to the left line in fig .",
    "29 is because the resulting bg ghost vertex does not exist ( the arrowed line is not adjacent to the outgoing ghost ) .",

    "it is important to remark that in the definition of the bg vertices 18 to 25 , as well as in the divergence relations 26 to 32 , all the external lines may be taken off - shell .",
    "let us now return to the construction of the bg vertices for @xmath41 , and consider the effect of the cross 19b originating from the second vertex reaches the first ( bg ) vertex . because of the modified canonical structure of 26 , things proceed similarly to lemma 1 and 2 .",
    "various situations can happen when this cross returns to vertex 2 via a gluon loop . a sliding contribution just before it returns to the second vertex gives rise to 21 to 23 .",
    "if the first vertex is just to the right of the second vertex , then in using 19 to convert the second vertex , the contribution of 19c followed by 26 on the first vertex produces terms like 24b , 25b , and 25c . when combined with ordinary four - gluon vertex attached to these two external lines , the bg vertices 24c and 25d are produced .",
    "this completes the proof of lemma 3 for @xmath41 . for @xmath44 ,",
    "it is easy to see that nothing new can happen , in the sense that three or more vertices can interact only pairwise .",
    "this then completes the proof of the lemma for all @xmath1 .",
    "the technique developed in  ii was used in  iii to show the independence of the gauge used in gluon propagators , and in  iv to convert ordinary to bg vertices .",
    "there is no reason why it can not be used to study other gauge problems , including our eventual hope to find the ` best ' gauge for computing a specific set of gauge - invariant diagrams .    in the present section ,",
    "we will discuss two unconventional gauges , one for four - gluon tree amplitude and the other for two - loop gluon self - energy diagrams .",
    "the new gauges carry fewer terms than either the ordinary or the bg gauge .",
    "though they may not be the ` best ' gauge possible for the specific problems , nevertheless , it does illustrate the fact that improvements can be made on existing gauges using the techniques developed in this paper .    the tree - diagram example is given in fig .",
    "39 , where the arrowed vertices are given in 18 ( eq .",
    "( 4.1 ) and ( 4.4 ) ) .",
    "it can be shown using the techniques above that a new gauge containing the vertices in these diagrams does exist , _ viz .",
    ", _ the three diagrams in 39 do sum up to give the four - gluon on - shell scattering amplitude .",
    "note that this is _ not _ the bg gauge .",
    "since all the four lines in 39a are external , vertex 1d should be used in the background gauge instead of 39a . moreover , each of the two 3 g vertices in 39b , c contains two external lines , again 1b rather than 18a should have been used in the background gauge . in other words , there is no difference between the bg and the ordinary gauge in this process .",
    "39a contains one term but the corresponding vertex in bg contains 3 terms .",
    "each of 39b , c contains @xmath45 terms whereas the corresponding diagrams in bg each contains @xmath46 terms .",
    "thus the new gauge depicted in 39 saves a total of 42 terms out of the 75 terms needed in the bg .",
    "the two - loop example is given in fig .",
    "40 , where for easy drawing solid lines are used to denote gluons . 40a and 40b are the two - gluon - loop diagrams in bg , whereas 40c and 40d are the same diagrams in the new gauge . again",
    "the arrowed vertices are those displayed in 18 .",
    "the two - loop gluon self - energy contains a total of 18 diagrams in bg , but owing to incomplete cancellation of the divergence terms when we shift gauges , new vertices and new diagrams are generated and a total of 26 diagrams appeared in this new gauge .",
    "nevertheless , the new gauge still contains few terms in total , because the largest number of terms for each gauge already occurs in the diagrams shown .",
    "the bg contains a total of 1242 terms , of which 1152 are contained in 40a , b .",
    "in contrast , the new gauge contains a total of only 766 terms , of which 512 are contained in 40c and 40d . in other words ,",
    "62% more labour is required to compute the two - loop self energy in bg than in the new gauge , and clearly even more labour is required to compute it in the ordinary gauge .",
    "other details of this gauge and the two - loop computation will appear separately .",
