    "the most crowded extrasolar planetary system discovered so far is that around the main - sequence star 55 cnc(= @xmath0 cancri ) .",
    "doppler shift measurements strongly suggest the existence of five planets orbiting the star with semimajor axes ranging from 0.038 to 5.901 au @xcite .",
    "the innermost and smallest planet , @xmath1 , is a neptune - mass object while the outer and most massive one , planet @xmath2 , has a minimum mass of about 4 jupiter masses .",
    "a self - consistent dynamical fit to the stellar wobble data performed by @xcite gives a set of orbital elements for the planets reported in table 1 .",
    "it is claimed @xcite that this nominal system of five planets described in table 1 is dynamically stable at least over a timescale of 1 myr .",
    "we would like to point out that planets @xmath3 and @xmath4 are no longer in a 3:1 mean motion resonance as in the previous solution given by @xcite .",
    "in addition , the eccentricity of planet @xmath4 in @xcite is significantly smaller compared to that derived by @xcite .",
    "we have performed a detailed exploration of the stability of the nominal system by applying the frequency map analysis ( hereinafter fma ) method @xcite on 400 varied systems .",
    "these systems are obtained by varying orbital elements of the nominal system .",
    "the varied systems are analysed by adding randomly some inclination ( lower than 5 deg ) to the keplerian orbits to make the system more realistic .",
    "the masses of the planets are scaled accordingly . among all the systems analysed with fma we obtain cases with large diffusion speed in the phase space suggesting a chaotic evolution and possible instability . however , integrating a few of these chaotic systems over timescales of @xmath5 yrs , we never obtain destabilization . we , therefore , think that these chaotic system are examples for stable chaos .",
    "this term was introduced by @xcite to indicate the peculiar behaviour of asteroids with short lyapunov times ( of the order of some @xmath6 yrs ) which however show a remarkable stability over the age of the solar system @xcite .",
    "for the 55cnc planetary system we find that in about 15% of all cases the orbital elements of the four inner planets exhibit a chaotic evolution on a timescale of a few million of years .",
    "this stable chaos may be due to the topology of the phase space : quasi  periodic solutions in the proximity of a chaotic island can act like `` quasi",
    " barriers '' for the diffusion @xcite .",
    "the chaotic evolution appears to be confined and the system does not destabilize at least on a timescale of 400 myr",
    ". this peculiar behaviour may be due to the closeness of the system to the planetary 3:1 mean motion resonance between planets @xmath3 and @xmath4 and secular resonances .    to confirm that stable chaos",
    "is not limited to the nominal case but can be retrieved also in a larger region of the phase space , we randomly varied the orbital elements of the nominal case and found a similar behaviour .",
    "for a few selected cases , we also applied the megno method ( the acronym of mean exponential growth factor of nearby orbits ) proposed by cincotta & sim ( 2000 ) .",
    "the results obtained by megno confirm the fma results .    [",

    "we have performed the fma analysis on 400 different systems derived from table 1 .",
    "random mean anomalies , node longitudes and inclinations lower than @xmath7 are assigned to each planet .",
    "all other orbital elements were taken from table 1 .",
    "the frequency analysis is performed over a timescale of @xmath8 yrs .",
    "the orbital elements computed with the numerical integrator symba @xcite are fourier analyzed and the values of intrinsic frequencies are obtained over running windows .",
    "the relative changes of these frequencies are estimated and used to compute the diffusion rate in the phase space .",
    "we have applied fma to the signal @xmath9 , the difference between the periapse longitude of planets @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and to the more conventional signal @xmath10 .",
    "the usual non  singular variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 refer to the innermost planet @xmath1 where ecc refers to its eccentricity .",
    "the diffusion rate is computed by using the standard deviation @xmath13 of the main frequency of the signal computed over the running windows .",
    "slow diffusion rates , characterized by small values of @xmath13 , mean quasi  periodic systems , while large values of @xmath13 imply chaotic evolution .",
    "as in @xcite we measure the diffusion speed by the logarithmic number @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the smallest value of @xmath13 we observed in our sample of systems .",
    "a small value of @xmath16 means a low dispersion of the frequencies in the considered time interval and , hence , a slow diffusion speed in the phase space .",
    "large values of @xmath16 indicate fast changes of the system frequencies and , therefore , chaos .    in fig.[histo ]",
    "we show the distribution of the diffusion speed measured by @xmath16 in our sample of 400 55cnc planetary systems .",
    "values smaller than 4 suggestlong term stability according to our previous experience with fma , while larger values indicate chaos .",
    "we concentrate on systems with a diffusion speed of about 5 or larger which represent about 15% of the whole sample we analysed .",
    "these systems have major frequencies which change on short timescales .",
    "if the fast diffusion of major frequencies induces also drastic changes of amplitudes , in particular of planetary eccentricities , close encounters between planets may occur resulting in the ejection of one or more planets .",
    "we will show in the next section that planetary eccentricities do not increase on longer timescales which suggets a `` stable chaos '' state for the cnc55 system .",
    "an additional set of fma simulations has been performed for 400 systems where we have randomly varied the last signifcant digit of all the orbital elements given in table 1 .",
    "we obtain a histogram that is very similar to that shown in fig.[histo ] confirming that the behaviour of stable chaos we have found for the nominal case of table 1 is extended in phase space .",
    "for those systems with a large diffusion speed ( @xmath17 ) we performed numerical integrations over a timescale of 400 myr with symba @xcite . in fig.[long_ecc",
    "] we show for a typical run the evolution of the eccentricity of the 3 inner planets @xmath18 .",
    "the eccentricity jumps reveal the chaotic nature of the system .",
    "the jumps are obviously correlated among the three planets .",
    "major jumps occur simultaneously .",
    "also the eccentricity of planet @xmath19 shows simultaneously jumps but more moderate .",
    "all jumps , although they appear to be significant , do not result in close approaches among the planets .",
    "the planetary system is not destabilized on this timescale while it is chaotic .",
    "-1.2 truecm     fig.[long_ecc ] suggests that we have the case of stable chaos .",
    "the eccentricity evolution is characterized by jumps . it does not have a random walk growth but remains limited .",
    "it appears that the system is bouncing between limited regions .",
    "a different case with similar high diffusion speed @xmath16 is shown in fig.[sma ] .",
    "the semimajor axes of the three inner planets are shown on a shorter timescale to highlight the chaotic evolution .",
    "also in this case the system remains confined in a stable configuration over 400 myr .",
    "besides the fma method which uses the diffusion rate of intrinsic frequencies to measure chaos , there is a large class of methods which use the divergence of nearby orbits in phase space as a measure .",
    "exponential divergence means chaos while linear divergence means non - chaotic which guarantees stability of the dynamical system .",
    "stability means here that , in particular , no planet is ejected out of the system .",
    "a nearly exponential divergence does not necessarily mean instability in our sense over the lifetime of the system . as outlined above",
    ", we would qualify such a system as stable chaotic .",
    "the widely used lyapunov characteristic numbers ( lcns ) yield the necessary information about the divergence and are used to measure the chaocity of the system .",
    "since the computation of the lcns is very time consuming , more rapid methods were introduced which were shown to yield a very good estimation for the lcns .",
    "one of these fast lcn estimators is the megno @xcite method .",
    "it was applied to several exoplanetary systems @xcite .",
    "we computed the megno indicator for about 50 varied systems .",
    "they were obtained by varying only the eccentricites of planets e , b , c and f while taking the other orbital elements from the nominal system of table 1 .",
    "eccentricites of planet @xmath1 are varied between 0.22 and 0.26 , of planets @xmath3 and @xmath4 between 0 .",
    "and 0.10 and of planet @xmath19 between 0 .",
    "we integrated the systems over 100 000 yrs . for eccentricities of planets @xmath3 and @xmath4 ranging from 0 .",
    "to 0.02 , we obtain weak chaos .",
    "the estimator for the maximal lyapunov exponent is not linear but far from exponential . for larger eccentricities ,",
    "the indicator has a behaviour between linear and exponential .",
    "megno shows , like fma , that the four planetary orbits close to the nominal system are chaotic .",
    "among the possible dynamical configurations of the 55cnc planetary system there is also stable chaos .",
    "about 15% of the systems built from the nominal dynamical fit given in @xcite have a high diffusion speed in the phase space",
    ". however , the chaotic island seems to be limited in extent and surrounded by quasi  periodic systems . in this way , the chaotic systems do not increase their eccentricity to planet crossing values and they are stable over a long timescale . systems with intermediate values of diffusion speed @xmath16 as measured by fma ( @xmath20 ) do not show this behaviour .",
    "they possibly populate the outer border of the chaotic region and their chaotic evolution is much slower .",
    "systems with smaller values of @xmath16 are possibly stable over timescale of @xmath21 yrs .",
    "additional fma and megno computations show that this behaviour is not only peculiar for the nominal system given by table 1 but it is extended over a wider range of orbital elements for the system .",
    "the weak resonances responsible for the stable chaos are present also for different combinations of the initial orbital elements .",
    "we thank j. hadjidemetriou for his useful comments and suggestions that helped to improve the manuscript .",
