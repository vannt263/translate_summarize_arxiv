    "the theory of strong interaction has the strong coupling constant and the quark masses as fundamental input parameters .",
    "the latter constitute an essential input for the evaluation of weak decay rates of heavy mesons and for quarkonium spectroscopy . furthermore , decay rates and branching ratios of a light higgs boson  as suggested by electroweak precision measurements  depend critically on the masses of the charm and bottom quarks .",
    "last not least , confronting the predictions for these masses with experiment is an important task for all variants of grand unified theories . to deduce the values in a consistent way from different experimental investigations and with utmost precision is thus a must for current phenomenology .",
    "the method described in this contribution goes back to 1977  @xcite and was applied to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in ref .",
    "the nnnlo analysis , including updated experimental input , was presented in ref .",
    "the basic object which enters our analysis is the photon polarization function defined through @xmath3 with @xmath4 being the electromagnetic current . the normalized total cross section for hadron production in @xmath5 annihilation",
    "is then given by @xmath6    \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 . in the following we add a subscript @xmath8 to indicate the contribution from the heavy quark @xmath8 .",
    "the idea for extracting a quark mass value @xmath9 is based on moments constructed from @xmath10 . on one hand",
    "one can compute the taylor expansion of @xmath11 around @xmath12 and obtain the so - called `` theory - moments '' from @xmath13 the three - loop contribution to @xmath11 up to @xmath14 within qcd has been computed in refs .",
    "@xcite and the four - loop calculation for @xmath15 and @xmath16 has been performed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite also two - loop qed corrections and non - perturbative contributions have been considered .",
    "the latter shows a visible effect only in the case of the charm quark .    from dimensional considerations we have @xmath17 which implies a stronger dependence of @xmath9 on variations of @xmath18 for smaller values of @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , higher values of @xmath19 require a careful theoretical treatment of the threshold region and the construction of an effective theory .",
    "the analysis performed in ref .",
    "@xcite is restricted to @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "note that precise mass values can only be obtained for the three lowest moments since the non - perturbative contributions become too big already for @xmath22 .",
    "one of the major advantages of the method discussed in this paper is that we can adopt the @xmath0 scheme for the quark mass entering eq .",
    "( [ eq::mom - theory ] ) and thus directly extract the corresponding value for the mass .    in order to extract experimental moments",
    "one exploits the analyticity of @xmath10 and arrives at @xmath23 where @xmath24 naturally divides into three parts : at lower energies one has the narrow resonances which are the @xmath25 and @xmath26 for charm the @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) in the case of the bottom quark .",
    "the corresponding contributions to @xmath18 are obtained with the help of the narrow width approximation for @xmath29 @xmath30 where the electronic widths @xmath31 are known at the 1 - 2% level .",
    "the second part is called threshold region and extends in the case of the charm quark from 3.73  gev to about 5  gev . in this region",
    "the cross section shows a rapid variation and can not be described by perturbation theory .",
    "measurements from the bes collaboration from 2001  @xcite and 2006  @xcite provide excellent data for @xmath29 with an uncertainty of about @xmath32 . in order to obtain @xmath33",
    "one has to subtract the contribution from the light quarks which is explained in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the treatment of the bottom threshold region is quite similar .",
    "measurements of @xmath34 from threshold up to 11.24  gev have been performed by the cleo collaboration more than 20 years ago  @xcite , with a systematic error of 6% .",
    "no radiative corrections were applied .",
    "the average value derived from the four data points below threshold amounts to @xmath35 which is 28% larger than the prediction from perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "however , a later result of cleo  @xcite at practically the same energy , @xmath36 , is significantly more precise and in perfect agreement with theory . applying a rescaling factor of @xmath37 to the old cleo data not only enforces agreement between old and new cleo data and pqcd in the region below the @xmath38 , it leads , in addition , also to excellent agreement between theory and experiment above threshold around 11.2  gev where pqcd should be applicable also to bottom production",
    ". further support to our approach is provided by the cleo measurement of the cross section for bottom quark production at @xmath39  gev which is given by @xmath40  nb  @xcite .",
    "the central value can be converted to @xmath41 . on the other hand ,",
    "if one extracts @xmath42 from the rescaled cleo data from 1984  @xcite one obtains @xmath43 which deviates by less than 4% from the recent result  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig::cleodata ] the original and the rescaled data from  @xcite is shown and compared to pqcd and data point from  @xcite .",
    "we thus extract the threshold contribution to the moments from the interval 10.62  gev @xmath44 11.24  gev by applying the rescaling factor to the data , subtract the `` background '' from @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 quarks and attribute a systematic error of 10% to the result .",
