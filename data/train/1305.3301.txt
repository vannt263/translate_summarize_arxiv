    "cuprate superconductors are susceptible to spin and charge density ordered phases that compete with superconductivity .",
    "this is well established in la - based cuprates,@xcite where ( quasi ) static spin / charge stripes are widely observed , even in coexistence with superconductivity@xcite .",
    "however , their presence in other cuprate families is generally unconfirmed . because density waves are one of the proposed origins for the pseudogap in the underdoped regime , it is necessary to establish whether charge and spin order are universal amongst the cuprates .",
    "the recent discovery of charge order ( without spin order ) in underdoped @xmath1 ( ybco ) is an important step in this direction . in this work ,",
    "we describe novel incommensurate charge - ordered phases that arise in the three - band emery model for cuprates , and discuss the extent to which these are consistent with the charge order detected in ybco .    early evidence for broken symmetry phases in ybco came from magneto - oscillation experiments , which identified a reconstructed fermi surface@xcite with an electron - like fermi surface pocket@xcite that emerges when strong magnetic fields are applied .",
    "these experiments were theoretically discussed from the perspective of density waves.@xcite nernst effect measurements found a uniaxial symmetry breaking,@xcite consistent with a charge - density wave ( cdw ) .",
    "subsequent nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments further suggested a commensurate cdw with a period of four unit cells , with no evidence for any spin ordering@xcite . in this work ,",
    "the authors made a clear distinction between ortho - ii ybco ( with hole doping @xmath20.12 ) where _ only _ charge order is seen , and lower dopings near the superconductor - insulator transition where charge and spin order are both seen.@xcite    more recently , x - ray scattering@xcite experiments have identified a cdw phase in the same doping and magnetic field range in which fermi surface pockets are detected .",
    "the charge pattern is aligned with the crystalline axes@xcite and is incommensurate , with a weakly doping dependent period of @xmath3 lattice constants .",
    "whether this cdw is uniaxial@xcite or biaxial@xcite has not been resolved , and may depend on doping.@xcite regardless of the details , x - ray and nmr experiments established that the incommensurate cdw competes with the superconductivity,@xcite implying that both phases operate on similar energy scales .",
    "the x - ray results suggest that this charge - ordered state is distinct from the stripe phase in la - based cuprates;@xcite however , its relation to apparent charge - ordered phases in bi - based cuprates is still not clear .",
    "photoemission experiments on underdoped bi - cuprates have found spectral features@xcite that are consistent with competing non - superconducting phases .",
    "scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments@xcite further pointed to intra - unit cell charge order .",
    "the simplest candidates for such order are uniaxial `` nematic '' , or biaxial `` checkerboard '' phases involving a spontaneous transfer of charge between oxygen @xmath4 and @xmath5 orbitals within the cuo@xmath6 unit cell .    in the present work",

    "we find that , through much of the phase diagram , the leading instability is to an incommensurate ( finite-@xmath13 ) charge modulation involving primarily the oxygen orbitals .",
    "when the ordering wavevector @xmath14 tends to zero , this phase evolves continuously into the commensurate nematic phase proposed by fischer and kim@xcite to explain the stm results for bi - cuprates .",
    "the possibility of finite-@xmath13 `` modulated nematic order '' ( mno ) was raised previously in one - band models.@xcite in this context , `` nematic '' refers to an anisotropic renormalization of the bond - centered kinetic energy that disrupts the tetragonal symmetry of the lattice .",
    "this anisotropy can be viewed as the result of integrating out inequivalent oxygen orbitals in a three - band model,@xcite and in this light the one - band bond - centered nematicity may be related to the nematic phase reported here , which is characterized by a spontaneous transfer of charge between o@xmath4 and o@xmath5 orbitals . note that we make a distinction between mno , for which the charge transfer is predominantly intra - unit cell , and conventional cdw order , for which the charge transfer is inter - unit cell .    despite the differences between one- and three - band models ,",
    "there are some surprising similarities in the structure of the modulations . within the `` hotspot '' model@xcite",
    "the modulation wavevector @xmath15 lies along the brillouin zone diagonal .",
    "holder and metzner@xcite considered a more general interaction and found that @xmath15 may be either diagonal or axial ( bond - aligned ) , depending on the fermi - surface shape . here , we find that the doping dependence of @xmath15 is qualitatively the same as that found by holder and metzner , even though the mechanism which drives the instability is different .    earlier ,",
    "a different charge instability , involving charge transfer between cu and o was found in the three - band emery model when the energies of o@xmath4 , o@xmath5 , and cu@xmath7 orbitals are close to degenerate.@xcite this charge transfer instability does not occur for the more realistic range of parameters studied below . in the strong - coupling limit of the emery model it was instead",
    "argued that the interaction @xmath16 between neighboring oxygen sites confines the motion of doped holes to one - dimensional channels which thereby suggests a possible source for nematicity@xcite .",

    "the magnitude of @xmath119 in our calculations is set by the fermi surface structure , and it is entirely possible that the discrepancy may be reconciled by tailoring the model specifically to ortho - ii ybco .",

    "the trend for hole - like fermi surfaces to have a diagonal modulation vector is a remarkably robust feature of our calculation .    finally , we return to the discussion of the fermi surface in the modulated nematic phase . as we noted in sec .  [",

    "this is particularly interesting because magneto - oscillation experiments,@xcite along with hall measurements,@xcite on ybco have demonstrated the existence of small electron - like fermi surface pockets occupying @xmath245 of the brillouin zone area .",
    "we make a few observations about a possible correspondence between the experiments and our calculations .",
    "first , while electron pockets should be observable in arpes experiments , such experiments are difficult to perform on ybco .",
    "second , a large number of arpes experiments has been done on bi - based cuprates , and these have not seen electron pockets . however , bi - cuprates are highly inhomogeneous and this can mask spectral signatures of non - superconducting phases.@xcite furthermore , magneto - oscillation experiments are hampered in the bi - cuprates by high levels of disorder , and have not provided independent confirmation of the fermi surface structure .",
    "it is thus possible that charge modulations are accompanied by well - defined antinodal electron pockets in ybco but not in bi - cuprates .",

    "however , in the relevant doping range , the orientation of the modulation wavevector is rotated with respect to that measured in x - ray scattering experiments . at this point , it is not clear whether this discrepancy is the result of an oversimplification of the cuprate band structure by the three - band model , or whether it is the result of still unresolved physics that is missing from the model .",
