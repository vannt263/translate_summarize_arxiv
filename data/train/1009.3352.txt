    "the quantum boltzmann equation ( qbe ) , also known as the uehling - uhlenbeck equation , describes the behaviors of a dilute quantum gas .",
    "it was first formulated by nordheim @xcite and uehling and uhlenbeck @xcite from the classical boltzmann equation by heuristic arguments . here",
    "we mainly consider two kinds of quantum gases : the bose gas and the fermi gas .",
    "the bose gas is composed of bosons , which have an integer value of spin , and obey the bose - einstein statistics .",
    "the fermi gas is composed of fermions , which have half - integer spins and obey the fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "let @xmath0 be the phase space distribution function depending on time @xmath1 , position @xmath2 and particle velocity @xmath3 , then the quantum boltzmann equation reads : @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the knudsen number which measures the degree of rarefaction of a gas .",
    "it is the ratio between the mean free path and the typical length scale .",
    "the quantum collision operator @xmath6 is @xmath7d\\omega dv_*\\ ] ] where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the rescaled planck constant . in this paper",
    ", the upper sign will always correspond to the bose gas while the lower sign to the fermi gas . for the fermi gas",
    ", we also need @xmath10 by the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the shorthand notations for @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the velocities before and after collision .",
    "they are related by the following parametrization : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the unit vector along @xmath23 .",
    "the collision kernel @xmath24 is a nonnegative function that only depends on @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the angle between @xmath22 and @xmath28 ) . in the variable hard sphere ( vhs ) model , it is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a positive constant .",
    "@xmath31 corresponds to the maxwellian molecules , @xmath32 is the hard sphere model .    when the knudsen number @xmath5 is small , the right hand side of equation ( [ qbe ] ) becomes stiff and explicit schemes are subject to severe stability constraints .",
    "implicit schemes allow larger time step , but new difficulty arises in seeking the numerical solution of a fully nonlinear problem at each time step .",
    "ideally , one wants an implicit scheme allowing large time steps and can be inverted easily . in @xcite , for the classical boltzmann equation , filbet and jin proposed to penalize the nonlinear collision operator @xmath33 by a bgk operator : @xmath34+\\lambda[\\mathcal{m}_c - f]\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is a constant that depends on the spectral radius of the linearized collision operator of @xmath33 around the local ( classical ) maxwellian @xmath36 .",
    "now the term in the first bracket of the right hand side of ( [ pen ] ) is less stiff than the second one and can be treated explicitly .",
    "the term in the second bracket will be discretized implicitly . using the conservation property of the bgk operator",
    ", this implicit term can actually be solved explicitly .",
    "thus they arrive at a scheme which is uniformly stable in @xmath5 , with an implicit source term that can be inverted explicitly .",
    "furthermore , under certain conditions , one could show that this type of schemes has the following property : the distance between @xmath11 and the maxwellian will be @xmath37 after several time steps , no matter what the initial condition is .",
    "this guarantees the capturing of the fluid dynamic limit even if the time step is larger than the mean free time .    back to the quantum boltzmann equation ( [ qbe ] ) , a natural way to generalize the above idea is to penalize @xmath6 with the quantum bgk operator @xmath38 .",
    "this means we have to invert a nonlinear algebraic system that contains the unknown quantum maxwellian @xmath39 ( bose - einstein or fermi - dirac distribution ) for every time step . as mentioned in @xcite , this is not a trivial task compared to the classical case .",
    "specifically , one has to invert a nonlinear 2 by 2 system ( can be reduced to one nonlinear equation ) to obtain the macroscopic quantities , temperature and fugacity . due to the complexity of the quantum distribution functions ( bose - einstein or fermi - dirac function )",
    ", it is really a delicate issue to set a good initial guess for an iterative method such as the newton method to converge .    in this work",
    "we propose a new scheme for the quantum boltzmann equation .",
    "our idea is based on the observation that the classical maxwellian , with the temperature replaced by the ( quantum ) internal energy , has the same first five moments as the quantum maxwellian .",
    "this observation was used in @xcite to derive a ` classical ' kinetic scheme for the quantum hydrodynamical equations .",
    "therefore , we just penalize the quantum collision operator @xmath6 by a ` classical ' bgk operator , thus avoid the aforementioned difficulty .",
    "at the same time , we have to sacrifice a little bit on the asymptotic property .",
    "later we will prove that for the quantum bgk equation , the so obtained @xmath11 satisfies : @xmath40 i.e. @xmath11 will converge to the quantum maxwellian beyond the initial layer with an error of @xmath41 .",
    "another numerical issue is how to evaluate the quantum collision operator @xmath6 .",
    "in fact ( [ qq ] ) can be simplified as @xmath42d\\omega dv_*\\ ] ] so @xmath6 is indeed a cubic operator .",
    "almost all the existing fast algorithms are designed for the classical boltzmann operator based on its quadratic structure . here",
    "we will give a spectral method for the approximation of @xmath6 .",
    "as far as we know , this is the first time to compute the full quantum boltzmann collision operator with the spectral accuracy .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we give a brief introduction to the quantum boltzmann equation : the basic properties , the quantum maxwellians and the hydrodynamic limits . in section 3 ,",
    "we present the details of computing the quantum collision operator by the spectral method as well as the numerical accuracy .",
    "our new scheme to capture the hydrodynamic regime is given in section 4 .",
    "in section 5 , the proposed schemes are tested on the 1-d shock tube problem of the quantum gas for different knudsen number @xmath5 ranging from fluid regime to kinetic regime .",
    "the behaviors of the bose gas and the fermi gas in both the classical regime and quantum regime are included .",
    "finally some concluding remarks are given in section 6 .",
    "in this section we review some basic facts about the quantum boltzmann equation ( [ qbe ] ) .    * at the formal level , @xmath6 conserves mass , momentum and energy . @xmath43 * if @xmath11 is a solution of qbe ( [ qbe ] ) , the following local conservation laws hold : @xmath44 define the macroscopic quantities : density @xmath45 , macroscopic velocity @xmath46 , specific internal energy @xmath47 as @xmath48 and stress tensor @xmath49 and heat flux @xmath50 @xmath51 the above system can then be recast as @xmath52 * @xmath6 satisfies boltzmann s h - theorem , @xmath53 moreover , @xmath54 + where @xmath39 is the quantum maxwellian given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the fugacity , @xmath57 is the temperature ( see @xcite for more details about the derivation of @xmath39 ) .",
    "this is the well - known bose - einstein ( ` - ' ) and fermi - dirac ( ` + ' ) distributions .      substituting @xmath39 into ( [ den ] ) ( [ stress ] ) , the system ( [ euler ] ) can be closed , yielding the quantum euler equations : @xmath58 with the macroscopic variables @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , they are exactly the same as the classical euler equations . however , the intrinsic constitutive relation is quite different . @xmath45 and",
    "@xmath47 are connected with @xmath57 and @xmath56 ( used in the definition of @xmath39 ( [ max ] ) ) by a nonlinear 2 by 2 system : @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the bose - einstein function @xmath61 and the fermi - dirac function @xmath62 respectively , @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the gamma function .    the physical range of interest for a bose gas is @xmath65 , where @xmath66 corresponds to the degenerate case ( the onset of bose - einstein condensation ) . for the fermi gas we do nt have such a restriction and the degenerate case is reached when @xmath56 is very large . for small @xmath56 ( @xmath67 ) , the integrand in ( [ bose ] ) and ( [ fermi ] ) can be expanded in powers of @xmath56 , @xmath68 thus , for @xmath69 , both functions behave like @xmath56 itself and one recovers the classical limit .    on the other hand , the first equation of ( [ rhoue ] ) can be written as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is just the coefficient of the classical maxwellian , which should be an @xmath72 quantity . now if @xmath73 , then @xmath74 , which means @xmath75 by the monotonicity of the function @xmath76 .",

    "<S> this method , however , encounters its own difficulty when applied to the quantum boltzmann equation . to define the quantum maxwellian ( bose - einstein or fermi - dirac distribution ) at each time step and every mesh point , one has to invert a nonlinear equation that connects the macroscopic quantity fugacity with density and internal energy . setting a good initial guess for the iterative method </S>",
    "<S> is troublesome in most cases because of the complexity of the quantum functions ( bose - einstein or fermi - dirac function ) . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we propose to penalize the quantum collision term by a ` classical ' bgk operator instead of the quantum one . </S>",
    "<S> this is based on the observation that the classical maxwellian , with the temperature replaced by the internal energy , has the same first five moments as the quantum maxwellian . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme so designed avoids the aforementioned difficulty , and one can show that the density distribution is still driven toward the quantum equilibrium . </S>",
