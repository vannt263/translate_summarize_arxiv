    "quantum chromodynamics is widely accepted as the correct theory of the strong interactions and the quark propagator is its most basic quantity . in the low momentum region it exhibits dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( which can not be derived from perturbation theory ) and at high momentum it can be used to extract the running quark mass  @xcite . in lattice qcd , quark propagators are tied together to calculate hadron masses and other properties .",
    "lattice gauge theory provides a way to calculate the quark propagator directly , providing access to quantities such as operator product expansion ( ope ) condensates  @xcite . in turn",
    ", such a calculation can provide technical insight into lattice gauge theory simulations .",

    ", such alternative methods can provide feedback on regions that are difficult to access directly on the lattice , such as the deep infrared and chiral limits .",

    "see ref .",
    "all these actions have different systematic errors and the combination of these studies has given us an excellent handle on the possible lattice artifacts . in every case , however , they have been performed in the quenched approximation and have been restricted to modest physical volumes .    in this paper we report first results for the quark propagator including dynamical quark effects .",
    "we use configurations generated by the milc collaboration  @xcite available from the gauge connection  @xcite .",
    "these use `` asqtad '' , @xmath2 improved staggered quarks  @xcite , giving us access to relatively light sea quarks . in the quenched approximation , the quark propagator for this action has excellent rotational symmetry and is well behaved at large momenta  @xcite .",
    "we use quenched and dynamical configurations at the same lattice spacing and volume , which enables us to observe the relatively subtle effects of unquenching .",
    "these lattices are also somewhat larger than those of previous studies , giving us access to smaller momenta .",
    "the quark propagator is gauge dependent and we work in the landau gauge for ease of comparison with other studies .",

    "is observed to be proportional to the bare quark mass .",

    "is revealed as the chiral limit is approached , leading to the possibility of a larger infrared mass function for the lightest quark mass , despite the reduction of the input bare quark mass .",
    "in contrast , a hint of downward curvature is observed for the most infrared points of the full qcd mass function as the chiral limit is approached .",
    "it is interesting that the nature of the curvature depends significantly on the chiral dynamics of the theory which are modified in making the quenched approximation .",
    "similar behavior is observed in the hadron mass spectrum where the coefficients of chiral nonanalytic behavior can change sign in moving from quenched qcd to full qcd @xcite .",
    "we have presented first results for the mass and wave - function renormalization functions of the quark propagator in which the effects of @xmath41 dynamical quark flavours are taken into account .",
    "in contrast to the significant screening suppression of the gluon propagator in the infrared @xcite , the quark propagator is not strongly altered by sea quark effects .",
    "in particular , the renormalization function is insensitive to the light bare quark masses studied here , which range from 16 to 63 mev , and also agrees well with previous quenched simulation results .",
    "screening of dynamical mass generation in the infrared mass function is observed when comparing quenched and full qcd results at finite mass and in the chiral limit .",
    "the approach of the mass function to the chiral limit displays interesting nontrivial curvature for low momenta , with the curvature in quenched and full qcd in opposite directions .",
