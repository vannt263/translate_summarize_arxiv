    "it is known that lepton - hadron collisions have been playing a crucial role in exploration of deep inside of matter .",
    "for example , the quark - parton model was originated from investigation of electron - nucleon scattering .",
    "hera has opened a new era in this field extending the kinematics region by two orders both in high q@xmath7 and small @xmath8 compared to fixed target experiments .",
    "however , the region of sufficiently small @xmath8 and simultaneously high q@xmath7 ( @xmath910 gev@xmath7 ) , where saturation of parton densities should manifest itself , is currently not achievable .",
    "it seems possible that ea option of hera will give opportunity to observe such phenomena .",
    "then , the acceleration of polarized protons in hera could provide clear information on nucleon spin origin .",
    "the investigation of physics phenomena at extreme small @xmath8 but sufficiently high q@xmath7 is very important for understanding the nature of strong interactions at all levels from nucleus to partons . at the same time , the results from lepton - hadron colliders are necessary for adequate interpretation of physics at future hadron colliders . today , linac - ring type machines seem to be the main way to tev scale in lepton - hadron collisions ; however , it is possible that in future @xmath10 machines can be added depending on solutions of principal issues of basic @xmath11 colliders .",
    "construction of future lepton linacs tangentially to hadron rings ( hera , tevatron or lhc ) will provide a number of additional opportunities to investigate lepton - hadron and photon - hadron interactions at tev scale ( see [ 1 - 3 ] and references therein ) . for example :    tesla@xmath2hera = tesla@xmath12hera    @xmath12tev scale @xmath13 collider    @xmath12tev scale @xmath14 collider    @xmath15 collider     @xmath16 collider     @xmath12fel @xmath17a collider .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath14 and @xmath18 options are unique features of linac - ring type machines and can not be realized at lep@xmath4lhc , while it comparable with tesla@xmath2hera @xmath13 and @xmath19 options .",
    "there are a number of reasons [ 4,5 ] favoring a superconducting linear collider ( such as tesla ) as a source of e - beam for linac - ring type colliders .",
    "first of all , spacing between bunches in warm linacs , which is of the order of ns , does nt match with the bunch spacing in the hera , tevatron and lhc .",
    "also the pulse length is much shorter than the ring circumference . in the case of tesla , which use standing wave cavities",
    ", one can use both shoulders of linac in order to double electron beam energy , whereas in the case of conventional linear colliders one can use only half of the machine , because the travelling wave structures can accelerate only in one direction .",
    "the most transparent expression for the luminosity of linac - ring type @xmath13 colliders is [ 5 ] :    @xmath20 for round , transversely matched beams . the lower limit on @xmath21 , which is given by proton bunch length ,",
    "can be overcome by applying a  dynamic  focusing scheme [ 6 ] , where the proton bunch waist travels with electron bunch during collision . in this scheme @xmath21",
    "is limited , in principle , by the electron bunch length , which is two orders magnitude smaller .",
    "more conservatively , an upgrade of the luminosity by a factor 3 - 4 may be possible .",
    "earlier , the idea of using high energy photon beams , obtained by compton backscattering of laser light off a beam of high energy electrons , was considered for @xmath22 and @xmath23 colliders ( see [ 7 ] and references therein ) .",
    "then the same method was proposed for constructing @xmath24 colliders on the base of linac - ring type @xmath13 machines in [ 8 ] .",
    "rough estimations of the main parameters of @xmath14 collisions are given in [ 9 ] .",
    "the dependence of these parameters on the distance z between conversion region and collision point was analyzed in [ 10 ] , where some design problems were considered .",
    "the aim of this brief review is to draw the attention of the hep community to future @xmath25 and fel @xmath18 collider facilities .",
    "recently , the work on tesla tdr has been finished , and tesla@xmath2hera based @xmath28 and @xmath18 colliders are included [ 11 ] into tesla  project .",
    "main parameters of tesla@xmath2hera based on @xmath13 collider are given in table i. it is seen that one has @xmath29 @xmath30s@xmath31  with @xmath32 gev and @xmath33 tev . also two additional versions ( @xmath34 gev with @xmath35 @xmath30s@xmath31 and @xmath36 @xmath37 gev with @xmath38 @xmath30s@xmath31 ) have been mentioned .    in principle ,",
    "tesla@xmath2 hera based ep collider will extend the hera kinematics region by an order in both q@xmath7 and @xmath8 and , therefore , the parton saturation regime can be achieved .",
    "a brief account of some sm physics topics ( structure functions , hadronic final states , high q@xmath7 region etc.)which can be searched in tesla@xmath2hera @xmath13 collider is presented in [ 11 ] .",
    "the bsm search capacity of the machine will be defined by future results from lhc .",
    "if the first family leptoquarks and/or leptogluons have masses less than 1 tev , they will be produced copiously ( for couplings of the order of @xmath39 ) .",
    "the indirect manifestation of new gauge bosons may also be a matter of interest .",
    "in general , the physics search program of the machine is a direct extension of the hera search program .      referring to [ 10 ] for details",
    "let us note that @xmath41  at z=0 ( for @xmath17 options we use @xmath42m@xmath43 where @xmath44 is distance between conversion region and collision point . then , as one can see from fig .",
    "1 , luminosity slowly decreases with the increasing z ( factor @xmath451/2 at z=10 m ) and opposite helicity values for laser and electron beams are advantageous ( see fig .",
    "additionally , a better monochromatization of high - energy photons seen by proton bunch can be achieved by increasing the distance @xmath44 ( fig .",
    "the scheme with non - zero crossing angle and electron beam deflection considered in [ 10 ] for @xmath14 option lead to problems due to intensive synchrotron radiation of bending electrons and necessity to avoid the passing of electron beam from the proton beam focusing quadrupoles .",
    "alternatively , one can assume head - on - collisions ( see above ) and exclude deflection of electrons after conversion .",
    "in this case residual electron beam will collide with proton beam together with high - energy @xmath17 beam , but because of larger cross - section of @xmath14 interaction the background resulting from ep collisions may be neglected .",
    "the problem of over - focussing of the electron beam by the strong proton - low-@xmath46 quadrupoles is solved using the fact of smallness of the emittance of the tesla electron beam .",
    "for this reason the divergence of the electron beam after conversion will be dominated by the kinematics of the compton backscattering . in the case of 250 ( 800 )",
    "gev electron beam the maximum value of scattering angle is 4 ( 1.5 ) micro - radians .",
    "therefore , the electron beam transverse size will be 100 ( 37.5 ) @xmath47 at the distance of 25 m from conversion region and the focusing quadrupoles for proton beam have negligible influence on the residual electrons .",
    "on the other hand , in the scheme with deflection there is no restriction on n@xmath48 from @xmath49 , therefore , larger @xmath50 and bunch spacing may be preferable .",
    "all these topics need a further research .",
    "concerning the experimental aspects , very forward detector in @xmath17-beam direction will be very useful for investigation of small @xmath51 region due to registration of charmed and beauty hadrons produced via @xmath52 sub - process .",
    "there are a number of papers ( see [ 2 ] and refs . therein ) , devoted to physics at @xmath14 colliders .",
    "concerning the bsm physics , @xmath14 option of thera does not promise essential results with possible exclusions of the first family excited quarks ( if their masses are less than 1 tev ) and associate production of gaugino and first family squarks ( if the sum of their masses are less than 0.5 tev ) .",
    "the photo - production of w and z bosons may be also the matter of interest for investigation of the their anomalous couplings .",
    "however , @xmath53 and @xmath54  pairs will be copiously photo - produced at @xmath51 of order of 10@xmath55 and 10@xmath56 , respectively , and saturation of gluons should manifest itself .",
    "then , there are a number of different photo - production processes ( including di - jets etc . ) which can be investigated at @xmath14  colliders .",
    "the main limitation for this option comes from fast emittance growth due to intra - beam scattering . in this case",
    ", the use of flat nucleus beams seems to be more advantageous ( as in the case of ep option [ 12 ] ) because of luminosity lifetime increase of few times .",
    "nevertheless , sufficiently high luminosity can be achieved at least for light nuclei .",
    "for example , @xmath5710@xmath58 @xmath30s@xmath31 for collisions of 250 gev energy electrons beam ( table i ) and carbon beam with and  n@xmath59 ( rest of parameters as in table i ) .",
    "this value corresponds to @xmath60 pb@xmath61per working year ( @xmath62 ) , needed from the physics point of view [ 13,14 ] .",
    "as mentioned above , the large charge density of nucleus bunch results in strong intra - beam scattering effects and lead to essential reduction of luminosity lifetime ( @xmath63 1 h for c beam at hera ) .",
    "there are two possible solutions of this problem for tesla@xmath2hera .",
    "firstly , one could consider the possibility to re - fill nucleus ring at appropriate rate with necessary modifications of the filling time etc . alternatively ,",
    "an effective method of cooling of nucleus beam in main ring should be applied , especially for heavy nuclei .",
    "for example , electron cooling of nucleus beams suggested in [ 15 ] for @xmath19 option of hera can be used for tesla@xmath2hera , also .",
    "the physics search program of the machine is the direct extension of that for ea option of hera ( see chapter titled  light and heavy nuclei in hera  in [ 16 ] ) .      in our opinion",
    "this is the most promising option of tesla@xmath2hera complex , because it will give unique opportunity to investigate small @xmath51 region in nuclear medium .",
    "indeed , due to the advantage of the real @xmath17  spectrum , heavy quarks will be produced via @xmath65 fusion at characteristic    @xmath66 which is approximately @xmath67 for charmed hadrons .",
    "as in the previous option , sufficiently high luminosity can be achieved at least for light nuclei . the scheme with deflection of electron beam after conversion is preferable because it will give opportunity to avoid limitations from @xmath68 , especially for heavy nuclei .",
    "the dependence of luminosity on the distance between conversion region and interaction point for hera based @xmath69  collider is presented in figure 4 and @xmath70 @xmath30s@xmath31 at @xmath71 m. let us remind you that an upgrade of the luminosity by a factor 3 - 4 may be possible by applying a  dynamic  focusing scheme .",
    "further increase on luminosity will be possible with the cooling of nucleus beam in the main ring .",
    "finally , very forward detector in @xmath17-beam direction will be very useful for investigation of small @xmath51  region due to registration of charmed and beauty hadrons .",
    "let us finish this section by quoting the paragraph , written for ea option of the tesla@xmath2hera complex but more applicable for @xmath18option , from [ 13 ] :     extension of the @xmath8-range by two orders of magnitude at tesla - hera collider would correspond to an increase of the gluon densities by a factor of 3 for @xmath72 gev@xmath7 .",
    "it will definitely bring quark interactions at this scale into the region where dglap will break down .",
    "for the gluon - induced interactions it would allow the exploration of a non - dglap hard dynamics over two orders of magnitude in @xmath8 in the kinematics where @xmath73 is small while the fluctuations of parton densities are large .",
    "      colliding of tesla fel beam with nucleus bunches from hera may give a unique possibility to investigate ",
    "old  nuclear phenomena in rather unusual conditions .",
    "the main idea is very simple [ 2,17 ] : ultra - relativistic ions will see laser photons with energy @xmath74  as a beam of photons with energy 2@xmath75  , where @xmath76  is the lorentz factor of the ion beam",
    ". moreover , since the accelerated nuclei are fully ionized , we will be free from possible background induced by low - shell electrons .",
    "for hera @xmath77 , therefore , the region 0.1@xmath7810 mev , which is matter of interest for nuclear spectroscopy , corresponds to 0.1@xmath7810 kev lasers , which coincide with the energy region of tesla fel .",
    "the excited nucleus will return to the ground state at a distance @xmath79 from the collision point , where @xmath80 is the lifetime of the exited state in the nucleus rest frame and @xmath81 is the speed of light .",
    "for example , one has @xmath82  mm for 4438 kev excitation of @xmath83c .",
    "therefore , the detector should be placed close to the collision region .",
    "the mev energy photons emitted in the rest frame of the nucleus will be seen in the detector as high - energy photons with energies up to gev region",
    ".    the huge number of expected events ( @xmath4510@xmath84 per day for 4438 kev excitation of @xmath83c ) and small energy spread of colliding beams ( @xmath85 for both nucleus and fel beams ) will give opportunity to scan an interesting region with @xmath451 kev accuracy .",
    "the interest in this collider , which was widely discussed [ 18,19 ] at earlier stages of lhc proposal , has renewed recently [ 20 ] :     we consider the lhc @xmath86option to be already part of the lhc programme .",
    "the availability of @xmath87  collisions at an energy roughly four times that provided currently by hera would allow studies of quark structure down to a size of about 10@xmath88 cm ... the discovery of the quark substructure could explain the problem of flavour , or one might discover leptoquarks or squarks as resonances in the direct channel ...       the recent set of parameters is given in a report [ 21 ] prepared at the request of the cern scientific policy committee . with these parameters",
    "the estimated luminosity is @xmath89 @xmath30s@xmath31 and exceeds that of the hera@xmath2tesla based @xmath13  collider .",
    "however , the latter has the advantage in kinematics because of comparable values of energies of colliding particles .",
    "moreover , @xmath14  collider can not be constructed on the base of lep@xmath2lhc ( for reasons see [ 10 ] ) .",
    "an estimation of the luminosity for @xmath90 collisions given in [ 21 ] seems to be over - optimistic because of unacceptable value of @xmath91  , which is @xmath92 for proposed set of parameters .",
    "the one order lower value @xmath93 @xmath30s@xmath31 is more realistic .",
    "however , situation may be different for light nuclei .",
    "again the main advantage of the tesla@xmath2hera complex in comparison with lep@xmath4lhc is @xmath18  option .      if the main problems ( high @xmath3production rate , fast cooling of @xmath3beam etc . )",
    "facing @xmath11  proposals are successfully solved , it will also give an opportunity to construct @xmath10 colliders . today",
    "only very rough estimations of the parameters of these machines can be made .",
    "two sets of parameters for the collider with two rings , tevatron and 200 gev muon ring , are considered in [ 22 ] . in our opinion",
    ", luminosity values presented in [ 22 ] namely , @xmath94@xmath30s@xmath31 are over - optimitic . for comparison , recent set of 200 gev muon beam parameters [ 23 ] leads to estimation @xmath95 @xmath30s@xmath31 ( for details see review [ 3 ] ) .",
    "physics search program of this machine is similar to that of the ep option of the tesla@xmath2 hera complex .",
    "recently , an addition of 10 gev electron ring or linac to rhic  ring is discussed in order to investigate lepton - nucleus interactions [ 24 ] .",
    "luminosity of electron - gold collision for the first case is expected as @xmath96 @xmath30s@xmath31 with 360 ( 2520 ) bunches in each beam .",
    "for the second case expected luminosity is @xmath97 @xmath30s@xmath98 however , in order to achieve these relatively high values an electron cooling of nucleus beam is needed .",
    "beceuse of low value of the electron energy , @xmath17 options with compton backscattering photons are not sufficiently advantageous . on the other side ,",
    "fel @xmath18 options are the matter of interest if the tesla - like accelerator is chosen as an electron linac .",
    "parameters of the fel @xmath17-th collisions for e - linac@xmath2rhic are estimated in [ 25 ] .",
    "the center - of - mass energies which will be achieved at different options of this machine [ 26,27 ] are an order larger than those at hera are and @xmath453 times larger than the energy region of tesla@xmath2hera , lep@xmath2lhc and @xmath101tevatron . following [ 4,5 ] below we consider electron linac with @xmath102= 60 mw and upgraded proton beam from lhc ( table ii ) .      according to parameters given in table ii ,",
    "center - of - mass energy and luminosity for this option are @xmath103 tev and @xmath104 @xmath30s@xmath31 , respectively , and additional factor 3 - 4 can be provided by the  dynamic  focusing scheme [ 6 ] .",
    "further increasing will require cooling at injector stages .",
    "this machine , which will extend both the @xmath105-range and @xmath106-range by more than two order of magnitude comparing to those explored by hera , has a strong potential for both sm and bsm research .",
    "the advantage in spectrum of back - scattered photons ( for details see ref .",
    "[ 7 - 10 ] ) and sufficiently high luminosity ( @xmath107 @xmath30s@xmath108 ) will clearly manifest itself in a search for different phenomena .",
    "for example , thousands di - jets with @xmath109  gev and hundreds thousands single w bosons will be produced , hundred millions of  @xmath54- and  @xmath53- pairs will give opportunity to explore the region of extremely small x@xmath110 etc [ 2 ] .    in fig .",
    "5 , the dependence of luminosity on the distance @xmath44 between interaction point ( ip ) and conversion region ( cr ) is plotted ( for @xmath17 options we use @xmath111 m and @xmath112 m ) . in fig .",
    "6 , we plot luminosity distribution as a function of @xmath14 invariant mass @xmath113 at @xmath114 m. in fig . 7 ,",
    "this distribution is given for choice of @xmath115 and @xmath116 at three different values of the distance between ip and cr .",
    "in the case of lhc nucleus beam ibs effects in main ring are not crucial because of larger value of @xmath76  .",
    "the main principal limitation for heavy nuclei coming from beam - beam tune shift may be weakened using flat beams at collision point .",
    "rough estimations show that @xmath117 @xmath30s@xmath31 can be achieved at least for light and medium nuclei [ 26 ] .",
    "limitation on luminosity due to beam - beam tune shift is removed in the scheme with deflection of electron beam after conversion . in fig .",
    "8 , the dipendence of luminosity on @xmath44 is plotted for linac - lhc based @xmath118 collider , where we use @xmath119 for number of lead nuclei per bunch and the rest of parameters are as in table ii .",
    "the physics search potential of this option , as well as that of previous three options , needs more investigations from both particle and nuclear physics viewpoints .      due to a larger @xmath76",
    "the requirement on wavelength of the fel photons is weaker than in the case of tesla@xmath2hera based fel @xmath120 collider .",
    "therefore , the possibility of constructing a special fel for this option may be matter of interest . in any case",
    "the realization of fel @xmath121 colliders depends on the interest of  traditional  nuclear physics community .",
    "the potential of these machine for investigations of sm excitations is considered in [ 28 ] .",
    "the possible @xmath10 collider with @xmath122 tev in the framework of @xmath123 project was discussed in [ 29 ] and again over - estimated value of luminosity , namely , @xmath124 @xmath30s@xmath31 , was considered . using recent set of parameters [ 25 ] for high - energy muon collider with @xmath125 tev , one can easily estimate possible parameters of @xmath10 collisions from :    @xmath126 with @xmath127 we obtain @xmath128 @xmath30s@xmath31 ( for details , see [ 3 ] ) .",
    "this machine is comparable with the ep option of the linac@xmath2lhc .",
    "the clic [ 30 ] , an electron - positron collider with @xmath125 tev and @xmath129 @xmath30s@xmath130 is considered as one of the future options for post - lhc era at cern . if a @xmath131 gev proton ring is added at the beginning of positron shoulder of clic an opportunity to construct an @xmath132 collider with @xmath125 tev and @xmath14 collider with @xmath133 tev will appear . in order to coincide with clic parameters we need a proton ring with @xmath134 m circumference and repetition frequency   100 hz .",
    "the luminosity of @xmath13 collisions can be roughly estimated as @xmath135@xmath30s@xmath108 if the parameters of proton beam coincide with those of clic positron beam . in principle , this value can be increased by an order of magnitude due to improvement of proton beam parameters .",
    "the work on the subject , as well as on @xmath136 and fel @xmath18 options is under progress .",
    "it seems that neither hera nor lhc@xmath2 lep will be the end points for lepton - hadron colliders .",
    "linac - ring type @xmath13 machines and possibly @xmath10 colliders will give an opportunity to go far in this direction ( see table iii ) .",
    "however , more activity is needed both in accelerator ( further exploration of  dynamic  focusing scheme , a search for effective cooling methods etc . ) and physics search program aspects .",
