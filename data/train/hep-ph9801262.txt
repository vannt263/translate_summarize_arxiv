    "in this paper , we prove factorization for the deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) amplitude in qcd up to power suppressed terms , to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "this proof is important because of the recent great interest in dvcs @xcite .",
    "one important use of dvcs is as a probe of off - forward ( or nondiagonal ) distributions @xcite .",
    "these differ from the usual parton distributions probed in inclusive reactions by having a non - zero momentum transfer between the proton in the initial and final state .",
    "a related process which is also used to probe off - diagonal parton densities is exclusive meson production in deep - inelastic scattering @xcite , for which a proof of factorization was given in @xcite .",
    "compared with this process , dvcs is simpler because the composite meson in the final state is replaced by an elementary particle , the photon , and thus there is no meson wave function in the factorization formula .    in the case of a scalar field theory , anikin and zavialov",
    "@xcite proved a non - local operator product expansion , from which follows the factorization theorem for dvcs , as shown by mller et al.@xcite . from the point of view of these papers , the new results in the present paper consist of an extension of the results to qcd",
    "however , we do not derive an explicit form of an @xmath0-operation for the coefficient functions , unlike anikin and zavialov .    in a separate line of development , ji @xcite and radyushkin @xcite provided key insights that indicate that a factorization theorem is valid for dvcs , and then radyushkin provided an all - orders proof in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we provide an alternative proof , and give a new treatment of some problems that were treated in ref .",
    "@xcite but that were perhaps not fully solved .",
    "the primary technical difference between radyushkin s derivations and ours is that he uses the @xmath1-parametric representation for feynman graphs , whereas we use the momentum representation , which we consider to be more direct .",
    "our proof follows the general lines of proofs of factorization for other processes given in @xcite , and the most noteworthy feature is that , particularly for the case of production of off - shell photons , the proof is simpler than for any other process . even for ordinary deep - inelastic scattering one needs to discuss the cancellation of soft gluon exchanges and of final - state interactions , whereas these complications are not present in the leading power for dvcs .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : after stating the theorem in sec .  [",
    "sec : theorem ] , we show in sec .  [",
    "sec : proof ] how the proof given in ref .",
    "@xcite is readily adapted to dvcs .",
    "the complications mentioned above concern the situation when one of the two lines connecting the parton density to the hard scattering carries zero longitudinal momentum , and these are given a detailed treatment in sec .  [ subt ] .",
    "the process under consideration is dvcs which is the elastic scattering of virtual photons : @xmath2 where the diffracted proton @xmath3 may also be replaced by a low - mass excited state and the final - state photon can be either real or time - like .",
    "this process is the hadronic part of @xmath4 for a real photon or of @xmath5 for a time - like photon .",
    "it is convenient to use light - cone coordinates with respect to the collision axis ] ] .",
    "the momenta in the process then take the form : @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the bjorken scaling variable , @xmath8 is the virtuality of the initial photon , @xmath9 is the proton mass , @xmath10 is the momentum transfer squared , and @xmath11 is a parameter that specifies the virtuality of the outgoing photon : @xmath12 .",
    "thus , @xmath13 for a real photon and @xmath14 for a time - like photon .",
    "finally , @xmath15 means `` equality up to power suppressed terms '' .",
    "the theorem to be proved is that the amplitude for the process ( [ dvcs ] ) is : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a nondiagonal parton distribution and @xmath18 is the hard - scattering coefficient for scattering off a parton of type @xmath19 .",
    "we let @xmath20 be the momentum fraction of parton @xmath19 coming from the proton , so that @xmath21 is the momentum fraction which is returned to the proton by the other parton line joining the parton distribution and the hard scattering .",
    "there is implicit polarization dependence in the amplitude .",
    "@xmath22 is the usual renormalization / factorization scale , which should be of order @xmath23 to allow calculations of the hard scattering coefficients within finite - order perturbation theory .",
    "the @xmath22 dependence of @xmath17 is given by equations of the dglap and brodsky - lepage kind @xcite .",
    "the parton distributions in eq .",
    "( [ theorem ] ) , together with their evolution equations , are defined using the conventions of @xcite .",
    "they may easily be transformed into those given in @xcite by a change of normalization and of kinematic variables .",
    "the proof of our theorem eq .",
    "( [ theorem ] ) can be summarized as follows :    * establish the non - ultra - violet regions in the space of loop momenta contributing to the amplitude . *",
    "establish and prove a power counting formula for these regions . *",
    "determine the leading regions of the amplitude .",
    "* define the necessary subtractions in the amplitude to avoid double counting .",
    "* taylor expand the amplitude to obtain a factorized form . *",
    "show that the part containing the long - distance information can be expressed through matrix elements of renormalized , bi - local , gauge invariant operators of twist-@xmath24 .",
    "first let us establish the regions in the space of loop momenta contributing to the asymptotics of the amplitude , i.e. ,  the generalized reduced graphs .",
    "the steps leading to the generalized reduced graphs are identical to the steps 13 in sec .",
    "iv of ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. ,  scale all momenta by a factor @xmath25 , use the coleman - norton theorem to locate all pinch - singular surfaces in the space of loop momenta ( in the zero - mass limit ) , and finally identify the relevant regions of integration as neighborhoods of these pinch - singular surfaces .",
    "the results are the two kinds of reduced graph shown in fig.[reduced.graphs ] .",
    "there , @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote collinear graphs with one large momentum component in the @xmath28 and @xmath29 direction respectively , @xmath30 denotes the hard scattering graph , and @xmath31 denotes a graph with all of its lines soft , i.e. ,  in the center - of - mass frame all the components of the momenta in @xmath31 are much smaller than @xmath23 .",

    "but when the out - going photon has much lower virtuality than the incoming photon , for example , when it is real , we can also have the second kind of reduced graph , fig .",
    "[ reduced.graphs]b , where the out - going photon couples to a @xmath27 subgraph . as we will see later",
    ", power counting will show that the second kind of reduced graph , fig.[reduced.graphs]b , is power suppressed compared to the first kind , with a direct photon coupling .",
    "this implies that we will avoid all the complications which were encountered in @xcite that are associated with the meson wave function .",
    "each reduced graph codes a region of loop - momentum space , a neighborhood of the surface @xmath36 of a pinch singularity in the zero - mass limit .",
    "the contribution to the amplitude from a neighborhood of @xmath36 behaves like @xmath37 , modulo logarithms , in the large-@xmath23 limit , with the power given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number of collinear quarks , transversely polarized gluons , and external photons attaching to the hard subgraph @xmath30 .",
    "such results were obtained by libby and sterman @xcite .",

    "the well - known problem of gluons with scalar polarization ( see , for example , @xcite ) will be dealt with later on .",
    "suffice it to say here that gluons with such a polarization can be factorized into the parton distributions by using gauge - invariance arguments .",
    "the leading regions for the amplitude are those with the largest exponent @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ pform ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that these correspond to the reduced graphs in fig.[leading.regions ] , independently of whether the out - going photon is real or far off - shell .",
    "the corresponding power is @xmath41 .",
    "these reduced graphs have direct photon couplings to the hard subgraph , they have exactly two parton lines connecting the collinear subgraph @xmath26 to the hard subgraph @xmath30 , and they have no soft lines connecting to @xmath30 .",
    "the two kinds of graph differ only by the absence or presence of a soft subgraph that connects to @xmath26 alone .    among the other reduced graphs , which are non - leading for our process , are those of the type in fig .",
    "[ reduced.graphs]b , which are leading in the case of diffractive meson production , where the leading region gives @xmath42 .",
    "in the case of a photon that is off - shell by order @xmath8 , the amplitude for production of the photon behaves like @xmath41 , the same as for a real photon .",
    "however , the physically observed process includes the decay of the time - like photon ( to a @xmath43 , for example ) , which results in a power suppression of the observed cross section by @xmath44 compared with the cross section for making real photons .      as mentioned in sec .",

    "if the longitudinal components of @xmath51 are of order @xmath87 while the transverse components remain of order @xmath82 , then we get contributions of order @xmath88 from the denominators , @xmath89 from the phase space , and @xmath85 from the numerators , for a total of @xmath90 .",

    "it is only when the integration over @xmath51 is pinched in the region in question that it needs to be taken into account . in the dangerous region",
    "we have @xmath91 , so that the only @xmath92 dependence in eq .",
    "( [ u.soft ] ) is the pole in the fourth denominator .",
    "we can therefore deform @xmath92 into the complex plain a long way out of the region we are considering , indeed all the way to the collinear - to-@xmath26 region .",
    "then the collinear approximation is valid so that we can replace the graph by its contribution to the factorization formula .",
    "this contour deformation argument is completely general , as explained in sec .",
    "iiie of ref .",
    "whenever we have a soft momentum with @xmath91 , the contour of @xmath92 can be deformed away from poles in the jet subgraph associated with with the produced photon .",

    "the only potential leading twist contribution near the breakpoint is associated with the non - zero analytic term to which the contour deformation argument applies .    to prove this property of the parton density at a breakpoint , consider a general graph for the parton density , as shown in fig.[pargra ] .",
    "we have found it convenient to change the labeling of the momentum compared with the previous figure .",
    "as always , the @xmath80 and @xmath93 components of @xmath51 have been short circuited and are integrated over .",

    "here , @xmath97 is the fractional longitudinal momentum transfer @xmath98 .",
    "in addition there are poles from the collinear - to-@xmath26 in the blob .",
    "for example if the blob consists of a single line , we have a pole at @xmath99 or at @xmath100 .",
    "as we vary @xmath67 , the @xmath101 contour can generally be deformed to avoid the poles , so that we have analytic dependence on @xmath67 .",

    "a pinch never occurs ; in the general case this is a consequence of the landau rules .",
    "but endpoint singularities occur , and these are precisely at the breakpoints .",
    "for example if @xmath103 , then @xmath50 can approach @xmath104 from above and below . the pole giving us trouble",
    "stems from the @xmath51-line , all other propagators are unproblematic in this case , since their poles are at finite @xmath101 .",
    "the pole in @xmath80 approaches @xmath105 as one approaches @xmath106 and @xmath107 as one approaches @xmath108 .",
    "this means that the @xmath80 pole crosses the real axis at infinity .",
    "hence the parton distribution is non - analytic there .",
    "since the singularity is at @xmath109 the other propagators have large denominators , and hence we get a zero for the non - analytic part of integral at the breakpoint . thus the parton density is continuous at the breakpoint , as claimed .",
    "this result enables the factorization formula to be valid in the neighborhoods of the breakpoints .",
    "since the other poles in the @xmath101 integral are on opposite sides of the real axis , the parton distribution is non - zero at the breakpoints .",
    "effectively the crossover of the pole occurs when @xmath51 is in a collinear - to-@xmath27 region , which we know is power suppressed .",
    "this indicates that the argument we have just given generalizes to all graphs .",
    "we also remark on the behavior at the endpoints .",
    "let us look at the case @xmath110 .",
    "we find that another of the poles pole runs off to @xmath111 this time and crosses the real axis there .",
    "but now all the other poles are on a single side of the real axis , so that the sole contribution to the parton density comes from the pole at infinity , and hence there is a zero of the parton density at the endpoint .      using the definitions of the parton distributions and the hard scattering coefficients",
    "we finally obtain eq .",
