    "the model - hamiltonian ( [ eq_hamiltonian ] ) defines a non - trivial many - body problem that could be solved up to now only for some limiting cases @xcite .",
    "although it was soon realized , that the hubbard model is rather a generic model for antiferromagnetism , the question whether or not the hubbard model possesses ferromagnetic solutions continues to be the matter of controversial discussions . in this work we focus exclusively on ferromagnetic solutions of the single band hubbard model . what concerns ferromagnetism of real substances , as fe , co , ni",
    ", the direct heisenberg exchange , hund s rule coupling and band - degeneracy , of course , play an important role @xcite , the investigation of which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite applied to the hubbard model @xcite excludes ferromagnetism for one- and two - dimensional lattices .",
    "for the three dimensional system with infinitely strong coulomb repulsion ( @xmath15 ) exact results have been derived in a pioneering paper by nagaoka @xcite .",
    "for very special band fillings @xmath16 ( @xmath17 : number of lattice sites ) ferromagnetic ground states are possible ; in the case of bipartite ( sc and bcc ) lattices for @xmath18 as well as for @xmath19 , in the non - bipartite lattice ( fcc ) only for @xmath18 .",
    "this indicates that the possibility of ferromagnetism crucially depends on the lattice structure . for the hypercubic ( hc ) lattice at infinite dimensions",
    "fazekas et .",
    "@xcite showed that saturated ferromagnetism is excluded .",
    "however , in a recent study ulmke @xcite applied a finite temperature quantum monte carlo calculation to the hubbard model on a fcc lattice at infinite spatial dimensions .",
    "a highly polarized ferromagnetic ground state is found in a rather wide range of band occupation .",
    "it is to be supposed that the greatest chance of ferromagnetism to appear in the single band hubbard model is for non - bipartite lattices @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we want to investigate how sensible band ferromagnetism in the hubbard model depends on the lattice structure , and therewith on the density of states of the non - interacting electrons ( bloch density of states : bdos ) .",
    "we apply a `` spectral density approach '' ( sda ) the reliability of which , at least for the strong coupling limit , has been demonstrated in previous papers @xcite . the same approach has been applied to a somewhat generalized model of magnetism ( multiband hubbard model ) for the band ferromagnets fe , co , ni @xcite .",
    "the sda basically consists in a two - pole ansatz for the single - electron spectral density , justified by the rigorous moment analysis of harris and lange @xcite .",
    "the free parameter of the ansatz are self - consistently fixed by equating exactly calculated spectral moments .",
    "the sda turns out to be essentially equivalent to the roth method @xcite and to the mori projector formalism @xcite .    for several types of bdos",

    "the results are confirmed by a direct calculation of the spontaneous magnetic moment .",
    "however , the @xmath23-zeros are due to magnetic phase transitions of second order only , while additional first order transitions to a finite spontaneous moment may occur .",
    "the sda statements on the possibility of ferromagnetism in the hubbard model can be compared with recent results from the @xmath0-technique @xcite . as to the lattice structure dependence",
    "the sda solutions predict qualitatively the same trend .",

    "it can be justified by inspection of the lehmann representation of these functions that in the wave - vector representation they must represent two - pole functions as the original single - electron spectral density ( [ eq_spectral_density_e ] ) .",
    "the various functions ( [ eq_spectral_density_e ] ) and ( [ eq_spectral_density_a ] ) differ only by the spectral weights of the poles . for fixing @xmath45",

    "the poles of the susceptibility indicate the instabilities of the system towards ferromagnetic ordering . to calculate the static susceptibility @xmath20 we have to include a zeeman term in the hamiltonian ( [ eq_hamiltonian ] ) . when differentiating @xmath49 with respect to the external field one has to bear in mind that all expectation values @xmath33 are field - dependent .",
    "we have investigated the tendency to ferromagnetism in the single band hubbard model for several lattice structures and different spatial dimensions .",
    "the zeros of the inverse static paramagnetic susceptibility indicate the magnetic phase transitions of second order .",
    "[ fig_one ] shows the results for a sc lattice .",
    "sometimes it is argued @xcite that for this bipartite lattice ferromagnetism is hardly to be expected . on the other hand , shastry et .",
    "@xcite report for the @xmath3 model even saturated ferromagnetism for @xmath51 .",
    "that is very close to our findings .",
    "it is a special feature of the sda @xcite , possibly even for the hubbard model itself , that there are two ferromagnetic solutions , i. e. two zeros of @xmath23 .",
    "the first solution sets in at @xmath52 ( @xmath15 ) , where the actual value only slightly depends on @xmath9 .",
    "this solution runs into saturation for @xmath53 ( @xmath15 ) , in exact agreement with the results of ref .",
    "the second solution appears for higher band occupations , but does never reach saturation .",
    "this less magnetized solution is always less stable and can be disregarded in the following discussion . in spite of the appearance of ferromagnetic solutions the sc structure seems not to be very convenient for a spontaneous order .",
    "a rather strong coulomb coupling @xmath54 ( w : bloch bandwidth ) is needed . in this context",
    "it is interesting to look at the influence of the non - locality of the electronic self - energy ( [ eq_self - energy ] ) .",
    "the wave - vector dependence comes into play due to the higher correlation functions in @xmath39 ( [ eq_fsigma ] ) . since in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions",
    "the electronic self - energy is wave - vector independent @xcite , the role of the @xmath27-dependent terms in @xmath55 might be underestimated for @xmath3 . in part ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig_one ] we have plotted @xmath23 as function of the electron density for the case that the self - energy ( [ eq_self - energy ] ) has been made local simply by setting @xmath56 . the critical couplings @xmath28 for ferromagnetic order rises enormously from @xmath57 for the full @xmath27-dependent self - energy ( fig .  [ fig_one](a ) ) to @xmath58 for the local self - energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig_one](b ) ) . its influence on magnetic stability , however , is not for all cubic lattices of the same importance .",
    "it can be recognized that with increasing number of nearest neighbours the importance of the @xmath27-dependent part of the self - energy rapidly decreases . for the fcc lattice ( @xmath59 )",
    "it appears already non - remarkably @xcite .    in infinite spatial dimensions ,",
    "for which the higher correlation @xmath39 disappears , we do not find zeros in @xmath23 for the hypercubic lattice ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_two ] ) , and that irrespective of the strength of the coulomb coupling @xmath9 .",
    "phase transitions of second order are therefore excluded .",
    "the same fact has been reported by jarrell @xcite who elaborated a self - consistent monte carlo procedure , which is claimed to be essentially exact for the @xmath0 hubbard model .",
    "although there is no indication for ferromagnetism in the static susceptibility , the direct evaluation of the sda for the spin - dependent , averaged particle numbers @xmath60 , @xmath61 reveals ferromagnetic solutions ( fig .",
    "[ fig_two ] ) .",
    "they belong to first order transitions being therefore not visible as @xmath23-zeros .",
    "these solutions appear for rather strong coulomb couplings and for band occupations @xmath62 . for a given @xmath9 the @xmath63 curve forms a closed bubble steadily contracting itself for increasing temperature . for a given band occupation",
    "@xmath64 this means a first order transition at a certain critical temperature .",
    "ferromagnetic saturation is , strictly speaking , never reached , not even for @xmath65 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_two ] ) .",
    "this is because of the infinite tails of the gaussian bdos .",
    "the strict physical meaning of this kind of ferromagnetism in the hubbard model requires further investigation .",
    "it turns out that the three dimensional bcc lattice with its divergence at the center of the bdos is much more convenient for ferromagnetism than the sc lattice .",
    "already for @xmath66 two ferromagnetic solutions appear , the stable one starts for @xmath15 at @xmath67 reaching saturation ( m = n ) for @xmath51 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_three ] ) .",
    "the latter result is again in exact agreement with the findings in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the stability of the nagaoka state @xcite ( @xmath68 ) with respect to an electron spin flip is investigated . as already mentioned the @xmath27-dependence of the electronic self - energy has not such dramatic consequences as for the sc lattice ( fig .",

    "the non - bipartite fcc lattice does not allow ferromagnetism for less than half - filled energy bands .",
