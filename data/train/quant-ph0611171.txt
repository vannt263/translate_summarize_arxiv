    "quantum entangled states on a composite system are vital resources for many quantum information protocols @xcite , and it is important to understand how various entangled states are affected by decoherence when one of the local subsystems is interacted with the environment or is transferred over a noisy quantum channel . here",
    "we focus on the cases in which the effects of such a local quantum operation / channel are different on two different kinds of entanglement . in a typical situation",
    ", one input state has a large amount of entanglement and the other one has very small entanglement , but after applying a local quantum channel on one of the systems , the entanglement in the former state is completely destroyed while the latter state is still entangled . in other words ,",
    "the less entangled state is robust against the noises of the quantum channel that severely degrades the other type of entanglement .    when the dimension of hilbert space for the local system is more than two , namely , for a three - level or larger system , such an example is easy to find @xcite . since two levels ( a two - dimensional subspace ) are enough to form entanglement to another system , and there are different pairs of levels to choose , it is easy to imagine a quantum channel which completely destroys the coherence between a specific pair of levels , while leaving the coherence between another pair intact . if , however , the system in question is a qubit ( a two - level system ) , the problem becomes nontrivial because any entanglement must use the whole two - dimensional space .",

    "consider two pure states @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",

    "if we are to require the strict inequality , we need to restrict the allowed entanglement measures , which will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:4-strict - state ] .    in the above example",
    "of two - qutrit state ordering change , the entanglement in the state @xmath39 is completely destroyed by the channel . in this paper , we define such cases as follows : + _ selective entanglement breaking _  the state ordering change occurs with one of the output states being separable .",
    "moreover , in the trivial example considered here , the entanglement in state @xmath40 is preserved no matter how small its entanglement is .",

    "we will define such a phenomenon in the following way .",

    "the next section will deal with the nontrivial question for the case of a two - level system .",
    "in this section , we show an example of the selective entanglement breaking where the local system is a qubit . for two - qutrit system , it was not difficult to find the example of the strong selective entanglement breaking .",
    "this is because for three - level or larger systems we can preserve entanglement even if we apply a projector onto a two - dimensional subspace . but for a two - level input system , we can not preserve entanglement by nontrivial projections .",
    "it is thus difficult to find an example of two - qubit selective entanglement breaking along the line used in the previous section .    our strategy to find such an example is as follows .",
    "first we consider an entangled mixed state @xmath33 and a qubit channel @xmath49 with a parameter @xmath50 representing the amount of the noise introduced by the channel . after applying the local channel to the input state @xmath33",
    ", we calculate the negativity @xcite of state @xmath51 as a function of @xmath50 to find the value of @xmath52 at which the state becomes separable .",
    "next , going back to the original state @xmath33 , we apply a local unitary @xmath53 to the first system to produce @xmath54 .",
    "we again calculate the critical value @xmath55 for this state .",
    "the success of our strategy rests on whether the critical value @xmath55 changes depending on the choice of the unitary @xmath53 .",
    "once we find such a dependency , we can construct an example of the selective entanglement breaking as follows . without loss of generality",
    ", we can assume that there is a value of @xmath50 for which @xmath56 is separable , while the negativity of state @xmath51 is strictly positive .",
    "then , we consider an locc operation @xmath57 with parameter @xmath58 representing the strength of the noise ( @xmath59 ) , and apply it to state @xmath33 to obtain @xmath60 .",
    "if @xmath58 is small enough but nonzero , we have @xmath61 while the negativity of the new state @xmath62 should still be strictly positive , namely , @xmath63 .",
    "hence , for the negativity , the strict inequality ( [ eq : strict ] ) is satisfied ( see fig.1 ) . on the other hand",
    ", we can convert @xmath64 to @xmath65 by locc ( @xmath66 followed by @xmath67 ) , and we can also convert @xmath68 to @xmath56 by locc since the latter is separable . hence , from the monotonicity ( i ) , the inequality ( [ eq : withequality ] ) holds for any measure @xmath0 .     as an entanglement measure , since it is easy to calculate . slight decrease in the degree of entanglement ( the arrow )",
    "is done by locc , and hence the order of the two input states is measure - independent .",
    "the order of the two output states is also measure - independent , since one of them is separable .",
    "[ fig:1],width=325 ]    let us show a specific example using the above strategy .",
    "first we consider a mixed entangled state , @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "consider a local unitary on the first system @xmath71 , @xmath72 which is the rotation around @xmath73 axis by @xmath74 on the bloch sphere .",
    "let @xmath75 , which is written on the basis @xmath76 in the matrix form @xmath77    as the local quantum channel applied to system @xmath71 , we take a phase damping channel represented by two kraus operators @xmath78 where @xmath79 . for an input two - qubit state @xmath80 , the output of the phase damping channel is given by @xmath81 .",
    "for the two input states @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the output states are calculated as @xmath84    the negativity for a bipartite state @xmath85 is defined by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the minimum of the eigenvalues of the partial transpose of state @xmath85 @xcite . for two - qubit states , it has the range from 0 ( separable ) to 1 ( maximally entangled ) .",
    "the negativity of the two output states @xmath88 and @xmath89 are    , @xmath89 , @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) are indicated by the dotted curve , the dashed curve , and the solid curve , respectively .",
    "[ fig:2],width=325 ]    @xmath92    which are shown in fig .  2 .    when the noise parameter of the quantum channel is @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95",
    "then we decrease @xmath96 using locc .",
    "specifically , we consider an operation in which the state is replaced by @xmath97 with probability @xmath58 . applying this operation to @xmath98",
    ", we have @xmath99 where @xmath100 . calculating in a similar way",
    ", we obtain the negativity of the output state as @xmath101 the case with @xmath91 is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "as explained for the general strategy , @xmath102 and @xmath103 hold for any entanglement measure satisfying the monotonicity ( i ) . on the other hand , @xmath104 holds for @xmath105 and @xmath106 holds for @xmath107 .",
    "hence the phase damping channel with @xmath108 and the states @xmath109 and @xmath110 with @xmath111 exhibit the selective entanglement breaking .    in the limit of @xmath112 ,",
    "the state @xmath110 becomes separable .",
    "but as long as @xmath107 , the output state is still entangled , and the state ordering change occurs .",
    "hence the particular example here exhibits not only the selective entanglement breaking , but also the strong selective entanglement breaking .",
    "in the previous section , we present a specific example of selective entanglement breaking in which the two input states are mixed states .",
    "in fact , we can not find pure - state examples by our strategy .",
    "the reason is closely related to the following general property of qubit channels : if a two - qubit pure entangled state becomes separable after one of the qubit passes through a qubit channel , then the channel is an entanglement breaking channel @xcite , namely , the channel destroys the entanglement of any input state",
    ". we can prove it as follows .",
    "consider a two - qubit pure state @xmath113 , where @xmath114 , and suppose that @xmath115 becomes separable state @xmath116 after the application of a qubit channel .",
    "imagine we further apply a local filter , which is described by the kraus operator @xmath117 , to the second qubit .",
    "the state after the successful filtering , @xmath118 , is separable since @xmath116 is separable .",
    "now notice that even if we apply the local filter first and then apply the one - qubit channel , the final state should be the same because they are operations on different systems . in this case , the state after the successful filtering is a maximally entangled state @xmath119 , which evolves into the separable state @xmath120 after the application of the qubit channel .",
    "hence the channel must be an entanglement breaking channel .",
    "this property of qubit channels immediately tells us that there is no selective entanglement breaking with the input two - qubit state @xmath11 , which is to be broken , being a pure state .",
    "our strategy in sec .",
    "[ sec : qubit ] does not work for pure @xmath121 because @xmath55 is the same for any unitary operation @xmath53 .",
    "although there is no selective entanglement breaking for pure two - qubit states , the present argument does not exclude the possibility of the state ordering change for two pure two - qubit input states .",
    "for a system with dimension @xmath122 larger than two , a straightforward extension of the above proof shows that a local channel is entanglement breaking if a pure entangled state _ with full local rank _ ( the marginal density operator having rank @xmath122 ) is broken by the channel .",
    "this leaves the possibility of having the selective entanglement breaking of pure states with a small local rank , as in the trivial example shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : qutrit ] .",
    "as discussed in sec . [ sec : qutrit ] , not all of the entanglement measures satisfying the monotonicity ( i ) fulfill the strict inequality ( [ eq : strict ] ) .",
    "here we show that , in the example in sec .",
    "[ sec : qubit ] , the strict inequality ( [ eq : strict ] ) holds for a wide range of measures specified by a set of additional conditions which are often considered to be desirable as a measure of entanglement .",
    "we consider the measures satisfying the following properties : +   + ( i@xmath123)_monotonicity under locc on average _ , if locc transforms @xmath33 into a state @xmath124 with probability @xmath125 , the entanglement does not increase on average , i.e. @xmath126 ; + ( ii)_vanishing on separable states _ , @xmath127 if @xmath33 is separable ; + ( iii)_normalization _ , @xmath128 , where @xmath129 ; + ( iv)_convexity _ , @xmath130 ; + ( v)_partial additivity _ , @xmath131 ; + ( vi)_partial continuity _ , if state @xmath132 approaches @xmath133 for large @xmath134 : @xmath135 for @xmath136 , then @xmath137 . +   +",

    "we have shown examples of a local qubit channel exhibiting the selective entanglement breaking and an example with the strong selective entanglement breaking .",
    "these results imply that even for the system as small as a qubit , a quantum channel / operation can have a preference over which kind of entanglement to break . in our examples , the ordering with respect to entanglement is determined by the transformability through locc operations , and hence is defined solely by the property of monotonicity .",
