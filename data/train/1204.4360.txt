    "ever since baade and zwicky had coined the term super - novae and had suggested super - nova process as the end of an ordinary star to become a neutron star @xcite , supernovae have been puzzling scientific minds for decades .",
    "they are believed to be the catastrophic end of massive stars life cycle .",
    "supernovae other than the type ia standard candle , where the entire star is incinerated , are believed to have gone through a gravitational collapse of the iron core @xcite .",
    "the progenitor iron core with about @xmath0 radius is enclosed by the stellar hydrogen envelope extending out to some @xmath1 radius .",
    "the collapse of this progenitor core is governed by the sound speed profile , which decreases as the radial position increases .",
    "the infalling velocity in the outer part of the core is supersonic with respect to the local sound speed , while the inner part is subsonic with the interface at about @xmath2 radius .",
    "because of this condition , the outer part tends to pile up while the inner part continues to free - fall .",
    "this generates a proto - neutron star plus the overlying stellar material .",
    "a cavity is formed between the proto - neutron star and the hydrogen stellar envelope .",
    "the gravitational collapse of a magnetized massive star with jet formations was investigated @xcite , and an explosion mechanism not associated with nuclear detonation was proposed @xcite .",
    "some of the core - collapse supernovae appear to be associated to gamma - ray bursts @xcite . as a result , there could be a very close relationship between supernovae and gamma - ray bursts . by the extraordinary energy output ,",
    "serveral scenarios have been contemplated as the progenitors of gamma - ray bursts @xcite . for massive progenitor stars with more than 14 solar masses , like rapidly spinning wolf - rayet stars",
    ", the inner core could promptly collapse to a black hole circumscribed by a massive torus , failing to generate a core rebound in the cavity .",
    "accretion of the surrounding massive torus of nuclear density material at a later time drive an outburst along the rotational axis breaking out the stellar envelope .",
    "this is the collapsar ( or hypernova ) scheme @xcite . instead of promptly collapsing to a black hole",
    ", there also could be a two - stage collapse by first forming a rapidly rotating neutron star temporarily stabilized by rotation , and later collapses to a black hole after losing some angular momentum , which is the supranova @xcite scheme for long gamma - ray bursts .",
    "when the inner core does not collapse to a black hole , it rebounces as the inner core reaches nuclear densities , generating a rebounding shock in the cavity .",
    "the release of the gravitational binding energy through neutrino bursts has been considered as the primary candidate in fueling the supernova explosion @xcite . nevertheless , as this outgoing shock meets the infalling outer very thick envelope , energy of the shock wave",
    "gets dissipated , and the shock is stalled . by which energy source and mechanism that the shock could be reignited is still an unsettled issue .",
    "recently , polarimetry observations of supernova optical emissions have revealled different degrees of polarization along a fixed axis of the supernova . in a very collisional environment of a supernova ,",
    "this polarization result implies a nonzero volume average of the microscopically random electric field vector of each emission , indicating supernovae , or some them , are aspherical @xcite . in view of other astrophysical ejection events",
    "known to be powered by magnetic fields , these polarization observations have given grounds to reexamine the magnetic field as the central engine for supernova @xcite .",
    "the primary concern in this renewed magnetic approach is the magnetic collimation mechanism .",
    "it has been proposed the presence of an accretion disk within the cavity of the collapsing iron core , by which magnetic towering @xcite and jets @xcite could be generated along the rotational axis .    should magnetic field be the energy source of supernova",
    ", a simple estimation indicates that the surface fields of the rapidly rotating proto - neutron star would be around @xmath3 , which qualifies it as a magnetar .",
    "such magnetar scenario could be acomplished if the rotation of the proto - neutron star is fast enough . with millisecond periods , dynamo effects inside the pulsar",
    "could be triggered , enhancing the magnetic fields by a factor of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "these magnetic fields would be launched from the magnetosphere together with the plasma to fill the cavity , leaving a normal spun - down neutron star at the center after supernova explosion . in general , the dynamics of this cavity driven by the rapidly rotating inner core is referred to as the pulsar in a cavity model @xcite .",
    "simulation has been the principle tool in investigating the dynamics in this cavity @xcite . most frequently , an accretion disk scenario with magnetic fields anchored on it is considered . under given initial conditions , magnetic towering @xcite due to the angular momentum of the disk generates a collimating magnetic column along the polar axis .",
    "here , we seek to describe the cavity structures , filled with plasma and magnetic fields , through a sequence of axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) steady states ( equilibria ) with poloidal and toroidal plasma rotations as a response to the increasing plasma pressure . this type of steady state analysis has been used to gain important insights of dynamic processes such as astrophysical jets in terms of spatially self - similar mhd equilibria @xcite and magnetic towering in terms of magnetostatic analysis of disk driven equilibria @xcite .",
    "the present problem differs from the relativistic pulsar wind problem with hot plasma @xcite especially under self - similar analysis @xcite and with cold plasma @xcite in that the spatial domain is bounded and very finite .    in sec.2 ,",
    "the axisymmetric divergence - free rotational mhd formulation is briefly presented , and in sec.3 , by assigning two source functions , the grad - shafranov equation for rotational equilibrium is obtained .",
    "the nonlinear poloidal flux function is solved in sec.4 for asymmetric supernova configuration in the cavity , whereas cusp - like funnel polar collimated gamma - ray burst jet configuration is solved in sec.5 .",
    "active galactic nucleus plasma torus and some conclusions are finalized in sec.6 .",

    "this set of equations is quite inconvenient .",
