    "recently , the investigation of loop quantum cosmology ( for a review see @xcite ) in homogeneous and isotropic universes has indicated that the classical big - bang singularity can be replaced with a big - bounce @xcite . in these scenarios gravity",
    "can be interpreted as becoming repulsive in the planckian high energy regime , implying that our current expanding universe would have been preceded by a contracting phase .",
    "the presence of a big - bounce has been shown to be a rather generic and genuine feature of the quantum gravitational effects of loop quantum cosmology and does not require any exotic matter which violates energy conditions @xcite .",
    "an exciting fact of bouncing cosmological models is that the scales measured in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) can be in causal contact if the current expanding phase is preceded by a contracting one , thus opening the possibility for a replacement of the standard inflationary scenario .    in order to more fully develop this scenario",
    ", one must go beyond the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "it is both the inhomogeneities and anisotropies that are expected to grow in a collapsing phase and thus a proper accounting of these fluctuations is required .",
    "one particular question that immediately arises is whether the presence of the bounce is stable under the inclusion of inhomogeneities and anisotropies . a proper description of the inhomogeneous perturbations and anisotropies",
    "would then provide an answer to the question of whether a suitable alternative to inflation can be constructed , and/or what possible cosmological signatures may result .    in this paper we do not seek to answer all these questions as work on including inhomogeneities in loop quantum cosmology is in its infancy ( initial progress can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "instead , we will focus on the behavior of anisotropies , studying the dynamics of the anisotropic bianchi i model in the framework of loop quantum cosmology . in the classical bianchi i universe sourced with matter with zero anisotropic stress , the anisotropic shear term behaves as an effective matter component with energy density that scales as @xmath1 in the friedmann equation with @xmath2 being the mean scale factor . thus for matter with equation of state @xmath3",
    ", the anisotropies will dominate the collapsing phase as the singularity is approached .",
    "if the current expanding phase of the universe was preceded by a collapsing phase , the inclusion of anisotropies can be expected to play a significant result near the bounce .",
    "the loop quantization of the anisotropic bianchi i model was initially studied in @xcite and more recently in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will study the dynamics of the model at the level of effective classical equations of motion that incorporate quantum effects arising from the loop quantum einstein equations . at the level of the effective equations we study ,",
    "we show that the big - bounce is indeed robust under the inclusion of non - linear anisotropies .",
    "we will show that the anisotropic shear remains finite through the bounce and that if matter with equation of state @xmath3 is included , the universe isotropizes in the expanding phase .",
    "the results represent evidence that the bouncing scenario of loop quantum cosmology is robust when the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy are relaxed and gives hope that the same can be said when inhomogeneous perturbations are properly included in the theory .",
    "we start with the classical setup for the bianchi i model .",
    "loop quantum cosmology is based on a hamiltonian formulation and thus we will define the hamiltonian for the gravitational plus matter degrees of freedom .",
    "hamilton s equations of motion then are equivalent to einstein s equations for the model considered",
    ". since the starting point of the quantization is the hamiltonian , it is there that we will incorporate the quantum effects in a modified effective hamiltonian to be introduced in the next section .    starting with the dynamical variables that comprise the classical phase space",
    ", we have three triad variables @xmath4 and three connection variables @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "the classical metric given in terms of the directional scale factors @xmath7 is ds^2 = -n^2 dt^2 + a_1 ^ 2 dx^2 + a_2 ^ 2 dy^2 + a_3 ^ 2 dz^2 with @xmath8 representing the lapse which is a freely specified function representing the freedom to redefine the time variable , and the coordinates @xmath9 are all valued on the entire real line ( we are not considering a compactified model ) .",
    "the triad variables are directly related to the scale factors as [ eqn : p and a ] |_1|=a_2a_3,|_2|=a_1a_3,|_3|=a_1a_2 .",
    "thus the triad variables encode information about the spatial geometry .",
    "the connection @xmath5 will encode information about the curvature ( essentially time derivatives of the scale factors ) as will be evident once hamilton s equations are solved .    in the hamiltonian framework ,",
    "the classical equations of motion are derived from a hamiltonian obtained by inserting the homogeneous phase space variables into the hamiltonian of general relativity making it a functional of @xmath4 and @xmath5 in this case . however",
    ", a non - triviality arises from the spatial integrations in the hamiltonian .",
    "because of homogeneity , these integrations diverge since we are considering the non - compact bianchi i model . to overcome this ,",
    "the spatial integrations can be restricted to a finite sized fiducial cell with fiducial volume @xmath10 .",
    "we can use the fiducial cell to define untilded variables @xmath11 as [ eqn : puntild ] p_i = ^2/3 _ i , c_i = ^1/3 _ i . in the classical theory",
    ", one can freely rescale the coordinates @xmath9 while leaving the physics invariant . under this rescaling",
    ", one can show that the untilded variables @xmath11 are invariant .",
    "since the quantization is based on the untilded variables , the quantum theory is manifestly invariant under this coordinate rescaling .",
    "this is entirely analogous to the non - compact isotropic @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite models where the same procedure is used .    with the understanding that the spatial integrations in the hamiltonian are restricted to the fiducial cell",
    ", the total hamiltonian of the model is given by [ eqn : cl hamiltonian ] h&=&h_grav+h_matter + & = & ( c_2p_2c_3p_3+c_1p_1c_3p_3+c_1p_1c_2p_2 ) + & & + h_m . with @xmath14 being the matter hamiltonian .",
    "here we have @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is known as the barbero - immirzi parameter and represents a quantum ambiguity of loop quantum gravity which is a non - negative real valued parameter .",
    "two sets of equations of motion derived from the hamiltonian then govern the dynamics . first , the hamiltonian of gravity and matter is of the constrained type whereby it vanishes identically for solutions to einstein s equations .",
    "thus an equation of motion is given by [ eqn : ham=0 ] h= 0 .",
    "second , hamilton s equations give the time evolution of any phase space variable through the poisson bracket : = \\ { p_i , h } , = \\",
    "{ c_i , h}. the poisson structure of the gravitational variables leads to the only non - vanishing poisson brackets \\{c_i , p_j}=_ij . with this ,",
    "hamilton s equations for @xmath17 and @xmath18 are given by [ eqn : cl hamilton s eq ] = - , = .",
    "to proceed further with the equations of motion , we must specify the matter hamiltonian .",
    "we take it to be of form h_m = n  _ m with @xmath19 being the matter energy density . in this paper , we assume that the matter has zero anisotropic stress which implies that @xmath20 couples to @xmath18 in the form [ rhomassum]_m(p_1 , p_2 , p_3 ) = _ m(p_1 p_2 p_3 ) .",
    "this assumption is true for scalar fields and perfect fluids which we will concentrate on in this paper .",
    "additionally , to derive the equations of motion we must specify the form of the lapse .",
    "for simplicity of the resulting equations , let us choose a form given by n= , which means we are using a different time @xmath21 variable than the usual cosmic time @xmath22 given by dt=(p_1 p_2 p_3)^-1/2dt .",
    "note that the choice of lapse is arbitrary and none of the physical results depend on the choice .",
    "we now derive the classical equations of motion .",
    "the hamiltonian with our choice of lapse is [ ham ] h&=&- ( c_2c_3p_2p_3+c_1c_3p_1p_3+c_1c_2p_1p_2 ) + & & + p_1p_2p_3_m .",
    "the first set of hamilton s equations in ( [ eqn : cl hamilton s eq ] ) for the time evolution of the triad then yields for instance [ eqn : cl dp / dt ] = ( c_2p_2+c_3p_3 ) . using the relations between the triad components and scale factors ( [ eqn : p and a ] ) and ( [ eqn : puntild ] )",
    ", we can solve these equations for the connection coefficients @xmath17 to get [ eqn : cl a dot ] c_i= ^-2/3(a_1a_2a_3)^-1 ^1/3 .",
    "these relations therefore provide us with the interpretation of the connection components as containing information about the curvature , which in the the bianchi i model is entirely encoded as the extrinsic curvature here proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "the next set of hamilton s equations in ( [ eqn : cl hamilton s eq ] ) for the time evolution of the connection yields for instance [ eqn : cl dc / dt ] & = & -(c_2p_2+c_3p_3 ) + & & + p_2p_3(_m+p_1 ) .",
    "combining ( [ eqn : cl dp / dt ] ) and ( [ eqn : cl dc / dt ] ) gives a key relation [ eqn : cl dpc / dt ] ( p_ic_i)= p_1p_2p_3(_m+p_i ) .",
    "it is here we use our assumption that the matter has zero anisotropic stress ( [ rhomassum ] ) .",
    "this assumption implies @xmath24 and thus ( [ eqn : cl dpc / dt ] ) yields [ eqn : cl key relation ] ( p_ic_i - p_jc_j)=0 , which can be integrated to give [ aij ] p_i c_i - p_j c_j = _ ij with @xmath25 being a constant anti - symmetric @xmath26 matrix satisfying by construction @xmath27 and the factors of @xmath28 are chosen for convenience . written in terms of the scale factors",
    "this implies [ hsol ] h_i - h_j = for the directional hubble rates ( in terms of cosmic time @xmath29 ) [ hi ] h_i .    using and the vanishing of the hamiltonian ,",
    "we can write down a generalized friedmann equation . the vanishing of the hamiltonian gives in terms of the hubble rates [ rsol ] h_1 h_2 + h_1 h_3 + h_2 h_3 = _ m . let us next define the mean scale factor @xmath2 as a = ( a_1 a_2 a_3)^1/3 , from which the following relation holds [ adot ] = ( h_1 + h_2 + h_3 ) . this relation implies ( ) ^2 & = & ( h_1 h_2 + h_1 h_3 + h_2 h_3 ) + + & & . finally , using and ,",
    "the generalized friedmann equation becomes [ friedeqn ] ( ) ^2 = _ m + , where @xmath30 is given in terms of the constants of motion @xmath31 as ^2 ( _ 12 ^ 2 + _ 23 ^ 2 + _ 31 ^ 2 )",

    "can then be determined from a combination of and , once @xmath33 is known .",
    "let us discuss the interpretation of the generalized friedmann equation .",
    "we first recognize the isotropic matter term @xmath35 on the right hand side with the anisotropic shear term behaving as a stiff fluid with equation of state @xmath36 .",
    "the isotropic limit is achieved when @xmath37 which from the relations implies that the directional hubble rates @xmath38 are identical indicating isotropic expansion . because the shear terms scales as @xmath1 , for typical forms of matter the early universe can be anisotropy dominated , with matter then dominating the later stages . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath0 , the later stages of expansion tend to a more isotropic state , whereby the hubble rates become identical in all directions .",
    "oppositely , as the singularity is approached , the universe behaves like a vacuum universe as the shear term dominates the matter term and kasner like behavior occurs .",
    "this behavior is desribed in more detail in appendix [ app1 ] .    as an example , let us consider a dust filled ( @xmath39 ) bianchi i universe with matter density @xmath40 .",
    "the generalized friedmann equation can be solved analytically giving a(t ) = ^1/3 , which gives the standard dust filled isotropic behavior at late times @xmath41 while at early times is anisotropy dominated @xmath42 and is singular at @xmath43 .",
    "the time evolution of the individual scale factors can then be determined from and , which gives for instance [ a1 ] a_1(t ) = ( + ) ^ a(t ) .",
    "let us consider the situation where initially @xmath44 is contracting with the other two directions expanding .",
    "in this case we have @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "it is easy to see from , that at late times @xmath47 behaves as @xmath48 and thus is _ expanding _ in accordance with the isotropic behavior . at early times , however , it is not too difficult to show that implies contraction ( @xmath49 ) and thus the scale factor bounces at some finite time and eventually the universe isotropizes to a matter dominated phase",
    ". therefore with matter with equation of state @xmath0 , the universe can initially be in a kasner like epoch with one direction contracting and the other two expanding ; eventually , however , such a universe will isotropize giving expansion in all three directions .",
    "thus , at the classical level the anisotropies are expected to play an important role as the singularity is approached . in the isotropic setting of loop quantum cosmology , the bouncing scenario has been well described in terms of an effective friedmann equation of the form @xcite h^2 = _ m ( 1- ) with @xmath50 being a critical energy density of planckian order .",
    "when the matter density reaches the critical density , @xmath51 indicating a bounce . because the bounce occurs in the high energy regime near the classical singularity , it is important to include the effects of the anisotropies . in the next section",
    "we will answer the question as to what role the anisotropies play in the bouncing scenario .",
    "as we have stated , the quantum modifications due to loop quantum cosmology that we study exhibit themselves in the form of a modified effective hamiltonian .",
    "since we study effective _ classical _ equations of motion , we are by definition ignoring certain quantum degrees of freedom . properly speaking , in the quantum theory",
    ", dynamics is understood through expectation values of observables calculated from semi - classical wave packets .",
    "thus additional effects which we do not study can arise from features of the semi - classical state such as the spread and so forth .",
    "the effective quantum modifications we study to first order are insensitive to the features of the semi - classical wavefunction and are expected to be valid provided the wavepacket remains sharply peaked though the evolution . that this is a good approximation has been verified in the isotropic models of lqc sourced with a massless scalar field@xcite , where the quantum dynamics have been extensively developed and understood .",
    "note that the effective equations we consider are somewhat heuristically motivated and more systematic approaches to deriving effective equations have been considered @xcite , but ultimately proper justification of any effective scheme requires the study of the quantum dynamics .",
    "the main quantum effect arises from the fact that in lqc , the connection variables @xmath17 do not have direct quantum analogues and are replaced by holonomies ( roughly exponentials of the connection ) .",
    "this manifests itself in the effective hamiltonian by replacing the classical @xmath17 terms with sine functions c_i , where @xmath52 are real valued functions of the triad coefficients @xmath18 which are a measure of the discreteness in the quantum theory .",
    "classical behavior is expected in the limit when @xmath53 whence @xmath54 .    in the original construction of lqc ,",
    "the @xmath52 were taken to be constants ( referred to as @xmath55)@xcite ; however it has been shown that in the isotropic case this can lead to the wrong semi - classical limit@xcite . in the isotropic case",
    "it has been argued that @xmath56 should not be a constant , but should scale as @xmath57 which has been shown to have a nice semi - classical limit@xcite .",
    "extending this scheme to the bianchi i model is slightly more ambiguous as several possibilities exist .",
    "we choose in this paper to focus on the scheme proposed in @xcite where @xmath52 are given by [ mubar ] |_i=  , where @xmath58 is the _ area gap _ in the full theory of lqc and @xmath59 is the planck length .",
    "an alternative scheme would be to have @xmath60 which we will briefly discuss in appendix  [ altmubar ] .",
    "however the main physical results we will describe do not depend sensitively on either of the scheme ; only the quantitative results would change . better input from the full theory might provide justification for either scheme .",
    "one advantage of the scheme is that it is more amenable to the study of dynamics with semi - classical states in the quantum theory , as the resulting difference equation is much simpler .",
    "this would allow for the test of the validity of the results presented here , by examining semi - classical state behavior in the quantum theory .",
    "additional modifications due to loop quantum cosmology have been studied extensively in the isotropic setting and pertain to operator eigenvalues of inverse @xmath18 factors that would appear in the matter part of the effective hamiltonian . in the isotropic setting this amounts to replacing factors of @xmath61 in the matter hamiltonian by an operator eigenvalue function @xmath62 which is bounded and vanishes at @xmath63 corresponding to the classical singularity .",
    "these corrections have been typically been ignored , but see @xcite for work on some cosmological implications . ]",
    "additionally an ambiguity parameter @xmath64 appears such that larger values amplify the @xmath65 effects . in this paper",
    "we will for simplicity ignore these effects in accordance with arguments that @xmath64 should take its smallest value @xcite , as well as questions as to the ambiguous nature of the critical scale at which the corrections are appreciable .",
    "further discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "our results presented here will remain valid as long as the critical scale remains below the scale at which the bounce occurs . in lieu of this , in our analysis the matter energy density @xmath20 appearing in the effective hamiltonian will not contain factors of @xmath65 and will assume the classical form .    with these caveats in mind , the effective hamiltonian with lapse @xmath66 is given by [ eqn : qm hamiltonian ] h_eff&= & - \\ { p_2p_3 + & & + } + p_1p_2p_3_m and it becomes easy to see that in the limit of small @xmath67 , the classical hamiltonian is recovered .",
    "hamilton s equations proceed in the same fashion as the classical setup .",
    "the equations for @xmath68 and @xmath69 give for instance [ eqn : qm dp / dt ] = \\{p_2 + p_3 } and [ eqn : qm dc / dt ] & = & - ( - ) + & &  \\{p_2 + p_3 } + & & + p_2p_3(_m+p_1 ) .",
    "hamilton s equations are now more complicated since the discreteness parameters @xmath52 depend on @xmath18 , but let us define @xmath70 as [ gi ] _",
    "i(t ) : = p_i , which can be shown to satisfy [ gdot ] = ( |_ic_i ) p_1p_2p_3 ( _ m + p_i ) .",
    "the vanishing of the hamiltonian gives [ eqn : qm h=0 ] ^2",
    "p_1 p_2 p_3 _ m = _ 1 _ 2 + _ 1 _ 3 + _ 2 _ 3 .",
    "note that the classical limit is attained by @xmath71 , where we have @xmath72 , @xmath73 and therefore ( [ eqn : qm dp / dt ] ) , ( [ eqn : qm dc / dt ] ) , ( [ gdot ] ) reduce to their classical counterparts ( [ eqn : cl dp / dt ] ) , ( [ eqn : cl dc / dt ] ) , ( [ eqn : cl dpc / dt ] ) .    at this stage , the equations are too complicated to solve analytically as was possible classically . to get a handle for the evolution",
    ", we can consider as an example , the case of a massless scalar field with equation of state @xmath36 whereby the equations simplify considerably . with a massless scalar field , we have _",
    "m = , where the momentum @xmath74 is a constant of motion .",
    "therefore , the term @xmath75 in vanishes identically . from this",
    "we find that @xmath76 are all constants in time .",
    "equation then implies that the triad components are all bounded as p_i ( |_i| ) ^2/3 , implying that the classical singularity is never approached .",
    "one can show from the equations of motion , that @xmath77 when @xmath78 implying that the individual triad components @xmath18 bounce and hence the whole universe must bounce . with this bound one can show that no curvature invariants blow up , and the dynamics is non - singular .",
    "vanishes whence @xmath18 is not constrained above a minimum value . however , this is the special case when @xmath18 is a constant which can be seen from .",
    "therefore the specific triad component does not become zero and the evolution remains non - singular . ] note that this analysis holds for the vacuum case if @xmath79 .",
    "therefore a bounce would occur generically for the vacuum case also .",
    "thus , at least with a massless scalar field , the bounce is robust under the inclusion of anisotropies . next we can monitor the behavior of the anisotropic shear term through the bounce for this example . if we look at the shear parameter @xmath30 we showed that classically it remains constant throughout the evolution . with the loop quantum modifications we can monitor its behavior by using its definition ^2 : = ( ( h_1-h_2)^2 + ( h_2-h_3)^2 + ( h_3-h_1)^2 ) , which in the classical case was a constant because of equation . in the lqc case ,",
    "let us assume we start with a nearly classical contracting universe with each @xmath80 . in this limit from we find _",
    "i p_i c_i .",
    "since @xmath76 are constant for the massless scalar field , we can identify them with the classical constants @xmath31 from as @xmath81 .",
    "the shear factor @xmath30 is then given initially as ^2 ( ) ( ( _ 1 - _ 2)^2 + ) .",
    "after the bounce , the constancy of @xmath76 and equation imply that @xmath67 become small as @xmath18 grow and hence classical behavior is recovered at late times .",
    "we can apply the same argument to conclude that the late time behavior of @xmath30 approaches the pre - bounce value in terms of the same constants @xmath76 : ^2 ( ) = ^2 ( ) and hence the shear factor @xmath30 is conserved before and after the bounce .",
    "using equations and , it is not too difficult to show that the shear term remains finite through the bounce indicating that the anisotropies do not blow up .",
    "the similar conclusions can be obtained for the generic cases with the inclusion of arbitrary matter with @xmath3 .",
    "the details of the effective loop quantum dynamics with generic perfect fluids are investigated in appendix  [ app2 ] .",
    "the detailed analysis shows that individual @xmath18 in different directions can bounce at slightly different moments .",
    "moreover , there is competition between the matter energy density @xmath82 and the _ directional density _",
    "@xmath83 ( defined in ( [ eqn : directional density ] ) , which is associated with the classical anisotropic shear ) to be dominant when the quantum corrections start to become significant . as a result , depending on how energetic the matter content",
    "is ( compared to the degree of anisotropies ) , the bounce can take place either in the `` kasner phase '' or in the `` isotropized phase '' ( or in the `` transition phase '' in between ) .",
    "if quantum corrections take effect in the isotropized phase , the bounce happens around the moment when @xmath82 approaches @xmath84 , giving similar results as in the isotropic model . on the other hand ,",
    "if the bounce occurs in the kasner phase , the individual triad components bounce when @xmath83 approach @xmath85 .    in the case",
    "that the big bounce occurs in the isotropized phase , the kasner fashion of the classical solution is smeared by the quantum effect and thus the information of anisotropies is blurred . therefore , on the other side of the bounce , the classical anisotropic shear is changed .",
    "this explains why @xmath86 in general . only in the case when the big bounce takes place in the kasner phase",
    "do we have @xmath87 .",
    "exactly for these two special cases . ]    in the next section we explicitly show the results mentioned here by numerically solving the equations of motion .",
    "owing to the complexity of the effective equations of motion , we can not go further in the analytical analysis for more general forms of matter . in this section",
    "we will present some numerical simulations of the equations of motion by including other forms of matter .",
    "in particular we will focus on whether a bounce occurs for an initially contracting universe and how the shear term @xmath30 behaves through the bounce .",
    "additionally we will show that the universe isotropizes after the bounce with the inclusion of @xmath88 matter .",
    "the differential equations for the time evolution of @xmath89 and @xmath90 are given in and .",
    "numerically we solve the equations given a lapse @xmath8 equal to one and plot as a function of cosmic time @xmath22 .",
    "the initial conditions are chosen consisting of a collapsing semi - classical universe such that @xmath91 and @xmath53 .",
    "the shear term @xmath30 is monitored using the classical formula .",
    "the first example we consider is the vacuum case .",
    "the analysis can be understood analytically as a special case of the massless scalar field studied in the previous section .",
    "the same analysis holds when @xmath92 which gives the vacuum case .",
    "therefore , for a vacuum case a bounce is generic and the shear term @xmath93 is conserved before and after the bounce .",
    "the mean scale factor @xmath33 , directional scale factors @xmath34 , and shear term @xmath94 are plotted in figures [ asvacuum ] and [ ssqvacuum ] respectively , for a representative numerical simulation consisting of an initially contracting universe which in the vacuum kasner case requires two contracting directions and one expanding . after the bounce , the universe consists of a kasner like expanding phase with growth in two directions and contraction in the other . throughout the evolution ,",
    "the shear term remains finite with the behavior during the bounce showing no obvious pattern ( from numerical simulations , the exact behavior can depend on initial conditions and choice of matter ) .",
    "however , it is clear that the post - bounce value tends to the pre - bounce value as shown by the analytical arguments of the previous section .",
    "the inclusion of a massless scalar field does not change the results of the vacuum case significantly . with matter",
    ", the initial contracting phase can be either one where all directions contract , or a kasner like contraction as in the vacuum case . in figures",
    "[ asstiff ] and [ ssqstiff ] , the scale factors and shear term are plotted for the case where all three directions initially are contracting .",
    "again , the shear term is finite through the evolution and the post - bounce value approaches the pre - bounce value , as expected from the analytical analysis .        as an example of the inclusion of other forms of matter",
    ", we consider a radiation ( @xmath95 ) field with energy density _",
    "m = with @xmath96 some constant .",
    "the numerical behavior of the scale factor appears in figure [ asrad ] , where again the bounce occurs .",
    "various initial conditions were examined and in all cases the bounce occurred providing evidence that it is a general feature of the effective hamiltonian we study in this paper .",
    "in contrast to the massless scalar field case , the shear term is not conserved after the bounce .",
    "this is shown in figure [ ssqrad ] , and for the particular initial conditions chosen , actually decreases in the post - bounce regime .",
    "it must be stated that the decrease is not a generic feature and is sensitive to the initial conditions . however , as in the previous cases , the shear term is finite through the entire evolution .            since the equation of state for the radiation field @xmath97",
    ", the post - bounce regime leads to an isotropization of the universe .",
    "this is borne out in the numerical simulations in figure [ hubsrad ] .",
    "there are plotted ratios of the directional hubble ratios .",
    "the ratios approach unity in the post - bounce epoch indicating identical expansion rates in the three directions .",
    "let us restate the main results presented . we have consider the anisotropic bianchi i model with loop quantum corrections to the classical equations of motion .",
    "we have shown that a bounce occurs under rather generic conditions in a collapsing universe .",
    "the anisotropic shear term @xmath98 , which classically grows during collapse and blows up at the singularity , remains finite through the bounce . after the bounce",
    ", the universe behaves more and more classically and can isotropize at later times .",
    "this is thus evidence that the bouncing scenario of the isotropic models of loop quantum cosmology is robust when the symmetries of the isotropic model are relaxed .",
    "we must reiterate the caveats that has gone into this analysis .",
    "first , we have used entirely the effective classical equations of motion determined from the effective hamiltonian .",
    "this effective hamiltonian is motivated from the construction of the quantum hamiltonian operator in a somewhat heuristic fashion . in principle , however , there can be additional modifications arising from the quantum theory . to properly justify the analysis here , more work is required to analyze the quantum dynamics by constructing semi - classical states and evolving them with the quantum difference equation .",
    "the accuracy of the effective equations of motion has been established in the isotropic case with a massless scalar field , and thus we expect that they should give an accurate representation of the dominant corrections arising in the quantum dynamics .",
    "in addition , we have ignored the inverse triad effects arising in loop quantum cosmology .",
    "one might ask if we do include these effects , does the bounce picture still hold . yet",
    ", we can answer this by noting that the inverse triad modifications tend to suppress the matter energy density .",
    "thus if the suppression is large , the universe behaves more like a vacuum bianchi i model .",
    "our analysis indicates that the bounce still occurs in this case .",
    "therefore , the inverse triad effects are not expected to remove the bounce , and only change the quantitative behavior .",
