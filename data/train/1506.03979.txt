    "experiments in composite systems looking for a negative index of refraction ( both permittivity and permeability being negative ) at gigahertz frequencies@xcite were the first of this kind aiming at controlling the flow of electromagnetic waves ; indeed , some fascinating properties have been since explored based on such composites .",
    "however , to scale down these properties , not found in natural media , from the gigahertz regime to the optical domain , has posed a major challenge @xcite , especially with regard to the negative magnetic permeability @xcite ( negative electric response is trivial in the optical domain with metals ) . despite some drawbacks of the original design , as for instance anisotropy , the initial philosophy to achieve this goal was to miniaturize the original ones , namely , split - ring resonators , magneto - dielectric elements , and related @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the saturation of the magnetic response at high frequencies restricts this approach to the far infrared @xcite .",
    "other designs have been proposed that somehow mimic their behavior @xcite , one of the most widely employed being metallic fishnets @xcite . the emergence of ohmic losses in metals in the optical domain hinders also their performance .    to overcome this problem ,",
    "various attempts have been made by exploiting magnetic resonances occurring in structures made of high - permittivity materials @xcite , some of them combined with secondary plasmonic structures providing the electrical response @xcite .",
    "very recently , semiconductor nanostructures exhibiting magnetic resonances have been proposed as possible non - absorbing metamaterial elements as well as emitters with unusual properties @xcite .",
    "actually , simple arrangements based on this idea have been proposed such as core - shell 3d and 2d metallo - dielectric nanostructures , respectively , nanospheres and nanowires , geometrically tuned so that their two first order mie resonances ( magnetic and electric ) spectrally overlap , which might play the role of doubly - resonant meta - atoms @xcite , directional scatterers @xcite , and transparent nanowires @xcite . beside their robustness and isotropy stemming from their highly symmetric , single - structure meta - atoms , a theoretical figure of merit @xmath0 of the order of @xmath1 , has been reported in the case of core - shell nanowire ( nw ) arrays @xcite . incidentally , nw arrays have been proposed in turn as hyperbolic metamaterials @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a full description of their wave propagation properties must be done to determine whether their negative refraction behavior is a photonic - crystal diffraction effect that depends on the geometry sample , or a fully isotropic effective negative - index behavior ( which we will referred to as negative - index metamaterial , nim ) .",
    "in fact , it has been pointed out in ref .   that the constitutive parameters retrieved through effective medium theories in other dielectric - rod ordered arrays do not reproduce the negative refraction observations in those composites , being mostly due to photonic crystal diffraction @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we thoroughly investigate the photonic band structure of an array of core - shell metal - semiconductor nws , which was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite through parameter retrieval to exhibit low - loss , negative index behavior .",
    "this allows us to rigorously demonstrate ( through equifrequency surfaces ) and improve ( fine tuning core - shell geometrical parameters ) its highly isotropic character .",
    "indeed , taking advantage of high isotropy and low losses , flat - lens focusing is presented through thick slabs with subwavelength resolution and dipole position independence , in good agreement with the expected behavior for a homogeneous slab with effective parameters as retrieved for the nw array .",
    "limitations are also investigated with regard to image resolution , photonic - crystal surface termination , and disorder .",

    "iii , the performance of such nw arrays in the canonical example of flat - lens focusing through a thick slab , as compared with a homogeneous slab with the retrieved electric permittivity and magnetic permeability .",
    "this is also done for plane wave refraction through a prism in sec .",
    "iv , introducing in turn disorder to support the robustness of the nw array as a low - loss optical nim .",
    "finally , section v contains our concluding remarks .",
    "first of all , we characterize the electromagnetic wave propagation in the 2d periodic composite medium consisting of core - shell metal - dielectric ( infinitely long ) nws in a regular hexagonal array ( see fig .  [ fig - csnwarray ] ) . for this purpose ,",
    "we plot in fig .",

    "the photonic bands present a partial gap in the @xmath10 m direction in the first band and a full gap between the third and fourth bands . besides , the slope of the second one is negative , and corresponds to a mode propagation with a negative phase velocity , as evidenced in the right graphs in fig .",

    "the partial gaps and the full gap at 300 thz are clearly observed .",
    "more importantly , the nearly isotropic character of the second band is inferred , improving upon slightly increasing the nw inner radius from a dispersion of 10 thz ( @xmath11 ) with wavevector direction shift for @xmath8 80 nm , to a mere 2 thz ( @xmath12 ) for @xmath8 90 nm .",
    "in order to clarify isotropy of the wave propagation properties in the second band we plot in fig .  [",

    "[ fig - aphband+isofreq](a ) ] , bearing in mind the hexagonal symmetry of the crystal . in the beginning of the second band , at 215 thz ( @xmath13 m ) , we have the well known pockets due to the partial gap along the @xmath10 m direction , whereas the only allowed propagation modes are close to the @xmath10k directions . for frequencies above the partial gap [ see fig .  [ fig - aphband+isofreq](a ) ] , all the mode propagation directions are again available and the efss become more circular , as shown at 235 thz ( @xmath14 m ) : isotropy is indeed remarkable for the nw @xmath8 90 nm inner radius at 245 thz ( 1.22 @xmath15 m ) , with a nearly circular efs . then , as the frequency is further increased , at 270 thz ( 1.11 @xmath15 m ) and at 280 thz ( 1.07 @xmath15 m ) , the efss of the second bands shrink and deform ( become more hexagonal ) , overlapping with the third - band pockets appearing along the @xmath10k directions , thus breaking isotropy .",
    "overall , it should be emphasized that there is a wide frequency range ( 215260 thz ) in which the efss are almost circular ( specially for @xmath8 90 nm ) and the crystal might be described as an isotropic negative - index medium .",

    "indeed , the retrieved refractive index for @xmath8 90 nm yields an extremely large value of the @xmath23 . recall that the absorptive losses of a single core - shell nw are very small @xcite , so that the remaining ( small , but non - negligible ) nim losses are very likely due to scattering .",

    "the results for a homogeneous slab are also shown , with @xmath27 and @xmath28 , so that @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) as obtained in fig .   at 1.28 @xmath15 m . ]",
    "incidentally , note that @xmath17 and @xmath18 do not become -1 at the same frequency , which results in an impedance @xmath31 .",
    "further tuning of the core - shell nw parameters could be done in order to achieve the ideal @xmath32 ; despite that , the resulting impedance is only slightly larger than 1 so that reflections at the interface are small , as will be shown below .",
    "however , at this point the important issue needs to be addressed whether or not this structure behaves as an isotropic homogeneous medium .",
    "to verify that the core - shell nw array presents an isotropic negative index of refraction , rather than considering plane wave negative refraction ( which has been confirmed up to large angles of incidence in ref .  ) , we study the imaging of a point source through a slab , which no doubt places a more stringent test for it involves all plane wave angular components .",
    "we carry out numerical simulations of the transmission of the electromagnetic field radiated by an in - plane point dipole source at 235 thz ( 1.28 @xmath15 m ) placed in front of a finite ( 22 nw thick , namely , 6.7 @xmath15 m long ) slab made of the structure studied in the previous section ( see the appendix for the parameters of the fem calculations ) ; we focus on the @xmath7 nm case , which exhibits slightly higher isotropy . in fig .",
    "[ fig - slab ] we plot the norm of the electric field ( left column ) and the poynting vector ( right column ) , respectively , for a dipole parallel to the surface of the slab ( top ) , clearly revealing the effects of a medium that possesses a negative index of refraction . at the slab interfaces",
    ", light undergoes negative refraction and its field components are focused twice , one inside and other outside of the slab : the image produced on the other side of the slab presents similarities with the real one . for a dipole perpendicular to the slab ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - slab ] , bottom ) , again , we see the same phenomenology of negative refraction through the slab with the expected focusing effect for this dipole orientation .",
    "in addition , it is remarkable the fact that the poynting vector is always zero along the propagation direction parallel to the dipole moment axis , so that light undergoes no significant spurious scattering losses when traveling through the photonic crystal ; which in turn contributes to the effective medium parameters as losses , reportedly extremely small in this nim @xcite , and thus in agreement with the above simulations",
    ".        therefore the main features of flat lensing are fully retrieved @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the agreement is remarkable with the results ( shown also in fig .",
    "[ fig - slab ] ) obtained upon considering an isotropic and homogeneous slab with effective parameters at 1.28 @xmath15 m given in fig .  [ fig - effconst ] : it should be emphasized that the ( linear ) color scale of both the electric field ( left ) and poynting vector ( right ) norms are identical in all plots ( columns ) , either for the nw array or for the homogeneous medium , and also that the scale is neither saturated nor altered within the slabs .",
    "remarkably , note that very similar transmitted foci are produced : this is explicitly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - focus ] , where the power transmitted at the image plane is presented for both the nw array and the homogeneous lenses .",
    "the full - width at half - maximum is of the order of 0.65 @xmath15m@xmath33 , yielding subwavelength resolution .",
    "of course , since the source is not located deep in the near - field , superlensing in the proper sense @xcite can not be observed and resolution is diffraction limited ( ultimately , resolution should be limited for the nw array to nw diameter ) .",
    "overall , we clearly observe the phenomenology of ( all - angle ) negative refraction at the interface of the slab and the flat - lens focusing process .",

    "according to the canonical nim focusing effect ( keeping the slab thickness fixed ) , if the dipole source is closer ( respectively , farther ) to the slab , the virtual image inside the slab gets closer ( respectively , farther ) , whereas the image behind the slab appears farther ( respectively , closer ) from the slab surface ; this is properly reproduced by the numerical calculations for the ag@si core - shell nanowire array .",

    "nonetheless , we would like to stress that the direction along which the array is terminated at the surface plays a crucial role despite isotropy .",
    "we calculate in fig .",
    "[ fig - dip - gk ] the dipole source transmission through a slab identical to that used in fig .",
    "[ fig - slab ] , except for the fact that the slab surface is along the @xmath10k direction : it is evident that nim focusing is remarkably worse .",
    "two effects contribute to hinder it .",
    "first , surface roughness is larger along the @xmath10k direction , thus leading to larger scattering losses from single surface nanowires , as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig - dip - gk ] through both larger electromagnetic fields on the slab surface close to the source , and larger reflection losses .",
    "second , momentum conservation parallel to the @xmath10k direction leads to a scenario different from that along @xmath10 m : apart from the expected negatively refracted beam , another refracted beam appears beyond a relatively small incidence angle as a diffracted beam at nearest brillouin zone .",
    "this implies that dipole source components at a certain angle with respect to the surface normal exhibit two diffracted beams that preclude proper nim focusing : such behavior is evidenced in fig .",

    "however , it has been shown that ordered configurations that exhibit a negative index of refraction may lose such effective property when the geometry is disordered . in this regard",
    ", it should be recalled that it has been shown in other cylinder arrays that mie resonances ( rather than bragg scattering ) govern in part the appearance of spectrally overlapping , photonic band gaps and higher - order bands @xcite . therefore ,",
    "if mie ( rather than bragg ) scattering underlies the negative - index behavior , the latter should be more tolerant to disorder than usual photonic crystals .    in order to show the robustness of doubly resonant nws ,",
    "let us show first in fig .",
    "[ fig - prism ] the classical plane wave refraction through a rectangular prism with an angle of @xmath43 , which actually involves two interfaces terminated in different photonic crystal directions ( see the appendix for details of the fem numerical calculations ) .",
    "we can see how the wavefronts leave the prisms above the normal , a clear signature of a nim medium . indeed , the full simulation of the wave propagation ( see video 1 in ref . ,",
    "supplementary information ) revealed that the wavefronts travel backward inside the prism ( negative phase velocity ) , characteristic of a system having simultaneously negative permittivity and permeability .",
    "the homogeneous prism with the retrieved effective parameters nicely reproduces the expected negative refraction , thus further supporting the accuracy of the effective parameters and the nim behavior of the nw array .",
    "we now introduce disorder in the prism geometry used in fig .",
    "[ fig - prism ] : in essence , some of the constituents are either shifted or removed from their original position in the ordered lattice . in fig .",
    "[ fig - disorderprism](a ) we explicitly show the nws that have been shifted from their array positions in the prism and in fig .",
    "[ fig - disorderprism](b ) the plane wave propagation into the disordered prism .",
    "although the wavefronts are somewhat perturbed by disorder upon crossing the prism and in the very near field region , we still observe the two key feature that characterize the negative index of refraction : an angle of transmission above the normal of the surface and a backward propagation of the wavefronts ( negative phase velocity ) .     built with ag@si core - shell nanowires with @xmath44 80 nm and @xmath45 170 nm arranged in a hexagonal lattice ( @xmath46 nm ) illuminated by a ( transverse electric ) plane wave parallel to the left interface at 1.215 @xmath15 m .",
    "disorder is introduced in two different manners : ( top left ) some of the nws ( darker ) are shifted by an average of  1.5 nm ; ( bottom left ) some of the nws are removed .",
    "right column : corresponding contour maps of the amplitude of the magnetic field ( out - of - plane ) component . ]    moreover , such nim features are preserved even if stronger scattering disorder is introduced , as shown in the lower panel in fig .",

    "bear in mind that , apart from positional disorder , if the nw filling fraction is substantially diminished , a decrease in the ( absolute ) values of the negative effective parameters is expected @xcite .",

    "[ fig - slab ] , again by shifting some of the nws from their original position in the ordered lattice , as shown in fig .  [ fig - disorderslab ] .",
    "note that , to make more relevant the impact of disorder , the shifted nws are located in the central part of the slab , through which most of the dipole transmitted power is concentrated .",
    "a moderate amount of disorder ( top ) does not disturb the flat - lens focusing .",
    "only when the number of shifted nws increases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - disorderslab ] , bottom ) , the transmitted pattern is slightly altered , though the transmitted focal spot is still reproduced .",
    "vacancy disorder ( not shown here ) is extremely sensitive in this case to the vacant position for obvious reasons , leading to strong scattering if placed nearby the intermediate focus region inside the slab , as expected .",
    "nevertheless , we have shown that the properties of our closely packed , doubly - resonant nws are not only due to the periodicity of the lattice , but do survive even if substantial ( either positional or vacancy - like ) disorder is introduced , bearing in mind that filling fraction should be preserved .",
    "in conclusion , we have carried out a full description of the photonic band structure of doubly - resonant core - shell metallo - dielectric nanowire arrays , in order to demonstrate their behavior as low - loss , isotropic bulk optical nims , as reported in ref . from the retrieved effective medium parameters .",
    "this must be done , as pointed out in ref .  , to rule out that their negative refraction behavior is mainly a photonic - crystal diffraction effect that depends on the specific geometry sample .",
    "the 2d photonic band structure has been presented , identifying the second photonic band with negative - index properties .",
    "the resulting efss in the first brillouin zone are circular for most of this band , thus indicating the full ( 2d ) isotropic character .",
    "in addition , such isotropic nim behavior is very clearly evidenced through numerical simulations in canonical examples for finite geometries : namely , point dipole transmission through a slab and negative refraction through a prism . both cases are compared to the same configurations , but for a slab / prism characterized by homogeneous dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability exactly given by the effective parameter retrieval ( from s - parameters ) , in very good agreement .",
    "this further confirms the effective ( highly isotropic ) bulk nim behavior , in turn explicitly manifesting the extremely low losses and suitable ( close to 1 ) impedance .",
    "finally , disorder is introduced in such finite prisms to support the robustness of the nw structures as nims , inferring that mie resonances ( rather than bragg scattering ) govern to a large extent their optical properties .    in this manner , we have rigorously demonstrated ( and improved ) the highly isotropic and ultra low - loss ( @xmath23 ) character of ag@si nanowire arrays , exhibiting indeed robust flat lensing with subwavelength resolution and dipole position independence , in good agreement with the expected behavior for a negative - index homogeneous slab . our results and procedure serve to fully assess such fascinating properties as optical nims of the doubly - resonant core - shell metallo - dielectric nanowire arrays , paving the way towards realistic fabrication thanks to the tolerance to specific geometric considerations and inhomogeneities .",

    "an eigenfrequency study is applied to the unit cell upon bloch boundary conditions to reproduce an infinite system .",
    "the calculated photonic band direction is determined by the periodicity of the @xmath47-vector .    in the case of the metameterial slabs , the simulated space consisted of an hexagonal array of of core - shell nanowires of height @xmath48 6.7 @xmath15 m and length @xmath49 35 @xmath15 m ( 22x100 nanowires ) , representing the slab , centered in a rectangle three times thicker than the slab and with the same length .",

    "for the homogeneous slab , the simulated space is the same as the metamaterial slab , but replacing the periodic array by a rectangle of the same @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and applying a transition boundary condition to its boundaries , setting its thickness to 1 nm and its optical properties to those of the surrounding medium ( air ) .    in all cases ,",
    "silicon was assumed lossless in the frequency range studied , with a refractive index of @xmath52 and silver material constant were taken from experimental values from @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic properties of the homogeneous medium were those determined by s - parameter retrieval procedure as in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the rest of the space was set to be air ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the meshing was done with the program built - in algorithm , which creates a triangular mesh . for photonic band structure calculations , the mesh maximum element size ( mes )",
    "was set to 7.4 nm and the maximum element growth rate ( megr ) to @xmath54 .",
    "in addition , opposite edges of the unit cell were meshed identically by using the copy edge feature to ensure the symmetry of the system . for the transmission of the electromagnetic field radiated by a dipole ,",
