    "the introduction of the spin - orbit term into the nuclear single - particle hamiltonian by haxel , jensen , suess and goeppert - mayer @xcite in 1949 has been most decisive for the success of the nuclear shell model . only with a very strong and attractive spin - orbit potential",
    "one is , for example , able to explain the observed sequence of so - called magic numbers @xmath18 .",
    "the dynamical origin of the strong nuclear spin - orbit force has not been fully resolved even up to date .",
    "the analogy with the spin - orbit interaction in atomic physics gave the hint that it could be a relativistic effect .",
    "this idea has lead to the construction of the relativistic ( scalar - vector ) mean - field model @xcite . in this model the spin - independent nuclear potential ( of approximate depth @xmath19mev )",
    "results from an almost complete cancelation of a very strong attraction generated by scalar ( @xmath20-meson ) exchange and a nearly equally strong repulsion generated by vector ( @xmath21-meson ) exchange .",
    "the corresponding spin - orbit term ( obtained by a non - relativistic reduction of the nucleon s dirac - hamiltonian ) comes out proportional to the coherent sum of the very large scalar and vector mean - fields . in this sense",
    ", the relativistic mean - field model gives a simple and natural explanation of the basic features of the nuclear shell model potential .",
    "refinements of relativistic mean - field models which include additional non - linear couplings of the scalar and vector fields or explicitly density - dependent couplings are nowadays widely and successfully used for nuclear structure calculations @xcite .",
    "the nuclear spin - orbit potential arises generally as a many - body effect from the underlying spin - orbit term in the ( free ) nucleon - nucleon scattering amplitude .",
    "the calculation of the tree level diagrams with one scalar - meson or one vector - meson exchange between nucleons gives indeed a spin - orbit term in the nn t - matrix proportional to @xmath22 , with @xmath23 denoting the nucleon mass .",
    "the nuclear spin - orbit potential corresponding to scalar and vector meson exchange is therefore obviously a truly relativistic effect .",
    "however , the quadratic reciprocal scaling of the spin - orbit nn - amplitude with the nucleon mass @xmath23 is not universal , and it changes if one considers the exchange of two mesons between nucleons , i.e. loop diagrams .",
    "for example , irreducible two - pion exchange gives rise to a spin - orbit term in the nn t - matrix proportional to @xmath24 ( see eqs.(22,23 ) in ref.@xcite ) and iterated one - pion exchange produces a spin - orbit term in the nn t - matrix which even scales linearly with the nucleon mass @xmath23 ( see eq.(33 ) in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it is one of the chief purposes of this paper to investigate in detail the contributions from iterated one - pion exchange to the nuclear spin - orbit interaction .",
    "as already mentioned the latter arises from the spin - orbit term in the nn t - matrix as a many - body effect , e.g. in connection with a nuclear matter calculation .    in a recent work @xcite",
    ", we have used chiral perturbation theory for a systematic treatment of the nuclear matter many - body problem . in this calculation the contributions to the energy per particle , @xmath25 , originate exclusively from one- and two - pion exchange between nucleons and they are ordered in powers of the fermi momentum @xmath26 ( modulo functions of @xmath27 ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated in ref.@xcite that the empirical saturation point and the nuclear matter compressibility @xmath28mev can be well reproduced at order @xmath29 in the chiral expansion with just one single momentum cut - off scale of @xmath30gev which parametrizes all necessary short range dynamics .",
    "most surprisingly , the prediction for the asymmetry energy , @xmath31mev , is in very good agreement with its empirical value .",
    "furthermore , as a nontrivial fact pure neutron matter is predicted to be unbound and the corresponding equation of state agrees roughly with that of sophisticated many - body calculations for low neutron densities @xmath32@xmath33 .",
    "in a subsequent work @xcite , the momentum and density dependent ( real ) single - particle potential @xmath34 ( i.e. the spin - independent average nuclear mean - field ) has been calculated in the same framework .",
    "it was found that chiral @xmath2- and @xmath14-exchange give rise to a potential depth for a nucleon at the bottom of the fermi sea of @xmath35mev .",
    "this value is in very good agreement with the depth of the empirical optical model potential and the nuclear shell model potential .",
    "nuclear matter at finite temperatures has been investigated in the same framework in ref.@xcite .",
    "there it was shown that chiral @xmath2- and @xmath14-exchange reproduce the first - order liquid - gas phase transition of isospin symmetric nuclear matter with a realistic value @xmath36mev of the critical temperature .",
    "our approach to the nuclear matter problem is in many respects different from most other commonly used ones , where one starts from a so - called realistic nn - potential .",
    "for example in the relativistic nuclear matter calculation of ref.@xcite the @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39-waves deliver more than 95% of the potential energy per particle .",
    "the finding that perturbative chiral pion - nucleon dynamics leads already to good nuclear matter and single particle properties hints at the fact that the detailed nn - interaction is of no more relevance .",
    "fine - tuning of the single cut - off scale @xmath40 to one nuclear matter observable ( the binding energy per particle @xmath41 ) is however still necessary in our present approach @xcite .    it is the purpose of this work to calculate , using the same framework as in ref.@xcite , the momentum and density dependent nuclear spin - orbit strength @xmath0 .",
    "this quantity is derived from the spin - dependent part of the interaction energy @xmath42 of a nucleon scattering off weakly inhomogeneous isospin symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "we will present here analytical expressions for the contributions from @xmath2-exchange and iterated @xmath2-exchange to the spin - orbit strength @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , we calculate in isospin asymmetric ( homogeneous ) nuclear matter the ( complex - valued ) isovector single - particle potential @xmath43 accompanied by the isospin double - asymmetry @xmath16 .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * at nuclear matter saturation density , @xmath3mev , @xmath2-exchange and iterated @xmath2-exchange generate a spin - orbit strength at @xmath4 of @xmath44mev@xmath6 .",
    "this result , which is dominated by the contribution of four hartree - type diagrams , is in perfect agreement with the empirical value of the spin - orbit strength @xmath45mev@xmath6",
    "@xcite used in shell - model calculation of nuclei .",
    "the novel spin - orbit strength found here is neither of relativistic nor of short range origin .",
    "it is in fact linearly proportional to the nucleon mass @xmath23 and its inherent range is the pion compton wavelength @xmath46fm .",
    "the latter feature tempts to an unconventional interpretation of the strong nuclear spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the potential @xmath7 underlying the empirical spin - orbit strength @xmath47mev@xmath6 becomes a rather weak one , namely @xmath48mev , after the identification of the effective range @xmath49 with the pion compton wavelength , @xmath50 , as suggested by the present calculation .",
    "* we observe however a strong @xmath11-dependence of @xmath12 which leads even to a sign change above @xmath13mev . the calculated spin - orbit strength @xmath51 depends also strongly on the value of the pion mass and it shows a pronounced maximum around @xmath52mev .",
    "a further property of the spin - orbit hamiltonian emerging from our diagrammatic calculation is that it has ( in coordinate space ) terms proportional to @xmath53 as well as terms proportional to @xmath54 ( with @xmath55 the normalized radial density profile ) which get weighted differently at the surface of a finite nucleus .",
    "all such features of our calculation which go beyond the usual shell model parametrization of the spin - orbit hamiltonian leave questions about the ultimate relevance of the spin - orbit interaction generated by @xmath14-exchange for a finite nucleus . implementing the present results for @xmath0 into nuclear structure calculations will clarify the role of the nuclear spin - orbit interaction generated by @xmath14-exchange .",
    "* the real part of the isovector single - particle potential @xmath56 generated by chiral @xmath2- and @xmath14-exchange has a density dependence very similar to that of the asymmetry energy @xmath57 @xcite . at saturation density , @xmath58@xmath33 , we find a repulsive isovector potential of @xmath59mev .",
    "this prediction is comparable to the value @xmath60mev used in shell model calculations @xcite or the value @xmath61mev deduced from nucleon - nucleus scattering in the framework of the optical model @xcite .",
    "the momentum dependence of @xmath62 is non - monotonic in the interval @xmath63 .",
    "one observes a broad maximum at @xmath64mev where the ( real ) isovector single - particle potential has increased by about 30% to the value @xmath65mev .",
    "the imaginary part @xmath66 vanishes ( quadratically ) at the fermi - surface @xmath67 in accordance with luttinger s theorem @xcite .",
    "let us begin with recalling the spin - orbit hamiltonian of the nuclear shell model @xcite which is generally written in the form : @xmath68 here , @xmath69 is the conventional pauli spin - vector and @xmath70 is the orbital angular momentum of a nucleon .",
    "@xmath71 denotes the radial density distribution of a nucleus ( typically parametrized by a saxon - woods function ) .",
    "the empirical value of the nuclear spin - orbit strength is @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "this large and positive value of @xmath73 leads to a strongly attractive spin - orbit potential acting mainly at the surface of a nucleus .",
    "we wish to calculate the nuclear spin - orbit strength @xmath73 ( or an appropriate generalization of it ) in the systematic framework of chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the first observation one makes is that the spin - orbit interaction vanishes identically in infinite homogeneous nuclear matter since there is no preferred center in this system in order to define an orbital angular momentum .",
    "therefore one has to generalize the calculation of the single - particle potential in ref.@xcite to ( at least ) weakly inhomogeneous nuclear matter . the relevant quantity in order to extract the nuclear spin - orbit strength is the spin - dependent part of the interaction energy of a nucleon scattering off weakly inhomogeneous isospin symmetric nuclear matter from initial momentum @xmath74 to final momentum @xmath75 , which reads : @xmath76 the ( small ) momentum transfer @xmath77 is provided by the fourier - components of the inhomogeneous nuclear matter distribution .",
    "the density form factor @xmath78 plays the role of a probability distribution of these fourier - components .",
    "the form factor @xmath79 should be viewed as narrowly peaked function around @xmath80 with its fourier - transform equal to the ( slowly varying ) density profile , @xmath81 .",
    "using this relationship the spin - orbit hamiltonian @xmath82 in eq.(1 ) becomes equal to the fourier - transform of the product of the density form factor and the spin - dependent interaction energy : @xmath83 .",
    "consistent with the assumption of a weakly inhomogeneous nuclear matter distribution we keep in @xmath84 only linear terms in @xmath77 corresponding to small spatial density gradients . for practical purposes",
    ", this means that after isolating the proportionality factor @xmath77 in an explicit calculation the momentum and density dependent spin - orbit strength @xmath0 can be finally computed in the limit of homogeneous isospin symmetric nuclear matter ( characterized by its fermi momentum @xmath26 ) .",
